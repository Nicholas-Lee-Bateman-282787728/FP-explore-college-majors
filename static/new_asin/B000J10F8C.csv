2666027,5,B000J10F8C,"Good lord this film scared the hell out of me! Not that I was ever considering trying this disgusting drug but I certainly would never ever go with in a thousand miles of this stuff after watching this. Every single school student should be shown this film because the shocking effects of this drug are the most powerful tool to stopping them from ever thinking about using.

The most horrifying part was hearing the actual 911 call of a first time meth user who had stopped her car in a forest and was convinced there were people all around her car stopping her from getting out when it was completely a meth induced hellucination. Frightening stuff.

If you are a teacher considering purchasing this for a class I insist you buy it straight away.",1171238400,25,748,4.574626865671642
2666028,5,B000J10F8C,"This documentary gets the word out loud and clear: Crystal Methamphetamine is the worst possible drug out there. A user will eventually, and almost without exception, get addicted to Meth and getting off it is HELL!! Meth steals your soul and personality.  You become a thieving, paranoid sex maniac. Don't ever try it - Not even once!!",1169164800,21,336,4.894736842105263
2666029,5,B000J10F8C,"I have seen this program on the NG Channel and thought it was excellent.  I too teach drug eduation to high school stuents, and am looking forward to adding it to my library.  The program is so much better than your standard ""don't do drugs"" videos that we have from years past.  Whether you think meth or tobacco or something else is the world's most dangerous drug doesn't matter here.  You can show this film to a group of young people and then do follow-up activities with them about drug abuse, the development of addicition and how the abuse of ANY drug can negatively affect the lives of the user, family, friends and the greater society.  Also, meth is becoming a huge problem, and the kids at my school know it.  I will definitely buy this DVD and use it in the classroom.",1168646400,16,781,4.426573426573427
2666030,5,B000J10F8C,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I have actually seen this video, and have shown it in my highschool classes.  NG presents a thought provoking and sometimes disturbing look into the world of meth users, and graphically shows the physical and mental impacts of the drug.  I highly recommend this video for anyone involved in drug education.",1166140800,41,336,5.090909090909091
2666031,1,B000J10F8C,"This is about ""meth""? Give me a break! The world's most dangerous drug is TOBACCO! Tobacco kills more than 5,000,000 users and hundreds of thousands more (innocent) people that breathe toxic tobacco smoke, around the world every year. Tobacco is addictive, defective and lethal, when used as intended. TOBACCO IS THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS DRUG, not ""meth"" or anything else. C'mon Nat. G., get real! You've sold out.",1165536000,23,416,5.132352941176471

2666044,2,B000J10F8C,"I returned this video because it was not something I could use for educational purposes.  It opens graphically with intention to frighten.  In my experience with substance users and addicts, they respond negatively to such tactics--blocking them out, refusing to watch or stating ""I don't have that problem.""  It serves to terrify family members and professionals assisting to help loved ones and clients with addictions more than we're already terrified.  The worst part of the return was that it cost me half the price of the video for the seller's 'restocking fee,' which was mentioned nowhere in their promise of the refund.  After postage, restocking, etc. I lost money in the transaction.  I would have been better off throwing it in the garbage.",1399939200,,752,5.073170731707317

2666047,2,B000J10F8C,There is too much drug use and constant pictures of the drug. It becomes distracting from the message of the danger,1392076800,3,115,4.523809523809524

2666051,5,B000J10F8C,By far the best treatment video I have seen in a while. My groups have loved it as have co-workers. It makes a strong impression on clients. I have several who are recovering meth users and they stated it is spot on.,1383523200,4,216,4.166666666666667
2666062,4,B000J10F8C,"I was reluctant to utilize this DVD due to its graphic depictions of drug use and its focus on the production and distribution of drugs.  However, I have included it in my groups within the ong-term correctional setting where the problems of it triggering drug cravings and of those cravings leading to drug use are minimized.  It can be difficult to select portions of the videos since you have to ""click through"" the sections rather than just select chapters.  As with many difficulties it was minimized with experience and I can more easily choose what I wish to present.",1377561600,4,574,4.777777777777778
2666063,5,B000J10F8C,"The topic is meth, as viciously addictive drug relatively cheap drug combining hyperactivity with delusion effects that lasts up to 12 hours/dose. It brings euphoria and causes some to react in a violent fashion. Other effects include rotting teeth, appetite suppression, and brain damage.

Efforts to stamp out local 'labs' have been reasonably successful (and made it more difficult to obtain sinus medication), but that source has been replaced by Mexican sources.

Only one aspect was missing - it failed to explain why one 20-year user seemed physically unharmed, though still tempted at times to re-use after a year of abstinence. I certainly hope he's continued to stay away.",1374883200,,682,5.247706422018348

2666066,5,B000J10F8C,If you have children and their behavior changes this might be the movie that lets you know what happened. After watching this film I now can tell when someone is on Meth.

I figured for the few dollars it cost and with having 3 growing boys, compounded with the onset of this drug....  It was a small price to pay to make it available to my Soldiers and my 3 boys.  Highly recommendecd.  You can view it online if you google it, I wanted a high quality copy and the ability to play ""off-line"" for the guys at work during testing.",1362873600,,502,4.144329896907217

2666096,5,B000J10F8C,I have used this video several times with incarcerated youth with histories of drug use.  It is very well done and they receive it well.  It is not preachy but lays out the facts and tells significant personal histories of experiences with meth in a powerful manner.  I strongly recommend it for anyone doing drug education.--Steve,1337731200,2,331,4.875
2666097,5,B000J10F8C,"I wouldn't call it the world's most dangerous drug, but it looks to me like it deserves a place at the top of the list of the world's worst drugs. If you have seen Heroin Crisis, you'll know that Heroin is truly the world's most dangerous drug.

2666099,5,B000J10F8C,"I purchased the DVD ""World's Most Dangerous Drug."" because of the number of signs I see up in the community warning youth against the use of Meth.  I counsel youth and this video shows the negative consequences of Meth use.  The reasons to use, it's effect on the mind, burns from explosions; it helps for the youth to be able to see the things which go on.  Hopefully ""seeing is believing.""  The video included everything, very informative.

2666100,4,B000J10F8C,"The World's Most Dangerous Drug is a documentary that examines the devastating impact of meth. The film explains that meth has displaced cocaine as the street ""drug of choice"" because meth provides a 6-12-hour high, which is much longer than cocaine. Also, meth is easy to manufacture, so users don't necessarily need a drug connection to supply their habits.

One drawback of the film was that much of the material was already familiar to me. For instance, there are plenty of pictures of ""meth mouth"" - the awful tooth decay suffered by many meth users. Also, the film contains dated series of arrest photos that show what happens to the same person over time - as meth destroys the person's body. Still, at just 50 minutes, I was never bored.

A scene that will stay with viewers involves an interview with a police officer who shows booking photos of a meth user whom the cop had known when both were kids. The filmmakers contact the meth user who sadly admits that he has given twenty years of his life to meth. Another strong scene explains meth's impact in Thailand, where many manual laborers use meth to put in longer hours.

While The World's Most Dangerous Drug didn't teach me a lot, it was very engaging and I recommend the film.",1298851200,3,1242,4.636363636363637
2666101,3,B000J10F8C,"The title ""World's Most Dangerous Drug"" is certainly intriguing, but I was annoyed that neither the product description nor the product itself (packaging) explained which drug is the subject of this documentary. I don't appreciate being ""teased"" by National Geographic into buying their product just to find out. Thanks to the customer reviews here on Amazon, I learned that the subject of this documentary is methamphetamine. I had guessed from the title that this video was about alcohol and alcoholism. One could argue that alcohol causes more damage to people's lives, in sheer numbers and loss of life, than does meth. If anyone at Amazon is reading this review, please update the product description to clearly explain the topic of this documentary.",1281052800,19,755,5.19672131147541
2666112,5,B000J10F8C,"I am a substance abuse counselor and have shown this video to some of my clients. The individuals that are addicted to Meth reported triggers to use. The non-meth addicts thought it was a great video, lots of information and intertaining. If you are planing to show this to meth addicts please be prepaired to do some major processing after viewing. It is a great video.",1257379200,3,370,4.621212121212121

It is very factual, non-judgemental, and interesting.  The documentary combines user interviews, with clinical and police interviews, making for a very balanced approach.  Also, it uses graphics to show you what meth is doing inside a person's brain.

2666119,5,B000J10F8C,"This was a very educational production with considerable first hand footage and field reporting. That's what we expect from National Geographic and that's what we get here. The photo comparisons of the premature aging of meth users--""Faces of Meth""--was as depressing as it was compelling. The side effects of this drug are absolutely horrific, and the parts about ""meth mouth"" are tough to watch. You'll also see a side of Thailand you never knew existed. Before viewing this, I would have never previously thought one drug was more dangerous than any other but I was wrong.",1193443200,38,575,5.0
2666120,4,B000J10F8C,"I know a little bit about different kinds of drugs due to some law enforcement training I've had but after seeing National Geographic's special on methamphetamines, it became instantly clear to me that this is the most frightening controlled substance I've ever seen.

On the streets it is referred to as Crystal, Ice, and Crank.  Methamphetamines are viciously addictive and provide the hyperactivity effects of Cocaine along with the delusional effects of LSD.  As opposed to getting a short `high' from other drugs, this one will keep users pumped up from 6 to 12 hours and create feelings of paranoia, invulnerability, increased strength, euphoria, and may cause some to react in a violent fashion.  As for health concerns, it rots the teeth, suppresses the appetite, induces insomnia, and causes brain damage among other things. Its ease of use makes it even more insidious as it can be swallowed, snorted, injected, or smoked and it is cheap to buy or can be easily manufactured by almost anyone.

Methamphetamines can be found in virtually every community from the smallest towns to the largest cities and it radiates through all walks of life from the lowest to highest social classes.  It is estimated that there are 26 million worldwide users of this drug.  When law enforcement in the United States began to make a concerted effort to eliminate methamphetamine labs, supply then began to come from Mexico using routes already established by Cocaine Cartels.

`The World's Most Dangerous Drug' is only 50 minutes long but this is more than enough time to fully realize the shocking and devastating effects of methamphetamines.  There are some graphic photos and a few disturbing video clips but they are necessary elements in complimenting and reinforcing the main message of this program.  National Geographic has made a decent documentary here, in my opinion, and whether viewers want to watch this for educational purposes or just out of curiosity perhaps, I recommend it to everyone.",1181865600,135,1997,5.098159509202454
