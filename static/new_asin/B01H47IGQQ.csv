8764628,5,B01H47IGQQ,"This is a review by Oscar Jaeger, Lois's husband. Lois and I saw this movie recently at a theater in Manhattan. We then purchased this DVD and arranged for it be shipped to friends of ours in France. See this movie if you can, whether in a theater or on a DVD (make sure you have the right DVD player or you won't be able to play this DVD). The movie tells the story of Cline, a medical doctor and genius writer who was, at the same time, an anti-Semite. Since his anti-Semitism does not show up in his novels, he may be said to have had a kind of split personality. The movie  brilliantly reveals both sides, angelic and devilish, of this complicated individual.",1489795200,,663,4.304
