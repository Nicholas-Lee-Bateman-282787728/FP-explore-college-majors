2754644,5,B000N3T0HI,"Was told by a friend to rent this movie. But never could find it in stock at the local video store. So bought one from amazon so that I could keep it. The movie was sad to know that this stuff is still going on with all these gangs. It is a shame that the govt., or church or school can't reach out and help stop this cycle of crazy life style for these young ones. They are our future..and they are only fighting and killing each other. Then they go to prison and it is the same thing inside prison. These kids are the losers of so much in life. Then they have their parents in the free world to pick up the pieces and to go on living with a heavy heart.",1206748800,5,655,3.8955223880597014

2754694,5,B000N3T0HI,"American Me (1992), is an uncommonly  absorbing, introspective
movie, not so much dealing with gangs, as dealing with the subject
of one's own identity in face of other individuals, other groups,
other cliques. At length,  creating or joining a clique or gang
may facilitate or solve the problem of  seeking  one's own
identity, purpose in life, and place in society at large.

Clearly, to a lesser or greater degree, viewers will relate to
peer-pressure scenarios, whether as part of the military, working
for a company, an association, a community organization, etc.

Edward James Olmos, plays the leader of the eMe, spotlessly
portraying the leader who is highly sensitive and aware of what
constitutes leadership, which is the importance in creating,
maintaining a particular image for success in the clique, which is
to say in controlling perceptions at large, to command as well the
respect of rival group members.

He is great at this, having graduated to the boss position from a
""professional"" track record, extending  from youth to adulthood,
always with the same particular type of people or members
comprising his organization, or those of rivals.

William Forsythe, (also seen in Gotti, for example) has an equally
fascinating appearance  throughout the movie, as a no-nonsense
gangster.

The cinematography is impeccable, as is the case with the sound,
and musical accompaniment or soundtrack, with subtitles and a true
wide-screen.

There is a fair bit of gang jargon throughout, despite the
subtitles will  mystify viewers.

In gangs or cliques, nobody is above the clan's or clique's
commandments, including the top dog, as the disciplined members
are pigeon-holed into a lifestyle (they often know of no other)
and as such, become dependent professionals in both behavior and
conduct after a period of time -  their reactions to any deviance
being mechanical, and automatic. This upbringing and lifestyle, or
belief system, can be larger than life, larger than what humans
sometimes  can control themselves.

There is also a litany of detention centers listed, such as
Folsom, Chino, Soledad, Vacaville, etc. The business motives are
clearly explained,  from extortion, sex, gambling, substances.

Perhaps the downfall of a leader is being out of touch with
members, either for love, passion, lack of experience in dealing
with distractions, resulting in a shaky adherence to  gang
commandments.

A strenth  of the movie, is the historical accuracy and concern
for an entire community in face of other  communities that were
well established in USA, the resulting tensions and the challenges
for acceptance.

It also is highly original and brave in not shying away from
showing the ugly reality as it is.",1238198400,5,2722,5.247685185185185
