8123683,4,B000FJHFRC,"I got this DVD at the Rio Grande Bird Festival. I am really enjoying it! Yes, some of the birds are only shown for a second or 2, and it is hard to write down your answers in such a short time (especially for Cape May warblers), but that is how it is in the real world for some of these birds. I am learning a lot and will use it as a review when I travel to these locations. It is a nice mix of easy and hard to identify birds.
I hope they do a volume 2 of some other hot spots!",1384819200,,479,3.6153846153846154
8123684,2,B000FJHFRC,"This is a DVD which is true to the name of the production name - Brown Bag Productions. It is a compilation of very short scenes of different birds at different locations some of which are OK and most are only look like ""run and gun"". It looks like to me that the filmmakers travelled to good birding locations and took some short takes of the birds they found and are now trying to make some money to pay for the trip. It is not very well done with no sound or narrative. You have to go to another track to find the names of the birds unless you make a listing of the birds for yourself before watching the DVD. I know you are supposed to be guessing what the birds are than check the answers; but, it just doesn't work for me. I won't be buying any Brown Bag Production DVD's anymore.",1164067200,5,786,4.1103896103896105
