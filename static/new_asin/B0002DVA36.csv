2080905,5,B0002DVA36,When my kids were little they absolutely loved watching the Donut Man DVD's.  We have all of the DVD's and highly recommend them to people who like good clean christian songs/shows for their kids.  Good biblical lessons and songs. My kids are now teenagers and they still love the Donut Man.  I can't wait till I have grandchildren to spoil with the DVD's,1360713600,,355,4.603174603174603
2080906,5,B0002DVA36,"Thought provoking entertainment for children. The Donut Man videos are congruent with Biblical truth and I appreciate how they build character in children. If you are looking for fun and entertaining Christian videos for kids, these are the best!",1346976000,,246,5.333333333333333
2080907,5,B0002DVA36,"I grew up listening to and watching the Donut Man. When I had my own children, I was really sad to learn my mother had given away these to a family member that did not take care of them. My kids ask to watch it at least every other day. My favorite part is hearing them sing the songs from the movie in the car, the grocery store, the playground, and around my home. It is encouraging to know they are taking it in.",1320278400,,415,3.9523809523809526
2080908,5,B0002DVA36,"For the past one year, my son has been asking to watch this DVD over and over again. The lyrics are beautiful, the music is fun. Most portantly, the messages given has taught my son that Jesus Christ, our saviour is very kind to us, and that we need to be like Him and show His love to the world. I think this is the most important message that my 2 years old son will take as he grows up. I have decided to collect all of Donut Man's DVD series. God bless!",1263513600,7,457,3.924731182795699

2080911,3,B0002DVA36,"I bought this DVD expecting a chocolate donut with pink sprinkles.  I didn't get that.  That alone lowers the score two points.  When I buy a DVD with the word donut in the title, I expect a donut.",1103414400,,197,4.131578947368421

2080914,5,B0002DVA36,"I am a 27 year old mother to my 3 year old princess. I searched for Donut Man DVDs for my daughter, as I use to watch them as a child (VHS format obviously). The conversion from VHS to DVD was great. I noticed no difference in quality at all. This video has super catchy songs and dance movements to keep your little one engaged! I want my little girl to grow up learning about how amazing our Savior is, not only at church, but at home as well. We have so many books. Though, I want God's Word to be spread and absorbed using multiple age-appropriate forms. I can't express enough how satisfied I am with the Donut Man series. We love to get up and praise God during the songs! The information in each DVD is presented very age-appropriately using multiple learning styles (Kinesthetic-movement; Visual-kids, props, animals, and of course Duncan; Auditory- songs and discussions). I would definitely recommend these DVDs to any believing family with children!",1449100800,,960,4.686390532544379

Anyway, the cost on Amazon is so much less, compared to purchasing them in a Faith-based book/gift store and the BEST reason to get them here is for the GREAT messages, stories and songs which can be passed onto my grandchildren (I still love the stories and songs too).

He used to have them on video when he was a child and so he is enjoying them because he remembers them from when he was young. The DVD's ended up ministering to me too, and I realized that the Donut Man actually teaches some very deep Biblical concepts an stories not just, ""Jesus loves me this I know.""  That's why it ends up teaching and ministering to me as well. Thanks Mr. Donut Man!",1394841600,3,479,4.150537634408602
