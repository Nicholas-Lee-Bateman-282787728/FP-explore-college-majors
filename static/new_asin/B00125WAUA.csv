8244035,5,B00125WAUA,Awesome. One of the last athletes with no back lash or hidden issues or drama. All American athlete who loved the game and his fans as it should be. One of the last that stayed dedicated to one team for his entire career which is unheard of today.,1522368000,,247,4.166666666666667

8244041,5,B00125WAUA,"Even though the film showed otherwise, my mom thinks she ""discovered"" Derek Jeter, so naturally she loved this story and the interviews.  It was well constructed and the viewer can move easily from one area to another.",1311724800,2,218,4.891891891891892

8244043,4,B00125WAUA,"at about $15...this isn't a horrible deal or DVD...but I was expecting more.  The SPORTSCENTURY feature is only a bit over 20 minutes (most others I've seen are about 50 minutes so that was the biggest dissapointment.  The collection  of interviews over the years is nice to have but pretty bland and not to be visited too often...and the bonus interviews with family members etc...barely tolerable for one  viewing much less repeats.  The featurettes on  the catch out of the field and the flip are good but I seem to have them on every Yankee DVD I have so they aren't new.  Bottom line..
its about  20-30 minutes of stuff worth having  and  new mixed in  with another hour and a half of fluff , filler and rehash.  I would recommend to Jeter fanatics but  others would be far better off getting the Yankeeography volume he's on...Its a better , far better production  and comes with several others for about  the price of this.",1208217600,12,930,4.585365853658536
