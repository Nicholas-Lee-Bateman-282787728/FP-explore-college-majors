6464701,3,B00L4IDS4W,"Nothing special about this movie. Worst $50 spent in going to see a 3 hour stick fest. I give the movie 3 three stars:

Positives

Awesome effects, visuals, and sound.
Explosions..explosions!!!!
Ftw. Dinobots
Optimus prime kicking ass.
Lockdown great villain

Cons

""My face is my warrant"" wth
Galvatron short and pointless tie in
Dinobots show up at the end... Screw you slow burn.
Why is Kelsey Grammer killing autobots? I have robots but I team up with them....
Marky mark is an inventor and past due on his house for 6 months. Are you kidding me?
The creator is who? Just say Unicron already. Damn
Stanley tucci story line. Lame and racist.
How long do I have to listen to imagine dragons in this film?
Magnets really. Let's drop transformers in the air like 7 times and cause destruction,",1404777600,5,793,4.683453237410072
6464702,5,B00L4IDS4W,it seem like these people didn't like the movie wit all the bad comments on here.... but hey who give a s*** wat they think:) im still buying the collection set... transformers is a good movie and lots of action pack on there im not complaining...,1404777600,15,247,4.391304347826087
6464703,5,B00L4IDS4W,"I saw this on opening day and let me just say........best Transformers movie ever!!!!!!!. i was a little disappointed when they said they were pretty much going to start over from scratch with a new cast and new story (i really love shia labeouf""s character and hope they can find a way to bring him back) but i am a huge Mark Wahlberg fan so i didn't think anything of it. i was pretty happy that the love story was put on the back burner and the main focus was on family. i hear people complain about Micheal Bay being the director and always bash him and his style...... i absolutely love that he has directed all of these movies and can't see him leaving or any one filling his shoes, he must be doing something right if this film has already made $575,646,000........ i really enjoyed the way the dinobots were introduced and it's pretty obvious  this won't be the last time we see them....... i thought the movie wasn't long enough and hope they are this long or longer in the future",1404604800,7,989,4.375
6464704,3,B00L4IDS4W,"Overall it was ok.  Lots of loopholes in the plot.  Since when could Optimus Prime fly? The dinobots aren't really explained and only show up at the end.  Galvatron really didn't do anything except show up.  There was never really a ""wow"" moment for me.  That being said I'm glad I went to this and will be buying the blu-ray when it releases.",1404518400,9,343,4.380952380952381

6464708,5,B00L4IDS4W,"This collector's box set cost about $80 when it was first released. I recently snagged it for $25.00, I believe at its lowest price point ever. I enjoyed Age of Extinction as much as any Bay Transformers movies, but the star of this package is the resin statue. It's probably one of the best looking collector's figure I've come across in a while; nice features and detailed paint job. As another reviewer mentioned, overall it's not scaled nor anatomically accurate, but the details more than make up for it. At first, I thought the statue was two-piece as another reviewer indicated a missing sword from Optimus' hand, but this is not the case. It is a one piece statue with hard resin plastic making up the base and Grimlock and a more rubbery material making up Optimus Prime and his sword. Optimus' sword and his hand and arm are one piece, made from a single mold, so I am not sure how that one reviewer received a statue with a missing sword - maybe the statue has been subsequently updated? Overall, it's a great piece at a great price.",1495411200,,1044,4.529100529100529

6464726,5,B00L4IDS4W,"Limited Edition Transformers Grimlock statue with Optimus Prime arrived as described, packaged well, undamaged in perfect condition. Received this item at a great price of only $18.99 and was ecstatic to add this statue to my Transformers collection. The only part that could have been a little better was the paint job, but I'm only keeping it on a wall shelf and the paint is only noticeable if you hold it up to your face. It wouldn't stop me from buying it again at this awesome price. In addition, it came with the Age of Extinction Bluray, DVD, and Ultraviolet copy. I haven't tried the UV code yet, so I don't know if it's expired or not, but honestly it doesn't really matter to me since I purchased this mainly for the statue and that is what I'm happy about with this purchase. Any questions, ask and I will get back to you and try to help out. Have a great day!",1482883200,,872,4.388888888888889

Unfortunately shipping to South Africa bumped the price up by another 13 dollars or so but even then it was well worth it.

I don't understand how people are complaining about this when it is absolutely fantastic and for only approx 24 bucks.

Had this special boxed edition not been on sale for a VERY brief time at a ""too good to pass up"" price (since I collect dragons) then I would not even consider it.
Figure is impressive and though I suggest a little fragile ( it's a plastic statue, not a toy), well weighted and sturdily made. A very handsome figure.
I think I gave the movie to my kids to play Frisbee with.

6464785,1,B00L4IDS4W,"Let's be real, the only reason for this is the ""limited edition"" statue, and that's what I'm reviewing. So to open the box and find the statue incomplete is unacceptable.

On mine, the sword is missing. Not broken off, not fallen off in the box -- just not there. That pretty much leaves Optimus Prime goofy-looking, what with the empty hand and all.

As a casual fan I'd probably have given a complete version 4 stars. As long as you're not expecting museum-quality build or materials, and you can get it on sale, it seems like a cool little display.

But missing a major feature like the sword -- right out of the box -- renders any ""collectible"" nature pointless.

I'd take a replacement, or even just a sword (since the hand is intact I could probably repair it), but since it's a gift that's past Amazon's return cutoff, seems I might be stuck with an incomplete version.

I bought this boxset, not because I am a fan of the Transformers movie series, but because I am a collector of movie boxsets. This is a really nice made set for a single movie collection. The statue looks amazing and displays really nicely. The only reason I did not give this set a 5 star rating is because I would of liked to have seen the disc placed inside the statue itself somehow, as having the generic casing and a statue separate almost makes them feel like two separate items.

6464810,1,B00L4IDS4W,This is the biggest disappointment in dvd ollectors history. The statue is awful. It's size is very small and unproportional and there is no detail on Optimus.not worth the money at all. Just buy the blu ray/dvd and call it a day.,1439856000,,230,4.5

6464819,3,B00L4IDS4W,"I purchased for $29.99 and I thought it is reasonable so purchased this Limited Edition.
 Movie itself,
well it is Michael Bay movie so lot of SLOW motion and Explosion as you will see in the last trilogy.
From my POV movie is 2 and half star, first expression was what a long story! you could make it lot shorter to make it enjoy... but I like action movies so enjoyed watching it as one of Michael Bay's Transformers.
Lot of Action, Slow mo, Explosion, and you like robot fighting than this movie will be good for you.
Also you don't have to watch last trilogy to understand human and transformer relationship so you will immediately can jump in to this movie for action.
If you like traditional cartoon Transformer fan than you will not like this movie since it is way off from the traditional cartoon.

Figure itself
For $29.99, Understandable and can accept the quality. But If I have to pay $119.00 than I will be very disappointed.
Grimlock painting was done ok, some of the painting is miss or over painted but you can tell the face and eye from close and far view so I like it.
As for Optimas Prim, just one word, horrible, maybe I got is this horrible but the painting of the Optimas Prim is very poor quality and I was disappointed when I saw his face.  Face just painted with silver and no eye(Light blue) or mask( should be blue) is not painted and really disappoint me when I saw this ( Come on! Face is most important parts you will be concern in these kind of product!)

Overall: If I am paying $29.99 than I am happy , it is good deal if you look at it since Movie itself cost $19.99 and you are paying $10 extra for the figuring. I will recommend if you want to buy this limited edition, buy it between $29.99-$35.99.",1437609600,4,1735,4.3128834355828225

6464824,5,B00L4IDS4W,"A lot of people don't enjoy the Transformers movies by Bay but I actually enjoy them for what they are. Action movies with a ton of awesome looking robots battling it out. My review isn't based on the movie though.

The collectors edition I bought with the statue of Prime riding on Grimlocks back is pretty awesome. I saw this a while back but just didn't pull the trigger on it. Recently it came up for sale for a price I couldn't pass up and I am glad I didn't. This statue is awesome. It does have a slight issue with scale as Optimus is a lot bigger on the statue than he is compared to Grimlock in the movie but honestly who cares. It looks cool sitting on your desk and if your kids are a fan than they would love it.",1435708800,,724,4.062937062937063

The figure itself is the reason i purchase this product... One great collection for TF fans especially Grimlock, very detail in his Dino Mode as expected for good quality non-transformable figure..
Only one thing not so perfect from the figure --> Optimus Head is very small compared to his body..",1434499200,,451,4.857142857142857

6464861,5,B00L4IDS4W,"This fourth installment of the Transformer motion picture franchise was one of my favorites, ranking a close 2nd to the first Transformer movie!! I grew up with the original animated series and now my son is into the new series and motion pictures. This movie was poorly rated by the critics and ranked as the worst of the four movies, which I really don't understand because I thought it was by far better than the second (Revenge of the Fallen) and most definitely better than the third (Dark side of the moon). Mark Wahlberg rarely fails to deliver, and i just loved the dynamic between his character and his daughter. I thought all the characters were well scripted. As a fan of the originals, I enjoy how the movies continue to pull various plots from the animated series. However, as with all the movies, the action sequences are a little drawn out for me, but well worth it to show off the special effects used to transform autobots, decepticons and now dinobots! The dinobots were exceptional, which is why I purchased the collectors edition to capture the scene with Optimus Prime and Grimlock. It was well worth it and I hope the reviews don't spoil another sequel in the making!",1422403200,2,1189,4.666666666666667
6464862,5,B00L4IDS4W,cool looking collectible great movie,1422316800,,36,6.4
6464863,3,B00L4IDS4W,"I'm really torn on how to rate this....

The movie was horrible. Really, really, horrible. It makes the other movies look like masterpieces. The writing was deplorable, I'm still confused as to why the autobots were suddenly acting like 8 year old twits, and I swear that girl (I'm not going to bother to look up her name) was only hired for her ability to scream. Honestly, the only reasons to watch this thing is for the action and explosions (I like me some explosions), and the dinobots, and let's face it, there wasn't nearly enough dinobots. Honestly, the actors did a decent job with what they had to work with, but the plot, dialog, and characters didn't give them any room to shine. If I was rating the movie alone, I'd give it 1 1/2, possibly 2 if I'm feeling generous, stars.

The figure is fanfreakingtastic! The paint job is wonderful, the size is nice, and it looks great. I grew up loving both dinosaurs and transformers, and you have no idea how tickled I am to have Optimus with Grimlock sitting on my desk at work. I don't care how old I am (I grew up watching the original cartoon, so that should date me somewhat), I am one proud girl when I show this bad boy off at the office. The figure gets 4 or 5 stars in my book.

I've split my rating down the middle between the disaster of a movie and excitement of Grimlock on my desk and given it 3 stars. This was on sale for under $30 when I bought it, thankfully.",1421971200,,1430,4.288888888888889
6464864,5,B00L4IDS4W,"Very nice set! Grimlock looks amazing and of course the movie is good! The statue is a decent weight and feels very sturdy.

6464872,3,B00L4IDS4W,"The movie isn't that great. If you like a series of cool action scenes, it's not bad, but otherwise there's not much else to it and is more style over substance. That said the statue is decent. Nice paint applications and looks good up close, but it surprised me how light it was. Don't expect a polystone or resin type, but it's a good sturdy plastic otherwise.

Movie gets a 1-star for me, Statue gets closer to a 3 than a 4 star, so this is splitting the difference. For $30, the statue is more or less worth it.",1420675200,,515,4.202020202020202
6464873,3,B00L4IDS4W,"1. Paint job on Optimus could've been more detailed.

4. It's a good deal if you bought it on sale for $30.
5. Where's Grimlock's tongue?
6. The scale between Grimlock and Optimus Prime isn't that accurate.
7. Grimlock's tail is the worst part overall... looks like it was finished with a candle

6464903,5,B00L4IDS4W,"The figurine of Grimlock and Optimus is very beautiful and bigger then I expected. I loved it. I do have a question though ? Why has to cost this only 30 dollars in the USA and 100 dollars in Germany and the Netherlands ??? And beware: the blu-ray is only the 2D version. But I have to admit, I bought this just for the figurine. The film is loud, big and over the top and that's the way I like it. You don't buy a Transformer film for the great story. It's just mindless fun. By the way, I did buy the 3D version of this film in Holland and although it is great, the constant changing of the format between 2.40 and 1.85 (IMAX ?) is irritating. I actually prefer the 2D version, which is in 2.40 all the time.",1418774400,,710,4.042553191489362

I have no problems with the scale as, based on my experience with the characters outside of the movies, Grimlock is not that huge relative to Prime. For $30 I can't complain. It's better than the movie.",1417564800,,362,4.671875

6464990,4,B00L4IDS4W,"The detail on the figure is very nice. Optimus is a tad bigger than he was in the film, but the size difference is understandable. While the figure is solid, the base is a hollow light plastic, which worries me to how stable it might be. The shield wobbles a bit if touched, but if it were to fall off it could easily be fixed. The packaging was nice and the DVD was in perfect condition. If I had a friend or family member who was a transformers fan, I would definitely buy again as a gift",1417478400,,490,4.061855670103093

6465001,4,B00L4IDS4W,"Despite the fact that I really enjoyed this movie I know it is bad, therefore my rating is only based on the statue.
When I recieved my package it was actually missing the Bluray (which has since been resolved by amazon) but I mainly was just after the statue.
Like many others I agree Grimlock is of higher quality than Optimus. Whilst Optimus and Grimlock both have a lot of details on them, the paintjob on Optimus is not as good as it is on Grimlock, however this is probably due to Optimus being smaller (and thus harder to paint) and having more colours (it is the red and blue parts that are quite shoddy). However when the statue is on display it looks pretty damn cool and you don't really notice the bad paintjob unless you are getting up close and personal.

I would not recommend paying close to $100 for this set unless you really really want the statue but I would be be willing to pay up to $30 for the statue alone.",1416873600,,931,4.2897727272727275

The statue itself isn't super big, and honestly was a bit smaller than I anticipated, but overall it's really nice looking! The sculpt is beautiful and highly detailed with great paint applications! Optimus Prime looks fantastic with his sword drawn, and this is probably the ONLY piece of merchandise I've seen for this film that really captures the look they gave to Grimlock in this film.

6465032,5,B00L4IDS4W,"I will start out with the movie and say it wasn't really my favorite of the series so far. I thought the acting was bad beside Mark Walhberg character. The movie was confusing and just didn't really build enough on the new autobots. The Dinobots were awesome but wish they had more screen time. I do have to give them credit for the special effects. Overall I rate the move 6 out of 10. It's good for a one time watch or maybe two.

Now to the Statue the real reason why I bought this collector edition. I saw a lot of negative review from other customer and found them to not be as accurate. First yes the statue is small but what can you expect for the price amazon selling it for. I think Slideshow version is going for $1800 and yes it way better in every way. I got my for 30 dollars so yeah it worth it. Grimlock is detail and the paint is very nice. Optimus Prime paint job is very nice in my opinion do to the fact that it look just like the movie with his battle damage. I think people expected him to be shiny and vivid in color like he was a new semi- I think the battle version stay true to the movie. I think it give him more personally and the sword and shield was a plus.

Overall I am a happy customer and for 30 dollars it's a steal",1415318400,,1249,3.992

6465063,3,B00L4IDS4W,"This review is also mainly for the statue.

You know them bottle toppers they sell in cinemas for certain movies that has little figurines on it that looks good but painted sort of arbitrarily? That's the same quality you get with the Optimus color and material-wise. He has a shield and a sword, funny thing is that the shield is propped on a peg on his forearm but the same peg can also be found on the sword wielding one.

Not so for Grimlock. The color is way more varied and interesting though sculpt-wise the detailing seem to have been lost in the molding process and therefore it's somewhat lacking in some points. But the color itself makes the whole thing look nice on your desk, as long as you don't look at it close up. The material is somewhat the same as the aforementioned bottle toppers. In some places pretty hard, in others, like small limbs and that, they are pretty bendy. So no worries of breakage there. But paint won't be able to withstand much force though. I expect it to flake off sometime in the near future.

Does NOT worth the money. Only buy this if you really want it in your collection or when it goes on sale.",1413417600,2,1142,4.377358490566038

I got this set because of the collectible only. All I can say Grimlock is nice and Optimus is a disaster, like the movie. They really got to put more effort into the quality (material) of Optimus and paint job. However the set looks nice from a distance but not really that fantastic close up due to Optimus.

Conclusion: Still a nice piece for display with other Transformers pieces.",1413244800,,522,4.602150537634409
6465067,3,B00L4IDS4W,"I loved the movie.

That said, I bought this for the statue. Made of 3 grades of plastic? Optimus being made up of the softer kind you may see in some model kits, with the base is harder. Grimlock is the hardiest resin? bit. Guess that's what makes it surprisingly light.

It's a nice figure to display, if your not too nit-picky of it not being of sturdier stuff, finer paint job or if justifies the cost....",1413244800,,409,4.298701298701299

1) The first bit of the review is the movie:
I think it is pure awesomeness!!!! I really enjoyed watching it in the cinema, I love the dinobots and that leaves me on to my second bit of the review.

2) The second bit of my review is the statue:
The reason why I ordered this is to get the statue which I think is just magnificent however I live in New Zealand so the exchange rate made it a bit more expensive to buy but I couldn't do without it, it's a must have to any Transformers fan out there. :)

I'm so happy to have such a well-detailed statue of one of them.  Hound is my favorite character in this movie, but Grimlock is just under him.  I stopped buying the toys after Sentinel Prime, but I wanted a Dinobot SOOO bad.  I was originally going to buy either the voyager or leader class Grimlock to display, but I'm glad I didn't.  This statue beats both by a mile.",1412640000,,512,4.28125

Statue comes in a 2 piece plastic shell with the Blu Ray off in a compartment to the side. The Blu Ray is not 3D, for those who are curious about that. Once opened the piece is very light and made from some form of plastic resin. It's proportions are a little off from what I would've expected from a movie accurate sculpt but for the price, one can't really ask for a museum quality piece. The statue has some flimsy areas, such as Optimus' arms, I'm afraid if there is too much pressure or if it's mishandled I might break a piece of it off. Grimlock looks great, it's paint job is near perfect with some minor imperfections. Optimus is painted using a matte blue as opposed to a metallic blue and has issues with a lot of paint bleed. It's face is extremely lackluster and kind of a disappointment but not too big a worry if it's displayed afar.

Overall I think it looks great despite the paint flaws and it's definitely a great piece for people who want a sculpt of Optimus Prime riding Grimlock and will tide serious collectors over until the Prime 1 piece is released.",1412035200,63,1284,4.368200836820083

So excited.  Was going to order this...now in hopes that maybe,  just maybe I'll win his signature.

if not... too expensive",1409875200,7,148,4.518518518518518
6465111,4,B00L4IDS4W,"I enjoyed watching this movie with my 2 boys.  Folks in the theater calibrated their expectation accordingly also for the matinee we attended as we were all prone to cheers and everyone applauded at the end for the closing credits (I may have started that ;-)  I feel the 1st movie was a great scifi movie and this new movie had me at the word ""dinobots"".  This early preview is to counterbalance all the haters as this product hasn't come out but man if the mini statue looks as nice in person as in the pictures then we're in for a real treat.  We have the movie poster with this image on my son's wall and we have the movie 4 toys (deluxes, voyagers, leaders, and dino constructobots) which we love.  If you want Academy caliber movie making then screen American Hustle again.  If you want batsh$% crazy bots on dinobot CGI action then TF4 all the way baby.  (If you want the best of both script & CGI plus a killer soundtrack then I give you this late summer's Guardians of the Galaxy).  I'll update this post after I get product in hand.

6465112,5,B00L4IDS4W,love the sculpt but they failed on tail detail in the spiked nature of the Dinobots.  The proportions are wrong because Prime is 1.5 times his actual size.  This model seems taken from one of the early test artist renderings.  And IMAX is only on 3 D version.,1409184000,,259,4.354166666666667

Price and Quality (or Performance) is pretty cool . The Dinosaur is really amazing . The Material and details are fine but ; Optimus Prime ? It's rubbish. I asked myself  a couple of times ; Why they put like this poor OptimusPrime figure on Dinosaur ? I told you before , Price & Quality is almost equal with it .
