3594828,5,B001G1L3MQ,"If you're a fan of Eric Johnson, you need to own this DVD.  Eric is clearly ""on"" during this inspired performance.  It is the perfect compliment to the Austin City Limits DVD.  The sound quality is first rate as is the mix.  Camera angles give you plenty of great views of Eric's flying fingers.  The only complaint I have is that the show is not longer.",1227139200,,354,4.303030303030303
3594829,2,B001G1L3MQ,"I'm going to give this two stars instead of one because Eric Johnson is an incredible guitar player and I'd even watch an Eric Johnson concert in black & white.

The camera work is pathetic. Also this was intended as a home video  release, so why was it shot in 2:35:1? Concerts are shot in 1:85 or 1:78. Not only does the camera work suck but the quality also sucks. I realize that this DVD probably wasn't given the same buget as say The Foo Fighters BluRay or The Police Certified but the Jeff Beck DVD that just came out blows this away.

I've seen Eric Johnson probably a half dozen times in concert and he's never played for less than 2 hours. So why is this DVD only about an hour of music?

The standards have gone way up for what a concert DVD or concert BluRay should look like and this falls way short of expectations.",1239235200,8,829,4.227848101265823
3594830,5,B001G1L3MQ,"I started playing guitar over forty years ago, so my appreciation of other musicians comes not only from enjoying what I hear but from an understanding of the complex subtleties involved in outstanding musical performances.  In ""Anaheim Live"", Eric Johnson brilliantly demonstrates yet once again, why he is a master of his craft and is well-deserving of every accolade he receives.  Every fan of E.J. should immediately add this dvd to his or her collection.  I will watch it again and again and again...",1235779200,2,505,4.988095238095238
3594831,4,B001G1L3MQ,Loved the video and it never gets old seeing EJ wail on his guitar.  Highly recommend the video...only complaint...TOO SHORT!,1234656000,,125,5.25

3594833,4,B001G1L3MQ,Eric Johnson live in Anaheim is a nice video if you could not be at the show. I bought the new Jeff Beck CD 'Appearing this week at Ronnie Scotts' at the same time. As astounding as EJ is he sounds like a child next to Mr. Beck. I liked Eric's Austin City Limits DVD better.,1231632000,6,274,3.9107142857142856
3594834,4,B001G1L3MQ,"As a lifetime player (starting in the 60's), Eric blew me away with ""Tones"" and ""Ah Via Musicom"".  I've also seen him live a few times so it was with anticipation of a great find when I was alerted to this most recent DVD.  I enjoyed it and still see Eric as one of the great guitar players but the performance was a little disappointing.  Or maybe it was just that it was him covering all the songs I know well?  Familiarity breeds contempt??  I was struck one more time at how multi-talented Eric is... there are some songs where he just plays piano and they were impressive.  Nonetheless, I just bought out the Andy Timmons store <grin> and was hoping for something fresh, new, and exciting and it wasn't there.",1230681600,,714,4.412213740458015
3594835,4,B001G1L3MQ,"hi,
enjoyed this dvd performance was very good and EJ seemed very relaxed in front of the audience,i was disappointed about the length and the production values.having said that i am glad we get some EJ on dvd,he is a rare breed of musician in today's overly commercial music scene! regards map47",1228262400,,296,4.711538461538462
3594836,4,B001G1L3MQ,"It was with anticipation that i opened my copy of Anaheim today. His performance is engaging and spirited throughout and his interaction with the audience has improved since the '88 recorded ACL
DVD.  However, what is lacking is the superior camera work we saw on the
ACL DVD....in fact, it's not even close!!  For some reason, there are even
shots from the very back of the venue(or out in the street) so far away
that you can barely make out the band/EJ.  When closeups come and you finally get to see Eric at work, we are thrust throughout the venue front
to back to side...etc.  At times, it distracts excessively from Eric performace and that should not happen. I personally prefer his setup and sound from ACL to his current setup and Cliffs of Dover on a Gibson SG sounds at times hurried and out of tune(horrors).  Still, he is my favorite artist...but there are much better performances that he has done(ACL in particular)that could/should be tapped into for their artistry and quality.",1228262400,14,995,4.728323699421965
3594837,5,B001G1L3MQ,"The tone king has given me another opportunity to listen to and watch his technique, frame by frame.  Eric Johnson's Anaheim DVD captures both and I love slap harmonics!  Camera angles gave me a close up view I can't see from the rail and shots of Tommy Taylor's drumming and Chris Maresh's bass added even more excitement.  But it's the music that will captivate you as it did me.  Buy it for Rocktapus alone as you may not hear it live as often as you will like.",1227830400,,464,4.2988505747126435
3594838,3,B001G1L3MQ,"Love Eric but there's something missing from this production. Maybe I was expecting too much but this show is under an hour and the ""acoustic"" performances include Eric on piano.
Granted the Austin City Limits DVD is roughly an hour but I'll grab it for my Eric fix.",1227398400,5,266,4.5625
8303600,2,B001G1L3MQ,"Big fan of EJ, disappointed in the quality of this video. 4:3 aspect ratio. Audio is good, video is noisy / digitized, over compressed. Wasn't expecting blue ray quality, but seriously, clay face? Had the original on a dvr for years from the HD net televised show. HD Net should have released this with EJ's approval, it was flawless. This is like a crappy youtube video. I'll keep for the musical value.",1495756800,,404,4.625
8303601,5,B001G1L3MQ,"Eric is brilliant, as usual. A joy to watch his mastery, technique, and range.",1422403200,,78,4.642857142857143

8303604,5,B001G1L3MQ,"Another brilliant performance by Eric . Great job on the cover tunes by Dylan , Hendrix and the Monkees . The acoustic sampler at the end of the DVD was a NICE addition as it features Eric playing piano on 2 of the songs .
This DVD shows just another side of this truly AMAZING performer ! I've seen Eric play live 4 times and I can't wait for # 5 .",1282953600,2,349,3.861111111111111
8303605,5,B001G1L3MQ,"This is Eric's best live performance (purchase the video). Absolutely outstanding and he is playing with a confidence that I have not seen before. The interview section was quite revealing regarding why he seems to be at peace with his playing at this point in his life.
Must buy. Enjoy.

8303606,3,B001G1L3MQ,"I love EJ's big 3 releases: Tones, Ah Via Musicom, and Venus Isle.  Also have others but nothing has ever equaled those three, including what I've recorded of him playing on TV over the years.  He's been one of my fav electric players for years, partly because it's hard for me to play like him (why try, right?!).
This disc is OK but lacks much excitment.......kinda ""ho, hum"" to watch.  Nice that he's interviewed but he rambles too much as though he's tired or can't quite think of anything very significant to say.
One way the disc might have been more interesting was if Eric (or someone) revealed, and it could be just a voiceover in post production, exactly what equipment he is going through on each song.
I hope someday Eric releases another CD in the vein of those great three with some singable numbers and some great straight ahead, but not bluesy or jazzy, rock guitar.",1246752000,,882,4.569620253164557
8303607,4,B001G1L3MQ,"It's nice to see Eric becoming more comfortable with the mantle of guitar hero and finding more joy in his incredible gift.  This is a stylistically varied set that really shows off his guitar mastery.  His rosewood strat sounds beautiful and impossibly thick and creamy; Tommy Taylor and in particular Chris Maresh sound amazing as well.

After reading some of the reviews here I was afraid that this would look like a home video...I think the picture quality is fine and the camera work is not distracting to me either. I was pleasantly surprised.

The acoustic piano set is of interest to me because it's a side of EJ that I haven't seen before.  Been a fan since '84 and it's nice to see someone you're so familiar with in a new light.  I really enjoyed 'Wind Cries Mary' on the piano...very cool.

The second solo on 'Rocktopus' is another revelation only found on this DVD.  Fluid wide-interval scale work and lyrical liquid arpeggios take me 20,000 leagues down in EJ's stratocaster 'Nautilus'. Wicked awesome.

On a personal level, it feels good to see someone you've come to know and admire enjoying themselves.  It pleases me to see Mr. Johnson enjoying the friuts of his obvious hard labors.  This guy is one of the greats of all time and this captures a great performance by him and his band...what's not to like?",1244851200,2,1325,4.668103448275862
8303608,4,B001G1L3MQ,Anaheim Live is a concert DVD that shows how detail and complex Eric Johnson guitar playing is. The DVD is a masterclass for guitar aficionados who are eager to see in great detail Johnson's guitar work and rig.,1241049600,,211,4.578947368421052
