3694026,4,B001M9ELV2,"This will reverse your pre-conditioned beliefs about who is the bad guy and who is the good.
Wearing my PC hat, this is an anti-ableist film.  Instead of joining the millions of films that make the disabled look bad, this film has a mentally-challenged man as its hero.  Disability rights advocates may want to spread the word on this film.
Politics aside, this film is incredibly sexy.  It has female and male nudity, back and front.  It takes place in a taboo environment.  I would love for US filmmakers to make films like this and be inspired by this Spanish example.
I rented this film on a fluke and had a serendipitous experience!",1255737600,88,637,4.601769911504425
3694027,5,B001M9ELV2,"Actor Eduardo Noriega plays a fantastic dual role as twin brothers,one
a policeman the other mentaly disturbed,who fall in love with the same prostitute. I found it very entertaining . Flora Martines as always is beautiful and plays an excelent roll as the twin brothers lover.
A bit tragic at the end. I highly recomend this movie.",1238976000,33,332,4.842105263157895
3694028,5,B001M9ELV2,"After watching this movie I was surprised with the great quality of films produced original in spanish. The movie is well directed, all the elements perfectly match with the plot. Eduardo Noriega and Flora Martinez give an exceptional performance. Great story line with a surprised ending. A must see!",1236643200,28,301,5.163265306122449
3694039,3,B001M9ELV2,"For a movie set in a brothel, there wasn't much nudity - some, but not a lot despite plenty of opportunities.  Some of the other reviews would lead you to believe there is a lot more than there actually is. A disappointment.",1375142400,3,224,4.333333333333333
3694040,5,B001M9ELV2,"I loved this movie two great actors, the ending was like WOW! the tough cop ends up falling for the prostitute like his twin brother did..  Sex scenes are not offensive and in my opinion were perfectly fitted in the movie.  My friends and family enjoyed watching this movie since the beginning.",1368489600,,294,4.634615384615385
3694041,5,B001M9ELV2,This movie is excellent movie enjoy but you need a strong stomic to watch so be a wear of the movie it is very sexuality not for kids at all do not bring kids only adults you need a good head to focus enjoy no girl friend recommended  enjoy if girls watch it remember its only a movie not real life .,1367712000,,300,3.838709677419355
3694042,4,B001M9ELV2,I enjoyed the movie.  The scenery and characters were very good to me.  I would have enjoyed a little more nudity though.,1356739200,,121,4.454545454545454
3694043,4,B001M9ELV2,"Curiously, in some reviews I read in a Spanish film website, most people give this a thumbs-down. I live in Spain and speak Spanish, and generally avoid films made-in-Spain, because they are usually depressing (or silly). This film is a minor gem, very daring in its subject matter, and with interesting actors. Flora Martinez is great, and the rest of the ladies are very well ""fleshed out,"" but it is the fascinating performance by Eduardo Noriega that really stands out for me... performances, really, because he brings to life two drastically different brothers, as described in other posts here. You'll want to see the ""making-of"" too. This shows how the director, Vicente Aranda, uses his presumably limited budget in a totally professional and imaginative way. This is a director worth seeking out (Juana la Loca / Mad Love, Lovers... because he treads where no other serious director dares, and, finally,  makes you care even about the totally amoral anti-hero.",1317168000,2,969,5.09433962264151
3694044,2,B001M9ELV2,"The two actresses are good. The movie has been done sooo many times that I had a hard time staying awake. No story line that hasn't been rehashed a zillion times. there were a few moments of comedy between the girls and cat fight (probably stunt doubles). If it were made in English, instead of the subtitles it would have been much easier to follow. No T+A, a couple of teaser moments, but the only nudity was a man (for goodness sake, ugh).",1315612800,,442,4.337349397590361
3694045,5,B001M9ELV2,"The central protagonist is a policeman. He injures two motorcyclists who are harassing two Muslim women and a child. It transpires that the attackers have powerful parents, connected to ETA; the Basque separatist group; one money-making venture turning out to be sex clubs. The policeman is sent on unpaid leave, pending an investigation into his `intervention' and for his own safety. He goes home. The poignancy in this film is that the first thing he wants to do on arrival is to see his brother Valentin. It's poignant because he is ""a mental retard"" according to his embittered father. In current language, he might be classified as a highly functioning ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) sufferer. He finds his brother, doing menial tasks, in a sex club! This is only scene setting. It weaves in three strands of tension; Raul's love for his brother, ETA's hunt for the policeman and Lolita's Club! For anyone who copes with a disability in the close or distant family, this is a film to watch, just for that. The sex is good too but that's secondary to the love that motivates Raul's behaviour. It is a beautifully constructed film.",1300406400,5,1137,4.865979381443299
3694046,1,B001M9ELV2,"I bought this movie based on the number of positive reviews but by the end I was wondering if we had seen the same movie.  Sure there's nudity, but sexy??  Not even close.  Its like watching a late night Cinemax movie.  And the plot?  Its like 2 bad movies put together with a very weak attempt to piece it together at the end.  Don't waste your time and money.",1295481600,2,361,4.159420289855072
3694047,4,B001M9ELV2,"This is a pretty good movie.  Set in Spain, Eduardo Noriega plays dual roles as identical twin brothers, Raul, a tough guy cop on suspension, his life in disarray and his identical twin Valentin, a mentally challenged, but very nice who guy works at a strip club/whorehouse as an errand boy in their hometown.  Valentin is in love with Milena, a hard-bitten prostitute from Colombia who works in the club and is played by Flora Martinez.  Milena, deeply in debt to the mafia, is into heroin (snorts it) and is clearly on the downside of her career in the sex trade.  Despite all that, she's still beautiful and very popular with the clientele of the club.  In addition, she actually loves Valentin who treats her with great tenderness.

Raul is thinking about a scheme to expose the sex trade mafia in Spain -- who he's in trouble with --  and returns home to serve out his suspension and gather information about the local strip club. He finds out his brother works there and is appalled that he's in love with a prostitute, despite his mental condition and dedication to his job as a cook and errand boy.

There's more, of course, but why give it away here?

Noriega and Martinez give very solid performances.  I was impressed with Martinez in ""Rosario Tijeras,"" and she shines in her role in this film.  Martinez has the ability to add great complexity to her character and she doesn't hold back in this film.  She's a beautiful, talented actress who deserves roles that could elevate her career to a high level.  Noriega showed that he's a very versatile actor, playing two very different characters in the same film.  His tough guy role had menace, ruthlessness and presence and his nice guy role required sensitivity and nuance.  The supporting cast is very good as well.  I think the story was credible and the director, Vicente Aranda, did a good job with it.

There's plenty of sex and occasional gunplay in this film, which due to the nature of the film is to be expected.  If you're a fan of either Flora Martinez or Eduardo Noriega, you won't be disappointed.  Definitely worth a look if you like this type of film.  Four Stars.",1269734400,18,2140,4.625994694960212
3694048,3,B001M9ELV2,"the movie is good, but it is a definetely a guy kind of movie.  you can check your brain at the door.  the person  i bought it from did an awesome job getting me/my husband the dvd, timely, and not scratched.  but over all i wasn't too keen about watching strippers all night but my husband and his friends give it 5 stars :)  just to let you guys now.",1268611200,10,352,3.9714285714285715
