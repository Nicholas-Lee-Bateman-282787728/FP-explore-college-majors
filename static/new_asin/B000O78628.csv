2792385,5,B000O78628,"I held off buying this one for a long time.  Mistake!  This DVD is phenomenal.  The band is phemonenal.  Ditto the arrangements.  I actually had the DVD on my table for over a week...from the moment I put it on, I was in rapture!  Greg indeed has not been in this fine form in years.  He sounded tired and raspy during the ELP tours of the 90's...not on this performance.  These renditions of classic ELP and King Crimson material  are stunning.  The audio is superb, as is the camerawork.  Greg's voice is better than I've heard it since the eighties.

And no, I'm not just one more rabid ELP fan gazing through rose-colored glasses...I don't award a five-star rating to much of anything!  I can't wait to burn the audio of this show to a CD-R.  Greg also displays a humble outlook as he shares between songs.  Very refreshing on a concert DVD.  The arrangement of Take a Pebble includes an astonishing guitar solo from one of his band members.  If there's an ""uninteresting"" track on this disc, it would have to be Pictures at an Exhibition, simply because the arrangement is virtually identical to the studio version ELP did back in the early 90's.  It's still a strong performance, too; I had merely gotten ""spoiled"" by the fresh twists in the other classic material.

Having also seen footage of Keith Emerson's band from 2006, I'd say he and Greg Lake are performing better with the ""fresh blood"" of new musicians inspiring them.  Stop pining away, waiting for an ELP reunion that probably won't happen  ( and ask youself if you truly want to see the musical equivalent of Kirk, Spock and McCoy ""on deck"" in their sixties! )...this is about as good as it gets.",1231718400,8,1666,4.5608108108108105
2792386,3,B000O78628,"I don't understand this concert.  How can three critically important members of the band not have the songs memorized?  Did no one notice the drummer, bassist and keyboardist reading sheet music for the songs?  Did Greg Lake actually have the lyrics in front of him on computer monitors?  For the keyboardist and ""Music Director"" (?) to have to sight-read the keyboard parts is unacceptable.  Who came up with the idea of taking studio session players on the road?

That major complaint out of the way, the rest of the concert is enjoyable.  The lead guitarist is quite talented and the addition of backup singers made the songs sound much fuller.  I wouldn't say that any of the tracks were ""rockin""; it was pretty toned down.

Greg's voice is pretty good, definately more mature, but he pulls it off well.  The camera work was pretty good and the quality of the shoot (lighting/stage/sound) was excellent.

So in summary, I think the concert would've been better as a CD.  I just lost a lot of respect for the band as I watched them play from sheet music.  I would've felt cheated if I saw it in person.",1200787200,3,1105,4.605128205128205
2792387,4,B000O78628,"good sound - dts, 5.1
realy good band (difficult mision the replacement of keith and carl);
still can't go to 5 stars (let's keep it for historical events such as the real ELP live )
...and i would have liked to see more king krimson stuff (my favorite in this concert in 21th century...)
buy it
you won't think is lost money and time",1188691200,11,334,4.234375
2792388,4,B000O78628,"At some point when I was in high school I declared that if I could have the voice of any rock singer in the world, then I would want to sing like Greg Lake.  Now, I probably would prefer to be able to play every keyboard in the world like Keith Emerson and I might have to flip a coin if the choice was between having Greg Lake's voice or being able to sing a phrase like Frank Sinatra, but ever since the first time I heard ""Lucky Man"" I have really liked the sound of this guy's voice.  I am not alone in that regard and there are Greg Lake fans who go back to before Emerson, Lake and Palmer when he was the lead singer for King Crimson, which explains why ""In the Court of the Crimson King"" is the opening track in the concert on the first disc of ""Greg Lake: Live in Concert.""

I was rather surprised that most of the songs in the concert are from the ELP days including ""From the Beginning"" (just once I would love to see Lake start that song on the guitar and launch into ""Roundabout"" instead), ""Touch and Go"" (Okay, that is an Emerson Lake and Powell song, but two out of three ain't bad), a version of ""Take a Pebble"" that takes advantage of Florian Opahle on acoustic guitar, ""I Believe in Father Christmas,"" ""Farewell to Arms,"" ""Fanfare for the Common Man,"" ""Footprints in the Snow,"" ""Lucky Man,"" ""Pictures at an Exhibition,"" and ""Karn Evil 9 (1st Impression - Part 2)"" for the encore.  I was even more surprised that ""Lucky Man"" was really the only ballad that Lake sang (he tells the story of how it became the last addition to ELP's debut album), because I was expecting to hear more songs like ""Still...You Turn Me On"" and some of the tracks from his side of ELP's ""Works: Volume 1.""  I should add that ""The Sage"" part of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" would count as being a ballad.  But the only song from his solo career in the concert is ""Love You Too Much"" and there is a second King Crimson track with ""21st Century Schizoid Man.""  The concert is enjoyable and while Lake is losing power on his upper register there are plenty of moments in many of these songs where he does not have to go that high and I remember why his was the voice I coveted most in my youth.

The second disc starts off with what would be called ""Greg Lake: Live in Rehearsal,"" which consists of a half-dozen full length tracks from the pre-tour rehearsals (all performed on disc 1 except for one of the aforementioned missing ballads) mixed with backstage footage and interviews with band members and others associated with the tour.  A short documentary on ""The Band"" has more interviews with the members, who explain how they came to be in Greg Lake's band (there is a nice bit where David Arch, who plays keyboards and is the group's musical director, explains how they did not intend to go the whole Keith Emerson route with lots of keyboards but could not avoid picking up an organ, a moog, a couple of more keyboards and eventually a second keyboard player).  The final treat is a live performance of ""I Believe in Father Christmas"" performed live at St. Bride's Church on London's Fleet Street.  Lake plays one of the two acoustic guitars accompanied by a keyboard player, the church's choir and Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson on flute.  The sound is not perfect (I have trouble understanding the minister's introduction), but fan's will still be enthralled.  Too bad they did not also do Anderson's ""Christmas Song,"" because that is my second favorite ""prog-rock"" Christmas song.  But three versions of Lake's Christmas song on two discs is a pretty sweet.deal, especially this far out from the Holiday season.",1182470400,21,3606,4.485496183206107
2792389,5,B000O78628,Wish I was there. This band rocks! Greg Lake hasn't sounded this good since the Brain Salad Surgery days. Some of the best sound and filming of a rock concert I've seen in a long time. Pictures at an Exhibition sounds better than original. A must buy for ELP fans.,1181433600,17,264,4.3
2792390,5,B000O78628,"The DVD set states on the back it is for regions 2,3,4,5 which means you can only view it on a computer or need a DVD system that handles regions other than 1. While the concert was great on computer, this item is too expensive to not have a region 1 surround version which means I had to return mine. At this point neither this set nor the 1 disc Behind Stage DVD is available in region 1, so beware until it comes out. At least Mike Oldfield DVDs state region 2 which will not work and now we know region unknown was made over in europe. A region 1 DVD set would be worth getting since the concert was very full rich sound with keyboards unlike the Carl Palmer DVD which only had bass/guitar.",1155600000,14,694,4.148148148148148
2792391,5,B000O78628,"I could go on and on. But i won't. Just Buy The Disc!!!, you will not regret it. First of all. I'ts a 2 disc set. #1 is the concert. 14 songs listed and 1 more song not listed. The production and sound are stunning. #2 is a rehearsal, backstage, interviews, a church performance with Greg Lake and Ian Anderson,and more. This isn't your typical ""behind the scenes Featurette"". It's about an hour long, and I'm not sure which disc is better. They are that good.

I couldn't say how many dvd's I own that I watched once. I've watched this 3 times the past month. I'm of the era when ELP and King Crimson came on the music scene. Greg Lake always had a great voice. And now, well actually 2005 when this concert was performed, Greg still has the voice. It's not the Greg from 1969. But his voice is lower, of course mature, in tune, strong, and he sings with a heart that I don't hear in his early recordings.",1354492800,,906,4.236994219653179
2792392,5,B000O78628,"This DVD set is fantastic. Greg Lake put together a great band (a young, great band), and they all learned to rock out Greg's songs. Althought he is older in this, and a little chubby, his singing voice is still beautiful, and powerful. The first DVD (of the concert) is great. But the second DVD, with the rehearsals, is much better. The videos of the Greg and co. rehearsing are the best versions of the songs, imho.
  There is one thing that these DVDs prove beyond a shadow of a doubt- Greg Lake doesn't need Keith Emerson to have an incredible career in music. He doesn't need Emerson at all. It is very interesting to hear Floria's guitar interpretations of Keith Emerson's keyboard work. His way of playing these songs is refreshing, a definite rock interpretation. The keyboardwork of this band is completely different from Emerson's, but sounds great. Yes, ELP did excellent originals, and, in some cses, are better than the music of this package. But Greg and co. breathe new life into them.
  BUY THIS. I'm not kidding...",1347408000,2,1032,4.716666666666667
2792393,4,B000O78628,"This is usually a pretty cheap disk. The video production value is pretty non-flashy. Simple stand and deliver stuff. No background video crap or odd camera angles. No glitz. No long drawn out stories about how it all happened. His voice isn't as polished as it once was, or maybe that was just the production style used at that time. But the music...! Ah, the music.... It's worth it just to watch the guitarist. The kid is excellent! Anyway, I didn't pay much for the DVD and I really enjoyed it. Made for a nice evening's entertainment.",1310947200,,539,4.56701030927835
2792394,5,B000O78628,"This is a great package. Not only does Greg have his voice back, but he's picked accomplished and talented musicians for his band. There are plenty of extras and each musician gets to speak about the experience and their backgrounds. Well worth the price for any Greg fan.",1304812800,,272,4.6875
2792395,5,B000O78628,There is NOTHINg more that he could have done to make his musical pont.....a great  voice and a pretty fine lead guitar accompanyment!,1300665600,,134,4.826086956521739
2792396,5,B000O78628,"Young, talented band surrounds seasoned master (Greg Lake) and offer a fresh sound to some great classic prog rock!
Highlights- Fanfare For The Common Man, Pictures at an Exhibition (better than the original), 21st Century Schizoid Man....
Decent sound and video quality. Buy it. Great addition to the video library.",1300233600,,316,5.34
2792397,3,B000O78628,"Well if you think of the end of a great artist, whose fame with ELP was interrupted by a dramatic accident which occurred to Keith Emerson in the period of ""In the Hot seat"" (to one of his hands as you know...), you won't believe that Greg has been able to create a new ensemble after a long tormented passage of his career, by touring all over Europe!! Of course the lead guitarist along with him is able to re- arrange ""Take a Pebble"" in a remarkable manner, even though for instance their version of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" doesn't add anything new in comparison to the ELP version of the early nineties...but even Greg is involved into some excursions at the electric guitar and well supported by a good keyboard-player such as David Arch, so at the end- by excluding the tepid ballads like ""Farewell to Arms"" (except perhaps on the magic atmosphere of ""I Believe in Father Christmas"") or a useless blues rock entitled ""Paper Blood""- the other tracks- also in the present video concert- are quite remarkable! Greg's voice is not bad, being so mature, even though not clear at all in some circumstances, never mind cause I've appreciated the choice of ""Karn Evil 9"" and also the ever green ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" so much, after all!!
So you'll forgive him as for some missing powerful ballads like ""Still you turn me on!"" or the solemn and imposing tune ""Jerusalem"", but his return on stage as a well supported ""soloist"" of the prog-related genre has been a true surprise during the year 2005, then becoming a fine ""confirmation"" in the following year, by means of the present live.

Very interesting product and almost a must-have (final evaluation: almost ""4 stars"", cause the tepid ballads prevent me to give this DVD-live a major score).",1279411200,3,1753,4.710097719869707
2792398,5,B000O78628,"Having read some of the other reviews I did not expect what this DVD had. Lake managed to perform some fantastic versions of many of the songs he is known for. "" Court Of The Crimson King "" was fantastic, especially as I had never seen a live version. He also did the best version of  ""21st Century Schitzoid Man"" I've ever seen or heard, much better that even the original. My only criticism is that the kid on lead guitar tended to get a bit too dramatic & predictable with his posing & hair tossing about; two of Lake's classic guitar leads: ""From The Begining"" & "" Lucky Man "" were both overplayed. But otherwise, this was an unexpected great concert & I wish it had even more!",1273104000,,681,4.27906976744186
2792399,5,B000O78628,"I am a ELP fan since the very early days. I followed them through the breakups and reunions. In 1998, I saw them for the last time and I felt they were just going through the motions. Their playing and Greg's singing, in particular,were not the quality that I expected of them. However, with Keith's recent comback album and this great dvd, I am now saddened that because of Keith's hand troubles, they won't be touring, perhaps ever again. As to this album---- suprising because Greg's voice is stronger then ever.( dvd is from his 2005 tour)His band is exceptional. The songs he chose were extremely good. (From his years with King Crimson, ELP and his solo work. Specifically because he chose many songs that ELP probably would not have performed had they reunited including ""Footprints in the Snow"", ""Farewell to Arms"" and ""I love You to much"". All and all, an excellently performed concert by all. Greg, when are you going to tour again?",1256169600,,942,4.715151515151515

8183733,5,B000O78628,"Excellent concert. Greg's voice was aged, but dead on. Top notch band, and set list covered his career very well. Backstage video was also very good. My only complaint is, it isn't four hours long.",1494979200,,197,4.6571428571428575
8183734,5,B000O78628,"With Greg Lake's passing in November, 2016, my hubby was glad to have this gift as a reminder of Lake's great music. The live performances made this an extra special reminder of the memories from the days when we were all younger.",1487894400,,230,4.5

8183738,5,B000O78628,"If you believe that a person can make, create, his own good fortune, 'luck' if you will, then by all measures Greg Lake is King.  Forget the ""he's too old"" or the ""his voice doesn't hold up"" critics, there is plenty to enjoy throughout this video.  Is he an old man?  Most certainly.  Does his voice sound like it did when he originally wrote and sang some of these songs?  No, it does not.  But when you put everything into context, his career, his tours, the bands he as started/joined, etc., this is the most logical place for him to end up.  Perhaps Greg is a cat who has used up 6 or 7 or maybe even 8 of his lives, but what he brings to the show in this video is remarkably pure.  Fancy editing and studio overdubbing might have produced a 'better' video, but it would not be a display of Greg's talent.  What you get here is very real.

This is an excellent video from start to finish.  Greg isn't the grand showman, there isn't a lot of flash or fanfare, but there is a very real, very true, very honest career on display.  To the person reading this, it is obvious that you have an interest in Greg and for that reason alone I would encourage you to 'take the plunge' and get this video.",1368403200,4,1196,4.17467248908297
8183739,5,B000O78628,"This is an excellent, well-refined concert.  The musicians are top-notch and Greg Lake is a legendary performer.  I will be buying this video again for a friend!",1364601600,,161,4.925925925925926
8183740,3,B000O78628,"Each member of Emerson, Lake and Palmer have done a tour and a live CD or DVD in solo with songs from ELP. This time Greg Lake played in 2005, some ELP's classics, plus some King Crimson's songs with his band. Those versions are pretty close to the original, except ""Take a Pebble"" who has been rearranged. There is some mellow tracks that are not as intense as the most progressive tracks, including a Christmas song that seems to have been included here by some fans requests. There is also a rock 'n 'roll song that is too much for my taste, called ""Love you too much"".

This is a very honest performance by talented musicians, with the beautiful voice of Greg Lake. On the second disk, we have 45 minutes of songs in rehearsal with complete songs. The camera work and the picture are very professional, and a nice 5.1 surround sound.",1364342400,,837,4.470588235294118
