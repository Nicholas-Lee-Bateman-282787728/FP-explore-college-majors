3695220,1,B001MBTS8Q,"this isn't a B movie. it's a C movie... or possibly a student film. the only thing that distracted me from the horribly bad acting was the lead actresses' dollar store wig and need of a lip wax.

anyhoo. i think the writing wasn't half bad if the lines would have been spoken by actors with some training, but it just not a good movie. i can only imagine the reviewers that have given 5 stars are associated with the film in some way. there just isn't enough gore, sex or violence to make this movie worth watching, since the rest of the story sucks so bad.",1306281600,2,557,4.205607476635514
3695221,5,B001MBTS8Q,"The only super low-budget movie I've ever seen that was really good was PTU (Police Tactical Unit).  While Alice in Wasteland is not as good as PTU, I really admired how pretty the two lead actresses (Roxanne Sondrup and Michelle Beisner) were.  They'd make nice wives for ANY man.  I'd have a lot trouble trying to pick one of the two.  Michelle is listed as 5'9"" in the movie.  So, in the pair of high heels that she is wearing, she's about 6' tall.  Awesome!",1298073600,2,461,4.364705882352941
3695222,1,B001MBTS8Q,"I rented this film trying out Amazon's VOD rental features. This is a very low
budget crime caper. The acting is terrible. The women are somewhat attractive
in a trailer park sort of way. That is a good thing because most of the action
does take place in a dump of a trailer park. A low budget film can be good if
it has a good story, decent acting, nice action scenes or an abundance of female
nudity. It is too bad that this flick is short on all these things.",1286668800,6,462,4.087912087912088
3695223,5,B001MBTS8Q,"Here's an incredibly entertaining no-budget feature that came out of nowhere! Mixing satirical B-movie conventions with a stylish, revenge-driven plot, Alice in Wasteland is a real trip down the rabbit-hole. After a poorly executed robbery goes predictably bad, trailer-park denizen Alice (Roxane Sondrup) is shot and left for dead, only to wake up from a coma a year later. Now, with a partner she picked up in jail, they're tearing through the streets, and a determined dirty cop (Michelle Beisner, a former Denver Broncos cheerleader) will stop at nothing to retire them. The box compares it to a Carl Hiaasen novel, but I'll go one further and say it's more reminiscent of a great Elmore Leonard yarn. Can't ask for more than that!",1281657600,16,735,4.983739837398374
3695224,1,B001MBTS8Q,"Please don't waste your money.  his movie is a glaring example of money wasted on making a movie.  That being said, if you are a teenage boy or a guy who just wants to see boobs and women in skimpy outfits this might work for you.  But for someone looking for a TRULY GOOD MOVIE DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1275264000,12,308,4.368421052631579
3695225,1,B001MBTS8Q,"I will admit I only watched HALF of this horrid movie before putting it in my ""try to get rid of ""file.  I gave it the good old College try and struggled to finish watching it to the end but after two tries I had to give up before I lost all of my interest to buy another DVD.  The acting was undoubtedly the worst I have ever seen outside a grammar school graduation play.  I am so depressed, and I use to like watching some of these B-movies.",1274313600,6,444,3.966292134831461
3695226,3,B001MBTS8Q,"This is really an pretty bad movie, but it has its clever moments.  The acting hovers around C+ but occasionally bursts up to A.  The dialog is horrible.  Lots of action, and some really funny moments.  The soundtrack is fun and quirky.  It was worth a $0.99 rental, but nothing more.",1273363200,11,284,4.490196078431373
3695227,5,B001MBTS8Q,"A low-budget, never-heard-of indie that rocks!  Basically, I mean you never get to the point where you say, ""oh GOD!"" and shut the movie off out of boredom, disgust or that nails-scratching-on-chalkboard feeling.  Alice in Wasteland entertains, and it does it big-time!  Don't look for story, but DO look for twists and turns, funny stuff and most important - STYLE!  Well, directed, edited fun stuff.  Lighting needs work (probably needs real lights), but I would love to see what these guys do with a real budget.  I demand more!",1230249600,17,531,4.910112359550562
3695228,4,B001MBTS8Q,This movie is good stuff.  It's worth your time and money.  It's funny and it's not over-produced or campy.  The actresses look good too.,1228348800,6,137,4.625
3695229,4,B001MBTS8Q,"This was a great B movie I saw in Colorado Springs.  What I liked most about it was the music by Velvet Rut.  [...]

3695269,4,B001MBTS8Q,"I purchased this movie one night expecting to laugh and make fun of all the bad acting but it turned out to be pretty good,now there were still 1 or 2 bad actors but not from the leads and it looked like they worked with limited resources but overall they did a pretty good job with what they had.",1348272000,4,297,4.0508474576271185
3695281,5,B001MBTS8Q,Awesome ! Awesome ! This movie went way past what I expected. It deserves to go big! Suspense to the MAX! I love you Alice! It was suggested to be a low budget movie but this movie out preformed itself. This movie and the people who made it what it was should all be respected. If you get this movie your getting a box office class movie for less then the price of a hamburger!,1346198400,3,377,4.04
3695282,3,B001MBTS8Q,"This was one quirky little film. It's one of those movies that if you see catch at the right moment if it was playing on TV, you would sit and watch it the rest of the way through. Plot wise, you get the lead character being betrayed and looking for revenge, with plenty of action sequences along the way. There are some over the top moments and the dialogue is (I'm hoping intentionally) cheesey. I guess what I'm saying is that it's bad, but its a fun bad.",1343174400,4,458,4.215909090909091

3695284,5,B001MBTS8Q,Alice in Wasteland is a movie that is worthy to be called a movie for guys who likes movies.  It invokes a little Tarantino (think Kill Bill) It's an entertaining flick - check it out.,1339286400,5,184,4.257142857142857

3695290,5,B001MBTS8Q,"5 Stars? Yes! This crappy flick should be mandatory for watching everywhere where TV installed. Lets start from producers--they clearly have no clue what they doing as nobody teach them. Acting--not connected to anything in particular specifically this flick. Connection to reality--zero-I guess nobody from crew ever visited jail or took time to ask how jail operates. Chicks looks pretty but never show any goodies.
And in general movie perfectly reflect US as a country and how we rapidly descend into unknown wasteland. Perfect!",1324080000,2,532,5.345238095238095

8320841,1,B001MBTS8Q,"Erotic thriller about prison???? Extremely bad so called movie that is as bad as they come. Plot is worthless and totally ridiculous. What prison ? Maybe five minutes in some detention type facility with no value and absolutely no redeeming value. It is a total waste of time and film. Should not be listed as a film for rent at any price. Amazon should pay you to watch it. Thinking of so called women prison movies of the sixties and seventies ? Think again. No resemblance to any of those ""B"" movies in any way. Absolutely nothing to remember except getting ripped off. It goes nowhere, has a weak plot and jumps from place to place with absolutely no semblance of order. If you want to see women being shot by other women have fun but even those poor scenes make no sense and are extremely badly acted.  No graphic anything of any kind to stay in keeping with worthless, scattered plot and nothing of interest for most anyone. Definitely not as described nor even close. Skip altogether if at all possible. Horrific!!!!",1391385600,,1023,4.590163934426229
