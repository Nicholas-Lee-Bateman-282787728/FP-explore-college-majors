3143743,1,B0015D20FO,"Yo nose que pensaba TELEVISA al contratar a Patricia Manterola para protagonista de una Telenovela, con semenjante elenco. Patricia Manterola no save actuar para nada, por esa razon no recomiendo esta novela a nedie.",1392163200,,216,5.382352941176471
3143744,5,B0015D20FO,"Very modern story of sibling rivalry... reminds me of the Bible's Abel and Cain. Two awesome actors and supporting actors are great too. The soundtrack is very romantic. The scenery is beautiful.

There's another movie of sibling rivalry called ""Sortilegio"" but the story is similar and it's still worth watching.",1361059200,,313,5.26
3143745,5,B0015D20FO,"A remake of Tu O Nadie, its not a complete version of the telemundo but you can still follow the story.....",1355788800,,107,4.142857142857143
3143746,3,B0015D20FO,La historia no me logr cautivar. Pero de todas formas al estar tan editada para DVD la telenovela se desenvuelve bien. No se cuanto le habrn cortado de la historia original pero si alguien no la ha visto y le llama la atencin la puede ver pues est muy bien resumida.,1325548800,,266,4.235294117647059
3143747,5,B0015D20FO,"This video is so good, but it is only a condensed version of the total novella and leaves out so much great drama and important scenes..I cry because the love affair portrayed by these two is so genuine..it is as if they are really in love. The chemistry between them is unbelievable.",1275696000,,284,4.480769230769231
3143748,5,B0015D20FO,"I love classic telenovelas, and this one looks like a great cast.  I notice Guillermo Garca Cant is listed, who currently plays the main villain in ""Fuego en la Sangre"" and is doing an entertaining job at it.

(I have bought it, but not watched it yet and with 5 stars am trying to balance the previous commenter, who rated the DVD production rather than the telenovela.)

Give it a chance; it has English subtitles, too.",1214784000,,421,4.5131578947368425
3143749,1,B0015D20FO,"I order this one, thinking it was 12 hours and 2 double disks DVD like it shows in the photo. What I recieved is one that has only one DVD with 5 hours instead of 12 hours. Guess I should have read the details, but it still doesn't explain why the photo of the cover is not the same one I received.

Please see the dicussions in the telenovela community, most telenovelas are 8-12 hours, this is 5 hours. Yes I watched it and there are too many holes for me to even fill-in. I own over 100 telenovelas, there others that have better content and quality.",1211846400,2,553,4.168224299065421

8258050,4,B0015D20FO,I like the product. It was as I expected.,1499558400,,41,3.6666666666666665
8258051,1,B0015D20FO,"It was disappointing.  Although I enjoy watching Saul Lizaso, the plot was weak and boring.  His character was supposed to be that of a very savvy businessman who was aware of the cowardly behavior of his step brother yet he allowed him and a cunning woman to control his actions.  I only watched the first of two cds because I refused to waste my time.
I regret purchasing this item",1470700800,,383,4.442857142857143

8258056,5,B0015D20FO,"Being a fan of telenovela this one was a big interest to me, it has some biblical elements like the able and cain story and a story line about one greedy man tries to steal his brother's fortune by marrying a woman under the name of the rich brother then plan the death of the real rich man and gain the ""widow"" and her fortune.",1420848000,,328,4.061538461538461
