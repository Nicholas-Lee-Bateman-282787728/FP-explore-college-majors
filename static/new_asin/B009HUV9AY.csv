5339446,1,B009HUV9AY,"Amazon! WTF is wrong with you guys over there. I looked at the description and thought, ""Meh, why bother?"" Then I looked at all of the positive reviews and said, ""Well, 1700+ people seem to like it. Let's give it a whirl."" WORST MISTAKE EVER. You've combined this trainwreck of a junior college film class project with a classic WWII movie. I blame myself a bit for not checking more closely. Heck, I even watched it for longer than I should thinking, ""It must be me. I'm not appreciating some sort of artistry that must be there. Maybe it just seems like the story is terrible and the acting is twice as bad."" But, no. I was right all along. A truly craptastic stinker of a movie.",1480291200,36,681,4.3700787401574805

5339448,1,B009HUV9AY,"This description and movie is not the same ""In Harm's Way"" 1965 war movie (which stars John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Patricia Neal and Tom Tryon among others). I was misled by the reviews that were left for the other ""In Harm's Way"" and was excitedly anticipating watching a movie that took place from the perspective of the ships that escaped that bombing at Pearl Harbor in 1941. Whoops! Big Mistake

I wish I could take back the 15 minutes of my life that I took watching this movie. That was all that I could stomach (and that was a lot, considering I would prefer food poisoning over watching any more of the movie). This movie was filled with extremely poor acting, no story and a whole slew of poorly executed technical/set elements that made me look for the closest [high school] student made film to watch, because that is a step up from this movie.

PLEASE do yourself a favor and DON'T CLICK PLAY. Make my 15 minutes of torture worth at least saving you a few minutes of your life moving onto the next movie.

If you are looking for the 1965 version of the movie, you might be disappointed to know that it is not available via Amazon Prime. I searched for it on Amazon and it's available to watch for $3.99 or you can buy the remastered DVD for $4.99 if it's on sale on Amazon.",1479945600,26,1284,4.364016736401673

This film was SO expertly directed to the point that at times I felt as if I were there. IN HARM'S WAY is a taut, riveting thriller that weaves a captivating tale of deceit and betrayal amid a landscape of violence and retribution.

I watched through it because I kept trying to figure out why it had such a high rating (I could have just read a few reviews but have been trying this new thing of trying not to spoil things- although, I tend to love spoilers and now for good reason lol).  The 2012 movie isn't anything to write home about; it was alright.

Markeaur (Brandon Van Vliet) but instead we see a woman agent after them and later a couple of assassin characters they pull out of the blue, bring hired by another guy we really don't know. However, the story centers on Michael (Nathan Tymoshuk) the guy not introduced. He is brought in by Ian (Michael Borka) to be the fall guy for the murder of Markeaur's cousin. There are double crosses with deals and characters we have no ideal who they are either. The plot was not well constructed. The acting wasn't there, with supporting characters being downright ""so bad it is good"" funny. Ryan Kiser has done better. The bad guy lives on his own island and has a party where pretentious faux-famous people sit around and do coke all day. The entire film had that low budget ""fakeness"" to it, like when adult film stars pretend they can actually act and get into a real role. It seemed forced.

 I did like the soundtrack which didn't match up too well with the film.

5339552,1,B009HUV9AY,No self-respecting director would have allowed as stupid a dialog as the one this movie opens with--nor would he have acquiesced to such atrocious acting. 1 star,1480809600,,161,5.0
5339553,1,B009HUV9AY,this is a horribly made movie with worst and unknown actors. the reason for high ratings is bc people seem to confuse this movie with antoher movie with the same name. big NOPE.,1480723200,,177,4.393939393939394
5339554,1,B009HUV9AY,How does someone finance such a terrible movie? This is by far one of the worse movies on any level. Don't waste your time and definitely don't purchase.,1480723200,,153,4.5
5339555,1,B009HUV9AY,"Some of the reviews speak of a WWII movie, I am not sure how that came to be, perhaps another movie of the same name.  Nonetheless, the 2012 version is only one star.  Poor acting, directing, script, etc.  Not worth watching.",1480636800,6,225,4.439024390243903

5339558,1,B009HUV9AY,"Not a good movie. I'm easy to please with some good action, basic plot and marginal acting. This failed on all. I kept hoping it would get better, but never did.

Most reviews seem to mistakenly be for the old John Wayne movie of the same name. This is a completely different movie (not a remake, just same name) and is bad.",1480636800,10,324,4.225806451612903
5339559,2,B009HUV9AY,"Other reviewers thing this was a WWII movie, but it's a poorly-done drug dealer movie with a convoluted plot that's impossible to follow.",1480550400,,137,5.0
5339560,1,B009HUV9AY,Horrible. Bad..........everything. Not the John Wayne war movie. Did I mention it was horrible?,1480550400,5,95,5.857142857142857
8541663,1,B009HUV9AY,"very amateur, beginner film school level",1494547200,,40,5.833333333333333
8541664,1,B009HUV9AY,I ordered the movie in Harms Way with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas and received this one instead. I have not  even watched this one.,1493942400,,131,4.24
8541665,1,B009HUV9AY,This is an all around lousy excuse for a movie. I've seen better movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. No redeeming qualities in the 15 minutes I suffered through. These reviews are no longer mixed with the ones for the John Wayne WWII movie. Thanks to whoever paid attention to the complaint and fixed that.,1492992000,,310,4.654545454545454
8541666,1,B009HUV9AY,"Like others have stated, this movie is not the war movie. This one is terrible in every way.",1492732800,,92,4.166666666666667
8541667,4,B009HUV9AY,"Wow!  I thought this was pretty a good flick.  Multi-faceted story lines that made it VERY interesting.  This is not the WWII flick from the 60s that had the same name, don't be silly and try to judge it by that one.  This one has its own merits.  I recommend it.",1489795200,,263,4.078431372549019
8541668,1,B009HUV9AY,Convoluted and idiotic the meandering plot is nothing more than an orgy of senseless killing. Of course there is terrible acting coupled with a dialogue written by a 3rd grader. To say the movie sucked does a disservice to all those other movies out there that are simply pathetic.,1489708800,,281,4.755102040816326
8541669,1,B009HUV9AY,"HORRIBLE MOVIE. I didn't understand at first how come the movie got 4.2 stars, then I read the reviews were mixed up.

Don't watch, its pathetic, these actors SUCK, like really, worst movie iv ever watched I never review movies but I felt like its my mission to stop this madness.",1489622400,,280,4.490196078431373
8541670,1,B009HUV9AY,This movie was horrible.  I don't know what some people were watching to give it high ratings.  The acting was atrocious and the story line ridiculous.,1489363200,,151,4.769230769230769
8541671,1,B009HUV9AY,omg the acting sucked.......,1489363200,,28,6.25
8541672,1,B009HUV9AY,I got through 30 minutes and I am done.  HORRIBLE movie and acting!!  This is not a good movie at all!!!  I've seen better B movies - this is more like a cheap D movie!  Don't waste your time.,1487894400,,192,3.8461538461538463
