8077573,4,B000AAWO0E,"Funny. English subtitles. In the US you need a region free dvd player.

I first heard of this movie on Reddit. There were gifs of the scene with the guy throwing his pistol up into the air and catching it through the fly of him pants and then shooting up the bad guys from that same vantage point.

The movie is typically Scandinavian but with a smidgen of Rambo/Die Hard tossed in. It will make you laugh.",1376611200,,406,4.259740259740259
8077574,5,B000AAWO0E,"I saw this movie at the Montral Film Festival a while back and remembered laughing so hard, I was crying. I described it to friends as ""the funniest movie I ever saw "". 10 years later, it still funny. Warning : you need to have a DVD player that is multi zone in order to watch it.",1373846400,,281,3.9473684210526314
8077575,4,B000AAWO0E,"Life is easy in the small Swedish town of Hbotraesk, especially for the police. The four officers -- Jacob, Benny, Lasse, and Agneta (Fares Fares, Torkel Petersson, Gran Ragnerstam, Sissela Kyle) -- pass the time eating sausage waffles, playing poker and street hockey, and drinking coffee. One day, a gorgeous blonde from the government, Jessica (Eva Rse), informs them that because there has been no crime in their town, their station will be closed down in three months. The panicked crew realizes they may have to manufacture a crime wave to justify their survival. It starts small -- a little vandalism and grafitti -- but with the help and imagination of the town drunk, Gran (Harry Goldstein), and other friends, our heroes are soon fighting (or at least imagining and reporting) terrorist shootouts and kidnappings.

This delightfully silly 2003 Swedish film includes special effects/quotes from ""The Matrix"" and ""Back to the Future,"" as well as references to Rambo, American Psycho, Die Hard 3 and other American thrillers that particularly appeal to Benny.

I saw this film at the Portland International Film Festival and am sorry it's not apparently available in American DVD format. At the time, there was a rumor that Adam Sandler had bought the rights to make an American version, but it hasn't happened yet, so maybe we're safe.",1209686400,3,1343,5.072398190045249
8077576,5,B000AAWO0E,"I saw this movie at an international film festival in DC.  Even though it's in subtitles, the entire audience howled with laughter.  I mean, literally doubled over.

I'm trying to find it on US-compatible DVD!",1133481600,8,209,4.914285714285715
