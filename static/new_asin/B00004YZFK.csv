7927812,5,B00004YZFK,"This is one of the saturday afternoon movies me and my dad used to watch when i was younger, and it is just as good today as it was then.  Jason Pai Piao stars as a young fighter helping the rebellion against the manchurian forces, when he gets involved further then he ever expected.  One of the greatest villians in martial arts film history.  His weapon, his deadly kung fu and his braided hair.  Killing off all rebells in his path, making way for a deadly showdown with the hero.  A very entertaining film, all out kung fu brawls, and most of all the deadly braid. A must see for any kung fu fan.  One of my all time favorites.",990576000,2,632,4.225
