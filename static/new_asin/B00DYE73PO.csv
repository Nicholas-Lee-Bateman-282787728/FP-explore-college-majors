8599175,1,B00DYE73PO,"This disc is a DVD-R, not a pressed DVD, which means it costs more than it needs to and it is likely to have quality problems.  The producer of the disc was also thoughtful enough to include the original commercials. :(  This is a shame, because the program is wonderful and easily worth five stars. There are terrific extras in the form of episodes from Chicago Stories and other things, including the complete original Walking Tour program.",1487289600,,442,4.7272727272727275

8599181,5,B00DYE73PO,"I live in Chicago and studied architecture. This DVD was produced for our local PBS station in 2011. Yet, it includes every current important building from what was left behind after the Chicago Fire to the Trump Tower with its now-installed controversial Trump name (not visible in 2011). WHY Amazon is pricing it at this outrageous price is beyond me. You can order it on-line from the Chicago History Museum or the Chicago Architecture Foundation for $19.99 plus tax; If you live in Chicago, you can simply walk into the shops and avoid the UPS postage. The photography is truly magnificent; the original airing was during a pledge drive, of course, where they were asking $60 for the DVD. Still, it is the best of the Geoffrey Baer ""tours"" to date. It is certainly NOT a ""rare"" or out of print DVD. It's indispensable for any architecture buff. Once you see it, you'll want to come to Chicago (in the summer).",1403395200,7,913,4.6770186335403725
