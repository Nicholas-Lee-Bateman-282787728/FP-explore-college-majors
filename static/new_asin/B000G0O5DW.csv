8128193,3,B000G0O5DW,"I thought this would be the full episodes that included the Fairy Tale bits - unfortunately, it's only the Fairy Tale bits, so a bit shorter than I was expecting.  Also stated it includes the Little Golden Book of Gerald McBoing Boing, but it is a cheap paper rendition stapled together with a very poor binding and I don't expect it to last long.",1389916800,,347,4.421875
8128194,5,B000G0O5DW,"I remember this from my childhood in the 50's, although some episodes have been updated.  Great mid-century animation and the funny premise of a boy who can't say words, just sounds.  My grand daughter was mesmerized.",1376265600,,217,5.0
