8051500,1,B0007TKOTG,Not a very honest seller. Sent me the wrong dvd thinking I would accept it.  They showed two dvds with same title.  They didn't have the one I requested so they sent me the other with the Three Stooges.  I was able to return it but I had to pay for shipping it back.  So I really lost out.,1383436800,,289,3.847457627118644
