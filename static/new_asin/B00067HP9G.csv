2174142,5,B00067HP9G,"This film is exceptionnal. Not only it was shot in yiddish in Poland four years before Hitler's agression, but also it relates a fantastic story of love beyond life and death, good and evil in a mystic community of religious Jews (hassidim). Eventually, the actors and the scipt are excellent, and the religious songs strongly emphasize the mysticism of the story. It's a real ""chef-d'oeuvre"", an ultimate cry of love in a world condamned to disappear, and the dance of the bride with the death has a prophetic flavour.",1142121600,20,519,4.842696629213483
2174143,4,B00067HP9G,"My rating of four stars reflects the dvd transfer of this movie.  While the movie is a part of film history and itself worthy of five stars, the restoration of the movie leaves a lot to be desired.  The movie is in Yiddish, with English subtitles.  This film being black and white, it is very hard to read the white subtitles.  It would have been easier to read if the subtitles were yellow.

  Channon falls in love with Leah.  Unbeknownst to them, but knownst to us, their parents made a sacred pact that if one fathered a boy and the other a girl, they would be wed.  One father dies and years later, the pact is forgotten about.  I will not give away the rest of the story, but this movie has a lot to do with Kabbalah and numerology, as well as the interesting topic of exorcisms within the Jewish faith.  It also has a character that can dissappear and reappear at will and also communicate with the dead.

2174144,4,B00067HP9G,"""The Dybbuk"" is a 1937 Polish film by Michael Waszynski, more or less loosely based on the eponymous play by S. Ansky. Inspired by apocryphal Jewish myth, it tells the story of a spurned lover who comes back from the dead as a spirit (a dybbuk) to possess the girl he loved. Tremendously stylized acting (that some might see as bad), camp in spite of itself, and very very odd, in the best sense of the word. It speaks volumes about gender.",975024000,6,440,4.378048780487805
2174145,5,B00067HP9G,"Anyone who subtitles has to ask himself such questions as, How long does the viewer need to absorb this or that sentence? And if I give the viewer this much to read at the bottom of the screen, will he be able to react to the film emotionally? Subtitles for this print of The Dybbuk are by the best-known subtitler of the era, the father of subtitling, Herman G. Weinberger, who subtitled any number of Italian, French and German films. If you've seen other films subtitled by him, then you know what to expect.

There's a rule: each subtitle should be onscreen for no less than five seconds. In my own subtitling I've broken it many times--always with trepidation. Consider A Star Fell From Heaven (Ein Stern faellt vom Himmel), with Joseph Schmidt, for which I tried to include translations for nearly every word and put up some titles for as little as 1.75 seconds. All the while I felt as if Weinberger were looking over my shoulder disapprovingly. But then Star Fell is a romantic comedy, whereas The Dybbuk is a monumental, overwhelming tragedy that transcends words. You watch Star Fell with your eyes and ears. You watch The Dybbuk with your soul.

Why didn't Weinberger subtitle the opening ten minutes? He could have done so easily. Presumably he or the producer decided to keep the viewer looking rather than reading. They must have wanted him to absorb the FEEL of the piece. The conceptual content is minimal. What matters is the piety.

Why didn't he or the producer subtitle some of the songs? Presumably they felt that doing so would detract from their emotional content.

Today most opera performances have surtitles--and most people bury themselves in them. The opera fanatic, on the other hand, knows when NOT to look at them. Ignoring subtitles on a film or video screen isn't so easy, however, so Weinberger omitted them selectively. He knew what he was doing. I don't think watching The Dybbuk would be so shattering emotionally had he subtitled everything.

Before transferring the film to DVD, I compared five different film prints and chose the best one. Picture and sound are in surprisingly good condition. If you're old enough to have seen black-and-white films in movie theaters, you've sat through far, far worse. To see a clip from this DVD of The Dybbuk for free visit the Bel Canto Society site.

The film is highly stylized. One of the dance sequences is like a Brueghel painting sprung to life; the living mingle with the dead physically and thus emotionally.

When Caruso heard Sirota sing ""Celeste Ada"" in a concert, he reportedly thanked God the cantor had chosen ""to employ his heavenly gift in a different field."" Sirota, born in Russia in 1874, officiated as cantor in Odessa, Vilna and Warsaw. He made cantorial recordings beginning in 1903. From 1927-35, he sang concerts throughout Europe and in the U.S. He and his family perished in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943. In this film he is heard for a few minutes.

The Dybbuk was filmed on location in Kazimierz, Poland, and in a Warsaw studio in 1937
 --Stefan Zucker

""Kazimierz was historically perfect. It even had a small cemetery. The Jewish population, or almost all of it, had something to do with The Dybbuk, appearing in its mass scenes.""--Leon Liebgold, The Dybbuk's male lead, interviewed in The New York Times, September 10, 1989

""Sirota was one of the most highly trained cantors of all time. His octave leaps, perfect three-note runs up the scale, fabulous trills, facile coloratura, are unrivaled by any other recording tenor.""--Arthur E. Knight, The Record Collector

The Dybbuk is the most widely produced play in the history of Jewish theater. It has been performed in Yiddish, Hebrew, German, Polish, English, Ukranian, Swedish, Bulgarian, Czech, Serbian, French and Japanese.",1329696000,3,3783,4.8845553822152885
2174146,5,B00067HP9G,"Just two years before the Nazis would goosestep across Poland, Poland's Yiddish theatre produced perhaps its finest film classic:  The Dybbyuk or Between Two Worlds (Yid. ''' ''''' ''''' '''''' ''''' '''''', Der dibuk oder tsvishn tsvey veltn).

Based on a 1914 play by S. Ansky, The Dybbuk is the musical story of a young bride possessed by a dybbuk --a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person-- on the eve of her wedding. The Dybbuk is considered a seminal play in the history of Jewish theater, and played an important role in the development of Yiddish theatre and theatre in Israel. The play was based on years of research by S. Ansky, who travelled between Jewish shtetls in Russia and Ukraine, documenting folk beliefs and stories of the Hassidic Jews.

Unlike the theatrical version of The Dybbuk, the film version begins before the main characters -- Hannan and Leah -- are even born when their fathers make a sacred vow that their children will be married.  As part of sealing this vow Hannan's father does a beautiful recitation from The Song of Songs.  In this way, among others, music is very much a part of the telling of this haunting story.

Sadly, Leah's father never learns of the birth of Hannan because Hannan's father tragically dies at sea before even he can witness the birth of his own child.

Later in life, Hannan, now a brilliant talmudic scholar, falls in love with Leah, and even meets her father Sender.  For his part, Sender is unaware that Hannan is actually his dead friend's son and therefore his daughter's marriage match.

Because Sender is a rich merchant he opposes a marriage between the two, as he prefers a rich suitor for his daughter. In desperation, Hannan decides to study the mystical arts of the Kabbalah, in the hopes of finding a way to win back Leah, whom he feels is his predestined bride. When Sender announces that he has found a suitable bridegroom for Leah, Hannan drops dead in a state of mystical ecstasy.

In a significant plot point, Hannan dies appealing to Satan and not God for devine assistance.  In another significant plot development Sender discovers Hannan's true identity, albeit ""too late.""

On the day of her wedding, Leah goes to the graveyard, for the purpose of inviting the spirit of her dead mother to attend the wedding. She stops by the graves of a bride and groom who were murdered together before their marriage was consummated, and invites their spirits to the wedding. Finally she is drawn to the grave of Hannan, and leaves the graveyard appearing somehow ""changed"". Under the wedding canopy, Leah suddenly cries out to her intended: ""You are not my bridegroom!"" and rushes to the grave of the slaughtered bride and groom. A man's voice issues from her mouth, saying ""I have returned to my predestined bride, and I shall not leave her"".

She has been possessed by the Dybbuk.  This possession is graphically demonstrated when Leah litterally dances with Death as part of her wedding festivities.  Viewers aware of what would yet happen to the Polish Jewish community may find this scene particularly poignant and powerful.

Owing to her possession, Leah is brought to the home of a Hassidic sage who is to exorcise the dybbuk from her body. Upon inquiry Sender reveals The Dybbuk/Hannan's identity and the nature of the pact that Sender had made with Hannan's father.

A rabbinical court is convened and the room is prepared.  The spirit of Hannan's father is invited to plead its case from within a chalk circle drawn upon the floor. The court declares that since it cannot be determined whether the children were actually concieved at the point of the pact, it's null and void. The rabbis attempt to appease the spirit and ask that Sender say Kaddish over the spirits of Hannan and his father. But the dybbuk does not acknowledge that it has been appeased. Leah is left within the chalk circle of protection while the others leave to prepare for her wedding. When she is alone, Leah renders her own verdict, leaves the security of that circle and dies, finally joining her Hannan.

Sadly the original play's author, Ansky died on November 8, 1920, and did not live to see the play professionally produced. As a tribute to Ansky, a production of the play was prepared by a troupe of actors from Vilna during the 30-day period of mourning after his death, and on December 9, 1920, the play opened at the Elyseum Theatre in Warsaw. It proved to be the Vilna Troupe's greatest success. A year after the Warsaw premiere the play was produced again by Maurice Schwartz in New York City's Yiddish Art Theatre and several months later the Hebrew translation by H. N. Bialik was staged in Moscow by the Habima Theatre, under the direction of Yevgeny Vakhtangov, a protege of both Stanislavski's and Meyerhold's and director of the experimental ""Studio One"" of the Moscow Art Theatre. At that time, Habima was the Hebrew language unit of the MAT. They later emigrated to Palestine and after Israeli independence, became the state's national theatre. Though the Vachtangov production was finally retired from the company's repertory, the play remains a symbol of Habima. At the same time, it is also a symbol of Yiddish theatre, though, in fact, it is hardly a typical representative of it. The first English production ran in 1925 and 1926 at the off-Broadway Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. This highly regarded production was translated and adapted by Henry G. Alsberg. In 1977, Joseph Chaikin, a central figure in American avant-garde theatre, directed a new translation of The Dybbuk by Mira Rafalowicz, a dramaturg, yiddishist and longtime collaborator of Chaikin's at The Public Theatre. The Royal Shakespeare Company staged Ms. Rafalowicz' translation, directed by Katie Mitchell, in 1992. The most recent UK production was a minimalist, close-focus staging directed by Eve Leigh at The King's Head Theatre in early 2008. Other modern versions include a two-person adaptation by Bruce Myers, a long-time member of Peter Brook's Paris-based company. Mr Myers, who had acted in Joseph Chaikin's production of The Dybbuk, won an Obie when he performed his ""Dybbuk"" in New York in 1979. The two-actor ""Dybbuk"" was produced three times by San Francisco's TJT (The Jewish Theatre San Francisco, formerly Traveling Jewish Theatre)and won several awards.

Besides stories, Ansky also collected traditional melodies, one of which he incorporated into this play. When Aaron Copland attended a performance of the play in New York in 1929, he was struck by this melody and made it the basis of his piano trio Vitebsk, named for the town where Ansky was born.

Of all versions of Ansky's play the most powerful of course is this film. It was directed by Micha' Waszy'ski in Warsaw, starring Lili Liliana as Leah, Leon Liebgold as Hannan (Channon, in the English-language subtitles), and Avrom Morevski as Rabbi Azrael ben Hodos.  In real life Liliana and Liebgold were married and fortunately chose to leave Poland just after filming and significantly in time to avoid the Holocaust.  Perhaps it's their real life marriage that gives their on screen love such power and depth.

What can't be denied though is the haunting quality of this movie, which included many actors who went on to die during the Holocaust along with the community depicted.

2174151,1,B00067HP9G,"For everyone who has enjoyed Parker Tyler's ""Classics of the Foreign Film,"" be aware--this title is completely misrepresented.  It is entirely in Yiddish, contains no subtitles (no menu option), and is sonically garbled.  The liner notes make a great fuss about PCM Audio formats and Lavry engineering--but so what, if you can't understand a line of dialog.

Anyone who watches this film for even five minutes can tell it is a masterpiece.  Unfortunately, the desire for profits has, in the present case, superseded any sense of morality or responsibility. And what a monstrous injustice to the doomed inhabitants of Warsaw who participated in the filming of this great work of art!

I have no idea whether there are decent prints of ""The Dybbuk"" available.  But better nothing than this!  (And even the cheapest public domain issuers have the decency to supply subtitles--this is simply criminal.  Shame on you, Stephen Zucker!  Re-issuing Tauber and Jan Kiepura doesn't give you the right to rip off classic film lovers.)

UPDATE:  After forwarding through the chapters, I find that only the first ten minutes of the film lack subtitles.  After that, subtitles magically appear, although many of the sequences--especially the musical ones--still lack translations, and the subtitles are often impossible to read due to washout.  In addition, the subtitling is cursory and many nuances of characterization are lost, although the plot is at least intelligible.

So, I would rate this a 5-star film with a 1- or 2-star presentation.  I have a feeling this is the best we'll ever get (the film was long believed to be lost), and the audio is badly deteriorated to boot, but Bel Canto must be given credit for at least making the film available, albeit imperfectly.",1202601600,10,1762,5.069444444444445

`The Dybbuk', released in '37 is a cinematic time capsule providing the viewer with a mesmerizing glimpse into a world that no longer exists. While '37 was a long time ago (70 years come 01/07) the film has a feel, no an atmosphere, that seems much older. Filled with magic, superstition and Jewish mysticism, it is a veritable compendium of Yiddish culture, religious practice and belief. While such subject matters will clearly command the attention of a very select audience it is an immensely important film nevertheless.

Synopsis: Two young people, Leah (Lili Liliana) and Channon (Leon Liebgold), fall hopelessly in love but are unable to wed because Leah's Father plans for her to wed a wealthier suitor. Heartbroken, Channon turns from his pious ways and calls upon the ""Powers of Darkness"" to come to his rescue and help him secure his desired bride. Unfortunately Satan isn't in the business of bringing young lovers together to live happily ever after. Only sadness and grief lie ahead.

This is really quite a watch, kind of an Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' meets `Fiddler On The Roof' with a little touch of `The Exorcist' thrown in for good measure. Definitely not for everyone, but if you're in the mood for something totally different and are willing to put in the time and attention to explore the darker teachings of Kabala and Jewish mysticism this will serve as a great primer.",1167350400,21,1443,4.9300411522633745

The adaptation of the stage play necessarily eliminates or pares down many long set-piece speeches, but this allows the filmmakers to take full advantage of the mystical ambiance, and also effectively ""opens out"" the story to encompass the village and directly depict events in the backstory. Black-and-white cinematography and Yiddish script with subtitles, for the average viewer to whom the setting and language are foreign, work to the story's advantage in lending an additional air of otherworldliness to it. (Those who are more used to modern naturalistic acting may be initially put off by the mannered, 'stagey' performances. The performance, though, is not only suited to the material and a valuable preservation of the Yiddish theatre style, it also evokes German expressionistic cinema, and leads one to notice how closely Germanic culture and Jewish culture interacted - far more intimately than the 'kultur' of the Nazis would ever admit.) My one problem was - when I put it in my (admittedly low-cost) DVD player, a dybbuk seized the machine!
