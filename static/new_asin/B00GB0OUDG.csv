6069653,5,B00GB0OUDG,"This movie reminds me of the movie that came out about 10 years ago. A teenager play a game and makes a perfect
score. A few days later a man comes about the game advises the teenager that he was the only one to get a perfect score.
They go for a car ride which turns out to be a space ship and the man turns out to be an alien. The title was the Last star fighter",1393632000,2,364,3.6794871794871793
6069654,1,B00GB0OUDG,Content is a mindless jumble. Well if you like to see high school antics and their drama. NO action till the last 30? maybe 20 minutes and it was more watch a phone activate a metal suit and guns. Looks sort of like some companies first attempt at mixing CGI (only in the very last part.) What a waste. I wonder if amazon will refund my money.,1391817600,5,343,4.134328358208955
6069655,1,B00GB0OUDG,"While the cover illustration is excellent, it reminds me of ALL SUPERHEROES must die, in-as-much-as the contents don't live up to the cover---or preview-trailer for THAT matter. The last 18.6 minutes of the movie was, sorta, average B-movie quality. Nah........nah!

Briefly: Buy The Last Starfighter instead!",1400371200,3,309,5.717391304347826

6069657,1,B00GB0OUDG,"Terrible movie. Giving it 1 star is generous. Bad acting, choppy, poor graphics & little action. The picture on the box looks great.",1398902400,,132,4.782608695652174
6069658,5,B00GB0OUDG,"With some of the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days, it was nice to see someone make a family friendly movie that my kids will actually watch. It appears to be an independent film, but was far better than many recent Hollywood flops I have suffered through. I would like to see more good independent movies like this given the attention they deserve. I had never heard of this movie until I saw it at Costco. It looked like something my sons would like and I was right. The graphics are amazing and the story line and over all messages were good as well. While it is not a big budget Hollywood Blockbuster I found it to be a solid and entertaining movie. I am glad I watched it before I read some of the reviews as I feel much of the criticism is unfair, if you are looking for, or expecting The Avengers, you may be disappointed. Time Warrior reminded me of one of my favorite movies when I was a kid, The Last Star Fighter. I do not want to give away any spoilers, but I think many of us have dreamed of being drawn into our favorite video games. I hope the filmmakers plan to make a sequel as I feel it can be even better than this one.",1398038400,,1147,4.147982062780269
6069659,1,B00GB0OUDG,"""I found this movie on sale for $5 at family video, glad i didn't buy. It is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, the only thing promising is the graphics, and the story, other than that it isn't flat out good. Horrible acting, ok actors, lots of cursing (not for kids), people who loooked like they had died didn't die, and worst of all the ending. I waited for the ending when my dad told me we could watch something else that wasn't garbage. Big mistake, and the ending wasn't good either. That is 2 hours of my life i won't get back,"" this came from my teenage son.",1397865600,7,574,4.133928571428571
6069660,3,B00GB0OUDG,"Interesting story line. Not bad for for a Sci-if independent. Good CGI.
The unknown teen cast is good.
Worth a watch. The Lord of War room
scene is a sick collection of authentic
wepons. Heard over a half million dollars
of real machine guns used for the set!!",1396656000,,260,4.4375
6069661,5,B00GB0OUDG,"Not a Multi-Million dollar, star studded blockbuster but better than many of them I have seen. If you are looking for the next Avengers Movie, this is NOT the movie for you. A friend shared it with me on Facebook and so we decided to give it a try. The story is a good one, and we were glad to find it was kid friendly. I am old enough to remember The 'Last Star Fighter' and this seems to me to follow in a similar tradition. I am hoping the release goes well and we will get to see the next one as well as the ending set itself up for a great sequel. A great movie for video game lovers, and would probably make a great video game concept. Wish more people would support good independent films like this so we can stop being so disappointed with a lot of the terrible movies flowing out of Hollywood these days.",1396396800,,813,4.0875

6069663,1,B00GB0OUDG,"I watched the preview and thought ya my grand kids would like it.  Well it was not a good movie.  Bad acting, stilted actions and a really lame story line.  I would not recommend this to anyone at all! It was so bad I deleted it from my Library.  It was a waste of money, and time.  What can I say except don't buy.",1395273600,8,315,3.859375

8621863,2,B00GB0OUDG,"it has all been said in the previous reviews but here it is....such bad acting (but I do think  that the tall blond kid may have a future if he gets some lessons or good advice) everyone else should not give up their day jobs. this story is a bad version of ""the Last Starfighter"" which was a terrific movie so check that out instead. They tried to make it a little different by giving it a biblical twist....really wrong move and really wrong actor and I use the term loosely.",1408492800,,477,4.241758241758242
