8558931,3,B00AXOJWB6,"Rocky is released from prison for a crime he didn't commit. The action focuses on Rocky trying to track down who framed him and how to get his friend, still in prison, released. This is a routine film noir with with Dick Powell and Rhonda Fleming doing well in their roles, but the film moves slowly and there is not enough action/suspense to make this a standout noir. You can pass on this one without missing much.",1507334400,,416,4.415584415584416
