7634834,4,B01BHCPQEY,"The fifth season follows Dick (Bob Newhart) and Joanna Loudon (Mary Frann) further into their adventures at their colonial Vermont inn, as well as Dick's weekly program at the local TV station.

Self-centered, often ditzy maid Stephanie (Julia Duffy) is still going strong with TV station manager Michael (Peter Scolari). They do have their ups and downs, however, as seen in the two-part ""Desperately Desiring Susan,"" when Michael falls in love with a quiet, intelligent woman completely unlike Stephanie.

There are also more serious moments, as seen in ""Unfriendly Persuasion,"" when caretaker George (Tom Poston) refuses to accept Stephanie's glib disregard of their friendship one more time.

Another memorable episode centers upon Dick and Joanna's ""spontaneous"" roadtrip in ""Fun With Dick and Joanna,"" which leads to a hilariously horrific night.

The amusingly bizarre trio of brothers Larry, Darryl and Darryl (William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss and John Voldstad) is also up to their usual hijinks - in ""Jail, Jail, the Gang's All Here"" they must clear their names after being accused of rustling a neighbor's cow. In ""My Two and Only,"" Larry fights to keep his position as family leader when the brothers meet a new friend.

And of course, there's the usual array of eccentric and wacky townspeople and guests at the inn -- usually coming by just as Dick is busiest with his latest writing project.

Viewers young and old will enjoy this classic sitcom!",1486339200,,1462,5.173728813559322

While the first couple of seasons of Newhart had a couple of characters that were forgettable (just my opinion), when Peter Scolari joined the program, it really took off and flew very well! Larry, Darol and Darrell were just priceless, and the shows were each examples of stellar writing and acting. I'm delighted to see this show become available on DVD!",1471305600,,473,4.925

7634873,3,B01BHCPQEY,"I am a big fan of Bob Newhart in both of his shows.  However, season 5 is a significant step or two down from the prior 4 seasons.  The characters are the same, but the writers seem to have lost their way.  Some of the shows are almost cringe worthy.  The amusing characteristics of the gang in prior seasons have been repeated over and over again and exagerated to the point of them becoming cardboard characters.  How many times do we have to see: ""Hi, I'm Larry and these are my brothers . . . ""  Even Bob spends more time doing one-sided phone conversations, the routines that made him famous as a stand-up comedian.  Buy it to complete your collection, but not for the enjoyment of prior seasons.",1466553600,,701,4.387596899224806

7634882,5,B01BHCPQEY,"We have now entered the second half of Newhart!  Im a huge fan of Bob Newharts 1980s sitcom, which has slowly been hitting DVD.  After a several month gap, Shout Factory has given us season 5, and this season of the sitcom is still filled with great laughs.

In this series, Bob Newhart stars as Dick Loudon.  Along with his wife Joanna (Mary Frann), he runs the Stratford Inn in a Vermont.  They are surrounded by an eclectic group of friends and employees.  There is their handyman George Utley (Tom Poston), a native of the town whose family has been taking care of the Stratford for generations.  Their maid is Stephanie Vanderkellen (Julia Duffy), a spoiled rich girl who has been cut off from her family and has to work for a living.  Michael Harris (Peter Scolari) is Stephanies boyfriend and the producer of Dicks local access TV show at the local station, WPIV.  And next door, running the Minute Man Caf, are Larry, his brother Darryl, and his other brother Darryl (William Sanderson, Tony Papenfuss, and John Voldstad).

Over the course of this season, Dick has a mid-life crisis and follows his dream of becoming a cowboy, Michael has a dream interview with a big TV network, Stephanie starts to worry about her job when an injury forces Dick and Joanna to hire a temporary maid who is actually good at the job, the bell tower that Georges father built needs to be repaired, and Joanna gets angry at Dick for something he did in her dream.  Meanwhile, Michael tries to help Larry win the girl of his dreams, a new friend drives a wedge between Larry and the Darryls, Dick tries to find a place to sleep after a fight with Joanna, and a stuffed animal becomes an issue for everyones Thanksgiving plans.

As you can see, there are plenty of great stories this season.  Weve moved a bit away from stories with guests at the inn and focus on stories with our core cast of characters.  While Larry, Darryl, and Darryl aren't in every single episode, they are in most episodes of the season, and between these eight characters there are plenty of laughs to go around.  Add in some supporting townspeople and employees at the TV station, and its easy to see just how many laughs we can generate from the characters we already know.

And laughs there are.  Oh, we know all these characters at this point, and the writers know all the characters.  Quite often, you know the joke that is coming, and yet they are still so funny you cant help but laugh.

Thats a credit to the very talented cast.  Their chemistry and comedic timing is perfect.  They take the words of the writers and bring them to life perfectly.  This is a case where everything is running perfectly, and we get to reap the benefits.

As the series progressed, the characters began to become more and more caricatures of themselves.  There are hints of that here, especially with Michael, but its not really over the top yet.

Meanwhile, the show was obviously from the 80s, mostly with the fashion.  The comedy is timeless, however, and youll be laughing at the jokes even if the clothes date things.

Season 5 consisted of twenty-four episodes, and all of them are presented here in stereo and full frame.  There are moments in each episode that the picture shows its age, being a little soft, but its not too bad.  There is one episode that comes with a warning about poor quality, and a few scenes of that episode are pretty bad.  However, it is still watchable with plenty of laughs.  There are no extras on the set, but Im just happy to have the episodes.

Whether you are a longtime fan or not, youll be thrilled to have season 5 of Newhart in your collect.  Youll be laughing before you know it as these wonderful characters again entertain.",1465430400,4,3719,4.552710843373494

7634893,2,B01BHCPQEY,"Very disappointingly, the writing in most of the episodes is mostly unfunny, milking the old increasingly tedious comedic cardboard characters and their rather limited shtick. The most irritating recurrence is the vastly too frequent visits of the one note Larry and his mute brothers.  The mind numbingly unfunny, now horrendously repetitive ""hello I'm Larry etc etc"" has worn as thin as any comedic 'theme' ever could.  The Scolari character isn't the tiniest bit funny any more.  The shows just stagnate almost throughout the entire series, with just 4/5 funny episodes out of 24.  Scolari just tries way too hard to be funny with often cringe making, horribly repetitive scenarios. He should have been dropped long ago. Twas a great show in the early years. The series 5 finale was excrutiatingly bad/unfunny.  Such a shame a series as good as this was allowed to wither and atrophy.",1464566400,,887,5.0479452054794525

It isn't. There must also be at least a sixth season. I didn't see the episodes I was expecting such as when we find out about Johnny Carson's connection with Larry and his brother Daryl and his other brother Daryl, and the one where we find out about Daryl and his brother Daryl's secret musical talent, and the last episode where everyone is turning Japanese. Now I suppose I will have to wait another year for the release of Season six. Boo.",1464307200,2,614,4.394736842105263

I would have paid this price just to watch Good-Bye and Good Riddance, Mr. Chips, which was hystericall. Dick takes a typing course and the instructor  (William Windom) turns out to be his former 6th grade teacher.  Evidently Mr. Brooney (aka Looney Brooney) has the mindset that Dick is still 12, and treats him and the entire class as such.  From making them put their heads down on the desk, to having them stay after class resulted in a five minutes of uncontrollable laughter.

7634899,5,B01BHCPQEY,"""Newhart"" is a first class sit-com, developing humor out of everyday situations. The cast and the acting are superb. Season 5 was delightful, as are the previous seasons. The video and audio quality were excellent. Just before one episode, the manufacturer alerted viewers to the fact that the video about to be aired was the best copy available, and it apologized for any audio and video disturbances. The alert was appreciated, and the disturbances that appeared were minor and momentary. Overall, it is an excellent presentation of season 5 of an excellent series. I am eager for season 6 - one of the craziest episodes of the series occurs in season 6, when, on Halloween, residents think the town has been invaded by space aliens. The Mercury Theatre on the Air applauds.",1463097600,11,776,4.886363636363637
7634900,4,B01BHCPQEY,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but I saw something while watching a few episodes that made me write one.  I like that Shout! has tried to get the best sources and tried to present these as unedited, because we all know what happens in Syndication, they chop off 5+ minutes.  The episodes are around 24.5 minutes each.  I was really enjoying the clarity of these, especially since for the last four seasons, they used a different film stock that really makes the show look brighter, really pleasing to the eye.  Also, the character development is in full form here, George the ever forgetful Handman, Michael & Stephanie, Yuppies to the core, and Larry, D & D, who could forget them?

However, I was kind of taken aback when I saw there was some fuzzy (inferior looking footage) cut into the glamorous video.  I also noticed that there was blurring out of a logo at the bottom right hand of the screen.  It was clear that they used bootleg videos (they are all on YouTube, from the Comedy network in Canada) for certain shots.  Last time I sent Shout! a question, they never replied, so I'm not going to bother to ask them, but there must be a reason they had to use this inferior quality video.  I hope if there is season 6 (which is my all time favorite, hands down), they will get better masters or ask me for footage, since my old VHS's from Nick@Nite look better than YouTube footage.  This should in no way detract from the viewing pleasure, in fact I am the worst consumer ever, since I am so critical and tear everything apart.  I doubt anyone else would have noticed this or picked up on what was happening, other than some footage looks fuzzier.",1463011200,16,1655,4.447019867549669
