7852133,1,630362605X,"NIGHTSCARE stars Elizabeth Hurley as Dr. Stephanie Lyle. She works at ""the institute"", where she's been experimenting on a psychopath named Gilmore, to see if his mind can be made normal. Dr. Lyle has been using combinations of chemicals on him in order to change his brain. Unfortunately, these drugs cause some rather dangerous side effects. Simultaneously, for some reason, Lyle's neighbors are winding up dead under peculiar circumstances (hanging, spontaneous combustion). It seems that their each having odd dreams just prior to their demise. Is Gilmore able to enter the minds of others? Is he leaving his cell at night in his dreams, and invading those of his victims? Can this movie get any more ridiculous? The premise of NIGHTSCARE is absurd and disjointed. It tries to be profound, but comes off as mostly cheeeze. It seems as though big chunks of the story are missing, resulting in a confounding viewing experience. All attempts at being nightmarish are more silly than frightening. Weird things happen, and add up to nothing. Gilmore, though repugnant, just isn't menacing. He tries to be a Hannibal Lector / Freddie Kruger hybrid, only to be a bad parody of both. The hard-nosed cop is a cardboard cut-out of a police officer. The creepy nun is idiotic. Alas, if it hadn't been so horrifically dull, it could have been the next TROLL 2! Hurley is a fine actress, but even she has a hard time wading through this visual sludge...",1378339200,,1444,4.8979591836734695
7852134,1,630362605X,"This movie is a complete rip-off of Nightmare on Elm Street. A killer kills people in their dreams. A dream psychologist (Elizebeth Hurley) tries to stop him. The only differance is that this movie isn't scary at all. The plot is impossible to follow, and nothing is explained clearly. The cover art may look interesting (especially with Hurley on it) but it is nothing but a huge mess. Steer clear of this one.",992995200,,411,4.6438356164383565
