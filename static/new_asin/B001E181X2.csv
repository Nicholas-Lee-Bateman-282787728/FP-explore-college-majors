3545144,5,B001E181X2,"Until the Ovation channel pointed it out in the 2011 Christmas season, I never paid much attention to the fact that the Nutcracker, as a story, had various interpretations. Thankfully, I love Tchaikovsky's music. Within a few days, I've seen 6 versions all to the same faithful execution of his music.

It's been a delightful education.  All versions have their strengths and weaknesses, but I will need to get more familiar with each version to more precisely identify what I liked and didn't like. Although, while I appreciated Matthew Bourne's attempt to push the Nutcracker envelope, it came across as a bit mean-spirited to me.

Thankfully Nutcracker - Story of Clara pushed the envelope in an absolutely wonderful direction. It has been the most engaging and satisfying interpretation I've seen.

The span of ages in the dancers, the depth and breadth of the story, how relatable the story is to real life, how well the choreography respected the music all contributed to an extremely enjoyable experience. And with that ending it became Superb! I'm not one to cry, so I didn't, but I came very, very close.",1324771200,2,1113,4.935828877005347
3545145,2,B001E181X2,"This version of the Nutcracker drove us nuts for the first part of it (about 20 min) with old folks dressed in horrid costumes reminiscing about the days when one of them was a prima ballerina.  Then traditionally dressed dancers started coming on the stage, but it was very distracting and muddled. We gave up, turned it off, and donated it to the local library.",1292889600,,363,4.584615384615384
3545146,4,B001E181X2,"New look to an old favorite. Colorful, well danced version of well know story. If you have the traditional version and want something different using the same music, this is it.",1240876800,3,177,4.741935483870968
3545147,5,B001E181X2,"I'll say it again:  Wow!  The previous two reviewers here (Wilinsky, Rawls), I say, are much too mild in their praise (even with five-star reviews).  I own four other ""Nutcracker"" dvd's besides this one (Collier/Dowell, Royal Ballet; Kirkland/Baryshnikov, ABT; Balanchine, NYCB; Kochetkova/Karapetyan, San Francisco Ballet), and in my opinion this one easily eclipses them all.  According to my aesthetic, at least, this Australia Ballet ""Nutcracker"" is another order of magnitude above all the others.
  I needn't go into details of the ballet plot-wise (see other reviewers).  But Graeme Murphy and Kristian Fredrikson:  such a masterpiece! Very original, very creative, very moving.  I'll put this up there with any ""Swan Lake"" or ""Giselle"" there is.  Also wonderful choreographically:  Beautiful pas de deux with original and magnificent lifts, and (remarkable!) lots of actual dancing for people from the quite young to the quite old.  Not a trite moment in the entire ballet.  Stunning and creative use of the ethnic dances from Act II.  (It is now difficult for me to go back to any of the other ""Nutcrackers"" I own, as fine as they are, and feel satisfied.  Don't deprive yourself of this dvd.)",1234310400,12,1202,5.1875
3545148,5,B001E181X2,"I bought this ballet a year ago in a three set package of Tchaikovsky Ballets. When I first viewed it I said, ""I don't like this version of 'The Nutcracker'"". I viewed it again a few days ago and discovered that something was wrong with my brain, it had not seen things correctly. I was completely wrong about what I said to myself. This is a wonderful heart warming story of an aging ballerina and emigre from Russia, living alone under poor circumstances in Australia. Her friends visit her at Christmas time, and they reminisce about the old days when they were all dancers. Colin Peasley, (Dr. Coppelius in the Australian Ballet version of ""Coppelia""), plays the part of one of her old friends.....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Australian-Ballet-Coppelia/dp/B0006A9HV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Australian Ballet - Coppelia</a>.....You simply MUST have their ""Coppelia"". Justine Summers (see below) is in that too, but the star is Lisa Pavane as Swanilda.

The elder Clara (she was 72 when she starred in this production in 1994), overexerts herself and her doctor puts her to bed, and then the ""dream"" begins. Everything from the classical Nutcracker is there, the Christmas tree (does not grow), the Nutcracker, the Mice, the Snowflakes, All the music (a bit out of order), and all the dances. The dream takes her back to her native Russia and her training (it's wonderful how they age her), her graduation, falling in love, and the beginning of her dancing career, her travels, and finally her settling in Australia. There is truth in many of her memories, for ballet did begin in Australia when Russians on tour were stranded in Australia in the early forties at the beginning of WWII.

The elder Clara is played by Margaret Scott (who still looked good in a tutu), the ballerina Clara is played by Vicky Attard, the child Clara is played by Siobhan Elsmann, and her love object (her Doctor) is played by Steven Heathcote. Also in the cast is Justine Summers, who stars with Steven Heathcote in ""Manon"" by the Australian Ballet (Excellent)...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Massenet-Manon-Sir-Kenneth-MacMillan-Royal-Australian-Ballet-Justine-Summers/dp/B000G1ALFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Massenet - Manon / Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Royal Australian Ballet, Justine Summers</a>....Justine is seen in several of the Nutcracker divertissements, and she is so utterly beautiful it is hard to miss her.

Music for this ballet is very good Dolby 2 and surround, filmed in the 3:4 video format, very nice sets and lighting, lots of color, especially in the second act and her training days and travel scenes. The dance of the Snowflakes is superb with a weaving formation slightly detracted from by a close-up, but still beautiful. There is some vintage footage used in this ballet to good effect. Over-all, I think you will enjoy this version of ""The Nutcracker"". ..Something different but not ruined. It's still classical ballet.........Richard.",1231545600,7,3037,5.540948275862069
3545149,5,B001E181X2,"This is a wonderfully fresh ballet utilizing some of the concepts of the Nutcracker, as well as the Nutcracker score, but very different from the usual Nutcracker versions. It is a biographical ballet of an actual Russian ballerina who emigrated to Australia in the 1940's. The story is very sweet and poignant with a surprising ending(I won't give it away!). The choreography is purely classical and very interesting. There are wonderful twists and contrasts. The basic structure is guided by the Nutcracker story, but other than a few actual Nutcracker elements(like mice and snowflakes), it sticks to the biography. The sets and costumes are just great. This is an actual performance in front of an audience and not a studio performance. it seems as though the entire Australian Ballet was used in this performance, including most of the principal dancers as well as the corps de ballet(the ballet was preformed in 1994). The image and sound are first class as well. If you want an outstanding Nutcracker ballet far different from the norm, but still along classical lines, you will appreciate this.",1225411200,12,1102,5.06043956043956
3545150,5,B001E181X2,"I enjoy and replay two of the Australian ballet videos. Their ""Coppelia"" is one and this is the other. It has a new story line which does not resemble the traditional tale, except in being set at Christmas time and making some use of a few old items such as the rats. The new story, set in Australia, makes the heroine into an elderly Russian immigrant. Her Christmas party causes her collapse and she dreams of her past life. Three dancers dance her role, showing her as a girl, a successful ballerina, and an old woman.
There are many technically good performances and many roles are presented with real feeling. The heroine as a young woman in love has some particularly successful choreography. The story, though new, is easy to follow. The video version is well lit and camera angles have been well edited.
I enjoy watching this tape again every year and I would heartily recommend it to anyone prepared to accept a new plot set against the familiar music. If you want a traditional Nutcracker, this isn't one, but it is well worth seeing in its own right. I'd love to see it danced by other companies besides the Australian.",1011744000,12,1130,4.599009900990099

8295916,4,B001E181X2,"Magical ballet. Video quality not the best (shot in 1997) and images seem compressed so everyone is a bit shorter and stockier than they should be, but such a beautiful ballet it didn't matter.",1494288000,,193,4.705882352941177

8295918,5,B001E181X2,This is my favorite version of this ballet. I have recommended it to everyone I know. The story transcends any of the other renditions. The choreography and the  dancers are superb! This is a must see!,1453593600,,201,4.583333333333333
8295919,5,B001E181X2,"Absolutely wonderful. I watched it a few days ago, then watched it again the next night. The new interpretation was brilliant and made much more sense in the modern world than the usual. I found the ending sad, yet fulfilling, and in the last few days have found the story strangely haunting. As a ""senior"" myself, I particularly enjoyed the first half, with the elderly dancers enthusiastically plunging into the joy of the holiday. (Was the vodka in that bottle real?)  Not a story for children, but a terrific one for adults of all ages.",1450915200,,540,4.684210526315789
8295920,3,B001E181X2,"This version is good-I'm glad I saw it; however, parts of it are a little too weird for me... It's hard to improve upon or change a classic like the Nutcracker.  Worth seeing, but I doubt it will be the dvd you pick out to watch again and again...",1403740800,,247,4.040816326530612
8295921,4,B001E181X2,"I saw the Australian ballet on a trip to Sydney and the lady I was sitting next to told me about their non-traditional Nutcracker.  I was thrilled to see it in DVD.  It's definitely different, beautiful choreography but if you are looking for a traditional Nutcracker to show your kids, this is not it.  It has mature themes and is very sad.",1393545600,,341,4.467741935483871
8295922,5,B001E181X2,"i am very much a traditionalist when it comes to the nutcracker, and most attempts at reinterpretation tend to reinforce my desire to return to the familiar.  however.  this nutcracker is brilliantly, profoundly, heart-wrenchingly wonderful.  others have explained the premise and praised the dancing.  i'll add to that the extremely charming and well-executed acting and staging, which result in beautiful moments of uplifting comedy and devastating sorrow.  it is a deft and often subtle exploration of nothing less than life and death, love and loss, the ravage of war and the loss of innocence.  the non-linear approach of telling her story is used to great effect in conveying a rich emotional tapestry.  this emotional impact is further deepened as each clara (student, ballerina, retiree) bumps into her older/younger self.  tears will spring forth...consider yourself warned!

this year my 8 year old daughter (with five years of viewing various nutcrackers to her credit) claimed it as her favorite.  stunning, in a version lacking a sugar plum fairy, a land of sweets, and all the other innumerable child-baiting accessories so often seen in the traditional versions...of which i am a huge fan as well!

i do have one complaint:  they failed to provide tissues in the dvd box, which is really just criminal, because this is a two hour, non-stop tear-jerker.  amazon is on it: people who purchased this item also purchased cases of kleenex facial tissue.",1387756800,,1463,5.174468085106383
