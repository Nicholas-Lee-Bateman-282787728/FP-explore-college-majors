1632553,4,B00005NG05,"Although superficial similarities make it tempting to regard the Hal Roach Studios ten-episode series pilot THE VEIL as a sort of trial run for the later TV series THRILLER (a.k.a. BORIS KARLOFF'S THRILLER), that is really an inaccurate and unfair comparison.  It's true that both shows are hosted by venerable horror star Boris Karloff and that he appears in several of the dramatizations--in fact, he appears in all but one dramatization on THE VEIL--and it's also true that both series deal with the supernatural.  But unlike the stories presented on THRILLER--which are completely fictional horror stories, many based on previously published works by popular horror and science writers of the 1950s and early 1960s such as Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Cornell Woolrich, and the like--the stories on THE VEIL are presented as ""true"" stories about real people who have had a brush with supernatural phenomenon like ghosts, reincarnation, psychic prognostication, and similar spooky irregularities.  But true or not, the stories on THE VEIL are, of course, purely dramatic ""reenactments"" with no scholarly research or backup information provided to the audience, and it is therefore more accurate to see THE VEIL as a precursor to the more contemporary THE X FILES rather than as a dress rehearsal for THRILLER.
That said, THE VEIL is certainly an entertaining anomaly from television's golden era, and its high-quality production values makes one wonder why it wasn't picked up as a regular series.  In fact, the show per se was never broadcast.  However, in the late 1960s, 10 years or so after the original production, blocks of three or four episodes each were hastily stitched together--ironically, much like the Frankenstein monster character that originally made host Boris Karloff a star--and licensed to local TV stations for broadcast as movies on late-night TV.  So this two-disc DVD from Something Weird video is likely the first time THE VEIL has been made available to the general public in the show's original 10-episode format, and Karloff fans, horror fans, fans of THE X FILES, and, yes, even fans of THRILLER should find the show very enjoyable, and most will want to add it to their DVD collections.
Whether due to restoration or just because the source material was rarely used, the picture and sound quality on the DVD set is just fantastic! The liner notes include a synopsis of each episode, as well as some interesting historical background material about the show.  Bonus materials on the discs themselves include a few episodes of 13 DEMON STREET, a foreign-produced TV show in the same vein as THE VEIL and from the same era.  That show was hosted by Lon Chaney, Jr., and the production quality is obviously not as high as that of THE VEIL.  Indeed, the source used for the DVD transfer is washed and sometimes jittery, but the episodes are, if nothing else, interesting for their historical value.
This DVD set is a must-own for Karloff fans and for those who have a strong interest in or love for classic television.  Fans of more contemporary shows like THE X FILES and MILLENNIUM may also enjoy THE VEIL, especially in light of the fact that shows like this are the true progenitors of the modern fare.",1069632000,94,3254,4.99815157116451
1632554,3,B00005NG05,If you love Boris as I do then this set is worth your time and money. It is nowhere near on a level with the Twilight Zone or it's offshoots such as Outer Limits but Boris is Boris and what more needs to be said?,1048291200,5,212,3.7333333333333334
1632555,5,B00005NG05,"If you enjoyed old TV shows such as Thriller (clearly inspired by this show), Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Hitchcock Presents you cannot miss this rare release.

1632557,5,B00005NG05,"I am a HUGE Boris Karloff fan, which is primarily why I purchased this DVD. However, the series on presented in this two disc set is wonderful. The acting is great, the transfer is extremely crisp and, of course, Mr. Karloff is his usual charming self as the host (and actor in most of the vignettes).
The bonus two episodes of 13 Demon Street, hosted by Lon Chaney, Jr., are interesting if not as polished as The Veil.
I am extremely happy with this purchase!",1015804800,13,460,4.423529411764706
1632558,3,B00005NG05,"Something Weird Video scores another mini-triumph (after Monsters Crash the Pajama Party) with this rare and strange collection.  If you're a fan of Boris Karloff, there's no question you must have this 2-disc set.  Karloff is not only the host, but appears in most of the episodes.  Comparisons to The Twilight Zone are inevitable; but the tone of the show more closely resembles Alfred Hitchcock Presents.  The quality of the scripts and acting varies wildly, making the series a mixed bag.  On the technical side, the picture looks crisp and clean, and the audio is acceptable for a mono recording.  A special bonus: 2 episodes of the equally obscure 13 DEMON STREET, hosted by a haggard Lon Chaney Jr.  Personally, I hope SWV will go ahead and release the full Chaney series.  Overally, an impressive presentation of a Lost Not-Quite-Classic.",1001721600,38,846,4.992857142857143

The series purported to dramatize true stories of the unexplained and supernatural. As such, it bore more than a passing resemblence to ""Alcoa Theatre's One Step Beyond,"" down to the creepy theme music. Both series are exceedingly entertaining and are reminders of how much excitement can be generated without cgi, blood, and gore.

1632726,5,B00005NG05,"While ""I' wouldn't earnestly try to describe these ten television episodes as ""scary"" or the like , I did find them fascinating and instructive when I streamed them via Amazon Prime prior to purchasing them . The first episode finds Karloff's police inspector humorous in that the character he portrays is a bit of a buffoon and a nitwit . Subsequent episodes , however ,  revealed a broad and compelling range of characterization by Mr. Karloff , much to my relief . That's swell in and of itself . Factor in the fact that these programs never aired on television , are of generalized very good image and sound quality , are circa 1958 , are well produced , written and acted and are collected in a single two disc set and it's difficult for ""me"" to  come up wanting in any way . No greater resemblance to any program past of present than John Newland's One Step Beyond .",1476921600,,872,4.44375

The show unfortunately was never aired due to studio politics.  Each episode is different. The writing and story lines vary from episode to episode and is a definite must for Karloff fans as he will make an appearance as villain or hero.

It's supposed to be true tales of the supernatural and unexplained, except that you can explain the concluding twist 15 minutes into each episode.  Somehow, Karloff's opening narrations seem to emphasize his gentler side which does not do much to build up suspense for the coming episode.  Not only are the episodes lacking, but the capsule descriptions have been scrambled by Amazon or someone else along the line.  Karloff's intro to the first episode refers to returning to spend another evening ""Behind the veil."" The description does not match the episode for this or any other so far and there doesn't seem to be a pattern.  3 stars seems a bit much, but 2 stars means ""I don't like it.""

These shows are 27 minutes long to allow for 3minutes of ads, in a half-hour time slot. Boris was a master of disguise and is virtually unrecognizable in some of the episodes. The show has an air of reality like ""One Step Beyond"", with the twist ending of ;""Twilight Zone"". Amazon prime streaming has the titles of some episodes mixed up.

1633093,4,B00005NG05,"I first stumbled upon this show when I found a DVD of several of the episodes at a local electronics store. I was captivated by one particular episode, ""Jack the Ripper"", and did some research on the show. Apparently, this was never telecast on TV back in the day - only ten episodes were made before it was cancelled. Apparently there were two other episodes as well, ""The Vestris"" (which supposedly served as the unofficial pilot of the series, which is not found on this compilation), and ""The Gloucester Captain"" which is also not found on this compilation.

The show features 27-mins. long episodes that are stand-alone. In most of them, Boris Karloff, scion of classic horror cinema, introduces the episode, and also appears in them, showcasing his talent for portraying a variety of roles. Various themes are touched upon here: crime, reincarnation, revenge, etc. The quality of the episodes varies from utterly riveting (such as ""Jack the Ripper""), fascinating (""The Return of Madame Vernoy""), to so-so. This 1958 show predates ""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) and there are some similarities. It's too bad it never got picked up because I feel the show is interesting enough and had lots of potential. Luckily for viewers interested in such shows, we have it available for streaming here on Amazon and also on a DVD release by Something Weird Video.",1438819200,5,1352,4.955947136563877

1633267,5,B00005NG05,"As fans of Boris Karloff's Thriller series, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised to discover this rare, and sadly, unaired gem from TV's golden age.  Another reviewer mentioned that The Veil is more of a precursor to the X Files than it is to Thriller, which could be true given that The Veil's stories are ""based in fact"" rather than purely fiction.  But The Veil stands on its own, regardless of comparisons to other series.  The acting ranges from superb to campy, but is always entertaining.  Unlike the longer Thriller episodes, the 25 min. episodes here never drag and reach a conclusion long before one wonders where this is all going.  As a dedicated Karloff fan, it was a pleasure to see his genial approach to the unexplained.  Karloff stars in all but one of the episodes and his performance as a bumbling English constable in ""Vision of Crime"" was worth a chuckle (his assistant, Patrick Macnee (John Steed of The Avengers), can be seen holding back his laughter).  If you like this period of TV horror/mystery series, check it out--you won't find the bizarre and occasionally preachy themes of the Twilight Zone here, but just good retro entertainment.  One warning: for whatever reason, the titles on Amazon Prime do not link to the episodes they're supposed to, so you will have to click through them to find the one you want to see.

1633325,5,B00005NG05,"The series was hosted by Boris Karloff, who also acted in every episode but one, and was allegedly based upon real-life reports of supernatural happenings and the unexplained. Ten of the twelve episodes began and ended with Karloff standing in front of a roaring fireplace and inviting viewers to find out what lies ""behind the veil.""

Hailed by critics as ""the greatest television series never seen"" (according to DVD release publicity) The Veil was never broadcast. Troubles within the studio (and the collapse of a preliminary co-production arrangement with National Telefilm Associates) resulted in production being cancelled after only 10 episodes (an additional episode called ""Jack the Ripper"" had been produced by another studio and was acquired by the Roach Studios; Boris Karloff only introduces the episode). This was considered too few to justify sales to a network or to syndication. In the late 1960s, footage from several episodes was combined to make films that aired on late night television. Ten episodes were released to the public in their entirety for the first time in the 1990s and have subsequently been released on DVD by Something Weird Video. In 1999, ""Lifting the Veil of Mystery,"" a Tom Weaver article on the making of the series (complete with episode guide), appeared in issue #29 of ""Cult Movies"" magazine.

I wish this collection was complete as for many years it was thought that only 10 episodes of The Veil were filmed and thus they appear here. Two extra titles (""The Vestris"" and ""Peggy"") were thought to be ""alternative titles"" but are in fact episodes of the series The Veil. They are not included here. So I am missing 2 episodes. However, in 2008 Timeless Media Group released a 2-DVD set of 12 episodes of The Veil under the title Tales of the Unexplained that included those two and you can get it here on Amazon.com .",1359504000,3,1862,4.926751592356688

glad I did because the quality is excellent and you get a few extra short stories on disc 2 with Lon Chaney. This was a show that never
aired and Karloff even stated he never got paid for doing them. It's a mystery why this show never made it network TV because it was
the first Twilight Zone and better than average mystery shows. With Karloff was host of each episode he even stars in the best ones

Mr. Karloff narrates all the stories and stars in 9 of the 10 features.  He protrays a range of characters, which is a pleasant surprise for his fans. The stories themselves are varied and involve different cutltures, but all reflect the theme of the unexplained.

1633377,5,B00005NG05,"I can't say I was ever much of an outspoken Karloff fan, but will say that this series was an excellent chance for him to show some range in his acting.  The Veil has actually made me a Karloff fan and feel it's a shame he was not in more visible dramatic film roles later in life.

The Veil itself as mentioned on other reviews is indeed a lot like ONE STEP BEYOND, though the production values seem a bit higher and had better directing.  Each episode of The Veil has a feel more akin to a mini-movie due to its directing, cinematography and fine acting.

Each episode, due to these high caliber production values, is very enjoyable to watch. Each story moves along at a fine pace and the music punctuates in just the right places, creating a enjoyably creepy atmosphere.  There are very few special effects and the ones present are pretty simple. I think this demonstrates how the power of suggestion can be far superior to getting hit over the head with special effects in order to put everything didactically on screen. Perfect examples of ruining or completely destroying a truly supernatural mood would be movies like THE HAUNTING (1999)and to a lesser extent the new movie 1408.

I'd like to reiterate what others have said, that the prints are pristine.  I don't know how or why they are in such good shape (maybe the sitting in a vault with no usage for years theory?) but they are.",1190937600,4,1392,4.52191235059761

In Dallas, Texas, it's the Ghost of White Rock Lake.  I grew up here and over the years have heard several different stories surrounding the phenomenon.

1633380,5,B00005NG05,"If you are a fan of horror legend Boris Karloff then this collection of 10 episodes of the never-aired 50s TV series ""The Veil"" will be a wonderful addition to your DVD collection.

All 10 episodes dip into the world of the paranormal (think ""One Step Beyond""). Although the episodes offer a mixed bag of quality, at 25 minutes they move along quick enough to make even the mediocre stories tolerable.

Unlike his 60s anthology series, ""Thriller,"" Karloff hosts AND stars in almost all the episodes. What is great about these shows is that they allow Karloff to play a wide variety of character roles. After watching a few shows you will come to realize what a superb actor he really was. With a few subtle changes of clothing and hairstyle he moves from character to character like a chameleon. From wheelchair bound invalid to gruff sea captain to kindly old Italian country doctor he is brilliant in every role.

Something Weird Video has done a superb job of packaging this obscure series. In fact, the presentation here is better than many more famous TV series releases. If Universal ever releases ""Thriller"" on DVD I doubt they will go the extra mile Something Weird did with ""The Veil."" The episodes are collected onto two single sided disks (do you hear this Universal?) and you get detailed liner notes with an overview of the whole series and info on each episode.

I debated purchasing this DVD collection for nearly 6 months but am quite pleased I got it. Highly recommended for Karloff fans.",1135814400,16,1505,4.732824427480916
1633381,4,B00005NG05,"Fans of the television series ""One Step Beyond"" and ""The Twilight Zone"" will most likely enjoy this collection of 10 episodes that, unfortunately, never aired, at least as intended as a weekly half-hour anthology series.  This was due to financial problems of the production company.  Later, episodes were edited together to create a ""movie"" that was syndicated to local television stations.  Boris Karloff introduces and closes each episode and appears in nine of the ten episodes in varied roles, which showcase his acting skills to a greater extent than many of his horror film roles.

Reflecting its ""public domain"" status, there have been several releases of ""The Veil"" on DVD from Something Weird (Image) and Madacy, and Brentwood Communications included all 10 episodes as a bonus on one of its multi-pack horror DVD collections.  This collection, from Platinum Disc Corporation, is the least expensive offering so far, but that shouldn't put off anyone who has an interest in seeing the series.  Simply put, the visual quality of the episodes is excellent; in terms of its classic TV offerings, ""The Veil"" is arguably Platinum Disc Corporation's best looking release.  That said, it's not perfect . . . as is the case with their other classic TV releases, the Platinum logo appears at the bottom right-hand corner occasionally and there are absolutely no extras, not even a Karloff biography.

The bottom line is that ""The Veil"" is an enjoyable anthology of stories of the paranormal that will appeal to fans of that genre, as well as Boris Karloff fans.",1104883200,27,1562,5.0505836575875485

1633383,5,B00005NG05,"I had never heard of this program before I found the DVD an Amazon, and decided to order it.  When I finally viewed the programs, I was quite surprised at a number of things.
1. The prints are very high quality, especially considering that this was a 1950's made for TV series.
2. The series was never broadcast.  This is amazing considering that the episodes could have easily been in One Step Beyond or Twilight Zone if you blinked and missed the opening credits.  More to the point, The Veil predates both of its more well remembered cousins.
3. They made 10 episodes as opposed to a pilot and one or two other shoots.  As such, there is enough material here to really give the viewer a feel for what this series would have been had it been picked up by one of the networks at the time.
4. Appearances by actors you know.  For example, Patrick Macnee (later of Avengers fame) plays a constable in one episode.
5. Karloff's range in the various roles.  Having only really having seen Boris in Frankenstein and a couple of Thrillers, I didn't realize how deeply talented he was.  You get to see him in a variety of roles here, and when he needs to look menacing, he does, usually through facial expressions and body language.  But it left me with the opinion that he was a brilliant actor.

Bottom line is that if you like Twiliight Zone, One Step, even X Files, this is a must have.  You''ll never get to see it on TV, and it's a fun DVD to watch with the family.",1085788800,67,1465,4.333333333333333
