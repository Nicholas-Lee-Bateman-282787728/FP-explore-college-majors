8313732,5,B0000U0KXW,"This is a very good translation from German to English of one of the most important twentieth century classics: The Metamorphosis, by Franz Kafka. I own several editions of it, but this one is by far the prettiest. This is a book everyone should read at least once. Simply great.",1415664000,,279,4.6
8313733,5,B0000U0KXW,"Got this on a bit of an impulse. The kids absolutely loved it, and needless to say, I'm so glad I sprang for it. Reminiscent of the talking fish story that told place here in the Monsey/Spring Valley, New York area about 2-3 years ago; apparently this really happened. It was so inspiring to observe how this event was put to a good, fun, and educational use, as were the other day-to-day 'shtick' antics and even mannerisms in this delightful video.

Great work Mr. Cohen and cast. Encore!",1113264000,,490,4.568181818181818

8313735,5,B0000U0KXW,"Excellent video. I currently own the entire series. My boys ages 7 and 4, watch it over and over again. They eat it up. I only wish they made more!!",1106179200,,148,3.966666666666667
8313736,5,B0000U0KXW,"Agent Emes is a great movie for the kids.

The special effects and graphics could be a little better, but as this is the first movie, I am sure as the newer episodes evolve new styles will be introduced.

Otherwise, great job!",1106092800,,226,4.357142857142857
8313737,5,B0000U0KXW,"Thank you for making such great videos for our children.  Not only do my kids watch this video over and over again, they run around the house  playing ""agent emes"".  This keeps them entertained  and its educational.  My children can relate to the characters in the way the look  and speak.  I plan on buying every episode.  This series should be in every Jewish home with young children.  I even enjoy watching as an adult!",1106092800,3,423,4.533333333333333
8313738,4,B0000U0KXW,"Agent Emes is video that can be viewed on many levels, and enjoyed on every one of them.
As a children's video, Agent Emes fulfills every kid's (and many adults') dream of being a secret agent, and succesfully overcoming the evil forces all around us.
As a piece of work, it is a loving tribute to the spy genre, with video references to ""Get Smart,"" ""Batman,"" ""James Bond,"" and others that I didn't didn't recognize.
As an educational tool, it touches on many Jewish topics in an entertaining way. And as a platform for communication, Agent Emes gives parents and children, teachers and students, the cool kids and the rest of the class -- a means of talking about the Dr. Lo Tov in all of us.
That's a lot to ask for any video, but it's not too difficult for Agent Emes; because Emes means ""truth"" in Hebrew.",1070409600,,810,4.442953020134228
