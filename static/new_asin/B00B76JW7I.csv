8563540,2,B00B76JW7I,The original narrator's voice was wonderful.  It was very soothing.  Why did they change it?  He dealt with his job like it was fun.  We weren't just watching some actor pound out lines.  He really enjoyed being there and saying what he was saying.  Can we please get the original narrator's voice back?,1520035200,,303,4.622641509433962
