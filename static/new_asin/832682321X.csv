7900944,5,832682321X,"Karbala is the story of Polish & Bulgarian forces participating in the 2003 Iraq invasion along with the US. These 2 Coalition allies US are tasked with defending a City Hall from local militia and what should be a simple occupation mission, quickly turns into a Polish/Bulgarian ""Alamo"". The story, the battle scenes, and characters are all fantastic here--this is a first rate war movie. It is mostly in Polish with English subtitles and easy to follow. My one criticism of the film is somewhat regularly the characters speak in English--and when that happens no subtitles/closed caption appear and its hard to understand what's being said. That small issue aside, if you have seen the many films out there about Iraq/Afghanistan fighting (Restrepo, A War, Over There etc) you won't want to miss this. Like the equally good ""Hyena Road"" the recent Canadian war film about Afghanistan, Karbala lets us see the global conflicts/invasions/regime building the US is doing, thru the eyes of our ""little brother"" partners in the war on terrorism. But make no mistake about it, the Poles, Canadians, Danes, who are serving, these are all incredibly brave soldiers fighting in foreign countries for reasons that are as confusing to them, as it is to American troops as well.",1477008000,,1268,5.014218009478673
7900945,5,832682321X,"It seems that this important battle in Karbala, Iraq involving Polish and Bulgarian troops never made the news, at least here in Australia.  This is an excellent film with Polish, English and Arabic dialogue.  The action is tense and the acting excellent.  This is worth viewing to get some other perspectives, Polish and Bulgarian in this instance, of George Bush's big mistake in lying his way to an ill advised illegal invasion of Iraq.  The action sequencers match the Hollywood standard.",1463702400,,492,5.037037037037037

7900947,4,832682321X,"Polish war movie based on the 2004 Battle of Karbala (Defense of City Hall).  The film is about a group of 40 Polish soldiers and another 40 of Bulgarian ones defending the City Hall in a city of Karbala located in central Iraq,  The coalition soldiers held out for 4 days against cumulative attacks from the Iraqi insurgents, most likely Mahdi Army.  The most impressive two things about this battle are: 1) the Polish/Bulgarian coalition did not lose any men, just few wounded (some severely); 2) the coalition force had only food and ammunition supplies for less than 2 days.  Not that I glorify the coalition force nor did I ever support the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, quite on the contrary.  But I am not hear to voice my political believes...

I would have given the film five stars, but I did not I like that the soldiers were sometimes addressing each other per Mr., as if they were not on duty but in a pub.  It it did not sound realistic and believable.  The film lacked the typical army language/terms that soldiers in every army around the world use.  There was some, but it was not enough and it was not very convincing, or should I say it was: inconsistent.  Also, the film makes out of the Polish and Bulgarian soldiers bunch of heroes who ""come in peace"" are the saviors...and of course the insurgents are presented as evil group who mistreats the civil population, are blood hungry, and most importantly are fighting for the ""wrong"" cause...as if defending your homeland from foreign invaders was a bad thing?

Four solid stars for the production and good shoot-out action.",1454803200,3,1597,4.667857142857143
