4179326,5,B003R6YW5S,"This film is about a soldier wounded in Korea who falls in love with a Japanese Red Cross Volunteer.  The later marry and return to the US and California.  It looks like the Salinas Valley of the 50s.  This is where the real crux of the film lies as the Japanese wife, daughter-in-law and sistter-in-law tries to adapt to her new relatives and surroundings.  There is a Japanese American family she tries to turn to but they are scarred from their own recent incarceration so they can`t provide much support except for a son who tries to help.  A scheming sister-in-law creates a flurry of troubles as she secretely writes a letter to discredit her Japanese sister-in-law to the local farming council.  Ultimately her actions are discovered and her rather passive husband asserts himself as he trys to undo the damage.

While a low level film, this is a good study of the difficulty faced by men and women who come together from different cultures.  The rather simple story (wounded soldier falls in love with his nurse) evolves into a much more complex story of misunderstandings and adjustment that all face.

What is an interesting sidebar about the film is that Shirley Yamaguchi was a Japanese actress who had played in many theathers in China and was nearly executed by the Chinese (Nationalist) government for being a collaborator with the Japanese.  She was reprieved when she was able to prove her Japanese citizenship and expelled.  Following the end of her acting career, amongst other things, Shirly Yamaguchi was elected to the upper house of the Japanese national legislature and served for 18 years.  As far as I know, she is still living in Japan.

I`m not sure saying I enjoyed the movie is correct, lets say  I was impressed with it and the excellent acting of all concerned.  It was a thoughtful film for me and my wife (who is Japanese) and led to some long discussions about America.

I highly recommend this film for it`s attempt to look at the struggles that take place when two cultures connect.",1309478400,11,2019,4.742120343839542

8403295,5,B003R6YW5S,"Disturbing in some ways, but accurate in its portrayal of simmering racial hatred in the years after WWII, this story of a Korean War vet who brings his Japanese wife home to his family farm in Salinas California is a powerful document of its times. As an extra narrative, the neighboring far,m is run by a Japanese American family, whose scion is as angry at ANglos as the white farmers still are at the ""Jap"" because the JA family was incarcerated in a concentration camp during WWII. Bitterness flows both directions, and the Japanese wife (played by the Japanese actress Shirley Yamaguchi, who later would become a minister in Japan's parliament) and her loving husband are caught in the middle of the lingering resentment and pain of loss from the war.",1508803200,,757,4.786259541984733
8403296,5,B003R6YW5S,"The video quality was left to be desired, but this was an accurate portrayal of clashes between two cultures. I thought that Shirley Yamaguchi was excellent. Her scenes later in the film were heartbreaking when she sought refuge at a nearby sympathetic Japanese household. Don Taylor, as always, is a very likable actor, and his scenes with Tae were extraordinarily touching. This man truly loved her. I really hated the brute sister-in-law and I was waiting for her husband to wallop her for spreading vicious lies. It all ended happily with a reunion on a clifftop and I was very moved by the last scene. A movie not just worth watching but for buying. I saw this film for the first time back in the late 60s on TV and wondered why it pretty much had disappeared. I was so glad to see it for sale on Amazon.",1508457600,,809,4.472972972972973

8403299,5,B003R6YW5S,"Excellent performances by the entire cast in this emotion packed film which deals with prejudice and bigotry in post-war America. Shirley Yamaguchi and Don Taylor are wonderful as the newly married interracial couple and Marie Windsor is at her evil best as a wickedly jealous, and callous, sister-in-law.

Keep in mind that the well-worn, but still watchable, print is exactly the same for both the Nostalgia Family Video and the CBS Entertainment DVD releases.",1482364800,,462,5.243243243243243

8403301,3,B003R6YW5S,"Good portrayal of the prejudice and animosity that Japanese women encountered when they came to America in the 1950's.
Shirley Yamaguchi (Japanese actress) with excellent command of English was able to express a very realistic and genuine feeling that many Japanese war brides must have experienced after leaving Japan and coming to America. In addition, the movie did not have any Hollywood stereotypes about inscrutable/exotic ""oriental women"" or have mispronounced English by Ms. Yamaguich as were typical of so many movies produced in 1950 - 1980s! which was amazing considering that it was produced in 1952.",1445558400,,612,5.385416666666667

8403303,5,B003R6YW5S,"King Vidor beautifully directed this war time Classic about a critically wounded WWII Vet's return to U.S. with his new Japanese wife, whom he met in a war hospital; never before seen story. The couple are forced to deal w/subtle, and overt racism of his family & townspeople, especially after birth of their son. This harsh, real-life story is VERY well treated through strong performances of aptly employed, likable actors, tightly presented by the usual sensitive and insightful directing of multi-award winner as Director, King Vidor. This is the American debut of beautiful and then reigning BEST ACTRESS in her country, Shirley Yamaguchi who sweetly portrays suffering wife of handsome Vet Don Taylor. The couple lived and struggled to setup their lives in his parents home upon their arrival in Salinas CA. Chemistry of Yamaguchi and Taylor feels easy, natural, often poignant and always romantic as a much in love interracial couple. Tears & cheers are the order of the day... I don't see how anyone can watch it dry-eyed, especially if you lived through WWII, are a child born from it or a student of it. It's a VERY good movie that truthfully and often uncomfortably lays bare the ugly and greater good that can be raised from harsh racism. CAMERON MITCHELL and MARIE WINDSOR, dependable characters supreme who appeared in a dearth of the days' ""B"" movies are Taylor's Mum and evil-sister-in-law. Turn off your phone, get your popcorn and cheesy corn and coldest root beer (great, strong flavors!) to kick-back for this uninterrupted well done entertainment.

I had been trying every now and again to add this fabulous movie to my collection about 20 yrs before I FINALLY found it on AMAZON! What a find. I expect that you will want to SHARE and TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE's enjoyment with friends/family. Without risk of a ""spoiler"" here, may I carefully say that eventually as well developed characters and story evolves, you won't be sad... ultimately pride in this great Country of ours turns to cheers!
ENJOY!!",1366761600,5,2020,4.958702064896755
