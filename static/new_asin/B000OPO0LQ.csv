8185985,5,B000OPO0LQ,Beneath the show's rough exterior there is a level of truth. Sometimes one must crawl through the mud in order to find what they are looking for. South Park is a lot like that. Behind every episode there is something people can take away from it. Season 6 was no exception.,1395446400,,273,4.372549019607843
8185986,5,B000OPO0LQ,"I'm fairly certain I've already reviewed this product, not sure why it's on my review list again. Anywho, I have been a fan of South Park since the beginning and season six is on par with the rest of the series with mostly well thought-out plots and themes. I admit that I don't own many seasons because nearly every ep can be watched online for free, but if you despise advertisements so much that you can't stand even a couple of them then I would recommend getting this, and every season of SP; plus there's the extra material such as commentaries etc. Either way enjoy the show!",1332979200,,582,4.4485981308411215
8185987,5,B000OPO0LQ,Someone stole season 6 from me so I ad to buy it again bc I need to have this in my collection.  I love SP,1329091200,,106,3.24
