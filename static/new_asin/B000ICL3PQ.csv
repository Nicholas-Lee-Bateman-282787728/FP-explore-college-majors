2654582,1,B000ICL3PQ,"There is little to NOTHING successful in this ""hijacking"" of my favorite Mozart opera.  I'm at a total loss for words but..................if you looking for Turkey you won't find it here.  I'm not even sure this is ""of this earth.""  If you think you know this opera that's good because 15 minutes into this you'll start wondering if the packaging is labeled incorrectly.  I do not object to operas being placed in different locales/time periods and with a very different point of view.  I find that challenging and that's good for me.  BUT, this does not resemble the opera I know in any shape or form.  What I object to here most is (1) the gratuitous violence, (2) the crude sex, (3) the major dialogue changes, (4) the overdone production, (5) the settings that don't give you a clue as to where you are or what is happening - have I said enough?  The singing is average to good but certainly nothing worth buying this for.  After watching Doris Dorrie's fun ""La Finta Giardiniera"", this Abduction was a MAJOR disappointment and hopefully the low point of the Mozart operas at Salzburg during 2006.  I've got 4 more of the Mozart series sitting here to watch and I'm keeping my fingers they are better than this bad idea that did nothing but get worse as I watched it.",1169683200,23,1272,4.563876651982379
2654583,5,B000ICL3PQ,"The truth is I was very afraid ahead of this production. The staging was the responsibility of a 33-year-old - and we know that an even younger director produced the only true scenic disaster so far in this M22 collection, ""Ascanio in Alba"". Also the conductor of this ""Entfuhrung"" was Ivor Bolton - not the most inspired among the men and women who have shared the pit so far. Well, I was wrong on both counts.

Stefan Herheim, the stage director, simply decided to hijack Mozart's opera by suppressing the part of Selim, the enlightened pasha (who only had a spoken role), totally change the recitatives and the texts, and effectively completely change the meaning of the opera: from being a comic romp from the Age of Enlightenment about different mentalities in Europe and in The Orient, the piece becomes a very successful reflection on marriage, most of the time very funny, but sometimes erring on tragedy: this production is therefore a pure and simple hijacking of Entfuhrung, and one could even say a betrayal, but a very talented and successful one. The reason why Herheim's treatment of Entfuhrung is so much more successful than what David Hermann and Christof Hetzer did with ""Ascanio"" lies in the fact that Herheim has a concept, a story to tell, and decides to stick to it all the way through. His set is quite big (it's the House for Mozart, where the M22 Idomeneo was also taped). A movable wall representing the windows of a palace stand towards the end of the stage just in front of a giant screen where different effects, silhouettes, false perspectives are being projected with great success: it adds some ""special effects"" to an already very vivid production. All characters will remain in wedding dress (or wedding suits) during the performance, to underline the purpose of the piece and keep a ""light"" touch to it. I won't even try to spoil anything because the performance is very complex and its very subject (the concept of marriage, its successes and ultimately its failure) is actually visited under very different angles, but there are beautiful ideas, very funny ones (announcing intermission by pulling a plug off an electrical appliance), very poetic ones (two giant Belmonte and Constance on the screen opening a house of dolls populated by their own characters on stage), but also disturbing ones (the quasi-rape scene between Blonde and Pedrillo showing the ultimate inability of man to live in couple).

Musically, it's party time. Ivor Bolton is very poetic, very musical, the orchestral lines are very transparent but contrary to his Giardiniera, Bolton is not reluctant to let the Mozarteum Orchestra give plenty of sound when necessary. He accompanies the ensembles beautifully and gives great consistency to the evening: an unqualified success. Charles Castronovo is a refreshing tenor with strong italianita, he is introducing a breath of fresh air in the tenor roaster of this M22 project. Dietmar Kerschbaum is a solid Pedrillo, his musicality is all the more remarkable that he has a lot to do on-stage. Valentina Farcas is a Blonde with a beautiful tone even if she does not quite control her high register. She is also charming: she is a stunning look-alike of the young Diana Rigg. We were not as impressed by the Constance of Laura Aikin: the voice is acid and even quite strident at times. However, this does not spoil the evening at all: the most beautiful part of the evening is the magical quartet that closes Act II: a moment of pure poetry.

However, let's face it, the triumph of the evening belongs to the Osmin of Franz Hawlata, a legendary Baron Ochs. The voice is very ample with a lot of colours that reminded me of Kurt Moll from time to time. Hawlata also refuses to bark (it could be tempting in such a part) and his stage presence is absolutely incredible.

In Heimer's production, he is at the centre of everything, the cynical [...] who is just here to demonstrate that happiness in marriage does not work and that the best willingness in the world will be of no use. In effect, he is a rough draft of Don Alfonso, and the way the two couples interact are very close to the Guilelmo/Fiordiligi and Ferrando/Dorabella antics in another Mozart opera. I will not be afraid to say that in my view, Herheim's Entfuhrung is the closest thing you will get to a prequel to Cosi fan Tutte. Hijacking indeed, but this journey is worth taking.",1169510400,20,4401,4.802110817941952
2654584,2,B000ICL3PQ,"This only faintly resembles Mozart's Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.
Yes, it's true what the other reviews have said.  There are many brides and grooms running around the stage, many lovely brides in their lingerie.  But there is also a little girl with a butcher knife, chasing some of the principals.  There's no Pasha Selim, but there are many wedding gifts being opened.  There are many caresses between Blonde and Konstanze, AND Osmin and Pedrillo.  At one point Osmin seems to have become a priest of some sort, even tossing a wedding bouquet back over his shoulders.

If all of the above sounds confusing, indeed it was, at least for me.  Many of Mozart's arias are still here--some of them nearly intact.  So what I'm telling you is if you want a traditional ""Abduction,"" this one's been abducted far from Mozart's original work.  But if you'd like to hear some of Mozart's music, while watching bridal gowns, tuxedos, and perhaps a lot of sexual confusion and male/female role confusion, you might really enjoy this.  Seriously, once you get over the shock of how different it is from Mozart's original, it is really quite entertaining.  It's YOUR choice--I just wanted to prepare you for some of what you can expect.",1268697600,9,1225,4.813397129186603
2654585,1,B000ICL3PQ,"Esta puesta en escena de Stefan Herheim, deforma completamente la obra, hace cambios en el libreto a su regalado gusto y utiliza la msica de Mozart, para darle vida a su inmoral historia.

2654586,4,B000ICL3PQ,"Taking great liberties with Mozart's opera, this M/22 production is nonetheless very theatrical, creative, never boring. It deconstructs the original story and morphs it into a non-linear series of statements on male/female relationships.  In other words, forget the story.  As a stage production, it is an incredible performance, an alternative reimagining of the original...which means one ought to be familiar with Mozart's vision and not accept this variation as the final word. It's not for everyone.",1246320000,6,505,5.631578947368421
2654587,4,B000ICL3PQ,"It'll probably enrage purists, so maybe not the best introduction to one of Mozart's best operas. But the singing and the acting is marvellous and there's not a boring moment in it. It'll maybe take a second or even third viewing to enjoy it as there are so many things happening at the same time but once you get it, it's great.

2654588,1,B000ICL3PQ,"I won't give a diatribe about the indecency of this production, the fact that there is some full frontal nudity on stage is not my objection.  My problem is that the story has been completely stripped away in this production.  The opera, as it was written, has a plot which may be silly, but which gives us an idea of 18th century European attitudes towards sex, intimacy and Eastern culture.  In this production the plot is gone and the arias have been used as the basis of a set of essentially unrelated set pieces supposedly giving us insights into the nature of sexual relationships.  The irrelevant action on stage simply distracts from the drama of Mozart's skillfully constructed arias and recitatives.  The result is supposed to give a provocative view of sexuality, but to me seems to be utter foolishness.  To sum up, if this sounds interesting, you might want to buy this DVD, but don't expect it to be a reasonable representation of the opera as Mozart conceived it.",1192320000,8,978,4.723529411764706
2654589,2,B000ICL3PQ,"First of all let me tell this: I love new ideas about theater, opera, arts in general. Really love it... but this SERAIL is a kind of joke without taste. Where is the original idea about the mix of cultures and the battle of sexes written by Mozart? Nowhere. Just a joke about SERAIL without SERAIL. A nightmare... Poor Mozar! What happenened with Salzburg? The two stars of my rating are for the voices and the orchestra.",1189814400,12,422,4.4935064935064934
2654590,4,B000ICL3PQ,"The abduction from the Seraglio"" never looked quite like this updated 2006 version of Mozart's work as interpreted by then, thirty-three year old director Stefan Herheim. Mozarts's opera, recorded live at the House of Mozart, Salzburg, about the clash of values and customs between the East and West, has been, well, changed to a clash between good and evil, men and women, and vice and virtue. The story, in a nutshell, as Mozart envisioned it, is gone. The change outraged the audience when it was first performed in 2003 and continued to outrage the audience in the year of Mozart when it was produced again at the Salzburg festival in 2006.
Well, everyone says opera needs a good shot in the arm to attract new audiences, and Mr. Herheim provided that shot, and some frontal nudity, with this contemporary vision of life in the fast lane of sexual politics - and I liked it.
While the production is a little oblique and modern at times, and required some interpretation (the harem, for example, is now a dozen or so young ladies all in wedding gowns) I found it sensual and intriguing and not difficult to follow - mainly, since the battle of the sexes as played out in the way genders see their roles vis--vis one another, is fun to watch. DECCA has offered, with this 2-DVD package, an interesting entry into the catalogue of versions of this opera that are available, and this writer, for one, prefers what has been offered here, largely because of its contemporary costuming, but particularly because of the sensual performance of silk-slip wearing Valentina Farcas, singing the role of one of the kidnapped women, Blonde. This DVD has a wonderful cast, sung and acted deliciously by all, but most notably by Franz Hawlata, who sings the role of - well, seducer, devil, angel, man - all wrapped up in the character of Osmin.
Those who want to go down this road, will like what they see: the production is filmed in widescreen and uses projected images and film in the background of what might be an updated ""Honeymooners"" set, in a downright imaginative manner. In the terzett, ""Marsch, marsch, marsch! Trollt euch fort,"" for example, we have three characters cavorting on stage in front of their shadows, dancing, but not quite in sync with what is being performed. It's no mistake, but rather an interesting way of showing that things aren't always what they appear. In another scene where Konstanze, sung by Laura Aikin, tempts Blonde, we see Blonde disappear into a shadow and a little girl dressed as Blonde reappear in her place. Wonderful! And in the scene where Blonde drives Osmin form her ""kitchen"" the two wore aprons that silk-screened frontal nude genders. Now, Osmin, didn't have the body of Blonde (although the apron was fit and endowed) but watching Blonde in her silk-slip with an apron that displayed a form (not much unlike her own) nude, was eye-catching to say the least.
This kind of updating can be fun and a little trashy, but it can also be far more interesting to watch and listen to than the dull, over costumed and stuffy productions of years ago, so long as it isn't overblown - and it wasn't. Actually, the production could have been even more seductive (even without the nudity) had a little more flesh and revealing costumes been worn by the comprimarios (brides/harem).
Nothing said above takes anything away from the music, nor its fine delivery here by the Mozarteum Orchester Salzburg, under the baton of Ivor Bolton. I enjoyed it; I think you will, too. This review appeared at OperaOnline.us.",1185148800,7,3539,4.7937806873977085
2654591,4,B000ICL3PQ,"Without question, this is an incredibly bizarre production.  The revised storyline makes little sense, and there is a surprising amount of violence and sexual innuendo.  However, the singers are superb, both vocally and in regard to their stage presence and acting, the orchestra plays beautifully, the chorus is wonderful, and the set is as clever as it is strange.  It's definitely not for purists, or for someone new to this particular opera.  But for someone who's seen Die Entfuhrung before, and is familiar enough with the original story to not miss it, watching Belmonte, Constanze, Blonde, Pedrillo, and Osmin embark on an entirely new adventure -- and push the boundaries of good taste -- is rather enjoyable.",1175904000,7,718,5.111111111111111
2654592,1,B000ICL3PQ,"This is the second DVD from M22 that I have seen so far.  Luck would have it that the library got it before temptation to buy set in.  It is not possible to clean this up by turning off the picture for one scene, as is the case with the M22 Finta Semplice or the Zurich Magic Flute.

Worse still, this production wanders too far from the original story for my taste.  I don't find anything fun about it either.  There is as much underware on display here as in our local mall.  I am not the first person to think that Salzburg Festival is an underware promotional to some extent.

If you want a clever and very well done Regietheater version get the 1997 Salzburg production with Minkowski.  For A traditional production get the Gelmetti 1991 one.

Regretably these do not have as good sound as this 2006 production, but in my opinion the difference is not enough to save this ugly mess.  The singing is too hard driven, in my opinion, negating the advantage of lower distortion.

These singers have great potential provided they back off a bit in the future.",1173398400,6,1059,4.435233160621761

8144843,5,B000ICL3PQ,What a challenge to stage an opera in an area this large. The fashion show was not really needed but added extra color to the set. Excellent cast especially Rebecca Nelsen as Blonde and Kurt Rydl as Osmin. It makes opera available to a larger audience.,1404172800,,252,4.5
8144844,5,B000ICL3PQ,"Surprising, shocking, irresistible. Hangar 7 is a playground for the &uuml;ber rich in Salzburg, built by the owner of Red Bull!
Mozart's opera is transposed from a Seraglio to the decadent world of high fashion...
You can't stop watching and listening! Back in 2013 Camarena was a fantastic Belmonte but not the world's top tenor he is today, and he is so funny!  Mozart would have had so much fun! The camera work looks like a reality show, but is technicaly amazing, using 18 cameras, including the over $90,000 dollars new Canon digisuper 27 lenses ( in case you care).",1402617600,5,573,4.73
8144845,5,B000ICL3PQ,"At its best, opera can be one of most progressive, cutting-edge artforms out there, continually pushing stage-craft and the art of performances to new heights, using live cinema and webcasts to take opera out of the dusty theatres that remain the preserve of a privileged elite and strive to make it fresh, modern and accessible to a wider, younger audience. Broadcast live on Austrian television from an aircraft hangar, Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail Live at Hangar-7 in Salzburg is a fine example of the innovation and creative forces that go into modern opera productions. I don't think that this Blu-ray release of the event will convince any of the traditionalists out there, but at the very least this is an ambitious and largely successful attempt to approach Mozart's entertaining opera in a new, fresh and original manner.

Basically, this is an open-air performance shot in a vast hangar/terminal/museum that holds aircraft, helicopters and classic cars in a boldly coloured, modern, high-tech building with plush cafs and lounge bars. The performance takes place on 10 or 11 stages that have been set-up around the building, the singers moving from one to another seamlessly down ramps and on platforms, singing into clearly visible radio-mic headsets. The Camerata Salzburg orchestra play live from Hangar-8, while the audience (in expensive suits and dresses, carrying glasses of champagne) wander around freely, listening to the live play-back on in-ear headphones, while skipping back occasionally so as to dodge camera crews and avoid bumping into the performers.

The concept for the production takes the opera out of the Turkish seraglio and finds another means of showing women used as commodities by re-imagining Bassa Selim as a fashion designer with a private (sponsored) jet-plane, his seraglio a sweatshop of seamstresses who manufacture his clothes. You might be less inclined to go along with this were the quality of the performance compromised in any way, but it's not at all. Desire Rancatore had the unenviable task of replacing an indisposed Diana Damrau in a highly unconventional production at very short notice and does exceptionally well considering. Rebecca Nelsen is a rather more confident Blonde and Javier Camarena a reliable Belmonte. Kurt Rydl isn't the steadiest as Osmin, but gets by and with Thomas Ebenstein a fine Pedrillo, this is a cast who are more than capable of doing the work justice.

The use of radio-mics allows for softer and sweeter singing that doesn't have to soar above the orchestra and this works well for the singers here. Some might see that as an unacceptable compromise, but it gets the best balance between the singing and the orchestra and it's the end result that counts in this production. With Hans Graf conducting the Camerata Salzburg through an elegant account of the work, it adds up to an impressive and sometimes stunning production of the work. Conceived with a filmed broadcast in mind, the production also looks and sounds simply fabulous on Blu-ray. Extras include a full 'Alternative Cut' which is however rather pointlessly presented in a tiny window in the corner of the screen of the main film. Surely this would have been a good opportunity to put the neglected 'Angle' button on the remote to good use? A 27-minute 'Making Of' answers most of the questions you might have had about the logistics of putting on a production like this. The disc is BD50, region-free, with subtitles in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.",1402358400,,3524,5.103986135181976
8144846,5,B000ICL3PQ,"I second the ""Successful hijacking"" review of Autonome. And I rate this production with the many outstanding offerings in the M22 boxed set. If I could only have one Entfuhrung, this would not be the one. But if I could only have three or four, I'd want this one to be among them. This production is not what Mozart ordered, but it offers a powerful clearing of the palate from the mounds of slop and treacle served up in so many mainstream presentations of Entfuhrung.

Here, the arias of Mozart's Entfuhrung have been taken out of the original story line and spliced into a new, fragmented narrative spun out in completely rewritten dialog and recitatives, with only echos and shadows of the original narrative remaining. It's as if the original Entfuhrung watched back to back showings of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, The Bald Soprano, Peter Pan, and Equis, then fell asleep and had an anxiety dream that mixed them together with the arias of Mozart's Entfuhrung playing in the background.

For me this reimagining of Mozart's Entfuhrung has much in common with the Jean-Christophe Spinosi reimagining of Handel's Messiah (where the music of Messiah is spliced into a remake of The Big Chill). If you utterly hate the one you will likely have a similar reaction to the other, but if you find depth and value in the one you will likely also find it in the other. Both are executed at the highest level of dramatic imagination and musical accomplishment.",1395792000,3,1501,4.813953488372093
8144847,1,B000ICL3PQ,"OMG, some people are just out of their minds. How could the producers accepted to call this Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail, is difficult to understand. Is this the quest for creating something original, or it is just simple alienation?
This is not just a simple transposition from one period to another modern one. The story is wiped out, abducted. The recitatives are changed. The list of roles is changed and there is no Pasha Selim, as they don't need him.
Instead of the original comic opera, we have a graphic description of promiscuity, violence, and bisexual relations, all of which have nothing to do with what Mozart and Christoph Friedrich Bretzner imagined. I simply think that Mozart would have written different music for this new story. This is NOT the Abduction from the Seraglio! They have just plagiarized Mozart arias.
Singing is not bad. I liked beautiful Valentina Farcas in the role of Blonde and Castronovo as Belmonte. I was not impressed by Laura Aikin's  Constanze.
But the modification of the recitatives makes this production bad for either video or audio media.
They abducted a nice, slightly cheesy, but delicious story, and replaced it with a boring sex and violence display.
This is the worst opera production I have ever seen. I LOVE Mozart and I bought the whole M22 package. I accept modern style opera, though I'd rather prefer more of a traditional approach. But this is a bit too much for me to swallow and enjoy.
This production just needs a new name. This is not Mozart Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail!",1370736000,3,1536,4.796226415094339

Even when I did not like what was done, I found it worth watching and it sharpened my critical skills, such as they are.  I did not like it when people who ranted against ""eurotrash"" wrote that the director should write his own opera.

Well Herheim has just about done that, and it is, quite frankly awful.  It is so unfocussed and unrelated to the music that I was unable to get beyond the first act.  Perhaps it got better, but I have my doubts.

8144850,1,B000ICL3PQ,"Given the number of universally negative reviews, I will not say anything new about this macabre production - the sad thing is that even with all the distortions and deconstruction of the original ideas of this opera, it is not even funny.

Perhaps the biggest failure is the fundamentals - the singing is exceedingly poor by the one supposed to be the centerpiece - Konstanze; Laura Aikin is just not a singer who can do this most difficult part.  I spared myself much grief by not even watching it into ""Martern aller Arten"" after hearing what she does in the preceeding arias.  Add to this that she is also made to sing in an awkward position while being dressed on stage, and all those cheap tricks used by modern directors and ministers of vulgarity to ""enliven"" the action.  Needless to say, it fails to save the poor singing and just contributes more to the feeling of puzzle - why would one bother with a production like this?  Why could this not be prevented, and the resources of all kind - spiritual and pecuniary - diverted to something more worthy???

To continue citing this production flaws is somewhat tedious; Valentina Farcas as Blonde is not adequate; Charles Castronovo is a very handsome Belmonte, but his voice is not fit for this role - he is a spinto, a Cavaradossi or Duca di Mantova, not a lirico-leggiero type that is expected of Belmonte.  Perhaps the director wanted to break this rule, too, but the result is not satisfactory; the character of Belmonte is not a hero, but rather somewhat a cautious courtier, as Don Ottavio.

It's hard to say what is the most offensive and outrageous moment of this production - it beats in its ugliness every unsuccessful production I've seen live or on media.  The insertion of foreign sounds or unrelated texts is incredibly distasteful, and reading Shakespeare's sonnet 18 (Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?) in German (!!!) embellishes the utmost bizarre.  I would not even mention the opening scene with a mass rape of white-clad brides who very soon turn to appropriately dressed occupants of a brothel - this is a seraglio in this production interpretation.  However, with this line they did not go far enough to make it innovatively obscene - it is just timidly giftlessly pathetic with a female chorus of whores in underwear, stockings and garters.

The ideas about partners-changing and promiscuity, with Konstanze and Pedrillo vs Belmonte and Blonde as copulating pairs does not seem to be creative in artistic excitement.  Perhaps some thought that such turns would positively surprise the audience, but I am afraid it brought nothing but a deep disappointment by all who saw this performance.

It is rather sad to recant all the atrocities committed here; and I would not recommend it because it is hardly watchable and listenable.

Booooooooooo!",1312416000,6,2830,4.854469854469855
8144851,1,B000ICL3PQ,"As the liner notes freely confess, director Stefan Herheim has altered the opera so that it no longer has any plot.  The first production caused a scandal, resulting in the Viennese audience demanding to know of the management just what had been perpetrated on them.  Although some have called this a hijacking of Mozart's opera, it seems to me more like a completely different stage production that incorporates Mozart's music.  It is as if someone killed, skinned, and stuffed the original opera and used the result to put on a puppet show.

I'm not sure it can even properly be called an opera at all.  The dramatic portion consists of a series of scenes commenting in some way on love, marriage, and fidelity.  The ""characters"" are little better than stick figures serving as symbols to convey Herheim's ideas, their motivation constantly changing from one moment to the next.  In the interests of full disclosure, I found it unbearably disjointed and tedious, and turned it off midway through.  Maybe the later part of the production is better, but judging from the other reviews, I doubt it.

If you decide to watch this production, be aware it isn't family viewing.  You might, for example, be in for a shock when without warning two fully nude people appear onstage.  It's also not a good introduction to this opera, so if you're not familiar with the opera before you watch this, you still won't be afterward.

This was maybe the most horrible production of any opera I have ever seen.",1304899200,3,1494,4.79296875
