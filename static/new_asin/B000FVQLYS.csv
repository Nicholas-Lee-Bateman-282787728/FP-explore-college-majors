8127332,4,B000FVQLYS,"This mini collection is a good way to get acquainted with some cult classic TV series of the 1950's. The only series of the four that may not have reached cult status is ""Joe Palooka"" and that's from no fault of its own.

As far as I can tell, this episode of Joe Palooka is the only one available on DVD. That's a shame considering that the lone episode in this collection is great.

All four episodes in this Alpha colection have good picture and sound. And if you want the experience of sitting in front of a black and white TV back in the Fifties, I suggest that you hit the ""play all"" button and watch all four episodes back-to-back. Each episode is about 25 minutes, with a total running time of about 100 minutes.

Dr. Fu Manchu once again tries to rule the world, this time by holding cities hostage with a strange plague he has devised. When the evil doctor's lovely assistant (played by Laurette Luez) contracts the plague, Fu Manchu has to make a deadly decision.

Flash Gordon battles an evil queen of a dying planet who wants to take over the universe. She has invented a machine that can turn positive worlds, along with the humans who live in them, into negative images. When in negative form, the humans have trouble breathing. So Flash and Dale Arden have to battle time and the queen's henchmen to find the power source of the negative machine.

Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, (played by the beautiful Irish McCalla)and her doctor boyfriend Bob help a bumbling scientist locate a rare jungle plant to make a new medicine. In my opinion, this is the weakest episode in the collection, and that's because Sheena is only in about five minutes of the adventure.

Joe Palooka (played by Joe Kirkwood) is the victim of a joke played on him by some of his boxing buddies. It's Thanksgiving and they give Joe a rubber turkey all neatly gift wrapped. Joe doesn't know it's a joke and gives the ""pre-cooked turkey"" to a poor kid on the street to take home so the kid and his struggling single mom can have a real Thanksgiving dinner.

When Joe is told that the turkey was actually rubber, Joe jumps into action to track down the young boy and his mom. With difficulty he finally locates the boy's apartment, and Joe discovers that the boy, embarrassed that the turkey was a fake, has climbed out his bedroom window and disappeared.

If you want to sample some of these action-filled Fifties series, this collection is a good place to start.",1318636800,2,2446,4.518099547511312
