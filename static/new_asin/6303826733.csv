719183,4,6303826733,"Obviously not as sophisticated in taste as an exhaulted reviewer, my 2 year old still loves this video. In fact, it's the first full-length video she actually sits through. I think the fact that it seems to an adult to be  a bunch of dis-jointed parts actually adds to the appeal for a little  person, allowing them to break it up into episodes in their minds.
Of  course, Gumby is always a hit with little kids and this one is no exception  for ours.",912470400,,451,4.333333333333333
719345,5,6303826733,"My 1 year old LOVED IT!!
She sat enthralled for the entire movie.
I thought some of the characters/events were pretty far-fetched, but my imagination is old.

Definitely recommend to other parents.",1363046400,,197,5.15625
719346,1,6303826733,"It's pretty dated. I don't remember it like this, actually kinda ruined some cherished childhood memories of enjoying the Gumby movie.",1363046400,,134,5.428571428571429
719347,4,6303826733,my daughter realy liked it. she loved the music. and dancing and the clay animation. the picture quality needs a little work.,1362528000,,125,4.7272727272727275
719348,2,6303826733,I'm glad I'm a Amazon Prime member cause i didn't have to pay for this garbage. I remember watching the tv show and it was so much better. This movie was just boring. Bad plot and story line. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.,1362009600,,236,4.266666666666667
719349,2,6303826733,"It should not be placed under ""kids and family"" too much slicing and cutting etc. It is a scary kind of movie and more suited for older kids. Not recommended for kids under 9 years old.",1361836800,,185,4.166666666666667
719350,5,6303826733,"My daughter is fascinated with this movie.  Not sure why---it's a little odd and kinda creepy.  She loves it. Watches it over and over.  It's not violent, it's not annoying, it's not hyper spastic short attention span type deal---so it's a-okay in my book.  the plot is a little weird---but  that's okay.",1360713600,,304,4.769230769230769
719351,1,6303826733,"I remember these programs from my days as a kid. It is just as cheesy and camp 40 years later. The effects are old and tired. The dialog is dull and inferences are lame. Even so, I do recommend watching it if you have never seen it and you are 45-55 years old. Preferably with a fifth of scotch.",1360627200,,295,4.016949152542373
719352,3,6303826733,"Although I seem to remember Gumby was something everyone watched when I was little my 18 month old and 8 year old were not really amused. I got the ""are you for real, Dad!?!?"" look. Other than that... who knows may it is just mine.",1360454400,,231,4.155555555555556
719353,3,6303826733,"I used to watch Gumby when I was a kid, and I bought this for my 3 year old. I found it a bit weird watching it now, as an adult. I wouldn't call it quality television. Sorry Gumby lovers!",1340064000,,188,3.725
719354,5,6303826733,"Sincerely-this is a surreal beautiful story that David Lynch would show his children.

Gumby's dog cries whenever Gumby plays with his band.

Gumby's dog does not cry tears-he cries real pearls!!

Movies like this don't come along very often and we need to celebrate this auture's brilliance!!

Thank you Mr. Clokey.",1130025600,,316,5.137254901960785

719456,5,6303826733,"I just watched the Gumby movie again, and I can say that it holds up extremely well if you're a 80's Gumby fan.

This full-length movie tells the story of Gumby's attempt to create a music video with his new metal band 'The Clayboys'.  This probably sounds familiar since Gumby already created videos on the 80s show with his old synth band 'The Gumbys'.  I guess Gumby is obsessed with MTV.

This movie introduces us to several new characters.  There are 'The Clayboys' themselves:  Fatbuckle, Thinbuckle, and Nobuckle.  Then there are the band's groupies, Tara and Ginger.  And finally, there is the band's canine mascot Lowbelly.  The Blockheads discover a special secret about Lowbelly, and they devise a scheme to use the dog to become super rich.  Of course, this brings them into conflict with Gumby and his many pals.

Almost all the main characters from the 80s show are represented in this movie, with Pokey, Prickle, and Goo playing large roles.  Even the Groobee has a scene!  Denali the mammoth is the only notable absence.

There are lots of side stories scattered throughout the movie.  Several of them have a science fiction theme, with references to 2001, the Terminator, and Star Wars.  There are some funny moments as well, especially the scene with the overturned wheelbarrow.  And surprisingly, there's even be a hint of romance towards the end!

This movie came out on VHS back in 1995, and we haven't seen any new Gumby adventures since (other than the short animation for the Rhino DVD menus).  Hopefully he'll be back with more adventures soon.  But at the very least, somebody release this movie on DVD!",1125100800,5,1629,4.833333333333333
719457,5,6303826733,"This is a clever Gumby movie, created in the mid 1990s, with lots of interesting characters. It has somewhat of a low budget feel to it, and not as sophisticated as the claymation of Nick Parks's Wallace & Gromit or Chicken Run. The music soundtrack is largely a one-man synthesizer, with the exception of the rock songs played by Gumby and the Clayboys, which are slick. The audio mixing is a little annoying since the sound engineer pumped the character voices through a cheesy digital effect, thus making the characters sound like they're talking into a tin can. Nevertheless, the movie plot holds up well and, most importantly, my kids love it and use the story line as a springboard for imaginary play. My copy of the video had a small Gumby action figure included under the shrink wrap.",1059696000,3,792,4.705035971223022
719458,3,6303826733,"I am probably the biggest Gumby fan alive.  I was a member (proudly) of The Gumby Fan Club back in the mid 80's when Gumby was on Channel 5 and 9.  He disapeared for a long time.  I was in college when I saw that ""Gumby:The Movie"" was playing, and was sorry that I couldn't see it on the big screen. I didn't rent it- I bought it ASAP!  Great for kids, and die hard fans, but too long and it doesn't know when to quit. Still it's hard not to love Gumby. Magical, as Gumby enters the story books and meets adventure at everyturn.  You'll see scenes re-created by Gumby and Pokey from ""Star Wars"", and ""Terminator"".  Why this didn't come out in the 80's when Gumby was riding high, is a mystery.  Still, I'm glad Gumby finally made it to the big screen.  Not for everybody's taste.",1005955200,3,779,4.181208053691275
719459,5,6303826733,A wonderful video - that we all enjoy!  My two year old loves this video as he dances as Gumby strums the guitar.  He sings along with the tunes in the video!  One movie where he actually watches the video from start to finish!  Great story plot that entertains not only the kids but the adults as well!  I'm off to purchase another gumby video!,970444800,2,345,4.246153846153846
