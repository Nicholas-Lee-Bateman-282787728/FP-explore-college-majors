7879119,3,6304913540,"Once upon a time, there was a student director who graduated from film school...but had discovered a deep, forboding secret: cheap, student-made horror films had a market in the Japanese video market. So, periodically, he'd make his friends empty thier pockets, and that would be the budget for a film that would be sent to Japan, and released on the poor, unsuspecting masses. This one came back. In all actuallity, it's really fairly decent, especially when you consider the lack of budget, professional actors, and script. I've seen far worse released in the theaters (ok, maybe not media-wise...I think it was filmed on S-VHS, but still....) SEE: *A master villian so poor he has to live in a an abandoned trailer park rather than an evil mansion. *Flying heads. *Billy Joe Bob, Dark Lord of the Sith. *Stupid people tricks. *An philosophical essay on why people in horror films wearing overalls are obviously the killers; doubly so if one strap is unfastened. *Stealth workboots that stay quiet even on dry leaves. *How to play scales on the piano & get your music used in a horror film. *Special bonus feature: special guest appearance by Claudia T. Smith of the Church of the Olde Ones Devivals and Cthulhu for President (Why settle for the Lesser Evil?) Campaign, as Satan's Cheerleader. P>This special edition of the film is complete with outtakes.",994032000,,1357,4.930131004366812
