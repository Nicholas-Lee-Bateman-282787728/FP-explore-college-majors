3823602,4,B001VPJYZA,"The 2008-2009 television season was an odd one.  On the one hand, there probably never were so many great shows.  There was an absolutely astonishing number of great shows, and a large number that were at least worth watching.  For me SAMANTHA WHO? fell not into the ""great"" category but in the ""worth watching.""  I enjoyed it and looked forward to it each week (on the few week's when there was actually a chance to see it), but it wasn't ""must-see"" TV for me like MAD MEN, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, CHUCK, DOLLHOUSE, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, THE OFFICE, 30 ROCK, BREAKING BAD, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, or PUSHING DAISIES.  But not every show that you watch needs to be a masterpiece.  I've watched SMALLVILLE for years, almost always with pleasure, but I'm not sure I would ever rank SMALLVILLE as one of the ten best shows I've watched in any of the years that I've watched it.

Still, I don't understand not merely why ABC did not try to make SAMANTHA WHO? succeed, but seemed to do everything they could to assure that it would fail.  Frankly, ABC is a mystery to me.  In the past the network I've hated the most was FOX, but in the past couple of years they've really racheted back their rampant cancellation of promising shows (even TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES was given multiple chances to succeed, something FOX would not have done in the past).  And they renewed the critically acclaimed and extraordinarily promising DOLLHOUSE despite extremely low ratings (though DOLLHOUSE did reign as the #1 time-shifted show on TV, that is, the show with the most viewers who watched it via DVR, streaming, or downloading from iTunes or Amazon).  Well, I should add that CBS doesn't appear as a blip on my TV viewing radar.  I haven't watched consistently any CBS show in years, given that I hate procedurals and episodic TV, but instead watch passionately character-based serial dramas (or dramedies, like BUFFY, CHUCK, and PUSHING DAISIES).  CBS is TV for those with televisual attention deficit syndrome.  Both ABC and NBC, networks that in the past I have looked to for quality serial television, seem to be engaged in a race to the bottom.  NBC seems determined for its 2009-2010 schedule to be the worst in TV history.  This seems inevitable given that they have eliminated ONE THIRD (!) of their Monday through Friday programming in order to give the spectacularly untalented and unfunny Jay Leno an hour of prime time each evening.  As a result most of NBC's shows have received partial orders.  CHUCK, for instance, will apparently be getting only a 13 episode order.  Well, better than none.  The rest of their schedule is no more promising.  The spring of 2009 showrunner for HEROES, Bryan Fuller, has left, leaving many (like myself) sceptical that the show will continue its brief return to excellence that was seen late last season.  Apart from the last second renewal of CHUCK, the lone  bright spots for NBC are its two brilliant comedies 30 ROCK and THE OFFICE and the way it went the second mile to renew its best series, the lightly watched FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, through a partnership with DirecTV.  But this formerly great network will in the fall have a schedule that will consist of a two-hour version of THE BIGGEST LOSER followed by an unwanted hour of Jay Leno.  The biggest loser is clearly the American television viewer.

At least NBC has a plan.  ABC doesn't even seem to have that.  To its credit, ABC hasn't gutted its scripted programming yet as NBC has, but they have nonetheless engaged in a string of baffling decisions.  In the fall they decided to cancel its most critically acclaimed show, the absolutely brilliant PUSHING DAISIES.  On the same day they also cancelled the critical darling ELI STONE (a show that I very much loved) and the guilty-pleasure series DIRTY SEXY MONEY.  Then ABC Family cancelled the popular KYLE XY, which was moved around on their schedule from one part of the year to another.  The baffling thing about the cancellation of PUSHING DAISIES is that it got more Emmy nominations than any other television series in the 2008 Emmys.  The ratings might not have been what they had hoped, but the ratings weren't actively horrible.  Perhaps they panicked a bit with the Wall Street meltdown, which caused all the networks to retrench a bit.  But ABC seems to have forgotten that a very good (or in the case of PUSHING DAISIES, a very great) series always has a chance of winning an audience.  A bad show does not.  And the overwhelming probability is that whatever show replaces a low-rated, but highly acclaimed series will be both low-rated and lightly acclaimed.  And developing critically acclaimed shows would seem to be an issue at ABC, which has fewer and fewer acclaimed shows, and most of their previously acclaimed shows either no longer acclaimed (DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES and GREY'S, for instance) or nearing their end (LOST, whose ending next year will create a huge void in ABC's schedule).

Now, in defense of ABC, they do have some promising series coming out next year, unlike NBC.  I'm especially intrigued by FLASHFORWARD, which will be taking UGLY BETTY's slot on Thursdays (UGLY BETTY is moving to Friday's) and the midseason series V., a relighting of the old cult miniseries (yes, it also was a series, but it was the miniseries that generated all the excitement).  And I'll at least check out EASTWICK, which stars the great Paul Gross (SLINGS AND ARROWS and DUE SOUTH) in the role made famous by Jack Nicholson.  Still, with all the scheduling ups and downs at ABC, he has become a network that worries me, even if it hasn't quite kept pace with NBC in its race to the bottom.

Which brings me to SAMANTHA WHO?  I apologize for going on at length about ABC, but this show's cancellation seems to me to be explicable only in the context of the confusion at the network.  Does the way SAMANTHA WHO? was handled feel at all familiar?  Maybe like the way that MEN IN TREES was treated?  Certainly one problem was that there was never a natural show that ABC had to pair the series with.  We don't at the moment associate ABC with half-hour comedies.  But this was a fine comedy that clearly deserved better treatment.  Shows that are moved around from one night to another and one timeslot to another rarely do well in establishing an audience.  ABC never seemed able to decide what to do with this one.  They couldn't even decide whether it was a late evening or early evening series.  Nor could they even decide whether or not to show all the shot episodes or hold some in reserve to burn off in the summer (they decided on the latter).

All of this was complicated by Christina Applegate's struggles with breast cancer.  Shooting was interrupted so that she could have surgery.  Surprisingly, the surgery had less impact on her performance than one might have anticipated.  As Samantha, Christina Applegate employed a very physical acting style.  For a couple of episodes, she became decidedly nonphysical, no doubt feeling the effects of her surgery.  As someone who underwent radiation therapy for cancer several years ago, I have all the respect in the world for Christina Applegate for the job she did.  How she managed to be so frisky and energetic while both recovering from surgery and therapy is amazing.  And I don't mean to damn with faint praise or to intimate that she didn't do a great job by any standard.  She was dynamic, charismatic, and a heck of a lot of fun as Samantha.

Primarily I think this show was hurt by the thoughtless way that ABC moved it around in the schedule.  The show more or less died on the vine.  But it was not a perfect show.  I liked the cast, but I don't think it was as a whole a great cast.  I always felt that something was missing in the chemistry in the group of characters.  Part of the problem was that the show was predicated upon someone losing their memory.  I also felt that the show didn't seem to have as much of a story as I would have liked.  There was no real overarching narrative.  As a result, the show often felt like it wasn't about anything at all.  I enjoyed how most of the jokes on the show were at the expense of Samantha herself.  We liked her but enjoyed that she could be the butt of her own jokes (much like Liz Lemon on 30 ROCK, whose epic lack of self-understanding is one of the things that makes that show so marvelous).  But SAMANTHA WHO? more and more felt like a one joke show.  Still, I would have liked to see ABC give it a chance to grow and develop.

So, the cancellation of SAMANTHA WHO? was just one more disappointment in a season that had a plethora of great shows combined with a host of unfortunate cancellations.  Add to the cancellations the ending of two truly great series, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and THE SHIELD, and the 2009-2010 has a lot of timeslots to fill.",1245801600,5,8854,4.666881859264041

3823618,5,B001VPJYZA,"Love this show! So sad that it only lasted 1 1/2 seasons (especially since tons of bad shows have lasted far longer).  Watched every episode when it aired, bummed when it got cancelled so quick, & have been questing for it on DVD ever since.

Not exactly perfect (what show ever is?) but very well-made, from top to bottom.  Funny, quirky, sweet--a proper ""feel-good"" comedy.

DVD does actually have a handful of extras, even though they're not listed in the product info.  I'm a huge fan of bonus material with anything & everything I watch, so I was underwhelmed because they're not very extensive at all.

**For some reason, they didn't present all these episodes chronologically on the DVD.  The set does include all 20 episodes from this season, but 3 are separated into a ""More Sam"" option on disc 3 (they should be episodes 14-16).  So to watch them in the right order, watch the first 2 discs, watch those 3 episodes in the order they appear on the menu, then flip back & watch the last 4 episodes listed.",1435449600,,1013,4.558011049723757

Inspired by her zeal, Sams got everyone letting go and trying new things.

Maybe Sam will find that being good is not such a bad idea. Or maybe shell learn not to be bad unless shes good at it! Unfortunately, this was also the season that this show fizzled after its 2-year run on ABC since it was cancelled in the Summer of 2009, due to slumming ratings.",1391990400,,601,4.463636363636364

I happened upon this series on DVD trying to find something new and funny to watch.

HILARIOUS!!

I enjoy the fact that if I want to watch a silly, little something I don't have to pop in a full movie...at 22 or so minutes a show, I can get a little burst of laughter in my day or night...  Double feature??  Double the laughter!!

It's really unfortunate that it wasn't renewed...it was a lighthearted sitcom that had so much potential.  If you liked the first season then you will really enjoy the second season even more.

I think it had a couple more seasons left but Samantha...I will miss you, and I hope others feel the same.

I gave it 4 stars (although that is based on my opinion) Some general information: 3 discs, 17 episodes as well as 3 bonus episodes of hilarious, romantic, somewhat quirky Sam & friends.

3823680,5,B001VPJYZA,"In 2007-2008, the first season of ""Samantha WHO?"" debuted after ABC''s  ""Dancing with the Stars"" and the show immediately was a big hit and received praise from many reviewers and viewers.  And eventually, the show was successful and was the highest rated sitcom for that year.

Unfortunately, the second season had a new schedule and no successful lead-in show and put up against other successful shows and the ratings dropped.  Although not a significant drop in viewership, ABC opted not to renew the show due to economic reasons (the network wanted producers to cut $500,000 from the budget per episode).

Despite the shocking cancellation of the series, fortunately ""Samantha WHO? - The Complete Second and Final Season"" is released on DVD and those who missed the final seven episodes can now catch it with this final release.

""Samantha WHO?"" is a sitcom created by Cecelia Ahern (writer of the 2007 novel ""P.S. I Love You"") and Donald Todd (writer for ""Ugly Betty"", ""Life As We Know It"" and ""Caroline in the City"").

The series is about a woman named Samantha (Christina Applegate, ""Married with Children"", ""Jesse"") who was a rude and not so kind person.  But after being a hit by a car, she has amnesia and doesn't remember too much about how she was in her past but with a few memories and what she learns about herself, she wants to make herself a better person.

Because she forgot so much, she is unable to work and is trying to piece together her life and thus she depends on her parents Howard (Kevin Dunn, ""Transformers"" films, ""Gridiron Gang"",  ""7th Heaven"") and Regina (Jean Smart, ""24', ""Frasier"" and ""Designing Women"") for their assistance.

And to help her through life are her two best friends and former co-workers such as the bad/party girl Andrea Belladonna (Jennifer Esposito, ""Rescue Me"", ""Related"" and ""Conspiracy"") and the chirpy Dena (Melissa McCarthy, ""Gilmore Girls""), her ex-boyfriend Todd (Barry Watson, ""What About Brian"" and ""7th Heaven"") and her apartment doorman Frank (Tim Russ, ""Star Trek: Voyager"", ""Life Free and Die Hard"" and ""iCarly"").

But as she has her memories of the way she was back then, she does have occasional memories of Todd and when they were a couple and how badly she treated him and even being proposed by him.  The problem is that once she has these memories, she forgets them.  Nevertheless, with friends and family she starts to get her life all situated.

For ""Samantha WHO? - The Complete Second and Final Season"", 17 episodes are featured on three discs.  Here is a listing of the episodes on each disc (note: the following are spoiler-less summaries):

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Samantha WHO?"" is a sitcom presented in Widescreen (with an aspect ratio of 1:78:1) that is shot via a single camera and not the typical multiple camera setup.  So, one thing that people will realize about the series is that it looks more like a drama series and although shot on set, there are many scenes where the show is shot outdoors and the picture quality on DVD is very good.  For the most part, the series is well-lit and doesn't have the problems of excessive  low-noise or high compression.

As for the audio, ""Samantha WHO?"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is primarily dialogue driven, so it's primarily front and center channel-driven.  I was hoping to hear an episode such as ""The Rock Star"" which takes place in a small concert stage with the audience cheering utilizing the surround channels, but I didn't really hear anything.

So, pretty much the series is front and channel driven but if you have a receiver capable of stereo on all channels.  Personally, I found that setting the best for watching the show.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Samantha WHO? - The Complete Second and Final Season"" comes with the following special features:

  * Girl Chat - (2:24) Christina Applegate, Jennifer Esposito and Melissa McCarthy answer questions about their character and relating to the show.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that I was shocked that ABC canceled ""Samantha WHO?"".  After all, the series was the top rated sitcom for its first season, Christina Applegate was nominated for an Emmy for Best Actress in 2008 and how courageous Applegate was by doing the show even though he had to face a mastectomy.

Needless to say, the show's viewership may have went down due to not having ""Dancing with the Stars"" as a lead in show but still, the show had millions of viewers and truthfully, many viewers and even entertainment magazine editors felt the show didn't deserve to be canceled.

But here we are with ""Samantha WHO? - The Complete Second and Final Season"" and fortunately, now people who missed the final seven episodes, can catch the second season in its entirety on DVD.  And for those who are wondering about how the series ended, fortunately the creators of the show managed to create a satisfying conclusion to the series.  Also, a bit open ended just in case another network wanted to pick it up.

The characters are just enjoyable to watch.  There are many episodes featuring Samantha remembering her past life and trying to start over with her new life despite not having any past memories.  Her mother Regina is actually quite interesting and to see the mother and daughter dynamics at work is quite hilarious.  Especially since Regine and Samantha have drifted apart since Samantha was a much different and crude person in the past.

Jennifer Esposito as Andrea Belladonna was very enjoyable to watch.  As Kim Cattrall's character of Samantha was for Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex & The City"", Andrea is that sexy vixen who also has that crude/party girl humor that she brings into the friendship between her and Samantha.  And Melissa McCarthy as Dena is also quite interesting because she is so different from Samantha and Dena but she's still part of that circle and brings that perky ditsyness but also logical thinking at times.  So, for the most part, what makes ""Samantha WHO?"" so enjoyable is its characters and the wackiness that ensues in each episode.

Overall, ""Samantha WHO?"" was an enjoyable sitcom with plenty of comedy and every character was fun to watch.  In fact, there wasn't any episode that seemed boring at all. Again, I think it was a wrong decision by ABC to cancel the series but for those who were curious about the sitcom or fans who enjoyed the series, definitely pick up both seasons of  ""Samantha WHO?"" on DVD.  You definitely won't be disappointed!",1251244800,31,10342,4.642935982339956

3823682,5,B001VPJYZA,"Samantha Who? was a show I had written off as silly and pretentious but I was wrong and now I can't get enough of this now cancelled show. Without Christina Applegate playing the title role, I don't think the show would have been so refreshing and witty. Applegate is a gifted actress, I remember her on Married... with Children and even then she had this natural talent for slapstick comedy. Applegate was the backbone of this little show, I never saw season 1 but season 2 is clever, frank, and well-written. The chemistry is evident and Jean Smart is freakin' hilarious! Too bad this show wasn't given a proper send-off but hopefully this gem will become a cult classic one day. I highly recommend it!",1246924800,11,704,4.64
