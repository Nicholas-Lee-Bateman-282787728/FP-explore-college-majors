8003384,2,B0000V429Y,"The best of Chespirito Vol. 1 isn't what I thought it will be. I'm a big fan of all his characters. But I was thinking since I got Vol. 1 I will be seen some of the earlier episodes. It wasn't like that, they started with newest ones. They don't have the all original cast member, and it isn't the same. The episodes aren't as funny as the used to be. Another thing this DVD doesn't come with extras like some of the other DVDs of el chavo that I have. What they added as addional material were 4 tv spots that are 30 seconds long each. That really sucks!!! They only really good thing of this DVD are 2 episodes of El chavo del 8 that are really funny.",1268697600,,653,4.030769230769231
