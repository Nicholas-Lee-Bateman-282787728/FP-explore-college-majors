3506380,3,B001C6MP8Q,"this may be a good dvd to learn from, but in my personal opinion, its too annoying to watch. I personally think the music dosent go at all, her accent is a bit distracting, and maybe this is silly but her hair drove me nuts. its funny cause i usually wouldnt care about these little things, but i just want to turn it off after a few minutes. One more thing is that she seemed to speed through some things, maybe it wouldnt be so bad after you practice though. If these little things are unimportant to you, than give it a go. Hope you like it if you do get it.",1246060800,5,561,4.017857142857143
3506381,5,B001C6MP8Q,"World Dance New York adds to their great body politics section with ""Self Defense for Women "" technique and workout by Tayah Kansik. Aside from blood curdling screams, or perfuming an attacker while mistakingly reaching for mace, just invest in your personal safety and learn this self defense technique for only a few dollars and in the privacy of your own home. This self defense program can also tone and strengthen your arms, and legs. It is very well detailed with plenty of repetitions which will improve reaction time. This method is user friendly. The instructor and her partner execute each move well and move with ease to visually guide you in using your body in self defense. Learning self defense is priceless, and can save your life.
I viewed the entire program before trying it out. The segments are taught as one on one and from a defense point of view in probable case scenario as the instructor and her assistant  execute the moves.
The program is divided into upper and lower body training.
You will find:
Basic position and basic boxing moves , foot work
Stretches for quad, hamstrings, arms
Push kicks, knee, and body kicks
Hooks uppercut boxing combos, footwork
Jab, elbow shots, hook and elbow shot s and uppercut
The technique section begins with a warm up
Combo1:  incorporate ""the roll"" while defending from a direct attack
Combo 2: defending from a punch directed at you, clothes and hair grab defender, head lock defender, and properly applying the technique.
Included are takedowns, ground work, illustrated with instructor and partner.
Also a cool down with gentle yoga stretches. I thoroughly enjoyed this program and will continue to view it as to improve my skills, and be less fearful walking to my car at night.",1226188800,25,1745,4.872053872053872

What this DVD teaches us is aggressiveness and speed, the 2 things that will save us in an attack. At a beginner's level, a complete lesson on what to do in the event of an assault is practically impossible, because of the unpredictability of the assailant, but if you keep practicing these moves, you'll be prepared to counter with a swift response, an assertive stance, and some good kicks and punches. It has been proven that if you seem vulnerable and defenseless you will be more susceptible to being assaulted, so the attitude you present to the world is very important.

Tayah Kansik has a great attitude; a very attractive English self-defense expert, she exudes self-confidence and assurance, and has a terrific resume in having taught self defense to the police force and others. Also on this DVD is Mr. Will, very patiently standing in as a human punching bag, and falling repeatedly with those nasty kicks to the back of the leg Tayah deftly gives him.

You get a warm up, a lot of basic boxing moves, and the defenses while being grabbed are excellent, where often one's natural inclination would be to back away, but instead Tayah shows how it is best to sometimes move into it to get out of it. As Tayah recommends, you should build up speed by practicing these moves. It's my opinion you'll also get stronger and feel more confident, and just by this attitude alone, be less likely to be caught in the horrendous situation of being attacked.",1223078400,18,1536,4.681481481481481

8286168,3,B001C6MP8Q,"I bought this DVD because I will be starting college soon, and I wanted to learn new ways to protect myself.
This video is simply 60 mins of demonstrations. It claims to be fast pace, but I found myself standing in front of my screen waiting during awkward pauses.
Besides the flow of the video, I did find myself sweating with all the movements (though I did throw one of my old shoulder injuries during a punching segment, warm up a little extra to prevent this from happening to you!). However, the pauses and moderate pace make this video a bit tedious to do more than twice.

The content of this video was mostly kickboxing skills and maybe three other types of moves (getting out of a headlock etc.). Tayah Kansik was informative, but I found it a little difficult to do some of the moves while she was facing me on the screen (I would have to mirror a complex movement with my hands and legs).

Overall, this video isn't a bad thing to have if you have no prior self-defense training. If your like me, and you just want to learn a few things, this video isn't a bad option. As a workout video, I don't recommend this DVD at all.",1313020800,5,1135,4.323943661971831
