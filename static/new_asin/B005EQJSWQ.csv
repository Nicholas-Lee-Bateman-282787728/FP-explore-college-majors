4666983,5,B005EQJSWQ,"There is one particular scene in Singham that is floating around the Internet in animated GIF form (when he shoots out the van's tire) that got me interested in this film initially (thanks Reddit!).  I showed it to one of my friends, and in seconds we were ordering the DVD from Amazon to make it a special movie night.  Singham succeeds all around as a fantastic action movie.  As someone who grew up on mainstream American cinema and only more avant-garde stuff later in life, this movie was a breath of fresh air!  The main character, Singham, was a good, upstanding guy who does what's right no matter what side of the law that entails.  He has to make some tough decisions, but his persona stays strong and he doesn't brood about it.  The fight scenes were top-notch, and it's clear that the fight choreographer wasn't afraid to ham it up a little and make some of fight sequences defy physics now and then!  The opening dance sequence and other music and dance scenes provide a liveliness that one does not simply find in American movies anymore.  Singham is a very accessible and relatable film for American audiences who are wondering what Bollywood is about.",1326326400,,1167,4.658536585365853

4666985,4,B005EQJSWQ,"Rohit Shetty, for those of us who do not know, is the son of ""Shetty-Ganja"" - the fight director whose ""Tiger"" was treated like a purring pussy by Amitabh's ""Vijay"" in many a maar-dhaar masala pot-boiler of the good old days. I suspect his closeness to Ajay Devagan is due to his and Ajay's dad's (Veeru Devagan) professional comaraderie (both were fight directors). Whatever the reason of t...heir bond, they sure make super-hits. Singham is a movie akin to a ride at Disneyland, where after the seat belt is clicked on, one sits back and enjoys, screaming in sheer excitement through most of the experience. Some supercilious audiences may call it a ""masala movie"" , which term they use derisively. But I go by what Aamir's munna in Rangeela believes. I really do NOT care much about the genre of a movie as long as it is ""paisaa-vasool"". And this movie is twice my paisa-vasool. Must watch for the ones who like Indian masaaledaar cuisine, with extra masala. And remember - ""say no to piracy"" (Main bhee Anna)",1315785600,4,1012,4.691011235955056
4666986,4,B005EQJSWQ,"Singham is back to basics story telling
Singham reminds you of the Hindi films that were made in the 70's and the 80's, where the story line was pretty straightforward, a honest cop, tries to correct a corrupt system by taking on the baddies and winning. MOst of these films were action films where the heo beat the living daylights of all the baddie singelhandedly. 'Singham' is a remake of the Southern film and stars Ajay Devgan ( son of Veeru Devgan) who teams up with Rohit Shetty as the director, who is also the son of ace film baddie Shetty is a tribute to that era.

The backdrop is Shivgad, a small village on the border of Maharashtra and Goa. The film tells the story of an honest, diligent cop Bajirao Singham [Ajay Devgn], who fights against injustice and prejudice using his own ethics and principles. A sudden strike of destiny sets up Singham against the powerful criminal/politician Jaykant Shikre [Prakash Raj], challenging his morals and beliefs. Jaykant's powerful planning and force makes Singham land up in the ruling city of Jaykant Shikre, where he leaves no stone unturned to make Singham's life a nightmare to live. Ajay Devgan is a honest cop in the small town of Shivgad and is well respected and feared by villagers and criminals. Through the course of his work, he clashes with politician and goon, Jaykant Shikre ( Krishna Raj), who wows revenge. Shikre is unable to extract revenge on Devgan and in order to do that, gets hi transferred to the city of Goa. He makes his life a living hell. How Singham extracts revenge is the rest of the movie.
This is a great entertainer and full of many powerful scenes, the scene at the movie theater where Ajay Devgan punishes the guy who has attempted to molest his girlfriend, most of the scenes between Krishna Raj and Ajay Devgan, the retaliation against the minister at his office are some of the best ones. Most of the scenes are the kinds which made people standup, clap and throw coins at the screen, eliciting this emotion in people today is hard but this film did just that. Trust me, I saw this film in a crowded theater...
The action scenes are terrific, Rohit Shetty loves the slow moving frame and flying vehicles - plenty of those here. The drama component is extremely rivetting and I could not keep my eyes off the screen for the 2 hour and five minute runtime.
Kavita Aggarwal is bubbly but wasted here because you just want her to disappear from the screen. Ajay Devgan is amazing, not only in the action sequences but also in the dramatic sequences. Devgan gives ample proof of his star power and shows us why he one of the most bankable stars today. His director buddy, Rohit Shetty has done a great job with te film and action sequences, directing both.
This film could not have been imaginable without Krishna Raj, who has delivered one of the finest villanous acts in recent times. Whether he is vicious or pathetic, he was just simply awesome. The last time I loved a villian was when I saw Anupam Kher as Dr. Dang in Karma.
One of the most entertaining films in recent times, high on raw power, story telling and emotion is an enjoyable ride. Highly recommended. Four stars.",1313366400,3,3171,4.602473498233215
4666987,5,B005EQJSWQ,"Okay, I stumbled upon this by accident. Someone made a reference on a forum about crash and burn and showed the scene when he rips the guy out of the flipping car. So I looked this movie up. I would have preferred a bad voice over since my eyes kept missing action from the movie with the subtitles. That aside, he's got Bruce Lee kick @$$, Grasshopper's (Kung Fu) wisdom and Columbo's mind torture that he knows you did it kind of thing. I can't keep the theme out of my head. A great movie I think although a little long. Now go watch it!",1419984000,,540,4.152380952380953
4666988,5,B005EQJSWQ,"Well, I love Ajay Devgn, so I will usually rate his films this way.  I like the good guy with a conscience wins out kind of movies....",1409356800,,134,3.962962962962963
4666989,5,B005EQJSWQ,"Bajirao Singham's ""style of working"" (hang on while I put on my Aviator sunglasses) is not a style, so much, as a mandate, where that mandate is to do whatever the hell you want.  Rohit Shetty's immensely popular 2011 film, Singham (""Lion"") is a remake of an earlier Tamil film.  It stars Ajay Devgn as the titular character, the only honest cop in a nation so corrupt it would make Kevin Spacey's Frank Underwood slightly uncomfortable.  The film begins with a lion's roar and, having set that tone, follows Devgn (often in slow motion) as he walks dramatically at things.  Singham is, in fact, introduced with a colorful musical number of which he is, strangely, an active participant -- an act of self-aware parody that strides a fine line between awesome and ridiculous.

Eye-copulating the camera from behind his sunglasses as he walks dramatically forward, sideways, and forward again, Devgn invites the viewer to contemplate just how tightly tailored his uniform is... but only after he emerges from a spiritual bath (in Singham Returns, I believe he might actually be bathing in the Ganges). Making tiger-claw motions at the fourth wall, Singham is daring you to challenge him while warning you not to take him up on this foolish proposition. For Singham fights with all the unabashed recklessness of a cartoon character, tiger-slapping his enemies on the head (complete with video-game coin-noises) and bouncing human bodies about the landscape in an orgy of dramatic, slow-motion walking, clawing, and more walking.  Have I mentioned the slow-motion dramatic walking while staring? Because for the love of Ganesh, there is an awful lot of that.  I mean really a lot.

If your initial reaction to being threatened by a group of thugs is anything other than, ""Tear out the nearest lamp post and use it as a mace to beat them senseless,"" you're not thinking like Singham.  What would Singham do when menaced by a powerful politician? He'd tell that politician he had planted a bomb in the man's car, that's what.  How does Singham cope with a corrupt system? By planting evidence in his enemies' cars and then arresting them to show them that corruption doesn't pay, of course. In the first Singham, his soon-to-be-trademarked ""Now I've lost it"" catchphrase seems almost like a throw-away line... but don't worry, by the time we get to the sequel, they'll be hammering that bit like a sorority girl on a winery tour.

A movie like Singham has two touchstones. One is its physical confrontations, the centerpiece of which is a vengeful Singham tearing the aforementioned lamp pillar from a railing and using it as a mace to beat multiple enemies. The other is the movie's politics, key to which is a vengeful Singham beating powerful people he probably ought not be beating because of the degree of trouble this is bound to cause later in the movie.  Singham isn't happy if he's not creating ancillary property damage (he never throws a guy through the air if can can throw a guy through the air and through a windshield or plate glass window) -- and he never, ever considers the implications of his actions.  It's as if his decision tree goes only as far as, ""Hey, I could just tiger-slap this a-hole,"" and all other branches fall away once this determination has been made.  He's like a Hindi Jack Bauer with a brain injury, stuck in forward gear and oblivious to the difficulty he's going to cause himself.

Given this, the fact that the plot of the film revolves around a scheme by a powerful villain to intimidate Singham psychologically (said villain successfully drove a previous police officer to suicide) seems almost dead on arrival. Singham has no psychology to intimidate; he faces every problem by putting on or taking off his sunglasses and slowly walking toward (or away) from it (before or after beating it soundly about the head and neck with his open hands). You can't bribe him. You can't scare him. You can't make him wear a pair of pants that is not a size too small. You can only get out of his way and hope you haven't offended him when, as he eventually will, he reaches the conclusion that the only solution to his current set of problems is to drive to your house and murder you while his fellow officers look the other way.

4666994,5,B005EQJSWQ,It is totally action  movie with fight against corruption....  Ajay Devgan did a good job. Very well played his character.  Movie is entertaining. It has both action/comedy and some thought provoking dialog.,1345334400,,207,5.40625
4666995,5,B005EQJSWQ,"SINGHAM'S DEFINITELY WORTH A WATCH FOR ACTION FANS .

THE VERY HANDSOME AJAY DEVGAN is in his groove. He's playing the part of local lawman who believes in his family and community . If a problem arises he tries to solve it with his brains and understanding of his fellow man. Whoa unto those who choose violence against his fellow citizens or try to go around the law , they will be punished summarily.  Appropriate for all able to understand the dialogue. As young as 8 and up I would think.

When a major crime syndicate boss from Goa is told to sign in Singham's town for his continuing parole/bail , he sends someone else.... and a bribe. They are literally thrown out the door and the money back in their face. When the Don himself returns and tries to make trouble for Singham, his whole town takes to machete's ,clubs, scimitars, and kitchen knives to make him feel their rage.  The mob boss plots his revenge. First things first a forced transfer to Goa.

Singham is now in the same town as his new lady love so that's good. The bad side is he is being harassed daily by the vengance seeking Mob boss and his goons. His lady love tells him to go after them like he did before but he lacks backup . He slowly gains the respect and support of his fellow officers and they finally understand what it is to be part of the real brotherhood of police officers. They start to clean up the cesspool of a town instead of contributing to the problem. They also prove the innocence of the officer that was left no choice but death. They finally back him when it was too late for him . It's not too late for that officers little son and widow to have some justice served and his name cleared.",1336608000,,1689,4.315457413249211
4666996,4,B005EQJSWQ,"Singham the only release this week was houseful today. People found the dialogues really funny and witty,action too got regular applause. Especially young guys do like such action packed movies. Ajay Devgan has well chiseled body here and director takes every opportunity to show it off. Prakash Raj seems quite a cartoonish villian like in those pink panther or other such stuff. His dialogues at places are really funny. This film does seem an extension of Wanted+Dabang. Hope public does not get overdose of such police action flicks.
Here it seems director has especially catered to his Marathi audience,lots of dialogues are in Marathi,does seem anti Karnatka too. Sonali Kulkarni is seen here after a long time. Sachin Khedekar scenes are funny too,and incidents really common place that do happen around you. Ashok Saraf the Hum Paanch guy too is here all funny in a good role. A song comes in between and people go off for a loo break.
