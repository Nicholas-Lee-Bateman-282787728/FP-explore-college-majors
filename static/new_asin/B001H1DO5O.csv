8307609,5,B001H1DO5O,This copy auto starts in Japanese with english subtitles. All you have to do is use the audio button on the remote or go to the main menu and change the audio settings. I had no problem with this set minus it takes a min to start and the picture gets distorted at some parts for a secound but fixes it's self fast. Over all verry happy with this purchase and I could not beet the price :),1439683200,,388,3.9871794871794872
