8104160,5,B000E1JOY8,"I agree with the other reviewer, this DVD is the perfect way to introduce Princess stories to the youngest viewers. My daughter gets scared easily when watching the Disney movies, but adores this Rankin Bass collection of stories. They aren't too scary for her at all, and entertain her enough to watch again and again. Her favorites are Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Good value for the $. Try it!",1217203200,,399,4.714285714285714
8104161,3,B000E1JOY8,"One of the most fondly-remembered animated series from Rankin/Bass, FESTIVAL OF FAMILY CLASSICS originally ran in 1972 and continued in syndication all the way through to the mid-80's.  This DVD pulls together four of the ""princess""-themed episodes, namely ""Snow White"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Cinderella"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"".

Briskly telling each tale in around 20 minutes, the FESTIVAL OF FAMILY CLASSICS titles will be a great introduction to younger children with short attention spans; and will no doubt also still appeal to those who originally grew up with the show.  The line-art is superb and the character voices are fantastic.

Classic Media/Sony Wonder have also released a few more compilations from the FESTIVAL OF FAMILY CLASSICS series under the ""Family Classics Adventures"" banner.",1151884800,,802,5.549180327868853
8104162,5,B000E1JOY8,"I am speaking of Cinderella in particular. The full length Disney version is much more ""serious"" and contains some questionably agressive dialog and images. This scaled down version is much more humorous and light hearted as are the other three stories on the disc (although Grimm's fairytales are a little sadistic considering they are written for children! ) I have gotten more value from this DVD as my children ask for this disc over the originals. I'd like to see more in this series.",1145577600,2,489,4.833333333333333
