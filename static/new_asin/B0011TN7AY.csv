8242241,5,B0011TN7AY,"I have been working through this video for over a year and it has been really helpful in teaching me how to knit. I have only gotten about 40 minutes in. Generally, I will use this video to learn a new stitch, then make a project with it (typically a simple scarf), so it is slow going.

If I had tried to watch the whole video and learn all of the stitches at once, it would have been too overwhelming. However, the digital version of the video makes it easy to take the learning at my own pace. I can go back to a particular part when I need a refresher or don't quite understand something.

My advice to those using this video to learn knitting: take it at your own pace! Take advantage of the Amazon Video Player to pause and watch sections as often as you need to.

These are the time stamps for the different sections of the video (up to 40 minutes, which is where I am now):
1:30 - Cast on
4:50 - Knit
7:30 - Purl
11:00 - Fix a slipped stitch
13:00 - Cast off
17:00 - New ball of yarn
20:50 - Ribbing
26:11 - Seed Stitch
29:00 - Shaker/Thermal Stitch
33:15 - Circular needles, regular
36:00 - Circular needles, cast on
37:55 - Circular needles, rounds
40:00 - Double pointed needles",1447891200,2,1189,4.160869565217391

8242243,4,B0011TN7AY,"I would give this a five if it was easier to get back and forth to a particular lesson in the video. Sound is kind of weird and could do without the background Beethoven, but it's still a good video for a leftie wanting to see another leftie knit correctly. Wish there were more left handed tutorials and at least one book for lefties, but we adapt quite well to a right handed world.",1400284800,,384,4.202702702702703
8242244,5,B0011TN7AY,"FINALLY!!!!  Some good instruction for truly left-handed knitters, NOT those just using the Continental method.  I haven't watched the whole video yet, but the teacher speaks clearly and the closeups are easy to follow.",1357689600,3,219,5.411764705882353
8242245,5,B0011TN7AY,"When ordering a copy of the book ""Left-Handed Knitting"" from Amazon, I discovered the ""Beginning Knitting for Left-Handed Knitters""(DVD) so I ordered it at the same time.  After looking over the book I had purchased I thought the DVD would probably not be of much use to me so didn't look at it for a few weeks.

I was so wrong.  I am totally thrilled with it.  It is the best teaching tool I think anyone could get their little left hands on.

Our instructor, who comes into our living rooms with her soft gentle voice and easy listening back-ground music brings the joy of Knitting to life.  Some methods are the same way I taught myself.  Many are different.  I am committed to learning and practicing her way because they look better and are easier.

In addition to basic knitting stitches many difficult stitches for left-handers beyond the basic are included.  I find myself going back to the DVD frequently to review a specific technique till I get it right.  Methods of handing our needles, equipment and project are incorporated into the lessons.

I have contacted the author of the DVD and have ordered a different one which should be in my possession by tomorrow.  Can't wait.  I am patiently waiting for the release of a DVD which will teach us ""Entrelac"" early in 2012.

If you are a left-handed knitter, do yourself a favor and buy the DVD.  It will be the most inexpensive ""Home Schooling"" you will find.

For the first time in my life I have been able to pick up my beloved rosewood knitting needles, sit back in my easy chair and just ""knit.""  No transposing directions and strugging to figure them out.  Gotta love it.

8242246,3,B0011TN7AY,"I already know basic knitting. I rented this video from the library because I was interested in other ways of casting on, I only know one way, plus I'm left handed. This video is ok, but I think a beginner might get discouraged, please don't, just try other videos out there, and books as well. The lady instructors fingernails are a bit too long so it can be hard to see what she's doing at times, she has a slight nervous accent, the audio is not the best, plus she is working with a very difficult yarn that is not recommended for beginners. Worsted weight yarn is the best yarn to knit with as a beginner, some yarns like the one she is using can split easily causing a mess of frustration. Happy knitting.",1295049600,19,710,4.3059701492537314
