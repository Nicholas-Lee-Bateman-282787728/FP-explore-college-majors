8360640,5,B002B41L06,"Founded in 1993, Chandler, AZ. based AFA ENTERTAINMENT wholesales and retails PD motion pictures in both full and widescreen formats. Cover art is often repros of vintage movie posters. They also provide a transfer to DVD service for videotapes and 8mm home movies. Their film dubs offer no commentary, deleted scenes, subtitles or other bonus features. Quality of these unrestored transfers is based on condition of source material, which can vary from very good to only fair.

Since this film was never widescreen, AFA has either stretched (and thus distorted) the image, cut off the top and bottom, or used a combination of both to simulate a widescreen movie.

In CARNIVAL OF SOULS, after surviving a terrible car accident, a young woman moves to Salt Lake City to take a job as a church organist. Frequent visions of a ghostly spectre eventually lead her to an abandoned pavillon's ballroom, where dancers straddle the line between the living and the dead, an eerie scene that brings with it self-realization of the girl's own fate.

A remarkable first-and-only motion picture from industrial short director Herk Harvey (who also cameos as the undead man). This one's cult status seems to grow with each passing year. A must see!
