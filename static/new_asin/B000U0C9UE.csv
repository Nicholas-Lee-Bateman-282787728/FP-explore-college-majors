2912919,5,B000U0C9UE,"After months of chronic pain in my low back, hip and sacrum, I am so thankful I found this viniyoga therapy.  Within a week of doing the exercises daily, I regained strength and stability in my target areas, and am continuing to enjoy these benefits and increased mobility and flexibility.

Dedicating 30 minutes a day to this gentle practice has changed my perspective on the importance of self-care. Three weekly visits to the physical therapist, daily meds, regular massages and over $1000 in co-pays have not given me what Gary's simple, effective therapy can.

The DVD provides helpful information in a simple format. Take from it what you need (I recommend reviewing the educational information in the first sections to increase your understanding of this vital system in our bodies. For examle, you learn about how we need to contract, expand, and relax our muscles to enjoy full health in this area). In the exercise sections, Gary's slow, measured approach allows you to focus on your breath and healing postures to make the most of this self-care routine.

If you are looking for relief, you've found it.",1196899200,175,1114,4.9411764705882355
2912920,5,B000U0C9UE,"I have alot of pain in hip area.  I went to doctors to find some relief and was recommended to practice yoga.  I wanted something that focused on my lower back and hips.  After a quick search on Amazon, I found Viniyoga.  I felt immediate results and the instructor takes the time to show the techniques and give info on why people are in pain.  The DVD also gives you the options to vary the intensity of your workout.  It's also very relaxing and I feel so much better.  It will save you alot of money if you've been seeing doctors or going to classes to don't give you focus you need for these problem areas. A nice feature is the MP3 format you can download so you can practice anywhere!",1195257600,39,691,4.229007633587786
2912921,4,B000U0C9UE,"This DVD is okay. All of the exercises are simple you just have to watch it first and then try the exercises otherwise you might not know what he's talking about, if you're not familiar with yoga.",1194825600,3,196,4.324324324324325
2912922,5,B000U0C9UE,"First, this is a high quality production.  I mention that only because many yoga dvds are such low quality.  Gary Kraftsow is a real pro -- the visual and voiced instructions by him are excellent.  The theraputic advice is clear and to the point.  He says in the intro that the only way to focus on each of these poses is to know what their purpose is, so the first section of the DVD is educational and informative, the second is a pose by pose description, and the third is three separate practices, about 30 minutes apiece.

Kraftsow also favors function over form -- a welcome relief from America's silly yoga Culture of Perfection.  You do the poses to strengthen and heal your back, not to compete in some ""pose off"", a la Bikram Yoga.

Pose instruction is easy, and the poses are very basic, even for someone in the throes of back pain or who has never done any yoga before.  The sessions are flow yoga style and there are three different workouts, focusing on different issues.

All in all, highly recommended.  Namaste.",1189641600,389,1028,4.538043478260869

about your anatomy. What I love the most is that when he has a model do one of the poses, he explains exactly what the pose is doing & what the benefits are to whatever body part. This is exactly what I needed. Im not paying $45-$70 for these fancy DVDs with music & lovely backdrops!

2912926,5,B000U0C9UE,I bought this video years ago and put it on my shelf.  This morning I woke up with back pain so bad I had a hard time getting out of bed.  When I did I put this DVD in.  I could barely do some of the exercises and couldn't do the Bridge at all.  I completed to the best of my ability and my back actually felt worse at first.  Got an ice pack and got back into bed.  Woke feeling much better.  Did the video again after about 4 hours and was amazed at how much more I could do and how much better my back felt after just two 23 minute sessions.  Its sunday so I plan to do one more session today and then go to once daily.  I am truly amazed at the difference in back flexibility and the reduction of pain in less than an hour.  I guess its true what they sat it works if you work it,1512864000,,783,3.7195121951219514

2912930,5,B000U0C9UE,"I bought this video five years ago, and have since used it many times to rehab back and hip problems; both on its own, and sometimes as a continuing program after physical therapy.  I have found it to be a highly effective program, allowing me to regain mobility and live free from pain.  I have also used it for extended periods for general wellness, and I find it very satisfying.  Like other yoga videos that I have used, I would say that it should probably not be used by someone completely unfamiliar with yoga.  There is no substitute for hands-on yoga instruction; as with any exercise there is always potential for injury or just simple misunderstanding of important details that a video cannot provide.  But for anyone who has studied yoga with an instructor for at least a year, this video is an excellent supplement.",1509667200,2,827,4.675862068965517

2912934,5,B000U0C9UE,"I've had this DVD for a few years now and I thought it was about time I reviewed it. I've had painful hips and feet for years and this is the only thing that really helps me feel better.  It works better than Ibuprofen or steroid shots.  I can't say whether or not it could make my pain completely go away, because, foolishly, I only do it when the pain gets bad.  I keep meaning to do it every day, but things get rather busy.  I haven't used the actual DVD in years because I downloaded it to my phone, so I can't remember how easy it is to navigate--I just know the yoga practices work. It is very ""no frills"" but I don't mind that because I just play music on another device. I got it for my hips, but amazingly, the stretching helps my sore feet feel better too.  Try it!

2912936,5,B000U0C9UE,I just tried the lower back part of the DVD last night. I have a bulging L4 disc in by back and I was feeling tightness in the right side of my lower back yesterday. I remembered I had this DVD and decided to try it. I watched the lecture part and it was very informative and definitely makes you feel better going into the exercises. Again I just tried the lower back part of the video (23 mins) and I was relieved that they were easy to do and slow going to make sure you don't hurt yourself. After I was done my back felt so much looser and relaxed than right before I put the DVD in. I'm 29 years old and having this issue can really put a damper on the range of active things you can do. I am going to try the hips exercises tonight. This really gives me hope that with time I can strengthen the muscles in my back so I can hold off surgery as long as possible or hopefully not get surgery at all. Definitely recommend this DVD for people with back injuries.,1502668800,,963,4.020833333333333
2912937,5,B000U0C9UE,"As someone who has a small frame and is not very athletic, I've had lower back issues for a while.  I always had tight muscles (even as a teenager) and things got worse once I had kids.  About the time my son was 1.5 years old, my left leg began to hurt when I sat.  After seeing multiple doctors and a few trips to the ER they all said, not sure what's wrong.  I met with a physical therapist who gave me a bunch of lower back stretches to try.  I have to admit, I did not stick with them.  When my daughter turned 1.5, I began experiencing the same pain.  After a month of pain, I found this DVD on Amazon.  I read the review and thought, this worked for others, it could work for me.  I began the practice on Tuesday.  I was surprised how quickly a 21 minute lower back practice could stretch my back and make me feel better.  I did the practice Tuesday - Thursday.  I was surprised that by Thursday I was able to put my head on the floor during one stretch where on Tuesday I was no where near the floor.  I didn't do the practice Friday or Saturday, which was a mistake.  I did the practice again this morning and wasn't quite as far as I was on Thursday.
This is something that is quick enough and easy enough that I can do it every day.  Gary talks you through every pose so there is no need to actually watch the video, which is nice for me since I do these poses with my eyes closed so I can better focus on the movement.  This is different than your main stream yoga.  No Downward Dog or Tree Pose.  The main thing I like about Gary's viniyoga is that the poses are exactly the same as what the physical therapist gave me 2 years ago.  That made me think that this was the yoga for me.  I'm still doing the stretches that the PT gave me, but Gary's video includes when to breathe and how long to hold the pose.  You don't hold them nearly as long in Viniyoga as the PT told me.  The constant movement in Gary's Viniyoga seems to work better than holding a stretch pose for 30 seconds.
If you have lower back pain, haven't been able to get relief, and have 20 minutes a day to spare, get Gary's Viniyoga for Low Back.  It won't cure you overnight, but it will give you hope that you can live a life without left leg pain.

UPDATE - I did the hip practice for the first time this morning.  I was elated when I got to work and could actually sit in the cafe chairs!  I even mentioned to my breakfast buddy that I could actually sit comfortably.  I realized that my hips are very tight and I will need to continue with these practices daily to get complete relief.  But with just the first time doing the hip stretches, I felt some relief.  My leg pain came back by the end of the day, but I will continue to do these stretches as they do work!",1502582400,6,2750,4.059479553903346

I make time to do the back and hip yoga exercises every second day until I am strong enough to do them every day.  Three weeks ago I was walking with a walking stick because the pain in my lower back was so debilitating, I couldn't get out of bed because of severe inflammation of the sciatic nerve, where I would just lie there crying.

It must have moved something into place, I don't know what it did, all I know is my hips feel great!

Having done the routines on this dvd a number of times now, I can't recommend it enough!  My back and hips feels so much better.  When you first do the dvd you will feel like the routines aren't going to make much difference as they seem so gentle.  But of all the types of physical therapy exercises I've done for my back, these routines, have by far, had the most positive and immediate effect.  My back is no longer really stiff in mornings, upon waking and no longer aches when driving.  I've been sleeping better too as I'm not having to shift positions constantly due to my back aching.

The routines are 23 to 34 mins long and easy to follow without having to watch the screen every second as the verbal cues are very clear.",1500595200,3,885,4.392638036809816

2912948,5,B000U0C9UE,"I have suffered lower back issues all of my life, due to an injury in my 20's.  After suffering a hard fall a few months back, a fall that severely sprained my SI joint, I was destined for surgery in order to obtain relief.  Nothing I or my Dr was doing was providing any improvement or relief from the pain.  I purchased this as a final effort, prior to a surgical consult at the recommendation of my GP, and I could not be more pleased.
After doing the 23 minute therapy session the first time, I felt encouraged.  It hurt, but it felt ""right"".  After doing it a week, I started to feel improvements.  I still hurt and the SI joint was still ""catching"" on me, but I was able to obtain some level of relief.  I've been doing the same beginner session for a few weeks now and, with only the use of anti-inflammatories, have had no pain or ""catches"" for 3 days.  I am going to continue with the therapy session for another few weeks before moving on the the strengthening sessions (I tried a strength session, and it brought back joint pain, so the injured site was not ready for that yet).
Overall, I feel this was the perfect solution for my situation.  The exercises not only addressed my immediate injury, but are helping to relive the other back pain I have been experiencing for the past 30 plus years.  I call this a ""Win-Win"".
As many people say, this is a no-frills, boring video.  But the instructions are clear, the program is well paced, and most importantly, it worked.",1494892800,3,1481,4.388278388278389

Now, as a 45 year old running mom, I have had back issues that continually were creeping up on me.  I'm SO glad I was finally at a point of doing something about it.  I had went to the doctor (pain pills) the chiropractor (a little better) but the work she did on me was no lasting.  I finally had my back go completely out on me, as in, SLAM, fall to the floor, no more standing up.  TALK about pain!  Completely unable to move, and when I could, oh my did it hurt!  I was, of course, 8 hours from home, at my sisters.  I borrowed muscle relaxers and pain pills to get me through until I could get home.
After one week of complete bed rest...laying flat on my back on the concrete floors, I found this DVD on amazon.
Gary is a little bit funky, yoga funky if you know what I mean.  I'm not a yoga person...or wasn't until I go this!  I did his work out every day for weeks..and couldn't believe how much better I felt!  So good that I actually did fall asleep at the end of it several times.  Talk about relaxing!  I needed to do it at night, not in the morning!  Within weeks I was up and about again.  Now, 4 years later I still do many of the stretching exercises that I memorized from this video.

He set me up with an exercise program to build my muscle strength to counteract my back problems.  I stayed with the program for 3 months with no real relief.  This DVD was recommended to me by a family member.  After three days of doing just the lower back program I felt relief!  I was elated that I had such instantaneous success, especially after not having any success with a reputable doctor's intervention.  I also like the fact that it is a much less expensive and more successful intervention than going to physical and massage therapy two to three days a week.  I purchased the DVD recently for a friend and she also reports experiencing relief from lower back pain.  One thing to keep in mind is that I knew from a doctor's examination and x-rays that my problem was muscular.  As a result, I felt comfortable that yoga could be a good fit for my problem...

Yes, there is a lot of information to learn in the beginning but you don't have to watch the lecture (I did, it's very interesting).

I really appreciate how well the exercises are described.  You don't have to awkwardly look up at the screen to figure out what you are supposed to be doing.  I hardly have to look at the screen at all.  That makes the yoga practice much more fluid and enjoyable.",1426204800,6,609,4.188034188034188

2913066,5,B000U0C9UE,"My wife ordered this. She says, ""I got this and another low back DVD in the same order. Both had very high ratings, so I decided to try both of them. After trying both, there is absolutely no comparison--this one is informative, simple, clear, and very well done. I have had a bulging disc with chronic pain for about nine years now. I have had to go see the chiropractor on and off, and on one occasion, the pain even landed me in the emergency room, where they were quick to offer narcotics. I have found the pain to be frustrating and it has limited me. I watched the video this morning and gave it a try, even though I had been a little guarded about trying yoga because I was definitely not interested in delving too deeply into the spiritual aspects. I found this DVD to be refreshing because, while it touched on those things, the greater focus was on providing quality information on the way my body works and how to use this particular type of yoga in a way that would help me. This is exactly what I needed. I really like the way the introduction is organized, and I really liked the clear way in which the goals were laid out. My favorite thing about this DVD is that I noticed an immediate improvement in my flexibility and pain. In fact, a short while after I completed the DVD I sneezed a couple of times and did not have to brace myself. My body was flexible and strong enough after 23 minutes of a lower back routine to handle some sneezes! If you are living with lower back pain, I think you know what a major statement I just made. In sum, this DVD is very well priced, very clear, very informative, and very effective. I have a feeling that if I stick with this and keep using it, I will get off of this repeated routine of chiropractor visits and bracing myself to sneeze.""",1424217600,8,1793,4.292035398230088

Until I purchased this DVD.  Within 3 days of performing the exercises on the DVD my back was feeling much better and stronger.  The DVD is very slow and methodical.  Perfect for someone that does not know much about yoga and at the same time is in a lot of pain.  Exercises very clearly explained.  Would recommend for anyone that has an injury they need to get over and also for use after when you are trying to keep you back strong.,1423958400,5,609,4.234782608695652
2913068,5,B000U0C9UE,"If you have back pain, then I suggest buying this immediately.
I have been dealing with moderate to excruciating back pain for well over a decade. I have purchased and tried many things to alleviate my condition. This yoga routine is HANDS DOWN THE BEST INVESTMENT I'VE MADE YET. The best part, it costs less than a copay at the chiropractor. The only thing it doesn't provide is self motivation. Pain is my motivation, so I do the routine frequently.
I was out of work for months due to my back on a few occasions. I'm a construction estimator now, but used to be a tradesman for many years. I tried multiple trips to physical therapists,  chiropractors, orthopedic surgeons,  neurologists, etc, etc. Fusing my back was highly recommended due to greatly depreciated discs with bone spurs at the L4 5 6 and S 1. NO WAY!  I'm in my early 40's,  fusions won't last as long as I plan to live. Repeat surgeries leave people in eternal misery. I don't know anyone that is pain free after that. People are often much worse after the surgery. So I searched for other alternatives.
Physical therapy and chiropractic care were only temporary, time consuming, expensive, and provided limited results. A friend of mine said that what he found worked best was YOGA. I'm a man, and we don't use the Y word. BUT, after a month of immobility,  I was willing to try anything. So I searched for a dvd since I'm not self motivated to read a book and apply it to a routine. Luckily I found Vinyyoga's dvd for lower back, sacrum,  and hips on Amazon for less than 20 bucks.
I could barely do any of the exercises at first since I waited too long to find an alternative solution. I mean, I could barely walk. I SLOWLY worked up to doing all of the routines. Combining this with my health and wellness facilities treatment, (at that time), thumper massager, and inversion table helped me to become functional again. In fact, I often go PAIN FREE for weeks at a time. Why for only weeks?  Well,  I get lazy and stop doing it cuz I feel better. So, I have been doing Viniyoga off and on for over 2 years now.
This is by far the best remedy for my pain. I wish that I would have found out about it a decade ago. I even get awkward looks from guys since I preach about how good it works. Cuz ya know, us men don't do yoga. So guys and gals, don't hesitate to get started feeling better. Remember, it won't even put a little dent into your pocket book. UGH... I can't believe I just publicly sang the praises of yoga. Oh well.
BTW, I haven't been to a chiropractor for about 2 years. Please don't wait as long as I did to start healing your back. Some damage can become irreversible.  These exercises can help someone even if it's just mild discomfort.
 Good luck to those of you who get on board the healing train.",1423612800,17,2788,4.364864864864865

So far I have only done the lower back and sacrum and the hip sequences.  I don't feel strong enough to try the strength sequence yet.  However, the two that I have done have been extremely beneficial and help my pain tremendously.  It is wonderful to reach the Savasana pose and lay there and feel your whole body tingle the good tingle, with no pain at all, and you get up and you feel really wonderful because of the practice you just did!  I honestly can't say that about a lot of workout videos.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this series to anyone suffering from low back pain.

I've been following the first that's designated physical therapy. The video is flows at a good but cautious pace. After each workout, my back feels so much better and after the routine, I can stand normally without pain. A real gift. I originally suffered from sciatica and lower back pain. Thought the sciatica is gone, I still have to be careful about what I lift. This video definitely makes a difference.

When I consistently do the routines on this DVD, my back stays loose and pain-free.  One thing I learned from this, as opposed to simple stretches, is the benefit of counter-acting motions.  After a forward bend, you will do a back bend, etc.  I did not understand the value of this before I had this DVD.  $15 to eliminate back pain?  I'll take that all day.

After the 30 minute hip session I feel like I've had a massage and chiropractic adjustment that opened up the spaces in my lower spine and hip.  I do have knee problems, too, and an exercise on the DVD requires you to be on your knees, I was worried about that but compensate with a thick folded blanket under my knees. You could just skip that exercise but it really does help stretch and open the hip.  Others have mentioned the lack of music, scenery and the monotone voice.  I actually like that.  I don't need the distractions from those things and the monotone voice is very soothing.  I really appreciate that he gives you adequate time to breathe in and out and move from one position to another.  He also incorporates rest periods after every few reps so that you don't over extend yourself.  Highly recommend this DVD.  In fact, I'm on a quest to see if he has others.

2913076,5,B000U0C9UE,"I have been having back problems for many years due to sport injury. The situation was getting worse in the past months and started to become a chronic problem. The Viniyoga Therapy is a pleasant surprise as it provides an effective set of exercises which not only target the back and hips, but it also help stretch and strengthen other parts of the body including the knees and thighs.

The video provides a nice introduction on back problems and techniques related to Viniyoga. It also has a set of three different programs  which we can use as our daily routines with the duration of 25 to 30 minutes each.

The best part is that I did the programs daily for 2 weeks and got noticeable improvement on my back pain. The exercises are not difficult neither with nice a pace between each.

Highly recommended to those who are experiencing back problems",1420848000,4,852,4.622516556291391
2913077,5,B000U0C9UE,"I wholeheartedly recommend this video.  I've had low back issues for over 4 years and this video is finally making a difference after trying physical therapy, pilates, a year of chiropractic, various exercises I've found on the internet, meditation, and probably a couple other things I've forgotten. However, please PROCEED WITH CAUTION. I say this because even yoga can injure people if done wrong, or if you do something you're not ready for.

Here is my further recommendation: Listen to everything on the video first. It is loaded with excellent, interesting, and relevant information. Don't attempt any of the movements in isolation, that is, when you determine which workout is suitable for you, attempt the poses in the sequence presented in the workout. Just use the section that demonstrates all the moves as a way to become familiar with the poses visually.

There are three workouts that get progressively more challenging. Start with the least challenging and work your way up slowly. I've been on the first workout for several weeks now and still don't quite feel ready for the next level. I do the workout every day in the morning after I get up. If you've never done yoga before you may even want to work with a yoga instructor to get a feel for it.
Krefsow's instructions are really excellent in my opinion, but I know from experience that it's important to perform the poses correctly or you may hurt yourself or not obtain the full benefit.

If you have knee issues and cannot get on all fours some of the poses may not work for you, however, the movements are gentle. I use a small pad that's about a foot square for my knees that I found at Sports Authority. I have arthritis in my hands so to avoid pain I don't lean on my palms when on all fours; instead I make a fist and lean on my knuckles.

I have listed several precautions because these are things that have helped me, but the workout I've been doing is actually quite gentle & simple with no standing poses, yet still challenging and effective. I think most people could get through it.",1420588800,18,2066,4.64931506849315

Each time I went I was told I shouldn't be in pain anymore.  I was still in pain.  Someone said yoga.  I bought a video.  I couldn't keep up with the instructor.  And the moves were not helping my back feel better.  So I bought Viniyoga for the lower back.  Love it.  I am not in pain as long as I do the 30 minute workout 2 to 3 times each week.  I am as active as before hurting my back.  I have told everyone about this video and everyone who has tried it loves it.  My sister took a good fall and hit her lower back.  In pain and felt physical therapy wasn't helping.  Sent her the video and she isn't in pain anymore.  My husband was complaining about his hip aching.  I finally convinced him to try it.  Loves it.  Now he does this video with me and isn't complaining about his hip.  For those complaining about the voice of instructor,  I love the relaxation of his voice.

Each one is short, so you can do them every day, mix 'em up, do two or all three.  He doesn't have music on his videos and that did not bother me with the other ones, but on this one - frankly the workout seemed to really drag.  It was hard for me to stay focused.

That said, there is nothing wrong with the exercises.  When I can get myself to do one, I do experience back pain relief.  Unfortunately, in order to get myself in the mood I usually have to do another work out first.

If you are new to yoga and approaching it from a physical therapy point of you, you will get a reasonable introduction to the practice from this video.  The movements are easy and well explained.

  I don't like the fact that I can't skip past the introductory narrative and I am not fond of that. The exercises are very slow and steady. Some family members indicated that they were too slow, but for an older person with no yoga experience this was the right speed for me.
  There is a section where you can just study the positions prior to going through the routines, also a plus for me.
  It turns out after two years of pain, that I had a torn hip muscle which was the possible cause for my sacrum and hip issues. I am just recuperating from surgery and I look forward to trying this DVD again and possibly this time I will be able to advance to the hip exercises and then the maintenance.

This is truly what I would consider a therapeutic, step-by-step plan for strengthening and alleviating back pain.  It's simplicity and ease is one of the reasons I like this DVD.  You most likely won't sweat or burn a lot of calories, but you will feel the muscles being worked.

I have intense back pain at times from an accident.  It's in the lower back and it can REALLY hurt sometimes.  Since doing this DVD, I've noticed a decrease in the frequency and level of pain.

Doing the first practice (for low back and sacrum) on this DVD is working better than the chiropractor (and costs waaaaaaay less).  The first time I did the practice was the first moment of relief I had in over a week.  I could actually breathe and relax.  Each repetition brings me nearer a healthy (pain-free) lower back, and the effects last longer and longer each time.  I can't recommend it enough.  Haven't yet reached the point of moving on to the other practices (only been at it for 6 days, and the low back is slow to mend), so I can't offer a review of them.

2913154,5,B000U0C9UE,"This is a well thought-out workout for people with lower back pain, although anyone with severe, debilitating pain or specific problems such as slipped discs should definitely see a physiotherapist or doctor before trying it out, since there may be exercises that exacerbate their particular problem. But, for the general back pain many adults experience as a result of sitting too much, weak core muscles, etc, this is perfect.

The disc is broken up nicely, so you can use it repeatedly without having to waste time on finding the relevant section. There is a thorough overview of the correct technique for performing each movement, which, even with some yoga experience, I found very helpful. There's also a section on why people get back pain, which I didn't watch all the way through, since it seemed somewhat irrelevant (also, the production values on this, while more than adequate for an exercise DVD, do not quite make for riveting watching.)

There are three main exercise sessions to choose from. The first one is appropriate for someone who is currently experiencing lower back pain and can't do any strenuous activity. It's fairly gentle and easy - I've been doing it just before going to bed, I find it helps me stretch out and relax. It runs for about 22 minutes. The second session runs for about a half hour and focuses more on the hips, which are usually involved in lower back problems. It's slightly more challenging, but still a mellow workout. The third session is for people who have recovered from their back pain and want to strengthen the back. It's also about a half hour, and after running through it a couple of times I'm really starting to feel the benefits.",1386374400,2,1688,4.817241379310345

1.  Know your own limitations-- check with your Doctor before starting if you have an injury or condition.
2.  Sit down and watch the ENTIRE dvd before starting any thing.  I know, I know- takes time and can be boring but you will get a good sense of the proper form and also how proper breathing is KEY to each pose.
3.  Try to do it every day.  There are 3 practices (I do 1 & 2-- haven't tried 3 yet) and they are a PERFECT length.  It is really hard to find an excuse not to do this daily-- and that is another reason I love it so.  If I have to carve out 1 hr for exercise I can find 100 ways to get out of it but the 23 & 32 min sessions are perfect and you feel better for doing them.

If you do ""standard"" yoga, you may be quite bored with this but if you are like the millions of us with terrible back pain that just want to find something we can do to stretch, breath and feel better -- this is it!",1383091200,4,1172,3.8619246861924688

The directions are clear, the pace is very relaxing and effective, but not too easy, and I really appreciate the lectures that appear at the beginning of the DVD. I watch them periodically to refresh my memory about anatomy, and it's very helpful to know from where and why the pain occurs.

When I'm in serious pain, I do phase 1 and 2 one after the other to get a good stretch and to rehabilitate. When I feel stronger, I do phase 3 which is a bit more of a challenge. I really appreciate how gentle phase 1 is when I just need to slowly ramp back up, or if I am feeling lousy on any given day. It's just enough to relieve the pain without overtaxing my body.

On a personal note, I must say I disagree with other customers who've complained about Kraftsow's demeanor. I don't find him the least bit boring. What I see is an expert who's credible and has generously shared his National Institute of Health approved expertise for an incredibly low price. I am fighting chronic pain on a daily basis, and I really appreciate his soothing voice. His brilliant, thorough explanations are neither over my head nor are they delivered in a patronizing manner or a harmful, disrespectful ""just do it 'til it burns, then keep going"" high-intensity way. It is also refreshing to see the people featured in the video. They are in good, supple shape, but are no means booting up steroids, doing pushups before filming to look ready for battle, or scantily clad and over-shiny, looking as if they are about to shoot some sort of creepy soft-core adult video. I also appreciate that there is NO music. There is nothing more irritating to me than background music on exercise DVDs, and all the more so during times that I am supposed to relax. In this instance, I need to focus on releasing pain, on breathing, and on my health, not my own sighs and eye rolling and annoyance when I think, ""god, there's that horrible oboe solo again!"" or ""why does this have to be paced at such a high octane tempo?!"" If you're a dancer, musician, or sensitive to background noises, you'll probably appreciate what I mean.

This DVD is about rehabilitation and maintaining strength for people who are really looking for serious help. If I could rate it higher, I would. The benefits can be felt all day long, and I'm so grateful I found this method.",1379030400,7,2471,4.486666666666666

I have gone through countless chiropractors, epidural injections and ""dry needling"" (which was so far the best treatment), trying to get relief.  Having a high tolerance for pain, it would get so bad sometimes that I would cry myself to sleep.

I ordered both of the videos, one for neck and upper back and the one for lower back and I absolutely LOVE THEM!!!  If you are looking for a typical yoga video, this is not for you.  There is no soothing music and the approach is more ""clinical"".  If you are looking for relief from chronic pain, I highly recommend it.

Gary Kraftsow does a great job educating the audience on the causes of neck and back issues, proper positioning and execution of the poses and using a ""normal"" person to demonstrate while he verbally guides you through each pose.  There are also multiple sessions on each video taking you from gentle stretching to strengthening and stabilizing.

Don't have to worrya bout any of those things with this DVD.  I bought it a month ago, to help with pain my lower back - to help strenghten that area without feeling like I'd been run over by a truck when I was done.  This DVD not only helps center on that specific area of the lower back (etc) but does it slowly, simply and without any unnessary distractions like music or seagulls in the background.

Kraftsow's voice is easy to listen to and although some may find it boring, it reminds me alot of the late Bob Ross - you know that painter guy who used to paint happy little squirrels in happy little trees? - that type of soothing and relaxing tone.  And his easy going style and slow take on the positions is extremely helpful to someone like me who can't jump from one pose to another in 1.5 nano seconds.

I've mostly done the first video on the disc, the 22 minute one. It's the least taxing, but you still get what you need out of the routine.  This particular routine is also the perfect jumping off point for anyone starting Yoga for the first time and for those with back issues who want to begin slowly.

I also appreciate that all 3 videos are not over-long.  These aren't 40-60 minute routines where you just keep thinking that you can't wait for it to be over.  Short and sweet and I'm pretty sure it's helping me feel stronger and less pain in the lower back. If nothing else, it's forcing me to work muscles that probably haven't recieved enough attention over my 41 years.  And that can only be a good thing.

I still will never be able to push my body into pretzel formation, but simple basic moves help make this DVD a must have for me.",1378512000,2,1782,4.221238938053097

My only caveat:  if you are new to yoga and starting from scratch, you may feel like you're falling behind in a few places where he simply moves too quickly from positioning to breathing instructions.  Don't be discouraged, though:  after a few viewings, you get better at anticipating where your hands should go and when you'll need to roll over.

This is not something for a quick fix. You have to do it often and and continue to do it for it to work. The video put it perfectly. It's like brushing your teeth to get the results you are looking for you have to be vigilant.",1376265600,,700,3.8275862068965516
2913187,5,B000U0C9UE,"I have been suffering from sciatic pain for at least 6 months, and have tried a variety of therapies. And then I found this tape. I have Gary's book on yoga therapy and am a yoga teacher myself so of course I know the power of yoga. And I was doing some yoga in my attempt to fix my back. The thing is I did too much. Too much variety, too long a practice, and of course too irregular. This DVD is just right. Not too long and very simple poses that anyone can do. The instructions are clear and the demo's skillfully done. And the best part is I felt relief right away and daily life returned in 3 to 4 sessions.

The poses build on one another. Often going back and repeating a pose. In other words the sequencing has been very well thought out. There are not a lot of poses, but they target low back hips and sacrum. The first two segments are particularly good for beginners or someone really out of shape, but it was when I got to the third section Strength and Stability (32 minutes) that I really experienced pain relief. I had been working in the garden which always triggers back pain for me and did the practice and like magic my pain was relieved. This is a practice I have committed to doing every other day if not every day.

I love that there is no back ground music just Gary's instruction. I love that at the end you can stay in final relaxation as long as you like without interruption. I really love that it has helped my sciatica. It is a practice and must be done on a regular basis, but it is such a pleasure to do and has such great results that I can't wait to get to my mat.",1376265600,2,1598,4.10223642172524
2913188,5,B000U0C9UE,"I bought this as part of my recovery from a bulging disc.  My back was often stiff as a board and I bought this DVD as a source of targeted exercise.

I am thoroughly impressed with this DVD.  The program isn't an insane assortment of poses as I feared- it never asks you to contort your body into a pretzel.  The poses are targeted to increase strength and flexibility and achieves these objectives quite well.  My back felt wonderful after each program, and my range of motion steadily increased as I made this part of my routine.  To clarify, I felt great after each program but the benefits gradually accumulate.

The format is very instructional- clear and to the point.  The DVD does not focus on perfecting each pose.

If you're merely looking for a DVD to increase flexibility in these areas, this DVD is not for you.  It is clearly tailored to those with chronic conditions.",1375747200,4,883,4.56687898089172

After doing the first part of this video, I think it's called stretching, my pain goes from a 7 to a 2 immediately. I notice when I get to the pose that is on the cover of this DVD, something pops right in the area where my pain is. The pain is immediately diminished.

I've been working the tape for about 3 weeks.  there are 3 basic ""workouts"" along with a good amount of explanatory material, and it might be useful to think of them as basic-intermediate-advanced workouts, although that doesn't quite do them justice.  I like the emphasis on understanding the intention of the pose, as I am nowhere near flexible enough to adapt many of the poses presented.  I also appreciate the pacing of the workouts--the first 2 ( I haven't taken on the third yet) leave me feeling a lot better without exhaustion or sweat, and I'm coming from a fairly low level of fitness.

The best thing to say is this--its easy to use and I already feel better.  I recommend it highly and am purchasing the other neck/back/shoulders dvd in the same series.",1373500800,,903,4.677215189873418

2913195,5,B000U0C9UE,"I have never done any yoga in my life. Ever.  At least that is what I thought.  After having several Physical Therapy (PT) visits over the years for my lower back and SI joint, I realized that I probably have been doing some form of yoga for quite some time - since almost all the exercises on this DVD are the ones I did while in PT!!!

I have had years of various types of injections, 2 RFA procedures, SI joint injections, various back tools (brace, tens units), lidocane patches, ibuprofen patches and more types of prescription pills for muscle/skeletal relaxers than I can count and I would still have pain.  It would be so debilitating that I had to begin to walk with a cane.  And I am only 39 years old.  I would get injections every 2-3 months.

It was around the time that I couldn't walk or sit in a chair without pain that I ordered this DVD.  I had gone through more sets of MRIs and other various tests to try to locate the source of my latest pain, which was right before my SI injection and continued for a few weeks AFTER my most recent SI injection.

Then I did this DVD a few times.  And I felt this weird almost like ""pop"" or alignment of some sort. After that - and I am not joking - I was able to walk.  The muscles were tender but I was able to.  After 3 weeks of not walking.  I think I must have misaligned my SI joint attempting to use a sacro wedgy to help take pressure of my joint and lower back. (also purchased on Amazon, and promptly returned) and the DRs were not noticing.  This DVD aligned it.

Now I do the DVD almost every morning. And my muscles feel so good and stretched. So good, in fact, that I have not had to use my prescriptions, I have had no injections for 5 months, and my patches are used only on rare occasions in the evening when I have had an more strenuous than usual day.  I cannot say enough how wonderful I feel after I spend 30 minutes doing this stretching and mild strengthening. I am feeling strong again. I am able to play with my kids again vs being bedridden and having to tell them ""no, mommy's back hurts and I can't play that game with you.""  It has really helped with improving my quality of life.

I know it sounds over the top, but I do feel this has helped me so tremendously. And no, I am not paid to write this review. My co-worker is now using this DVD and I am about to purchase another one for another friend who could benefit from these practices, as well.  Maybe I will feel differently after a while but for 5 months now I am still singing the praises of the DVD.  I have gone some instances where I wouldn't use it for a few days - and then my back would feel tight and I would feel like I need my meds.  But instead I would go back to this DVD and in a day or two it all felt better!",1373241600,14,2764,4.072088724584104

The principles of movement are explained briefly and clearly and I LOVE the way the teacher relieves you of the burden of the ""tyranny of form"" which I've experienced in the past with other yoga teachers.  The question is and should be, is the posture, the way your body can do it, giving you the results you want?  So you don't have to be a perfectionist.  These are realistic postures, done in a sequence, using simple breathwork, and it's not a two-hour ordeal.  I can easily fit these in three or four times a week with no problem.

I have several of Gary Kraftsow's products and they are all organized the same way, which I like because I think it is efficient and effective. I also really appreciate the fact that he has real, normal, and fully/normally clothed (!!) models doing his workouts!

1. Intro overview where he explains the anatomy of the body and the reasons for pain and dysfunction.

2. The 3 sets of exercises. The first two are designed to relieve the pain (one is for hips and low back, and the other for low back and sacrum; you choose which meets your needs, or you can do both) and the 3rd is to maintain strength and flexibility once the pain has abated.

3. The ability to pull the mp3s off the DVD and put onto a smartphone, tablet, mp3 player, CD, etc. I watched until I was comfortable with the poses and now just listen from my smartphone.

I have had to buy this DVD three times because I lend it out and it 'disappears'. I have chronic issues and when I do these exercises regularly, they go away. I like that the sessions are short (20-30 minutes) because any longer aggravates the nerve pain for me. It also makes it easier to fit in to my day.",1367712000,3,1186,4.304932735426009

I like how Gary focuses on the breath (you know exactly when to inhale and exhale, and it DOES make a difference in the quality of the movements).  I like how Gary explains each step of every move, and he repeats himself each time, so there is no way to do the move incorrectly if you are listening.

2913235,5,B000U0C9UE,"Several years ago, I purchased the Viniyoga for the upper body for myself and the Viniyoga for the lower body for my husband.  I ran into a problem with my Sciatic nerve which I had for days and I decided to try the first therapy on the for Viniyoga for the lower body DVD.  The DVD sat there in the family room, unused by my husband. I was amazed!  After performing the therapy, I had absolutely no pain! The pain must have been from a really bad muscle spasm/trigger point deep in the muscles around the sciatic Nerve that the therapy released it.

About a year ago, I ran into a problem with one knee and then, my other knee shortly afterwards.  My doctors recommended Physical Therapy and some drugs.  I went to some PT's which did not help.  I decided to try this DVD again and it provided me relief.  Mentioned it to the PT's but they didn't seem interested in what I had to say.  They just continued to add weights...  I dropped the PT and did the first therapy daily and then much later, performed the second therapy. Over time with performing the therapy on the DVD, my knees were pain free.  If I had continued with the PT sessions, I now know that I would have been destined for knee surgery... on both knees!

What this DVD does is it helps you realign your lower back and hips.  Alignment is critical for your well being and pain relief.  When I even have foot pain, I now know the root of the problem is from above, my hip(s).  This is a great DVD to eliminate pain.  It's not glitzy and can be boring as heck, but it works.  When I get lazy and my lower body starts giving me trouble, I do this DVD.  Do it regularly like you would other tasks in your life like brushing your teeth or exercising.

After my problems were fixed, my husband started doing the first therapy.  It eliminated his lower back issues.  He no longer has to run to use a lower back massage pillow when he gets home from work.  The DVD implies that you should do it first thing in the morning.  We seem to like it before bedtime.  It really relaxes you.  You know you really got the hang of it, if you fall asleep on the floor at the end of the therapy session.  Love it!

One other tip I would like to mention for the Second Therapy.  The Ekapada Ustrasana pose is hard on your knees.  I personally could not do this at the time when I had knee problems.  Instead of doing this on the floor, use a hard chair.  Stand on one foot and put the other foot on a chair with that knee bent at a right angle.  I still prefer doing it this way.

Get this DVD and be patient and do it daily.  Watch the routines/therapies first.  When you have a routine down, really try to breathe correctly and relax when instructed to.  I cannot say enough good things about this DVD.  I'm sure it's saved me a huge amount of money in healing my body and provides maintenance and prevention that is priceless.",1361491200,15,2873,4.2150735294117645

The Viniyoga DVDs from this manufacturer are wonderful for people who suffer from spinal pain.  They are done by physical therapists and are very professional.

I wish my brother would invest in these because he's also had a back problem since an injury in his 20s.

2913250,5,B000U0C9UE,"While trying to walk daily, up and down hills, for a period of time, somehow I herniated a disc in my Lumbar region. I did all of the traditional stuff: anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, and I eventually had to get an epidureal shot in the disc. The PT was not useful since I was physically unable to do all of the strengthening exercises.

A friend of mine told me about this yoga tape featuring Gary Kraftsow - Viniyoga therapy for the lower back, sacrum and hips. Here is the link: Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary Kraftsow  He has 3 segments on this DVD. I did the very first segment which was 'targeted back therapy'. This man's voice is very monotonous but soothing and relaxing to listen to...

When you first turn it on, you wonder to yourself until you start his 23 minute yoga therapy. It is so so gentle and soothing that you feel like you're doing nothing. It gives you a good feeling all over. In part of the DVD, he is silently teaching us how to put the sacrum back into place since it tends to pop out on alot of people.

This DVD so gently works your core as well that it is barely noticeable until you use his DVD a couple of days and then you notice that your stomach is stronger and your posture is better.

He teaches you about back pain and how to address it. This is HANDS DOWN the best product out there for preventing herniated discs and making your abs and back stronger. It does NOT disappoint.
I could not live without this DVD. I am so afraid of losing this DVD or having it break without a replacement that I ordered a second one. If you have real back issues and care about results, you will LOVE this DVD. started this DVD about 5 days ago, and I immediately felt a 'good' feeling afterwards...For some reason, it makes you feel better all around not just the back.

I was looking for something that I could continue to do to build upon the progress I had made in pt.
My problem is the Sacchroiliac joint on the left side of my hip, which was ""sprung"" and needs stretching and strengthening to keep it all pulled together and pain free.

This DVD has been so helpful.  They are basically the same stretches I was doing in pt, but in a nice flow that makes it easy to do them all.  I do each of the three sessions in rotation, one each day. The very first time I did one of the workouts, I felt improvement. The positions are doable, even for this 57 yr old.  Each one is only 30 minutes long, which makes it easy to fit into my day.

Once I started this program I had consistent progress, I began sleeping through the night more often, whereas before, my hip pain would wake me up several times.

Mr. Kraftsow leads you through easy to follow instructions, conducted at a slow pace and with deep orchestrated breathing, making the exercise totally conscious, as opposed to wrote and boring. The movements are paced well and Mr. Kraftsow is obviously an expert at the techniques he provides. The movements are clearly demonstrated by one of Mr. Kraftsow's students as he narrates with a voice over. So all you have to do is watch and listen while you perform the movements.

I do them several times a week. It's not that my SI joint problem has gone away; I think what's happening since I'm doing these exercises is that the muscles supporting the SI joint are doing a better job. The exercises are simple, but it took me 2-3 weeks to work up to being able to do the exercises regularly, and then a couple weeks for me to start feeling the results. So don't give up if pain doesn't disappear right away. Do what you can and build up slowly if you need to. It worked for me.",1348963200,8,813,4.119496855345912
2913285,5,B000U0C9UE,"I love this video. As mentioned before it is no frills- but gets to the meat of what is necessary to get your back functioning again....I have been suffering from sciatica the last 2 weeks. It is a chronic condition which had not acted up in awhile but now did after picking up heavy bags. Thus, I am starting easy with just the Low back therapy section.  If I had been doing these all along I may not have to be dealing with the pain now but I am not the most disciplined person! Anyhow, when I start the exercises I feel some achiness,  but after a while of continuing to do them-nice and easy and gently-then by the end of the sequence I am pain free-at least for a bunch of hrs.! Doing them twice a day helps me get through the day with much less pain than when I don't do the exercises. He is a very good teacher walking you slowly through each exercise and instructing you on the in and out breath (something extremely impt. which many videos do not). I am in my 50s but quite fit and this is not a show of yoga 'acrobatics' but real healing poses to help one to strenghten and heal one's back. Of course, a holistic program for full healing should also involve proper diet (including keeping your colon clean!!), occasional chiropractic adjustments,occasional Castor oil packs, and occasional acupuncture treatments. I also have 2 herniated disks in my lower back and this is what has helped me....Yes, it is some work but I prefer this than to getting cut up and patched up- which often leaves people in worst shape than when they started....At least, that is what I have observed.  I highly recommend this video!!",1344988800,3,1622,4.436241610738255
2913286,5,B000U0C9UE,"As I have grown older (53), my lower back seems to have gotten weaker despite getting regular exercise and carrying a very ideal weight.  I love gardening, but each year I seem to injure my back which takes longer to recuperate with each episode.  This last injury took over 3 weeks before I felt like I could bend over without the risk of setting off a spasm.  Out of desperation and a bit of depression that I might have to quit gardening, I decided to see if there was anything I could do to speed up the recovery time as well as prevent injuries from recurring.  I read so many reviews on books and DVDs on back health and ended up with this video, ""Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum and Hips.""

Gary Kraftsow's DVD has been wonderful.  The exercises seem simple at first glance, but as you actually perform them while you are still in some kind of pain which he says is okay in most cases, you can sense all the muscles involved with each exercise.  I was amazed that none of the exercises created any additional pain--just the awareness of where the injury was. The key is to really take your time, practice the breathing simultaneously and go at your own pace with each exercise.

I made the commitment to watch the video each day and do all the exercises from the first section on Low Back.  It was so noticeable how it set the tone for the rest of my physical day.  As most people will notice, doing these in the morning seems to be the toughest as the body is still stiff from sleep--even more reason to start the day doing the exercises.  But, I also do them at night as well and notice I am less stiff in the morning.

I have moved on to the second section on Sacrum and Hips and was initially surprised to discover the restriction in these areas of my body as well.  This is when you realize how many muscle groups are connected and responsible for an area of weakness or an injury.  I look forward to doing the more advanced exercises in the last section in the very near future.

I doubt anyone will find that this video does not give them a sense of hope and relief from their back pain, weakness and stiffness.  It is a pleasure to see something so simple can be so helpful.  I highly recommend this DVD either to get through an injury and/or as a maintenance plan for the rest of your life if you have any tendency towards back pain and discomfort.",1342483200,7,2374,4.3108108108108105

2913298,5,B000U0C9UE,"I have used this program successfully for several years now. I have two herniated discs in my lower back that initially caused me tremendous pain, and kept me from working for 7 weeks. In fact, I was unable to walk or use my left leg for several weeks, before graduating to a walker, and then to a cane, before resuming more or less a normal routine after several months passed, though pain persisted for a long time. I believe this program has kept me from having surgery, and has enabled me to live a normal life, including yard-work and golf, as long as I am conscientious with the routines.

Here's what I love about the program:

1. While I respect and appreciate yoga practice, I'm really not interested in the new-agey apparatus that comes with it. There's none of that here -- Kraftsow is very straight-forward and matter of fact. I guess some call him dry, but I think he's actually fantastic -- relaxing and informative, without any yelling, linking yogic practice with understanding of anatomy.
2. He clearly lays out the practical foundations for the program in an introductory lecture. It's not at all necessary to watch it, but it's worth watching if you have a mind to. It's unfortunate that the version of the DVD I have seems to run directly to the lecture, instead of to a main menu where you can pick what you want.
3. The exercises themselves are obviously great. The first one, for the sacrum and lower back, takes about 23 minutes, and can be done essentially in bed -- there are no standing postures, and not much in the way of sitting or kneeling. It's something you can do when you have a flare-up and need to take remedial steps. Once you've progressed, you can do program 3, the overall preventative or maintenance program. Program 2 is remedial action for hips, so do that instead of 1 if you need help with your hips instead of your lower back.
4. What's clever about the exercises is the sequence in which he arranges them, with alternating contracting and expanding of the same areas, before moving on to stretching and strengthening. Relief is almost immediate, for me at least.
5. The workouts are available as audio files on the disc, so you can copy them to iTunes or whatever, for increased portability and convenience.

The only negative for me here is that I think the DVD could be arranged a little better.

Essentially, this DVD has been a real game-changer for me, over a long period of time. It works. If you have lower back pain and are a candidate for yoga therapy and your doctor says go for it, this program works.",1338336000,12,2560,4.570806100217865

I've been battling my chronic lower back pain for years.  It's been so bad recently i was afraid of doing anything that will make the pain worse.  I'm an active 45 year old woman.  When just 3 mile run would put me into excruciating pain for days, I knew I had to do something about it before it is too late.  I've purchased Gaiam yoga for lower back DVD of Rodney Yee's first, but it wasn't right.  The dvd would play same 5 postures over and over again.  There was no instructions or anything, just Rodney Yee doing the postures on the beach with a chair.  What a waste of money!!  Don't buy any of that crap unless you buy it on Gaiam's website at full price.  What you are buying might be crappy copy version.
Then I found Viniyoga Therapy for the low back, sacrum & hips on amazon, and the reviews were so wonderful that I had to give it a try.  I'm a believer already after the first practice!!!  I'm so looking forward to practicing everyday, and being free of pain.  I highly recommend listening to what Gary Kraftsow have to say in the beginning.  It gave me a great understanding of my back pain.  Watching the technique workshop before the practice is helpful as well.  You really want to do the every move correctly to maximize the impact.

2913319,4,B000U0C9UE,"So after a few years of working out and doing yoga religiously, my circumstances changed and I couldn't go to the gym anymore.  You'd be surprised to know how quickly your hard won fitness goes spiraling down the toilet once you stop exercising.

  Anyhow, I'm one of those lucky apple-shaped chicks with a long torso, big chest, and no butt to serve as a counterbalance.  Thus, I'm not really just top heavy, I'm ""front"" heavy which leaves my poor spine with the daunting task of keeping me upright.  Anyway, the last couple months have been agony. I've been having trouble sleeping, getting out of bed and even standing up. I'm only 30 for god sakes, so I decided I was going on a crusade to put an end to this pain. Ordering this DVD seemed like a good start.

  If you are looking for a gentle, therapeutic series of exercises to address your lower back pain, considering purchasing this DVD. Although Gary Kraftsow uses the official sanskrit names of various poses, you do NOT have to be familiar with yoga to follow along.  In fact, if I were him I'd consider lopping ""viniyoga"" off the title because it's probably scaring away people who would greatly benefit from this video.

  The DVD gives you a choice of three practices, which are between 25 and 30 mins long.  One focuses on the low back/sacrum, one focuses on the hips, and the last is a combination and supposed to be a bit more difficult.  I've done all three, and they are great, but please be aware that they are truly boring and redundant.  Strength training is all about reps, and that is what you're doing here.  The sequence of the exercises is well thought out - once you become accustomed to moving a certain way, you'll switch to an exercise that does just the opposite. It works, though.  Afterwards I really did notice a difference in my posture, and after a week my back pain has decreased.

  If you are an experienced yogi with tight hips just looking to improve your flexibility, this DVD is NOT for you.  This is intended for people in pain, and you will be bored out of your mind.

  **** One last word of caution - each practice ends with Savasna (or Corpse Pose) which entails laying flat on your back for a few minutes.  I was really surprised he included that without modifcation as this can really aggravate back pain. So if it's too much for you, try bending your knees or leaning your legs up against a wall for the duration of the pose.",1325030400,40,2428,4.486301369863014

2913322,5,B000U0C9UE,"A good friend of mine used me in a case study when she was working towards certification in viniyoga with Gary Kraftsow himself. This isn't standard yoga. And this DVD isn't standard issue either.

First, it's not set on a cheesy Hawaiian beach. (It's in a studio with a Kraftsow's voice over.) Second, you actually can move through the postures without watching every move on the TV. Conceivably, I'll be able to do this practice effectively even while on the road. That's part of why I give it five stars.

I've practiced yoga off and on for years in just about every possible setting, and I have a pile (a pile!) of dusty DVDs, too. When I was introduced to viniyoga a year ago, I confess it really didn't feel like yoga to me. My friend explained that it was good therapy for my condition -  a nagging SI Joint issue.

I returned to viniyoga by purchasing this DVD at the same friend's suggestion two weeks ago. I have been suffering from extreme tightness in my low back and hips and (perhaps) a slightly torn disc. I can feel a marked difference in my low back. And that's the other reason I give it five stars.

I'm on a mission to return to running, and it's my belief viniyoga practiced regularly will help me achieve that by helping ease the muscle imbalances that have occurred for me after six years of committed long distance running.

Though the practice for low back is just 23 minutes long, I believe it has and will continue to make a difference for my health and activity level. I will, I'm sure, be working up to longer practices, but for now low back and hips is a bit too much for me, so I'm alternating and practicing almost every day.

Of all the yoga DVDs I've bought and been given, this is hands down the best, and I'm pretty picky about yoga.",1321747200,5,1769,4.391437308868501

I started physical therapy about 4 months ago and have finally found some relief.  I figured I'd try this yoga DVD to enhance my PT regime...it was something I could do at home and didn't take too much time.  I noticed the DVD basically incorporated almost all of the exercises my therapist has me doing at home already.  I LOVE this video!!  The only down side, and it is a big downside to be honest, it is boring...I completely agree with the other reviewers!  There is no music and Gary's voice is very monotone.  But even so, I would not give this video anything less than 5 stars because it has truly helped me!!  I'm extremely thankful for this video and use it almost daily to stretch these specific areas.  I also brought it in to show both my doctor and therapist and they didn't realize it existed.  My doctor has added it to her reference material for her other patients.

2913327,5,B000U0C9UE,"A little background of myself - pain sufferer for past 12 years with dx - ankylosing spondylitis (and sacro-ilitis) and fibromyalgia and adrenal insufficiency and low thyroid.

I choose my exerices carefully. Let me tell you this is of much importance than losing weight alone. If you do not enjoy what you do and you are in pain, your body will get stressed and that will affect the adrenals. For me intense cardio was never an option. I used to walk my dogs 5 miles and then ended up lying down with so much fatigue and yes, pain. Strength training helps but doing yoga advanced stretched with your own weight works more effeciently to use your own muscles.

I was looking for exercise DVDS and i saw this DVD for lower body - yes the positive reviews made me buy immediately but also the fact that yoga had helped me so much to be fit when i was young. so i thought why not emulate what i did in  my teen years - tennis and yoga - made me happy and i started this regimen with the help of this DVD.

About this DVD itself - the author's voice is very soft that it CAN irritate you. Also many yoga masters or new agey people i have seen have the tendency to use false calm voice to make a point, don't have to, any ways.. If you get past this nonsense, you will find this DVD GREAT. I was in so much pain a couple of months back that i started chiropractic therpay, nothing nothing worked, so i started to do this yoga DAILY. This DVD has 3 parts, i suggest you doing 1 and 2 daily for atleat a month till you feel flexible.

My pain is amazingly NIL, yes NIL without any other change. All i take is supplementation of Vit D3, B complex and magnesium chelate. Please TRY even if its boring to hear the voice or the slowness as opposed to a jillian micheals DVD or Tony (beachbody). Focus just on how these movements change the entire muscle memory, you will feel fantastic. For me practicing these yoga poses is much like breathing now - i don't think i want to stop ever to feel that pain again.

Also note many stretches in beachbody DVD and many other exercise DVDs incorporate the same stretch as in this yoga dvd - sometimes i feel stretching and yoga can be interchanged but with the deeper understandong of mind body breath connection in yoga

I got myself the upper body yoga of Gary Kraftsow as a gift though i have not used it daily as the lower body yoga.

Hope this review helps someone in pain which had been a normal part of me for years.",1318550400,18,2454,4.23982869379015

to be helpful. I haven't done much yoga, but I started with the Hip Therapy section
and it is gentle and seems to straighten my hips out. I did run into problems doing
the modified ""superman"" parts - arms and legs lifted together. It made all of my rib
muscles tight and pulled on my back/pelvis making things worse. So, I just don't do
those parts and the rest is fine. I actually felt it helping the first time i watched it. The introduction is worth watching too - has a lot of invaluable advice to incorporate before doing the techniques.

I love how it focuses on the science of the yoga positions to attain the goal you desire. This is not an exercise dvd (thankfully because I am still so out of shape).

I do ultrasound and had severe pain on the right from my back through shoulder and arm.  I have found much relief if I consistently do at least a 20 minute segment.  I alternate and many of the exercises are similar in both with some more specific to the upper or lower.  What I like is that he prompts every move including breathing and the movement.  The movements are slow so I can keep up with them. One would think that slow doesn't work but I'm starting to feel more flexibility and less pain in all areas of my back and I'm seeing more definition in my stomach muscles.  I like variety so having the 2 DVDs with 3 sessions in each is good although many of the movements are similar.  There is also a segment that describes each movement and proper position.

2913354,3,B000U0C9UE,"I bought this DVD in 2008, and have tried it from time to time as my physical circumstances have changed. I bought this based on the wonderful reviews, and the fact that it was therapy for the low back, sacrum, and hips. I was in 2 bad car accidents in my 20's, and fractured my spine 6 years ago when I wiped out after hitting a patch of wet mud while biking. The result, after I'd healed enough to move around, was that I was left with considerable chronic pain in my lower back, and if I walk for any time at all, my hips get very painful. Prior to the accident I walked 7 miles per day, and rode my bike 10. Afterwards, I found myself unable to do any real exercise at all - not wanting to let my physical condition continue to deteriorate, I was looking for a gentle form of exercise.

Some forms of yoga have been great when I was in good shape, so I thought I'd give Viniyoga a try 6 months after the accident. What I found was that it caused me more pain in my lower back, and I felt as though my muscles went into spasm that lasted quite a long time. Instead of opening up my hips or pelvis area, I felt more locked up. I do have to say that if my injuries hadn't been as severe, this DVD has real potential - so I'll keep it, hoping I'll get to the point where I can use it.

A little more than a year after the accident, and some physical therapy behind me, I tried again. This time I still found my back hurt while doing the workout, esp the exercises done while lying on my back. I've decided to wait awhile, try a little more therapy before doing Viniyoga. I also had my physical therapist look at the video, and he felt it was good, and well worth hanging onto for use further down the road.

I definately don't want to give up on this program because I do think it's a very good program, but I did want to review this for people who might find themselves in a similar position. Both to let them know it's a good program, and not to give up if it's painful at first.

What this program offers which others I've looked at don't, is a really good understanding of how yoga can be utilized to stregthen the back, and get it back in condition. An excellent presentation on how to perform the various postures. And then the postures/exercises are broken down into different segments based on the areas one might need to concentrate on the most. For example, after so much time w/o any significant exercise, I very much need to stregthen my core, especially my lower abdomen, and all of my back muscles. When I exercise my back now it goes into spasm - which is pretty excrutiating - ever get a foot cramp? LOL Imagine that in your back, and I can't get out of it myself! Yikes it hurts!

Anyway, I know this is a DVD I'll hang on to until I can do exercises w/o inducing more pain. And, until then, I wanted to suggest an alternative for those who find themselves in the same position I'm in, as well as those who would like an excellent core training DVD - the only one I've found that I can do at this point. It was suggested by a friend who's a pilates instructor, and it's the one DVD I'm finding offers significant healing from my injury. It's called Core Training for Belly Dancers by Gerson Kuhr ... he goes by another name based on a show he was in, but it escapes me at present - you can ck out the link if you're interested.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Core-Training-for-Belly-Dancers/dp/B000I6AHTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Core Training for Belly Dancers</a>

2913373,5,B000U0C9UE,"First, always watch this or any yoga or exercise DVD at least one time BEFORE doing the exercises. Determine if any of the exercises might hurt you or if you need to modify. While modifications are not given, you can figure out your own. Moreover, there are few stretches here (and I call them that because they're not at all strenuous) that would be hard for too many people. Certainly some of us, myself included, can't put our legs straight up with no bend in the knee. But we must go only to our own degree. Never push beyond what you're able to do. You get no benefit doing that.

These are short therapeutic exercises --- from twenty to thirty minutes each. They provide much relief from pain and are designed in a manner that works. What's more, there is a lot of information given on the DVD, including instructions on how to do each exercise. I advise you to watch every bit of it.

I have a wonderful book on the anatomy of stretching and it includes working on the lower back and hips. You might want to read about it here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stretching-Anatomy/dp/0736059725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stretching Anatomy</a>. And you might want to add it to your arsenal of help. But, getting back to this DVD, I find that while it doesn't cover all the stretches in the above-mentioned book, it is a wonderful way to relieve any pain you may have, regardless of how bad it might be. Moreover, if you don't do something to work on those painful areas, you could end up not being able to get around at all.

I was having moderate to severe pain in my lower back and hip and this DVD was of tremendous help to me.

I highly advise anyone with problems or pain in the lower back or hips to get this DVD. It's excellent therapy that anyone can apply and it's superior to most of the yoga videos I've seen.

After a recent day of golf, I experienced what felt like beginning sciatica (YIKES!) and I decided to get aggressive.

I bought two DVDs, one for building back strength (this one), the other primarily for flexibility (Yoga Therapy for Back Pain). I've used them interchangeably for about 4 weeks now, a period which included extensive travel. Numbness is mostly gone and overall flexibility noticeably improved. Lower back pain, which has been a minor but nagging issue, is almost all gone.

This DVD offers multiple options, which is nice, and the narrator does a nice job guiding you through the postures and breathing. The narrator isn't Rodney Yee voice-wise, but the voice is OK and keeps your attention.

Just pop the DVD in, and you'll find the video divided up into some of these sections, such as...

-Presentation on Understanding Back Pain and the application of yoga therapy.
-Technique Workshop on how to safely perform postures and movements.
-Focused practice for Low Back and Sacrum Therapy.
-Focused practice for Hip Therapy.
-Integrated practice for sustained low back Strength and Stability.

Its set up pretty well. In a nutshell, they cover some facts about back pain, and then introduce you to the theory of yoga and some of the postures. Then, you can pick which area you want to focus on (like the low back), and you'll be slowly guided through a series of poses that will help get you stretched out and strengthened up. If you're worried about getting injured or hurt, don't be. All the poses are pretty gentle, and the stretches can be as mild as you want them to be. And the music and verbal instructions are quite soothing. So if you think you'd like to try yoga to take a bite out of your back pain, this would be a good choice.",1274400000,265,1569,5.616033755274262

2913382,4,B000U0C9UE,"Hey everyone!

I am a 23 year old male - in NYC. Recently i had a tumble down the stairs and felt a sharp tear in my back - no idea what it was. I kept staying active running about 4-5 miles every weekend. Then all of a sudden i knew something was wrong - the ligaments were already overstretched and to add salt to injury i did even more damage.

Overall i think this product is great - use caution when doing the exercises esp depending on the severity of your injury. Cut down on reps if you have to. And i would also recommend Tom Bisio's ""A tooth from the tigers mouth"" he has some great exercises and medicines for sports injuries. Together with these two inshaAllah im on the course of a full recovery and getting back to running and weightlifting.

2913383,5,B000U0C9UE,"I would highly recommend Kraftsow's programs for helping with back and hip pain. It's a very gentle routine designed to stretch out the lower back and hips. Most stretches are seated, and the flow always feel just right...if you stretch in a back bend, the next exercise will be a forward bend. A little boring if you do it every day, but worth the time and effort to help ease an injured back. I wish Kraftsow did a full body yoga routine, but putting the lower body DVD with the upper back and shoulder one achieves something close. Five stars all the way.",1271548800,3,558,4.427184466019417

The instructor has excellent credentials, and even includes some great general information about back and hip pain if you're interested.
He can be a bit boring, but it's all good stuff to know if you don't already.
The exercise segments, though they may seem easy to some, are good for people who really have bad back problems and need to start off with a good baseline to start becoming more flexible in the spine and strengthening the muscles w/o injury.
The sessions are just as manageable as PT sessions--not much over 25 minutes each, and you can do all three if you want.  They're divided up into which area you would like to work on.",1266624000,3,748,4.533333333333333

It's very helpful to have exercises that specifically target a problem area.  The pain was gone in less than a week of doing the exercises daily.  Fantastic DVD!",1261440000,7,336,4.859649122807017
2913388,4,B000U0C9UE,"I decided to buy this DVD on impulse after my long-term back trouble reared its head again. If you've had back trouble in the past and have seen a physical therapist, or if you've taken a beginning yoga class, all of the exercises presented here will be familiar to you. I fall into this camp myself, and was a bit disappointed at first not to have discovered something new which would finally ""solve"" my problem.

But I did the exercises, and, after about a week and a half, things began to ease up and re-align. The moral of the story is that while this video contains nothing new under the sun, it is an extremely well-presented, focused series of yoga practices. If your back, or more specifically, in my case, your sacroiliac joint is giving you fits, this will help. If your back is a trouble-maker, the moral of the story is to do the exercises regularly as prevention. Don't stop when you feel better, but make the practice a habit.

One last thing I'd like to add is that if your back is hurting, do the exercises very slowly and mindfully to see which movements cause pain and which relieve pain. This can help identify where the underlying cause is for your back trouble. For example, a tight right hamstring can make your left low back ache. The problem isn't always where you think it may be. Also pay attention to walking, and especially how you stand up from a chair or get out of your car. Chances are you have some bad movement habits that trace back to old injuries, like me.",1259625600,23,1493,4.445255474452555
2913389,3,B000U0C9UE,"I'm not a yoga follower but was simply looking for a DVD to help with lower back and hip pain.  I have a posterior innominate rotation on the left (diagnosed in 1997) and hip dysplasia on the right. I also recently started physical therapy for knee pain (suluxated patellas - worse on the left), as well as the other issues.  In the past, a mix of back extension work and abs had really helped with my hip pain, but was not sufficient this time around.  So, based on reviews, I purchased this DVD. I have only used the first lower back routine on the DVD.

Before I get into the review, I just want to add a caution for those that are not currently doing yoga, even if you are doing other Core exercises, you may want to break the workouts into sections.  The first time I did the lower back routine I did the entire segment and was rewarded about an hour later with intense pain accross both hips and lower back that lasted for several days.  This did not impact my review of the DVD, though, as I figured it was just too much, too soon.  So, after that I initially did the first half of this practice and then slowly added on through to the end.

When my knee problems started I purchased this DVD and a knee DVD to see if I could improve the situation on my own.  I made a lot of progress but then over vacation re-injured my knee so started on physical therapy.  I continued to do the exercises from this DVD during my first 6 weeks of PT.  I did have some improvements in my lower back pain and stiffness, but this did nothing to help stabilize my rotation.  Also, as mentioned in a previous review, there is quite a bit in this DVD to bother the knees.  After re-injuring my knee I was forced to drop all Bridge exercises from this routine (oddly enough I can do a bridge with my feet on a chair and now do a single leg version of these).  Also, I ended up dropping the Supta Padangusthasana as the bending and straightening of the knee was also a problem, and to be honest it only provided a very weak hamstring stretch. If it were only the problems with my knees, I would probably have given the DVD a better score, but even when doing the full version of the workout it didn't provide any stability and only helped my lower back a little.

For stablizing my hips and lower back rotation, my physical therapy has taken me in a completely different direction than this DVD.  I found I was very weak in my gluteus medius so my physical therapy focused on that (clams with resistance, abductor leg lifts with ankle weights, leg circles), as well as moving to the single-legged version of the bridge on a chair. After a few weeks we also added forearm planks and side planks.  Also, I continue to do ab exercises and have increased the intensity (I love the Pure Core routine from the Core Fusion Pilates Plus DVD).  I have found that the combination of exercises from physical therapy and my own ab routines have done a lot more for me than this exercise DVD has.  I have viewed the other two routines on the DVD, and don't think that either would be as efficient as what I am doing now, and would hurt my knee. My rotation has now stablized and although I'm still working through issues with some hip pain, my lower back pain is gone.  I found I was getting more and more bored with the routine from this DVD, and I really didn't want to devote over 20 minutes for just my lower back and then still have to do glutes and abs, so decided to eliminate the DVD workout. I did take from it the 4 versions of back extensions from the three routines, making a note of the timing used for each.  I also continue to do cakravakasana variations.  I can complete my lower back routine each day in less than 5 minutes and so it fits better with all the other exercise I do.

I realize that I have some specific issues so this impacts my review of the DVD, but regardless I think the routines are too long and don't include the abs and very little for the gluteus medius.  Also, just found it really boring after a while.  So, it's just not for me. I may pull it out from time to time for a lighter lower back workout as I did a few days ago, but I do not see this continuing as a daily practice. If you simply have problems with lower back pain/stiffness but no mechanical issues then this DVD would probably provide a perfect workout for you.",1259366400,20,4338,4.254567600487211

2913393,5,B000U0C9UE,"My wife bought me this DVD last Christmas but I was skeptical and my back was in too much spasm for me to consider it. I was also skeptical of chiropractic having been treated for over 4 years in the past with only short-term benefits. Since beginning NUCCA chiropractic therapy I have found a great deal of relief, enough to convince me to let go of my skepticism of yoga as well.

I am totally new to yoga, with 10 years of Army physical training beind me I typically seek out more aggressive approaches but I am finally recognizing that wasn't getting me the relief I really needed. In the past few days I finally started using this video, and this morning before writing this review was my first time through an exercise routine. It's a great video and good exercise program!

I started a few days ago with the Technique Workshop, where he talked through a demonstration of each technique in vivid detail. Yesterday I reviewed the workshop to be sure I was familiar with the movements, and this morning I moved right into the most strenuous of the 3 Therapeutic Practices - Strength and Stability.

This 32 minute routine takes you through a series of 17 relaxing but effective exercises and stretches. I'm in reasonably good fitness (I've been out of the Army 10 years now but still relatively active) but found it challenging at times to maintain the slow controlled breathing while doing these focused movements. By the end of the routine I really enjoyed the Savasana (deep relaxation) pose he leaves you with, spending about 5 minutes of deep breathing and relaxing before starting my day.

I definitely recommend this to anyone struggling with chronic back pain, and although I never tried it I believe his approach is gentle enough to try even while you are suffering from spasms. I like his staged approach and expect that, should I have another painful episode of back spasm, I should be able to use his other two Therapeutic Practice sessions - Low Back Therapy and Hip Therapy.",1254182400,8,1992,4.699140401146132

When he directs moves during the exercise portion, his descriptions of the moves and calming voice help with concentration and effectiveness of the moves. Highly recommended!

Very tiring!). After months of tests and visits to specialists I had a diagnosis but no treatment plan. In desperation, I searched the web for physical therapy exercises and bought this DVD. Within a couple of days I was feeling much better and now, after 2 weeks or so, the pain is almost gone (I've also been getting acupuncture 1-2 times/week). Whenever the pain returns, I do a 30-minute routine and it pretty much disappears. I stress (along with other reviewers) that you must commit to doing these exercises EVERY DAY in the beginning.

(I've been seeing a chiropractor off and on for almost 3 years, and I was in mild to medium pain 24/7). I then started doing the 31 minute hips section and that was great as well and alleviated some other pain I'd been having. You DO need to keep doing it everyday, and I've only had this for a month, but soon I'll move on to the 32 minute maintenance section. The moves are very mild and simple and there is a section that explains the moves if you aren't sure exactly how to do it. There is also a lecture by the creator of this which some might find helpful. I HIGHLY recommend if you are not finding relief with other therapies.",1247011200,66,805,4.166666666666667
2913398,5,B000U0C9UE,"I went ahead and purchased both the upper and lower body videos, even though one reviewer (on another site) commented that the two videos share the same exercise routines and felt it was a waste of his money. According to my chiropractor, and Gary Kraftsow, the order in which the exercises are performed play a key part in helping certain areas of the body so while the moves may appear to be the same, they are in fact, working differently.

I also opted for this series over the many yoga videos offered for its ""therapeutic"" possibilities. What I like about this series is that each movement is repeated several times, as one would expect, had they gone to a personal trainer or therapist. Movements aren't rushed and hurried, in order to accomplish some goal of showing off how many complicated yoga moves can be done in one hour, but are done with the intent of actually helping the body realign and heal itself.

Another thing I like about the series is that it is very direct and to the point. There aren't any side jokes that will get annoying over time, there aren't any beginner comments made during the actual practices, and there is no background music.

I can add my own music, via a CD or MP3 player, and change it up a bit so that I am not easily bored. When I forget why I should do a certain move, I can go back to the training section, and when I want to remember why these moves are important to my body, I can go to the ""Understanding"" section. There are also three segments which increase in time so I can change things up a tad.",1246838400,2,1551,4.378472222222222

The usual diagnosis is a doctor's visit followed by a prescription of physical therapy.  A little expensive even with co-pay.  We decided to try this dvd since it raves about dealing with lower back pain: not only was it gentle and specific to the area of pain (you can choose one of three sections to work on - lower back, hips and strength training,  All fully explained with another section showing you techniques if you are not familiar with yoga type moves.  Gary Kraftsow also spends 20+ minutes going over causes of back pain, it is not a substitute to a doctor's visit, but self education goes a long way.  We supplement this dvd with some physical therapy sessions (to tell you the truth - there is not much difference in the exercises).

2913408,5,B000U0C9UE,"I wanted to get a good viniyoga tape ever since the early 70s when, as a boy, I suffered a lower back injury in France, when I was pushed out of a slowly moving bus by some schoolmates.

Ever since then I have moved more slowly than my contemporaries, but just like the tortoise overtaking the hare, I have found Gary Kraftsow's slow, deliberate yoga teaching a clear case of therapy.  I wasn't looking for an instant cure!  Just a way for me to intake the knowledge of the viniyoga into my sacrum and lower back, let alone my hips, just as once I looked up at the low hanging French sky, on my back, in a crowded avenue, while my schoolbus shot off without me, and French boys were laughing at me through the still flapping backdoor of the bus, and my whole body irradiuated with pain.  Kraftsow isn't a comedian like so many other yoga ""entertainers"" and he seems to want to educate the viewer into going along with a slow-paced regimen, nothing flashy, just good old fashioned poses and a l-o-t of stretching of tight tendons.  Deep in the sacrum, where a bewildering variety of muscles come together in confusing interstitial junctions, the pain gremlins shriek in fright when they hear Gary Kraftsow's relaxing voice boom out changes with his trademark conviction.  The guy really believes in what he's doing, and when I'm watching this on my wide screen TV in my sunroom, I occasionally take a break and write him a little personal note of thanks, mailing it off to his atelier with name and address attached.  In France my teachers at the lycee, when I confronted them with evidence of anti-US bullying, told me to ask not the question, but to ask instead the answer.

2913409,3,B000U0C9UE,"I purchased both the low and upper back dvds to supplement my current yoga practice because I've been finding it harder to get to the studio on a regular basis. I practice yin for the tightness in my low back and hips and thought that I could combine the three practices on this dvd into a solid 90 minute class.

Unfortunately, what one reviewer said about each practice being basically the same is very true. One would expect that targeting each ""area"" would involve the use of DIFFERENT postures, but each practice is, in fact, almost exactly the same with only slight variation in poses, sequencing and repetition. Plus, some of the postures are repeated so frequently that combining all three practices would exhaust the areas they are meant to target. (e.g., bridge pose)

However, I still give the dvd three stars because, in my opinion, Kraftsow's cuing is effective and purpose behind the dvd is a good one. This dvd would be suitable for a deconditioned person, someone never having practiced yoga, or someone recovering from a back injury (with the exception of the numerous reps in bridge pose.) The lectures at the beginning of the dvd are useful for the uninitiated and Kraftsow uses the Sanskrit names of postures, which is refreshing. However, if you have an ongoing, serious practice, this dvd will be frustrating, boring and useless.

I'm probably going to wind up selling both the upper and lower back dvds, or at least returning the upper back one, as I'm expecting it to be similar in style and sequencing.",1234224000,21,1527,4.798479087452471

After several people suggested yoga to deal with my back pain, I caved in and bought some DVDs.  One I bought was something like ""yoga for the rest of us"" or something like that, and I found it to be much too difficult and awkward.  Still, I persisted.

I ended up with this DVD and found it to be absolutely perfect for me.  It does not put undue strain anywhere and I always always feel better when I do it.  One of the routines is only 23 minutes so that also encourages me to do it.  Perhaps it would be too easy for people who are more inclined towards yoga - I'm not sure.  But for me - someone who has back pain and needed a short routine to feel better, this is the DVD for me.  I even brought it to South America with me on vacation and did it while I was there in order to combat the effect of being on my feet so many hours a day.",1229644800,6,1138,3.995575221238938
2913413,5,B000U0C9UE,"This is an extremely professional high quality DVD by Gary Kraftsow, one of the world's leading yoga therapy experts with over 30 years experience, who designed the yoga therapy protocol used in the National Institutes of Health Study that successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of yoga therapy for relieving back pain.  Results of this groundbreaking study were published in the Annals of Internal Medicine back in 2005.

Gary now provides the protocols used in the study in this highly educational instructional DVD - a gift for anyone who has ever struggled with low back pain. The DVD has four main chapters:

1.  Understanding Back Pain

The first chapter is an in-depth academic presentation about back pain that includes discussion about types of back pain, causes of back pain, an introduction to back, sacrum, and hip anatomy, and basic biomechanics. He then briefly discuss what yoga is and the goals of the yoga therapy for back pain DVD - to reduce pain, increase circulation, improve function, and increase overall sense of well being.  While a bit clinical, this is important information for increasing our awareness about the back, its structure, how it works, and what we can do to care for it.

2. Techniques Workshop

In the second chapter, Gary explains each posture (exercise) performed in the therapeutic practices chapter including instructions for how to breathe, how to move, and what sensations to expect.  A model demonstrates each posture while Gary explains what is happening in the pose and why it is beneficial.

3. Therapeutic Practices

Three therapeutic practices are provided in Chapter 3, as well as guidelines for how to use the practices.  The first practice is a 23-minute series of postures designed to rehabilitate the low back and sacrum.  All the poses are done on the floor, either on your back, belly, or hands and knees.  These are very basic poses that focus on slow repetition.

The second therapeutic practice is a 31-minute series that focuses on stretching, strengthening, and balancing the hips.  Many of the poses from the first practice are repeated here, with additional poses specifically for the hips.

The third practice builds upon the first two.  It is a stronger practice designed to build sustained low back, sacrum, and hip health.  Several basic standing poses are included in addition to the poses done on the stomach and back.

Viniyoga Therapy for low back, sacrum, and hips is a serious DVD designed to address a serious problem - low back pain.  Anyone who has ever suffered from low back pain knows just how debilitating it can be.

I turned to yoga more than a decade ago seeking relief from sciatica and back pain. Although Viniyoga teachers are not that common where I live, I had the opportunity to take several classes from a teacher who had studied with Gary.  The focus on function over form and repetitive movements brought immediate relief not experienced with other styles of yoga.

The set is uncluttered and simple - just a single model demonstrating the routines, while Gary provides expert voiced over instruction.  His delivery is calm and monotone.  There is no music to distract you from concentrating and paying attention to what you are doing - one of the tenants of Viniyoga Therapy.

If you suffer from low back pain and are in the market for a Yoga DVD containing therapeutic yoga practices with proven success in helping relieve back pain you may want to consider investing in Viniyoga Therapy for Low Back, Sacrum, and Hips.

2913415,5,B000U0C9UE,"I've been doing yoga for several years, but specifically the last year for my lower back.  When I'm not doing the poses given by my physical therapist twice a day, I have preferred Rodney Yee--especially ""For Back Care.""

This DVD is excellent.  His lecture at the beginning is very thorough, although a bit akward.  However, the verbal instructions for the exercises are excellent.  There were not many new poses for me here, but excellent variations and more repetitions than I was doing.  I could feel the difference.  The mp3 versions are also a nice touch--saves me a step to get it on my ipod for traveling.

I have only done the ""Low Back and Sacrum,""  but this will be a daily staple.  After a century (100 mile bike ride) weekend before last, the chirporactor didn't quite get my back in place.  I can already feel the difference from one workout.

This is excellent for beginners because it is very slow moving and gentle.  At the top of the screen, you always have the option to click for more specific instructions on each pose.",1224633600,14,1040,4.617486338797814

2913418,4,B000U0C9UE,I purchased both of Gary Kraftsow videos and they were very similar so that wasn't expected.  I'm relatively new to yoga so was trying to find a video that was slow enough for me to follow yet provided enough benefit to continue - both of these would fall into that category.,1221350400,,275,4.392156862745098
2913419,5,B000U0C9UE,"My back started going out when I was in my early 40s. In the fall of 2006, when I was 51, it went out twice in a relatively short period, and the second time was very painful and debilitating. I started using practices from Gary's book, ""Yoga For Wellness,"" to begin the healing process and made a lot of progress over a period of about a month.

In 2007, I attended a four-day class Gary gave based on this DVD and it's companion on practices for the upper back, shoulders and neck. I bought both DVDs and my back hasn't gone out or been tweaked since I began doing the practices.

Gary makes the point that you have to be consistent in your practice. He says it's like flossing your teeth. I do a modified version of practice 3 on this DVD about four times a week.

My office mate's back went out at about the same time as mine did in 2006. He complained for months that it was still giving him problems. Earlier this year, I lent him the lower back DVD, since I have the practice memorized and I put the audio versions on my MP3 player. He has been doing the practices ever since and reports a big improvement.

I love Gary's therapeutic approach and highly  recommend these DVDs.",1221350400,10,1183,4.286995515695067
2913420,5,B000U0C9UE,"I've been using this DVD daily for the past 6 months and I can't imagine starting my day without it. I'm a fairly active person who also does more vigorous yoga, but I think this is gentle enough for those new to yoga or regular activity. There's lots of info on the reasons for back pain and detailed instruction for all the poses.  There are three actual practices, a very gentle 20 minute sequence for low back, a 30 minute gentle sequence targeting hips, and a 30 minute sequence designed to build more strength and stability for hips and low back.  I do the third one almost exclusively.  Love that audio versions of the sequences are provided so I can practice with my iPod when I'm away from home or want to go to another room without a dvd player.",1221004800,8,755,4.378571428571429
2913421,4,B000U0C9UE,"Although this is an excellent DVD and provides useful information, I took one star away as it fails to relate the low back, sacrum and hip postures to what is happening in the upper thoracic and cervical spine.

I am a licensed massage therapist. One of my first massage teachers reminded the class: ""Remember you neck is connected to your butt.""  Structurally, there are muscles that run the length of the back from neck to buttocks. While viewing the sequences in full before practicing them, I saw a high risk potential for anyone who has any problematic areas such as: TMJ, previous concussions, whiplash, flattened cervical spine, thoracic outlet syndrome or thoracic entrapment, carpal tunnel, problematic wrists or knees. For example: in Dvipada Pitham coming up too high onto the shoulders further flattens the cervical spine onto the floor, increases stress in the thoracic outlet which in turn affects the brachial nerve plexus and blood flow to the arms; in Bhujangasana and Salabhasana placing the forehead directly on the floor has the tendency to flatten the cervical spine and increase the compression in the thoracic angles and scalenes---turning the head to one side is structuraly less stressful to the neck; the Jathara Parivritti variations on this DVD I would recommend avoiding altogether if you have any cervical problems unless you have proper supervision.

The yoga students who are featured on this DVD have most likely studied with Gary for a long time; thus, being well prepared and suited for many of these techniques.

 I would recommend Viniyoga over all other styles of yoga.  If you have chronic neck and shoulder pain, I would recommend studying with a trained Viniyoga teacher or Viniyoga therapist before attempting this DVD.  He/She will be trained to help you identify your trouble spots and adapt the more challenging postures to what is possible for you.",1219536000,20,1894,5.090322580645161

2913423,2,B000U0C9UE,"As a middle aged woman just starting to do yoga, this DVD was too difficult. There are no modifications of the postures for someone who is just beginning and may not be as flexible as the people who are demonstrating. Once the work-out gets going, the positions are repeated too quickly and then it goes right into the next one at a fairly rushed pace. Having to stop/start the DVD was distracting. Yoga is supposed to be partially spiritual in nature and I just found this to be more frustrating than helpful. It was disappointing to spend almost $25 on this DVD to find this out (and to have to pay return shipping for a partial refund.) I would recommend a slower paced yoga DVD if you are new to yoga, are older and/or have painful hips or knees.",1215475200,76,750,4.402877697841727
2913424,5,B000U0C9UE,"My husband and I have been doing this practice for a while and we both love it. Gary Kraftsow's voice and instruction are very clear, understandable and unambiguous. There is no distracting music. The setting is pleasant with simplicity, not distracting or gimmicky. The people doing the movements follow Gary Kraftsow's cues along with the viewer at home. Their movements demonstrate what is being cued but they are not like choreographed ballet dancers or gymnasts; they are obviously experienced yoga practitioners but one can identify with them and thus be open to learning from their demonstrations. The pace is very good for allowing understanding of the movement and the breath. The practices are vigorous but when finished one is very relaxed and the areas of concentration (in this DVD it's the low back, sacrum and hips) feel relaxed and much improved, where there might have been problems before. This is becoming our favorite yoga practice and we recommend this viniyoga DVD most highly, as well as Gary Kraftsow's other viniyoga DVD for shoulders, upper back and neck - also excellent. It is a joy to have found these DVDs. We are very grateful to Mr. Kraftsow for developing these practices and to all who are responsble for making these available.",1214784000,24,1262,5.014285714285714
2913425,5,B000U0C9UE,"This is an effective program for eradicating back pain.  After one twenty minute session I was able to sleep through the night without being awakened by the back pain that has plagued me for months.

While this DVD does not have the fantastic music and interesting back drops as some of my favorite yoga DVDs it, along with Viniyoga Therapy for the Upper Back, Neck and Shoulders, has exactly what I need: a comprehensive back pain relieving program.  And, really, that matters more than anything else!

I was pleased to see easily accessible technique instructions for each pose.  I didn't find it necessary for most poses, but was very thankful to have it for the few poses I felt I wasn't doing 100% correctly.  At the end of the technique instructions I was taken back to where I'd left off in the program.  It would be fantastic if more yoga DVDs had this feature!

The DVD comes with an MP3 for each of the three practices on the DVD with the verbal instructions for each pose, making it simple to do the yoga practices when you're away from a DVD player.",1214265600,8,1061,4.518324607329843

2913427,3,B000U0C9UE,"The video is more suitable for people with less active life style. There are three exercise sessions in this video, each one is roughly 30 minutes long. It is recommended that you'd better get used to the first two exercises before doing the strongest one. They have positive effects and the instruction is clear. But in my experience, they are all too light.",1212537600,4,359,4.714285714285714
2913428,3,B000U0C9UE,"I thought from reading all of the positive reviews and really no negatives that this was exactly the product that I was looking for.
I was in a car accident over a year ago and have 2 herniated discs and a messed up pelvis/sacrum. I have done constant therapy for the whole year with three different people. It could always get me better to a certain point and then I would backslide all the way back to where I started. I was told by an orthopedic doctor that I needed to have a sacroiliac fusion. You are out of commision for three months. That is not very appealing. I ordered this video hoping that it would work and it basically just offers stretching excercises that my PT already had me doing so it really did not help me. I think for some people it probably works well I am just usually the exception to the rule. I am going to try Prolotherapy next hopefully that will give me some relief.",1210464000,8,898,4.288235294117647

2913432,4,B000U0C9UE,I wanted something to help strengthen my back since I had an injury and my back needs some rehab. The dvd is very informative and explains each exercise and how they help. It is very easy to follow and I love the fact that I learn about my back from the dvd.  I have only had a few weeks but I can tell it is going to help my back and hips.  It is well worth the money and anyone who wants to build strength in their back and get rid of pain should try this.,1207958400,11,458,3.7604166666666665
2913433,5,B000U0C9UE,"This DVD focuses on issues of the lower body, specifically the lower back, hips, and sacrum (the other DVD in this series focuses on the upper body).  It differs from other yoga media offerings in that it contains a strong educational component in addition to the practice element.  Also, the practices offered on the DVD are designed for rehabilitation and strengthening, and thus they are more similar in feel to a physical therapy session than to a yoga class.

The main menu of this DVD consists of four separate segments:  1) Understanding Back Pain, 2) Technique Workshop, 3) Therapeutic Practices, and 4) Special Features.  The Technique Workshop provides the opportunity to study individual postures in greater depth.  The Viniyoga Therapeutic Practices offer three complete practice segments tailored to meet different needs as described below.  (Note: the DVD also provides bonus MP3 audio versions of each practice.)

1. Lower Back Therapy (23 minutes).  Gary recommends that you begin here, as this is the most gentle practice.  The postures are performed entirely on the floor and provide very mild stretching of the lower back area.
2. Hip Therapy (31 minutes).  This practice, while still gentle and centered on floor postures, focuses more on the hips.  Unlike more traditional hip-opening sequences found in other yoga practices, the goal here is to stretch the hips from four perspectives (front, back, and each side).
3. Strength and Stability (32 minutes).  This practice is the only one on the DVD to contain standing postures, and thus the intensity level is slightly higher than the other two.  Gary notes that it is designed to build long-term health and fitness in the low back, sacrum, and hips.

The practices feature a single student working on a mat against a rather sparse white set, with Gary providing instruction via voiceover.  Most people are likely to find the practices rather dry--Gary's voice is a big monotone and repetitive, and there's little ""fun factor"" here.  However, these are therapeutic in nature, and as such, they are quite effective.  Although I personally didn't get much out of the first two practices--mainly because the low back and hips aren't a problem area for me--I was pleasantly surprised by the third, as it nicely stretched out not only my lower back but also my upper back, shoulders, and entire torso.  This DVD would be useful for virtually anyone who is at risk for lower back issues, from those who work at physical labor to those with more chronic conditions.  I definitely recommend Viniyoga Therapy for Lower Back, Hips, and Sacrum as an excellent tool for alleviating pain and promoting health in the entire lower back area.",1207872000,203,2697,5.0588235294117645
2913434,4,B000U0C9UE,"I found the video to be as advertised and very useful.  I thought the discussions explaining yoga concepts, benefits, etc. was very informative in addition to the actual yoga excercises.",1207440000,3,186,5.2
2913435,5,B000U0C9UE,"This is not a flashy pretty video, but a low budget production. Don't let that put you off. No waterfalls or new age music here. Host Gary Kraftsow sold me when he mentioned he conducted a study for the NIH linking back pain relief with this specialized yoga that was later mentioned in the Annals of Internal Medicine. That gives his method some credibility. I'm just starting these postures and they seem to work. I am getting some relief.
 This DVD is in several manageable parts. Part one covers causes of back pain and some physiology and is surprisingly interesting.  Next there is a detailed section of all the poses. If you practice yoga already you may not need this stuff.  The real meat of the DVD is the 3rd section with 2 separate short workouts and a third part that is longer with strengthening poses. He recommends starting with the 2 short practices  before moving to the strenghtening postures. Good advice because I tried the strengthening poses ahead of schedule and it was a little painful. I started over a few days later with the easier 'aligning' practice and I'm back in business. I am feeling better after just a few days. These poses are deceptively easy. They gently get the muscles back where they need to be. It makes sense. I would recommend this DVD to fellow back pain sufferers.",1207008000,219,1312,4.642241379310345
2913436,5,B000U0C9UE,"A few days of doing the practices on this DVD ended a month of chronic pain in my hips, low back, and hamstrings. I had better results from this DVD than from a month of costly physical therapy. The practice is very intelligently designed, with its focus on dynamic stretches rather than long, static holds. For me personally, the long static holds of other therapeutic DVDs seemed to aggravate my problems, while this DVD provided relief. The practice is deceptively simple; I was skeptical after doing it the first time. But the next day, my pain had significantly lessened.

I will say that the practice is clinical and dry. The set is a plain, white background. You see a lone exerciser (a normal person, for once!) on a mat moving through the exercises while Gary narrates offscreen. Gary has a nasal voice--not particularly soothing. And narrates every movement--inhale, arms up, exhale arms down--all the way through. When you get to savasanah, he says, ""This practice is now over. Stay in savasanah as long as you want."" I prefer a guided relaxation, and find that I almost never stay in the pose after the session ends, which probably reduces some of the benefit.

The practices are also available as mp3s, so that you can download them to your ipod and practice anywhere. That's probably why the instruction is so meticulous.

If you want a beautiful, visually appealing yoga practice, this is not it. If, however, you need relief from chronic pain in your lower back, sacrum, and hips--this video is fantastic.",1204329600,51,1521,4.842307692307692
