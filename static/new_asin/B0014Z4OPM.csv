Robodoc is devoid of laughs, snickers, or even a smirk. The jokes it tries were beaten to death long ago. If you watch this movie you will not get that part of your life you wasted back.

8256707,1,B0014Z4OPM,Wow Idk what movie some of these review watched. good lord that movie was lame. I would have thought the movie was good when I was 12 due to the ample frontal nudity. But the fart jokes  and all the guys getting twitterpated over a barely good looking chick is so old and worn out. It made the movie drag on and on.,1451779200,,315,4.0
