6425892,2,B00KGVV37M,"I have to agree with some other reviews, this seemed to jump around a lot.  It was really more drama than action.  The human clone element was fairly pointless other than the fact that the guy seemed unstoppable, and programed, almost more machine than human.  Its obviously set up for a sequel, which I wouldn't recommend.  I didn't connect with any of the characters, so when the emotional scenes came they had little effect.  Also, no terrorist, or mercenary worth a dime, would work with a mad man that likes to tell people where he is going to detonate a bomb--I've seen better bad guys on TV shows (not the actor, just the way the character was written).  Several characters that could have been used, weren't, they were written into the story, but didn't have an effect on the outcome--more or less just fillers for the camera.  Acting was okay, not great, they had some more experienced actors that were barely given any lines or scenes--wasted opportunities in my opinion.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1421366400,,1024,4.778409090909091
6425893,5,B00KGVV37M,Interesting. Loved Adam Cardon. Some slight confusion with plot but overall enjoyed it.,1419292800,,87,5.769230769230769
6425894,4,B00KGVV37M,"Much better than expected. Adam Cardon was excellent as well as very handsome..... Thought some of the supporting cast was a little weak but overall enjoyable. A lot of action. Very cool beginning!!

I would watch again",1418688000,,219,4.918918918918919
6425895,4,B00KGVV37M,"Not a bad show. Premise was interesting though a bit hard to follow and in found myself struggling to suspend disbelief. Production quality was pretty solid. As another reviewer noted, action was well done. Wouldn't be surprised to see this on cable at some point. Acting ranged from good to bad. Tamer Hassan and Adam Cardon were good. The females were a little on the weak side. Overall a good show",1418428800,3,400,4.647887323943662
6425896,4,B00KGVV37M,Much better than I thought it would be!  Good action!,1412985600,,53,4.3
6425897,2,B00KGVV37M,"The film opens with a pseudo-history lesson during the opening credits. It starts in 1302 with the founding of the Ordo Mundi and in 1765 the Sons of Liberty were founded with the Tea Party complete with line about refreshing from time to time. We jump to Australia...and I am not sure how that played in and then a human clone in 1974 who takes over the 1302 order, the 1980 October Surprise, and then some stolen yellow cake. Your job Mr. Hall is to combine all this together in one story and then direct it. Good Luck.

It seems the bad guys which appears to be part of this order wants to get U-235 and create some sort of bomb to explode...somewhere a ""micro-nuclear terrorist threat."". Our hero group is actually Homeland Security. They are following the trail of items being bought while investigating the murder of girls with markings (numbers?) carved into them.

Tom (Adam Cardon) is our good guy on a crutch, but don't fret, his newly recruited girlfriend who is scientist, small arms expert, and boxer can help out as a new special agent.

I loved the opening. Good early plot points, okay graphics, and decent soundtrack. However after that, the plot seemed to have drifted all over the place, possibly from having too many script writers...too many chefs. It appears they had either a professional adviser or did bother to Goggle stuff, as they had most of the key words and phrases, but Co-65 doesn't exist on the ""Chart of the Nuclides"" and would have a 1-2 second half-life if it did (i.e. they are not buying it and having it shipped.) U-235 does not have a ""gravitational signature"" but does emit an 80 kev photon.

This is listed as action sci-fi. It seems one guy is a clone. I am not sure what he does. That is the extent of the ""sci-fi"" element. There is some action, but it is more drama than action. My bore factor crept up.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. 2 Stars is generous.",1409356800,19,1899,4.508720930232558

I'll leave the script reviews to others because after watching about 25% of this I had no idea what was going on.  My biggest gripe is the sound - i.e. very poor quality sound recording.  I could hear the gunshots and the screaming restrained girl, but any conversation was too faint to hear a mere 8' away from my speakers, with system volume turned up to 94.  If the actors can't project their voices enough to be picked up by the microphones then they are poor actors.  If the director can't instruct the actors to project their voices then that person is a poor director.  And if the sound people can't get the sound, then they are poor at their jobs. Most of a story line is revealed in the dialogue, so not being able to hear the dialogue makes this a poor story.

6426162,1,B00KGVV37M,"The first 5 minutes is pretty cool, but after that it becomes a bunch of what seem to be unrelated scenes. Either this movie has no plot, or it has so many sub-plots that there is no one core story. There's some young woman that is basically a jack-of-all-trades female James Bond. She and the main character, Tom Jones (that name is not unusual) are Government secret agents. Just to make the plot(?) more confusing, there are 3 or 4 women that look almost identical at first, and for a while I wasn't sure if it was the same woman acting as a double-agent with a (very obvious) fake Irish accent. The guy from Assassin's Creed keeps popping up, too. It's not REALLY him, but he's a bad guy and he's supposed to do something, or stop something, or stop someone from stopping something, I don't know. After an hour all I understood was that someone was trying to smuggle in yellow cake uranium, and there was a serial killer on the loose. Those two may or may not be related - by the time I gave up watching there was still no connection between them.

This started out looking like a really cool movie, but it quickly turned into a failed pilot for a CSI rip-off, complete with a quirky group of science nerds, most of whom could moonlight as models in a JCPenny's catalog.

While it had a few moments of being a decent film and the acting is (mostly) passable for a B movie, you can really tell it's low budget o the holding of firearms and detaining people: a higher-budget film would have had a competent police/military advisor. The cat fight near the end started because the agent didn't know how to secure and detain someone and got too close while allowing her to face her for example. the plot is a jumbled mess that was probably written for 3 times the length and then cut without regard to continuity leaving it largely inscrutable.",1432166400,,598,4.445454545454545

I am truly tired of these post modern movies that do not resonate with real life and at best can be described as produced by the angst of someone's sexual confusion and/or anger.  Yes, I get the message; girls are stronger, smarter leaders while boys are impulsive, errant fools who get shot.  That isn't how military operators conduct themselves.  The manner in which the actors portray the war on terror is an insult to the men and women who actually do get down into the dirt and risk their lives to keep nuclear weapons from detonating in U.S. cities.  We see an increasing number of attempts to typecast society as this film does and the reason such films wind up as a streamed freebies and not big screen hits is because they are dripping with false narratives and Americans still aren't buying them no matter for how many decades they are slung at the audience.  If you want to make a movie successful, leave what you learned from your preachy liberal arts professors in the closet with your graduation gown, their false narrative will never be real life.  Settle for equality, you've got it; but society isn't going to be forced into a ""weak man strong woman"" paradigm so diligently sought by the bullies producing movies like this.",1488240000,5,1412,4.624
