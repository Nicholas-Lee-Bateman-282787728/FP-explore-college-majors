2583427,3,B000FS9FOY,"This DVD consists of a compilation of film from Germany during 1918-1933. It's an OK DVD, but a more descriptive title for it would be ""Life in Germany 1918-1933."" Only part of the film deals with Hitler and the Nazis. Much of it is just the daily activities of Germans during that period. There is no narration. There are English subtitles for any German that is spoken. The audio does not always match the video, not particularly a surprise since much of the film was shot prior to sound in movies.

I spotted only one error: the film says that Hitler was the editor of the party newspaper, ""Vlkischer Beobachter."" Not true. Hitler owned the paper, but its most famous editor was Alfred Rosenberg.

So buy this DVD to get an idea of life in Germany in the 1920s, but don't expect a narrative about the Nazi rise to power.",1312675200,13,823,4.48

2583452,4,B000FS9FOY,No narrarator just collection of period newsreels and movie clips showing life in Germany from 1918 to 1933. Help understand why Germans made the decisions that ruined them.,1438905600,,173,5.214285714285714
2583453,4,B000FS9FOY,"This video consists almost entirely of original, well translated material from German Cinema, Newsreels, and purpose made propaganda, to provide a narrrative of the events in Germany from WW1 to Shortly after Hitler's Taking power in the early to mid 30s. Unlike most Documentaries, this collection offers no independent Commentary or outside narrative, but relies on the media of the day, along with skillfully added music and other sound effects, to tell its story. In short, it lets the material speak for itself.

Of Course, one did not require Narrative to present a biased viewpoint of the time and events through selective editing. However, I find the film does an excellent job of presenting the issies and events of the day in a forthright and fairly balanced manner.

In some ways the films strengths are also its weaknesses. For someone well versed in history of the period, the film is refreshingly different and easy to follow. However,  those with little or no previous background in the subject matter (the Rise of the Nazis in Pre War Germany) will probably find the film somewhat bewildering and hard to keep up with at times..
This is the type of film that I, a Historian, enjoyed, but would not show to one of my classes without giving them some prior background material on the subject.",1437955200,4,1306,4.873873873873874
2583454,5,B000FS9FOY,"Embryonic Nazism, fascism. Adoring eyes gaze on the young idol with evil DNA who soon turns into a  tyrannical Pied Piper, SS, Brown Shirts, goose stepping, book burning, and much worse. Thank God it's history  and we have these examples to warn us so it won't happen again.. Heh, heh",1433721600,,284,4.66
2583455,3,B000FS9FOY,"The movie starts out kind of slow but after the first 20 minutes it seems to hold it's own. There is no spoken English here, all sub-titles; this lends to the slowness of the production. I wasn't aware of this when I first chose to watch it. There was some information in here that I was not aware of/had not seen or read elsewhere.",1432080000,,332,4.203125
2583456,2,B000FS9FOY,The film lacked any sense of direction whatsoever. The contemporanious footage was intriguing but was unaccompanied by any narration that could have provided context. Altogether a poor effort.,1431993600,,192,5.892857142857143

2583468,4,B000FS9FOY,"Yes, this is all subtitled with no narration in any language. So yes, you have to pay attention, but there are not even that many subtitles. We watched this in our homeschool as we are studying WWII. Our family thought it was an excellent view of what went on  between the wars and showing how Hitler came to power.",1429747200,,315,4.338983050847458

2583470,5,B000FS9FOY,I am a WW2 history lover. I have researched and studied for years to understand how the  type of horror that came out of this leadership happened. i must say that I never knew that the book burning had a major focus on Einstein and that was why he left Germany. I love learning new things although I have to say learning this saddened me I was very happy that the US welcomed him with open arms and honored his intelligence. This is a remarkable documentary.,1428192000,,458,4.325581395348837
2583471,3,B000FS9FOY,"As other viewers have said, one must already have an understanding of the period to understand this documentary and not end up confused, offended, and/or bored.  It is a 1970's compilation of original film footage from the time, most of it direct from the Nazi propaganda machine, subtitles only, and no guiding narration.  It is footage I have seen many times in other documentaries recounting what happened to Germany that created the catastrophe we call WWII.  It gives it to the viewer more or less ""raw"" but in chronological order, leaving the viewer to draw their own conclusions, something I think many, especially young people, are ill equipped to do.  My father was a Silver Star veteran who was part of the supply line following Gen. Patton's troops and I ended up being stationed in Bavaria in the mid '70's not too far from his position when the war ended.  I have been studying the ""why?"" of this for a long time and still found the intent of this film a bit unclear.",1427500800,2,980,4.641618497109826

2583477,4,B000FS9FOY,A great documentary .It helped me to  understand the situation surrounding the rise of Adolf Hitler and how he came to power .,1408233600,,126,4.478260869565218
2583488,4,B000FS9FOY,"This film offers an editor's view into the perceptions created in period media.  The subtitles were very close summaries, if lacking in some cultural nuance.  Among the last several minutes the editor implies a musical love story is somehow allegory to Hindenburg and Hitler's (or Germany and Hitler's?) relationship; that theme alone is truly vapid.  At times earthy, this film is a portal to imagining how a citizen living in Germany might have been pleased to have see Hitler bring order to a chaotic depression.  This is history, with a slant.  We should listen for echoes of these speeches today and loudly respond: ""Nie wieder!"".",1404604800,2,635,5.0095238095238095
2583489,4,B000FS9FOY,"Unlike most treatments on the rise of the Nazis in Germany, instead of telling the story as a historical monologue; this uses snippets of newsreels from the tine period of about 1920's in Germany through the mid-1930's when Hitler and the Nazis had taken power in Germany. These newsreels illustrate the sentiments and circumstances of the German people at the time. They also illustrate the message that Hitler and the Nazi's were giving to the German people. If you know history already, these newsreels are invaluable in making history more alive and personal. At first I started to wonder if this film had been put together by a Nazi sympathizer in the period. But later in the film I began to see the lies and manipulation of the Nazi's and Hitler. The most poignant was shortly after he had assumed dictatorial power, Hitler promised to give up power in 4 years. But four years later he was well entrenched in control and began WW2.",1404000000,,938,4.725609756097561

2583493,3,B000FS9FOY,"This is a mash-up of early films chronicling the rise of Nazi party in Germany.  With good audio and sub-titles, it was thought-provoking.  The film caused me to Google some events, and to see the 1930s in Germany from a more nuanced perspective.

Unfortunately, there was no coherent story or narrative...just a collection of seldom-seen films in chronological sequence.",1397865600,,371,5.254237288135593
2583494,4,B000FS9FOY,"As others have said, this 1973 ""documentary"" is a bunch of archival footage strung together with occasional period music but no commentary whatsoever, just subtitles for translation purposes, or to give time and place (""Nazi Party Rally, Nuremberg, 1927""). It's somewhat like ""The Atomic Cafe"" in that regard. If you already know the history of 1919-1923 Germany and the Nazi party, you'll see some great archival footage of ordinary people and early party campaign events you won't find in more mainstream documentaries. Good stuff. If you are not already familiar with the rise of the Nazis, you will probably find the documentary utterly baffling  because it explains absolutely nothing, or who any of the people are -- for example, when Goebbels speaks at the opening of the 1933 Berlin speech, he is identified, but if you didn't already know who Goebbels was, you wouldn't know his significance.

I would have given this 5 stars, but I found the ending jarring. The last scenes are of the infamous book burning, and then the documentary just ends with a pithy statement. I got the distinct impression the makers really didn't know how to wrap things up, and it was disappointing when the narrative basically just stopped without warning.",1397001600,,1243,5.029126213592233
2583495,4,B000FS9FOY,"This film will make the most sense to those who already know the story of Nazi Germany. There are no narrators to guide you. Essentially, this is a (mostly) chronological compilation of newsreels, slice of life, propaganda pieces, motion picture productions, man on the street, etc., vignettes ... the faces and the places of Germany in the 1920's and 1930's. The turmoil of the times is evident. The increasingly violent demands for conformity to the collective are evident.",1394496000,2,475,5.102564102564102
2583496,1,B000FS9FOY,"I applaud their attempt to show real life film clips to show his rise but it would have done better if they had people talking between flicks.  While the film's intent is to show how Hitler came to power, the film could be used to glorify him.",1394064000,2,243,4.170212765957447
2583497,2,B000FS9FOY,"Basically this was a bunch of vintage films strung together with no commentary. Many of the movies used did NOT take place when stated in this product. Also, without commentary one doesn't get the full impact of the events which led to Hitler's rise to power: the Versailles Treaty, the ineffectiveness of the Weimar Republic, the endless calls for new elections, the Red attempts to seize power, hyperinflation, immorality, instability... all this helped to set the stage for the Nazi rise to power. This film only serve students of the period who already have an understanding of history.",1393113600,,590,5.030612244897959
2583498,2,B000FS9FOY,"Just seemed to piece together available footage that is always interesting. But no general theme - flow of history, etc.",1392336000,,120,5.05
2583499,2,B000FS9FOY,"For those of us who are always looking for original footage clips during the pre WWII era, this offers just that. No narration and few subtitles. The title? Certainly not descriptive but perhaps that was the intent! Interesting presentation of a compilation of original footage clips intended to present a nonviolent (for the most part) image of the German people. Day to day life that includes the multifaceted interests and concerns of post WWI Germany and the socioeconomic reasons that led to the ideology of the Nazi party. Of interest is the profile of Hitler as an orator . . . mannerisms and rhetoric. Recommend for those who have an interest in this timeline and the psychological ramifications. Students of military history may find this an interesting format for the original footage clips.

[Offered with Amazon prime instant video . . . I would not choose to purchase ether the DVD or instant video. Perhaps this is best described as an 'artistic endeavor.' ]",1391558400,,972,4.926829268292683

2583501,5,B000FS9FOY,"I KNEW why but never UNDERSTOOD why, until I watched this film. This is the best documentary I have ever seen on the subject.
I don't think young people will understand it because, as other reviewers point out, it is not pundits, punditing. You have to already know the story.
The thing that really got me though was during the speeches, the number of times I thought, ""Wow, I read that on a comment board this week!""
Good night and good luck, (RIP ERM),

2583502,4,B000FS9FOY,The documentary footage was fascinating.  The film footage gives great insight into life in Germany in the 1920's and early 1930's.  I found the footage of life in Berlin particularly interesting.  I would have given the film 5 stars but did not because it did not cover more about the process of Hitler's and the Nazis' rise to power.,1386201600,,335,4.6440677966101696
2583503,5,B000FS9FOY,Excellent video with film that I have never seen before and I have seen just about every video on the rise of the Nazis.  What impressed me the most was what was missing .... the standard obligatory PC verbiage insulting of everything associated with the Nazis.  Don't get me wrong but I am just tired of standard commentaries ... I don't need to be told about the evil.  But there were reasons that Hitler came to power with the support of so many Germans.,1386028800,6,457,4.416666666666667
2583504,4,B000FS9FOY,"I've been searching for documentaries on Germany from the 1st World War through the beginning of World War II. (No time to read printed matter on the subject - at some point I'll have the time to pore over books, hopefully). This helped fill in some of the blanks, so that the late '30s/early '40s' astounding explosion of Jewish hatred (along with hatred of intellectuals and pretty much anyone/thing different), along with many Germans' seemingly blind acceptance of the Nazi party's actions leading up to and including the Final Solution - well, this shows how that came out of a relatively linear momentum and evolution.

I have to remember that in the 1930s there was no internet or television - I imagine that many of the poorer people didn't even have a radio.  So if the general populace seems, well, stupid (sorry to offend, but it's my impression); it makes sense when you realize that whatever it was fed by newspapers (which were increasingly controlled by Nazis and their sympathizers), posters, and speeches seemed as much like God-given truth as anything.

I can also see how anyone with more education, and/or or a fertile brain became alarmed (and many of those were systematically pushed out, or given an extra alarm by events such as the book burning shown at the end of this film). Every time this & other doc.'s show a Nazi speech, it just sounds like high-pitched, barking dogs to me - wah, wah, wah, wah.  Sure, scary enough to make one leave the country if possible. But I can also see how some were slow to take it seriously. Who woulda thunk a bunch of angry crackpots could take over a country?

Many thanks to the filmmakers who labored to put this together. It also helped me to watch a documentary on Hitler Youth, as well as several films that show things from various sides, such as The Tin Drum.

The lessons to take away seem, once again:  Beware of simple, black-and-white answers/solutions.  Beware of any group that becomes desperate to find a scapegoat for its problems.",1378252800,8,2008,4.717142857142857
2583505,5,B000FS9FOY,I always enjoy seeing the old Germany before we bombed it into rubble. It is a unique look at the gradual process of how Hitler slowly gained his power. One has to understand the economical and political stress of the time to grasp how this process was accomplished by Hitler's group. This group of people he assembled to be his leaders were deeply troubled and were destined for failure with their wild beliefs in groundless myths and the total disregard for the value of a human life.,1377561600,3,486,4.597701149425287
2583506,5,B000FS9FOY,"If you want to be spoon fed anti-German, political correctness propaganda, this is not the film for you.  Instead, director Lutz Becker lets the viewer decide, showing archive film of the times.  National Socialist Germany does not look all that bad compared to the current state of things in the U.S, even the book burning scene is small potatoes....so what if they burned a pile of books that were detrimental to their culture and nation.",1371427200,5,440,4.8533333333333335
2583507,5,B000FS9FOY,"So much of our history has been ""lost"" for whatever reason.  I'm glad this footage was not ""lost"".  This was produced in 1973, when people could put together a documentary on this subject without worrying about if someone might get offended, or maybe they didn't care if someone did get offended--they made the video, anyway.  I did have a chuckle, tho, in reference to the stars of this movie.  The description said it starred Adolph Hitler and Buster Keaton.  There was plenty of Adolph, but only a few seconds of Buster, standing on the street, almost looking confused as to why he was in the movie, maybe?  That being said, for someone to amass almost 1.5 hours of footage from about 80 years ago, given the technology of the day, this video was/is amazing.  There was footage I've never seen or heard before, and I've watched a lot of shows on the History Channel in the past about Nazis and the Holocaust.  Well worth watching, even if you only watch it once.  It's amazing how many correlations there are between what went on almost 80 years ago and what's going on right now in the world around us.  What we learn from history is we don't learn from history, generally.  Maybe we can change that in a positive way?",1362009600,16,1222,4.534246575342466
