7913198,2,B00000JQV1,"I just received my DVD a few hours ago of ""The Cockpit"" double billed with an anime feature ""Digital Devil"".  I saw a clip of ""The Cockpit"" on Youtube, and it looked very intriguing, but the watching it now as I write this review, the DVD authorship is one of the worse I've ever seen for an anime title.  Distributed by some company called Kiseki, I can only assume that they used bargain basement  authorship equipment.  Movic, an extremely well known anime company, is known for quality titles, and I'm surprised that they let their property get put on such a poorly authored disk.

I have lots of anime in my DVD collection, and even the b-movie titles, titles I don't like and don't watch, have better compression and authorship than this thing.

Seriously, it looks like all these people did was to transfer the VHS finished master to optical media, and then mass produce the disks, which is what the major studios did when DVDs first hit the marketplace.  It's that bad.

Avoid this thing.

I'm sorry I bought it.",1371427200,,1020,4.5911602209944755
7913199,4,B00000JQV1,"I tried playing this disc on a normal NTSC player and it would not work. It then dawned on me this is an all-region PAL disc, so, unless you have a video player than can do PAL discs, you won't be able to see this video. I suppose you can also see it using a computer player.

Technical things aside, I bought this one solely based on the first feature directed by Kawajiri Yoshiaki (""Jubei Ninpucho""/""Ninja Scroll,"" ""Wicked City,"" ""The Running Man,"" ""Cyber City Oedo 808,"" etc). The story might be a bit hard to take since it seems to be taking an accusatory tone against the allied use of the atomic bombs during the last part of WWII, but if you can manage to ignore that and focus on the quality of the animation and designs you will note this is some of the best animated OAV stuff out there bar none. It's true about the old cliche saying, ""They don't make them like they used to.""

The other features and the ""Digital Devil"" OAV I consider as filler material. They're good, but I suggest you check out ""The Stratospheric Air Current"" on YouTube to see the best segment of this video compilation.",1350691200,,1102,4.397058823529412
7913200,4,B00000JQV1,"Here are three World War II stories set twords the end of the war, and told from the Axis perspective (though the second story actually shows things from both the American and Japanese perspective).

The first tale is about the Eurpean war. It is set in August of 1944, and the protagonist Luffwaffe pilot Erhart Von Leinders. He is given a mission that, if successful, could turn the war back in Germany's favor. He is to fly a special prototype fighter and act as escort for a captured B-17, now bearing the German cross and swastika, to Berlin. It is carrying top-secret cargo, and also on board are Leinders' old friend, the scientist Professor Baffstein and Baffstein's daughter and Leinders' old flame Marlena. Just before take off, Marlena reveals to Leinders what they'll be transporting: the world's first A-bomb, which after being delivered will be launched by V-1 rocket to one of the three capitals of the Allied countries. Leinders is shocked and horrified that they'll be using such a destructive weapon, and while on route to Berlin when they encounter three British Spitfires he must make a decision: does he fullfill his mission and shoot the Spitfires down before they can destroy the bomber, or does he allow the enemy craft to shoot the bomber down, even though it will mean the deaths of Marlena and Baffstein and doom Germany to defeat?

(SPOILER WARNING)

Someone criticized this first story for being historically inaccurate, as it has Germany developing the A-bomb before America. However, given that the story ends with the bomber being destroyed in mid-air, this would mean the world would have never found out Germany had ever developed the bomb, so it's easy for me to accept.

The second story is set on the day before and the day during the Hiroshima bombing. An American fleet sits at the shore of Japan and is attacked by the remains of Japan's airforce. A Japanese kamikaze pilot waits to be launched out of a bomber in a rocket plane into the American aircraft carrier. However, the bomber is shot down and the pilot, who was supposed to be the one to die, ironically ends up being the only one to survive. He swims back to shore and returns to base, only to be sent back up in another bomber piloted by another crew to attempt the same mission. We also get to see scenes in the U.S. aircraft carrier where the Americans prepair for the oncoming Japanese.

The final story is about ground troops rather than airmen. Two Japanese infantry men-one middle-aged man and one young boy-are defending one of their home islands that the Americans are taking over. They get into a two-seat motorcycle of the sort that has a cockpit seat attached to the side and ride to home base, even knowing that, most likely, the Americans have probably already taken it over and their mission will probably lead to their deaths.

My one criticisims with this video are the way certain characters act in the first two stories. In the first tale there is a German fighter pilot who is just so surprised and outraged that Hitler would actually use an A-bomb when it's probably the only thing that could turn the tide back in their favor. O.K., let's look at a few things: these are the same rulers who offically declared Jewish people inferior and impure and called for their complete extinction. Every German living in Germany knew full-well about their persecution, of the death camps and the mass execution of helpless, unarmed people, many of them children, guilty of absolutely nothing except being Jewish. Every man who served in the German army at the time knew full well about all that, even those that did not participate directly in it, and they willfully fought and risked life and limb for the Nazi butchers. And the army was participating directly in invading neighboring countries and taking them over by force. So here we have this guy who'd have to at the very least think little enough of the mass-murder of Jews to be willing to turn his back to the holocaust and serve the country that was commiting those atrocities, and he helps fight to take over surrounding countries, yet this same guy when finding out Germany is going to use a newly-developed super-powerful bomb against an enemy capital because it's probably the only chance they have left of winning, suddenly decides that's just going too far, and is torn with indesision when he must decide wether or not to help carry out a mission that, while may mean the deaths of countless innocent lives, is still no worse than the evils he had been willing to ignore or even take part in before.

Then there's the American aircraft carrier captian who, at the end of the story when he's told an A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, says,""Monsters. Makes you wonder, are we all insane?"" I suppose this was done to make an American character that Japanese audiences would find sympathetic, but again, looking at history, I find this hard to believe. While I suppose it's possible there may have been some Americans who, even during the war, didn't hate all Japanese (even though that was sadly common in a time when open racisim was much more accepted,) we still must look at a few things: Japan had told America back in 1941 they wanted to be our allies, then made a sneak attack at Pearl Harbor, having made no declaration of war. This brought us into a terrible conflict that last nearly four years, a war that was nessissary, but took countless American lives (as well as Japanese) and like any other war left many still alive but with missing limbs and/or psychologically scared. It was a war in which we were fighting for our very freedom, against the threat of a powerful and aggressive enemy. America at the time felt about Japan much the same way we do now about Al-Quida and the Taliban. Our men were fighting heroically to defend our homeland. Twords the end of the war when we fought Japanese on their own home islands they inflicted terrible casulties, well more than half of the American troops who fought against the Japanese ground forces were killed. Then when we were surrounding Japan's home country, their goverment refused to surrender. This is what led to the firebombings and later the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I do believe this was a horrible thing that civilians were massacred, however I also think it was a sad, tragic nessassary. I blame Japan's own goverment at the time, for starting the war and for refusing to surrender even when they'd clearly lost any chance of victory, more than America. It was done so we wouldn't have to do a direct land invasion, which would have led to many more American casualties. You could argue that it would have been insane NOT to use the bomb.

Anyway, this is an excellent anthology and I think it's a shame it still hasn't been released in DVD, I just found some character motivations hard to swollow.",1184025600,,6852,4.713689482470785
7913201,4,B00000JQV1,"""The Cockpit"" is a collection of three animated vignettes depicting World War II stories from the perspectives of a Luftwaffe pilot, an Ohka (suicide bomb) pilot, and a Japanese motorcycle messenger.
The animation is spectacular, particularly in the aviation sequences. The last two episodes mix anatomically correct anime figures with cartoon grade caricatures, which takes a bit of getting used to, but becomes very effective once the viewer figures out what the two styles are being used to represent (the accurately drawn characters depict veteran pilots/aircrew, while the more cartoonish figures depict inexperienced, militarily naive characters).
The aircraft and other hardware are brilliantly accurate. The choice of a FockeWulf 190 as the German fighter rather than the better known Messerschmidt 109B/F reveals the degree of knowledge the creators brought to the board.
The single minor drawback is that the stories take extreme liberties with historical accuracy. First, the Germans did not develop a workable atomic weapon during the war. Second, no Japanese suicide weapon ever sank an Allied aircraft carrier or battleship.
That said, the power of these stories is in their emotional impact and the human perspective they bring to the inhumane practices of warfare. The bottom line is that the stories work and work well.
This collection is highly recommended for anyone who likes good movies and good storytelling, animated or otherwise.",963792000,2,1453,5.491071428571429
7913202,3,B00000JQV1,"The first episode of the series, dealing with a Luftwaffe pilot, is quite good but seems overdramatized.  The action sequences are quite well done, but the story leaves a bit to be desired.  The second, dealing with a kamikaze pilot, is the worst of the bunch.  The directors made bizarre  choices in their character design: some characters are well-drawn, while  others are oddly warped cartoons.  The dogfights are again well-done, but  again we wish we knew more about the characters.  The dialogue also shoves  the piece's moral messages down your throat instead of just telling a story  and leaving the viewer to figure out the lesson on their own.  The  third episode starts out weakly but becomes very good at the end.  The  trend of having some characters drawn bizarrely and others drawn seriously  continues, and is a bit annoying until you get used to it.  It is also  somewhat odd that planes only make brief appearances in this episode.  The  real dogfight comes in the way of a motorcycle duel which is (again) well  done.  As I said before, this film waxes and wanes.  At some points it's  very good, and at others it is bad.  These half-hour vignettes would have  been much better had they been done as hour-long episodes where we got to  know the characters, preferably with prologues to explain their  relationships.  The three interviews with the directors are a nice touch  but don't add anything or give any real insight.  The bottom line is that  it's worth seeing, but you're better off borrowing it from a friend or  rental store than buying it yourself.",956361600,,1578,4.75092936802974
7913203,3,B00000JQV1,"Even though Yoshiaki Kawajiri--one of my favorite anime directors--was directing one of the three segments of this video, I couldn't help but feel a bit unsatisfied when all was said and done.  This is not to say that  ""The Cockpit"" doesn't have its merits...it certainly does,  particularly the art direction in the first two episodes.  Kawajiri's  story, the first, is a down-to-the-rivet recreation of the air war over  Europe--the technical scope of this piece is nearly astonishing at times.  Having the protagonist of this piece be a Nazi Luftwaffe officer is a  daunting task, but for the most part Kawajiri and his crew manage to pull  it off, if a bit melodramatically.  Unfortunately in the interview  following this segment, Kawajiri continually sidesteps the moral aspects of  his story, choosing instead to focus on the technical aspects of it.
The  second segment also falls a bit short, and it is particularly disappointing  in this case, since the hero of this story is the Japanese flier who must  pilot an Ohka suicide rocket-bomb into a U.S. warship.  I was really  looking forward to a Japanese insight into the mind of a kamikaze pilot,  but unfortunately director Imanishi leaves too much unsaid--there is little  shown of the devotion of those pilots, not enough insights into what drove  these men to do what they did.  Nonetheless, what IS on the screen is  remarkable stuff.  ""The Cockpit"" is not superb, but it is very  good at times, story-wise.  And as usual, the technical achievements of the  animation, particularly in the dog-fight sequences, are often stunning.",955584000,,1595,5.038461538461538
