5839730,4,B00DOZNGC2,"MGM, the studio known more for its musicals from the late-1930s to the early-1960s, did produce some decent horror/thrillers.  Included in this collection, are four good films of the aforementioned genre.

The first, The Face of Marble (1946)tells the tale of a brilliant and reclusive doctor, Dr. Charles Randolph (John Carradine)and his associate, Dr. David Cochran (Robert Shayne of Christmas in Connecticut fame) are experimenting with re-animating the dead.  They begin with animals and look to use a human.  The other story line is a lukewarm plot involving the old housekeeper, Maria (Rosa Rey) who uses her voodoo skills to cast a spell that causes Mrs. Elaine Randolph (Claudia Drake) to fall for Dr. Cochran.  This ill-conceived plan causes many problems. This tragic one-sided attraction, Dr. Randolph's tragic decision to use a family pet and the appearance of Dr. Drake's fiancee, Linda Sinclair (Maris Wrixson) ramp up this meandering and interesting tale to a higher level.  The last half of the movie is the best.  The direction is decent and the use of B & W adds to the creepiness of the film.  A couple of notes, this film features one of the first uses of a animal ghost and Willie Best (best known for his appearances in many early comedies) adds some dark humor as the wide-eyed butler, Shadrach.

The second film, I Bury the Living (1958)plays more like an episodic TV drama.  Having said that, I enjoyed this tension-building chiller.  The film opens up with Robert Kraft (Richard Boone) being named the new director of the local cemetery.  He is introduced to the cemetery's caretaker, Andy McKee (Theodore Bikel) who shows him the ropes, including keeping track of the plots on a large wall map of the cemetery.  The systematic use of white push pins for vacant plots and black for used plots is central to this tale.  All seems fine until Kraft makes an error by using black push pins instead of white.  A series of accidental deaths ensues and Kraft begins to think he has the power of life and death.  This belief causes him to go on a downward spiral of guilt, fear and madness.  Seeing that Kraft is slipping into paranoia and self-destruction, a group of friends and relatives, including Kraft's fiancee, Ann Craig (Peggy Maurer), his uncle George Kraft (Howard Smith), a reporter friend, Jess Jessup (Herbert Anderson), and Lt. Clayborne (Robert Osterloh) try to convince through various methods that he is not causing people to die.  The movie holds its own until the ending (which was the alternative ending).  Still, the film holds up.  I do believe that the film could be remade with the original ending and be well-received.

The third film is The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake (1959).  This is the best of the four films included on this collection.  This dark tale opens with Jonathan Drake (Eduard Franz) and his daughter, Alison (Valerie French) sensing that Jonathan's brother is in danger.  Soon after, Kenneth Drake (Paul Cavanagh) dies mysteriously after receiving a shrunken head.  Jonathan and Alison arrive to attend the funeral and discover that someone has removed the death brother's head.  Lt. Jeff Rowan (Grant Richards)is assigned to investigate.  he meets the family, the servants and the mysterious Dr. Emil Zurich, (Henry Daniell) a friend of Kenneth Drake. Jonathan reveals his suspicion that the ancient family curse has claimed another Drake male.  he relays the story to his daughter who relays it to Lt. Rowan.  It seems someone or something is carrying out the ancient curse placed upon Jonathan's grandfather by a tribe of South American Indians.  This is a wonderful dark and gothic B & W chiller/horror film with some very good chills and surprises.  The cast is excellent and is led by the talented Mr. Franz as the intrepid professor of archeology and Mr. Daniell is menacing as the gloved Dr. Zurich.

The fourth and final film in this collection is The Snake Woman (1961).  This film manages to maintain its energy in spite of a couple of slow scenes.  The film begins with a Hammer Studios feel largely thanks to director Sidney J. Furie.  This stylish black & white film is well-scripted and acted.  The movie begins with Dr. Horace Adderson(John Cazabon)the late 19th century heptologist living in a tiny Umberland town in northern England inhabited by superstitious townspeople. It seems that Dr. Adderson (clever name for a snake specialist)has been injecting cobra venom into his wife to help her battle mental illness. Sadly, the wife dies while giving birth to a strange daughter with no eyelids and low body temperature. A local witch, Aggie Harker(Elsie Wagstaff) who claims that the newborn child is pure evil incites the townspeople to violence.  The film jumps forward 19 years later when a series of corpses are found dead from snake bites.  The culprit is Atheris Adderson (Susan Travers), the grown up 'snake child.' Col Clyde Wynborn (Geoffrey Denton) who believes there are supernatural forces at work asks for Scotland yard to investigate.  The frightened villagers believe that the curse of the snake woman has returned and seek to destroy the 'snake woman'.  Officer Charles Prentice (John Mccarthy) arrives and begins to investigate.  Of course, he falls for Artheris but stays on the case.  Logic meets superstition when the inspector meets with the witch and she foretells the destruction of the snake woman at the hand of the inspector.  The film is short and ends abruptly but is entertaining.",1382313600,7,5490,4.973684210526316
5839731,4,B00DOZNGC2,"In The Face of Marble it was good to see a young John Carradine, who was perfect for the part. The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake was creepy, but interesting.  I really enjoyed Richard Boone in I Bury the Living - that was the best one.  I liked the surprise ending. Did not like Snake Woman
at all, but three good movies out of four isn't bad.  Especially for the price I paid.",1381968000,,377,4.136986301369863
5839732,4,B00DOZNGC2,"I pre-ordered this because I was so excited about ""Face of Marble"", but was let down with the print quality.  The picture is shakey, too dark in a lot of scenes, and has one bad splice(where there may be a missing word or two).  It's watchable and the quality is annoying, but seems to be the best there is.  The Snake Woman is an interesting little British film with good quality and the only one in widescreen on this disc.  The other 2 films have been previously released and are again presented on this disc in full screen.  They are both missing the trailers that were on their previous discs.  Personally, I do not like to see new and previously released material mixed, especially with 4 films to a disc.",1381017600,3,711,4.430769230769231
5839733,1,B00DOZNGC2,"The image quality of FACE OF MARBLE is terrible! It's too dark and it flutters. Honestly, this looks like the kind of crap you'd get on one of those 100 movies for 50 cents collections. The other three titles are good quality but why not replace JONATHAN DRAKE and I BURY THE LIVING with something that hasn't been on disc yet like THE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN and DOCTOR BLOOD'S COFFIN? They were both released on laser disc so they've been re-mastered. Come on MGM or whoever it is that's releasing this old junk. You can do better than this.",1380672000,34,544,4.45
5839734,4,B00DOZNGC2,"MGM owns sooo many old Horror (ahem) Classics that they do nothing with but hoard. Putting 4 titles like this together is a great idea as I'm sure the wackos like me who keep their eye out for movies like ""Face Of Marble"" (a cool little flick, btw) are few and far between. However it would be even greater if two of the titles weren't previously released on DVD via their Midnite Movies series. I'm pretty sure these are just meant to be one of those cheap DVD items you pick up while checking out at Walmart so I'm sure not much care or TLC is going into them. But hopefully more goodies will finally find a home on DVD through this series.",1376870400,47,642,4.227642276422764
5839735,4,B00DOZNGC2,"Finally, The great ""B"" movie classic staring John Carradine, ""The Face Of Marble"" is coming to DVD.
Monogram Picture Corporation deserves more recognition for producing films with really cool atmosphere and I haven't seen The Face Of Marble for years.
Now it's time for the DVD relaeas of Columbia's ""Murder In Times Square"" starring Edmond Lowe and all of the original ""East Side Kids"" starring Leo Gorcey & Huntz Hall.
The Bowery Boys are becoming available on DVD but if you watch Turner Classic Movies you would had recently seen them all.
TCM has also showed ""The Whistler"" series starring Richard Dix but for some reason failed to include ""The Mark Of The Whistler"" and The 13th Hour.
It's time for a DVD release of the entire series.

Face of Marble is classic 1940's horror and yes the picture quality is dark but I believe that no better print exists- this is the print that you will see on TCM or anywhere, so no complaints from me.

I equally enjoyed both the Snake Woman and I Bury The Living.  Next on the list was the Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake. Last but not least of my favorites was The Face of Marble.

There were a lot of complaints about the movie qualities with four being on a DVD.  The only one that was pretty out of wacked in sound and quality to me was The Face of Marble.  It however, was still ok to watch.",1409875200,,605,4.0

5839761,4,B00DOZNGC2,"I would have preferred to have these films on separate discs in hi-def Blu-ray, but it's hard to squawk considering the affordable price. If you're looking for pristine quality reference prints for any of these four titles then keep on surfing. For a bargain hunter though, this 4-film collection is a cheap investment in fun. ;-)

I bought this primarily for ""I BURY THE LIVING,"" one of my all-time favorite horror films and the print here is decent. I already have ""THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE"" on one of those old MGM 'Midnight Movie' DVDs, so that one was a wash. ""THE SNAKE WOMAN"" was okay and also had a nice quality transfer, all things considered, (though I prefer Hammer's ""The Reptile,"" which has a similar plot). ""THE FACE OF MARBLE"" is a fun film and it was cool to see 'Long John' Carradine in one of his earlier genre roles. My only real gripe about it is the murky picture and garbled, hard to hear sound. A terrible, chewed-up source print = a frustrating viewing experience, unfortunately.

These are decent old school thrills & chills. Pop some popcorn, turn off the lights, pull down the shades, cuddle up in your favorite spot by the TV and enjoy some spooky thrills from an era where atmosphere, light & shadows and your imagination were king, instead of today's in-your-face CGI overkill, noisy explosions & gunfire, nonstop profanity and buckets of blood & torture porn gore. Remember kids, newer doesn't necessarily mean better. All 4 films are stuffed onto one single-sided disc so please be aware that there ARE compression issues (pixelation). 5 STARS for the films themselves, minus 1 STAR for the unspectacular print quality & compression glitches.

5839764,4,B00DOZNGC2,"I am addressing this review to any serious hard core collectors who want a quality print
of the snake woman, all previous releases were awful,almost unwatchable prints,
I know because I bought them, the print of the snake woman on this set is sharp,clear and has great sound, it is worth the price of the set alone,
""four skulls and I bury the living"" also are clean decent prints, (but they have been released before as nice prints, not the case with the snake woman),
I agree with other reviewers, the face of marble was taken from a badly damaged print,
(the sprockets were worn out so the film jumps through most of the movie),

You won't see them on TMC but are better than some of the movies

quality and I Bury the Living is a Classic must have! I had seen before.
Richard Boone takes over as a Caretaker of a Cemetary and whenever he
puts a pin in a plot the person dies! Nice mystery instead of horror.
I had not seen Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake with the great Henry
Daniels from Body Snatchers and many mystery and tv shows like
Thriller. It reminds me of an episode of Thriller. Very well written
and directed and Daniels is great as the mad doctor. The Snake
Woman reminds me of an early Hammer Production or British movie.
It's not as hokey as the Universal Cult of the Cobra which is still
a good movie but this one is a little better. All these movies are
much better than you usually get in one of these kind of collections.

5839767,4,B00DOZNGC2,"""The Face of Marble""--a fun voodoo-themed film, not essential for a study of the horror genre, but fun nonetheless!
""I Bury the Living""--I like this one. The plot twist at the end is idiot, but I enjoyed the premise (it should have been more).
""The 4 Skulls of Jonathan Drake""--Oh where oh where have these great pulp films gone? A fun scary movie (well, scary for its time) about a man plagued by a vengeful curse involving flying metaphysical skulls. Oh just watch it...
""The Snake Woman""--Watch it while inebriated...S. J. Furie directed some good horror films (1981's chilling ""The Entity"" is an example of a classic one) but this is an amateurish effort with a rather weak story to support its shock ambitions. It is an interesting curio to watch, but I didn't find it essential. Nonetheless, it's a passable snake-themed thriller.
This is a nice package and I am grateful to the MGM library, it's about time is all that I can say. These aren't the most essential buys, but I like the fact that they are rare, and I look forward to better releases in the future.",1389225600,,1067,4.621052631578947

I have a public domain version of I Bury The Living and it is hard to sit through at times. I am happy to report that the quality of this version is like day and night. Excellent!

5839773,4,B00DOZNGC2,"One of my film memories of childhood is ""The Face of Marble"".
In the early 50s, local TV stations were ""light"" on programming.
Since none of the major film companies had yet released any of their product to TV,
stations were forced to run films from PRC, Monogram, and other ""poverty-row""
film companies. ""The Face of Marble"" was one of those films that was repeatedly
aired, and it's strangeness made a lasting impression on me.
I've been looking for a decent copy of this film for several years,
and so, was delighted to see that ""The Face of Marble"" is part of this
4 movies set. It's not a perfect copy, but better than most I've seen previously.

5839775,4,B00DOZNGC2,"This review will focus on THE FACE OF MARBLE which is the one rare title in the set and was another seminal B movie horror from my childhood. It is also the only one of the 4 movies to have been made by Monogram, one of the legendary Poverty Row studios. A number of reviews have complained about the quality of the picture compared with the other three. It's definitely inferior but I'd be willing to bet that it may be the best there is. Monogram Pictures evolved into Allied Artists in the early 1950s and a number of Monogram titles (unless they were Bela Lugosi or the East Side Kids/Bowery Boys films) seem to only exist in worn 16mm prints. While not ideal, this print is way better than the various public domain VHS copies that I have had over the years. I'm sure this copy comes from the TCM library which usually has the best available prints. All 4 of these movies were released by or belong to United Artists whose movie library is now part of MGM whose films belong to Warner Brothers who owns virtually every old movie out there

Back to THE FACE OF MARBLE itself.  This Halloween, in addition to watching several Peter Cushing movies (in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth), I've been focusing on movies that made a big impact on me as a child and FACE OF MARBLE was one of them. This is one of John Carradine's early mad doctor roles and here he seems more unlucky than misguided. The idea of reviving the dead was a scary one to my young sensibilities and then for them to have the ""face of marble"" just totally spooked me as did the ghost dog Brutus. Even at that early age, I could feel the sense of doom and melancholy that pervades the film aided by a really downbeat background score. I felt sorry for Carradine as he really loved his wife and didn't deserve what happened to him. I knew Robert Shayne from the SUPERMAN TV series so there was a connecting thread that I could relate to. By then I was able to recognize performers from other shows and pictures. Watching it again brought back some of those childhood emotions. While the print may not be great, it IS great to have it on DVD along with the others in a nice, convenient package.",1383868800,4,2174,4.3654320987654325

I never saw these movies before and I think other people who like movies like I do would enjoy these.  I was surprised of the interesting story lines.  Yes, as interesting as can be for that time period.  This is one of my top favorite DVD's  now.",1492128000,,324,4.079365079365079
