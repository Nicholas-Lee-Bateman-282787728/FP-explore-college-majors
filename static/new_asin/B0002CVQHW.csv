The images get really distorted and I sent it back immediately.  Don't get discourage though, there are definitely better versions out there; I just don't know where.

BEWARE!! The dvd quality is absolutely horrific. This dvd is a copy. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON! Please find a better quality dvd elsewhere!

2076464,2,B0002CVQHW,"A very funny and enjoyable movie but didn't see much of the dancing or action as the copy is so pixelated (and runs at only 15 frames a second). It's all just a pixelated, jerky mess.

After sitting through two minutes of the film distibuter's (Eros) promotional material about how successful and great they are you'll find the actual quality of the copy is terrible - and obviously downloaded from the internet in 15-20 minute prices joined with a black space between each part. I'm seriously surprised I received something this bad from Amazon. In fact, I'd be disapointed if I picked up a pirate copy in a market this bad! The copy seems to be a VCD rather than a DVD because the counter stops working and just says 'play' rather than counting elasped time and chapters like DVDs do.

If you can find a better copy of the film I'd highly recommend it though. I'm a Shahrukh Khan fan and in this he is great. The Matrix influence is hillarious and the supporting characters wonderful.",1194652800,14,986,4.564971751412429
2076465,5,B0002CVQHW,"What fun this movie is! Three hours of counter-terrorist intrigue, crazy action sequences, and goofy campus hijinks breezed on by for me. Shahrukh Khan, whom I've only seen in full in DON (although I've seen him in a few cameo roles), is just about perfect as he walks that tightrope between intense and dedicated military man and silly, lovestruck undercover college boy. I think he pulls it off, and nicely.

Major Ram Prasad Sharma (Shahrukh Khan) loves his nation of India and dreams of when Project Milaap (""Unity"") will come to full fruition. However, Project Milaap, which is basically a prisoner exchange program intended to end Indian/Pakistani hostilities, is something which embittered Indian terrorist Raghavan (Sunil Shetty) hates with all his fiber and is something which he's vowed to sabotage at all costs. Indian Army General Bakshi, who heads the Milaap project, fears that his daughter Sanjana (Amrita Rao) might become a pawn between him and Raghavan and assigns Ram to protect her. Accordingly, Ram goes undercover as a student in Sanjana's college at St. Paul University. Oh, and, by the way, Ram is 31 years old and very much looks it. Thus, it's really no surprise that he soon becomes the brunt of many age jokes administered by his ""peers"" as he's mockingly called ""Uncle,"" ""Senior Citizen,"" and - my personal favorite - ""Mr. Geriatric."" Shortly enough, though, he wins the friendships of Sanjana and her brash and popular friend Lucky (Zayed Khan, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DUS-2-DVD-S/dp/B000EIKE4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DUS (2 DVD'S)</a>).

But Ram has a second important task. Further complicating the tale is Ram's father's deathbed revelation that Ram has a step-mother and -brother, with whom Ram's dad had been estranged for 20 years. His dying wish is that Ram seek them out so that familial fences can be mended. As luck would have it, and because this is Bollywood (home of serendipity and coincidences), Ram learns that his step-brother, Lakshman, also attends Sanjana's college.

Now, with Ram having been accepted by his college mates, another dilemma threatens to get in the way of his mission. He meets and is instantly smitten with and distracted by the sexy, new chemistry teacher Chandni Chopra (Sushmita Sen), who, to go by her constantly windblown tresses, seems to have her own personal wind machine. Can Ram keep his focus on point, defeat the bad guys, reconcile his long lost family, win the girl, and do his Physics homework? Well, yes, he can. The fun is in watching him do it.

So, MAIN HOON NA (""I'm Here Now"") starts out seriously enough as background is layed out concerning the all-important Project Milaap summit, the ensuing terrorist attack, and the resulting death of Ram's father. Also, the film has to initially set up Shahrukh's action hero creds so as to better provide a contrast with his later quasi-nerdy college persona. However, as soon as Ram shows up at the St. Paul campus, the film switches up and becomes a madcap comedy, replete with broad humor and over the top slapstick. I enjoyed it, and got a kick out of the violinists who kept popping up every time anything remotely romantic was going on. The spit spraying professor was also a gas. However, the badly caricatured characters of the forgetful principal and the much avoided, English-mangling school spinster had me yawning.

Unlike films such as ASAMBHAV, GADAR, and ZAMEEN, MAIN HOON NA doesn't wallow in much Pakistan-bashing. Too, the nationalistic rah-rahs are kept to a minimum. Film choreographer and first time director Farah Khan, along with producer Shahrukh Khan, maintains an even keeled movie, which is always an accomplishment in Bollywood pictures when one factors in all the different genres normally thrown in the stewpot. But, no scene is too jarring here, despite the mishmash of wirework action, Indian-Pakistani intrigue, family melodrama, and college goofiness. Oh, and musical interludes. Speaking of which, these songs are infectiously fun, from the title tune to the energetic ""Chale Jaise Hawayein"" to the Latin-flavored ""Tumhe Jo Maine Dekha"" to ""Tumse Mil Ke Dil Ka Jo Haal"" (Qawali), with its awesome beats, to the retro-cool ""Gori Gori,"" which is reminiscent of GREASE in its exuberance. I don't do this much, but I'm probably gonna buy the movie soundtrack. By the way, since we're talking music here, I could've sworn I heard the warped strains of the Austin Powers and Mission: Impossible theme songs in certain scenes.

Shahrukh Khan is excellent and has me finally, finally convinced of his star quality. And he's working with a good bunch of actors here. The sensuous Sushmita Sen (whose movies I really need to start checking out) embodies that hot teacher every male youngster must've lusted after in school, at one point or another. Amrita Rao is the tomboyish Sanjana, who wears her heart on her sleeve, and she makes me wish she were my friend. She's a promising young actress. Zayed Khan also punches in to work and is pretty good, although I could've done with much less of the lame Karate Kid moves. Sunil Shetty surprises me the most as he actually demonstrates depth and complexity in his terrorist role. After seeing him in crap performances, who knew he had it in him to be good? As an added bonus, Naseeruddin Shah has a brief but key supporting part as Ram's military father.

This paragraph is as good as any to mention the dvd itself. The dvd version I have is the 2-disc set, with disc one containing the feature film and the 2nd disc having these following special features: a trivia game (I missed 3 questions the first time, darn it); Farah Khan & Shahrukh Khan's filmography; a story board to scene comparison; ""The Making Of"" featurette (around 28 minutes long, but worth watching); 6 minutes of deleted scenes; outtakes & bloopers (worth it for the hilarious spit scenes); a visual effects segment; and TV spots, song trailers, & theatrical trailer. Not bad.

MAIN HOON NA started out boringly, with the ponderous Mission Milaap meeting. But, stick with it, it gets better  as we're soon treated to some interesting action sequences. And, then, with Ram showing up in campus half an hour into it, the movie really takes off and quickly ingratiates itself with the viewer. Honestly, from then on, there's a sense of joy in this film which made me feel good all the way to the end with its high spirited closing credits. The main actors have great chemistry together and seem to be having a blast, and, if you go by the ""Making Of"" featurette, this sense of camaraderie was conveyed off the screen as well. The fight scenes are nicely choreographed, even if the film aims too much for MATRIX-like special effects, a goal of which it falls short. Some of the wirework really, really look unconvincing; they even used wire for the cycle rickshaw stunt. However, there's one scene between one professor and Ram in the teacher's lounge which makes hilarious use of the MATRIX effect. But, for me, the enjoyment in the film doesn't really lie in the action bits.

Even with the sometimes shabby dvd quality (the screen got extremely ""pixelized"" in several scenes), this is still a movie well worth having. I've seen it twice in the last three days, and, truth be told, the action sequences may have gotten old, the f/x become cheesier, but the college moments retain their freshness and sense of playfulness and Ram's interactions with Lucky and his mom remain touching (and, yes, hokey). Four and a half stars for MAIN HOON NA. Would that all Bollywood films be this effervescent.",1184889600,19,7623,4.990558615263572

2076484,4,B0002CVQHW,"This 2004 movie is director Farah Khan's first directorial effort, She also choreographed it; she said she would never consider making it without then 39 year old Shah Rhuk Khan; and she wanted it to have EVERYTHING: love story, music, dancing, and action. She succeeded completely! The four stars is because I am American and Americans need a little bit more reality in their action sequences. These sequences often lapse into the more cartoonish Bollywood variety of action (Shah Rhuk, as the army's top commando, virtually flying while shooting terrorists, capturing terrorists, or rescuing a student from a campus rooftop). Four stars is also for the somewhat heavy handed hammering home of the central point of unification, in the exchange of Pakistani and Indian prisoners. David Lean was more the director for doing that job subtly, poignantly and convincingly. But the movie succeeds admirably on most levels, is very effectively directed and is highly enjoyable nonetheless. The human relationships and dialogue are poignant and funny, the three lead actors turn in wonderful performances, and the choreography is first rate. The new physics teacher (indeed all the teachers) and the lead terrorist are more caricature than character; the teacher is done to great comic effect, complete with wind blowing in her hair, even indoors (and she is gorgeous), but the terrorist actor seems to lack the skill to pull off the role with any subtlety. The opening dance sequence is a real hoot, on campus in Darjeeling, with the snow capped Himalayas shining beautifully in the background. This is a very rewarding movie experience, especially since I was able to locate an out of print copy of the two disc version made in 2005 WITHOUT ALL THE ANNOYING ADVERTISEMENTS everyone is complaining about. That was a real plus. Also the making of featurette on the second disc is subtitled, which is a real plus for non-Hindi speakers like me.

2076509,5,B0002CVQHW,"""Main Hoon Na"" (a slang phrase best translated as ""I'm here for you"") is celebrated choreographer Farah Khan's 2004 directorial debut, made possible by star Shah Rukh Khan forming his own production house, Red Chillies, to get backing for her.  At first glance, the plot seems pretty straight forward:  elite Special Forces Major Ram (Shah Rukh Khan) saves General Bakshi (Kabhir Bedi) from a terrorist attack launched by Hindu fanatic Raghav (Suniel Shetty), but loses his father, Colonel Sharma (Naseerudin Shah), who reveals as he lays dying that Ram has a half-brother, Lakhsman, and a step-mother who rejected him twenty years before;  Ram promises to deliver his father's ashes to his lost family, and is planning to search for them when General Bakshi asks Ram to go protect his daughter Sanjana (Amrita Rao) at her university.  Ram is reluctant until the general confides that he knows all about his friend Sharma's past, and also knows that Ram's younger brother is a student at the same university;  Ram then agrees to go, but is dismayed to find out that Sanjana hates her father and all things military, so he must go undercover as a student, to be close enough to guard her.  Pretending to be a college drop-out returning ten years later, Ram is so completely out of his element that he finds his nerves of steel turning into nerdy style;  not surprisingly, Sanjana responds to Ram's awkward attempts to befriend her by asking her best friend Lucky (Zayed Khan) to please rescue her from Ram's attentions.  Lucky is a happy slacker who derides Ram by calling him ""uncle"";  Ram thinks Lucky is an annoying waste of space--until he discovers that Lucky is actually his brother Lakhsman, just before he has to spring into action and save the kid from falling off a roof to his death.  Lucky, Sanjana, and the college kids hail Ram as a hero, and work to change their new friend from geek to sleek when he becomes enamored of math professor Miss Chandini (Sushmita Sen);  Ram revels in his first ever social success, but his happiness is tempered by the knowledge that his true identity as Lucky's illegitimate brother and Sanju's army guard would rip their world apart if revealed.  Treading carefully, Ram works to ingratiate himself with Lucky and his mother (Kirron Kher) while protecting Sanjana from Raghav's threat--a shadow that gains substance when Raghav and his men set up secret headquarters near the university.

Farah Khan's intent with ""Main Hoon Na"" was to present the ultimate masala (spicy stew) film, which is why it turns from action to college comedy to romance to family drama and back again, bouncing like a ping pong ball before the first half is even over.  Since Bollywood films have classically been designed to be an evening's entertainment, functioning for the Indian audience the way Shakespeare's plays did for Elizabethan England and opera for Europe during the Empire period, they have always combined many elements in each film: romance, comedy, drama, action, and music.  By their very definition, films labeled as Bollywood must be masalas, so Farah's idea was nothing new in itself--but the execution of an idea is everything, and it was Farah's to mix the standard elements in a new way, both echoing the films she watched growing up and advancing the political views she--and, not surprisingly, Shah Rukh--hold dear.  Political viewpoints are never really absent from any Indian film, and in the Khans', being a loyal and patriotic Indian means trusting the heart and soul of the country enough to make religious and cultural differences a matter of celebration rather than civil strife, and most particularly to view Hindustanis and Pakistanis as one people separated by artificial borders. For them, avoiding conflict and proffering the hand of friendship is an intellectual reunification which could spark a form of cooperation along the lines of Canada and the U.S.

This plays strongly in ""Main Hoon Na"", not only with General Bakshi's ""Project Milaap"" and the depiction of the terrorists as misguided Indian fanatics, rather than the stereotypical rogue Pakistanis, but also in the secondary story of the illegitimate offspring seeking family unity. In the same way, even though many particulars from Hinduism are used to both comic and tragic effect (Lucky's first entrance into the library is loaded with temple rituals; the family reunion is sparked by the need to complete a funeral rite; and most especially the brothers Ram and Lakshman are named from the sacred myths of the Ramayana), the emphasis here is on spirituality rather than religiosity.  Amongst the college students, no sectarian differences exist--even though close examination reveals that Ram and Lucky are Hindu, General Bakshi and his daughter Sanjana are Sikh, while Percy may be Christian (as is the college itself), and others Muslim and Parsee. There is an overt and deliberate identification of the villain not only as a Hindu, but even bearing the name of Raghavan, a famous villain in Hindu mythology, while his cohort who ultimately reverts to the side of good is not only called the very Muslim name Khan, but also uses the standard Urdu phrase 'Khuda hafiz' (God be with you) to leave Ram--this is clearly meant to undermine the stereotypes of past patriotic action films,  where the villain was usually a Pakistani or Arab Muslim, while the main hero was, of course, Hindu.

Farah Khan is probably the most innovative choreographer in Bollywood, so she would certainly pull out all the stops for her own film. To make a splash with ""Main Hoon Na"", Farah designed the opening number as essentially a two shot piece: the first half of the song (Sanjana's part) is one continuous steadicam move, then a few inter-cuts of story moves to the second half (Lucky`s arrival), again filmed in one steadicam move; from a production, as well as an artistic, standpoint, this is an incredible feat, involving hundreds of dancers doing intricate moves for several minutes, allowing for no mistakes. Farah also wanted to pay tribute to the films she has grown up with, which included not only Bollywood musicals from the `70s and `80s, but also the Hong Kong New Wave films of John Woo and Jackie Chan that took the world by storm in the mid-1980s.  Consequently, Major Ram shows up to college disguised as a civilian in pure 1970's clothes, until he is updated by Lucky, while Miss Chandini always carries a journal to match her polka dot sari, a direct tribute to Dimple Kapadia in 1981`s ""Bobby"", the first real Indian teenage movie. The casting of the classic comedienne Bindu as Mrs. Kakka, with her pretentious misuse of English, honors the actress' long career. The illegitimate son suddenly showing up is a reference to ""Masoom"" (innocent), a classic 1980 film starring Naseerudin Shah, who here plays a variation of the same father role.  The songs played in background and sung by Ram on a dare are from the same era in films, and the prom song, ""Gauri Gauri,"" is modeled after the Beatles send-up performed by iconoclast Shammi Kapoor in 1968's ""Jaanwar"".

Farah gave action director Allan Amin and Shah Rukh Khan carte blanche to create the stunts, and, despite some ""Matrix"" jokes, they paid both comic and serious tribute to Jackie Chan and John Woo with their work: the tongue-in-cheek pedicab chasing an SUV bit is an amalgam of Chan stunts from his ""Police Story"" films, while the opening TV show attack and all gunplay is modeled after John Woo, including the use of doves in the climactic fight. The wirework throughout, as well as the ""Matrix"" references, honor the great Yuen Woo-ping, a Hong Kong legend who also created the acrobatics of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Shah Rukh did most of his own stunts, and contributed so many ideas (the ""sorry about the sari"" sequence and line are his), that he was given a special ""thrills by..."" credit.  Action hero Suniel Shetty does a rare turn as a villain, playing the terrorist with such dimension that he manages to garner sympathy.  Miss Universe 1995, Sushmita Sen, has the unique opportunity as voluptuous Miss Chandini to seduce Shah Rukh Khan as the romantically diffident Ram; typically it is SRK who does the romancing, with such strong sensuality that he could make love to a stone column, but here Major Ram is the stone.  Mention must also be made of dueling comic actors Boman Irani as the absent-minded college president, and Satish Shah as the spitting science teacher, who round out the excellent cast.  As always in Bollywood films, many of the jokes and bits of homage will go right over the head of non-Indian viewers, but what does translate is a story that is by turns exciting, funny, romantic, and touching.

The actual Eros DVD of the film has some problems, due to the idiotic way the company chose to transfer in time blocks, making the picture freeze for a few seconds between blocks, and resetting the counter each time;  it is also impossible to reverse ""across"" the blocks, making the whole thing seem like a pirated copy.  Unless you can find a version out of India by a reputable company like Shemaroo, the best bet is the first Eros release, the deluxe two disc edition which is also a photo book; that edition has fewer problems, and also a great little book to look at.",1357430400,2,9301,4.905732484076433

Then you get more advertisements for other movies. Then comes the cheesy music in the opening credits. The action in the opening scene is hilarious. It reminds me of a lousy Hong Kong movie. Oh, and did you know that when somebody is shot with a pistol bullet they fly back through a glass door? Imagine what would happen to the shooter if this were reality? You know that pesky physics stuff: For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. Finally, the EROS label sticks in the upper left corner 90% of the time, like a music video or TV show. We couldn't watch more than about 20 minutes, after fast forwarding through the first dance number, which was terribly choreographed and the music was irritating. The lyrics were worse.

2076512,5,B0002CVQHW,"This is one of my most favorite films with Shah Rukh Khan in it. You get to see a wide spectrum of his talents...from being the most brave and skillful military man...to trying to fit in as a college student...to being love-sick over a beautiful girl...to being an ideal son, brother, and friend. He is a hero in every way to me and this film captures a lot of the reasons I feel that way. I love the music, dancing, story, and especially the fantastic heroic moments with Shah Rukh Khan either saving someone or getting the bad guys. The final explosions on the roof as Shah Rukh Khan ran were the BEST!!!",1335312000,,606,4.371681415929204
2076513,4,B0002CVQHW,"This is an action adventure with LOTS of CGI and some fun humor and laugh out loud comedy running through it . I see almost two totally different movies in one with a common thread being SRK as the long separated brother. The opening consist of action and tragedy with an ex commando turned terrorist gunning down Military and tv crew gathered to discuss a Pakistani/ Indian prisoner exchange on national t.v.. SRK fatheR a superior officer who is present, is gunned down and is bleeding out in his arms when he dumps the missing relative bomb on him.... Rams father has another son and a wife, he ask him to go find that son/ missing brother and together scatter his ashes as a family reunited.  SRK iS ordered by his  Commanding General to  find and protect his daughter (Sanju) at a college she  attends. His mission is to go undercover as a student to  protect her from a possible kidnap or vendetta slaying by the ex commando. He is than told as an incentive of sorts that his brother is at the same college as well. This is all done I would say in the first 20 min. or so of the movie.

Phasing into the next portion , Ram arrives at the college by the vehicle of humor,dance and a small taste of the unrequited love that Sanju the generals daughter has for the resident rascal Lucky. The colleges Caricature teachers are present for hilarity and the new emotion of love comes out of Ram in some of SRK's funniest moments yet on film. This section of the movie never lags and is good story progression. For fans of Farah Khan there is a fantastic use of color and gorgeous outfits for the dance number when Lucky  finally falls in love and the prom scenes and SRK's daydream romance scenes for fun are excellent proof she can direct as well as choreograph . There are some  action scenes continued during the college scenario with everything from roof chases , skirmishes, bets , dares etc. Very lighthearted.

The close of the movie is interspersed with family drama and overlays of hostage taking and hostage freeing. Very well blended moments and in quick spurts.( Oh the poor little sari, it sacrificed all. Cool scene. no nudity) . I don't think children would have a problem with this movie . For safe bet on possible age groups you need to view it first of course, but it's all action adventure style good guys vs bad guys.",1333929600,,2336,4.477647058823529

You can tell if you've gotten a bad copy by the following:  If the upper right-hand corner has ""Movies on Demand"" written on it, and the back has the words ""Akai""  and ""Air-Tel"" written in red, then just send it back without opening it.  Also, the dvd case is cheap cardboard rather than plastic.

It's called ""take it up with the seller who sold it to you!"" or ""right a bad review about the seller"" don't take it out on the movie itself. I too have come across a very similar problem when I ordered the movie ""Duplicate"" but instead of writing a bad review about the movie I contacted the seller and they sent me a new copy free of charge that worked perfectly.

So about the movie... ""Main Hoon Na"" was a load of laughs for me. The action scenes were extremely cheesy and a little too overdone but other than that the movie was very entertaining. In the beginning Shahrukh Khan is portrayed as a very good soldier (or as I like to say a bad @SS) but when he meets a certain lady in the movie he totally turns into a love struck little boy and it's so adorable and funny. So please ignore the bad reviews and give this movie a chance. Because I enjoy it more and more every time I watch it. And if by chance you receive a bad copy just contact the seller about it, a good seller is usually quick to fix the problem. To avoid this you might try ordering the 2disc copy.",1286409600,,1179,4.103896103896104
2076528,2,B0002CVQHW,"Main Hoon Na stars Major Ram Prasad Sharma (Shahrukh Kahn) in a drama, comedy, and music romance with splash of slapstick Matrix-like action.  Major Ram has two challenging goals to complete, one concerning his family and the other regarding his country.  The governments of India and Pakistan have launched ""Project Milaap"", where both the governments will release the POWs from the previous wars.  While ambassadors from India and Pakistan are trying to implement Project Milaap during a televised conference, a terrorist attack occurs.  The conspirator of the attack, Raghavan (Suneil Shetty) hits Brigadier Shekhar Sharma (Nasseerudin Shah), Major Ram's father, with a stray bullet.  While on his deathbed Ram's father confesses to Ram that his wife and son had left him many years ago due to his infidelity. He tells Ram his last wish: his family be reunited under one roof.  Ram is also presented with another mission: it is his duty to infiltrate the college of his commanding officer's daughter, Sanjana (Amrita Rao), and protect her from the clutches of evil Raghavan and his terrorist group.  Ram must enter Sanjana's high fun, little study college incognito as an elderly student trying to complete his studies.
The main theme the movie portrays is nationalism.  One example is the reasoning behind General Amarjeet Bakshi's (Kabir Bedi) mission for Ram to protect his daughter, Sanjana.  He explains to Ram that feels extremely guilty and disappointed in himself for basically disregarding Sanjana since she was born.  General Bakshi wanted a son to follow in his footsteps of the military.  This shows how devoted the army is to their native country.  To add to that, the death of Ram's father motivates Ram to fulfill his mission to find and reunite his lost family members, while at the same time protecting and being loyal to his country.
One scene that really caught my attention was when Ram and Lucky (Zayed Kahn), Ram's stepbrother and his mother are at Lucky's house and Lucky starts to talk to about his father.  He starts to yell, ""Can you hear me?"" and ""You don't even care when I fail!""  It shows how much disrespect he has for his father and the army, because Lucky relates the two and heavily implies they both never did anything for him.  Upon hearing this, Ram gets emotional because Lucky is highly disrespecting the army.  Even though Lucky and Ram are of the same father, Ram's sense of nationalism takes over his feelings of sorrow for his father.  He shows that the army and his country come first.
The matrix-like camera angles really caught my attention.  Even though they weren't aimed to be realistic, it really spiced up the action scene in the beginning of the movie for me.  These camera angles also put high attention on the dramatic death of Ram's father.  The bullet shot by Raghavan ricocheted of one of the television cameras and hit him in his chest.  This was one of the biggest parts in the film and the slow-motion effects really brought it to my attention that the death of this man would heavily impact the rest of the movie.
Overall, I think Shahrukh Kahn looks out of place impersonating as a student in college.  Also it is odd that begins indulging in fun and pleasure right away at school when his father just passed a couple days before.  He goes from happy to sad and from trying to carry out his missions to daydreaming and singing about one of his professors.  It takes away from the main themes and from the action/thriller genre in general.  Be prepared for over an hour of combined song and dance mixed with mediocre action scenes.",1256428800,,3595,4.825448613376835
2076529,4,B0002CVQHW,"Main Hoon Na, directed by Farah Khan, is about Major Ram Sharma (Shahrukh Khan) who wants to ensure that the government's plan to end the feud between Pakistan and India, Mission Milaap (Project Unity) is completed. However Raghavan (Sunil Shetty), a well-known terrorist, will do anything to prevent the completion of Mission Milaap. His plan to keep it from happening is to threaten the army general's daughter, Sanjana (Amrita Ra). Major Ram enrolls at the college that Sanjana is attending so he will be able to protect her, but doing so he finds out that his unknown half brother, Lakshman or Lucky (Zayed Khan) attends the same college. Now Ram has the task of watching over Sanjana and getting to know his family that his father has kept from him. He also tried to make his gorgeous chemistry teacher, Chandni (Sushmita Sen) fall in love with him.
 The theme of Main Hoon Na is nationalism. When Ram is placed in the college he has all the tasks of protecting the general's daughter to getting closer with his family to falling in love with his chemistry teacher. But he always completes his mission no matter what the consequences. At the end of the film, Ram protects the entire college from Raghavan, even though his family doesn't accept him and was discovered as a undercover student and was told to leave. This shows that he would do anything for his country and family, even if it involves a duel between him and Raghavan.
 There is a lot of new cinematography that is used in Main Hoon Na. The main shot I noticed was the low angle shot whenever Ram was saving someone's life. The first scene I noticed this in; Ram and his friends are going to the movies and Ram notices that the terrorists are targeting one of his friends. A low angled shot is used while Ram is running to save his friend. Also, to show the impact of the heroism of Ram it was captured in slow motion during the saving. This mechanism is used a lot when Ram was saving someone's life. Another thing I noticed a lot in the movie was when Ram's love interest was in the scene, her hair was always blowing, showing her beauty. Whenever Chandni was in the scene the close up of Ram's face was showing that he was in a trance because of her beauty. Her hair moving continuously through out the movie was because the main character was in love with her and also, to show her beauty.
 I did not enjoy Main Hoon Na at all. I thought the music was way to long and did not fit into the action genre of the movie. Also whenever there was a battle scene the action was very unrealistic. I found that whenever someone was shooting they were flying through the air and would jump through glass doors. I also thought that the fighting scenes were way to choreographed and didn't flow correctly. I give this movie two thumbs or guns down.",1256428800,,2807,4.489236790606654
2076530,4,B0002CVQHW,"The movie Main Hoon Na, directed by Farah Khan, is an action packed, thriller that keeps the audience intrigued with its fight sequences and dramatizations. This modern day action film's main characters include Ram Prasad Sharma (Shahrukh Khan) and Chandni (Sushmita Sen).
 This film tells the story of the ambitious project Mission Milap to someday become a reality, bringing together two countries. General Amerjet Bakshi is in charge of this mission and has enemies who would do anything to see Mission Milap fail putting his daughter, Sanjana, in danger. Ram is also attending the same school as his half brother Lucky who he was separated from at a very young age.
 Main Hoon Na is very different from the other Bollywood films that I have seen because  it is an action film. Other Bollywood films that I have watched have little to no action in them and are centered on the theme of romance. There are stunts that Ram and Lucky perform that are very dangerous. For example, in one scene when Lucky is falling off of the school's roof and Ram saves him. This scene shows a great downward angle shot of Lucky looking at Ram and an upward angle shot of Ram looking at Lucky. The look in Lucky's eyes helps the viewer feel the fear Lucky had of falling to his death. One can also feel the hidden trust he had in Ram and the security he felt with his life being in Ram's hands.
 While at the school, Ram serenades the chemistry teacher, Chandni, in the school yard on a dare. During this scene, an over the shoulder shot is used to focus on Ram while he is singing and Chandni is listening with her back toward him. Later, Ram goes to apologize to Chandni for serenading her and is faced with the physics teacher who has a spitting problem. To avoid the spit, Ram has to do this action, matrix like move which is slowed down and dramatized to show a better effect. A similar move is also done in the courtyard of the school when Ram sees the people who are after Sanjana. Ram is soaring through the air trying to avoid the bullet and the cinematography used for the scene is a track shot as he flies and is slowed down.  Later when Ram is falling in love with Chandni, they are shown singing a song by the water. An above shot is shown while Chandni lies on the log and Ram is singing to her. This shot helps to show them both together and makes the chemistry that is beginning to blossom clearer.
 Towards the end of the film, one of the men who are after Sanjana comes to the school and pretends to be the new physics teacher. Sanjana is brought to her father's safety by Ram, where she is told that her father sent Ram to protect her. The film also goes on to show the love that has grown between Ram and Chandni, especially now that Chandni knows he isn't a real student. As a gut wrenching twist, Ram goes home to find the new ""physics teacher"" telling Lucky and his mom who Ram really is and how Lucky and Ram are half brothers. Ram then goes on to tell them that their father died and he came to tell them he loved them and to try to be accepted into their family. An above shot is shown here to show the whole room, so that the viewer can see Lucky and his mom reacting to the news as Ram leaves to go back to the Army. Before he returns to the Army, Ram must help his classmates and teachers who have been captured by the people who were after Sanjana.
 Main Hoon Na is a compelling, action packed film that leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat. The cinematography and action stunts help to capture the audiences and to keep them involved throughout the entire film. The film also incorporates the romantic theme, as well, which helps the film come alive and seem more realistic.",1256428800,,3696,4.355587808417997
2076531,5,B0002CVQHW,"Main Hoon Na, directed by Farah Khan, is a spectacular film with a little bit of everything in it.  Ranging from action to romance with a slight twist of comedy, it will suit anyone looking to see a good film no matter what genre you prefer.  The film begins as General Amarjeet Bakshi's (Kabir Bedi) of India is speaking about Project Milaap, an attempt to end the war between India and Pakistan.  The problem is that not everyone wants the war to end such as the terrorist Raghavan (Sunil Shetty), former Indian army officer.  Suddenly, as the general is speaking, a shooting erupts from terrorists including Raghavan.  In attempt to kill the general, Brigadier Shekhar Sharma (Naseeruddin Shah) sacrifices himself and takes the bullet.  While on his deathbed he confesses to his son Major Ram Sharma (Shah Rukh Khan) that his wife left him with his other son because of his past mistakes and reveals his last wish- to have both of his sons throw his ashes into the river.  The attacks from Raghavan continue as he is threatening to kill General Bakshi's daughter Sanjana (Amrita Rao).  The general sends his best, Major Ram, to protect his daughter.  Major Ram thinks that this is going to delay his journey to find his long lost brother until he learns that Sanjana and his brother Laxman Prasad Sharma (Zayed Khan), aka Lucky, attend the same college.  So Major Ram poses as a student in Sanjana's class and the journey to save his country as well as find his brother begins.

 Farah Khan did a great job at directing this film.  The movie begins with an action scene, where the matrix-style stunts are shown in slow-motion and the background music is a popular tune from mission impossible; repetitive in every action scene throughout the film. The full length and long shots emphasized the action scenes as well. The use of song in Main Hoon Na is essential because it often introduced main characters such as Sanjana and Lucky. Also, when Lucky finally realizes his love for Sanjana, song is used to express it.  In the end of the film, Major Ram brought his family together, saved 100 students held hostage by Raghavan, fell in love, and formed incredible friendships with Lucky and Sanjana along with other students. It is obvious that Major Ram is the hero and the low-angle shots reflect he was doing something heroic.

 Although there were a lot of things to follow throughout the film, I never lost interest.  Love, comedy, and action are my favorite genres and I was excited to see the strong sense of each throughout the film.  Farah Khan is an impressive director and I would recommend others to see Main Hoon Na.",1256256000,,2630,4.717724288840262

2076533,5,B0002CVQHW,"This is one of my favorites. It is a celebration of a mix of well-loved Hollywood genres. You have the romance, the college with the adult undercover as a student and you have action - with a little comedy thrown in. The songs and dances are memorable and SRK is great. Zayed Khan is I think the best I have seen him to date, and Amrita Rao a very apt romantic young woman. Sunil Shetty as the major deluded terrorist who wants to invade the school and kidnap the girl, is so good he's troubling!
There are many salutes to Hollywood cliches here and the music really grew on me (enough to seek out and download). There is some violence but very Hollywood in its action sequences rather than graphic and nasty.
The cover makes this look old fashioned or dated (as SRK has been dressed 'square' as the older male returning to school) but it is very contemporary and westernized. Definitely recommended. Even my daughter raced out and ordered a copy after seeing it too so it appeals to different age groups.
I was surprised by many reviews knocking this - though mostly often for DVD quality (The film DVD quality of my copy was fine!) Looking elsewhere on the Net it tends to get above average .
