8131515,4,B000GFRIA4,"First, let me say.. THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS MOVIE! It's for mature audiences. It's an adult twist on the childrens version of cinderella. It's good for viewing after the children have gone to bed.",1243555200,6,196,4.628571428571429
8131516,1,B000GFRIA4,"Save your money and time. I didn't think I would ever see another movie worse than 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', but this one would run a very close second. I didn't even make it to the end of this God-awful celluloid disaster. Your first tip that dark times are ahead is the title, which leads you to beleive the year is 2000. But the film makes it clear it's the year 2047......

The acting is campy, and most of the women aren't very attractive. The lovely Catherine Erhardt was the only jewel in the crown, and not enough to save this film from boring. As Cinderella, she lives with her stepmother...a screaching, horny old hag...and two stepsisters, both of which look like a couple of hooker rejects from a truckstop in lower Alabama (with sincere apologies to anyone from that great state).

Since it's the future and sex is taboo, Cinderella is rather clueless about such things. Enter her intergalactic fairy godfather....and the word 'fairy' should be applied figurativley and literally in this case.. who shows up to give her hope and a bizarre crash course in love. Including two people dressed in bunny suits and masks simulating sex. People in animal suits bumping uglies is more disturbing than funny. What the heck were they smoking when they made this???

Those caught fornicating in the future sexless society are shrunken to doll size, as shown with a young couple trying to get their groove on. And here a great erotic opportunity was lost. Imagine the visual impact of a 6-inch high male having to pleasure a full-size female, or vice-versa. But that wasn't possible....that may have pushed the film into the x-rated realm, and secondly, the money obviously wasn't there for such effects. In fact, the money wasn't there for much of anything, most clearly seen in the cheesy sets of cardboard and plastic.

Last but not least, you're introduced to Roscoe. Quite possibly one of the most annoying characters ever created for a motion picture. Part of the Fornication Police, he's a robot who constantly repeats things and whines on and on in high-pitched voice that sounds like a cross between the Chipmunks and a doper huffing helium.

A waste of time and money. Watching the previews on this DVD, I should've opted for 'Blazing Stewardesses' or 'Nurse Sherri'.

My verdict? Somebody should have flushed this cinematic floater before it ever made it to the public.",1202428800,11,2388,4.840686274509804
8131517,2,B000GFRIA4,"Low budget sex movie from the late 70's. Might has been exiting then, but
by today's standards it is quite boring,,,stupid robot. The sexy Alice
in Wonderland was much better.",1199404800,8,175,4.866666666666666
8131518,5,B000GFRIA4,"The first is ""Alice in Wonderland"".

Great job with the transfer.",1196294400,8,135,4.230769230769231
