8048466,1,B0007LFQ74,"This video was not fun at all for me or baby.  There was no music, and it seems like she just taped it in her basement.  I agree that it was not interactive with the baby at all.",1175558400,,178,3.6578947368421053
8048467,2,B0007LFQ74,"I was really disappointed with this video. The only positive is that it does give a good arm workout (my arms were sore the next day), which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Oh, and the video is broken into two 15-minute workouts that can be done separately. Specific negatives:

--It looks like a home video shot at the local gym. The setting is literally an aerobic room at a gym. There is no music at all. And the instructor is really blah. All this adds up to very boring!

--Most of the exercises are not interactive with baby. Rather, baby sits on your belly during crunches or on your lap while you use free weights to do arm exercises.

--The ab exercises are really repetitive.

I have other mom & baby dvds and I know I am not likely to use this one again. The other videos I have involve a lot more involvement of baby in the exercises (e.g., lifting him for arm exercises, doing ""airplane"" with him on my legs for abs) which my son loves - it makes me look forward to working out with him and that motivates me. He was really bored and restless during this dvd. The other videos I've used also have gorgeous outdoor settings and music - just overall more interesting to look at. I definitely do not recommend this one.",1173139200,6,1248,4.27542372881356
8048468,5,B0007LFQ74,"I have been doing the abdominal workout with my son, Benjamin and we really enjoy it a lot. Ben thinks it's funny that mommy is making funny faces while doing those crunches.

I love how Kira and her daughter work out in a simple, home like setting. The workout looks simple but believe me with a baby sitting on your belly/legs it can be really challenging. My son is 4 months old now and the length of the abdominal workout is just right for him he would probably get fussy if it was any longer (and probably mommy too:))

We haven't really tried the upper body excercises with the weights but they also look like a good workout.",1143158400,,631,4.338983050847458
8048469,5,B0007LFQ74,"As a mommy of a 6 month old, I don't always have time to make it to the gym, but by doing this at home and involving him, it not only got me back in shape, but allowed some one-on-one quality time with my son.  I highly recommend all of Kira's videos!  As I had stated in another review, these make wonderful shower gifts too!!!!",1139011200,,329,4.046153846153846
8048470,5,B0007LFQ74,"I love Kira's workouts! Even though I have no children, I got this one for the 15-minute ab workout. I use a dumbell weight instead of a baby for a harder workout. These are great exercises! And to be honest, watching Kira's baby participating during the workout is a riot!  I do the arm workout with both arms instead of the one-arm at a time as shown. It's great when I am short on time because it hits all my main trouble spots!",1134086400,,431,4.192771084337349
8048471,5,B0007LFQ74,I love Kira's workouts! This one really challenged my abs! I also got some some good upper body strength from it.  The 15-minute workout is just enough to fit into my busy schedule!,1125446400,,181,4.484848484848484
8048472,5,B0007LFQ74,We thought this video was great for new Moms to get back into it after having a baby!!,1124323200,,86,3.8333333333333335
8048473,5,B0007LFQ74,"Exercise with your baby (or without)!
Get those abs back with a 15-minute ab workout of crunches, planks and more! Firm the arms with a another 15-minute workout that can be done with your baby on your lap! (Great for those with sleepy babies that don't want to be put down!)

I designed these two workouts after seeing how much my baby enjoyed (giggled at me) seeing me do pushups and crunches! Babies make good weight resistance too!

Not just for moms! I have had several people tell me they enjoy the workouts without the baby too!
