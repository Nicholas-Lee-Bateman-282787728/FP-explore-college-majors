1958913,5,B0000YEDYU,"I have long wondered where evolution would take many creatures. The Future Is Wild was a fun, thought provoking look at what the future could be like. Many of the creatures shown did seem plausible to me. I  saw this on tv when it originally aired and was thoroughly entertained. When I found it here for sale I had to have it.

1958922,5,B0000YEDYU,"""The Future Is Wild"" is a rather cool concept for a program.  There's tons of dinosaur themed documentaries out there that look at ancient fauna and their evolution, but this is really the only show I've seen that speculates about the future.  Obviously, it's not a real ""documentary"" in the literal sense because it's 100% speculative fiction, but it is scientifically informed speculation, so it's quite interesting and fun.

The whole premise of ""The Future Is Wild"" is that humans are gone from earth and the audience now gets to see what might happen in the evolution of the remaining animals there.  The DVD series is quite long (about 5 hours total) and spans as far as 200 million years into the future.  The imaginative views of what new animals would evolve over time are quite interesting, but obviously there's no way to know how true they would be because something as huge as evolution that far into the future would be very difficult to predict.  Still, the scientists who worked with the film makers do stop to give exposition about their reasoning behind a particular animal and what it evolved from and why, and I appreciated these segments.  Overall, I felt that the explanations and reasoning given for certain animal designs were pretty sound, but that the names given to the animals were pretty silly (""Phlish"" and ""Slither Suckers"").  To be fair though, that's the sort of names that people would give to new animals - just very descriptive ones.  Some of them still sound pretty silly though.  As for any other complaints I have...  I'm annoyed that the DVDs don't have a ""play all"" option.  You have to select and play each episode (4 per disc) individually.  That was a bit more inconvenient, but not a deal breaker or anything.  Lastly, I'm a bit disappointed that there are no special features of any kind.  None.

So, do I recommend this DVD set?  Well, if the premise I described earlier sounds interesting to you and you can withstand some silliness, then give it a try.  If it doesn't, then obviously give it a pass.  Also, if you liked this show and are looking for something similar to check out, try watching ""Alien Planet"".",1350691200,2,2159,4.724598930481283
1958923,5,B0000YEDYU,"An interesting exercise in Evolutionary Imagination and Prognostication, my only complaint with ""The Future is Wild"" is that there wasn't more of it, such as a larger selection of ""Future"" Flora and Fauna.

1958925,5,B0000YEDYU,"Title of the review pretty much says it all. The CG still holds up pretty well, even after 5+ years. There aren't many speculative documentaries on how life might evolve in the future; thankfully, this is a great one.",1325721600,,217,4.589743589743589
1958926,5,B0000YEDYU,This movie consisted of 3 DVDs. I ordered it for a friend. I was impressed with the movie. I thought it was going to be one of those boring movies that you fall asleep on. But it basically tells you about what the world will look like in millions of years after humans have moved elsewhere off planet Earth. Very interesting to watch!,1280361600,,334,4.317460317460317
1958927,4,B0000YEDYU,"I wondered about all the reviews complaining about the pompous pretentious scientists.

HAHAHAHAHAHA! This thing has the funniest collection of nerdy scientists EVER. It's like they've gone out of their way to find the most stereotypical ivory tower twits in the scientific community. I began to wonder if they were real or actors costumed by a really good designer. I mean the rumpled coats and bow ties with funky awful hair and glasses abound to the point of absurdity! TOO FUNNY!

Still, what they are there for and telling us is how they came up with the wild future animals based on what has evolved in the past and it all has a logic to it.

But don't get your panties in a twist. It's all just speculation informed a bit by what we know. Don't get too serious This is supposed to be FUN.

And it is.

It's a great ride. Punctuated by the funniest scientists ever to evolve. So tie that bow tie, get a pocket protector, pop some corn, sit back and just go with the flow. It's great fun. Enjoy!

I give it 4 stars because I'm not too fond of the narrator's voice. But, for heaven's sake, don't let that stop you from watching.",1278633600,,1132,4.392344497607655
1958928,1,B0000YEDYU,"The single DVD version with the concept of the ""probes"" being sent from a future human race was a very upbeat and inovative plot device for this vision of Earth-after-man. That is what we all saw on the Animal Planet version of this show. Each of the ages was treated the same in the full length episodes as they were in the introductery condenced one hour form. They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away!
So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied. While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions. The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their ""new possibilities"". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations.
Obviously,I am in the minority here and I'm shouting ""FIRE"" long after the smoke has cooled. So be it. This is one of the very few times that the more intellectual cut was all wrong. The US versions were much better films in every way; repeat footage and all. You were viewing events,not ideas. It might have sold better too.",1270080000,5,1459,4.748031496062992
1958929,5,B0000YEDYU,I LOVE THIS SERIES! It gives a great view into what the future of the earth may actually be like and still leaves room for further possibilities.,1267315200,,145,4.407407407407407

1958941,4,B0000YEDYU,"To say that this is not really science is an understatement. When you get right down to it, it`s just speculation. But when dealing
with the question of what path future evolution might follow, the wild guess speculations found in this film are probably as
good of wild guesses as any are.
It`s not science or even what you could call a real documentary, but it is entertaining. And the critters discribed are by no
means impossible. There is plenty of food for thought here. The critters and their environments are well thought out and possible,
even if they are not probable.
Trying to predict the future path of evolution is very much like trying to predict next weeks lottery numbers. Your guess will likely
be wrong, but your guess is likely no worse than anyone else`s guess.",1264204800,,781,4.666666666666667
1958942,5,B0000YEDYU,"This is a wonderful series, but for those looking for the one that was on Discovery Kids, this is not it.

My son has watched the series with the kids, and is really enjoying this DVD set.  But sadly, the series with the kids exploring these future areas is not available to buy in any form.
And Discovery Kids is closing down at the end of 2009, to be replaced in late 2010 with a new channel, Hasbro Kids Channel.

I am hoping that The Future is Wild kid series will be also run on the Hasbro Kids Channel.  And will also be released on dvd, as the series wasn't run in order on Discovery Kids, so we have not had a chance to see 8 of the 26 episodes in the series.",1260316800,,667,3.992481203007519

1958944,1,B0000YEDYU,My son wanted this video so we got it.  There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL.  Maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is NOT real would be good.,1245974400,,183,3.918918918918919
1958945,4,B0000YEDYU,"I watched this program and wrote a review of its scientific principles for a college assignment.  Honestly, I'm surprised by how many reviews suggest that the creatures presented are too ""fantastic"" to have evolved from living forms in 200 million years.  If you've ever studied what earth looked like 200 million years -ago-, it really is not all that fantastic...in fact, I was surprised things didn't change -more-.

The scientific principles behind this are very sound.  The scientists creating this series looked at existing diversity of life forms and adaptations that exist today, and projected future continental drift and climate change to see what the world of 5, 100, or 200 million years from now would look like.  The phyla that inherit the future Earth are molluscs and arthropods, currently the most taxonomically dominant and diverse groups on the planet today.  They have very successful body forms, and it did not surprise me to see them largely take over the land from tetrapod forms in 200 million years.  Especially in the harsh conditions of a worldwide supercontinental desert after a mass extinction, it's no surprise that tetrapods don't last.  We and our four-legged kin aren't as well-suited to that sort of environment as other organisms are.

In addition, specific episodes focus on different evolutionary and ecological mechanisms.  ""Tropical Antarctica"" discusses evolutionary radiation and coevolution in an isolated environment.  ""Flooded World"" looks at symbiosis and mutualism.  ""Waterland"" examines parental care mechanisms, and each episode of the ""Ice World"" series at 5 million years from now looks at evolution of animals to adapt to a rapidly changing ice age climate.

The only thing I can really criticize is the CGI.  The effort in this series was obviously put into scientific accuracy rather than stunning visuals.  I've seen better CGI out of movies ten years older than this.  Something I found annoying, but actually slightly humorous was that they would use the same CGI multiple times to describe a single organism, but mirrored or with a different color filter, and apparently expected no one to notice.

Of course, the point of this series was not the CGI, it was the science, so it only loses one star for that.  That and the names of organisms are a bit fanciful, like deathgleaners and sharkopaths, but again, that's not the point of the series.  In addition, not all questions about specific organisms are explained, but I imagine that to be the nature of a 25-minute program rather than a flaw in the science.

Although we won't be able to start judging it as accurate or inaccurate for 5 million years (and I highly doubt humans will be around that long, honestly, at least not in our current form), it does present realistic and well-thought-out possibilities.  I think this program would be an excellent discussion-starter for a class on evolution, ecology, or organismal diversity.  I doubt that in 200 million years, we'll see the skies populated by ""flish"" as seen in the film.  At the very least they'll look a lot more realistic!  But it is certainly a possibility, and well-justified by scientific knowledge.  And that's the whole idea.",1243123200,,3203,5.078393881453155
1958946,5,B0000YEDYU,"I love this show.  It has great graphics and evidence enough to make you think, ""Hey, this might be possible.""  My only criticism is that they could have taken the show further.  In my opinion, the few hours given is not enough.",1232323200,,228,4.380952380952381
1958947,5,B0000YEDYU,My son and I had watched the Animal Planet show and he was immediately fascinated by the concept of hypothesizing based on evolutionary precepts.  He loves unusual animals of any kind and these definitely qualify.  He is constantly asking questions about the theories and postulating theories of his own based on the science in the show.  He loves it.,1230249600,,351,4.915254237288136
1958948,3,B0000YEDYU,"This DVD set is very entertaining-- funny, I should say.  The science is faulty, it's set on hypothesis only, rarely on scientific fact.  I am a college student and me and my friend found multiple errors in scientific facts.  The animals that evolved were too specialized in the present to have evolved so radically.  The names are uncreative but hilarious.

We did enjoy watching this, mostly for laughs and to feel intelligent.  The graphics are rather nice though, and I applaud the creators of this ""documentary"" for that.",1220745600,,526,4.920454545454546
1958949,5,B0000YEDYU,I bought this dvd for my son who has been wanting it since he saw it on TV. He loved it and has watched it many times since he got it.,1203638400,,134,3.3548387096774195
1958960,4,B0000YEDYU,"""The Future is Wild"" is an interesting take on the future of life on Earth at 5, 100, and 200 MY in the future. The CGI is pretty believable, and they back up their more unusual claims with modern-day examples. The names are a bit silly, but you can't really expect a proper Genus-species name for an imagined life-form!

Probably my greatest gripe about this is the 200 MY in the future segment.  The creators of this had a bit of a penchant for invetebrates, I think; the entire tetrapod line has gone extinct by this point (which I find difficult to believe given the length it's been around already and the huge degree of diversity found in it), which definitely provides the opportunity for huge adaptive radiation in the other genera -- but as I said, the premise is a bit difficult to swallow (a bit of tetrapod-centrism on my part? Maybe.).  Its also implied we (ie, tetrapods) got some stiff competition from invertebrates when oxygen levels rose.  However, given our generally more efficient oxygen processing it would seem that insectivorous birds and such would make the proverbial killing in this environment, but oh well.

If we accept that as a given, however, I definitely believe that cephalopods would be the next-in-line, so to speak.  And in any case, the series is entertaining to watch, and gives a good taste of evolution in action.",1201651200,,1355,4.74468085106383
1958961,3,B0000YEDYU,"This was a rather entertaining look at the way the world may change.  High on imagination and creativity, it still suffers from CGI that is not quite impressive.  The animals shown are fascinating and fairly well explored.  The video combined humor, action, and fantasy into an almost spellbinding show that kept my attention for the most part.  The constant attempts at explanation can be distracting and boring, however.  Overall, this is very much worth a look.  I would recommend renting before buying though.",1199836800,,513,5.120481927710843
1958962,4,B0000YEDYU,"Speculations can be neither right or wrong,but they can be interesting. Watching this program is much easier if you've read a lot of comic books or science fiction. I believe there were some minor flaws in the walking with dinosaurs series,but the most I can say about this series is how far-fetched a couple of the animals are.
  It's never explained to my satifaction how a ""flish"" breaths air or water or how it reproduces. The idea of squids becoming monkeys and predatory elephants is ridiculous. Why would a shark bother developing a flashy system of communication when most sharks are solitary...and have looked much the same for millions of years?
  Still,some animals aren't that far-fetched. There are spiders today that live in colonies with a ""queen"".There are ants that squirt acid. There are birds that burrow in the dirt. Some rodents do get big;the capibarra for instance. There were pre-historic predatory birds that stood about six feet tall. There's even talk of a veleciorapter-relative fossil that had 4 wings. So most of the animals aren't all that much of a stretch to the imagination.
  CREATIONISTS:The theory of evolution is never called into question. In fact, with the exception of the squids, all of the animals in TFIW can be cataloged today,either in the fossil record or modern day counterparts. Just makes me wonder what they were smoking when they thought up the squid-monkeys. Some of it has to taken with a grain of salt.
  As far as man's absense,well...it would be the height of egotism to assume that we will be the last animal alive on earth. When watched with an open mind,...and perhaps a sense of humor,this a very enjoyable program.",1189468800,,1676,4.897526501766785
1958963,5,B0000YEDYU,"""The Future is Wild"" is based on scientific assumptions as to what will live on Earth in millions of years from now. This series is not as far-fetched as it seems. Scientists comment through the whole series and explain how and why these animals might evolve. Some of the theories seem insane like their idea that squid will take the place of humans as the dominant species on the planet, but the way the scientists explain these possibilities, the idea becomes understandable, and even possilble. ""The Future is Wild"" is a great series, but if you have a short attention span, I wouldn't watch it. I hope this review was helpful and I hope you enjoy ""The Future is Wild""!

1958965,3,B0000YEDYU,"I think I saw this once, without the scientific commentary, and it was fantastic.  I don't believe, as one reviewer said here, that you have to be more than an ""average joe"" to understand the commentaries by illustrious teachers, because what they're saying isn't that complex, and it's explained by well-drawn digital diagrams, etc.  In fact, the digital stuff is exquisite.  It's just too bad there's not more of it, and I think in the original I saw I loved it because it just went from one digital image to another, and the artistry was marvelous.  Frankly, I was shocked at how boring the scientific commentary was.  At the risk of sounding anti-intellectual (which I am not - I'm a writer and teacher myself) I have to wonder why these incredibly frumpy, lumpy, dumpy scientists were allowed to appear as themselves on what was otherwise a slick and attractive presentation (although there was nowhere near as much variety as there could have been - the repetitiveness of the imagery in this version nearly drove me mad).  What I'm saying is that if you are going to create a commercial film for mass consumption, at least make sure that your stars trim their hair, wear well-fitting clothing that at least camouflages a paunch, and get rid of of the absurd accessories, i.e., floppy, printed day-glow bow-ties and matching pocket handkerchiefs. The public is used to well-groomed celebrities and presenters, but that's not what I am talking about.  It's nice to see ""real"" people in commercial productions.  However - even ""real"" people can present a semblance of taste, when appearing before the public.  The only thing that redeems these geeks is the fact that they resemble, somewhat, the creatures they are describing, especially the giant squid at the end with eight klutzy legs and the pulsing blue light on its forehead: a very attractive millipod or whatever the freak it was.  Enough.  I just threw the freaking thing against the wall in frustration.  I suppose I'll have to write again and make amends for my rude commentary.  But really - is this thing actually a comedy?  By the end of it my husband I were writhing on the floor in hysterical laughter.  Jim Carey should do a take-off.  Love you, guys; geniuses.  You made me laff.",1170806400,4,2250,4.817708333333333
1958966,5,B0000YEDYU,"Realize that no one said this is ""real"". It's a movie about the FUTURE people.

That being said, I teach high school biology and environmental science and I find this to be an excellent and entertaining DVD series. I use it to reinforce principles like: Plate tectonics, Climate patterns, Adaptation, Desert formation, Biomes, Eusocial insect societies, and especially, Evolution. I could go on and on with the concepts that are applicable to this series. I have been using this series for 3 years now and I have yet to have a student complain about the series being boring or too ""fake"". I have had MANY students ask if this is real, to which I have to remind students that it is set in the future and therefore the animals can't be real but the concepts are real.

Why is this applicable to teachers? The DVDs introduce fictional creaures, many of which are absolutely fantastic, and then procede to explain how the amazing things they have come up with are already around on Earth right now, just in different forms. So the series really is about present animals as much as future animals.

I use it in high school, but it is just as useful for middle school. Please, if you are a science teacher, you owe it to yourself to see these DVDs. When you see how good a teaching tool they can be, you'll want to purchase these (or get your school media center to purchase them!).",1169164800,12,1376,4.540322580645161

1958970,4,B0000YEDYU,"I did not have high hopes for this series. I assumed it would be rather silly and was looking to be entertained by the strange and the bizarre. I did find those aspects but I found more as well.

These programs look at the possible evolution of life in the future without humans and in radically different environments. These speculative life forms are interesting but I expected nothing beyond wild, ""artists' conceptions"". The results are wild but they are based on informed speculation. However bizarre the hypothetical creature presented is, it is compared to current fauna with similar or analogous features. Those features are just taken further and the results are interesting to watch.

This program could be looked upon as a way to teach the fundamental ideas of natural selection in a new and different manner; looking to the future instead of the past.

Episode synopses appear below:

Disc One: 5 Million Years - Ice Age World

Welcome to the Future - This first episode sets out the suppositions. It postulates a world without humans in which natural selection has had free reign to produce bizarre new life forms. Three time periods are posited. The first is about 5 million years from now. The earth is in the grip of a terrible ice age and the life forms are adapted accordingly. The next scenario takes the opposite extreme. It takes place 100 million years in the future and is a hothouse world. To change things even more dramatically, the third epoch conceived is 200 million years in the future and takes place after a mass extinction event in which most species are killed and the few survivors adapt and radiate into the strangest life forms of all. Each period provides brief glances at some to the imaginary life forms of the future but none is examined in any real depth. This episode serves to set the stage for what is to come by giving the background.

Return of the Ice - This episode concentrate on an arctic environment about 5 million years in the future. Some of the life forms presented include a large rodent which travels in herds, a bird evolved to take the place of toothed whales and a large carnivore that preys on both of them.

The Vanished Sea - Taking place in the same ice age of the previous episode, this episode examines a completely different environment. The locus is the Mediterranean Sea with a big difference from the present day. It is all dried up and is now a salt desert supporting only specifically adapted animals. The ones examined closely in this episode are a large frilled lizard living on the salt flats, a descendant of the martin which is now a major predator and a highly evolved pig.

The Prairies of Amazonia - In this episode we visit yet another biome of the ice age of the future. This one is the vast grassland that occupies most of the continent of South America. It has replaced the Amazon and there are some new and different creatures but, by and large, these creatures face the same challenges that confront today's inhabitants of savannahs. We are introduced to a tool making monkey that bears some resemblance to a baboon, a large flightless bird which has become a top predator and a large rodent which has evolved defensive armor.

Cold Kansas Desert - The climate this time is the great desert of the North American Midwest. This desert, though, is frigid owing to the great ice fields. Here, we encounter a large rodent related to the ones of the grasslands of the previous episode. They feed on the same tubers as a small, burrowing descendant of the quail; one with a hive oriented social structure. These flightless birds are the principal prey of gigantic, carnivorous bats which roam the skies looking for easy pickings; they are the evolutionary successors to the buzzards.

Disc Two: 100 Million Years - Hothouse World

Waterland - An additional 95 million years has passed since the time of the previous disk and the world has changed a lot. It is a very hot and very moist world and life has had to adapt. This first episode takes place in a swamp environment. Huge descendants of turtles, the largest land animal ever to walk the earth, stalk the swamps looking for vegetation to eat. Trying to keep out of the way are terrestrial (amphibious) octopi. These mollusks have colonized the land seeking safety from large, predatory fish which use electricity on a scale not envisioned by our modern eels.

Flooded World - I like coelenterates as much as the next guy but this episode didn't do much for me. It focuses on the shallow seas of the hothouse earth. The major critters are a huge jellyfish that actually consists of a variety of creatures working together for the common good, a sea slug that has become as mobile as your average fish and a sea spider that exists to protect the big jellyfish.

Tropical Antarctica - Antarctica has migrated from its position over the southern pole and has become a lush, tropical jungle. Many of the depicted life forms are evolved from petrels. Some take the role of a hummingbird and another has evolved a noxious chemical weapon system. Very large insects are a major predator but smaller insects get their licks in as well. This was a pretty good episode.

The Great Plateau - This episode takes place on a mountain plateau that makes the Himalayas look like minor foothills. Its inhabitants include giant, blue birds with four wings, large spiders that build webs across canyons and which farm mammals and these curious mammals which are the last ones left on earth. It's another really good episode.

Disc Three: 200 Million Years - New World

The Endless Desert - It's a new world. Vulcanism and an asteroid strike have changed the planet immensely. The continents coming together to form a super-continent has also had an effect. Most of the earth is a vast desert. The wiping out of most species has provided new opportunities for a few. A termite has evolved to be adapted to hunting, agriculture and mining. Worms have it good as well and demonstrate both agrarian and hunting varieties.

The Global Ocean - One continent means that there is once ocean as well and this ocean has seen some major changes. Fish are virtually gone. Their multitudinous places in the ecosystems have been taken over by arthropods. Fish are not completely gone, however. Some have become real flying creatures that can breath air. Cephalopods are around as well and they have evolved. Their intelligence is greater and their camouflage is more effective. They can also get huge. Some things remain the same, however. Sharks are still efficient killers; they have just further refined their methods.

Graveyard Desert - More troubles in the desert are the theme of this one as we learn about scavenging beetles, scavenging worms, hopping snails and some carnivorous plants that feed on larger life forms than small bugs. This has been the only episode thus far where a plant is a significant part of the show.

The Tentacled Forest - Although most of the land is a great desert, there is a magnificent rainforest along the coast. In this environment there are more fish turned to land dwelling flying creatures, giant lichens which resemble trees, slime molds that hunt and a gigantic, walking terrestrial squid. To top things off, there is another squid which dwells in the trees and swings around like an ape. These are intelligent squids and the possibility is left open that they will further involve and become...civilized.",1140912000,53,7453,4.777000777000777
1958971,5,B0000YEDYU,"It's funny, our time on this planet is so short (70-80 years) that it can be hard to predict even what the next century would be like. The last century was full of many fanciful predictions (where's my flying car???). In fact, after watching this series, I realized how even ~15,000 years for human civilization seems like a drop in the bucket compared to how millions, billions of years old this planet is.

Each disc features a different point in the future - 5 million years, 100 million years, 200 million years. Those millions of years is a long time for creatures to change and evolve. The new animals (which seem a little like they came out of ""Impossible Creatures"" are all based on a present-day animal. The creatures are all given some rather silly names as well, such as a poggle (the last mammal), the swampas (land squid) and squibbons (tree-dwelling squid). Basically I remember them as dinural bats, underground quail, large spiders, rattle rodents, giant tortoises, and killer prairie birds.

The CGI used for the animals isn't so great compared to other examples and by showing animals in danger or being killed, the program tried to be like a traditional nature show. But the CGI was decent enough to give people an idea. The predictive evolution was complimented by nature footage that demonstrate animal behaviour and how the future animals might use or develop these traits in the future. I thought the predictions were very creative though and it was enjoyable to watch.

No predictions are given for the future race, and it is assumed that nature has ""taken it back"". I think it would have been too hard or controversial for the producers to feature humans.",1137024000,,1680,4.806228373702422
1958972,3,B0000YEDYU,"As a tremendous fan of Dougal Dixon's ""After Man"", I was shocked to find out recently that ""The Future Is Wild"" had slipped under my radar. I now have both the TV series and the book derived from it. Surprisingly enough, I would recommend buying the book and skipping this DVD set.

Why? It would be easy to get down on the CG animation, which is mostly neither more nor less than mediocre. However, it really isn't too broken, and there are a few genuinely impressive shots scattered about. The main problem with this series comes from outside the CG department: When the program shows you the *same* 10 seconds of animation ten or more times (I am not making this up) in ten or twenty minutes, it becomes very difficult to keep a straight face. Sometimes the footage is tinted or *reversed right-to-left* in a feeble attempt at disguise, but most of the time it is simply one of three or four shots per species, played over and over and over again under different circumstances. The narration is also almost entirely narrative in nature - seldom explanatory - and riddled with awkward pauses, forced drama, and endless repetition.

Even given the limited amount of animation available, the show didn't have to be this way; much more sparing use could have been made of the animation by expanding the scientists' filmed explanations, as well as the excellent real-world footage which is used to explain the climatic changes and modern-day basis for their speculations. As it is, the series winds up as a shapeless, shallow circus leaning far too heavily on a sideshow.",1132358400,7,1569,4.764705882352941
1958973,4,B0000YEDYU,"My 6 year old wanted this series so I ordered it.  We don't have cable so when we saw a little piece of this series at a pizza place, we thought, hey...looks interesting.

My son enjoyed it and I did as well.  I wouldn't have purchased this if I had seen it on cable, but my son has had fun sharing with others what the future may hold.

It did fire up a discussion about traveling through time both past and future and my son has decided he will invent that machine just to really see what's up with the future.  So from that standpoint it was fun and helped stir up quite a fun discussion and spark a 6 year old boy's imagine to go wild.

1958986,4,B0000YEDYU,"I saw this on digital cable and found it to be wonderfully creative and well thought out. The Animation wasn't the best of the ""Walking-With"" Genre, but I still found it interesting.

Behavioral and physical aspects of these supposed creatures of the future are interesting and, as I mentioned earlier, well thought out.

My only gripe with this movie is that it is assumed that the climate gets too harsh for people in 5 million years, we leave, and that's where this starts. Now, be real. If humans haven't completely ravaged or destroyed the planet in 5 million years, we will be plenty advanced enough to survive a second ice age. If we could survive a first with stone working, animal furs and basic metallurgey, I think we could handle a second one 5 mllion years from now.

Most of it is very interesting and while the DVDs have no extras, the episodes do, in the form of scientists explaining in detail what examples of animals in the past or in the present allowed them to design such wonderful new future creatures.  They also talk about social behavior, changes to the climate and to the Earth's land mass itself.
Sometimes the CG looks a tad fake, but kiddies should enjoy it.  Be warned, like many nature shows there are predators killing prey or animals 'failing' to survive.",1082678400,43,838,4.529801324503311

and stranger new life forms have emerged. Such as giant landwalking squids, monolithic turtles, and carnivorous fish that literally electrifies their prey. And many strange vistas.

8004508,3,B0000YEDYU,"The Future is Wild is a 13-part BBC documentary based on the same concept as Dougal Dixon's classical book After Man: A Zoology of the Future. A number of scientists have speculated about the future course of evolution, and come up with more or less believable scenarios about animal life 5, 100 and 200 million years ahead. Just like in Dixon's book, humanity has gone extinct. Apparently, there is a less pessimistic American version of the series, where humanity has left Earth for greener cosmic pastures and sends back probes to scan the old planet's development! Although The Future is Wild is somewhat dragging, I admit that I like the concept.

The fantasy animals featured are relatively believable, obviously because they are freely based on real creatures, alive today or in the Earth's past. 5 million years into the future, the world is in the grip of a new Ice Age, a perfectly realistic scenario. The Mediterranean has tried up and been turned into a gigantic salt desert. Most animals still resemble the forms we have today. 100 million years into the future, the world is going through a hotter and more humid period, during which Antarctica will be covered by rain forests. Mammals for some reason go extinct, being replaced by giant spiders, dinosaur-like tortoises or land-dwelling octopi.

The most speculative part deals with the world 200 million years ahead. A massive geological cataclysm have wiped out most life on Earth, the climate is forbidding, and only lower life forms are left to repopulate the small ecological niches left, something they do with a gusto. Lichens evolve into trees, fish take to the air, and a gigantic squid the size and shape of an elephant roams the only forest left on a supercontinent of desolation

Some people might perhaps find the philosophy behind The Future is Wild objectionable. How can scientists claim to predict the future paths of evolution? Simple answer: they can't and they don't. The documentary is really a roundabout way to teach the viewer the basics of the evolutionary worldview as such. Another objection: why must humanity go extinct? Why can't our creative intelligence save us? Personally, I happen to think that intelligence is the goal of evolution, but that doesn't mean there are any guarantees that our particular civilization (or species) is going to make it. If we screw up, the future will indeed be wild, until some other lineage develops enough intelligence not to squander the planet's non-renewable resources in less than 200 years",1430006400,,2525,5.007142857142857
