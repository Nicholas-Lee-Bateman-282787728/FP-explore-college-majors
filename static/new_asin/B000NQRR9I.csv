8180885,4,B000NQRR9I,"Ebony (Sakeena Nicole) is trying to move on w/ her life, after a horrible ordeal at the hands of her ex-boyfriend. She's attempting to be a professional singer, and her best friend Cedric works in a music studio. All is well, until Ebony's friends begin dying in brutal, bloody ways!  Has her insane ex returned to exact his twisted vengeance? Has his involvement in the occult turned him into some sort of satanic stalker? BLEEDING ROSE is an extremely low budget film. Even so, it manages to make the best of its obviously limited resources. The filmmakers overcome the usual ""home movie"" look of most such films by using non-static camera work, and by having a halfway decent story. As YORK productions go, this is the best I've seen. Worth checking out...",1384992000,,759,4.75
8180886,1,B000NQRR9I,"Why is it I can't watch a movie now days about a black man & woman recording music without whitey messing it all up? Seriously yo, Ebony Flowers was like tight and that Cedric was a dawg yo until Lonnie Caucasian shows up and ruins it all. Now I know not all white folk worship Satan, but most of them do and that's what makes this a bad film. As matter of fact I haven't even finished the movie yet and I already know what's gonna happen... Look! Brother has a bee hive on his head! And what's up with Ebony's foot? It's like a frostbitten Sasquatch foot. This movie would have been given a better rating if wasn't for all them crackers summoning demons and such. Does Amazon sell Sasquatch foots?

I was right! In comes ole pasty face with a pentagon painted in on his head. Nasty!",1348617600,,783,4.25503355704698
8180887,2,B000NQRR9I,"See what happens when you move back home? 30-something Ebony (Sakeena Nicole) has been away from Brooklyn for a while, but when she moves back after a disastrous relationship, back to live with her father, she thinks her life is turning around. Little does she know things are only going to get worse.

Things look okay for Ebony at first. She's reconnecting with old friends Candace and Cedric (Archie Ekong). Cedric's working with a writer/producer friend and they've enlisted Ebony as one of their stable of singers. Cedric says he sees Ebony as a little sister, but his flirting says otherwise. Ebony is meanwhile still pining over Alex, the abusive boyfriend she just left. Alex keeps appearing to Ebony in her dreams and she always wakes up from them screaming, but she still can't help loving that man of hers.

And that's when the bodies start to pile up. First there's Candace, then Cedric's girlfriend Dee. Fingerprints and DNA point to Cedric's partner Kyle who has slowly been moving in on Ebony, but why would he kill Dee?

Later that night, Kyle escapes jail and shows up back at Ebony's house where Cedric has been hanging out and drinking. He's beaten and bloody, but before they can find out what's what, the police show up. Unfortunately they didn't show up in time to keep Kyle from killing Ebony's father.

The police move Cedric and Ebony to a motel where they start to reveal their true feelings for each other, but just as things start to look up again, Cedric starts acting a little weird.

Crap, I think I forgot to mention Ebony left her abusive boyfriend Alex not because he was abusive but because he was practicing black magic. But wait, what's this? The police, in compiling their list of friends and relatives of Ebony and Cedric in order to keep everyone safe discover Alex is dead as well, the apparent first victim of the Ebony/Cedric-Friends and Family Killer. I think we can see where this is all going.

Let's cut to the chase and get it over with: this movie was crap. I could handle the poor quality digital video. I could made do with the drama club acting (does it really need to be mentioned that none of the main cast were in anything before or after this movie?) and the 8th grade dialogue. What I couldn't take were the unending scenes of nothing. This is a slasher flick, I do not need expository scenes of Cedric and Kyle playing handball while they discuss their feelings. I don't need Ebony and Candace painting each other's toenails and talking about how good it is that Ebony's back. Let me see the bodies and please God try to put some mystery around the killer's identity--another area where this movie failed HUGE. It's obvious the REAL killer is Alex from the get-go, and once Ebony mentions he was into black magic, well, it doesn't take Denzel Washington to figure out what's going on.

BLEEDING ROSE is writer/director/cinematographer/producer/editor Kareem Bland's only movie. And that is proof Todd Sheets is alive and that he loves us. The fact Bland hasn't bothered to commit anything else to film since this movie was released in 2007 is a good thing for all involved.

Now, don't get me wrong. BLEEDING ROSE isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact, Bland and company give it the old college try and whatnot, but, hey, his last name ain't ""Bland"" for nothing. To me it's the intention behind the finished product that I see that makes it so hard to get on board with this movie. With a lot of crappy movies I've seen it's obvious the ones in charge aren't even trying, they're just filming their script and hoping to have something that doesn't embarrass their family in the end. But Bland really wants this to be a good movie. The script is full of heavy dialogue and the tone suggests something more along the lines of a mainstream relationship movie, NOT a slasher flick. But the killer aspects of the movie are woven so well into the fabric of the relationship story that it all melds perfectly. But it's just so boring.

BLEEDING ROSE has all the signs of taking inspiration from a dozen different and better-executed movies and trying to make them all work within one framework. And I can't help think that, given a better script, better actors and a better director, someone could have made something pretty good out of BLEEDING ROSE.

Too bad that wasn't the version I saw. So it goes.",1342483200,,4362,4.653246753246753
8180888,5,B000NQRR9I,"This is one of those movies when after you finish watching it you say: ""Damn, what a great and clever story, I only wish they had a bigger budget!""

Bleeding Rose is Inventive.  Stylish.  Scary.  And loaded with twists and turns that'll have you guessing to the very end.  A very fun ride with a great meaningful story...something you don't see in movies these days.  For a ""true"" independent movie, Bleeding Rose is great!  It's worth a look.

The DVD includes ""guerrilla-style"" filmmaking behind the scenes footage, a cool music video, deleted scenes and a trailer.  Making it a great buy as well.  So get it.  And support true independent filmmaking.  You won't be disappointed.

There's also a Motion Picture Soundtrack available.  Bleeding Rose: The Album.  Look for it.  It's scary good.",1180137600,2,793,4.893939393939394
