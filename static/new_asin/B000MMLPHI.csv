8170097,4,B000MMLPHI,"D'eon is learning more about his sister as each day passes.

  Continuing to search for the murderers of his sister, D'eon is learning about the evils around the king's court such as  dark sorcerers, manipulative royals and monsters are around him.

  Fortunately, he has the help of Robin, Durand and Teillagory to assist him in his search.

  The second volume of ""Le Chevalier D'Eon"" features episodes 5-8.
  Episode 5 (Palais Royal) features a date between D'Eon and Anna and Voronzoff escaping to Russia.

  Episode 6 (Knights of the King) features  a new task given to Eon and his friends to go to Russia and pursue the King's Psalm and to look for Voronzof.

  What is interesting in this episode is that D'Eon, working with the Queen have managed to find a way to bring Lia into the world and in order this to happen, D'Eon must wear his sister's clothing and think that he is her.

  By doing this, the Queen is able to communicate with Lia and tries to find out who the traitor is.

  In episode 7 (Gargoyles), D'Eon, Durand, Teillagory and Robin leave to go to Russia for their mission.

  Introduced is a new character named Lorenzia who has a way of summoning evil dogs and has them attacking D'eon and friends.  Which leads to the first confrontation between Lia and Lorenzia.

  In episode 8 (Audience with the Empress), D'Eon and friends reach Russia.
  We are introduced to the empress and although it may seem she is a person of power, the men of Russia treat women pretty low and are trying to unseat her.

  But fortunately, D'Eon and Robin meet the empress and may be what is needed to help her.

  As for the DVD, special features include Historical Notes, Cast Photo Portfolio, Conversations with Knights: Commentary with the Swordsmen of Le Chevalier, The Royal Mystique: Commentary with the Royal Women of Le Chevalier, Japanese promo event (17 minutes) and clean opening and closing animations.

  As for the included 20-page booklet, character information on Robin, Durand and Teillagory.  Also, included is an interview with series creator Ubukata Tow who actually talks about how ""Le Chevalier D'Eon"" were created differently for the novel, manga and anime series.  The remaining pages feature a script serialization of ""Chevalier -Held in the Heart II"".

  To describe volume 2, I will say that the four episodes feature less action, more of a focus on character development and even more character introductions.

  Some may find the pacing slow (especially if they are expecting more action and fight scenes) and that there may be too many characters being introduced in for this anime series but I have faith that the creator has all these characters for a reason.

  So, Vol. 2 features a few political situations such as women's issues in Russia and a cultural practice of that time,  men dressing like women.

  Volume 2 is slower-paced but I'm sure it's setting the viewer up for bigger things to come.",1218326400,,2939,4.798792756539235
