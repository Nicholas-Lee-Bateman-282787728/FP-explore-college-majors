8499980,5,B002L6CG8A,"This DVD contains 14 chants with actions and a cheer.  It is great for beginning a cheerleading squad.  They show each chant/cheer three times, and the actions are easy to follow.  However, they do not explain how to do each movement.  You just have to watch and follow along.  Lots of positive cheers shown in a short amount of time.  Worth your money if you are trying to build a repitore of cheers and chants.",1337644800,,412,4.426666666666667
