2533589,4,B000ESSSZ2,"The Amazing Kreskin is nothing short of amazing, and there's nothing wrong with the fact that he knows it! These somewhat dated shows from the early 70s will make those who recall watching the shows at the time feel old, and just how much they've been through, especially when he references movies like STAR WARS.

Ouch.

Yes, Kreskin even amazes himself at times and mum's the word when it comes to how he does it. Some of it has to be legitimate ESP, but other parts are simply sleight of hand and magic tricks. His relentless use of cards becomes tiring (it's something many magicians become competent in), but when he rattles off birthdays, parts of peoples' Social Security numbers and the like; when he tells people how many kids they have, what their ages are and their birth dates are; and when he tells them what types of pets they have -- these things are much harder to do unless you have some part of your mind you can tap into. And Kreskin can reach that part of his mind.

He claims to do nothing that anyone else can't do, but he's clearly wrong. His ability to hypnotize is astounding. Hypnotism is no easy thing to master, and yet he's a master of it, and he shouldn't underestimate his abilities.

The movie THE GREAT BUCK HENRY is based on Kreskin, but unlike the character in the movie, Kreskin is a gentleman and has a great and abiding regard for people. It's important to him that they believe in him, even though some parts are more trick than treat. In the end, he could be everyone's favorite uncle. I'm often astounded at the meanness people show in regard to the man, but he will undoubtedly be vastly underestimated by people when he passes from the public scene. In reality, he will be one of the giants on whose shoulders others will stand. I know people who know his name, but have never seen him. That's sad. This collection is well worth having, especially for fans.",1254182400,6,1900,4.498550724637681
2533590,5,B000ESSSZ2,"Accused of swiping from another classic, Kreskin was and remains his own weird personality. Blurring the lines between various forms of entertainment, this is the guy of whom has been said ""he has no 'off' switch!"" Once you see him (especially in person) you'll never forget him. The current movie (""the Amazing Buck Howard"") is partly based on him - but the real Kreskin is even stranger, even more amazing than anything that's been put on the screen.",1237680000,3,452,4.8076923076923075
2533591,5,B000ESSSZ2,"I will be brief- if you are a mentalist or love to watch mentalism, JUST GET IT. You won't be dissapointed. Kreskin is truly Amazing. Even if they are old, he used all forms of mental suggestions that are talked about today- suggestions using sleight of mouth, educated guesses, sleight of hand, and some ESP. He is respectable, and someone worth watching in action. I wish, he passes his knowledge to someone.",1223769600,11,410,4.708333333333333
2533592,5,B000ESSSZ2,"I may be wrong--I tend to think the things Kreskin had done were faked, but who cares. I mean the guy does a lot of CARD tricks. But it was wonderful to see his program. This is a beautiful set--a solid box that houses three DVDs, and a cool pendulmn, which is pretty enough to wear as a piece of jewelry.

The first show was guest SYBIL LEEK!!! What a rare treat.  I'm a big fan of Sybil Leek as she was a marvelous highly imaginative writer, who died in 1983, but I never seen her on television. I got to see her interviewed. I was delighted. It was worth it just to see that one interview.

IF YOU CAN FIND THIS DVD COLLECTION, TRUST ME IT IS WORTH GETTING!!!",1200700800,3,662,4.076923076923077

8114090,5,B000ESSSZ2,"This is an outstanding collection of Kreskin's original television show ""back when..."" and it is a classic keeper! The ESP game included was an extra ""amazing"" treat. Any Kreskin fans should own this set while they can still find it. He is the original mentalist of our time and still the best.",1434844800,,294,4.673076923076923
8114091,5,B000ESSSZ2,"The Amazing Kreskin ""The World's Foremost Mentalist"" displays the mindreading skills that won him many fans over his long career on this DVD set. He also is a really good interviewer getting guests to open up and talk about subjects that they don't normally discuss in interviews.

8114094,5,B000ESSSZ2,"Kreskin has had a movie the Great Buck Howard made about him, performed on the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson more times than any other act, and this collection is really wonderful and amazing. In today's world of heavy video editing and camera tricks featured in most magic shows on TV, Kreskin's TV show and performances stand out as a master of the art performing with no net on a live on tape show. If you want to see how magic and mentalism should be done buy this and spend some time watching a master of the art.",1391385600,,524,4.357142857142857
