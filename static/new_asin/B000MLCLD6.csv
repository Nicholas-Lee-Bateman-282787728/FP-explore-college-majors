8169729,5,B000MLCLD6,"I remember as a kid some of my friends and I would go to the video store together with our parents.  My friends and I would always head strait toward the Horror section and gaze at the rows and rows of vhs boxes displaying all the wonderful, yet scary, art work.  Maybe it was just me out of the bunch who did that haha.  I remember seeing the vhs box of
'Inhumanities: Modern Atrocities' -part 2 along with some of those 'Faces of Death' videos also.  As a kid, those flicks were so taboo and was very much talked about with my childhood friends at that time.  We would lie to each other and say we seen them and from there, make up our own stories when we spent the night at each others house haha.

 My Dad would just about let me watch any horror flick but those.  He knew it was driving my curiosity wild.  He knew best though.  When I was around fourteen or maybe it was fifteen, after a long talk with me about what I was going to experience, my Dad said ok and took me to the video store.  We went strait to the Horror section and grabbed 'Faces of Death'  and 'Inhumanities' part 2.  He had to check them out for me of course haha.  Later that evening we got back to the house and he said, ""take them and watch them in your room...if it gets to be too much, turn it off.""  I watched both and I remember 'Inhumanities 2' really getting to me just as equally as F.O.D. did.  I think all this curiosity about death at a young age was driving me nuts because I had witnessed a man being struck by a train a couple of summers ago.  Well, I've seen them all now and I'm glad I did, simply because I know longer have to be curious and have the urge to want to watch these flicks again.  The only time I would watch something like this again, is if I'm with company who want to view it for the first time.  There's one scene in 'Inhumanities 2' that is really chilling!  This scene captures a sky diver's camcorder.  It shows you what he sees!  He jumps out of the plane and seconds later, realizes his parachute will not work!!!!  Truly chilling indeed!",1259884800,2,2055,4.133838383838384
