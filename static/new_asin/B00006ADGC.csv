7966021,2,B00006ADGC,"Five stars for Doughty! I watched the VT because I like the female actresses so much, but the plot cut women short.

I was very impressed with the sensitivity and believability portrayed by Kenny Doughty.  He played his part perfectly in an understated way, which made the flick a somewhat painful joke on women, despite 3 major lead female actresses through whom the film intended to show female solidarity.",1323907200,,408,4.898550724637682
7966022,5,B00006ADGC,"I loved this movie, being an incurable romantic, and loving Andie MacDowell and England.  I am unable to find the soundtrack to this movie.  The music was beautiful, and one of the songs was called ""Angel"" but the print was so tiny on the TV that I couldn't read the artist's name.  Does anyone know how to find out about how to locate the soundtrack, or if not that, then that particular song?  Any help would be appreciated.  Too many times, I have found movies with great soundtracks, but the credits come at the end, and they are in teeny tiny print so are, therefore, illegible.  Got any tips?",1141862400,,598,4.440366972477064
7966023,5,B00006ADGC,This is a great movie.  I love it. It is just a perfect chick flick.  It gives you funny and sad in the same two hours.,1104796800,,119,3.5384615384615383
7966024,5,B00006ADGC,"I rented this movie the other night as I could see nothing else that looked half-decent and I was shocked at how good it was.  Being from FilmFour(film arm of a British Tv Channel)  I wasn't expecting much, but it was incredible.  If you liked Bridget Jones you will love this movie.  FANTASTIC",1043798400,,294,4.490566037735849
7966025,5,B00006ADGC,Whew. I laughed my butt off until Kate's friends plotted to destroy her relationship. After the fallout from that I cried and cried. The love between Kate and Jed was so pure-so real. Incredibly acted and writtten. It really felt like someone had really died. I was incredulous at Kate for forgiving her friends. Didn't seem that it should've ended that way. So all in all-a crazy mix. Very funny and very heartbreaking.,1039219200,,420,4.767123287671233
