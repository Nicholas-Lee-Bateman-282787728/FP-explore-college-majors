Worse than the worst vhs tape you could imagine. Color completely washed out, no sharpness to the picture, and terrible sound. Please somebody put a legit version of this out on blue ray/DVD.",1502409600,,369,4.590909090909091

7908487,5,B00000FZ7T,"I own ""Mako-Jaws of Death"" co. 1976, and I remember the film when it came out. I loved the spiritual side of this remarkably done film as it struck hard very precise chords of my own inner realm regarding my relationship with sharks; especially the Great White. I not only enjoyed the story formatting, the characters, but the manner in which it was done all in all. I also loved, in most particular, the scene poised in flashback, which makes the present better understood; how the man received his shark tooth medallion in the Philippines in Mindanao, or the ""wild, wild south."" I loved the scene when the man accidentally fell across the elderly Nganasan shaman, who was real by the way, and was 60 when in this movie, and died in 1980 at the age of 64, but it was the wooden shark shrine, surprisingly like one I MYSELF had made, because I have long worshiped the Great White nearly lifelong. I loved how it was made, and of course, this special scene in the mid 1970's, the low technical ways and methods, as said, no cages or protective equipment to keep the actors safe, etc. The beauty of the simpler time we of the 1970's fondly recall, and the 5 mm film, although often grainy back then, made it all the more wonderful, which well includes the extremity of the wildlife back then, in Florida Keys, which was a place I too was famiiluar with in that same euphoric time I lovingly recall as I emphatically describe in nearly all of my books, whether they are fiction or nonfiction.

Of course I love sharks and I love movies so this is a no brainer - 5 stars!!!",1351296000,3,241,3.7450980392156863
7908489,5,B00000FZ7T,This movie is a classic and has a cult following I only hope that it will be released on DVD. Buffy D was great. I am still looking for other movies he is in. Any help out there?,1300579200,3,178,3.710526315789474
7908490,5,B00000FZ7T,"The copy I received in DVD form was perfect.  Many thanks for the memories - I wrote the screenplay under a nom de plume because the director couldn't read . . . I also wrote the concepts for Lucky Lady with Burt Reynolds and the TV series In Search Of . . . plus wrote and directed Bloodstalkers and ""starred"" in The Search for Bigfoot while appearing too in the Smithsonian Series ""Monsters Myth or Mystery""",1156377600,6,409,4.381578947368421
7908491,1,B00000FZ7T,"William Grefe: the name is synonymous with ""horribly made movies."" This little gem from 1976 cashes in on the ""Jaws"" craze with perhaps the most ridiculous concept in fish movies ever: a psychic hero who communes with the sharks telepathically (somehow via a necklace obtained on Mindanao during a ""shark god"" ceremony, in a subplot that involved much running through a jungle) and defends his toothy friends. Well, really not so toothy, actually. The movie uses Nurse Sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum); large, sluggish sharks, which although they do have teeth, are generally harmless unless provoked. You can spot the Nurse Sharks by looking for the wide head with pronounced barbels (thin, whisker-looking organs in front of the nostrils that are used for sensing touch and taste). End of ichthyology lesson.

Back to the film: this poorly made rip-off contains some of the worst acting and screenwriting in memory, another signature of a Grefe production. The hero (Richard Jaeckel) grimaces through the movie like Mod-Hair Ken in need of Imodium AD. He takes his fish extremely seriously, and becomes a one man shark-feeding machine, placing anyone who crosses his path into the gums of his nurse shark friends. The leading lady is Jennifer Bishop, who may be the worst actress I have ever seen, and wears more eye makeup than Tura Satana. Her aquatic dance scenes are so exciting I believe I may have dozed off during the bulk of them, except during her brief tango with Sam the shark. Her husband, only slightly more overweight than Mr. Creosote, and unfortunately spending much of the film in shorts, is the evil villain, and is very scary (if you happen to be scared of a 500 pound Weeble.)

There is also a subplot about a hurricane. I was left completely stumped by how that in any way furthered the film. There is also a demonstration of why you shouldn't go shark fishing in a tam o'shanter.

I have seen ""Piranha,"" and had previously considered it to be the worst fish movie I had ever seen, trailed very closely by ""Jaws 3-D,"" but no more: this is it, the champion all-time worst fish movie I have ever seen, or ever hope to see. It is pure and classic Grefe.",1104451200,6,2172,4.786666666666667
