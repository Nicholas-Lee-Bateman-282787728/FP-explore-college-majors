4907864,4,B005ZCSP0K,"A young political consultant working on a presidential campaign finds himself in a dilemma when a man running a rival campaign tries to woo him. His discussion with the rival puts Scampaign. This is a cleverly done political thriller that combines the real-life intrigue of a political campaign with an injection of motion picture drama that will satisfy both news junkies and movie fans. Some of Hollywood's tops actors are present, and that talent, plus the film's quick pacing make it a highly satisfying production. This one is good stuff.",1319328000,,543,5.044444444444444
4907865,4,B005ZCSP0K,"If excellence of direction and acting were all that mattered in a movie, ""The Ides of March"" would be a masterpiece. George Clooney once again shows a sure, steady hand as a director, and he is just as effective in front of the camera as a charismatic presidential candidate who may not be all that he seems. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as a young political operative, a true believer in Clooney whose faith in his candidate and the political system is about to be sorely tested. All of the performances are excellent, and two of them--Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti as rival campaign managers who match each other in sheer, Machiavellian meanness--approach greatness.

But it isn't enough for a movie to be well-made. It has to involve its audience, and ""The Ides of March"" leaves its audience on the outside looking in. The screenplay by Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon (based on Willimon's play ""Farragut North"") feels slight and cliched, despite the finely wrought dialogue. It's no secret that politics can be dirty, and that the higher the stakes the dirtier the tricks. But ""The Ides of March"" treats this as a brand-new revelation, as if people haven't been watching the news (which perhaps, to be fair, they haven't).

In the end, ""The Ides of March"" is nothing more than the story of a few days in the lives of some shallow, unpleasant people, who excel in con games and one-upmanship and virtually nothing else. That, of course, may be what politics truly is, and if so God help us all. But somehow the great political films of the early '60s--""Advise and Consent,"" ""Seven Days in May,"" and above all ""The Best Man""--made it seem more consequential than ""The Ides of March.""",1319068800,3,1706,4.779661016949152
4907866,3,B005ZCSP0K,"Excellent acting, but hearing the ""f"" word in almost every other line was a real turn-off to me. Maybe politics really is this sordid, with the exterior appearance of integrity little more than a smokescreen for the underlying multiple power struggles. The bottom line of this story is the loss of idealism and becoming a power player at the expense of one's own integrity.",1318550400,2,373,4.84375

Republicans should rejoice! Finally a movie made by liberals about ethically challenged Democrats! The setting is the Ohio primary where a liberal Governor Morris (George Clooney) is pitted against another liberal Senator, Pullman. It's all based on the play 'Farragut North', where Governor Morris is only referred to by the other characters and never makes an appearance on stage at any time. Clooney, who also directs, has injected Governor Morris into the action for the movie, and except for a strong face-off with the film's protagonist at the denouement, has little to do but mouth various Democratic party platitudes.

The film is very slow moving for a good thirty to forty minutes. The inciting incident occurs when Pullman's campaign manager Tom Duffy (played by a very believable Paul Giamatti), calls Morris' Junior Campaign Manager Stephen Myers (Ryan Gosling), who meets with him and is offered a position on the Pullman campaign. We don't really learn of the significance of this meeting until later on in the film, so we're still guessing until the break into Act Two.

Act Two also comes late. This is where Myers has bedded Molly Stearns, an 20 year old intern on the campaign, who also happens to be the daughter of the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. It turns out that Myers answers Molly's cell phone while she's half asleep and it's Governor Morris calling. At this point, one's interest in the film really picks up as we soon learn that Molly is pregnant due to her brief affair with Morris and she later becomes a bargaining chip in a tug of war between Myers and Governor Morris.

After a NY Times reporter tries to blackmail Myers by claiming to know about his meeting with Duffy, it becomes clear that Duffy has leaked the information in order to have Myers dumped from the Morris team (Why Myers actually met with Duffy in the first place, knowing full well that Duffy could have used the meeting against him, is not completely believable). An unforgiving Paul Zara, the senior Morris campaign man (played by an impeccable Phillip Seymour Hoffman), immediately disposes of Myers, who then goes to Duffy, begging him to hire him on the Pullman campaign. Duffy admits that he set Myers up and orders him to leave.

After Myers takes Molly for an abortion, she later learns that Myers has been fired from the Morris campaign. Believing that Myers will use the information about the pregnancy and abortion against Morris, thus exposing her to scandal, she takes a fatal overdose of prescription medication. Myers then uses the information to blackmail Morris, who caves in, fires Zara and promotes Myers to the Senior Campaign Manager position.

One possible plot hole still bothers me. During the investigation into the intern's death, wouldn't have the police discovered the three in the morning phone call from Morris to Molly by examining her cell phone records? This is after Morris claimed that he had little contact with Molly during a press conference. Had he thought about the implications of the phone call, Morris may not have taken Myers' 'bargaining chip', a purported suicide note from Molly, and instead resigned, after realizing that no amount of well thought out 'spin', could save him from the barrage of bad publicity.

There's a generic quality to 'Ides of March', as the story could be applied to both political parties. Nonetheless, the transformation of the idealistic Myers into a cut-throat politico, outdoing his ruthless mentors, Zara and Duffy, is a compelling theme that holds one's interest. This, even after the slow-moving intro. Clooney has only one really good scene and that's when he caves into Myers after being blackmailed at film's end. Gosling holds his own and compliments the most compelling performances served up by veterans Giamatti and Hoffman.

'The Ides of March' is in the end, more in the style of a legal thriller than documentary about what happens during a political primary. While it's not all that original, it will keep you glued to the screen once things pick up with that cell phone call from the Governor in the middle of the night.",1318291200,2,4173,4.951428571428571

The Ides of March shines, but no-one's aghast
Based on a play, this political tale
Of campaigns and whether truth will prevail

Yes, running for office ain't no backroom deal
Oh who am I kidding, but will all be revealed?
To sew up them delegates, Evan Rachel Ward
Will help old George Clooney, get his reward

Idealist staffer Gosling (or Ryan, to us)
Is the Governor's campaign number two, but then thus
After some tricks, that are dirty and aided
By Paul Giamatti, our Ryan gets jaded

And torn as he is, by this Primary choice
Philip Seymour Hoffman allows no rejoice
Reporter - manipulative - Marisa Tomei
Well, let's just say both send Ryan on his way

The kool aid he drunk now tastes bitter, not sweet
And young Ryan now facing despair at its feet
Decides it is time, to pout and then smile
For a crocodile with some charm can beguile

And a crash course he got in how to convene
A meet with the donkey on March the Fifteen
As interns and Senators, candidates all
Line up to screw us, themselves and appall",1318118400,2,1053,4.435233160621761
4907869,5,B005ZCSP0K,"Mao Tse Tung said:  Politics is war without bloodshed. War is politics with bloodshed.  Ides of March proves the truth of this.

In George Clooney's more recent movies, he has become an acting chameleon moving with the deftness and surefootedness of a mountain goat, winning five Academy Award nominations and one Oscar for Syriana.

Up in the Air I considered good though overhyped, the thriller The American, brilliant but underhyped. A  personal favorite.  I particularly loved his collaborations with the Coen Brothers, the onscreen chemistry with Catherine  Zeta Jones in Intolerable Cruelty, and the epic reimagining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B003V5CFV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>.

Ryan Gosling, I consider to be perhaps the greatest actor on the planet. Nearly every movie performance he has given has been nominated for some acting award, even though many of the movies were not mainstream.  Have you heard of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Half-Nelson/dp/B000KX0IOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Half Nelson</a>, for which he got Oscar nominated?  He starred in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-Stupid-Love/dp/B003Y5H574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>&nbsp;also starring Marisa Tomei, earlier this year, and did an amazing job.

Ides of March may be described as a political thriller, and if you're like me it will certainly grip you and have you on the edge of your seat at times, with its twists and turns.

Ryan Gosling plays a campaign assistant manager, who works for Paul played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and both work for Governor Morris, played by George Clooney, a man with eyes on the presidency.  Paul Giamatti plays a veteran campaign manager for a rival politician.  Evan Rachel Wood plays a young intern who gets sucked into the intrigues, and Marisa Tomei plays a hardscrabbling reporter always looking for dirt to dish.  In fairness, though her methods may be dubious, she is seeking the truth.

Ides of March, and its characters portray every shade of dark, and you may wonder how something as innocuous as agreeing to meet a rival for a drink in a bar can become such a potential disaster, and how going on a date with an intern when you're single can lead to such complications. Certainly Stephen Myers (Gosling)is left to wonder how minor personal actions can have such potentially dire personal political consequences.

I have to say the story is brilliantly constructed and told, and as you might expect with a political movie, it contains tons of soundbites.  We all know that politics can be quite dirty with lowdown tricks and negative campaigning, but I don't think you have seen anything quite like this except in real politics. One persons pain becomes another persons political gain.

I loved the setup and payoff of the opening and closing scenes. As the movie opens Gosling cynically delivers soundbites to camera.  The movie closes with soundbites to camera.

Early in the movie he has passion for his work, and says he wouldn't do it if he does not have faith in the candidate. Will he stay true to this when his values are challenged?

I loved the confrontations between Gosling and Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei, and Clooney in different scenes.

I loved the sexual tension in the early scenes between him and Evan Rachel Wood.

I loved the the contrast in this character who in some way cares, offering an intern in trouble a ride to and from a place, even helping her out of his own pocket, and then making the hardscrabbling choices he makes, as the Darth road beckons, and romantic ideals can disappear faster than a political friendship.

While the movie does not scream surefire Oscar winner it certainly yells, and I think Gosling will get nominated perhaps even win, particularly after being so cruelly overlooked last year for his brilliant turn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Valentine/dp/B00503B9XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Valentine</a>. George Clooney wears three hats as actor, director, and cowriter, and who better to play a smooth politician.  Hoffman and Giamatti as usual are brilliant.  Either or both could be nominated.  In fact you will see few movies with such a strong ensemble this year, with three Oscar winners on board.

I think you will enjoy it, and I hope you found this review helpful.",1318118400,6,4535,5.608504398826979

To be fair to Gosling though, hes more expressive here than usual and his performance is aided (in comparison) by those of director George Clooney, who plays some variation of his stock suave and cool character, as well as great actors like the late Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti and (briefly) Jeffrey Wright, all of whom seem to walk through this film on their way to the bank.  I think I invested more effort in watching this thing than those guys did acting in it. The female leads, Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei, at least put some effort into their roles and portray the more interesting characters in this film.

There is nothing new or even mildly surprising here, in fact this is perhaps the least provocative political thriller Ive ever seen and truly does come off as a simple money grab banking on star power, and committed to as a way to kill time between more substantial projects.  The whole thing is rendered even more pointless in contrast to a title that harkens to the murder Caesar, one of the most famous and dramatic political assassinations in history, and therefore promises much more than it delivers.

4908390,5,B005ZCSP0K,"""The Ides of March,"" captures all the twists and turns behind the scenes  of a presidential campaign revealing the trade-off for trade up.  Viewers are privy to the inner thinking of Steven (Ryan Gosling) who idealizes the candidate/ Morris (George Clooney) for whom he is campaigning and finds himself having to knock Morris off the pedestal as he fights for his job. He quickly learns that being naive and operating from integrity could be a sure way to his death as a political strategist. We literally see him grow up in a matter of hours as he processes the choices and events that led to his near fall from grace. Finally we witness his brilliance as he sees the light and uses his intellect and brawn to win and get what he wants.

Great all star cast, well written, perfectly paced  and great cinematography.",1468713600,,816,4.645833333333333

Spoiler: Plot hinges on daughter of DNC chairman having multiple one night stands but being unable to deal with an abortion without her new man (Gosling) despite Gosling's character having exactly no redeeming value. Also,mysteriously, despite her father being head of DNC she is flat broke and can't round up $900 without asking Clooney. The other plot twist is uninspiring and little more than a failed copy of a West Wing episode. And the revenge twist - a fall from moral grace - doesn't work when the character has spent the whole movie wheeling and dealing and lying and humping interns. Incredible cast wasted by terrible writing.",1466208000,2,650,5.027777777777778

The ""Ides of March"" is when Julius Caesar was murdered by his friends/enemies in the Senate because he became dictator. Sooo, this movie is poorly named.

The acting was fine, but the plot simplistic and obvious and overall, the movie reinforces a deeply cynical and generally unfair portrayal of even the most Machiavellian political operatives in campaigns. I cannot in good conscience recommend this because it reinforces the worst and most simplistic (and incorrect) stereotypes of what campaign professionals do and why they do it.

Ryan Gosling.

It's not as bad as putting Keanu Reeves in the role, but let's face it - Ryan Gosling trying to pass himself off as an intellectual heavyweight who is sharp as a tack, is like  putting Reeves in a Shakespearean play. Keanu always sounds like Bill & Ted, and Gosling always sounds like he just woke up.

The movie did also tend to fizzle out. Any suspense that would get built up would be prematurely extinguished. By the time we see Ryan Gosling at the end staring off into space, doing what he does best... I was joining him.",1465257600,2,731,4.268115942028985

First, the screenwriters had a field day pumping the movie full of their ideology, with a non-stop saturation of socialist demagogue droning.  Secondly, the movie was anti-climatic, without bringing a satisfying end to the entire script.  The only takeaway from this movie is that politicians can't be trusted, and their ideology is foolish, with no root in reality except to appeal to the uneducated (screw logic). The acting was good, but this is another case of screenwriting and political agenda trumping any opportunity to get lost in a good movie.",1464739200,,616,5.089108910891089

4909425,5,B005ZCSP0K,Good movie.  Short and doesn't try to over make the point.  The point is made in an hour and 1/2.  Ryan Gossling is the real star of this movie.  He carried it from start to finish.  Clooney is there for show and name status.  And he wanted to see this movie made so was involved in the production of it.  Might not have happened without him.

In a scandal that could throw things in the ringer the events unfold a dark and hard hitting take of how the world works behind closed doors. The style and color of this film are easily two of its strong suits. I would give this movie 4-4.5 stars for an attention to emotional and physical display. There are a few minor flaws with the edit but it has very real life language threat doesn't try to be too lofty or pretentious. A great cast, and easily a fantastic crew have worked hard to make this feature very enjoyable.
A great home date night movie for two or more people. The drama and intensity pulls back and forth with wit and discomfort.

And she did the second awful thing only a few hours after the first awful thing, which any medical half-wit would have surmised immediately.

There is one thing that I would have added to the script. It was concerning giving up your friend.

4909672,5,B005ZCSP0K,"I'm sure somebody must have noted this, but I've made a cursory search and can't find it: this is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, as the title surely suggests. Paul (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is Caesar, brought down by his subordinate Stephen (Ryan Gosling), who takes the part of the scheming Cassius.  (His last name, Zara, is even derived from ""Caesar"" or ""Tsar.)  Gov. Morris (George Clooney is the idealistic Brutus, whom Cassius convinces to depose Caesar.  In Shakespeare, it is Brutus who falls from nobility, just as it is Gov. Morris, here.  Of course, everything isn't parallel: our Caesar lives, for instance, and will make $1,000,000 per year.  That's probably about what losers get in our political world.  We even have Brutus's adoring and serene wife, Calpurnia, in the Jennifer Ehle character.  Though not all plot points or characters are parallel with Shakespeare's (nor need they be) most are.

I admire Clooney's decision, if it was indeed his, to have the ""assassination"" occur offstage, as it were, in the backseat of a car we only see from the outside, in a dirty alley, which is apt for the business being done there.  Paul goes out with the garbage.  I also like the last scene.  Gosling's dead expression leaves no doubt about how Stephen's victory tastes to him.  And there's one other thing.  Stephen tells Molly that she has to go because she has made an unpardonable mistake.  Then, he does the same thing and can't abide the same punishment he has so rigidly meted out to her.  It's a fine irony, the one on which the story pivots.  Makes you wonder which character found the best way out.

As modern political intrigue, the movie works exceptionally well.  One can believe it actually happening today.  Maybe Shakespeare's audiences felt the same way.  Maybe nothing changes in politics.

The sexual indiscretion is, of course, an addition--not in Shakespeare.  The criticism that this is a hackneyed plot element might be valid if it weren't handled so movingly, and that is all to the credit of Evan Rachel Wood, whose performance steals every scene she's in.  Clooney, Gosling, Hoffman, and Giamatti are all excellent (what a cast!), but it's Wood who, for me, settles the question of how many stars this merits.

Highly recommended,

4910290,5,B005ZCSP0K,"This is a good film.  Directed by George Clooney who shows a real talent for the skill.  GC plays a forceful politician in the middle of Primary season with his eyes on the White House.  Ryan Gosling plays the second in command of his campaign management staff. With Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei, and Jeffrey Wright in pivotal roles and in great form, I was held captive by the story and execution of the plot twists that unveil the true character of the people involved in this campaign.  The more I see of Ryan Gosling, the more I realize what a good actor he is. And George Clooney has an eye for good projects (when he's not doing his silly stuff with his friends).  Loved Michael Clayton, The American, Good Night and Good Luck, and others of this ilk.  If you like political dram with good acting and well executed, give this one a try.

4910347,5,B005ZCSP0K,"Ides of March
 Ides of March is at once one of the best made films of the year and one of the most unsatisfying.  The film is part written, part produced, directed and stars one of our most watched actors of today and one who can honestly be described as a genuine Hollywood super star.  George Clooney has a range of abilities that take him from action star to comic to very serious drama about very serious business.  This film is a very serious dram, and one so well done that the Venice International Film Festival granted it the very serious Brian Prize earlier this year.  Like all truly great tragedy, we leave the theater in somber pondering of the flawed human condition, moved but not enthralled or enthused.
 I prefer to leave the theater dancing.
 But what a strong film it is.  This is a political drama set in the very near future.  It bears immediate comparisons to the Mike Nichols directed, John Travolta staring Primary Colors of 1998.  Primary Colors was based, one hopes very loosely, on the Clinton run for the oval office.  Apparently, powerful men cannot keep their trousers on, even in vying for the very highest goal there is, the presidency.  In a blizzard of excellent performances by the leading actors in America we have Evan Rachel Wood in the Monicaesq role of the dazzled young intern who comes to a savage grief.  Wood, just 24 years old, is a veteran of many films including Thirteen (2003), The Missing (2003) and The Wrestler 2008.)
 George Clooney has the supporting role as the presidential candidate in a closely run Ohio Democrat primary contest.  The lead role is perfectly filled by young Ryan Gosling as a 30 year old wonder kid, a brilliant up and coming political operative.  Marisa Tormei plays the New York Times reporter who is as hard bitten and ruthless as any of the pols in a performance that shatters any faith one might still have in the fourth estate.  Twin theatrical titans Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman are the leaders of the rival campaigns.  If there are better actors in America than these two, I want to know who they are.
 Even third level players are quite at the top of the list.  Jeffrey Wright plays a scoundrel senator who offers to sell himself to each campaign, his honor to the highest bidder.  Wright is known lately as CIA man Felix Leiter in the recent James Bond films.  All in all, a wonderful cast in a movie that is deftly directed and well written.  But--surprise killer warning if you haven't seen the film yet, stop reading--even if in real life dishonorable men often achieve victory, we don't like scumbags triumphing in our films.  I did not leave this movie singing.
 The four saw blade film is rated R for adult themes and some sex.  It is one hour and 42 minutes long.  Executive Producer Leonardo DiCaprio and the other producers may squeeze out a profit (in contrast to Primary Colors).  The budget was a frugal $12.5 million.  The take so far is $24 million, so any more box office tickets will be in the profit zone.
 This is an excellent, well made, serious film that I found to be no fun at all.  But I am a movie-going infant.",1416182400,,3131,4.567324955116697

4910355,5,B005ZCSP0K,"I purchased the Ides of March on Wednesday September 3, 2014 after seeing it on a list of recommended movies (for a career that I am gathering more research/details on). Less than seven days later, I was fortunate in receiving an invite and being able to attend an event in George Washington that indirectly tied into certain themes prevalent in the Ides of March movie. Ryan Gosling plays the role of a popular and talented campaign manager named Stephen Myers. Stephen Myers is spearheading an election campaign for Mike Morris (played by George Clooney), a Democratic candidate for the presidency. The character of Stephen Myers in the film is doing the job equivalent of what campaign managers Stephanie Cutter and Matt Rhoades did for the 2012 presidential elections (Cutter was connected with President Obamas 2012 re-election bid and Rhoades was with Romney). Stephen Morriss character is shown being proud and strongly believing in Mike Morriss chances for election success. What adds further elements of surprise to the film is that the character of Myers receives temptation to join the other campaign. He is also tempted again when a gorgeous intern by the name of Molly Stearns (played by Evan Rachel Wood) comes on to him in a strong manner.  I want to share more about the film. However, Im intuitively guided to avoid sharing further details for those who still want to see the film. However, I must admit that I wish that the ending of the film would have went into further detail on what became of the candidates. Yes, I know that the Ides of March is a more serious movie, but doing what became of the candidates down the road even if the outcomes were fictional (such as in the more light-hearted Legally Blonde) would have added a more personal and humanistic touch. However, doing the outcomes to five years down the road or more would be ideal. This is because I feel that in life, not just in the movie (such as how college graduates are doing) many people are looking too soon at outcomes at how a man or woman is faring when a persons life can greatly change even more 3-5 years down the road.  Ides of March also features Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Marisa Tomei.",1410307200,2,2204,4.736979166666667

Based on the trailer, I had high hopes for this political thriller. However, the art of movie trailer production has reached its pinnacle these days, and often, the trailer gives an impression of a film much better than the actual product. This is a good example. Clooney's finest role was as ""Ulysses Everett McGill"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B003V5CFV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O' Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>&nbsp;(""My hair!"" ""We're in a tight spot!"" ""I don't want Fop, goddam it! I'm a Dapper Dan man!"" ""Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. Two weeks from everywhere!"") But as a director, he has a tin ear. In several places, the background music sounded as if it came from a different movie, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street/dp/B0093Q906W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still/dp/B00005JKFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>.

Advertised as based on the experiences of a staffer on Howard Dean's 2004 campaign, the incident in question must have referred to the staffer replacing his boss right before an important primary. I don't recall Howard Dean getting an intern pregnant, who then got an abortion, and turned up dead shortly thereafter. I know the ""Dean scream"" pretty much cancelled out the memory of anything else that happened during his campaign, but I'm sure I would have remembered that. Aside from artistic license (and if I was Dean's lawyer, I would sue the filmmakers for libel), the script was plodding, with rare moments of interest when someone showed an emotion. To be fair, the film was adapted from a stage play, which usually results in all talk, no action. Philip Seymour Hoffman was outstanding as always, but the total lack of chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Evan Rachel Wood, doomed the entire production. A plot inconsistency was when Gosling accidentally answered Wood's phone at 2:30 a.m. when Clooney called her. If he knew about the pregnancy, wouldn't he have arranged for the abortion? And after Gosling took care of it, wouldn't Clooney have figured out right away that Wood must have told someone else about it?

4910378,5,B005ZCSP0K,"When political candidates wear their suits, their fine haircuts, and their grins to go in front of the camera, they seem like well-kept up-right people. Few of their constituents know what goes on behind the scenes. Few people knew prior to the breaking of the Watergate scandal that President Nixon regarded political adversaries as enemies and used offensive epithets when referring to them. Few people know that Bill Clinton attacked an aid and threw him to the ground during election night of one of his gubernatorial re-election bids in Arkansas. (That aid has since become a right-wing republican.) And recently, few knew at the time that presidential-hopeful John Edwards was hiding a secret extra-marital affair which is now coming out because of a court case at this writing in April 2012. The Ides of March is about the dark sides of campaign politics exposed.

Governor Mike Morris (loosely based on Gov Howard Dean) is just about as ideal as they come in terms of presidential candidates. He's handsome, smart, articulate, and confident. In fact, confidence oozes out of him like toothpaste from a tube. Americans want that in their politicians even more than intelligence. Confidence and good-looks go further than morality and intelligence, albeit with one exception. Americans like to perceive their politicians as moral, especially in regards to their sexual life. As one character will express later, presidents are restricted from certain behaviors, while even doing things like running up national deficits can be forgiven. The only part which is a little fantastical is when Morris says he doesn't believe in God but only the US Constitution. Any presidential hopeful would be roasted alive by other candidates for making such pronouncements.

One of his top aids, Stephen Meyers, works for Morris' campaign manager, Paul Zara. They are campaigning in Ohio, one of the final stops on the primary election road. Ohio seems to be slipping from Morris. If he loses Ohio and then loses the next stop, North Carolina, his presidential bid may be over. They need the Senator from North Carolina and former presidential-hopeful Thompson to endorse, but he is reluctant to do so unless he's promised a cabinet post, possibly the Secretary of State. Morris doesn't want to give Thompson this post because he disagrees on his foreign policy. However, if Thompson refuses to endorse Morris and offer his 360 delegates, Morris will be in jeopardy of losing the nomination.

Meyers then receives a phone call from the opposition's campaign manager. Unsure what he should do, Meyers agrees to the meeting. Later, Meyers learns a dark secret from one of the interns on the campaign. Both fronts could either derail the entire campaign or jeopardize Meyers position as a top aid to the candidate. All of a sudden, Meyers becomes thrust into the center of a web of political intrigue from which he can't seem to escape.

A brilliant film about the dirty laundry of politics. Star and director George Clooney is perfectly cast as the seemingly unflappable presidential candidate. Clooney in interviews related that one of his favorite films is ""All the President's Men"" which chronicles the investigation by Washington Post reporters who exposed the Watergate Scandal. ""Ides of March"" is probably Clooney's answer to ""All the President's Men"", showing an insider's look into the politics behind the politics.

If you're not already sold on how great it is just because these three are the stars, let me continue...  This film exposes the darker side of politics and the deals that are made to get ahead.  I thoroghly enjoyed this film.  The cast was wonderful to watch, the plot was suspenseful, and the issues addressed were something to consider.  That begs the questions:  How far are we willing to go to get ahead?  How much do we want opeople to know about the mechenations of our acent?  This film doesn't clearly answer those questions but shows usone scenario that is followed.  Ryan Gosling plays a rising star in the world of campaigns and politics (he's like their Michael Jordan or something like that.)  As he helps Philip Seymour Hoffman run the campaign of George Clooney's character for the Democractic nomination for President (remember, this isn't the general election, which is a nice spin on these sorts of films), he finds himself in a sudden whirlwind of problems that ultimately leave him on the side of the road (seriously, they aren't nice enough to give him a plane ticket home...that's politics, I guess.)  Gosling's character believes he ultimately did nothing wrong (a notion the viewers can debate on their own) and plots to get himself back in by doing what every politician does...make himself more valuable (and therefore indespensible) than the other guy.  From there on out, deals are made, scandals are hidden away, and values are tested.  George Clooney comes into this film (wait, he's not getting top billing?) as a politician looking to stay honest, fight for the people, and not make any back-room deals with his less scrupulis peers...this must have worked for him somewhere along the way because he managed to become Governor of Pennsylvania, not nessesarily the bluest state in this country, as well as the favorite candidate for the Democractic nomination for President.  If you believe that his values make him soft and a push-over, you are wonderfully mistaken.  Mr. Clooney plays a confident family man and politicain who is easy on the eyes...but he's a politicain, so there are skeletons in his closet, right?  This is a film to get and enjoy over and over again.  My one complaint is that they didn't bring it into theaters on an election year.  That might have been more appropriate though I do consider the possibility of some political supporters not being thrilled about such a move...perhaps it's all for the best.

It's definitely a movie based on a play - but because of this, there is strong focus on the writing, and it includes some great speeches, including one of my favorite speeches on film I've heard about politics, in which Philip Seymour Hoffman's character explains the importance of loyalty.

Their non-reviews aside, Ides of March is a pretty good movie. It is paced well, the acting is good (especially Ryan Gosling) and the plot, while predictable, draws you in. It's about political treachery, ambition, and the ugliness therein, but more than that it speaks to the fallibility of all of us, to our naivet&eacute;, and to the battle within our hearts and minds between cynicism and hope. It reminds me a bit of All The King's Men in that respect.

This is a movie that is well done but moreover has a larger point to be made.

He finds himself being too cozy with one of the interns (Evan Rachel Wood), and all too quickly this snowballs into a complicated set of intrigues.  Clooney plays the presidential candidate, Gov.

It doesn't really seem to matter, as Clooney, who also directed the film, focuses on his press secretary's ""transformation.""

4910423,4,B005ZCSP0K,"It takes a bit of time to heat up, but ""Ides of March"" eventually turns into a taut and engrossing political drama, a down-in-the-dirt look at the ugly side of politics, human nature and the desperate manner in which the major insiders stoop to in order to attain supposed historic glory. Ryan Gosling is especially entertaining to watch as Stephen Meyers, a second-in-command campaign head honcho for fallible Governor Mike Morris (played by George Clooney). Meyers' personal fall from a persistent and hardworking semi-idealist to an ultra-cold opportunist is chilling to watch.

Unlike most Hollywood movies, ""Ides of March"" doesn't oblige viewers with a love-conquers-all sentiment and a warm, fuzzy, completely conclusive ending, which is refreshing. Clooney co-wrote the screenplay, a dark, cynical take on the political machine from top to bottom. Though the dramatic shenanigans in the movie don't occur in every major political campaign, the round-the-clock grind and pressure these campaign staffers and volunteers go through seem true to life.

With superb acting by Gosling, Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti, as well as a few unpredictable actions along the way, ""Ides of March"" is a must-see flick if you like tightrope political thrillers. My only small complaint was how fictional governor Mike Morris spewed reform ideas that were likely what the actor who played him wants out of a president. Somehow it was a bit of a turnoff to see Clooney's actor/civilian viewpoints blur into one while I was watching a movie he was in. That aside, this was a great flick.",1340409600,,1593,5.21875

4910426,2,B005ZCSP0K,"Despite its serious intentions, The Ides of March is a thriller without many thrills, and a political movie whose principle premise is sadly flawed to start with, pretty much invalidating the entire narrative process that follows. We are asked to believe that the Ryan Gosling character - presented with no backstory and identified only as the political campaign's veteran idealist - would when contacted personally by the manager of a rival campaign in the midst of a crucial primary decide to accept a private meeting, in which the latter attempts to hire him away from his job. Given what little the movie's writers have offered us so far of Gosling's character, the fact that he would entertain even taking the original phone call, much less a subsequent meeting, is absurd. It would be as if, at the opening of the Godfather, Marlin Brando takes a call from the D.A. asking him to come in for a private meeting, at which he allows himself to be asked to turn state's evidence against his family, and the movie proceeds from his rather tepid refusal to do so. There is simply no reason offered why Gosling would put himself in such a situation given especially the little we know of him.

This includes his relationship with the intern. Both are very attractive people who may well give into a momentary affair at some time, though one must wonder how Gosling at this particular point in a crucial campaign event has either the time or the reasoned excuse to succumb to his libido. We then learn that the presidential contender he works for has also had an affair with the woman, and we are supposed to believe that in this one-night stand the man used apparently no protection against pregnancy, and then has followed up the immensely dangerous incident with several cell phone calls. When Gosling is fired for the meeting we are to believe he was both so stupid and so disloyal to have taken, we are then treated with a descent into gutter politics at the slimiest level, with the contender giving into potential blackmail by getting rid of his long-time and loyal manager and hiring the blackmailer in his stead, all in the midst of the closing days of a crucial primary election.

Frankly, if there is a `thrill' in this, it is basically at how the writer's could think they'd get away with treating the viewer so insultingly. Gosling has shown signs of being one of the best of young upcoming actors, and Clooney is for me a master at the minimal acting technique as most famously utilized by the likes of Spencer Tracy and Robert Redford. Both Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman turn in expectedly excellent performances, and Evan Rachel Wood was also highly competent. Yet they are all being asked to serve what is to me a disappointing and fatally flawed script, aimed at some sort of cheap and unbelievable melodrama rather than a serious attempt at either a political thriller or a political-themed movie in general.",1339027200,,2936,4.754901960784314

Clooney is one dimensional (same vocal inflections and facial expressions he uses in every other movie he's ever been in).  Giamatti and Hoffman are good.  Marisa Tomei is so-so and not in the movie enough to really matter.

And as an actor he simply can't stand toe to toe with Hoffman's canny mood swings or the effortlessly human implosions that Clooney is so beautifully rendering in middle age. The storyline is pretty threadbare and sometimes seems channeled through ""Days of Our Lives.""

4910430,1,B005ZCSP0K,"I thought Clooney was politically savvy.  I was wrong.  23mins into this I had to give up, the political ignorance of Clooney killed this movie.

Two points prove this:  1. Gosling's character shows us his ""brilliance"" by insisting a mandatory two years public service from 18-20 was a vote getter.  After all, the people who would object don't get the vote.  Of course the appreciative audience in the room give sounds of awe at this idea.  In real life this dummy gets pelted with all the variables he conveniently left out. Chiefly  the same bipartisan overwhelming majority  against the draft, an obvious comparison, would also be against this expensive idea. And no one asked about cost? This would be a costly program. Only in Hollywood could they know less than the schmoes inside the beltway.
2.  Giamatti's ""logic"" of Ohio Republican's sabotaging the Demo's open primary has no proof in reality. The evidence suggests that open primaries don't promote strategic voting as much as they expand and moderate the primary electorate. What would a more moderate vote be in the Clooney primary be?  A Clooney win.

Yes, I know it's only a movie.  You must suspend belief to enjoy movies.  But be so open minded your brain falls out? This is a shame, such a good cast and subject matter. I Really wanted to like The Ides of March.",1338336000,6,1331,4.755458515283843

Based on a famous quote from The Tragedie Of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare, The Ides Of March had a strong premise and a good cast. So what could go wrong? EVERYTHING. First off, the film is very leftist in its tone, portraying conservative Republicans as the villains and demonizing their views on abortion and gay marriage (two hot-button issues which should be easy ones for people with common sense) as backwards and evil. Secondly, almost all the characters combine God's name eith a mild curse word, thereby making it into a strong profanity. Why is it that almost every movie has to have either a gay character or someone who speaks out in favour of that abomination, or someone who's either a democrat to their bone marrow or someone who taketh the LORD's name in vain, like saying Darn it? So, there you have it: two very strong reasons as to why a great cast and a strong premise were wasted.

4910435,3,B005ZCSP0K,"The nature of betrayal in politics is an ancient concept. Perhaps the most famous was the betrayal of Julius Caesar by Marcus Brutus that occurred on March 15, the Ides of March. Thus the title of George Clooney's 2011 political drama, THE IDES OF MARCH.

THE IDES OF MARCH revolves around Stephen Meyer (Ryan Gosling) a rising behind the scenes player in the Democratic Party. Stephen is the number two person on the campaign for Gov. Mike Morris (George Clooney). Gov. Morris is in a tight race to secure the Democratic Presidential nomination. It's a neck-and-neck race that comes down to the state of Ohio where Morris is in a dead heat with his opponent, Ted Pullman (Michael Mantell). Meyer is friends with Morris, but Meyer's boss is Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a long-time political campaigner and strategist and Morris's campaign manager. Despite knowing he is young and nave, Morris trusts Meyer to do the right thing and always report to him. In the midst of all this, the Pullman's Senior Campaign Manager, Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), pulls Meyer aside and tells him he wants to secretly meet with him. Also, Meyer's begins having a physical relationship with Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood), a young intern for the Morris campaign and the daughter the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Meyer believes himself to be on top of the world until he becomes a pawn in the political games of others. He's soon forced with a serious of decisions that will illustrate whether he has the true the power of his convictions or if he's just another politician.

THE IDES OF MARCH isn't a bad movie, but it's not great either. The acting is superb and everyone in the cast gives find performances. Ryan Gosling says more words in THE IDES OF MARCH than he's said in probably the last ten of his movies combined. Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman are always fun to watch. Evan Rachel Wood is striking and holds her own against such a heavy-hitting cast. Clooney gives his usual performance.

Where the movie really lacks is in plot. The political maneuvers of the various characters or typical and the secret that Meyer ends up having about Morris isn't something that's horrifying anymore. The elements would work better on the small screen or on the stage where the setting is more intimate, but on the larger tableau of a major motion picture, the significance of what happens and all the political intrigue is lost. Therefore, what begins as a promising political drama turns into something slightly different: just another betrayal on THE IDES OF MARCH.",1337299200,,2584,4.868181818181818

4910437,1,B005ZCSP0K,"The `March Of Dimes' tries to be a gripping political drama, but the production never had any hands!

Ryan Grosslin plays an up and coming, supa-fly campaign manager for George Clooney.  The film is centered around the Ohio Democratic Primary race and is an uninspired look into the filthy, stab `em in the back world of political ascension.  Of course, we don't really know this until roughly 60% through the movie where, up until that point, it just kind of seems like a movie where George can toss out all of the stereotypical Liberal talking points.

It goes from a study inside a heated race for political office, where everyone is seemingly a straight shooter, to a who cares who gets stepped on while I shoot for the stars because everyone's actually a liar.  It just becomes so terribly stereotypical when the little hootchie seems to mess everything up while continuing to be so dull and uninteresting throughout the entire hour and forty minutes.

But trust me folks, this political arena business is not for the weak at heart.  People you think have your back are actually having secret meetings over a cold Moosehead Ice down at the tavern, Senior campaign officials are leaking information, interns boink higher ups, there's deception, and who can trust who?

Well let me tell you something...the one thing I trust is my motion picture intuition and it told me something upon viewing this one:  I'm voting NO to this cast and crew, baby!!

I was shocked that Clooney wasn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor or Director with this as he seems to be nominated for everything he's appeared in since `Batman & Robin' (and that performance touched my very soul).  I'm unsure what all of the hype about him is as far as an actor goes because he plays every part the exact same way.  He's becoming the new Clint Eastwood (but Clint as a Director being nominated for everything he touches).  Let's branch out a little bit, Jorge!!  Come on....play a meth addict.  Play a hermaphrodite.  Show some range, Mister!!

I will say that regardless of this movie being horribly uninteresting, my boy Phil See Hoff was brilliant, as always.

The movie moves at an exquisite pace slowly at first with the ""...don't vote for me"" speech while testing the PA system in the auditorium soon to be the place of a presidential debate.

Must a more 'decent' man follow or must he pause to reconsider the choices he always has? It is not easy. And if in the process some inviolate codes are broken and some lives lost, they are considered inevitable.

The Ides of March seems to suffer from this problem as well, which has one of the best casting in recent times but is is nothing but old wine in a new bottle( pardon the cliche). Based on the account of an aide to Howard Dean and adapted from the play Beau Willimon's Broadway play Farragut North.  this story is about a democrat(George Clooney) who is running for the president but has a eye for the ladies, which is suicidal in politics. The situation is best summed up by a exchange between Gosling  ( the aide)and Clooney through these lines, ""You can lie, you can cheat, you can start a war, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't f*** the interns. They get you for that"". This is a story about dirty politics, compromised ideals and deal making through the eyes of Gosling, who not only witnesses muckraking but is eventually transformed by it.

The movie starts a bit slow and kind of thick on politics and the details of running a campaign.  After an initial sit-down, I didn't start really paying attention to the movie again until around 20 minutes later when things started warming up.  Clooney and Gosling are excellent as are all the actors.  It takes a while for things to start happening, but when they do, the show does indeed become a play-for-power thriller and is enjoyable enough.  When the movie ends you realize they've said all that needed to be said, but can't help wishing there were a bit more to it anyway.

I picked this movie up after seeing Gosling in ""Drive"" which I also liked (Drive is a more exciting movie than Ides though not without problems of its own).  Clooney and Gosling are both pretty great in this movie, apart from other criticisms that could be made about the film, and it is a fairly fun script once it gets moving.  Moral of the story (as if we didn't know this already) is that even politicians with the best intentions are bound to be compromised at some point.

  a.  It's a blatant left wing oriented film, that would think was produced by the DNC.  But ok, I can live with that.
  b.  Yea, it has a lot of ""famous"" and supposedly talented actors and you know what, they are talented.
  c.  The problem with this film is that... it's just a horribly boring film.  The writing is so lame; so full of liberal talking points, so full of tired old cliches that I'm going to have to assume that those on the liberal side of life would be embarrassed seeing this film.  It's like some demented caricature of the ideal liberal... and it's not flattering.

A threat to Morris's ambitions begins to emerge in a tightly fought Ohio primary, which brings the principles and ideals of all the protagonists into sharp focus.

Clooney directs in his typically generous fashion taking only a supporting role for himself and using his time behind the camera to allow Ryan Gosling to demonstrate further why he is one of the most interesting actors working at the moment. The rest of the supporting cast is flawless, with some of the finest actors working including Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood and in a small but crucial part, Gregory Itzin as a Democratic leader and the father of a young intern on Morris's campaign.

This is a fine, morally complex and convincing film drawing on the film makers experiences in politics - it is based on a play by Beau Willimon who worked on Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign, and Clooney's political involvement is well documented, not least with his own father's congressional campaign.

While they call it a thriller, I wouldn't say it delivers the thrills. It does offer an fictional inside glimpse of how twisted politics can be.

I think this movie ends all speculation as to whether Clooney would ever become a politician. Much to his follower's dismay, there is just too much poison in that sphere for him.

What if there was a perfect candidate? Someone you felt had it all: vision, purpose, charisma, intellect and principles that stood firm against all else? Would anything be able to pull you away from that person/presidential candidate? What if you discovered a secret that could unravel everything?

Political intrigue. Backstabbing. Twists and turns.

Clooney does a fine job as an Obama-like candidate. Gosling is the brains of his campaign who has complete loyalty only to have it tested by the rival's campaign manager, Giamatti.

There is foul language throughout the film but I think that's expected nowadays. Especially when dealing with American politics.

The Ides of March is a very strong commentary on the state of our political system and how crooked it truly is. Will you be able to trust anyone after watching this movie?",1333324800,,1338,5.054545454545455

If you're a fan of the West Wing, then Ryan Gosling is no Josh Lyman or Toby Ziegler. He's mildly intelligent in the film but certainly no political genius. His idealism is slowly eroded due a series of incidents involving an intern and the candidate, the opposition and the media. The story line bumbles along so obviously that the plot twist is completely expected and fails to surprise. I think political movies should at least critique some of contemporary culture instead of resolutely affirming it. By that I mean it uncritically affirms the current anti-authoritarian, cynical and dissolution with current American Politics in contemporary culture. Surely a film by such greats as Clooney and Seymour-Hoffman should have done more than affirm the status quo? Where is the challenge and critique? I kept wondering whether this was in fact either (1)a right-wing ploy designed to show the reality of left-wing politics, or (2) a left-wing propoganda film or (3) a cynical view that neither side is right and all engagement with politics leaves one tainted and corrupt.

The film was asthetically pleasing, and the scenes were well shot, which is why I gave it two stars. But the story will leave you rolling your eyes and groaning an ""Oh brother..."".

Working for a brilliant politician, his man is considering jumping ship when offered a job by another canny political operative.  He likes his man, but sees his own self interest.  Add to this a potential major scandal, which serves not as a crisis of values but as a potential tool to be manipulated.  This reboots his calculations, revealing him as a brilliant tactician who gets another shot at reinvigorating his career.  It is a political masterstroke, but there is nothing behind it but self interest.

This is one of the first political films in which the politician is not the principal protagonist.  As such, it is far less interesting than, say, The Candidate, where Redford struggles to stay in line with his ideals while his political consultant (Boyle) gains a degree of control that is disturbing.  It has deep things to say about the interplay of our ideals and the mechanics of elections.  Ides has none of this struggle and is just about how a smart guy gets ahead, the context matters not a wit.

George Clooney and Ryan Gosling certainly didn't steal their paychecks but the performances here are underwhelming with the noticeable exceptions of a compelling performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as the veteran campaign manager and Evan Rachel Wood who is sexy and strong as the requisite beguiling intern; at least for a while.  The twists in the story are contrived and clich.  Characters pivot and reveal with the regularity of a murder mystery which this really isn't.

As for the politics and political themes, the brief monologues by Clooney as the Democratic Presidential candidate are liberal but, they are undercut more than once by the comments of Gosling's supposedly incredibly media savvy character and the behavior and fate of almost all concerned makes Ides a movie that any Republican or conservative can watch with grim ""I told you so."" satisfaction.

So what's the point?  Some decisions are very hard?  Politics can bring out the worst in people?  Okay, so?

The movie begins with a rehearsal in an empty auditorium. There is a primary election between Governor Morris and Senator Pullman. Morris speaks about his beliefs. Who will win? Morris has a good record as governor. Does an opponent have questionable investments in a foreign country? This talk seems boring. A Senator is asked for his endorsement and delegates. They talk about ""National Service"" as a vote getter. [Cynical?] Advisor Steven gets a phone call from another insider. Its important. Is there a trick here? Talk show announcers on the radio are paid to promote the opponent. Will he take the offer? Morris talks against the death penalty (self-defeating?). Two workers talk about the law. There is talk about the polling numbers. Paul believes in what he supports. [Does he have a future?]

Morris talks about economics, where taxes were raised on everyone to benefit the rich. Then a fantasy about cars without internal combustion engines! Will he make a deal to win the nomination? [Is that unknown in politics?] Molly gets a telephone call at 2:30 am. ""What's going on?"" Molly tells about her secret. A reporter questions Steven about his meeting with Duffy. Who leaked the story? Molly is given money as a pay-off. Paul leaked the item to get rid of Steven! He explains why he values loyalty. Molly learns the news about Steven. Will her past actions have consequences? Steven goes to see Duffy. What if he has something big? Duffy explains his strategy, a win-win for him. ""Do you know her?"" A cell phone recorded Molly's last words.

Thompson offers his deal to Steven: his delegates for a Cabinet post. Morris speaks to the press. Steven makes a call from Molly's cell phone. Later he meets Morris and asks for changes. Steven talks frankly, ""she left a note"". They talk about their status. ""It's your call."" Paul gets the news. He sees Steven at the funeral. Thompson backs Morris. Morris' talk to the audience uses the usual rhetoric and clichs. A new intern arrives. [Are they fungible?] Steven's plan works. [The story of Molly is a warning for others.]

When Paul opposed making a deal so Morris could win I figured he was going away. Its like some murder mystery where a rich, powerful, and nasty person will become the murder victim. It may not be real life, but a good lesson for having good manners. Some of the language seems unnecessarily crude, as if it was for shock value, or to mask the dull spots in this drama. Deals to win elections go back to the 1820s. Any contrary story you were told in grammar or high school was just fiction. This story comes from a play, but has parts copied from reality.

Murrow in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" However, pretty images and well-composed close-ups does not a film make, and the tension he creates in the earlier part of the film dissipates as a result of the cliched ending.

4910473,4,B005ZCSP0K,"Is it possible to make a thriller without anyone pulling a gun? You bet it is. The weapon of choice, in this case, turns out to be a cell phone.

George Clooney plays a Democratic Presidential candidate running in a primary race in Ohio. His junior campaign manager, Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling), is the focus of the story, however. A series of inside political maneuvers, complicated by a love interest (the heartbreakingly beautiful Evan Rachel Wood), thrusts Meyers into confrontation with virtually every other major player in the story.

Gosling plays it marvelously as the ambitious and calculating media consultant. But George Clooney has convinced me that the key to male charisma, aside from bulging pecs or piercing eye contact, is the persuasive way you jiggle your head. The head jiggle, apparently a symptom of early-stage Parkinsons, is the key personality trait which will endear all political leaders to the nation. It certainly worked for Ronald Reagan. And probably Adolf Hitler and FDR, too. Clooney has toned it down in recent years, but he's still great at it. (The jiggle.)

At any rate, Ides of March is a superb political thriller, which really will give you the feeling of being nose-to-nose with the inner workings of a big-league political campaign. When things start to go wrong for Meyer, it is in an unbearably tragic sense, and yet one must remember that Meyer's life is never in danger. Even his career will survive. But someone must die, and this one really hurts.

The political speeches and ill-timed applause struck me as phony, but then so do the real life speeches we hear on the news these days. The audiences are all cued up and ready to create the needed aura of consensus. But even contrived audiences don't applaud and cheer after every single sentence, as they do in Ides of March.

Otherwise, Ides of March is just about perfect, and full of unexpected twists and turns, which, in slightly over 90 minutes, are made with great directness and efficiency. I was never, ever bored or in a state of incoherence.

Meyers is in a high pressure environment, but under the circumstances he navigates from ethical to unethical. The moral of Ides of March is that, in an electoral system where winning is everything, the unethical will prevail, and under unrelenting pressure, morals will fall by the wayside.

However, in an era that perceives most politicians as unreliable, duplicitous and self-serving, what made this movie so compelling for me was the story of an idealist (Gosling).

In his recent reincarnation as political messiah, George Clooney has an annoying habit of making political films (""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" ""Syriana,"" ""Michael Clayton"") that are aim at provoking our sense of fairness and angering our sense of decency, but which ultimately just make us angry and frustrated at having wasted two hours of our lives.  The same goes for ""The Ides of March,"" about a ""best media mind of our times"" political strategist caught in a whirlwind of political idealism and office politics.

 Rated ""R"". Running Time: 1 hours, 41 mins.

  Stephen Meyers is the Junior campaign Manager for Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), a democrat, who is running for President. Meyers does everything he can to make Morris look good in the limelight. He can even smooth-talk the reporters. This Ohio Primary is a very important one for Governor Morris to win.
  Meyers gets a phone call from another Campaign manager Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) to meet him at a bar. He says no one will be there.
 Duffy wants Meyers to quit the Morris campaign and join Ted Pullman's campaign, who is running against Morris.
  The Governor's campaign is trying to get Senator Thompson's (Jeffrey Wight) endorsement to get the delegates. Meanwhile Pullman's campaign is also after Senator  Thompson's acceptence.
  More twists are about to come Stephen Meyers way.

  While the movie seemed to be promising, it gives you an ending that leaves you hanging.

4910487,5,B005ZCSP0K,"Stop what you're doing and make a note to rent this movie at first opportunity. It is a fantastic movie with fabulous performance by famous actors: George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Evan Rachel Wood, Marisa Tomei ... as starters.

I am exceptionally picky about what I watch. A friend's opinion is good, but never a deciding factor. The well-worn saying, ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"" applies here, albeit it actually doesn't ring true for books. (I judge all books by their cover.) Initially, looking at the cast, you gotta be impressed. But wait ... aren't there a lot of movies (ala Valentine's Day) that have a host of celebrities but fall flat? So far, this cover's looking mighty good.

Cast aside, I always base my decision on one famous reviewer: Roger Ebert. Like me, Ebert really loves movies. So, instead of looking at what's wrong, he always starts by looking at what's right. If Ebert likes a movie, it's gotta be a winner. That's why I jumped at the chance to catch ""The Ides of March"" when it was on sale awhile back. If I had known how good it was, I would have watched it immediately. In fact, I'm kicking myself for waiting as long as I did.

I'm not gonna discuss the plot except to say it's outstanding, the actors except to say everyone got it right, and the director. OK, maybe I will touch upon the direction. Clooney actually directed this film ... and he did an outstanding job. I've never been a big Clooney fan ... he's not my type ... but I have enjoyed many of his films. I'm not sure I ever believed he could direct, whereas now I'll be on the lookout for those films he does do.

All I really want to tell you is don't base your judgment on the rating Amazon viewers gave it (3 out of 5 stars). It's 5 stars all the way. Anyone who doesn't agree with me, clearly knows nothing about movies.

I loved it -- that's obvious, right? OK. Now for this prediction: you will, too. That is unless you don't like movies with dazzling stars, incredible acting, perfect plotting and clever camera cuts. See ""The Ides of March."" Today, if possible!",1329609600,,2110,4.484375

That is mostly because Ryan Gosling is in pretty much every scene, and he is superb, and fun to watch. He plays a deputy campaign manager, whose ideals and ethics are challenged as the political maneuverings of the campaign unfold and get progressively more cut-throat. The other actors - George Clooney as the candidate, Phillip Seymour-Hoffman as the lead campaign manager, Paul Giamatti as the opponent's manager, Marisa Tomei as a journalist, and Evan Rachel Wood as an intern, are all excellent as well. This is a 'tight' film, with most scenes focused on the actors' faces, so it's true that there is not a lot of 'action' a la chase scenes or physical feats. This particular cast is a group whose faces I could never tire of watching in a film, so their excellence keeps it from being boring to me.

As for this being an ideological movie, I really don't feel that is the case at all. It is a political drama, in that the setting is political, but it is more of a psychological drama than a political statement. Although we do see George Clooney's candidate making speeches that might very well reflect Clooney's liberal politics, considering the scandal that eventually unfolds I think it's hardly fair to say that the point of this movie is to somehow bolster a liberal position. If anything it is a fairly cynical, unflattering look at the game of politics overall, regardless of ideology. And as I said, it is more of a psychological drama than anything else, as Gosling's character struggles to reconcile his idealism with ethical reality.

However, ""The Ides of March"" shows us just how difficult a campaign can be. Whether you consider yourself Conservative, Liberal or Independent, you can enjoy this film, for I don't believe Clooney's intent was to make a political statement.

For a general plot description, the film is about the campaigns of candidates Mike Morris (Clooney) and Arkansas Senator Ted Pullman. Both candidates are going for the Democratic nomination in the presidential election. Morris's campaign is managed by Stephen Meyers (Gosling) and Manager Paul Zara (Seymour Hoffman) while Pullman's campaign is managed by Tom Duffy (Giamatti). Both candidates are trying to get the endorsement of North Carolina Democratic Senator Franklin Thompson, who controls 356 delegates. Whoever gets his endorsement will have enough delegates to take the nomination.

The pitch-perfect supporting cast is rounded out by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, & Marissa Tomei.  The film provides a sobering look at the brutality of political campaigns and definitely makes a statement on political idealism, ambition, and the nature of relationships between the mentor & the protege, as well as the ""use-or-get-used"" relationship politics has with the media.

If this film came out before the John Edwards debacle, I might have reflected on the unlikelihood of this type of drama happening in campaigns.  But truth, as it turns out, IS stranger than fiction.

Marisa Tomei plays a NYT reporter who claims she is sleeping with Hoffman, apparently something in her movie contract requires her to either have sex with Hoffman on screen or at least claim she does. I like this second option better because I don't think I can handle another film looking at Hoffman's huge naked butt. Hoffman provides us with an endless stream of profanities as he figures out how to get the populist Clooney elected.

Giamatti works for Pullman and attempts to recruit the idealistic Gosling to his campaign. It seems the GOP is going to ask their minions to vote for Pullman. Meanwhile intern Molly (Ward), who is the daughter of the head of the DNC, throws herself at Gosling who can't resist.

As it turns out Clooney is not the saint Gosling initially believes and he is forced to walk a tightrope until the rope breaks and he doesn't know where to land. The acting was great as expected from the cast. Evan Rachel Wood stood out among the stars. The script was at times trite, but the actors managed to make good deliveries.

It is seen through the eyes of Stephen ""Stevie"" Meyers played by Ryan Gosling, as he maneuvers difficultly through the chaos, swagger, and rules that follow a presidential hopeful.  Stevie writes the words that Governor Mike Morris (Clooney) takes to the stand for every rally and debate.  He is an idealist, persuading candidates to say words that will cause change while sustaining strong percentages in the polls.  We join this film near the end of the primaries, where it is down to two candidates reaching for support in Ohio.  If they can favor the votes of Senator Thompson, that particular candidate will take the lead, and the dominos for the rest of the election will fall.  Helping Morris and Stevie as head of the campaign is Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), whose arch rival, Tom Duffy (Giamatti) runs the office of the opposing candidate.  Tensions are tight as Thompson wavers between Morris and rival, questioning each one's values and pushing them into dark corners.  Meanwhile, Stevie makes a bold decision to dip his toe in the rival's pool.  This, oddly, is the catalyst for the balance of this film.  We watch, at times nervously and at other times cautiously, as Stevie discovers a young flame within the polling station, only to see that flame extinguished by the man he has pledged allegiance to.  The lines are then blurred between power and corruption, and a very real, very nightmarish vision of politics is discovered.  Remember, those with information hold the puppet's string.

There is no question that politics is dirty.  Every four years, we watch as candidates get slung through the mud, hoping to come out the other side with the biggest slice of our apathetic vote.  The Ides of March doesn't try to show us a glorious side to politics, or change the perception of the truth; but in the same sense, it proves that it has nothing new to show us.  George Clooney has crafted an extremely safe film that boasts a phenomenal cast, but a mediocre story.  The journey Clooney takes us on through the eyes of Gosling never quite reaches the level of lukewarm.  Equipped with odd side chapters, lumpy characters, and a twist that could be seen from the posters alone, The Ides of March becomes a cinematic oddity.  What was Clooney's goal?  What type of film is this supposed to be?  Are we witnessing the transformation of a young idealistic staffer into the darkness of politics?  Is Clooney demonstrating the normality of intern struggle with his introduction of Jill Morris?  What does this film mean today?  Or is he showing that no candidate, no matter how good he sounds on paper, is flawed?  These seem like the questions Clooney wanted to ask, but was concerned about mass audience appeal.  Which would be safer; crafting an Oliver Stone-esque conspiracy movie or a film that would resonate with the Thursday afternoon geriatric watcher?  There were no boundaries broken, no political mayhem to sink our teeth into, or any impressive characters.  His Good Night, and Good Luck (or better yet Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) was more of a taut thriller than this film.  The Ides of March had the makings of an impressive film to dazzle your eyes and your mind, but in the end it felt like a political afterthought. (or better yet, a redundancy)

With Clooney fumbling behind the camera, it was up to our actors to take control.  If the ship is sinking, do you jump ship or save the remaining passengers?  For Ides of March, everyone jumped ship.  This was Ryan Gosling's year, with Drive and the simple, yet effective, Crazy, Stupid Love, it is disheartening that his worst performance of the year will be his 2011 swan song.  Devoid of emotion and scattered with reason, one could not grasp who Stevie Meyers was, will be, or even wanted to be.  A proprietor of truth and reason, this changes instantly when faced with a dilemma.  Gosling's stumbling introduction also creates chaos for the viewer because as we believe him to be true to Morris' campaign; but he is not afraid to visit with Duffy?  What led Gosling to this point of imbalance?  We need someone to guide us through a film, and Gosling couldn't keep his head above this Clooney mess.  The same can be said for Hoffman, Giamatti, and even Clooney himself.  Pretentiousness aside of casting yourself as the presidential hopeful, at least define yourself.  The ""kitchen"" conflict felt forced and unwelcomed in this film.  The Ides of March felt like a coven of bickering girls vs. a true political pot-boiler.  Clooney would have been more apt to title this Mean Girls 2.  Surprisingly, the only saving character in this film is Marisa Tomei, which speaks to (my opinion) the truth of this movie.  She plays the swarthy reporter assigned to follow the nagging characters.  She is seen bantering back and forth, a playful game of cat and mouse, when Gosling approaches her with his emotions.  She rebuffs with a great speech about not being his friend, that this was a job.  She felt like the only glue to the rest of the characters, and the only interesting character in the entire film.

I cannot understand how The Ides of March received the praise that it did.  It is Clooney's sloppiest film to date, and despite the great cast, they all  walk through this film with mediocrity like it was a Tuesday at the office.  The intensity was missing, the big surprise ending wasn't there, and the emotional drama seemed to be forgotten, so it left us with just a splattering of what could have been a great movie.  The Ides of March could have been a political film that really dove deep into the world of presidential candidates, but instead it played soft, gripping us to nothing except the final ending credits.  It was a major disappointment, leaving the average viewer with too many questions and not enough answers.  Gosling and Clooney had better films this year.",1327536000,2,5998,4.799024390243902

4910523,3,B005ZCSP0K,"""The Ides of March"" is a cynical, weird look behind the scenes of a fictional American presidential primary campaign, based on the play ""Farragut North"" by Beau Willimon. Willimon worked on Howard Dean's 2004 campaign, among others, so he should have some insight, though this story seems to take inspiration from John Edwards' campaign as much as any other. George Clooney co-wrote and directed the film, in addition to taking on a supporting role. Steven Meyer (Ryan Gosling) is the deputy campaign manager for idealistic Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Morris (George Clooney). Meyer is a shrewd up-and-coming political strategist with a touch of idealism himself, working under seasoned campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman).

When Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti), campaign manager for a rival Democratic candidate, asks Meyer to abandon Morris and come work for him, Meyer turns him down...but doesn't tell his boss, Paul Zara. What he does do is have an affair with a well-connected but unstable intern (Evan Rachel Wood), as Paul tries mightily to get the endorsement of North Carolina Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright), who controls a critical 356 delegates. Political and personal intrigues ensue.

This script is clever up to a point, though it would have been more fun to watch the clever characters, Paul and Tom, play cat and mouse, instead of watching emotionally unstable characters implode. If ""The Ides of March"" is supposed to be a comment on a corrupt political system, or the corrupting influence of power, or a lament for idealism, its success depends upon convincing the audience of its reality. But I didn't buy it. Meyer comes across as a nut. And would anyone put his political career in the hands of someone who blackmailed his way onto the staff? No. It's unrealistic. Not insightful. Meyer is so irrational that it occurred to me that's why idealistic people shouldn't be in politics. So I think ""The Ides of March"" has the opposite effect from what was intended.",1327449600,,2004,5.1067073170731705

4910525,5,B005ZCSP0K,"Spoiler alert: This review reveals plot details.

This is not a story of success or failure. This is not a love story or one of romantic revenge. Nor is it a war story, or chase, or crime drama-- But, in a way, it is all these things. ""The Ides of March"" is exactly what the title indicates: the story of the devolution of an idealist. Like Brutus before him, Steven Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is the idealist who adheres to a positive political agenda of his candidate-and-boss-in-one. His beliefs are assailed through a young campaign worker, an intern, if you will. Yes, an intern and all the inherent dangers that crowd this position.

Ryan Gosling is one of the finest young actors working today in film (as I have proclaimed in another review, that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Valentine/dp/B0036TGTDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Valentine</a>). He possesses a studied intensity portrayed to perfection. Much of his acting in this film is facial performance. The viewer must watch this assistant campaign manager, whose ideals match exactly with the candidate for President, Mike Morris, whose behavior gradually reveals that he has things in common with former President Bill Clinton.

The director is George Clooney, who uses foreshadowing, literary devices, musical patterns, light and shadow, and finely-tuned acting to reveal both a devolution of belief and the standard, expected betrayal of character by the candidate. Marisa Tomei, as a highly acclaimed reporter, even warns Steven that ""he [Morris/Clooney] will disappoint you."" Of course, she is right.

In fact, the downright most effective scene is the horrifying portrayal of the candidate's corrupt nature in a late night meeting. Director Clooney uses light and shadow on his own face to make that handsome face appear grotesque and frightening. Later, when Morris wears his dazzling smile, the viewer can no longer see him as handsome, but as a gargoyle-like being. To some extent, everyone wears a mask of some sort. Peel off that public mask and there's a degree of evil in all humans. Apparently, Clooney believes this really true of political persons.

Behind many scenes which anticipate more revelations of unconscionable character and shady doings, Clooney uses a musical pairing of timpani and violins--the lows and highs (more or less) which exude frisson, a French word referring to that primitive raising of hair on one's neck. This same pairing in the closing credits suggests the repetitive pattern of anticipation, betrayal, anticipation, betrayal, so common in life.

Even the advertisement itself is another of Clooney's clever use of contrast. Note the wide-eyed innocence of Steven's face and the darker, more twisted brow of the candidate. Physical appearance is both revelatory and deceptive, just as characters, just as life.

The more subtle or blatant foreshadowing (depending upon the viewer's knowledge of Shakespeare and Roman history) Clooney uses is the title itself, ""The Ides of March,"" or literally March 15. In the Shakespearian play Caesar's former and current friends and political buddies publicly assassinate him in the Roman Senate. In Greek plays a protagonist dies usually from hubris, or overweening pride. Caesar's hubris was his political ambition to rule in a time of political unrest, to bring order to the country through his dictatorial rule. But no, his buddies will deny him that absolute power. Morris also has revolutionary and innovative plans to revive this country. There's a twist in this story. Instead of murder, control becomes the ruling factor.

In this version Clooney also shows the ""murder"" of idealism with another layer of subterfuge by the idealist character. Steven will see to it that the Morris will do all the worthy things he promises and will make up for his wrongdoings. However, I propose that Clooney suggests that Steven, too, will eventually turn to corruption, perhaps a layer at a time.

The multitude of symbols, layers of story, foreshadowing propels the story into dangerous political territory--that is, the nature of involvement, both paid and volunteer, what it means, what it can do, how it can harm, how it can help.

Clooney, as director, creates a magnificent product, in some ways reminiscent of Hitchcock. His cast is stellar. Evan Rachel Wood has less to do than the men, but her role is pivotal to all that follows. Paul Giametti, as Duffy, the campaign manager for the other candidate, reveals a shocking motive for his dubious behavior in a short, but brilliant scene. As usual, Philip Seymor Hoffman is masterful.

All these factors together, ""The Ides of March"" offers a modern examination of the political system through exquisite acting, meaningful symbols, and subtle, but powerful directing. The closing scene--a focus on Gosling's face--is the epitome of what both Clooney and the film are about.",1327363200,7,4922,5.313624678663239

If you're still nave about the nature of politics and politicians, perhaps it's time to see the cynical truth; things are much the same as it was between Caesar and Brutus.  But when I hear the hypocritical, self-serving remarks of potential candidates for a Presidential nomination, Clooney's movie seems suddenly tame and reserved.  Ryan Gosling is terrific as an idealistic political advisor whose eyes have been opened to the ease of selling one's soul to gain power -- and perhaps revenge.

4910527,3,B005ZCSP0K,"Ides of March really, really needed a script editor before filming, since this promising movie veers off course badly at the climax. The film has a challenge: how can it teach us something new about the obvious truth that political aides involved in presidential campaigns need to be crafty and nasty and charming and ruthless where need be? Ryan Gosling is good as the razor-sharp overconfident media consultant to a Democratic contender who suddenly finds himself in way, way over his head, entangled in a scandal that could easily end the presidential bid of his man. Halfway through the viewer is gripped and then it all starts to fall apart as we're asked to swallow one too many blatant script stumbles (how could the police not investigate that incident more thoroughly? How did that character set up a crucial meeting with someone would never have agreed to talk to him?). The purely political scenes are fast-paced and enjoyably brutal yet the film is much less sure of itself when dealing with various more romantic entanglements.

4910529,2,B005ZCSP0K,"Ok, more like 'several' scumbags. A campaign aid/strategist who deludes himself into thinking that he's really an idealist who is above the dirty politics (all the while smearing his opponent, sacrificing ethics for wins, etc.); a campaign manager who recognizes that he's in it to win it and that's all; his evil twin, on the opposing campaign; and the politician himself, who talks a good game but has few ethical boundaries that he's not willing to cross. Throw in a potentially campaign-derailing scandal, some career ending mistakes, and all the treachery you imagine in the world of politics, and you've got...an actually fairly boring movie.

This should have been more exciting. The actors all did a fine job. The scenario wasn't bad. But somehow, this movie just seemed drawn out and not terribly exciting. This is, basically, a story of unprincipled scumbags winning the day -- by being even more unprincipled than the next guy. It's hard to feel for such characters, so I give the movie credit for doing a good job of portraying unlikeable political ""kings"" and ""king makers"". But it still, somehow, was not very engaging...it was like watching a death scene that lasted an entire film -- the time it took the main character's principles to slowly wither and die.

4910535,4,B005ZCSP0K,"""The Ides of March"" focuses on the dirty game of politics, how we compromise our ideals and, yep, drink the kool-aid when it comes to believing in the political figure we vote for/work for/admire.

George Clooney's film focuses on a brilliant junior campaign manager Stephen Meyers(Ryan Gosling) who discovers that the candidate he believes in for the democratic nomination governor Mike Morris (Clooney in a nice subtle performance)and the campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman)mentoring him are playing the game of dirty politics even within the faithful themselves. Zara wants to win at all costs while Morris claims he doesn't want to compromise his ideals when it comes down to the wire he's more than willing to do so to gain the electoral votes from a senator (Jeffrey Wright) that he despises.

The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a top notch transfer. Blacks are deep and rich. Colors don't exactly pop but they are not supposed to as the film has a somewhat subdued palate. Skin tones are nice throughout.

Audio isn't all that active but the film has a nice 5.1 mix with dialogue clear. Subtitles in English are provided.

The cast is top notch with great casting including Marisa Tomei, Paul Giamatti as the opposing campaign manager, Max Mingella and Rachel Evan Wood as Meyers' love interest. Clooney does a great job of balancing his role as director and co-star in the film avoiding the temptation to make the film about him an dhis performance.

Although well made ""The Ideas of March"" works best in the first half of the film as Meyers tries to reconcile his idealistic belief in HIS candidate and Paul with what he finds out truly motivates both of them to achieve their goals. Politics aside, ""The Ides of March"" could have been made about a Republican, Independent or Tea Party candidate and still resonate. The film could just as easily have been made for HBO as a theatrical release.

The special features for the film are good but limited. We get an insightful commentary track from director Clooney and co-writer/producer Grant Heslov.

""Developing the Campaign is a standard ""making of"" featurette that doesn't really provide much insight.  ""On the Campaign: The Cast of The Ides of March"" is a bit too much on the fawning side with the cast discussing working Clooney as co-writer/director and cast mate.

""What Does A Political Consultant Do?"" has a great title but doesn't give us much insight into what their job truly is and we don't get much insight into the behavior in the film and how it reflects on reality.

Stephen Meters (Ryan Gosling in a brilliant performance) is an idealistic staff member of Governor Mike morris (George Clooney) in his race for the Ohio primary against  Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell).  Steve believes in Morris' idealism and is free of corruption until he comes under the spell of the campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman, also superb),  The campaign is close and much depends on the support of Senator Thompson (Jeffrey Wright) who owns over 300 delegates and is holding out his support for payola as a promised Secretary of State position.  Thompson's campaign manager is the smart and smarmy Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) who is not beyond the darkest moves to manage his candidate's victory. Both camps are hounded by the press in the form of Ida (Marisa Tomei).  One of Morris' interns - Molly (Evan Rachel Wood), who happens to be the daughter of the powerful DNC chairman jack Stearns (Gregory Itzin) - is beautiful and smart and seductive and wins the attention of the idealistic Steve, a liaison that eventually leads to the uncovering of some very dark secrets that alter Steve's idealism, making him just as cynical and dirty as those around him.

Yes, political thrillers such as this have been done before, but this one manages to address the issues of idealism versus greedy two-faced cheating and corruption better than the others.  Much of this is due to Clooney's excellent direction but the success of the film is also due to the line of exceptional performances by Gosling, Clooney, Hoffman, Giamatti, Wright and Wood.  There are small supporting roles by Jennifer Ehle and Max Minghella that enhance the overall drama.  It may be too frank for many viewers, but it is a microscopic view of the process through which we move to elect the President of this country - and that process is flawed and difficult to observe as it is defined here.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 12",1326844800,2,2811,4.9258474576271185

I guess this is more of a 'heads up', because if you don't happen to be of George Clooney's political persuasion - 'Rich White Man's Guilt'- you will be apt to shut it off after the first few howlers.

4910554,3,B005ZCSP0K,"It doesn't get much better than the talented and award winning cast of IDES OF MARCH. Ryan Gosling absolutely shines as Stephen Meyers, a talented young campaign strategist for Governor Mike Morris, played by George Clooney. Hey, who wouldn't want George Clooney for president? I read that this film was a political thriller so that caught my attention, yet this film is incredibly slow-moving.
CNN and the other news networks are filled with stories about the presidential primaries. Seeing the working from the campaign side was not that appealing in a movie. It was a full 45 minutes before the ""action"" or anything remotely thrilling began. Of course, the audience gets teased into expecting something really exciting and it never pans out. Politics is dirty business at times and there is a lot of unpleasant going-ons. Meyers begins to stray from his honest ideals to become ""one of them.""
So much potential for drama and a fascinating story are missed here. The cast of actors is incredible and includes many of the great actors around yet their talents are wasted.
Kudos to Ryan Gosling for making the most of his role. He shines in the film. This man has talent and can do light romantic comedies to series drama. He is the one piece of this rather movie that makes it bearable.",1326844800,,1287,4.801801801801802
4910555,5,B005ZCSP0K,"Governor Mike Morris is gunning to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. His secret weapon?  Hotshot speechwriter/campaigner Stephen Meyers.  Stephen has the experience to make this happen, and he also believes.  But his belief soon becomes his own handicap, and he finds himself immersed in the endless maelstrom that is U.S. politics.

The plot of IDES isn't wholly original; it's interesting, and definitely provokes a few thoughts, no matter your political beliefs (Morris is a Democrat, but he could easily belong to either party).  However, three factors help anchor this film.  The first is director George Clooney, who has rarely been this confident behind camera (I've found his previously directorial efforts a mixed bag of goodies, personally).  The second factor is the script, from Clooney and Grant Heslov (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK), which takes its characters through a wide range of emotions without ever becoming maudlin or cliched (well, mostly).

The third factor, and the most important one, is the acting.  Ryan Gosling gave two stand out performances in 2011: DRIVE and IDES.  And the two couldn't be more different.  DRIVE saw him being basically a human android, discovering his heart (or sort of); IDES is the exact reverse, with Gosling going from a (sort of) idealist to a (sort of) realist.  The performance anchors the film; this is Gosling's vehicle, make no mistake, and he carries it magnificently.  Clooney, as Morris, is solid, but he doesn't have much to do; he's a supporting character in his own play.  All of the smaller roles are cast perfectly: Philip Seymour Hoffman as Meyers's boss; Paul Giamatti as the competition's conniving campaign manager; Jeffrey Wright as a senator around whom the whole film hinges; and especially Evan Rachel Wood as an intern who gets tragically caught up in the whole mess.

THE IDES OF MARCH isn't quite a political thriller; it's more of a character study that happens to be about politics.  Can you take it as a political metaphor for our times?  Yes.  But at it's heart, IDES is a personal film about one man's realization that the world can get along just fine without him...and what he aims to do about that.  It may not become the award winner that it deserves to be, but make no mistake: it is a great film filled with fantastic performances.  Not one to miss.",1326758400,3,2365,4.924242424242424

4910558,4,B005ZCSP0K,"I saw The Ides of March (101 min.) again in the movie theatre this past weekend. If you wonder why this is still playing in the theatres here 3+ months after its original release, read on... The Ides of March is a political drama co-written and directed by George Clooney, and reminding us of some earlier Hollywood election/political dramas. While there is nothing earth-shattering as such in this movie, I nevertheless enjoyed this movie (even after this past weekend's repeated view) tremendously from start to finish for a couple of reasons:

(1) the acting is superb, starting with Ryan Gosling who had an amazing year in 2011 with head-turning roles in Crazy Stupid Love, Drive, and The Ides of March. But wait! There is much more: Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti are equally terrific as the warring campaign managers, and Marisa Tomei and Evan Racheal Wood also provide some juicy parts. Clooney himself is probably the least interesting part in the movie. But what he lacks on the screen, Clooney makes up for it from the director's chair as he helms this movie confidently and brings us a well-written and at times tense political drama movie.

(2) much of the outside scenes of the movie were filmed in and around Greater Cincinnati exactly a year ago. When filming began in Cincinnati, there was a huge buzz around town about spotting Clooney or Gosling here or there. If you live in Greater Cincinnati, it truly adds an extra layer of fun to be able to recognize much of the scenery: Over the Rhine, Fountain Square, Head First Sports Bar (in downtown), the Millenium Hotel (also downtown), the Suspension Bridge viewed from the Northern Kentucky side, Northside, Xavier University, Miami University, etc. etc., just to name those. Ironically (or worse), the film credits as shown in theatres at the end list this as ""filmed in Michigan"", where indeed much of the interior scenes were filmed, but not much of the outside scenes. This ""oversight"" is thankfully being corrected for the DVD release. There are tons other CIncinnati-related references in the movie that will go straight over one's head for anyone not from here. Indeed, watching this movie as being from Cincinnati brought a certain ""insider"" glee that made me smile throughout the movie. But no worries, if you're not from around here, you are still bound to enjoy ""The Ides of March"" quite a bit.",1326672000,,2382,4.893564356435643

When the Ohio primary is in jeopardy the campaign has a tough decision to make. When Stephen talks to the opposition and discovers a secret that could ruin Mike's chances his morals are challenged. Being a political science major I really enjoy movies like this. I know most people may not but I do think that this one is different. For a movie that is basically an hour and a half of talking it moves very quickly, keeps you interested and is very tense. Focusing mainly on the dirty politics and deals made in order to get someone elected this will both interest you and make you wonder if this is accurate (which I hope it's not). This is one of the best political thrillers I have ever seen. The only problem I can see is that it's not a multiple re-watcher. I give it a B+.",1326672000,,923,4.4674556213017755

4910561,3,B005ZCSP0K,"Is a principle worth the sacrifice of the greater good? What if the agent of that change is not who you thought they were? Questions regularly posed in politically-themed dramatic efforts and so posed in this latest offering from long-time Hollywood favorite George Clooney and the recent favorite of movie-goers Ryan Gosling.

  Stephen Meyers (played by Gosling) is a veteran of numerous political campaigns and a revered media maestro. He's in a bitter contest seeking the Democratic Party nomination for his candidate. That being Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania (played by George Clooney). Because of peculiar voting rules, his is most likely going to be defeated by Republican voters who are voting in their opponents' primary in hopes of seeing a weaker candidate that they could trounce in a general election. With another upcoming primary that, if won, could clinch the nomination. To win the latter contest, however, they would need to strike the kind of deal that the candidate refuses to make on moral grounds. All this is merely the foreground while the background is replete with backstabbing and illicit affairs.

  I am not one of those who only recently heard of Gosling thanks to much-lauded efforts such as Blue Valentine, Drive, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. I have known of him since the independent 2001 film The Believer. And he is true-to-form here as a man who's greatest weakness is his faith in his leaders and purpose. Everyone, Clooney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, are doing superior jobs in compelling roles.

4910565,5,B005ZCSP0K,"This is a blockbuster film with a blockbuster cast and a blockbuster topic, which is timely and fairly realistic. We see a charismatic candidate in the presidential primary in Ohio and we get to watch the jockeying for position among his staff, his supporters and his potential endorsers. We're looking at a highly principled contender with a staff that's determined to win at any cost, so of course it becomes a question of idealism vs pragmatism. Don't forget, contemporary politics is a blood sport!

A budget this big can afford this cast:

  * George Clooney (""Up in the Air"") is our candidate, perfectly clad, perfectly coiffed, with a perfect family and a finely tuned platform; slick, sincere and electable.
  * Ryan Gosling (""Drive"") is an up-and-coming campaign professional who makes a tough job look easy. He can resist the siren song of headhunters because he believes in his candidate.
  * Paul Giamatti (""Win Win"") is the wily campaign manager for the loyal opposition, who understands that sometimes it's easier to give voters a reason to vote against a candidate.
  * Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Moneyball"") runs the show for our candidate. He's been in the business a long time and understands the value of loyalty.
  * Marisa Tomei (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is a political hack for the New York Times. She has sources that would make any politician weep, but her hair looks like straw!
  * Jeffrey Wright (""Source Code"") commands a huge block of Ohio delegates but he wants the promise of a Cabinet post before he will endorse anybody!
  * Evan Rachel Wood (""The Wrestler"") interns for the candidate and his staff: she runs for coffee, delivers hard copy to meetings and generally provides a multitude of services. BTW, they need real coffee in those containers; the actors don't handle them realistically!

We see the usual strategy meetings punctuated by the usual profanity but this well-crafted drama is highly watchable and entertaining all the way. I'm sure the R-rating is mostly due to language. Just remember, watching how a politician gets elected is similar to visiting a sausage factory, i.e., we really do NOT want to know what goes into it.

Bottom line: It's fun to see George Clooney, who worked on the screenplay and also directed, use this forum as a soapbox for his own personal agenda. Good luck with that, George.

So this unstable attitude nurturs the whole film; the internal discrepancies around the pulse of the public opinion without leaving aside the ethical aspect behind stage.

4910568,4,B005ZCSP0K,"Mao Tse Tung said: Politics is war without bloodshed. War is politics with bloodshed. Ides of March proves the truth of this.

In George Clooney's more recent movies, he has become an acting chameleon moving with the deftness and surefootedness of a mountain goat, winning five Academy Award nominations and an Oscar for Syriana.

Up in the Air I considered good though overhyped, the thriller The American, brilliant but underhyped, a personal favorite. I particularly loved his collaborations with the Coen Brothers, the onscreen chemistry with Catherine Zeta Jones in Intolerable Cruelty, and the epic reimagining O Brother, Where Art Thou?.

Ryan Gosling, I consider to be perhaps the greatest actor on the planet. Nearly every movie performance he has given has been nominated for some acting award, even though many of the movies were not mainstream. Have you heard of Half Nelson, for which he got Oscar nominated? He starred in Crazy, Stupid, Love also starring Marisa Tomei, earlier this year, and did an amazing job.

Ides of March may be described as a political thriller, and if you're like me it will certainly grip you and have you on the edge of your seat at times, with its twists and turns.

Ryan Gosling plays a campaign assistant manager, who works for Paul played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and both work for Governor Morris, played by George Clooney, a man with eyes on the presidency. Paul Giamatti plays a veteran campaign manager for a rival politician. Evan Rachel Wood plays a young intern who gets sucked into the intrigues, and Marisa Tomei plays a hardscrabbling reporter always looking for dirt to dish. In fairness, though her methods may be dubious, she is seeking the truth.

Ides of March, and its characters portray every shade of dark, and you may wonder how something as innocuous as agreeing to meet a rival for a drink in a bar can become such a potential disaster, and how going on a date with an intern when you're single can lead to such complications. Certainly Stephen Myers (Gosling)is left to wonder how minor personal actions can have such potentially dire personal political consequences.

I have to say the story is brilliantly constructed and told, and as you might expect with a political movie, it contains tons of soundbites. We all know that politics can be quite dirty with lowdown tricks and negative campaigning, but I don't think you have seen anything quite like this except in real politics. One persons pain becomes another persons political gain.

I loved the setup and payoff of the opening and closing scenes. As the movie opens Gosling cynically delivers soundbites to camera. The movie closes with soundbites to camera.

Early in the movie he has passion for his work, and says he wouldn't do it if he does not have faith in the candidate. Will he stay true to this when his values are challenged?

I loved the confrontations between Gosling and Hoffman, Giamatti, Tomei, and Clooney in different scenes.

I loved the sexual tension in the early scenes between him and Evan Rachel Wood.

I loved the the contrast in this character who in some way cares, offering an intern in trouble a ride to and from a place, even helping her out of his own pocket, and then making the hardscrabbling choices he makes, as the Darth road beckons, and romantic ideals can disappear faster than a political friendship.

While the movie does not scream surefire Oscar winner it certainly yells, and I think Gosling will get nominated perhaps even win, particularly after being so cruelly overlooked last year for his brilliant turn in Blue Valentine. George Clooney wears three hats as actor, director, and cowriter, and who better to play a smooth politician. Hoffman and Giamatti as usual are brilliant. Either or both could be nominated. In fact you will see few movies with such a strong ensemble this year, with three Oscar winners on board.

I think you will enjoy it, and I hope you found this review helpful.",1323993600,5,3964,4.8533333333333335
4910569,4,B005ZCSP0K,"Despite the exalted cast in this movie, don't be fooled.  it is Ryan Gosling's movie, just like it has been his year in acting in general.  This is both the movie's strength and its weakness.  In order to give him a dilemma, the screenplay picks a rather hackneyed problem which detracts from all this stellar acting.

George Clooney directed it and he has no problem playing the charming, good looking Democratic governor, who is very reminiscent of JFK.  This is all too true of his eye for the ladies as well, which leads into the dilemma at the heart of the movie. Ryan Gosling works for the candidate.  He has a fleeting relationship with a young woman, whom it turns out has had an even more fleeting relationship with the Governor.

While he's involved with the young woman, he also gets caught in the cross fire between two more seasoned political veterans played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giametti.  Both of them play fairly detestable characters.  In fact, the Gosling character is the only one who isn't entrenched in the deep mud of the political world.  This movie is his education about what he's let himself in for by choosing politics as his arena. And it's either get down in the mud and play with these old hands or leave.

Most of the action takes place in Cincinnati Ohio because the Governor is running in the important Ohio primary for President. Everyone does a good job but if this was indeed the plot of the stage play, then I would have liked to seen it made less trite for the screenplay.

4910570,5,B005ZCSP0K,"""The Ides of March"" begins and ends with Ryan Gosling's character, Stephen Meyers, an ambitious thirty-something campaign manager for the Democrats, testing a microphone on an empty stage.  Between the two scenes, he'll have his world view changed considerably.  Although Meyers has logged a lot of miles on the campaign trail, he's surprisingly short on cynicism about the political process.  That's where ""The Ides"" comes in.

George Clooney plays the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential candidate, who's conflicted about accepting the endorsement of a senator (Jeffrey Wright) whom he considers sleazy.  Meanwhile Gosling is being wooed by their opponent's campaign manager (Paul Giamatti), and when he discovers who's behind it, he's in for a shock.  Complicating things even more is a pretty young intern (Evan Rachel Wood), whose relationship with Meyers also reveals that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

While the viewer will probably find the movie's revelations and secrets less shocking than Gosling's character, a consistently excellent effort (and an outstanding one by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Clooney's senior campaign manager) made this enjoyable for me to watch.

Clooney shares screenwriting credit with frequent collaborator Grant Heslov (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Night-and-Good-Luck/dp/B000E1NXJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Night, and Good Luck</a>) and Willimon, and together they provide some insight into the inner workings of the American political system. The movie starts out strong and the dialogue feels quite sharp, but the plot twists turn out to be far less about the subtle intricacies in the current political scene and more about classic Hollywood themes like honor and loyalty. This cautious approach results in a film that is far more conventional in execution than I was hoping it would be based on the trailers.

The story focuses on Stephen Meyers, a young politico who is the junior campaign manager for the charismatic Mike Morris, the governor of Pennsylvania who is looking to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency. Competing against Senator Ted Pullman of Arkansas, Morris is looking to lock down the Ohio primary, but his surest chance for victory ride on getting an endorsement from Senator Thompson of North Carolina, who is pulling out of the election. After a hotly contested debate, Pullman's campaign manager Tom Duffy sets Meyer aside and confidentially asks him to switch camps and work for Pullman. Flattered and understandably paranoid, Meyers keeps this offer a secret from his boss, Morris senior campaign manager Paul Zara. Further complicating matters is Molly Stearns, an intern whom Meyers beds only to find out she had a previous liaison with Morris. She also happens to be the daughter of the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. A fair amount of Machiavellian-level deception and double-crossing among the campaign managers leads to one suicide and Meyers ultimately reconsidering his ideals in pursuit of success and revenge.

The performances are as solid as you would expect. Clooney effortless brings his savvy and charm to Morris in a way that makes you wish Obama could pick up pointers from him. If Paul Giamatti and Philip Seymour Hoffman were anything less than stellar as Duffy and Zara respectively, that would have been far more surprising. What would have been more interesting is if the actors switched roles as they would be playing less to their usual archetypes. Evan Rachel Wood effectively plays the pivotal role of Molly, bringing an intriguing mix of youthful moxie and vulnerability to her character's actions, while Marisa Tomei provides just the right level of cynicism to her New York Times reporter (...will she ever return to starring roles?). Jeffrey Wright is criminally underused in just a few scenes as Thompson, but Max Minghella (the late director Anthony's son) lends sharpness to his minor role as a nakedly ambitious member of the Morris campaign staff. At the center of it all, Ryan Gosling proves he has the gravity to carry a mainstream movie, even one as fully loaded as this one. I only wish the film itself was more surprising and insightful than it was.",1322784000,26,3399,5.33955223880597
4910573,5,B005ZCSP0K,"George Clooney's latest directorial effort The Ides of March, adapted from the stage play Farragut North, takes place entirely within the confines of a campaign to get Democratic governor Mike Morris (played by Clooney himself) the nomination for President of the United States. Clooney, as a known liberal, treads dangerous waters making a political film, guaranteeing that many with opposing political views will have preconceived notions upon entering the theatre. Despite what some may think and what the marketing has led some to believe, The Ides of March is not a political thriller and does not appear to have any political agenda but chooses to use the political arena as a backdrop for the broad spectrum of themes it wishes to explore. It's also a near-perfect movie that ranks as one of the best films of the year.

Ryan Gosling (continuing his 2011 winning streak) plays Stephen Meyers, the idealistic Junior Campaign Manager for Governor Mike Morris. Along with Senior Campaign Manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Stephen is trying to secure a win for Morris in Ohio which will all but guarantee his nomination for President. Stephen is a very driven individual, eager to fight for what he believes in, and by his own admission ""married to the campaign."" The film follows Stephen through the ruthless world of campaigning, as he finds his idealism shaken and faces the fact that he may have to betray his dearly held principles in order to achieve what's most important to him.

The Ides of March is not a flashy political thriller, but an elegant drama driven by characters and theme rather than events. The stage origins of the film are apparent in the way that not much happens in the movie. This is a dialogue-heavy film, filled with political banter, speeches, soliloquies, and declarations. It's carried completely by this dialogue and Clooney's ensemble cast who all get their moment in the spotlight.

Paul Giamatti comes out strong as a rival campaign manager, while Hoffman turns in a cynical, low-key, and quietly powerful performance. Maria Tomei is more ruthless than usual as a reporter who will do anything to get her story. Evan Rachel Wood in the thankless role of a young intern shares smoking, but unnecessary, chemistry with Gosling and adds a bit of soul to the film. The presence of Mike Morris hangs over the entire film, but Clooney stays relegated to the background only to make a strong impression whenever his character is called upon. With all these great performances, it must be said; 2011 is Gosling's year. This is yet another example of Gosling's infinite range, perfectly capturing boyish idealism and motivation only to capture the cynical, pessimistic nature that his character eventually adapts. His performance gets better with every scene and, by the end of it, it's frighteningly good. If the Academy doesn't nominate Gosling for his nearly wordless role in Drive they would be forgiven for nomination his equally deserving, masterful performance here.

The script by Clooney, frequent writing partner Grant Heslov, and Beau Willimon does not attempt to accurately portray what goes on behind the scenes during a political campaign nor does it attempt to avoid sensationalism in portraying morally corrupt politicians. The script is well written enough that its fluid progression and potent dialogue make up for the trivial inconsistencies. About a third of the way through, the film goes in predictable, but intriguing direction some would define as lazy screenwriting, but the film only seems to get better as it moves. 45 minutes in, I thought I was watching a very good movie; 75 minutes in, I realized I may be watching a great one. Clooney is a talented director who knows how to compose a memorable scene and get the most from silence. Three scenes late in the film, one of Hoffman getting into a car and the camera remaining static on that car for a good 20 seconds, a powerful, silent stare between Gosling and Clooney, and that final lingering shot on Gosling are some of the best scenes I've had the privilege to behold this year. This is a very well-made film.

The Ides of March is imperfect enough to keep it from being a major Oscar contender, but the acting and directing will likely be honored. Despite the imperfections I've acknowledged, this is one of the year's best films. In such a tense political climate, the film wisely avoids any agenda that could turn away potential viewers and for a film about liberal Democrats made by liberal Democrats, it's a remarkably fair portrayal of the party. While politics are the backdrop, this is not truly a political film and those without much interest in politics may find something to enjoy and embrace here. This is an enticing example of superb filmmaking and acting.

4910574,3,B005ZCSP0K,"The Ides of March is one of those films where you're left wondering why, given the level of talent that went into making it, you're left feeling like you've seen this movie before, so many times in fact that you can sense every twist and turn long before they finally happen. And that no matter how much the extremely talented cast put into their performances, you've seen those roles before. And given the jaded cynicism that seems to pervade the entire film, leaving everyone tainted, what the point of making the film really was.

To be fair, for someone who might have studiously avoided seeing any of the myriad political campaign dramas that have been made over the last thirty years or so, The Ides of March might well come across as a meaningful and engaging film. For anyone else however, this will be derivative of any number of films, from Mike Nichols' depressingly similar but superior 1998 film Primary Colors with John Travolta, going back to Michael Ritchie's 1972 film The Candidate with Robert Redford, or even further back to Elia Kazan's 1957 classic A Face in the Crowd with Andy Griffith or Robert Rossen's 1948 classic All the King's Men with Broderick Crawford.

The plot, for what it's worth, amounts to this: An idealistic young campaign consultant, Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) is working for the Presidential campaign of a politician he really believes will make a difference, Governor Mike Morris (George Clooney), whose campaign is being managed by ruthless seasoned veteran Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), assisted by a campaign staff that includes pretty young intern Molly Stearns (Evan Rachel Wood). It's a tight race against their opponent for the party nomination, Senator Pullman (Michael Mantell) whose campaign is being managed by the equally ruthless seasoned veteran Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti). Both campaigns are vying for a win in an upcoming state primary and for the uncommitted delegates of a third opponent who has dropped out of the race, either of which could be enough to secure the nomination for their candidate. And covering it all is aggressive reporter Ida Horowicz (Marisa Tomei) who is always looking for any sign of weakness or scandal that will make a good story. But then Meyers suddenly discovers that his idol, Morris, has feet of clay, and that everyone around him is cynical and manipulative, and he ends up becoming the most cynical and manipulative player of them all. Sound familiar? It should. The end.

I have to be honest - given the massive amount of talent behind this film, I was expecting more. Think about it:

George Clooney - Academy award for Best Supporting actor for Syriana, plus three other nominations including one as director for Good Night and Good Luck. Two Golden Globe awards and six nominations. Three Emmy nominations. Four Screen Actors Guild awards and four nominations.

Ryan Gosling, Academy award nominee, two Golden Globe nominations, two Screen Actors Guild nominations.

Philip Seymour Hoffman - Academy award for Best Actor for Capote, plus two other nominations. One Emmy nomination. Golden Globe award plus two nominations. Screen Actors Guild award plus five nominations.

Paul Giamatti - Academy award nominee. Emmy winner for John Adams plus one other nomination. Two Golden Globe awards plus two nominations. Three Screen Actors Guild awards plus one other nomination.

Marisa Tomei - Academy award for Best Supporting Actress for My Cousin Vinny plus two other nominations. Two Golden Globe nominations. Two Screen Actors Guild nominations.

Evan Rachel Wood - Emmy, Golden Glove and Screen Actors Guild nominee.

And yet in spite of all this talent, there's just nothing new here. It's all just a rehash of things we've seen before, leaving the filmgoer with a been-there-done-that at the end. What makes it worse is the pacing. The film spends a tedious hour or so setting things up with characters that are predictable and known almost from the moment you see them, then suddenly lurches into high gear where things are, while still utterly predictable, at least somewhat interesting for about twenty minutes or so. And then suddenly everything just winds down - the idealistic young consultant is now jaded and cynical - and then stops, leaving you wondering what the point of sitting through this was.

Recommended for hardcore fans of George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei or Paul Giamatti who do deliver creditable performances, or for anyone who's looking for an okay political campaign thriller and doesn't mind if it's just a rehash of things they've seen before.",1322697600,2,4613,5.072559366754618
4910575,5,B005ZCSP0K,"This is a very powerful film that does not really call for a long commentary.

We are dealing with the Democratic primaries in Ohio for the presidential election of a year that is not specified, though the various historical elements situate the events after the war in Iraq and yet within a context of hostility against the oil producers in the desert, meaning of course Arab oil producers.

The candidate that is shown as the future winner in this campaign is not the incumbent president, is white and strongly hostile to the use of war as a way to achieve supremacy, though supremacy is the openly expressed aim. The way is is calculating his victory can only be understood in the American context: the great electors have to be elected state by state with rules that are different in the various states. The result then is some kind of in the wings negotiations and communication warfare and it has little to do with democracy and the US Constitution and the fundamental rights of the Bill of Rights.

Calculations, rumors, shady action in the wings, intimidation and even scapegoats when necessary, or even some violence if that's the only way. American politics are dirty, very dirty with such a system, and yet it is so much better than some other political organization. There is little originality in what we can say on this political system.

But there is a lot more to say on three points.

Sexual traps and blackmail: any sexual caper, even hidden deep in the shadow of the night, is one of the favorite weapons used to destabilize and even pull down a candidate. That is immoral in the name of morality. This is mean and absurd, but it is true that unwanted sex is too often the case between the candidate or his major aides and the young volunteers and interns the candidate may use in his team.

The wild and savage war among the various people at the top of a campaign-team. But this is a game in a way in which one will destroy the others if that one can in order to achieve full control over the campaign and a battle of that type is ne ver finished: one may win one fight but the loser may call for a second fight and win in his turn: no one is supposed to be a bad loser and the best loser is the one who concede defeat and walks out without resisting. He will easily get some job somewhere that will pay for his experience and his connections.

The third point that is not even discussed is the desire to bring the USA back to first position by cutting on the consumption of oil drastically and stop buying the oil of the Desert dictatureship that are Moslem at the same time. That is not dictated by any religious beliefs that are rejected from the very start, but only by the ambition to go back to the top and head of the pack of wolves the whole world is identified to.

It is where the film is strangest because in 2010 or 2011 it is difficult to say that the main cause of the decline of the USA is the oil producers. The main opponents in the globalized market are the emerging countries that the latest crisis does not seem to have really jeopardized or endangered, even if it has bothered them slightly. In that perspective it would be interesting to suggest the USA and Americans to stop using any kind of high tech product that is produced in these emerging countries. That would cut the ambition to recapture the leading role in technology short and even very short, a crew cut in a way, which would lead to using the marines sooner or later to bring the emerging countries down.

4910576,5,B005ZCSP0K,"The ""Ides of March"" begins and ends with a closeup of Ryan Gosling's face, as he stands alone on a stage, testing the acoustics for a speech his presidential candidate (George Clooney) is about to give.  Gosling may be barely thirty-years-old, but as the junior campaign manager, he has a lot of experience.  One thing he has yet to acquire a lot of is cynicism about the political machine, but that will happen over the course of ""Ides.""

Clooney plays a Democratic presidential candidate whose staff includes senior campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Friction arises when it's suggested that he accept the endorsement of a senator (Jeffrey Wright) who he considers (irony alert!) sleazy.  Meanwhile Gosling is being wooed by the other side, which gives him a shock when he finds out who's actually behind it.  Also there's a pretty intern (Evan Rachel Wood) who becomes involved with Gosling and whose personal dilemma could have far-reaching effects on the campaign.

I predict that this movie will get at least a few Oscar-nominations.  Like last year's ""The King's Speech,"" it's based on a play, is dialogue-driven and has a stellar cast consisting almost entirely of men.  It drags in places and gets a much-needed boost when certain actors appear on screen.  But unlike TKS,  it's not what you'd call ""uplifting.""  There's no catharsis and no easy victories, even for those who ultimately get what they want.  Like the characters, you're more likely to walk away feeling bemused rather than satisfied.",1320969600,,1527,5.035856573705179
4910577,3,B005ZCSP0K,"There is precious little that is more frustrating than watching a film with a platinum-caliber cast fall short of expectations, but that was exactly my reaction to George Clooney's 2011 smart, engrossing adaptation of Beau Willimon's 2008 play, which in turn, was loosely based on the failed 2004 Democratic primary campaign of Howard Dean. Clooney shares screenwriting credit with frequent collaborator Grant Heslov (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Night-and-Good-Luck/dp/B000E1NXJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Night, and Good Luck</a>) and Willimon, and together they provide some insight into the inner workings of the American political system. The movie starts out strong and the dialogue feels quite sharp, but the plot twists turn out to be far less about the subtle intricacies in the current political scene and more about classic Hollywood themes like honor and loyalty. This cautious approach results in a film that is far more conventional in execution than I was hoping it would be based on the trailers.

Though utterly charming, the candidate is shown to have feet of clay, involved in a dangerous triangle with the other two.

On the Ides of March, Julius Caesar was assassinated; in this Ides of March, we see the death of political idealism.  This is most definitely not a fun date movie or a chick flick; it exposes the immoral underbelly of some political movers and shakers and shows them to be pretty repulsive characters.  There are no heroes here.  The acting was excellent all around, but the story is so grim and the characters so repellent I couldn't wait for it to end.  There were a few very interesting scenes, but a lot of it was quite dull.

4910579,5,B005ZCSP0K,"I saw this movie two weeks ago and am still thinking about it. Liberal Mike Morris, Governor of Pennsylvania,(George Cloney who also directed the film) is running for president and cannot be bought. Or can he? His idealistic press secretary Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling) finds out what politics is all about. Morris' campaign manager is Paul Zara played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Apparently there is no role that Mr. Hoffman cannot play. Paul Giamatti as Tom Duffy is working for Morris' opponent,the candidate from Arkansas. Then there is the obligatory intern played by Evan Rachel Wood. Sound familiar? There are a lot of twists and turns although some of the plot is predictable since unfortunately art in this case imitates life.

I would say the movie is cynical if similar events had not occurred in recent presidential politics. I wonder if a certain ex-senator from North Carolina will see the screening-- or a former president for that matter.
