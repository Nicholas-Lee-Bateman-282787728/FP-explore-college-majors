8578091,5,B00C7CL2XI,"Inspector Morse, then Lewis, and that's the end of that.  Inspector Lynley apparently has gone as far as it's going to.  Midsomer Murder is trying to hang on with Tom Barnaby being replaced by his ""cousin"", but now they've also replaced his sidekick, and the old feeling is fading fast.

While these, and many other Brit murder mystery series,' were being created to show on a weekly basis, we now have had the chance to gulp down entire series' in weekend or weeklong marathons, and it seems we've eaten up almost everything.  Miss Marple, Poirot, Tommy and Tuppence, Rosemary and Thyme...  Speaking for myself, I got greedy each time a series showed up on streaming video series' or came to me in DVD form, each whole series at once, and it seemed there always would be more.  But they're not making them as fast as I'm eating them.

Inspector Lewis, I believe, completely lived up to the Inspector Morse standards, with Hathaway providing an unexpectedly attractive and substantial sidekick to the deservedly-promoted Lewis.  All  of these major British mystery productions have spoiled me rotten.  I don't know what I'll do if there aren't some new ones waiting in the wings, and I don't know how they could live up to my very sharply raised standards (as compared to American fare.)  I love my country, but we just haven't achieved the kind of class the UK has offered in this genre.",1417824000,,1388,4.741666666666666
8578092,5,B00C7CL2XI,"I love the whole Inspector Lewis series and have Seasons 1-6, hence the 5 stars.  I am very grateful to the other reviews who told that season 7 U.K. version was the same as Season 6 U.S. version.  I would have fallen for it!  Thanks.",1409443200,,234,4.155555555555556
8578093,5,B00C7CL2XI,"I have all of the Lewis series up to now series Seven, are there others that have been made? i.e., 8-9 etc??
Do like the English productions and would be keen to purchase more as there isn't much on Aust TV worth watching due to the commercials..ABC has a few programmes but very limited at certain times ..",1402185600,,307,4.310344827586207
8578094,1,B00C7CL2XI,"We like the series and have a DVD player that can play DVDs from other regions, like Great Britain.  Having gone through the US series we were hopeful this was a new set of mysteries.  It was not.  It is the same shows as the US series 6, just numbered differently.",1391644800,8,265,4.1568627450980395
8578095,5,B00C7CL2XI,"Lewis was Chief Inspector Morse's detective sergeant in the wonderful Morse detective series. Morse died, Lewis has been promoted, and carries on in a new tradition. Lawrence Fox is his detective sergeant, and the pair makes a great team. I strongly recommend this.",1387497600,,265,5.186046511627907
8578096,5,B00C7CL2XI,"Firstly potential purchasers need to be aware that this is the UK Series 7 which has the same episodes as Season 6 in North America. Season 6 was released on 6/25/13. Also this is a region 2 DVD so to play it you will need a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player.

Lewis is one of the few `must see' offerings on TV these days so it is so sad that it appears that the seventh series will also be the last. When this series was announced, Laurence Fox (Hathaway) said that there would be no more and stated that both he and Kevin Whately (Lewis) now wanted to pursue other interests. There are just three stories in this series whereas there have normally been four. However, in a break with the previous custom, each is split into two parts.

It is hard to believe that the character of Lewis was introduced in the long running Morse series as long ago as 1986! The chemistry between Morse and Lewis was an obviously significant factor in the success of that series, just as Lewis and Hathaway complement each other in Lewis and the relationship has grown as time has gone on. It is hard to imagine Lewis without Hathaway in the same way that it was hard to imagine Morse without Lewis.

The stories in this series are interesting and well thought out and the plots are quite varied. Down Among the Fearful involves a psychic who has been murdered, in Ramblin' Boy a corpse is discovered which has an interesting background (the corpse not the person) and finally in Intelligent Design, a man is released from prison after serving time for causing death by dangerous driving but it appears that not everyone has forgiven or forgotten his crime. Interesting developments in Lewis' personal life too!

We are up to 27 episodes of Lewis (not quite as many as the 33 Morse managed), and we often watch the earlier ones as they are a joy to revisit. It does rather look as though that is going to be it, and the end of the last episode did have a certain finality about it. However, we can only hope that those involved do have a change of heart.",1375574400,17,2038,4.3978779840848805
8578097,5,B00C7CL2XI,"""Lewis"" was more down to earth and not as philosophical as ""Inspector Morse"" was .
  Overall I liked the series just as much as I did ""Inspector Morse"" .
  As with time all shows reach a ending as ""Inspector Morse"" did and so was the same for ""Lewis"" .
  I will miss ""Lewis"" .
  Now with the new "" Endeavour "" ! A show about how ""Inspector Morse"" started his career back in the 1960's as a young skinny DS Morse to be aired this year .
  I recommend ""Lewis"" as a great follow up to ""Inspector Morse"" and as with ""Inspector Morse"" I have the Complete ""Lewis"" Series series 1-5 ,and 6 and 7 just purchased .
  I like the way British TV drama's do not reveal ( who did the murder ) until the end of the show and keep you guessing .
  The final episode of ""Lewis"" was sad and maybe someday Hathaway will return in his own ""Inspector"" series ?
  ""Lewis"" was just as good as ""Inspector Morse"" but only ran half as long as ""Inspector Morse"" as with most shows on TV today .",1369958400,10,966,4.031746031746032
