3659059,3,B001JP656I,"It may seem politically incorrect now, but then it was funny to everyone including blacks. The actors and plots always made you laugh.",1365465600,,134,4.869565217391305
3659060,5,B001JP656I,I love the old Amos 'Andy movies. a group of us was discussing the movies and we all got together and watched the movie. Very good discussion after revewing the movie.,1363478400,,167,4.419354838709677
3659061,3,B001JP656I,this show had a good history of The Amos and Andy show starting from the radio days.  There were some out takes fromn a few TV shows but I wanted to see more of the TV shows I remember as a kid.,1359158400,,194,3.619047619047619
3659062,5,B001JP656I,This was an excellent show depicting the reasons why Amos 'N' Andy was taken off the air.  However with these shows available all over the internet I'd like to see a set made from the masters or first generation copies.  They do exist because if you watch this documentary you will see perfect video and audio quality.  Someone has these and they should be put out for all to see.,1353456000,,380,4.4
3659063,4,B001JP656I,This is the only video review of this program and it is good to have a copy as a unique reference item with interviews of the original cast..,1352764800,,141,4.071428571428571
3659064,4,B001JP656I,I had a copy of this program on VHS and had even burned it to a DVD. The content is really good and makes you think about the old Amos and Andy program. This is not the show but a documentary about the show and I found it very interesting. I wish they could have made a higher quality copy. The DVD I made was from a VHS I used to record it off the air. The quality of this one is a little better but with todays technology I would have expected them to make it better. I don't think it will have a wide audience so I suppose it is all I could expect. In any event I am happy to have the content as it is better than what I had.,1329436800,4,628,3.6940298507462686
3659065,5,B001JP656I,"This is an excellent documentary of the A&A show. The late (and sadly forgotten) comedian George Kirby examines and comments on the series from it's inception by creators Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll on radio, through the ill-fated 1930 film ""Check & Double Check"" (showing all that's worthwhile from the film) as well as the A&A cartoon ""The Lion Tamer,"" and concluding with the 1950s TV show and the resulting controversy.

A good selection of clips, as well as a near-complete episode ""Kingfish Sells a Lot"" is incuded in regard to the TV show. There are also interviews with the (then) surviving cast members. Surprisingly, Jesse Jackson appears with some positive commentary on the show, admitting that he enjoyed the program as a child. Redd Foxx warmly recalls his friendship with Tim Moore, the beloved ""King Fish"" of the show, as well as some interestng points made by Marla ""Florence"" Gibbs. Bascially, much of this commentary rebuts the black bourgeoise outrage over the show in the 1950s. Not stated is the real reason for this controversy; the fear among the rising Black middle class that this show would case them not to be taken seriously in the ""white world."" Thus, the show was bad for business.

Either way, this DVD is a good way to laugh and learn something at the same time.",1279584000,22,1302,4.834080717488789
3659066,3,B001JP656I,Allowed me to view a typical episode without the need to purchase the entire series. Overview from George Kirby added insight. No need for other actor comments including original cast members.,1255305600,3,192,5.225806451612903

3659069,5,B001JP656I,"I loved the Amos and Andy show that show , Baby Snooks , big John and Sparky , Shelly Fabres and Andy Griffith formed my personality I don't think I knew what prejudice was until the Networks caved to the NAACP and took my favorite show off the air. An all black cast of excellent actors portraying judges, doctors and Lawyers and people thought it was degrading !!! It took another fifty years for blacks to get any semblance of the respect that show was earning for them",1442448000,,472,4.375

3659075,5,B001JP656I,"This was one of my favorite shows which our family listened to on the radio and later watched on television.  It was an all black cast, but there was nothing racial about it.  It was just funny sitcom with great actors.",1397433600,,219,4.317073170731708
3659076,4,B001JP656I,A great reminder of a fine and very funny TV show which helped shape countless successful comedy series.  Wish it were still in syndication!,1371686400,,140,4.833333333333333
8313347,5,B001JP656I,"Host/narrator George Kirby talks about AMOS AND ANDY, its history, introduces one full episode, numerous clips and several interviews.  Kirby says that he is tryng to present a balanced view, but this program is overwhelmingly favorable to AMOS AND ANDY.  The opinions seem to be that it was a pioneering black program with great actors, actually, THE pioneering Black TV program.  And it was funny.",1525824000,,399,5.107692307692307

8313349,5,B001JP656I,"I've always wondered WHY this show went off the air and why it was impossible to find tapes or DVDs of it.  Now I know.  I agree completely with the opinion shown here--that it was a wonderful show and wrongly taken off the air by the power of one single organization, the NAACP.  What a great loss!!",1520899200,,300,4.228070175438597

8313352,5,B001JP656I,"This series was hilarious. Why the NAACP would object to seeing such great talent that was displayed by an incredible cast of seasoned professional actors is beyond me. The argument that this series dishonors the African-American culture is ludicrous. Particularly when the creators obviously went to great lengths to show all of the African-American experience. In addition to King Fish and Andy who provided the comedy, the other main character Amos, played by Alvin Childress, was the straight man. He was intelligent, as was his wife, and he owned his own cab company. Furthermore, the show was filled with African-American doctors, lawyers and businessmen. NAACP, SMH?",1484784000,3,673,5.3584905660377355
