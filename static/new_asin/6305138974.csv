7884101,4,6305138974,"If you're reading this, you're not only a DOCTOR WHO fan but probably one of Tom Baker, the fourth, and most peoples' estimation, the best of all the men to play the renegade Time Lord. I know I am, and I know my favorite period of Baker's seven-year turn as The Doctor encompassed the years 1974 - 1977. During much of that time, Elisabeth Sladen was his principal companion (playing the plucky journalist Sarah Jane Smith) and Philip Hinchcliffe was the show's chief producer/showrunner. Hinchcliffe favored a style of storytelling very much rooted in horror. Together, the three -- Baker, Sladen and Hinchcliffe -- made not only superb television, but a uniquely lively period of DOCTOR WHO. It is therefore a little ironic that ""K-9 & Company"" was produced by Johnathan Nathan-Turner, who is synonymous with overseeing the decline of WHO until its eventual cancellation in 1989, because this production, intended to be the pilot of a spinoff series that never happened, has both the look and the feel of the best days of Hinchliffe's reign. Even the absence of Tom Baker (or any Doctor) can't hamper the sheer enjoyment it brings.

""K-9 & Company"" (the actual episode is called ""A Girl's Best Friend"") finds us in England at the end of the year 1981. Having ended her days as the Doctor's companion, Sarah Jane Smith (Sladen) has resumed her career as a freelance journalist, but is taking the holidays at her aunt's rather stately manor in the English countryside. Unfortunately her aunt seems to have vanished when Sarah arrives, leaving her in charge of her teenage nephew, just released from school for Christmas. Not long after her arrival, Sarah finds a box addressed to her with a note from the Doctor: within the box is a version of the feisty robotic dog K-9 (who joined the show after Sarah left as one of his companions). As she digests this welcome surprise, however, her inability to locate her aunt, plus a series of bizarre incidents among her aunt's rather clannish and secretive neighbors kindle Sarah's seldom-dormant journalistic instincts. Before you can say, ""Doctor!"" she's up to her neck in a mystery involving witchcraft, human sacrifices and a conspiracy that may, or may not, involve everyone in town. Can Sarah navigate all this deceit, menace and occultic skullduggery sans her Time Lord, with ""only"" K-9 for company?

As I said before, this show/episode did what I thought impossible for the time period/showrunner in question. It recaptured the atmosphere of DOCTOR WHO at its height -- when many episodes were shot ""on Earth,"" when much of the shooting was done on location or in lavish-looking BBC sets, and when the storylines tended toward a blend of sci-fi and Hammer-style horror. The lack of Tom Baker does not much hinder Elisabeth Sladen, and oddly enough, she interacts with John Leeson's K-9 as if she'd been doing it for years. I was also delighted by the presence of Colin Jeavons (who played Inspector Lestrade in the superb Grenade TV ""Sherlock Holmes"" series back in the 80s-90s) and Sean Chapman (of ""Hellraiser"" fame), who play father-son members of the cult.

On the downside, I would point out the following: the opening credit sequence and its music are horrifically bad, there are too many characters to follow easily, and -- this is linked to the surfeit of characters -- the running time of one hour is insufficient to work through all the suspects and complexities of the plot. The average DOCTOR WHO episode was about 90 minutes, and this one would have benefitted enormously from a fleshed-out final act. Also, there are moments when Sarah's normal smart-alleck personality escalates to snarky bitchiness. Beyond that there's not much to criticize. At a time (1981 - 1982) when its parent show was beginning to show signs of the creative exhaustion and punch-drunk silliness that marred its final years on the air, ""K-9 & Company"" took me back (in time!) to a happier era when casting, writing, acting, production and direction were all self-assured and satisfying. While Sladen went on in later years to star in another Sarah Jane series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, I can't help but regret the the decision not to move forward with this one. Somehow, director John Black, producer Nathan-Turner and writer Terence Dudley managed to do the Doctor better than the actual DOCTOR of the time; and with no Doctor in sight!",1512086400,,4379,4.922868741542625

Anyways, I defiantly recommend this to any Whovian and fan of Sarah and K9.

7884105,5,6305138974,"I BARELY REMEMBER SEEING THIS SHOW ON WVPBS AS A KID.  I ALWAYS LOVED K-9.  I REALLY WISH THEY HAD MADE THIS INTO A SERIES.  THEY BRING SARAH JANE SMITH (ELIZABETH SLADEN) AND K-9(JOHN LEESON) BACK IN THE SECOND SEASON OF THE NEW DOCTOR WHO SERIES.  I REALLY HOPE THIS COMES TO DVD SOMEDAY, BUT SOMEHOW I HAVE A FEELING IT WILL BE A LOT OF YEARS BEFORE THAT IS DONE.  THEY ARE TAKING TO LONG TO PUT THE SHOWS ON DVD.  IT HAS A GREAT PLOT AND HAS A SIMILAR STORY LINE TO ONE OF THE KEY TO TIME STORIES DURING THE TOM BAKER ERA.",1180224000,,526,3.9150943396226414
7884106,3,6305138974,"The first Doctor Who spinoff debuted inbetween the departure of Tom Baker and the debut of Peter Davison as the Doctor.
The story:  Sarah Jane Smith, former companion of the Fourth Doctor, has arrived in the village of Moreton Harwood to pay a Christmas visit to her aunt, Lavinia Smith, who is on a lecture tour in the US, but leaves suddenly without a word.  She arrives at her aunt's house, where she discovers a packing crate, and inside, a gift from the Doctor, K-9 Mark III, a duplicate of the robot dog whose fellow counterparts accompanied the Doctor.  Sarah also looks after Brendan Richards, Lavinia's teenaged ward, who's on break from school.
Sarah discovers through the various villagers that there are some people who still believe in the black arts to make their crops grow, and that her aunt, a rational scientist, upset many of them by publishing an article on witchcraft.  So her plans to write a book are interrupted when two of the locals attack Brendan, who is later kidnapped.  Only her robot dog can save the day.
The quick cuts of Elizabeth Sladen, be it profile or in different outfits, and the music, is styled after American TV programmes like Magnum PI.  And she comes off well reprising her 1974-76 role as Sarah Jane, a role she would repeat in The Five Doctors (1983) and Downtime (1995).
The programme also pushes knowledge of computer architecture, as the knowledgeable Brendan refers to K-9's logic gates, integrated memory, buses, and heuristic interfaces.  I should know, I had to learn that stuff back at NMSU and thank goodness I'm out of it.  Still, it's nice to see it referred from an ex-CS major's point of view.
Bill Fraser plays Commander Pollock, Lavinia's neighbour and partner in her market garden business, and he does so with a gruff but sensible old gentlemanly charm.  Ian Sears does reasonably well as Brendan.  And yes, John Leeson does the voice of K-9 like he did in the Doctor Who series.
Originally intended as a pilot to a Doctor Who spinoff series starring Elizabeth Sladen and K-9, it aired on 28 December 1981, netting 8.4 million viewers, and would've garnered more had a transmitter in the North West region not suffered a power blackout.  The reason why a full series wasn't pursued was changes in BBC management.  Also, it's dwelling on the occult was a debit, as there was a censorship group in England that was quite sensitive about that.
Standing on its own, nothing on par with the Doctor Who stories, but it's good to see Elizabeth Sladen and K9 interract without the Doctor in the story.",1072396800,12,2558,4.736486486486487
7884107,2,6305138974,"The only good thing I have to say about this video is that as the only Dr. Who spin-off, it does have some nostalga value. Other than that I found it trite and not very well executed. K-9 is supposed to the the star (at least that's what the title leads us too belive) and apart from his usual vulcan-esquse logical statements all he does is blast a few people. I love Dr. Who and I like K-9, but that's all there is to like about this video.",1001376000,,442,4.034090909090909
7884108,4,6305138974,"To give Doctor Who a bit more publicity, The writer of many story's, Terrance Dudly, created this story.
After being left on Earth by the Doctor, Sarah-Jane Slowly manouvers back into her life as a Jouranlist.  Having time up her sleeve, she decides to go to her Aunt Lavinia's home in  Moreton Harwood, to write a book, only to find that she has gone to  America.
Arriving at her Aunt's house, she meets her Aunt's ward ,  Brendan, and a whole town of weirdo's, including a Rather talkative Post  office attendant, A grumpy old Retired Navy Commander, A Couple Of people  who seem out of the ordinary, and A Father and son team who take everything  Just a little too far.
When she arrives in the house, she finds the place  riddled with books and papers of the occult and witch craft, and a box,  from the Doctor, in the middle of the room. Inside the Box is K-9
After  Brendan is Kidnapped by a cult of Wictches, Sarah and K-9 begin to  investigate the townies and finds that Brendan is to be savraficed to the  Goddess Hecatae at the Winter Solstice.
In this 50min Story, the people  you least expect to be in the cult are the leaders and the people you  believe would have started the cult are infact, the innocent.
Considering  that there is no Doctor, it is a rather interesting plot. Slightly better  acting in this than in UNIT Story's, and for those Keen on Sarah-Jane, Is a  must see.",948153600,10,1394,4.425196850393701
