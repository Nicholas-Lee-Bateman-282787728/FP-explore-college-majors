1533356,5,B00005JN7R,"I think I'll have trouble improving on the other reviewers here, especially ""Rustifer"" (hilarious), since I have not really seen the series since it was last on ABC-TV in the sixties.

But certain things stand out in my mind, mainly the tiki-drenched atmosphere of the show and Miss Stevens wonderful songs in the shell bar (the best part). I remember one episode where she sang ""Devil in the Deep Blue Sea.""

My touchstone over the years has been my old scratchy LP of ""Hawaiian Eye,"" which was finally released on CD in May of 'O6 (Collectables COL-CD-7779. I'm sure Amazon would have it by now). In it you can hear a fine rendition of ""Let's Do It"" by Connie Stevens as well as other enjoyable numbers by Robert Conrad and Poncie Ponce. I even liked the phrase ""...to grace the nation's cathodes"" in the liner notes. On CD the album sounds better than ever!

I hope Time-Warner will reissue all the episodes on DVD, but going beyond that, I sometimes daydream that someone will do a classy (high budget, high production values) movie or remake the TV show in modern high definition. This is one black-and-white show that always should have been in color.

By the way, do you suppose Connie Stevens could still sing like that if we asked her?",1155772800,54,1244,4.615384615384615
1533357,4,B00005JN7R,"This series is a baby boomer must. It was the only really successful detective spin-off of the 77 Sunset Strip phenomena in that it lasted more than just a couple of years (Oct. '59-Apr.'63). The original two leads, Robert Conrad and Anthony Eisley, were molded from the ultra-cool Bailey & Spenser genre that worked so well on the Sunset Strip--replete with mandatory sidekicks, babes, booze and bad guys.

I have collected many of the episodes from various classic tv video resources and can confess that the plot lines are all pretty simple, the sets are vintage backlot Warner studios (many ""locations"" are duplicated in Surfside 6 and 77 Sunset Strip episodes)and only stock film and backdrops were actually Hawaiian-generated. On rare days only did the film crew venture out to an actual location off the WB lot. Fortunately, L.A. also had palm trees and beaches. Yet the snappy theme song and tiki-soaked opening credits always duped one into thinking Waikiki was just around the corner. The opening credit scenes of Conrad, Eisley and Connie Stevens actually surfing a wave in unison is just awe-inspiring. It must have required a hundred takes minimum to pull off that shot.

You could always tell which car company was sponsoring one of these Warner classics. The 77 Sunset Strip guys all drove Ford convertibles, the Surfside 6 hunks buzzed around in Pontiacs, and the Hawaiian Eyes all drove massively chrome-laden Oldsmobiles (with car radio phones!). Nary a BMW in the lot. If you're lucky enough to have some of the episodes that didn't edit out the original commercials, you can stare in amazement at hip people smoking Old Golds and Winstons or waxing down their hair with ""little"" dabs of Brylcreem.

The show is set at the Hawaiian Hilton Village, which still exists today. The Shell Bar, where pixie Cricket Blake warbled reverb-enhanced pre-recorded tunes to moon-struck audiences, is still around albeit many times renovated since (the bamboo tables have been replaced). The detectives operated from a way-too-cool office off of the hotel lounge that had its own swimming pool and eternally-lit tiki lamps. One can understand why they beat feet to the office every day. Unfortunately, the series began an early decline once Eisley left for what he thought would be a burgeoning movie career, and certainly ""jumped the shark"" in its last year when the ever-available Troy Donahue joined the cast as the hotel's social director. The writing became a little stretched in order to justify this rather unexplainable addition.

There's been enough buzz directed towards Warner Bros. for them to consider releasing these classic detective series on DVD. I haven't seen any release dates yet, but I guess they're coming soon. It figures, now that I've spent untold dollars collecting so many episdoes with varying degrees of quality and editing. I suggest you snap up a disk as soon as it becomes available, then settle back in your easy chair with a straight-up martini and a smoke and lose yourself in about 55 minutes an epidode's worth of pure hip private eye fluff ala early '60's Hollywood.",1148428800,148,3110,5.021317829457364
1533358,5,B00005JN7R,"This one was on last night and Connie was great in it.  She sings ""Am I In Love?"" at The Shell Club.  She gets kidnapped and has a few action scenes, as does Robert Conrad.  The take he does when he falls in pursuit of the crook is priceless!  The sets, cars, costumes and art direction are fabulous in this show!  Please release it on DVD.  Suggested extras:  commentary by Robert Conrad & Connie Stevens.  A tiki bar option with cocktail lounge organ songs and 60's surf and bossa nova tunes.",1139875200,36,494,4.351648351648351

1533668,5,B00005JN7R,"Hawaiian Eye

I'm only guessing this one deserves 5 stars because its been almost half a century since I last saw it. I do seem to recall as a young pup playing the super smooth detectives played by Conrad and Eisley and later Troy the Boy, lusting over a very cute Connie Stevens and Poncing about the surf with P.P. But despite the appeals of so many, especially you baby boomers, craving for such simple charms of our youth, the producers in their wisdom continue to resist releasing them to DVD.

I would make one signficant point however to those holding the closed candy jar. This is a series that appeals for its nostalgic value. It hardly compares with the production values of later Hawaiian items of the genre, Hawaii 50 and Magnum P.I. and is unlikely to appeal to many younger than 50 years of age. This is memory lane fodder for us senior citizens and I would suggest that the market for such pearls will diminish year by year as our sight and hearing wanes and our numbers drop off.

Now is the time to release these treasures while you can still make a profit Warner Bros. That goes for other little gems you've got hidden in your vaults from yesteryear. Leave it much longer and you'll not have a market and will have missed the boat to the Sandwich Islands and a tidy little windfall from the only significant audience these shows still have.

Be a little compassionate to us oldies...and might I add sensible for your investors and make a profit along the way. I'm sure we'll enjoy every last morsel of this gem...if our teeth are up to it and you'll have a little extra padding in your pocket ( I've always maintained that if all else fails appeal to their greed and avarice).",1289952000,8,1695,4.475728155339806
1533669,2,B00005JN7R,"Seems many people are talking about Hawaiian Eye and when they may see a proper remake. Well have been a Hawaiian Eye fan since a young chap watching the series on TV in Australia all those years ago. Finally purchased the full series (from the US) which turned up and it was great to see them again. However, after the first few disks the image quality (and audio) started to deteriorate with images getting very blotchy, sometimes it was hard to even tell who was who. The DVD's are black and white and some of the disks seem to be third gen recordings with contrast and brightness problems. Audio was also compromised. Some problems with last series as they seem to have been done in colour - this has caused even more problems with recording to DVD in B&W when more than one gen of recording used. I guess you get what you pay for - without original film to take images from to digitise one is always going to end up with second rate images. Note that this was not purchased from Amazon - I hope that Warner Bros do find the time and money to do the series properly. Retro shows are obviously a huge market and I am sure most makers of those 60/70 blockbusters will be cashing in on them if possible. I am very impressed with the Route 66 series - (purchased from Amazon!) - image quality is good as is audio. I hope that Hawaiian Eye will eventually be done as it should - clear and crisp images, good sound and a trip back to the 60's for all of us.",1284249600,11,1455,4.256317689530686
1533670,4,B00005JN7R,"Hawaiian Eye was one of the set of sexy Warner Brothers PI shows of the late 50s and early 60s. Along with the legendary 77 Sunset Strip, Bourbon Street Beat, and Surfside 6.

Hawaiian Eye notably featured TVs first substantial look at Robert Conrad, who of course became a TV series staple with shows such as Wild, Wild West, and Blacksheep Squadron (aka Baa Baa Black Sheep).

A young and beautiful Connie Stevens is also in evidence, with an entertaining song number almost every show, and an occasional involvement in a case.

Anthony Eisley was suave and confident as the senior partner. Unfortunately this would be Eisley's best role, as after this show he basically was limited to guest star slots on other series.

The stories are often somewhat simplistic, often involving solving a dangerous problem more than solving a deep mystery. However, all the actors are engaging and interesting, and anyone with a yen for TV nostalgia will enjoy them.",1277510400,3,953,4.900621118012422

I doubt that this series could be remade now with new actors. It's hard enough to find actors with genuine charisma and 'cool' these days, let alone several of them that would contrast and complement each other so well. Plus the musical tones of ""Cricket"".

Warner Archives has been doing a great job of releasing some of their vintage TV series (see my review of The Liuetenant 1963-64 drama - another great series recently released by Warner).
Hawaiian Eye has style (if you like the way the folks on MadMen dress just wait until you see the original styles of that era...on Hawaiian Eye). The dapper Anthony Eisley plays Tracey Steele, head of the Hawiian Eye detective agency. Robert Conrad plays Tom Lopaka the hot headed detective partner of the agency. Kazio Kim plays Poncie Ponce a local Hawaiian cab driver with his ear to the ground to help out his detective friends and Connie Stevens plays the sexy Cricket Blake receptionist at the detective agency who also sings (quite well) at the Hawaiian Village hotel and night club (the hotel is real it was built by Henry J. Kaiser in 1958 and became the Hilton
Hawaiian Village in the 1970s). This series was
a success with TV audiences as Hawaii had just received US statehood in 1959 and audiences were able to get a glimpse of the lush tropical island when tuning in to watch Hawaiian Eye. The acting is very good, the scripts are interesting and it's easy to fall in love with the promise of adventure on an exotic island. Hawaiian Eye delivers.
