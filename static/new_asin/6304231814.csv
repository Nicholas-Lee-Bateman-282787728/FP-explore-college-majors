815172,5,6304231814,"My toddler loves this video because she adores dogs and music.  This video combines both with fun dog action and cheerful familiar songs.  This movie has no animation, which is good for my daughter because so far, at least,  she prefers real-life characters. There's a great sequence (that appeals to  kids and adults alike)of clips of ""stupid dog tricks"" from old  movies. A light story line ties the whole movie together. The child actors  are sometimes a little too staged but that's Hollywood!",944352000,,497,4.927710843373494
7865631,5,6304231814,"I have a 16 year old daughter who loved this. Her ten year old brother loved it. We have a new toddler who requests it by name as the ""Dog Dog Movie."" It is goofy, it is kitschy, but the point is - the intended audience LOVES it. I would recommend this movie to anyone with toddlers who love dogs and dancing/singing kids.",1376870400,,322,4.126984126984127

Thanks for the great service and price.

7865633,5,6304231814,"My son was addicted to this video before he could talk.  He would ask for it by saying woof woof and pointing at the TV.  I enjoyed watching it too.  It has amusing, heartwarming and catchy songs.  The dancing is great and the variety of dogs shown is cute.",1252800000,,257,4.183673469387755
7865634,5,6304231814,"My daycare provider has used this tape in her home for years.  When she puts the movie on, the children literally go crazy w/ joy and excitement, as they love this movie.  They jump up and down with excitement and request to see the movie repeatedly.  All of the parents ordered tapes just to have them at home, because it's such a great movie. Very fun, educational and enjoyable for the kids.  Not violent at all, a good buy for sure.  My daughter is 2 yrs old and it's her favorite tape in the world.",1131667200,,503,4.252631578947368
7865635,3,6304231814,"For younger kids that this Disney Sing Along Songs video is aimed at, I thoroughly recommend it. They get to see Dalmation dogs and sing along to classic children's songs. Adults can feel free to watch it with their kids or let their kids watch it by themselves. Either way, fun to be had.",1123804800,,289,4.37037037037037
7865636,5,6304231814,"This video contains 5 big LOVES of a toddler : Music, real life children, dancing, animals & balls. My 1.5yr old daughter who hardly spends time watching TV will not take her eyes off this video.

The length of the video is also good - half an hour - not too long.

She has learnt to sing, dance and bark (like a dog) from this video.

Only downside is that this video should really be converted to a DVD format. This can reduce rewinding and increase durability of media.",1122422400,,472,4.280898876404494
7865637,5,6304231814,"My girls love this video as well as all the Disney Sing Alongs (we own ALL of them). They tend to prefer these with the actual characters and kids (beach party, disneyland fun, campout, circus 101 dalmations) than the cartoons - but still love them all!",1063670400,,253,4.521739130434782
7865638,5,6304231814,"My daughter loved this tape since she was 18 months old. By the time she turned five, she only watched it once a month or so, but in the old days we used to watch it 2-3 times a day.

Needless to say, we wore out one copy and had to buy another.

Unfortunately, the other Disney Sing Along Songs videos are not nearly in this tape's league. ...But this one is just a bunch of dogs and kids having a party, singing songs, and having fun. Very well done.",1045094400,,452,4.011111111111111
7865639,5,6304231814,Great 30 min. video. Neighborhood children come with their dogs to a dog birthday party at Pongo and Perditta's house. Pongo and perdita are dalmation parents of some very cute Dalmation puppies. Not all the dogs in the show are Dalmations. The Childrens dogs are different breeds and They tell you in the show what kind of dogs they are. There is lots of singing in the show and  dogs doing some really good dog tricks. I would recommend this to any dog lover or animal lover. Probably good for ages 2 to 8. Although my older children will still watch it. I even find my self enjoying watching it.,1029715200,,598,4.4363636363636365
