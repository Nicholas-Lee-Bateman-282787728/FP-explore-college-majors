915529,4,6304680236,"""The Crawling Eye"" (actually titled ""The Trollenberg Terror"") is one of the 1950s horror movies that is difficult for me to rate. The acting is very good by Forrest Tucker, Janet Munro, and the rest of the cast. The suspense and terror were good, but the story dragged somewhat as I kept wondering when the monster was going to show its ugly eyeball. Eventually it did (as did several others). As with many horror movies of the 1950s, the special effects were of the low-budget variety (including painted landscapes, the falling dummy, and the monsters), but that was the 50s. I did have  one concern and that was- why did the monsters have an obsession with people's heads??  I gave at least a half-star for the eye (no pun intended) candy of Jennifer Jayne and her rather revealing bend-forward scenes, which I probably didn't notice when I was a kid watching this many years ago.",1449273600,,882,4.683870967741935

915576,5,6304680236,"The Original EYEBALL Film!

Eyes scare the bejeesus out of me.  I saw this film when I was a kid back in New York during the late 1950's.  It was on MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE for a week - in the early afternoon. Was at a friend's house when I saw it for the ""third"" time. By the end of this film, I was outside looking up to see if the EYE was following me. In fact, I couldn't watch it again for 10 years, that's how it affected me.  But now I am an adult, it's not so bad.  But it was scary, tense and a good story.  What I found out was that SOUNDS really creeped me out. Not only ""sounds"" but music and dialogue never left my memory of this film.  Another ""eyeball"" film, THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE(1945) is worse than this film. It all comes down to a good story, director and actors - F. Tucker and Janet Munro were very good, the actor who played ""Brett"" was over the top, but it was the script by Jimmy Sangster that kept you going and kept your interest.

915687,4,6304680236,"(I have to smile while writing this 'review'.)

I first saw this show while a kid growing up in central Texas in the 1960s. It was one of those movies that the local TV stations would show late Saturday afternoons (how they got a made-in-the-UK movie back then I don't know).

You're probably only going to like this movie if you, like me, saw it as a kid. The special effects are really 'cheesy' but they only served to get me laughing.

I was pleased to find that the film used to make the DVD was in pretty good condition. Picture quality is good and the sound is OK. (something that I would not have noticed on our old black-and-white TV in the 1960s is that on this transfer you can tell that matte paintings are used for the mountain scenes)

The U.S. title (not used with its UK release) pretty much says it all.

(To show you how times have changed .... the British board of censors rated this movie as not suitable for kids less than 16 years old.)",1426636800,,957,4.265193370165746

movie. The american name given to this movie, actually, there were several,  The Crawling Eye, The Creeping Eye, The Flying
Eye, and the Creature from Another World. Well, I was surprised to learn that movies could have several titles. Returning to the
dvd movie, The Crawling Eye, I really enjoyed it more today, 10/09/14, I think, than in 1958. It is one of the 1950's Classic

915966,3,6304680236,"This film starts off well spending time to let the viewers get to know the characters, but in the last 20 minutes it descends to cheap special effects to show the crawling brains with tentacles. There is no attempt to communicate with them, even when there are numerous scientists in the cast. Nowhere in the film itself is it called The Crawling Eye. It is The Trollenberg Terror on the screen. I would say that I like most of the film until the final attack on the observatory, then its cheapness reveals itself. The monsters don't look real and there is no attempt to find what they want. Also the character Alan Brooks is not defined. What is his job? A government agent? I noticed also that the action is performed in front of painted scenes and is not filmed outdoors--I suspect virtually every scene is on a set. Finally the role of Ann Pilgrim is not developed enough. She has psychic powers but she uses them to communicate or fight off the aliens. She is a helpless empty vessel receiving messages. Today a director could not get away with that. The defenders would have used her powers to try to find out more about the aliens, thus a two way telepathic communication. The possession of frozen corpses behaving (almost) like real people is a nice touch, much better than shambling zombies.  The movie is o.k., but not great.

I will say deadly creature, scientist who works to solve problem, that much you can get from the package. Like I said, it was decent. Would I buy it again, in a heartbeat.

For this reason alone you should buy this film. However, intelligent 1950s sci-fi and the sheer fun of crawling eye monsters is an even better reason.
Like the Hammer Quatermass films this one was also based on a teleplay, THE TROLLENBERG TERROR, the European release title for the film. Hammer regular Jimmy Sangster wrote the screenplay.
Forrest Tucker is the obligatory American star, much like Brian Donlevy in the Quatermass set, who investigates aliens living in a cloud high upon a mountain in Trollenberg in the Swiss Alps. Lots of chilling scenes, bizarre, gruesome deaths and suspenseful moments here as psychic Janet Munro becomes the target of the crawling eye aliens and their undead assassins.
Certainly one of the best of the genre, offering top-notch entertainment with an intelligent premise. A keeper for any serious collection of 50s sci-fi.",1391299200,3,1059,5.162790697674419

Starring the late Forrest Tucker, it has a certain strangeness that differs a lot from typical drive-in theater B movie fare seen here in the U.S. It's black and white and it's low budget, but the special effects are pretty neat considering the time period the movie was made in. It's a British film, with a good hard sci-fi plot, and there are a few shots where the camera is not so subtle in it's focus on wiggly cleavage. This added to the fun for us.

916111,4,6304680236,"I would actually rate this 3.5 stars.

I purchased this film a few years ago because a relative of mine stars in it - Forrest Tucker. He was my moms cousin. I barely remember him as as I only met him a few times and only one of them I really remember. About 1980 he was in a play at Starlight Musicals (an outside covered stage that has since been torn down) on Butler University's campus. I took my now wife to see it as we are Pharmacy grads from Butler.  The title was Ballroom Dance (If I remember correctly). I didn't tell her that Forrest was related to me until it was over and we visited him back stage. I wasn't 100% sure he would remember me but he did (or at least acted like it) which really impressed my wife-to-be. My mom even told me that he called her while in Indianpolis to go to lunch with him and he mentioned me going back stage to see him.

But back to this movie - considering they had about $1.92 to spend on this movie it's pretty good. The main downfall is the actual monsters as they just look fake. The acting is good as is the direction. Cineatography is pretty good as well. Picture was pretty good and sound was fairly good as well. Plot was fairly tight. Lighting and the fog effects were properly handled.

Is this a great picture? No - but considering everything it is a decent to almost good one.

My mom has told me that this was one of the pictures that Forrest talked about when he would attend the Barker Christmas parties we used to have at the Lyons Club in good ole Westfield, IN. He was, according to her, kind of excited about it as it was a role outside of what he was usually offered. I barely remember meeting him before this but do remember being told to call him 'uncle' Forrest. He was pretty big guy so I do remember making the connection between Forrest and being big (like a tree!).

The movie came quickly in perfect shape. I would rate this a 7.5 to 8.0 out of 10. This was for the VHS version.",1371945600,,1949,4.170212765957447

Unlike most modern Monster movies, this one doesn't rely on extreme blood and guts gore. Rather, it keeps you in suspense about what the monsters look like for as long as possible. By today's standards, they aren't that scary. But just imagine how you would feel if you saw one of these FOR REAL on the roof of your own house! Bet you would consider it scary then!
  Nowadays, I still enjoy this movie just because I love monster movies, and this is a classic.
  This is a very clean transfer. It doesn't look like a bad VHS to DVD dub, like so many I've seen in the past. There are very few glitches, (If any. I didn't notice any in the two copies that I have.) Video and audio are very good quality. If you enjoy old style Monster Movies like Godzilla, King Kong, etcetera, you will like this one.

The title monster was creepy.  The eye itself was realistic, obviously the eye of a stuntman who was on the set at the time.  That's a wild guess; I really don't know for sure.  The special effects people could have done a better job operating the tentacles of the monster to make them more animated.

The movie begins as a mystery, why are so many climbers disappearing or dying on this mountain.  In short order, they soon discover why, and then the problem is how to stop it.
I liked that they kept the reveal of the creatures until late in the film, because they are a bit ridiculous.  I also like that this film was shot in black and white, to great effect.

916180,4,6304680236,"I first saw ""The Crawling Eye"" in the Gem Theater in Riverton, Wyoming as part of a double feature when I was at an impressionable age and never quite forgot it. I saw the first half of it again at two in the morning on television twenty years later and was amazed at what a foreboding tone the movie had and how much was being done with so little but had to work that morning and decided it wouldn't be a good idea to go to work with only a few hours sleep and skipped the last half. When it became apparent that I would have to pick out my own anniversary gift this year and that the gift would have to be cheap, I decided to yield to a nostalgia factor and decided to buy the widescreen European version of the film, which is the original version as it was released in England under the title ""The Trollenburg Terror."" I don't regret the purchase because I enjoyed watching the film again and will probably watch it once or twice a year in the future. However, I have to report that by whatever name you want to use, this vigorous little B movie could have been a minor masterpiece (probably very minor) but is seriously marred by the level of special effects in the last third of the movie. The aliens turn out to be very poorly designed and manipulated and would cause bellylaughs if shown to a contemporary movie audience. The effect is like sipping a good Irish whiskey and having someone come by and adding diet pepsi when you don't expect it.

 Despite the let down of the special effects toward the end, I still recommend the movie, especially to those who remember seeing it in a theater when they were young. After fifty plus years, I can't point to any particular scene and say, ""this wasn't in the American version"" but I'll wager that the few extra minutes of footage in the european version improves the sense of menace and the general set up of the plot, and the quality of the images is very, very good. There are no added features other than the original trailer. All in all, ""The Crawling Eye"" is far better than its lurid title and better than many science fiction/monster movies of the fifties and sixties.",1356220800,3,2128,4.384810126582279

I'm not even going to cite them for the appearance of the monster as some do. It was the 50s. It was made on a shoestring budget. What do you expect? My only beef about the movie is the americanized title (and the DVD cover). They should have stuck with the Trollenberg Terror as the name.

Really, it only falls short when you get, you know, to the crawling eyeball creatures.  But on the kind of anemic special effects budget English horror films had, it's understandable.  Of course, it's still crawling eyes.  I meran, really, crawling eyes.  All you need is Navy SEALS armed with squirt guns filled with fresh-squeezed lemon juice.  Tucker was the American lead witrh an all-British cast, a formula Hammer Horror pioneered with great financial success in their first horror film, The Quatermass Experiment.  They wound up sticking with that formula until developing their own in-house stars, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  As I said, this film does work very well right up to the confrontation with the titular occular stars after which you just have to go with it.  It's still enjoyable.

While the science is quite daft, it is made rather sensible by the somber explanations of the resident scientist who just happens to have a lab up the mountainside opposite the Trollenberg.  As folks start to disappear and keep doing so, good ole alpha male, Forrest Tucker is sent for to investigate just like he did in the Andes all those years ago. On the train going to the little Alpine village, Allen Brook (Forrest's character) meets two foxes, both hot to trot and one of whom has great mental prowess.  When she faints and her head lands in alpha males lap, she immediately gets up and says how dare you!  Naww!
Anyway, as things get hotter, the investigator takes a team of hardy villagers up to find two climbers (a rather sinister climber along with a jolly ole soul who reminds one of Santa with no beard).  They have disappeared.  Upon reaching the cabin, they find the jolly soul headless.
To make a long summation short (too late), they end up taking refuge in scientists bomb shelter type lab and the Eyes attack, with tentacles yet.  A bomber comes....and...well, you will have to judge for yourselves.

I think as a child the concept of a tentacled eyeball must've fascinated me as I liked to draw the monsters in my doodle pads. As I developed a sense of quality I assumed that this was just another melodramatic cheesy monster flick with the lowest production values.

This movie is a step above the usual dreck when it comes to storyline, with some decent acting, an a pretty honest attempt to tell a sci-fi/horror story that might make sense.

It involves a supposedly haunted mountain top in the Swiss alps that seems to swallow up people who approach a weird, perpetually cloudy area. I won't go into too much detail, so that you don't know the entire story, but it does make an attempt to explain it's horror.

916429,3,6304680236,"Given the gore and spatter of modern horror films, it is hard to believe that England originally rated this film for audiences aged sixteen and older.  Originally filmed as an English television serial and then refilmed as a motion picture, THE CRAWLING EYE has also been known as THE TROLLENBERG TERROR, THE CREEPING EYE, THE FLYING EYE, and CREATURE FROM ANOTHER WORLD.  Released in 1958, it came in two versions: a longer one for English and European audiences and a shorter one for American audiences.  This particular version restores the film to its ""European"" run-time.

The story is a bit convoluted.  Essentially, Alan (Forrest Tucker) is working for the U.N. when he receives a summons from old friend Professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell, with a really bad German accent) to come to Trollenberg, where a peculiar cloud with radioactive properties has settled on the mountain.  Could this be just like that other horrible thing they experienced in the Andes Mountains some time ago?  They hope not, but psychic Anne (Janet Munro) seems to be tapping into something strange, and pretty soon heads roll, dead men walk, and the entire village has to flee before an alien invasion.

1950s B movies are usually pretty bad, but THE CRAWLING EYE is surprisingly good.  You won't find any fancy special effects, and the script has the occasional lapse of internal logic, but the actors are solid and the whole thing clips along at an enjoyable pace--and when the aliens are at last seen they are both mildly disgusting and mildly amusing.  This is a classic ""throw some popcorn at the screen"" flick, silly but not so much that you completely loose interest in the film.  Recommended for fans of the genre and style.

A United Nations science expert (B movie guy, Cameron Mitchell) is called to Switzerland to investigate a number of gruesome beheadings high in the Swiss Alps. Along the way Mitchell meets the usual pretty girl in these pictures but here, the girl travels with another girl, a clairvoyant(Janet Munro).  The creatures at the tops of Alps sense the clairvoyant and she can sense them.  This brings the film to its conflict as the ""Crawling Eyes"" have to take her out to remain undetected.  As the monsters come closer and closer to the town more murders, more strange happenings until.....we meet the EYE.  Ok.....you have to watch film to find out the rest.

Also known as the Trollenberg Terror - its about , well , literally a few Crawling Eyes that are ripping the heads off of people or mentally controlling people to go after Janet Munro (she is telepathic and senses them) I have a very special place in my heart for movies like this and will always enjoy a crisp chilling creepy monster movie shot in black and white. This was the very first MST3K experiment on Comedy Central. I can watch this movie either way. It is a low budget movie,but not incompetent at all. Well paced and great photography.

However, I will give the writer of this one credit for his imagination with the ""monster"" star of the movie. Giant eyeballs???  Now who would have ever thought that up?  It does make you laugh out loud when you see the eyeballs peeking in at the people inside a building, then to see them making their way up the side of the mountain is almost too much for even someone like me, who is a huge fan of these old classic monster movies.  Honestly though, the storyline isn't too bad, even though the eyeballs are pretty funny looking.  The whole concept is pretty funny, but I loved the movie. The cast wasn't too bad, and of course there is a hero of the show (Forrest Tucker) and a pretty lady who catches his attention.

The decade after the end of World War II produced a bumper crop of the finest science fiction films ever made, many of which remain classics to this day. ""The Crawling Eye,"" released in 1958, certainly does not rank among the top ten of the decade, but it is nonetheless an interesting story told in a reasonably well-made film. The plot is tight, coherent and logically consistent, and the acting of the British and American cast is as good as the typical standards of the day. There are some moments of genuine suspense as scientists race against time to figure out how to fight an unseen murderous force that inhabits a strange radioactive cloud high in the Swiss Alps. The ""crawling eye"" creatures of the title, when they appear late in the film, are about as good as the special effects technology of the day could make them, complete with tentacles very obviously manipulated by wires suspended from the ceiling of the sound stage.

This DVD is advertised incorrectly as a ""Widescreen European Edition""--it is actually full-frame format. It is ""European"" only in its title, ""The Trollenberg Terror,"" as it was released in Europe, and the obligatory British Board of Film Censors ""X"" rating before the opening credits. The black-and-white transfer is crisp, sharp and contrasty, but overall the film is marred slightly by what seems to be more than the usual amount of dust, scratches, hairs and other defects. The only extras are a grand total of three count 'em three still photos and an extremely poor-quality trailer.

At this low price, ""The Crawling Eye"" is hard to pass up. You'll definitely get your money's worth if you have any interest at all in science fiction films of the '50's.",1176422400,21,1847,4.8386075949367084

916590,4,6304680236,"""The Crawling Eye"" (aka, ""The Trollenberg Terror"") is a better-than-average low budget sci-fi entry from the late 1950's.  As is the norm for many of the classic sci-fi movies of that era, radiation plays an important role in the plot.

In this film, aliens are drawn to the Earth (for some unknown reason) and move mysteriously up and down the Trollenberg Mountain by way of the aforementioned radioactive cloud.  The acting led by TV veterans Forrest Tucker and Janet Munro is actually above the norm for a movie with this limited of a budget.  The secondary actors are also a little better than expected.  The plot moves along nicely and there are few ""down"" moments in the film.

The only major criticism that I have of the film is that the special effects used to create the aliens is suspect, even for a film in the 50s'.

The viewer is led to believe that the ""eye creatures"" (consisting of a giant eye and a few tentacles) can easily move around even though they have no visible motoring legs or appear to have the ability to float in the air. I know....what do you expect... George Lucas and his special effects team?

With that being said, fans of sci-fi movies of this era will definitely want to add ""The Crawling Eye"" to their collection.  It's much better than most from this genre'.",1166313600,4,1297,4.58008658008658

Who could forget the magnificient snow covered mountain range towering above the quiet Alpine village of Trollenberg with those thick, mysterious cloud formations nestled around the higher elevations and peaks. It was an eerie feeling knowing that within those vaporous white forms moved large, grotesque alien creatures consisting of one giant eye and long octopus like tenacles. When you saw the clouds begin to move down the slopes towards the village you knew what was about to happen, THEY were coming.

If their appearance wasn't frightening enough, how about the fact that they had the ability to communicate telepathically with humans. These communications added a somewhat occult flavor to this sci-fi feature that successfully generated even more angst into the mind of the viewer. But worst of all was the unearthly sound they made. Ohhh... that screeching was something that belongs only in ones' most frightening nightmare.

916596,2,6304680236,"The Crawling Eye (Quentin Lawrence, 1958)

Veteran TV director Lawrence didn't do much in the way of feature films, and after watching this amusing little dog, it's pretty easy to see why. Alan Brooks (F Troop's Forrest Tucker), a scientist on holiday, encounters two lovely young sisters, Anne (The Day the Earth Caught Fire's Janet Munro) and Sarah (The Doctor and the Devils' Jennifer Jayne) Pilgrim. He's on his way to see an old friend, Professor Crevett (Gormenghast's Warren Mitchell), who's tracking a radioactive cloud hanging over Mt. Trollenberg in the alps. As the American title of the film tells you (it was released in Britain as The Trollenberg Terror), said radioactive cloud is not alone...

While the movie itself is a bit like what one would expect from your average Z-grade fifties monster flick, it does have a few aspects that would later go on to become staples of great horror films that were, at the time, unheard-of-- the scientists refer to another expedition in foreboding tones (about which we never really find out anything), and more importantly, everyone's thrown into the situation without much real reason for being there, giving an added sense of dread to the proceedings (a tactic used with great effect by John Carpenter twenty-odd years later in The Fog).

Other than that, though, there's little reason to consider this any sort of film artifact; it's overacted, silly, and the monster itself, while original, is cheesy as all get-out (one thinks that the ""monster"" was actually created by gluing a fake eye onto a baby octopus). With one exception early in the film, the special effects are cheesy even by fifties horror film standards.

The film stars Forrest Tucker as a heroic UN scientist who figures out how to fight the giant eyes with Molotov cocktails.

The plot is fairly coherent with a few diversions including a smarmy romance subplot with a psychic, frozen cable car drama that veritable screamed ""bad idea"" from the outset, and the lamest one of all involving a mother evacuating from the gaseous eyeballs losing her daughter in a crowd of about six people when the child goes searching for her lost ball. (This subplot made me audibly groan and roll my eyes, although the resultant tentacle slicing was well done.)

Mountain climbers are experiencing the weird and mysterious in and around the radioactive cloud that clings - ""It's not moving, Alan!"" - to the western face of the mountaintop and the alarmed scientist (Warren Mitchell) in his state-of-the-art aerie laboratory - there are two television cameras on the roof! - is worried.  Remember the Andes Incident, Alan...?

  The cover art on the dvd jacket kept me from opening this one for about three months.  Radioactive mutations may have been all the rage in the `50s - THE CRAWLING EYE, a.k.a. THE TROLLENBERG TERROR, was made in 1958 - but I'm not much of a fan of the genre.  I expected to loathe this one, or maybe, if I was lucky, it would be mildly amusing.

  So it was with a great deal of surprise that I found myself caught up in this story.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The script contained real tension and the situations weren't nearly as absurd as I feared they'd be.  Even the special effects, though primitive, were relatively effective.  Especially the first on-screen appearance of the eye - although later, during the `March of the Crawling Eyes' sequence the tattiness of the special effects unfortunately imposes itself.

  Forrest Tucker plays Alan Brooks, a man with vague ties to the investigative arm of the United Nations.  Janet Munro is Anne Pilgrim, a stage psychic with a seeming ability to communicate with whatever is contained within that radioactive cloud.  There are assorted other interesting characters - the scientist in his fortress laboratory, a town full of frightened villagers, and enough foolhardy mountain climbers who scoff at danger and, if they don't find themselves with their heads ripped off at the roots, return with a weird and wild look, a lose of depth perception and an inability to tolerate a warm room.

  THE CRAWLING EYE is one of those rare movies that should entertain the whole family.  Don't let the opening title card announcing the production company - Eros Films and the Censor Board's title - Approved for audiences, no child under 16 allowed - concern you.  No obscenities are uttered, no clothes are removed, and no unseemly act of violence is committed.

916636,3,6304680236,"OK. This is a movie based on a popular television (?) series in England called The Trollenberg Terror. Our print of the movie actually had this title rather than ""The Crawling Eye"" which, I will admit, was why I bought this. The movie stars Forrest Tucker as an American investigator working on behalf of the UN, or something like that. So our pal is riding along on the train across the swiss alps in a traincar with two sisters, one mousy and frail and the other an overstuffed full-blown vixen-type. The mousy one has a Deanna Troi moment and falls, conveniently, into the arms of our hero. She insists that they get off at Trollenberg where our hero is also disembarking. They are greeted (""One room, or two""?) not very warmly by folks at the hotel. In fact, all the townspeople have been stampeded by a series of nasty ""accidents"" up on the mountain: people losing their heads while climbing. Literally! Now, this starts out as a pretty good movie. The plot moves along, the cinematography is very good, the acting is fine. The gore is nicely contained such that it's effectively scary when you see the headless body, the head in the bag, etc. It all falls apart when you finally see the giant eyeball. Oh, come on! They are AWFUL. I absolutely laughed out loud. At least the tentacles explain how the eyeballs were tearing people's heads off. I couldn't help but think that instead of molotov cocktails, they should have held the eyeballs at bay with a squirt bottle of lemon juice. When the airplanes came to napalm the eyes all I could think was ""fried eggs"". In fact, this brings me to a question: what was an American citizen doing calling in the RAF to drop bombs on Switzerland?

Another question: What were the sisters for? The ""sensitive"" one passed out when the going got tough and they needed her to talk to the eyeballs. The whole subplot could easily have been dropped. And except for the non-sequitor scene mentioned below, they didn't add anything.

The non-sequitor scene of note: The vixenish sister leans in for her close-up in her drapey low-cut dress and it was effective enough to induce my spouse to sort through the scene index to enjoy it a second time.

Nice crisp picture, original widescreen transfer, theatrical trailer and a most EXCELLENT creepy menu.  The only thing lacking here was the cover art.  Surely the original theatrical art was better.

The Crawling Eye is a great little film that is full of the mood, atmosphere and characters that make these old monster movies so much fun.  The mountaintop sets were well done and added an element of isolation that helped build the suspense.  The special effects scenes were also quite ambitious for their time.

For those who haven't seen this film, don't be put off by the cheesy looking eye monster on the cover.  This image in ABSOLUTELY NO WAY even slightly resembles the actual army of creatures that terrorize the mountaintop.  Although you will not see them until the last 20 minutes, the actual creature effects are very well done and are probably above average for films of this era.  Check out the cover of It Came From Outer Space.  There's another 'cover' monster that doesn't resemble the actual creature in the least.

916714,4,6304680236,"Although this little gem is hampered by a typical ""monster on the loose"" title, I happen to think it's one of the best of the creature films of the 50's, 60's and 70's. The plot is literate, the characters well-rounded, the dialogue believable and logical, and the atmosphere suitably creepy. Janet Munro makes you believe in her character's telepathic abilities, and Forrest Tucker is quite good as the reluctant monster-hunter. But it's the (obligatory) scientist who is my favorite character, played with great realism and understated emotion by Laurence Payne (?). The banter between the various parties makes for a very realistic portrayal of people caught up in an extraordinary circumstance. Some viewers may find this film rather talky (especially since the creatures aren't actually seen until well into the second half of the film), but there is enough plot development to keep things going nicely. And the B&W photography adds to the creepiness factor, as it usually does with films of this sort.

Now, about those creatures....

It amazes me that, given the nice production values of the film as a whole (and the widescreen cinematography), the bug-eyed aliens couldn't have been made to look more realistic!!  Their DESIGN is quite nasty and creepy, but the manner in which they were photographed--no slow-motion at all--makes them look like the little table-top models that they obviously were. This is nowhere more apparent than in the film's climax, where fire and explosions are used to dispel them as they crawl over the mountaintop laboratory protecting the film's heros. What looks like matchsticks burning probably is!! I can't undertand why the decision was made to film the creatures in so OBVIOUSLY an unrealistic way. However, that's my only gripe with this film. In all other respects, it's a well-crafted sci-fi / horror story, done with obvious feeling for the genre.",1097107200,7,1895,5.146103896103896
916715,3,6304680236,"THE TROLLENBERG TERROR or THE CRAWLING EYE is a British production written by Jimmy Sangster and directed by Quentin Lawrence in 1958.

Giant crawling eyes are hiding in a radioactive fog resting on the slopes of the Trollenberg mountain in Switzerland. When infortunate climbers enter the fog, they are simply decapitated by the eyes. By the tentacles of the eyes, I mean. Meanwhile, a young British girl with telepathic powers is attracted by the mountain. The eyes send two zombies to kill her but she's saved by the hero Forrest Tucker, a United Nations observer.

Well, that's a screenplay, isn't it ? A little bit irrational maybe, but, remember, we're in the fifties and strange things happened then in the world like the birth of John Travolta, for instance, so let's be tolerant. The copy presented by Image is superb and the actors are surprisingly good for this kind a production. Recommended if you're a movie lover.

The Crawling Eye also includes fine music by Stanley Black. Released in 1958, The Crawling Eye has the feel of good British TV from the early Sixties (probably because it was based on a TV series).

916719,4,6304680236,"The Crawling Eye (1958) had numerous monikers like The Creeping Eye, The Flying Eye, and even Creature from Another World, but started out as a British television serial titled The Trollenberg Terror (this is the title that appears in the beginning of this version of the film).  Apparently the series was popular enough to warrant the making of film versions for European and American distribution.  The film stars Forrest Tucker, who, while not an original member of the series, was brought in by the British studios in order to better promote the film in America.  Original series actors that transferred from the television version to the film version were Janet Munro and Laurence Payne.

The film starts off with three climbers on the side of a mountain, and one of the climbers suffers a serious case of death from the loss of his head (off-screen).  The other two freak out and then we cut to three characters on a train, two being the Pilgrim sisters Sarah (Jennifer Jayne) and Anne (Janet Munro) while the third being Alan Brooks (Forrest Tucker).  All three get off at the same stop, and make for a hotel near the base of the Swiss Alps.  Brooks arrived at the request of a friend, Professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell), who works in a nearby observatory and has disturbing news.  The two sisters, one with telepathic abilities (Munro's character), are inexplicably drawn to the mountain.  We soon learn that something is stealing mountain climber's heads, leading some villagers to believe an abominable snowman with a guillotine is on the loose, aptly called `The De-Nogginizer' (okay, no one said it, but I thought it).  Brooks makes his way to the observatory and meets with his friend Professor Crevett.  Crevett gives Brooks the ten cent tour, bragging on and on about his wonderfully amazing, technologically advanced and highly fortified observatory to which Brooks cuts it shorts and asks why he was dragged out here.  Dr. Crevett shows Brooks a cloud on the mountain, and makes a reference to a shared past experience and believes there is a link to the cloud and the recent spate of deaths on the mountain.  Turns out there is...

Not much point in going into the story too much more, spoiling the fun for everyone, but I will tell you this, there are more deaths by beheading, giant eyeball creatures, zombies, mysterious ice clouds, and some other cool surprises.  As silly as all this sounds, the overall sense of the film is serious...even though the viewer will break out into laughter, especially at the special effects.  The tentacled eyeball creatures various appearances just do not allow for the keeping of a straight face.  I couldn't help wonder if they had kept the mystique of the fog, revealing less about what was inside, if that would have made the film much more scary than it was...the tension was certainly there up until the point when the creatures were revealed, as the cloud hid its' secrets well, prowling the mountain, signaling death was coming.  Well, being the 50's, you needed some fantastic creature, be it giant eyeballs, flying brains, or disembodied hands.  If you didn't, you were pretty much cheating the audience.  I really enjoyed the number of elements involved in the story, and how nicely these things were tied together.  That's not to say everything works and there are no plot holes, but the film is tight, and any missing plot points are minor and not very detectable.  This film is just all out 50' sci-fi fun, much in the vein of another movie that came out in the same year, Fiend Without a Face.  Cornball?  Maybe, but certainly worth watching.  Forrest Tucker is great taking time off from his usual westerner/action films to star here.  He certainly doesn't seem to fit the part in the beginning; at least to me, but as the film progresses, he makes it work, like pounding a square peg into a round hole.  Janet Munro is attractive, and I had just recently saw her in The day the Earth Caught Fire (1961), but the real eye catcher was the actress who played the character of her sister, Sarah Pilgrim, Jennifer Jayne.  Yowsa!  Along with being an actress, I found out she is also a writer, and is responsible for (as Jay Fairbanks) the comedy/horror/musical Son of Dracula (1974) starring Harry Nilsson, Ringo Starr, and a slew of other musical talents.

Image and Wade Williams present a really nice looking wide screen print here.  The picture is crisp and clear, and suffers little deterioration.  Also, this is the European edition; hence the beginning credits stating The Trollenberg Terror as the title.  A trailer is available on the disc, but it certainly suffered the ravages of time, looking very worn and damaged.  There is also liner notes written by journalist, columnist, film historian, radio and television commentator David Del Valle, who is considered to be one of the leading authorities on the horror/science-fiction/cult and fantasy film genres.  If you can find a better giant, killer eyeballs from space movie I'd like to see it.

Even with extra material consisting of just the trailer, this DVD is well worth it. Especially to a fan of the film. I also found the liner notes to be emtertaining and very interesting.

916723,4,6304680236,"Retitled The Crawling Eye for release in the US, The Trollenberg Terror (1958) is considered by many to be just another bad 50s sci-fi movie (it was even featured on Mystery Science Theatre 3000). In actuality, it is far superior to the standard MST3K fare. Like Destination Moon, the significance of the film can be overshadowed by the low budget and sometimes questionable acting, but both films pushed the science fiction genre in new directions. Destination Moon is obviously the more significant film - effectively ushering in the so-called golden age of science fiction film, but The Trollenberg Terror certainly merits a viewing for anyone interested in the genre.
Perhaps most notable about The Trollenberg Terror is the degree to which it blends the science fiction and horror genres. In the opening scene of the film the lead female character, played by Janet Munro, becomes entranced when she sees the Trollenberg mountain. Soon after, we learn that she is telepathic - part of a mind-reading act with her sister. She is the most innocent of all the characters in the film, but to the monsters/aliens on the mountain, she is the most dangerous.
Other elements of horror abound in the film including bloodless zombies and, for the time, graphic violence - with a memorable but brief shot of a severed head in a backpack. It's by no means on the level of 50s science fiction classics like The Day The Earth Stood Still and Invaders From Mars, but it is far better than its reputation suggests.",1078704000,2,1502,4.87109375

Later, however, in one of the film's more interesting subplots, the aliens decide to possess the bodies of their victims rather than decapitate them, for the purpose of killing the aforementioned female (they don't want her exposing  them with her telepathic ability).

He is called to the Swiss town of Trollenberg because a scientist friend (one studying 'cosmic rays' at high altitudes) feels that events (mysterious deaths and disappearances) are linked to a similar occurrence in the Alps some years back.  An occurrence that led to a great deal of embarrassment for Tucker (who blew the whistle a tad too late).  Genre buffs will get a kick out of some of the sequences that clearly influenced John Carpenter when he made The Fog twenty some odd years later (in the commentary track on that disc, Carpenter states this movie's influence on him) and the groaning bug eyed aliens are still effectively gross.

A very good mysterious plot - spooky, and atmospheric - good acting and an actress, Janet Monroe - who with a bad haircut, worse teeth, funny eyes and a crooked mouth is also very cute in a wholesome sister-ish sort of way. She is very believable and projects all her fears onto the viewer.
I took the eye monsters as realistic and a total terror as a kid.  Especially - their exelerated hyper breathing along with a little bell that sounds when they are up to their evil tricks.
Up close the eye creatures are menacing, large, and gross.

But from a distance the monsters look more like marshmellows with pipe cleaner legs. - Infact most of the minitures are shoddy, cheap and not at all believable.

Tucker encountered the same phenomenon in the Peruvian Andes recently, and lost credibility with Uncle Sam for suggesting it was actually some kind of spaceship.
But, just as in Peru, hikers start losing their heads  -  literally.  Other unusual occurrences are noted, such as dead people getting up and going for walks, with murder on their minds.

The method of destroying the monster is predictable but it happens just as the monsters are about to break into the last refuge of the scientists and villagers who have fled.

And, as any film buff knows well, the ""B"" in B movie does not stand for 'bad'. The B movie shelves are loaded with many undiscovered gems.
This film, despite its title, is one of them. Like a few other British sci-fi movies, this one got its start as a serial on the BBC. Entitled ""The Trollenberg Terror,"" it told the same story as we see in the film. The film rights were then purchased by Tempean Films and the story was put on film. (Other films to receive this same treatment were ""The Quartermass Experiment,"" remade as ""The Creeping Unknown""; and ""Quartermass and the Pit,"" remade as ""Five Million Years to Earth,"" both by Hammer Films.)
To make the film more palatable to American audiences Tempean added an American star (Forrest Tucker) and changed the title for distribution to America. The file now became ""The Crawling Eye,"" a perfect name for a ""B"" sci-fi monster movie.
However, do not judge this film by its title. It is a tense item concerning a radioactive cloud lying atop a Swiss mountain waiting for hapless climbers to come its way. UN investigator Allen Brooks (Tucker), on vacation in Europe, stops by the village of Trollenberg to see his old friend Professor Kravett (well played by Warren Mitchell) at Kravett's observatory on the mountain. Kravett fills Allen in as to what's going on. Could this be the same as in the Andes a couple of years ago? Brooks denies it because it's not the same, but suddenly notes that a mentalist act on their way to Zurich just had to stop off at Trollenberg. Why? The film weaves its was to a fast-paced climax at the observatory as Brooks and Kravett try to save the villagers from whatever's in that now rampaging cloud. The only minus in the movie is the ridiculuous looking monster, but that's usually the case with 50s sci-fi flicks. Note how well ""The Thing"" worked in the abscence of the actual monster.

By the way, it's all we had back then. best wishes, Jean's  husband Jim",953596800,6,780,4.202702702702703
916964,3,6304680236,"This film is somewhere betweeen classic sci-fi and  the sea of driftwood cheeseball 50's monsters.  It has a dreadful giant eyeball with tentacles, a ridiculous story that makes the science on Irwin Allen shows look  intelligent, but it is entertaining and it has Forrest Tucker.  The story  is bad, but somehow interesting and I think that is just because the cast  seem so convincing about their fear of the monster.  The main standout is  Forrest Tucker, a good performance can make an average film good, as is the  case in this film.  Tucker plays an adventurer-tough guy to the hilt.  In  this movie and the Abominable Snowman he is like the sci-fi version of John  Wayne.  This film is worth seeing at least once.",944265600,3,719,4.693548387096774
916965,3,6304680236,"One really can't get too serious about these grade B films.  They filled a niche, by satisfying our curiosity about aliens and our power to remain in control.  The special effects weren't too special, and Forrest Tucker's  performance wasn't stellar.  But look for an actress named Janet Munro  (Ann).  She made this, and appeared in The Day The Earth Caught Fire.  She  died at age 38, but probably would have been a regular in sci-fi films.",919382400,,442,4.723684210526316

I received a box for The Crawling Eye and a DVD that was incorrectly marked The Crawling Eye, but when I played it the movie on the DVD was Night of The Ghouls, and not The Crawling Eye! :(  I wish I had read the other one star reviews before ordering this DVD.",1505606400,,281,4.090909090909091
7876232,5,6304680236,"This movie is based on a British TV series The Trollenberg Terror.

A mysterious cloud is occupying the mountain. People are mysteriously disappearing or at least their heads are detaching. Alan Brooks (Forest Tucker) has seen this happen before and is familiar with the phenomenon so he is sent to investigate. Also Sarah Pilgrim (Jennifer Jayne) a psychic in a sister act is compelled to go there; if you do not keep your EYE on her she has a tendency to wander off in a trance.

There is something funny about one of the disappearing villagers that suddenly returns.

It looks like the only hope for the town's people is to head for the lab at the top of the sky lift as it has thick concrete walls. The lab is equipped the standard 50's SCI/FI equipment. Yet your future is cloudy (radioactive cloudy). When confronted by a mysterious eye will you freeze in your tracks or do you have a tentacle to be lifted by the experience.

Do not watch this movie if you are in a cabin.",1504742400,7,979,4.4525139664804465
