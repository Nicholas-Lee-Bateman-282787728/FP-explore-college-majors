I'm out of college now, and still every Passover I think of the video and my brother and I sing the songs from it (well, whatever we can remember).  The characters are very entertaining, and it serves its educational purpose well - we never forgot the story of Passover!  I can't wait to pass on the legacy to my children.",1223164800,,436,4.425
8293274,5,6302353998,"This video is done by the same puppet troupe (and has the same characters) as the award-winning ""Chanukkah at Bubbe's"" and is the second in their Jewish holiday series.  That was the reason I bought it sight unseen  -- and I was not disappointed.  In fact, I think this video even surpasses  the Chanukkah episode.
 Bubbe is everybody's loveable Jewish  grandmother, who runs a boarding house with a zany variety of characters  living there.  In this story, all -- well, almost all -- of them pitch in  to help Bubbe get ready for Passover.  You guessed it -- the lazy guy who  tries to get everybody else to do his  share of the work for him ends up as  Pharoah in the flashback to the days of Moses.
 Among of the cutest  things on the video are the talking haggadah (Passover book) and the  various ritual foods that come to life on the seder plate.  The songs are  good, too, combining old favorites with new originals.  (The ""Bubbe's  Boarding House"" theme song, while not about Passover per se, sure is  catchy.)  Every kid I have shown this to -- Jewish or not -- has absolutely  loved it.  Adults will enjoy it, too!",958262400,7,1124,4.4504950495049505
8293275,5,6302353998,"The best review can only come from my children.  My 2 year old son after watching this video know the entire Passover story and can sing all the songs from this video, which are traditional songs sung at a passover  seder.  My daughter also loves it and at 1 tries to sing along.  The both  laugh at the kid friendly jokes.",951091200,13,323,4.229508196721311
