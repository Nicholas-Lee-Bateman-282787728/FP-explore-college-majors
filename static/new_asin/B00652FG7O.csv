4959249,4,B00652FG7O,"It is hard to believe that this year marks the 50th anniversary of The Jetsons. While they have been heavily overshadowed in favor of The Flintstones, the family of the future has had a everlasting impact on animation that still remains enjoyable today, as it did back in the 60's, and when they came back in the 80's as well. The show with George, Elroy and its season which introduced Orbity has had a great deal of laughs in the 1980's. But through it all, in a great deal of animation during Hanna-Barbera's classic giants, they still are just as fun as you could imagine. A few years ago, the shows second season started to be released on DVD, but not all of the cartoons were released for die hard Jetsons fans. But more are still coming and they are worth the effort.

The Jetsons: Season 2 Volume 2 continues the Jetsons classic 80's run to a whole new generation of those whom are into Spongebob Squarepants or The Penguins Of Madagascar. The collection of episodes still remain as classic today, as they were when they came out in 1985. The DVD features a lot of favorites for die hard fans, and are fun to enjoy for all ages whom have never seen Astro, Jane or George in laughter and action. The episodes have all been remastered, and include funny shorts including To Tell The Truth, where George gets stuck in a situation into a accidental space trip, while Jane is eagerly awaiting for him to return for a dinner for two out, and Swiss Family Jetsons where George gets laid off, and the family moves to a a asteroid called Paradisio for rest and relaxation, which comes back to haunt them, and A Jetson's Christmas Carol, giving a nice twist on the holiday classic where Astro opens his gift early and gets ill, as is where Mr. Spacely keeps George working late while Mr. Spacely shows a Scrooge-like anger at letting his bossy ways get the better of him with ghosts of the past, present and future coming to warn him of his ways.

All in all, if you did buy the first Volume of The Jetsons Season 2, than you'll definitely want to buy this DVD set of The Jetsons: Season 2 Volume 2. Even if you haven't seen this great classic family of animation yet, than you really should give this DVD set a great glance at. I loved watching The Jetsons when I was a child, and it still feels just as classic and funny today, as it did back then. You definitely know why The Jetsons are the family of the 21st Century, and this is a great template of what Hanna and Barbera made a great team in making funny cartoons.

They love this series and, along with the Flintstones, demand it in the car, at home, everywhere. Good old fashion cartoons are a good alternative the current mediocre stuff on CartoonNetwork.

4959301,1,B00652FG7O,"I knew already when I bought this that this were cheap DVD-R
What I didn't know was the lack of subtitles and closed captioned, which I find terribly disappointing, first of all, because I want to share this show with hearing impaired people and with non english speakers, and second I find it terribly disappointing that I payed way too much for this vol. 2, this volume is more expensive that the first season and  S 02 Vol. 1 and made cheaper, at least the other two had everything a DVD needs, this is just a shame, if you don't care about this and sharing it with people that need subtitles, buy it, but well, they should put a warning to it.
Shame Hanna Barbera.",1369958400,24,668,4.344

4959306,2,B00652FG7O,"I Have a DVD recorder set-top box as my main player with no intent to copy these DVD-Rs and do not want a player only box, So why am I penalized because I don't have a player only set-top, Plus Burn type DVDs don't have good archival life-span which is 2-7 years then read errors happen, while press DVDs live for 100 years!!!! I have season 1 and season 2 vol 1 on pressed DVDs Which play on all players even recorders and PC Drives. They will work 25 years from now but burned DVDs will not. The 2 star rating is because of the burned DVDs otherwise it would be 5, Simply because it completes season 2. But like I said, Vol 2 will not play in the future because of the dyes in DVD-Rs fading away over time. Another thing, They are single layer DVD-Rs meaning you lose 50% quality. The press DVDs are dual layered. I'll wait until they produce pressed DVDs for season 2 vol 2 and season 3, And any other DVD releasses of any titles.",1356480000,16,933,4.1602209944751385

Hanna-Barbera made these cartons in the 1980's, in the style of animation used on the original Jetsons episodes of the 1960's, to make the series feel consistent.  And the stories are good as well.",1355011200,5,386,5.015625
