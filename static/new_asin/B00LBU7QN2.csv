There may have been too much explanation or recap for my case, which felt like I was being told a lot of what was going on through character dialog as opposed to being shown through the scenes and action. Still, very entertaining.",1487116800,,404,4.625

8665051,3,B00LBU7QN2,"The original Rozen Maiden series was excellent. It was clever, funny, and had a serious undertone. You also cared for the characters and their relationships to each other. You also got into the ""Jun"" personality. The use of flashback and the artistic style of it also were unique.

But this retread/sequel series is a bit weak. Rather than continuing the original story after where it left off in Season Two of the series they do a ""what if?"" scenario. That is ""what if Jun didn't wind?"" and therefore meet Shinku?

It's interesting and fun to meet all the characters again, but honestly it doesn't add much to the original series. The introduction of the final doll is powerful and different but you feel that it should have been done in the storyline of the original series. Even the first episode of this news series rewrites the story a bit from the original and its ""alice game"" of a second season.

My recommendation is if you have seen the original series you might want to watch this one to have an interesting twist on it, to meet the final doll, and even to find out what was Jun's original problem at school, but if you haven't seen the original series then please don't start here. See that one first (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rozen-Maiden-Season-1-Collection/dp/B005OK0YNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rozen Maiden Season 1 Collection</a>.

8665055,4,B00LBU7QN2,"$60 seems like a lot for DVD. Why isn't this available in BluRay? Three discs yes, but there are only 13 episodes. That's over $4 per episode, in standard definition. I like this show, and most people who have seen it already have seen it in HD. Sentai needs to release this on BluRay.

EDIT:
Alright, I added a star now that it is down to $30. I bought it and it is good. Even though the English cast is different from the previous series (Japanese cast is the same), I do like the voices after getting used to them. Shinku is hilarious interacting with Jun!
Standard size dvd case but for holding three discs, no inserts, nothing really special as far as bonus features.",1410220800,2,672,4.376

8665057,4,B00LBU7QN2,"Jun Sakurada is a middle school hikikomori who one day receives a strange letter asking him if he will ""wind or not wind"". He chooses to wind and soon strange living BJDs (ball joined dolls) called Rozen Maidens are showing up at his door. In another universe, collage student Jun Sakurada chose not to wind. He hates his classes, his job, and his life. Everything changes when he receives a text from the self that wound.

I never saw the original Rozen Maiden or read the manga or knew much about it other than it involved living dolls. The first episode of this series was therefore a little confusing, but while I am sure much went over my head, the rest of the story was easy to catch on to.

I found the collage Jun's struggles and growth to be the most interesting part of the series. He starts out totally pathetic, but by the end he has grown enough to start taking hold of his life and making a change.

I liked the character designs and art style, and the dolls seemed a very accurate portrayal of the BJDs I've seen. At one point collage Jun assembles a doll and you get to see all of the parts and how they fit together.

If you like dolls, this series is probably worth checking out for that alone. If you fear dolls, well, other than their size they look just like the humans in the show. So you probably will be ok. Unless they come out of the screen and attack you.

For me this series was about a 3.5 star rank, but I thought it deserved to be rounded up rather than down because I think a fan of the original series would probably enjoy this a lot; seeing all of the characters again and seeing what would have happened if Jun hadn't wound.",1408924800,2,1659,4.253968253968254
