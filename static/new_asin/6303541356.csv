7849983,2,6303541356,This movie is animated and doesn't have the actors. Its ok but it doesn't stack up to the original live action film.,1284422400,,116,4.318181818181818
7849984,4,6303541356,"ok so yeah the movie started being shown in promos on TV I was obsessed with MK 1 and 2 on my SUPER NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM oh yeah and then WAL-MART had this 8 dollar video cassette that promised a MK cartoon and behind the scenes footage of the new MK movie

and it had it..

pretty groovy stuff the computer generated fight sequences with KUNG LAO and GORO were cool

and the cartoon was pretty cool but man it was such a TEASE I wanted so much more whcih I eventually got in the movie..

I wish they had put the stuff from this VHS into the DVD  of the first MK movie

but I own it so it's all cool!",1146960000,,609,3.9508196721311477
