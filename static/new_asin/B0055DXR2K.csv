8458105,3,B0055DXR2K,"I have all these videos, they have helped quite a bit in the understanding of modes  My problem is I find myself fast forwarding thru most of his solos
I am sure he has reasons for his solos, but if you break down the material, by FAR the MOST time is spent  learning his solos. He acts apologetic when explaining the little theory involved, like the people watching are too stupid to understand. I bought this series to learn modes, and the THEORY behind them, and I bet most are the same  How about some tips on making the modal notes stand out in a solo or some fancy chords to enhance the one being used Never any tips like that or tips on string noise or whatever  Just saying the SAME THING OVER AND OVER like he is great and we are stupid Same with his vids on songs, never a mention on the type of delay, distortion  or whatever How about a tip on playing a hard passage clean, like its a secret, to make sure you buy another video",1487635200,,939,4.137362637362638
8458106,4,B0055DXR2K,"Understanding the modes in guitar playing can unlock so many different musical ideas, especially major sounding tones. Years ago I had a lot of musical training and bought this DVD to remind me and help me remember. I would like it a lot better if there was some on-screen tab and the notes of the scales the instructor is demonstrating burned in a lower-third but he speaks very clearly and goes slow, he speaks the note names and their fretboard positions so if you work with this disk you'll definitely unlock Lydian.

Good luck and good music to all",1392854400,,553,4.585858585858586
8458107,3,B0055DXR2K,This was a good dvd but I thought the style of Danny Gill was not as close to Steve Vai as I had hoped. The scale and mode was on the right track. But I have made up songs that sound closer to Vai than this video.  But this is a great video on learning the Lydian mode.,1372636800,,269,3.6379310344827585
