6284645,5,B00IP347BM,I have been interested in Cambodian history since working with some survivors of the Khmer Rouge in the 1980's.  I teach history at the high school level and believe my students would be able to understand the horror of it through the use of figurines in the movie.  The amount of work and detail in the carvings is incredible.  I found the movie fascinating.,1405900800,2,359,4.578125

6284647,4,B00IP347BM,"Last year I promised to indulge myself in the many documentaries that were getting buzz and good ink throughout the year.  The documentary is a genre that I often unfairly ignore, and I understand that in order for me to embrace film as a whole, I need to embrace all avenues.  Just like my gradual warming to the Animated Film genre, it took me a while to fully embrace the Documentary, but once I did my love truly soared.

What I found this year were a number of documentary features that tried unique ways to explore a troubled past/present, and three of them found themselves with Oscars stamp of approval (all of them losing to those soul singing sistas).  The Square, which was my favorite of Oscars nominees, was the most conventionally told documentary in the mix, but it explored the current political unrest in Egypt with such passion and understanding.  The Act of Killing was not a film that really sat well with me.  Exploring the Indonesian atrocities from a truly cinematic and artistic vantage point seemed like an inspired idea, and yet it didn't really strike the chords I think it wanted to; at least not for me.

The Missing Picture rests somewhere in the middle.

The Missing Picture tells a very tragic and heartbreaking story of one mans life in politically disastrous Cambodia.  Rithy Panh fled the country for Thailand in 1979, after experiencing terrible treatment under the Pol Pot regime.  To say that I was unaware of this slice of world history would be a complete understatement, considering that I had never heard of these atrocities in any avenue.  Sometimes I feel like Americans as a whole are so horrifically uneducated as to the ways of the world in general.  We live in a bubble of comfort and turn our ears away from all that goes on away from us.  Not everyone, obviously, but as a whole.

There are so many beautifully composed ideas here with regards to Panhs reflection on the conditions he endured, but also the guilt associated with his inability to stop it.  I really admire the honesty with which Panh broached this difficult subject.

The artistic merits here are bountiful.  The use of clay figurines are not only visually inspired, but they play well into the themes of childhood innocence lost, that purity that is missing from the world he grew up in.  The use of archived footage spliced between these play sets was jarring and effective.  My only qualm here is the monotone narration that I felt lessened the impact and made the film somewhat hard to maintain focus on.  It was delivered in such a dull and apathetic way that I found it hard to really invest in, despite the weight of the films message.

I give this a B, mostly because so many of these elements line up just right.  Its just a shame that the delivery betrays the films set up and leaves me wishing that Panh had found someone with a sharper way of delivering his message, vocally.",1404345600,,2903,4.6399217221135025
6284648,5,B00IP347BM,This package was delivered on time and in excellent condition.  I like the different stories told by different authors from their perspectives  about Cambodia.  This will allow me to learn about Cambodia from many angles.  The world should learn about Cambodia under the Khamer Rouge so we do our best that this will not be repeated again.,1402531200,,339,4.894736842105263
6284649,4,B00IP347BM,"Several reviewers have commented on the basic themes of Rithy Panh's documentary; what is perhaps more interesting is the way in which the title operates on two levels.  First, Panh's film aims to fill in ""the missing picture"" of life in Cambodia under the Pol Pot regime.  For most of the time, the only visual material available on this regime was propaganda films depicting an idealized world of workers happily contributing to the new country Kampuchea's collective sense of well-being.  Through a mixture of clay figures and archive footage, Panh proves the opposite; most citizens had to get used to a combination of perpetual hunger and enforced labor.  The clay figures are an important element of this film, suggesting that human beings can be rendered malleable in any way their makers/ captors choose.  At another level, the film tries to recreate the ""missing picture"" of Panh's past; at the age of fifty, he looks back at his childhood in the pre-Pol Pot era, a world of color and variety that was ruthlessly swept away, as the people were forced to wear black and work inhumanly long hours in the rice-fields.  The experience left an indelible mark on Panh's character, as he lost most of his family due to starvation, without being able to do a thing about it.  Even now he feels guilty for his inaction.  Living under a tyrannous regime was bad enough, but what was much worse for Panh was the way in which that regime rendered him powerless, as well as depriving his life of the possibilities - both personal as well as professional - that could have been available in the pre-Pol Pot era.  The ""missing picture"" cannot be recreated, however hard he tries.  The film ends on a somber note, as Panh reminds us how much the souls of the millions who died during the Pol Pot regime still haunt those who survived.  While efforts have been made to erase the past (a lake has been built over one of the mass graves), he still feels somehow united with the dead rather than the living - an indication, perhaps, of the emotional and physical consequences of tyranny.  While THE MISSING PICTURE offers a country-specific interpretation of the past, its message should be heeded by everyone about the consequences of living under an absolutist government.",1401062400,,2263,4.789203084832905
6284650,5,B00IP347BM,"Woke this morning to NPR's (National Public Radio) on THE MISSING PICTURE, this movie by Rithy Panh. It wasn't the reporter's words, but the soundtrack of this movie which grabbed me. I've never heard/heard of before. Native music on  instruments I'd never heard was scored with screams and sounds of mayhem, agony, anguish and razing of Cambodia itself
and its people by the Khmer Rouge. The soundtrack was a montage of wailing pleas,  threats of KR shoulders, screams, shots, explosions, crashing trees and burning huts. All mixed together beautifully, horribly. People of all ages from infants to children to teens, a culture being viciously destroyed.

In the early 1980's in Kampuchea, Cambodia renamed, I talked with teens, grown up Cambodians, of the few survivors. Eager
to talk to an American (as Asians were, hearing english. testing the few words they knew, they opened up. Vivid descriptions of tortures, massacres, burning villages and vicious rabid KR troops.

Truth can be good. These truths, very bad. Horrific. I spent only four days walking with a few Cambodians, struggling to describe, point out mass graves, remains of villages, bones of people. A few more days visiting temples and cities, rebuilt villages and homes of Kampuchea. Why change their homeland's name? Some said to let their people forget. Others said to not frighten tourists away. Earlier times in Thailand, in the 80's, Thailand's King was said to
have pronounced an edict: Mess with a tourist and you won't live to get to the police station. I repeatedly heard a story of a Thai man who killed a tourist. He got to the police station alive; but
had been shot, put into a cell and left to die. 'Rich falangs', a Thai world for non-thai's; can't remember the Kampuchean word for Americans and Europeans... Round Eyes? Heard that name elsewhere in Asia another time.

I'm pre-ordering THE MISSING PICTURE. Meantime I'm going to re-see THE KILLING FIELDS, an award-winning film of years ago. Tremendous movie of reporters caught in that war zone then. War zone? Genocide would be more like it.

I bought The KILLING FIELDS DVD about 13 years ago, for $15.95 at Amazon. Now it's $49.97, used for $10.32 in Very Good Condition, run for it, in Amazon MarketPlace.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Fields/dp/B00124PXWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing Fields</a>",1396137600,,2403,5.293963254593176
6284651,5,B00IP347BM,"This was Cambodia's entrance for the 2014 Oscars as best foreign language film. It tells the story of Rithy Panh who narrates his tale of what happened to him and his loved ones when Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge  took over Cambodia. Renaming it Kampuchea and taking the country back to year zero. He uses a mix of archive footage and clay figures which have been carved by hand to recreate what took place. The missing picture are the parts of history that was not photographed and as such only those who were there can bear witness to the atrocities that took place.

When the capital Pnom Penh was emptied - over two million people were uprooted and moved into the countryside. They had every modern thing taken away and were only allowed the clothes on their back - except the shoes and a spoon. The clothes had to be dyed black. They were forced to work in the collectivised camps often doing menial back breaking work that had no real value except to crush the will of the people. The individual as a concept was ended - the party was all that mattered. Death and disease were rampant and this is all told using the clay figures. The Khmer Rouge used to fire slogans at the people all day so that even now Rithy Panh can remember them all verbatim - like `Each being will be a revolutionary or fertiliser for rice'.

There are scenes of animal cruelty here from the archives too as well as humans being mistreated. It can be a difficult watch in places but the narrative is often quite poetic. It is all in French with good subtitles. A very moving and sad account of what this poor man went through and told in an unusual medium. Whilst it may seem to be less immediate because of the little figurines, it still packs quite a punch when you hear what took place in 1975 to 1979 to a country the world seemed to have forgotten about.",1396137600,9,1837,4.3654970760233915

6284659,4,B00IP347BM,"History, it is said, is written by the victors. But sometimes, it is the victims - or more accurately, the survivors - who get to do the writing. That is the case with Rithy Panh, a Cambodian who survived the horrors of life under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. Panh was a mere child when he suffered the loss of his parents and siblings in the various grueling work camps to which they had been consigned. As an adult, Panh went on to become a documentary filmmaker dedicated to telling his story to the world. It was a purge aimed mainly at the intelligentsia of Cambodian society - the well-off and educated - who posed the greatest threat to the regime's vision of a collectivist agrarian utopia.

Where, Panh asks, are all the pictures of children starving, of people being worked into the grave that more accurately portray the reality of this 20th Century holocaust? Somehow, those were not recorded and preserved for posterity. Instead, we get a series of grainy propaganda images - of workers seemingly happy in their toil, of leaders of the revolution inspiring the masses with their promises of a Communist paradise - that were officially sanctioned by the government. So Panh has taken it upon himself to provide the ""missing"" pictures the Pol Pot regime failed to provide to the world.

The Oscar-nominated documentary ""The Missing Picture"" is a stark, haunting illustration of what life was like under Pol Pot's brutal dictatorship. The director alternates between grainy, mostly black-and- white footage taken at the time and diorama-style re-creations using strategically arranged and intricately carved clay figurines. These frozen, expressionless figures, with their searching, unblinking eyes, lift the suffering that the actual people endured to a near-surreal level, while the wistful, soft-spoken narration by Jean-Baptiste Phou echoes the human tragedy at the core. Indeed, the approach Panh has taken manages to personalize a holocaust that, given its enormous breadth and scope - an estimated one to three million people died under the regime - would otherwise be incomprehensible to the human mind. ""The Missing Picture,"" by ""going small,"" paradoxically helps us to see the tragedy writ large.",1408406400,3,2218,5.124309392265193

6284661,4,B00IP347BM,"For shear creativity I cant think of another recent film that supersedes this Oscar-nominated film in finding a way to tell a story that is important, requires the use of images and yet the original images are lost.  Ill leave it to my fellow reviewers here, who have posted more detailed reviews and, apparently, know more about the history presented here than I do admit I do. This is not a film with claymation stop-action technique. The hand carved figures (10s of them!) never move and are not animated. But each is unique.

The DVD version from Strand presents the original Oscar-nominated version with the French narration and english subtitles. But it also has a new English narration. I chose the later, simply because I could then watch the images instead of reading the subtitles. And, unlike dubbed films, the narrator is never seen so there is no synchronization issue.
And, while I felt the quality of the photography and the story the words were telling was both important, I found the tone of the narrator had very little change in the inflection of his voice and , after 30 minutes (of the 96 minute running time), beginning to lose interest. But I stuck it out to the end.

Because of the English narration issue I can only give the film four stars.

But I do recommend that you see it. It is Oscar-worthy.

There are no other special features on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The most expressive piece of mixed media art I have experienced.  Simply viewing the intensity of work and labor invested into The Missing Picture with each clip of original (miracle) film, hand made characters in the thousands, the original sounds, the music, the voices, the photography angles of what literally is documentary meets biographical enveloped in fine art sculpting is truly unspeakable and can only be shared with tears. I want to give Rithy Panh the worlds biggest longest hug.  I almost feel ashamed to comment because this film is a Masterpiece and I am not qualified; but, I want you to know how deeply moving, a great artist lives in The Missing Picture.",1514764800,2,828,4.6506849315068495

I have learned a lot about the Khmer Rouge period and felt a little fatigued by the topic (it is not an easy one to immerse yourself in), but this film is very different from anything else I've read or watched. In fact, it's very different form any film I've watched in any genre. There is something powerful and personal about the still-life scenes and hand-molded figures. Even without live action, it is never dull. The narration is simple but evocative and poetic. A heart-wrenching film that will stay with you.",1460937600,,549,4.670103092783505

8644384,4,B00IP347BM,"This is a fascinating film. The little figures are used so well to portray scenes from the era and give a poignant touch to the film. The film also uses superb and rare footage from the Khmer Rouge era interspersed with the figurines to enhance our understanding. Unfortunately as in Duch: Master of the Forges of Hell, Panh chooses to use footage of vivisection on animals when he brings up the unpleasant fact that in S-21 people were experimented upon. This detracts from the film overall as I found this confronting and alienating. Apart from that, this is a superb and clever film, useful for both historians and those who are first learning  about the era.",1441152000,,662,4.706896551724138
8644385,4,B00IP347BM,"""The Missing Picture"" (2013 release from France/Cambodia, original title ""L'image manquante""; 96 min.) is a documentary from Cambodian/French director Rithy Panh, who was 12 years old when the Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia in 1975. Using a unique mix of archival footage (mostly shot by the Khmer Rouge regime itself) and careful reinactments with clay figures, Pahn shares with the world what it was like to grow up in Cambodia as a youngster in the pre-1975 years, and then what day-to-day life was like under the Khmer Rouge regime.

Couple of comments: this is truly one of the more remarkable documentaries that I have seen in a long, long time, and one that I will not forget easily. Cambodia was completely shut off from the rest of the world during the 4 years that the Khmer Rouge brutalized the Cambodian people, and as a result the only footage that exists from what happened happens to be filmed by the Khmer Rouge itself (not unlike, say, how the Nazis filmed their atrocities as well). Time and again, Panh juxtaposes the rhetoric and propaganda by Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders against the archival footage and the contrast between the propaganda and the reality of things couldn't be bigger. The use of the clay figures may seem strange at first, but it is a welcome `reprisal' from viewing the archival footage, and it allows Pahn to reconstruct images and scenes from his childhood which he so treasures. A note of caution in case this was not apparent yet: there are a number of shocking images and scenes in the documentary, to the point that I had to look away at times, so viewer beware. That does not make this movie any less compelling or important. Just like so many documentaries on, say, the Holocaust, people NEED to see this so that we can learn from it and (hopefully) prevent this from happening again. For that reason alone, this documentary should be compulsory viewing for all high school students, or certainly HS juniors and seniors. Please note that you have a choice of watching this in its original French language version, with the voice-over provided by director Panh himself (and with English subtitles), or an English-dubbed version. When you hear Panh's voice, you can feel his pain and anguish coming through. I listened to the English-dubbed version for a few minutes, just to check it out. So plain and basically unlistenable.

Given the importance of the topic, and the top-notch quality of this movie in general, it was good to see that this movie scored a 2014 Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Movie (it lost out unfortunately to the far less deserving and overrated Italian film ""The Great Beauty""). If you are in the mood for a serious and at times harrowing and haunting lesson in history, by all means check this out. ""The Missing Picture"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1440460800,,2850,4.802443991853361
8644386,5,B00IP347BM,"This most unusual documentary was nominated at the Academy Awards festival for Best Foreign Picture.  Even if it didn't win the category I think it is very well worth watching.

Most people know that the reign of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia is one of the worst episodes of genocide in modern history.  Of course its convenient to forget that American bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam war had a hand in bringing to power an insane and evil regime, or that our former enemy Vietnam was the power that finally stepped in and put a stop to the Khmer Rouge.  The filmmaker here, Rithy Panh, is not interested in overly political statements.  He is interested in telling the world what it was like to live through the period 1975-1979, in which the rest of his family perished.  Since there was no objective or outside film making in the country during that time, Rithy makes brilliant use of Claymation, his own narration, and occasional use of propaganda footage filmed by the government to tell his story.  Profoundly moving, beautiful, sad, nostalgic, poignant, and highly personal, all at the same time.  This film belongs in film history.",1439683200,,1156,4.773869346733668
