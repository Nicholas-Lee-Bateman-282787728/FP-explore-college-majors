8116661,5,B000F39QUC,"I bought a couple of these DVD's on a whim once at our local dollar store. Since any DVD's I buy there are usually pretty bad I obviously wasn't expecting much. I got lucky with these because it's a really cute show that both my kids like and I don't hate. I have kids that vary in age from 3 all the way to 10 and they will all watch it without complaint and that is really saying something!
 It's a cute retelling of fairy tales where they story is about to take a wrong turn which would mess up everything for the characters involved. In comes the fairy tale police department to make sure everything goes as planned. The officers are fun, the girl reminds me a bit of Scully from the Xfiles, she's a very no nonsense girl. The guy is a vain ditz who is always messing things up. They also have a police chief who has anger management issues and a couple of other friends. All in all it's a cute show and something different. Unfortunately twice now my kids have somehow ruined all of our DVD's of this so I'm here to buy more, but hey it's worth it!",1344124800,,1053,4.161764705882353

8116663,5,B000F39QUC,"Every re-telling of a fairy tale changes the story a bit, this one more than most. it puts modern police types into the fairy tale land. We picked up one disk at a local discount store. My four year old loved it, so we went in search of more. They only had one more. We bought it, and weeks later she's still watching them both at every opportunity. Yes, the theme song is permanently imprinted on my brain, but at least it's a cute song. So, I did what any smart mom does, and turned to Amazon. Found the entire series at an amazing price, and my little girl's face lit up! I'm happy about the bargain, she's happy about the show. Life is good. I'm a mean mom. I only let the kids watch TV or play video games when it's raining or dark. Otherwise, they have to play outside. My child said she wished it would rain! My seven and ten year old children like the series, too. I only wish there were more of them.",1234569600,,909,4.112359550561798
8116664,5,B000F39QUC,By far one of the best Fractured Fairy Tales events dealing with two copies from our world trying to keep the historic Fairy tales on track but creating new versions of the stories in the process like when the little mermaid falls in love with Johnny the male cop or when by accident they arrest the 40 thieves before meeting Ali Baba.,1215475200,,335,4.419354838709677
8116665,4,B000F39QUC,My two kids (age 7 and 10) love this show.  They both give it a two thumbs up.,1182211200,3,78,3.3333333333333335
