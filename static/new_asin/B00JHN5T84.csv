8651063,5,B00JHN5T84,"No matter where you stand on abortion, ""Zealot"" will challenge the way you think. Protagonist John Talbot's beliefs on abortion are completely true to the teachings of the Catholic Church, but his mental illness leads him to take action that's counterproductive to the pro-life cause. We all need to remember there are right ways and wrong ways to fight for the causes that matter most to us.",1400803200,,392,4.865671641791045
8651064,5,B00JHN5T84,"This is one movie that really hits home. This movie enables you to feel each of the characters as you are made to question your stance on the subject manner. Some scenes were very graphic but necessary to convey the obvious convictions of the writer. A must see movie, filmed in the style of Raging Bull. I recommend this movie for every home theater library.",1397779200,2,359,4.538461538461538
8651065,5,B00JHN5T84,"Zealot:  A hard film to watch at first, but mesmerizing.  It drew me into the spectacle of my faith by reminding me of the faithfulness and dedication of other more committed Catholics.  This film is an opportunity to witness to the problems some face in the Pro-Life community while considering in depth our own recourse to evil and level of personal responsibility.  Slow moving at times and somewhat repetitive at the start, but well worth the time to watch an excellent Michael Chovanes performance and a very good well told story illustrating an intriguing and challenging life.  The camera provides a personal voyeuristic expose with sometimes violent and gruesome detail.  Zealot may make you consider your own role in the Churchs response to the abortion holocaust reminding you of your own responsibility and how well we live up to the expectations of our Lord.  Thank you, George Foster for your excellent cinematic direction and the supporting cast for giving us interesting characters.  Zealot is a very well done film worth watching which may lead to a possible cult status.  So good, I had to watch it twice.",1397692800,3,1122,4.957219251336898
8651066,5,B00JHN5T84,"Do you want beauty? Watch it.
Do you want truth? Listen to it.
Do you want substance? Take it in.
Embark on a journey with a man who sees through the comfortable veil most of us place over evil and struggles as most of us never have to find an adequate way to fighht it.
This movie has a weight and gravity and truth and beauty and a brutal honesty that is rare to see. Can you handle it?",1397347200,,388,3.9240506329113924
8651067,5,B00JHN5T84,This film is a rare take and perspective on the issue of abortion and how some of the faith deal or don't deal with it. It is riveting and keeps you guessing to the very end. It may make some uncomfortable because it reveals some very uncomfortable truths...even ones the industry and some in the church would rather not admit. A must see for Catholic bishops ! Oh...especially great performance from the lead character!,1397174400,3,420,4.6891891891891895
8651068,5,B00JHN5T84,It was a very interesting movie. I liked it a lot. I enjoyed the black and white cinematography. I would recommend to anyone interested in the pro-life movement,1397174400,,160,4.75
8651069,5,B00JHN5T84,"Know the old saying, ""It made me laugh and it made cry""? This movie literally made me laugh and cry!  It was very good-if you're into an artsy-type movie.  That said, it also is a little hard to follow sometimes and I had to watch it a couple of times before I got everything (not sure if that was on purpose).",1397174400,,310,4.065573770491803
8651070,5,B00JHN5T84,I approached this movie not expecting much but came out thoroughly surprised. Morality is a heavy underlying tone through the entire film and leaves you connecting with the protagonist for the entire film. It is a superb introspective into the modern day struggles of society's views and staying true to Catholic dogma. Mike Chovanes has me in tears by the end of this film.,1397088000,,374,4.859375
8651071,5,B00JHN5T84,"Foster is as uncompromising in his direction as his zealot is with his convictions.  The result takes the viewer to a place he'd never go on his own.  This movie is not easy to watch, but it is nevertheless important.  Rather than tell you what you should believe, Foster pushes the question on you relentlessly, urging you to take a stance that cuts through polite rhetoric and good intentions by which we've become indoctrinated.  Chovanes is convincing; his physical pain is somehow overshadowed in comparison to the mental and spiritual anguish that drives him.

On the surface, this is an artistic pro-life film about a character who struggles to make a difference.  Zealot is far more than that.  You'll leave asking yourself important questions about our society, and perhaps more discomforting, yourself.",1396828800,5,812,5.106060606060606
8651072,5,B00JHN5T84,"An artistic tale of a troubled young man who is trying to deal with a dark secret. It was very well written and artistically shot. The movie brings to life issues that are taboo in our modern day, politically correct, morally bankrupt society. The movie forces you to take a stance and understand the battle for life that we choose to ignore. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a soul!",1396742400,4,394,4.486111111111111
