8095679,5,B00006FDBF,"I purchased the movie to watch a scene a friend appeared in, but as I watched the movie I really began to appreciate the clever writing and humor. I have since re-watched it three times with friends who have really enjoyed the movie.",1349827200,2,233,4.441860465116279
8095680,5,B00006FDBF,"...then you should definitely check out ""The Auteur Theory"". It's extremely clever in its writing and execution, examining (and making fun of) the extremely competitive student film world (which is like the elephant world -- sorry, that's a reference to this film...). The acting is very good, for the most part, the musical score is excellent, and the photography is good (especialy the bad student films, some of which are brilliant in their awfulness). My only problem with this movie is that sometimes it's more clever than it is funny.",1030752000,7,540,5.011111111111111
8095681,5,B00006FDBF,"I thought this was a very well-made little gem when I caught it on Showtime, and I'm glad to be able to pick it up on video. There's an amusing murder mystery angle to it, but the main point of the film is to comically satirize the pretentions of filmmakers, who (in my mind) can always use getting the piss taken out of them. Congratulations to the actors involved in this film, as well as everybody else involved in the making of it. From the looks of it, they had a good time doing it.",1030752000,2,488,4.147368421052631
