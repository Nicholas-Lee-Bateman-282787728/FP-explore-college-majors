8088910,5,B000BMGEI4,My daughter recently saw this show on Disney Junior and loved it! She loves animals and so does Stanley. Since Disney Junior only had one episode available I immedietly went where I always go to find everything....Amazon!!! Sure enough there he was Stanley DVD's!!! They arrived in 2 days with my prime membership and my daughter is enjoying them in the car (the only place we still have DVD player).,1472428800,,400,4.728571428571429

8088913,5,B000BMGEI4,Wish there were more Stanley DVDs. The twins loved all three and hoped for more. There is much to learn from these videos!,1410393600,,122,4.3478260869565215
8088914,2,B000BMGEI4,"As much as my little girl loves Stanley and never tires of watching a Stanley dvd, she just was not interested in watching this movie version of Stanley.  It takes a minute before the Stanley characters appears and it may seem like an altogether different show.

I have tried several times to get her interested, even advancing the movie to the character's first appearance and still no go.  I don't know if anyone else have had the same experience, but thought I would share mine.

8088915,5,B000BMGEI4,"I have bought 2 of these cd's.  My grandson is autistic, and he just loves anything Stanley.  Unfortunately Disney quit making the cartoons.  I heard the creator died.  I wish I could get hold of some of the TV shows, but there is no way I can contact Disney. All I know is that it is so cute.  I bought the book and the two other movies.  My grandson is 5 yrs old, but has loved Stanley for at least 2 years, and I play them over and over for him.",1234828800,,448,3.868131868131868
8088916,5,B000BMGEI4,"The ""I've got a song that gets on everybody's nerves"" song?  It really gets on your nerves...  The movie is great and it's not as irritating at all.  even the songs kind of sticks to you.  My kids love it!",1173312000,,205,4.05
8088917,4,B000BMGEI4,"My little boy loves this movie.  He loves the series on Disney, and this just enhances it.  He has watched it at least 20 times now.  He likes singing the song about the great big book of everything.  Worth the money.",1168387200,,217,4.219512195121951
