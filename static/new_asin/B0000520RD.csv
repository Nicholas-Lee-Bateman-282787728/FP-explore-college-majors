How in the world did Christopher Plummer and Maximilian Schell ever end up in this 111 minute mess? Apart from the information that one gains in regards to the Bosnian struggle for freedom and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, this film is so incredibly bad in it's look, it's print, it's editing that one painful viewing is all that is required.",1182124800,2,601,5.08080808080808
