7944170,4,B00005LPZR,"It's supposed to be porno, but it's really a comedy. It has all the cliches of cheap 70s Hong Kong martial arts movies. That's probably deliberate. It's quite funny.",1383955200,,165,4.724137931034483
7944171,2,B00005LPZR,"I didn't find this one particularly funny or erotic, despite the presence of some very attractive women.  The women sumo wrestling was just plain stupid, and the overall plot was mostly lame.  I did enjoy the flashback scene of the two pretty women who at one time were lesbian lovers.  But that one brief scene does NOT a great video make.",1142380800,4,340,4.540983606557377
7944172,5,B00005LPZR,"I feel that ""Sumo Vixens"" Should have been longer. ""Kei Mizutani"" is A wonderful and talented woman. The sexy woman of Japan who drop their tops and enter the ring Are way cool. These sassy sumo wrestlers brawl their way to glory in this no holds barred film. If you ever get this movie, you might also enjoy The ""Weather Woman"" & ""Return Of The Weather Woman"" or ""Undressed For Success"" witch also stars Kei Mizutani as one of the sexeist woman of all time.",1123804800,3,458,4.4
7944173,5,B00005LPZR,"The 5 stars are for the wrestling scenes featuring Kei Mizutani- there's not much else in the film you'll want to watch after your first viewing. She wrestles a glamorous older lady at the very start of the film, and has a grudge match with her character's former lesbian lover towards the end. There's also a soft-core lesbian scene and a shower scene that you might enjoy. Kei and her opponents look wonderful in their tiny sumo loincloths,and there can be few things more pleasurable to watch than a couple of beautiful Japanese ladies wrestling and slapping each other in the near nude.",1096934400,12,590,4.737864077669903
