But there is a saving grace here, of sorts - the film exists in some never-never world, a unique blend of western tropes, retro-'50s sets, and (esp. later in the film) a sort of Gothic darkness.  More than anything, this dumpster-diving mix of influences and visuals kept me interested.  I also liked the small town, hard-bitten Midwest setting - the Mayor is a crazed dictator, and no one seems to care.  Is it always that way in places so isolated and unknown? Scary thought, and perhaps true.  Anyway, I was entertained.  Your mileage may vary.  Thanks for reading!",1453593600,4,731,4.65625

6871318,5,B00QJ64AZK,"Well, I guess I will just write a few quick impressions.  First off, the film definitely seems like Indiana or Illinois.  The people look and talk like people from south central Illinois or Indiana.

It's meant to be set in a sort of undefinable period, which gives it a weirrd feel.  For example, there's 1960's stoves mixed in with early to mid 50's cars, and then a 1965 pickup drives by.  The cops and the outlaws all carry single action Colt's and Winchester rifles from the 1870's.  Houses lit by kerosene lights have light switches on the wall.  Men are wearing long hair.  You just can't tell what time period it is.  I suspect it isn't all intentional, and some of the anachronisms are disorienting.  At the same time, it's just a good story and maybe setting in some time period in particular would have been distracting in a way, too.

It's a very good movie, though.  It reminded me of stories, families, and people I grew up with in the rural Midwest.  Really, the story is outstanding.  It is a revenge story, but it isn't a typical Hollywood revenge story.  There's plenty of ambiguity about what revenge costs, and how it can ruin your life.  I couldn't have predicted the ending, and that's pretty good.  I disagree with the reviewer who said there was overacting.  I thought the acting was first rate.",1438214400,9,1319,4.587982832618025

Was a total waste, in my opinion, these so called actors can't act and the dialogue sucks.

6871347,2,B00QJ64AZK,"As children Winston (Gregory P. Loomis) and Cashius [sic] (Louie Iaccarino) watch the sheriff (Mark Clem) gun down their father (Jeff Russell). Years later they team up with their cousin (John Druska) to enact revenge.

This is a story about revenge, anger, and redemption...easy on the redemption, but they talk about it. The film is low budget and I instantly noticed the substandard sound quality. The acting and dialogue for the most part was bad, with an occasional decent scene that Loomis manages to rescue.

The film takes place in 20th century Indiana and is not a western as one might surmise from the DVD cover. I would recommend spending my time and money elsewhere.

6871348,4,B00QJ64AZK,"I almost didn't watch this movie because of the lousy reviews.  Am I ever glad I gave it a chance.  Right from the start Winston was the hero  when you saw him at the dinner table talking up his brother, ""he almost caught a catfish so big.""  In return brother Cassius runs Winston down, ""he spent all day listening to the bullfrogs daddy.""  Later when the bullet hit the gristle, Winston was the last one out of the room on that riverboat.  That's character.  That's courage.  The whole movie is the cliched story of the wronged underdogs abused by the authoritarian system seeking vengeance.  Although it takes awhile for them to catch on.  They're a bit slow those boys.  Their land taken by the sherif and his corrupt cronies for a steel mill.  But it's a modernized western and it works well.  And it ends right.  The story is entirely believable because it's one that has happened in the real world, over and over again.  If you think hard enough, I bet you can come up with a whole list of middle eastern countries this story has played in recent years.",1432512000,3,1059,4.471204188481676
