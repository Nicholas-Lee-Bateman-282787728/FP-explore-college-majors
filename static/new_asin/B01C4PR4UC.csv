7671851,4,B01C4PR4UC,"Stories about indigenous tribes' encounters with white men almost never turn out well....for the natives, anyway. History is too littered with examples of entire clans being sacrificed, uprooted, or enslaved to the needs of expansion or business interests. Those who fought back were usually slaughtered, wiped out with all of their knowledge lost forever. It's a sad, brutal history, and that backdrop informs every frame of Ciro Guerro's stunningly beautiful, deeply thematic ""Embrace of the Serpent"", a film that within moments establishes itself as a must-see for those looking for something truly original.

Shot in exquisite black and white with a lush Amazonian locale, the film looks like a restored adventure classic, think Alan Quartermain if he were traveling into the heart of darkness. Set in the early 20th century, the story is loosely based on the writings of two explorers whose work comprises much of what we know about the ancient South American tribes. While a wholly fictional piece, you'll be instantly overwhelmed by the authentic period details, feeling as if a passenger on this mysterious, dangerous, and soulful expedition.

From the moment we meet the stoic tribal shaman, Karamakate (Nilbio Torres), standing on the water's edge with his face paint and muscular frame, we know he's not the type to suffer white men easily. We know he stands as a bulwark against their encroachment into ancestors' lands, he stands as a wall against rampant colonialism. That much is confirmed when a boat carrying an ailing white man, Theo (Jan Bijvoet) and his native companion, arrives on shore in need of help. That's not going to happen. Karamakate is the last of his clan, having seen them wiped out by the whites seeking to make a profit in the rubber trade. While all seems hopeless, Theo makes the one offer he can, and that's to take Karamakate to a place where some of his tribe may remain. While he refuses at first out of anger and distrust, the chance to rebuild cannot be overlooked, and Karamakate agrees to accompany Theo and help get him back to full health.

What follows is a strange, wonderfully exotic quest that examines the impact of rapid colonization and the obsessive thirst for knowledge. Karamakate, who is played by two different men in two different time periods, is understandably full of rage over what has happened to his people, and his early interactions with Theo are brusk, insulting. Years later, an aging Karamakate (played by Antonio Bolivar Salvado Yangiama) has a much different outlook on life when he encounters another white man, Evan (Brionne Davis), who is searching for the healing plant that supposedly saved Theo's life. Reconciling the two very different versions of Karamakate is one of the film's great joys, as Guerra skillfully sews the seeds of his evolution through pointed conversations and, occasionally, comic misadventures.

Beneath the beautiful, naturalistic imagery there lurks something dark and edgy, even frightening, making it impossible to forget the black reality of what happened to these indigenous clans. A latter encounter with a dangerous religious cult devolves into horror, a sequence that is so disturbing it nearly overwhelms the rest of the film which has unfolded in a deliberate manner. But there are is plenty of humor to be found in the many cultural clashes, smartly woven with considerable insight. For instance, a lost piece of technology that falls into the hands of natives becomes a funny and thought-provoking discussion about the negative intellectual impacts of such technology, a topic we still wrestle with today.

For all of its indescribable beauty and the unforgettable character of Karamakate, the film is still probably going to be appreciated by aficionados and not casual audiences. The pacing is slow, to say the least, and while gorgeous to look at there isn't a ton of variety in the scenery. You've seen one river you've seen them all. And Guerra, who also co-wrote the screenplay, doesn't make much of an effort to explain Karamakate's bizarre mystical ramblings, which is infuriating right up until the film goes full-blown psychedelic. Ultimately, ""Embrace of the Serpent"" is a mesmerizing, unforgettable film about the power of knowledge, and how it must be passed on through the generations. It's not unfathomable that we'll be seeing this film passed along, as well, to be studied and learned from for years to come.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Embrace-Of-The-Serpent-Blu-ray/dp/B01D0NBXX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Embrace Of The Serpent [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,,4624,5.311475409836065

It was so beautiful to look at, even though it was filmed in black and white. Mainly though, the film left me with the feeling that the disappearance of Amazonian cultures is an immeasurable tragedy.

7671857,4,B01C4PR4UC,"""Embrace of the Serpent"" (2015 release from Colombia; 125 min.) brings the story of two explorers who, 3 decades apart (1909 and 1940, respectively) explore the Amazon region, albeit with very different motives. They both end up enlisting the help of the same man, Karmakate, one of the few remaining shamans.

Couple of comments: first, it takes a while to fully understand and grasp what is really happening, and that the local is the same man, simply 30 years older than before. It eventually also becomes clear that this film calls out ""the white man"" for what he has done to the jungle and the indigenous peoples. At some point Theo (the first explorer) and his two travel mates come to a Mission, where a priest runs things. Later on, the effects of the 'rubber wars' become all too clear. Second, the movie is shot in gorgeous black and white. This is the second film in a row that I've seen in theaters that is in B&W, what are the chances? (the other film was ""Creative Control""). Third, Belgian actor Jan Bijvoet gives a truly stunning performance as Theo. You will be blown away. ""Embrace of the Serpent was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar this year. While it didn't win (""Son of Saul"" did), it doesn't diminish anything of the intrinsic quality of this film. With that, I've now finally seen all 5 nominees in the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar category, and I am amazed at the collective talent in those 5 movies.

""Embrace of the Serpent"" played briefly last month at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw it at was attend quite nicely, frankly better than I had expected. It confirms that there is a market for this type of top-notch quality foreign movie. Truly world cinema at its best. If you get a chance to check it out, be it on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it! ""Embrace of the Serpent"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1460419200,39,1931,4.626822157434402

7671861,5,B01C4PR4UC,"It is said that the age of the atomic bomb called forth as it were a new consciousness  one that might offset the destructive force unleashed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, then at least by the awareness that millions of completely ordinary human beings produced the horrors of the Nazi death camps.

The ""discovery"" of psychedelics, substances that arguably lead to a fragmentation of fixed ideas about who we are, inevitably led to precisely this kind of radical questioning of identity. As such it acted as a catalyst for a questioning of the established order during the 1960s. This, in turn resulted in a severe backlash against anyone pursuing any sort of alternative discourse. With hindsight we might argue that this backlash represented an attempt to suppress public debate about the dark side of human nature.

""Embrace of the Serpent"" represents an attempt to address two aspects of the renewed interest in mind-altering substances. The first of these identifies the origins of human experimentation with mind-altering substances not in the 1950s when LSD was first synthesized, but in the native traditions of Amazonian tribes.

This inevitably links such practices to the ""deep history"" of humanity. And in linking spirituality to healing it raised important questions about the nature of religion and mind-body dualism that is so fundamental to Western scientific thought. It also links to another subject: the horrors inflicted on native people as colonists murdered, raped and enslaved under the banner of a supposedly enlightened Christian faith. The attempt to portray these subjects in a mainstream movie signals a renewed public interest in native people and their spiritual and healing traditions and, hopefully, a preparedness to acknowledge and redress the crimes of the past.

The importance of this development is primarily ethical in that it signals a growing awareness that what happens in the world around us reproduces conflicts and contradictions within us. It thus allows us to conceive of the possibility of social transformation as something involving radical inquiry into who we are.

7671866,5,B01C4PR4UC,"Beautiful film, historically fascinating, multiple layers each telling their own narrative and also telling one story.  This film was a beautiful experience, as if it became a part of me.  Beyond the modern face of how we receive a story, a film, streaming internet, lonely faces on a bus staring into their screens, remains the human breath, the grandfather voice of 'story', the growl, the faint archetypal utterance from starry night on the edge of town.  Much of South American cinema challenges the perceived dominance, the ignorance and historical amnesia of the USA viewer.

I met these doctors, they where selfish, looking to score money on the cure for cancer, The doctors actually came in with there fancy boats, with fancy equipment and got sick. a private helicopter came to take them out. by the way the picture in the front cover does not look like the indigenous people of Peru, The face looks good but they wear actual today clothes that are brought in on the amazon river from iquitos.

Call it dream-like, or surreal (not the heavy handed kind, bunuel being an example, more along the lines of early Herzog, some Kubrick or Roeg.)... you are simply embraced and surrounded. This is my idea of perfect cinema. Multi-layered, thought provoking, stunningly shot and oozing atmosphere. I am repeating myself. Sometime's there are no words.

When I was 24 I flew into Peru with my guide Kenda we traveled up the Leaving from Iquitos we went into the jungle-after three days we came upon a clearing-Kenda told me to wait here. but first the reason for my being here-I was intent to gather plant samples-my degree is in Pharmacognacy (we study plant extracts to develop new medicines). Anyway after several hours Kenda returned and told me the Elders wish to see me -I entered the village and all of the tribe had formed 2 lines in parallel. All heads turned facing the ground.-I was welcomed into the hogan of the Elders-Kenda already explained my reasons. all turned their heads down except their Shamen Kenda said to follow-I did-He prepared a similar drink(yahee, vision vine-ayawaska ) A form guided me - I saw the instant of creation-through to the end (our end)-My message to all If we carelessly continue down the path we are on our fear,pain and loss it ends everything-I waited this many years for I didn't fully understand His gift to me not the shamen (Ana) but the guiding form-I now see almost an exact replay-and just like dominoes events are taking me from then to now-Please open your eyes and mind-ask anyone-we are close to tipping the first domino-WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE- terrorism is the same as a plague-It affects weaker,hateful and now when we attack after a terrorist it causes collateral damage (this feeds the plague-we have the ability to alter it all-One path is try to eradicate the terror plague-since 911 we have tried it it seems to not be working--of all our leaders I have yet to hear one ask the the question what they really want-my visions haunted me for years and brought me here to share my story. We have lost something -most have lost everything we are losing our compassion,our ability to choose and to think unencumbered . Most of all almost everyone has lost something or someone-to the terror gripping this planet-myself included. All through history aggression/war ended when a single man on one side said enough and meets an adversary and they talk find out they are not so different-with a handshake a cure of the plague is found. One Christmas in the 1940's American GI's met a group of German Soldiers-had a dinner ,talked, and silently made bonds of friendship-only hours earlier they intent on killing each other-why did this happen?? Maybe there was someone like myself initiated it? or both sides found out they were not so different after all. I was born American and I love my country and ALL it's people! I deeply respect our fragile world-and we have no escape if things go really wrong. We constantly pride ourselves to the fact that we are the first creature (unlike the dinosaurs) that have the ability to fend off risks that can end our world--caution -- what  if the end starts with in.. Nuclear nations have the ability to end all life on Earth-thousand time over (MAD-mutually assured destruction-a very correct acronym)-WHY?? The form that guided me in Peru said pass the test--What? I didn't get then but I think it meant we as a whole are being tested---we aren't doing very well. All of us have work to end what is happening- Thinking one person can help-maybe one can start the change. This time it is for life or extinction. If the radical individuals won't talk-or change the first domino falls- they are trying to force us into a endgame I stand with you and our Government-it is one path that causes my nightmares-I cry and have a heavy heart for all our soldiers that gave their lives to protect us-and innocent victims around the world. Such loss -(911, gulf wars, terrorist reactions- a young boy detonates himself in what was a day of celebration- again why?  I am a regular person like you--I saw the second path- a golden world prosperous-war and terror are a dim memory. The terrorist must stop or we all fail the test-If we are to pass the test and the terrorists,(radicals-whatever you call them ) we need to back our government and especially the soldiers and in the end we may be successful. I don't have an answer as how to get to the other path- but I have seen a prosperous kinder world.and we must start with you and change hate and fear in you into a fading memory-you might be surprised what replaces it.. As far as Peru went in three weeks the villagers helped to bring several samples they use for medicine-My initiation to the tribe was to do the ceremony--in their culture if you survive the vision you become one of the PEOPLE. All I ask is to just try to lift yourself above the terror and hate. I can leave this world with a light heart, happy. One thing I didn't mention is I have a progressive autoimmune disorders (several- with no cure). and I apologize that during the vision I saw the two paths but I was given no answer to end a horrific path and find the fork in the paths to walk the path of peace-it was wonderful-I don't think  it was just a drug induced fantasy. -Some time later Kenda told me what the elders said--The message you received is to be sent to those who will listen We (elders) can't go they said they are not even real people-no one would listen to us but you have seen and go back to your world and if we pass the test-maybe we will see each other again. Maybe in your hut in the northern lands--When the terror is gone I hope I live long enough to hear a knock at my door of my hut-lol  We have to try to pass the test I have faith in us all, and we can change- I did -and you don't have to vision ceremony-I already did and I brought you the information and I have nothing more-------------------Good Luck-----------Rob",1474243200,,5799,4.493838862559242

7672049,5,B01C4PR4UC,A fascinating philosophical journey into the world of the Amazon rainforest and human kind. In a span of forty years two European explorers come to see a local shaman who presumably knows the cure from all deceases. By the time the second explorer arrives the shaman grew into an elder man who began loosing a grasp on his purpose in life. Both explorers seem to have a noble reason in mind but would they be able to see and embrace the world that existed prior to the human civilization?,1474156800,2,488,4.49438202247191

7672051,5,B01C4PR4UC,"This is a visually stunning film that is based on the diaries of Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evan Schultes  German anthropologists. It relates to one Amazonian warrior called Karamakate. He meets Theo in 1909 who needs the drug from a rare plant to cure his illness and Karamakate is the only person alive who knows where it grows.

We have the parallel story some 30 odd years later when another scientist turns up seeking the same drug  from the same man. Both stories are intertwined but both very different. It also sheds light on the crimes of the colonial past, the wickedness of the rubber barons and the callousness and bigotry of the missionaries but it is all done in an unfolding and mesmeric way.

This is filmed in black and white but is stunning at capturing the beauty and majesty of the Amazon and the people. The acting is just superb  almost like you are being a voyeur on other peoples real lives. It lasts for over two hours as well, but does not seem like it at all. One of the best films I have seen this year and for reasons that are leagues apart from what would normally make a film unmissable.

The film is made in black and white which adds to it's moody atmosphere.

7672132,5,B01C4PR4UC,"This stunning, mysterious, mystical film is one that many people will want to see, even though they might not know theyve been waiting a long time to see it.
On the surface, Oscar-nominated Embrace of the Serpent is the fictionalized version of two real tales about white explorers and the native shaman who guides them into the Amazon jungle. Its about culture clashes, colonialism, environmental depredation and the death of tribal peoples. Underneath--sometimes hidden, sometimes hinted at-- the fierce and all-consuming spirituality of Amazonian tribal people is revealed in a way some white people might understand. Thus the film is more than a travel adventure, its a transcendent experience.
The stories, separated by decades in time, are intertwined. The first explorer is a German ethnographer, Theo (Belgian actor Jan Bijvoet) who takes his journey in 1925, accompanied by a young native helper who dresses as a white man, named Manduca (Yauenku Migue). Theo is dying (probably from malaria) and desperately seeks a rare sacred plant that he has been told could cure him, the yakruna. Reluctantly, a shaman named Karamakate (Niblio Torres) agrees to guide them to the plant. He lives alone in the jungle, the last member of his tribe that was wiped out by crews of white rubber workers. He has covered nearby rocks with many drawings, in rituals to connect him to his gods and help him carry on the song of his people. He watches the night sky where he knows the Anaconda descended from the North Star to Earth. Needless to say, Karamakate doesnt like white men, especially one who is sick and won't listen as Karamakate tries to help him. The whole venture is doomed.

About 20 years later, an older Karamakate (Antonia Bolivar) leads another white explorer on a similar journey. Evan (Texas-born Brionne Davis), is an American biologist, who claims he is also looking for the sacred plant Theo had written about. In truth, as Karamakate suspects, he is more interested in finding a rare disease-resistant rubber tree, to help in the U.S. war efforts.
Both scientists assiduously documented their journeys with drawings and journals and photographs. In honor of the vintage photos, Colombian director Ciro Guerra (The Wind Journeys, 2009) chose to shoot his film in black and white. The result is not a dearth of the wild variety of jungle colors, but a beautiful dream-like journey where black and white comes alive with a hypnotic intensity.
If youve had an interest in the spirituality and mythology of native peoples, and especially if youve experimented with hallucinogenic drugs (like most anthropology students do), you will be so engrossed in this story, that it might become a religious experience for you.
One of the most terrifying scenes in the film occurs when the travelers come upon a remote Catholic mission. The first explorers find a solitary monk who is caring forand brutalizing-- young native boys in an attempt to save them from slavery by the rubber barons.
The second time, the mission has descended into hell on earth. The mystery of transubstantiation, the Catholic belief that in the Eucharist, the bread and wine are literally changed into the body and blood of Christ, has been obscenely perverted by an insane Messiah. Its one of the most horrifying things youve ever seenand its supposed to be true. Karamakate grieves that the native people have become the worst of both white and native worlds.
By the time the second scientist has arrived, Karamakate thinks he has forgotten most of what he had once known. He feels hes a failure because he never became one with his gods and the wonderful, huge universe the gods gave him. But, he becomes convinced that Evan and he have shared a dream and this is a message from the gods that he must help Evan, no matter how dense a student Evan turns out to be.
When they reach the high plateau known as The Workshop of the Gods, Karamakate insists that his guidance has ended. Using a psychedelic potion, he paints circles on Evans naked back, telling him, This will take you to the serpent and she will embrace you.
Evan is on his own.  Dreams will guide you to become a warrior, Karamakate had told him. Every Cohiuno man must leave everything behind and go into the jungle, guided only by his dreams. In that journey he has to discover solitude and silence, who he really is. He has to become a vagabond of dreams. Some get lost, never come back--but those who do are ready to face whatever may come.
Exactly what the ending of the film means is something that you might argue about forever. One thing is for sure, youll never again make light of the mystery of dreaming.
Embrace of the Serpent was based on the journals of Theodore-Koch Grunberg (1872-1924) and Richard Evans Shultes (1915-200l). It was shot in the northeast Amazon jungle, on the Rio Negra river, on the border between Brazil and Colombia.",1472342400,,4894,4.866906474820144

Unlike a lot of reviewers  here i found no advantage to filming it in black and white.  Life is in color and i am not in appeciation because someone creates a fake mood by using old cinematic tricks. You will appreciate this if you are familiar with south american history, the culture,the amazonian plants or have worked with shamans yourself,  otherwise you won't understand this. I don't remember seeing any  woman in the picture however(except for a brief  tribal visit)did they not exist back then

The film thankfully deftly handles difficult topics without getting preachy or all social justice on the audience. Takes a stab at illustrating the different experience dimension that jungle isolation bring specially before our connected world. For example two years have gone by and nobody has return to the jungle mission. The mission's priest becomes a madman. You can pick and choose the reasons. The main subject are covered by the white man and the Indian and how they help and use each other and different stages of the story. Of course the Indians are ultimately conquered. The older version of the Indian and the new white explorer with baser interests shows that.

He spits out several phrases that epitomize his clarity--""you people have no discipline; you devour everything and die fat.""  He's outraged at the automatic use of guns and knives to threaten death--""you people bring violence and death wherever you go."" The effects of colonization are clear--from the missionary who whips native boys into parishioners, forbidding them to speak their own ""sinful"" language.  Later, on trip two, 40 years later, the ghettoization left behind the rubber tree clear cutting, leaving malformed native people dressed in western garb sitting around idly in a shack getting high from a sacred plant.  Young Karamakate, dressed in full shaman regalia, is outraged at the scene and confronts one of the men: ""how could you let this happen""?

Not for the passive film watcher and certainly is not one to bother putting on if you plan on chatting with your friends and family throughout.",1467244800,5,450,5.178082191780822
7672370,5,B01C4PR4UC,"A tremendous film! Many people will not like it, though. The story is based on the diary account and letters of a scientist-explorer who visited and researched the Amazonian peoples in the early 20th century. He gathered some of the native peoples tools and artifacts to take back to Europe along with all his notes. There were various tribes at that time, many of whom were kept as slave laborers for the rubber barons, the Colombians, or subjugated and tortured by Christian missionaries. The film simply re-enacts those events that the explorer witnessed and noted.

While that story is unfolding, another parallel story also unfolds that takes place about 40 years later: Another explorer is seeking the native guide, now quite old, who the first scientist describes in his diary. This guide had talked of the spiritual healing powers of an indigenous plant that grew on the rubber tree and caused the rubber tree to produce the purest rubber; the second scientist claims he wants to experience the spirit-opening result of ingesting that sacred plant so that he will be able to dream. He claims that plants have been his whole life and he wants to gain the wisdom the plant will give him.

While these two time-separated stories slowly unravel, the viewer sees an intertwining of lives. The story is filmed almost entirely in black & white; it is subtle, honest, forthright, tragic, mystical, and inspiring. While the horrific nature of the true events related in the story leave one shaken to the core, the depth and sensitivity of how the story was presented leave one feeling profoundly moved. The ending was perfect.

A quiet, intelligent, sensitive film that won the 2016 Canns Film Festival, ""Embrace of the Serpent"" is a film that will undoubtedly go down in time as one of the greatest films in history.",1467158400,99,1816,4.8896103896103895

But worse than that the movie is a bunch of fragmented scenes that don't go together in logical form. How easy it must be to make a film and not care whether it makes any sense. OF course, many people will think that THEY simply didn't get it... that they missed something. Nope. It was the director.

7672381,4,B01C4PR4UC,"Warnings. This movie:
- was shot in black & white
- moves slowly yet is 2 hours in duration
- is focused on two white men but is told from a multicultural perspective
- is sharply political and frankly depressing in exhibiting a devastated early 20th century Amazonia

Embrace of the Serpent begins with no context and we are forced to keep up with what might be going on after we are plopped down in the middle of the jungle. It should be noted the movie's two tales transpire in the jungle 30 years apart from each other. Although the story is fiction, the two scientists Theodor Koch-Grunberg and Richard Evans Schultes are not fictitious (but they are dead). You can even find their books right here on Amazon (how ironic... Amazon!), such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zwei-Jahre-unter-den-Indianern-Reisen-in-Nordwest-Brasilien-1903-1905/dp/3201002275/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zwei Jahre unter den Indianern; Reisen in Nordwest-Brasilien 1903/1905</a>&nbsp;(would snatch it up if I could read German) and the vastly more widely read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plants-of-the-Gods-Their-Sacred-Healing-and-Hallucinogenic-Powers/dp/0892819790/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plants of the Gods: Their Sacred, Healing, and Hallucinogenic Powers</a>.

One reason I gravitate towards these types of films or books (and am rating this one highly) is because since first learning about the Amazon jungle as a child, I'd wanted to be an explorer. Age coupled with a curious mind crushed this illusion after reading about the devastation caused by people migrating to Amazonia to exploit the natural resources; to realize it was already way too far into the 20th century to have an experience a white fella like me would've had in late 19th century Amazonia, or even just a century ago, was disheartening. These days, we're left donating to certain human rights and environmental NGOs in hopes that our planet's lungs (Amazonia) do not deteriorate further.

The lack of color in Embrace of the Serpent is clearly a sticking point for many, and I say to those people: watch Hollywood's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emerald-Forest/dp/B00NQ4FKQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emerald Forest</a>&nbsp;if you want to see a story in the dazzling green of Amazonia. But know that Embrace of the Serpent was shot by Columbian director Ciro Guerra, so is not confined to Hollywood's rules of audience engagement. Really, watch both movies to compare and contrast. The book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Emerald-Forest-Diary/dp/0571137318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Emerald Forest Diary</a>&nbsp;is in itself amazing: directors of these types of films go above and beyond the call of duty to create magic on the screen, and literally risk life and limb doing it.

If Nazis hated the Jews in 1940 and Atheists hate Christians in the year 2018, what is the difference? If you really want to be taken seriously by making a movie that is anti-religion, a filmmaker should go around the modern world and get video footage of all the major religions and show film of their negative practices. That would at least prove that your were motives were sincere. Another point I would make is the film's premise on how not only religion, but western influence had a negative effect on the native culture. On one hand filmmakers are saying westerners should leave the native Amazonians alone, but world health organizations, including many Christians have been helping poor people in Africa and all over the world for decades. Are the saying that should all be stopped? I know for a fact that activists and people in general would be causing mayhem if nothing was done to help these poor areas. I will say that personally I would like to see these native cultures maintain their ways and stay untouched by western civilization. I believe that due to globalization many countries are losing their culture. What is interesting is that many westerners are starting to search out their own culture, now that theirs is starting to change. For example, In Nordic countries there are people starting to look into their ""pagan"" past before Christianity arrived. Turkey was pagan, some form of Hitite, than Christian and than finally Islamic.",1521417600,,1794,4.904605263157895

I bought the DVD in hoping to share with some indigenous and Spanish speaking friends who haven't seen it.  The only subtitles on the DVD are in English.  If you turn them off, there are no subtitles.  Normally it wouldn't be an issue.  However, in the film many languages are spoken.  To understand the film without any subtitles, you need to speak Spanish, Portuguese, German, English, Latin, Huitoto, Okaina, Tikuna and Wanano.  If anyone reading this speaks all of these languages, please contact me!",1519430400,,569,4.91578947368421
