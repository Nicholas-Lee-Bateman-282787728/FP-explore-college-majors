8497298,5,B006G1WVD6,"This dvd is great for simple Spanish vocabulary support at home. I purchased this through zulily when my daughter was six months old. We used to watch it religiously, stopped and are now watching it again. My daughter enjoy it a lot and says ""Jojo y Lulu!"" to request the dvd. It gets a little annoying for me but she seems to love it. The characters do a lot of repeating and the verb demonstrations are pretty good.",1469145600,,417,4.358974358974359
8497299,5,B006G1WVD6,Bought this after reading various articles.  Our girls have watched it many time and ask for it.  It is a good way to let your child hear another language and figure out how common objects are referred to in Spanish.  They occasionally also repeat what is being said.,1466640000,,267,4.520833333333333
8497300,3,B006G1WVD6,"Our family has enjoyed the DVDs. They are for young children and are the starter set. I hope to get the seconds set that should be coming out soon. I wish that each video had a few more words included, but it is a good place to start a new language!",1432080000,2,249,3.9019607843137254
8497301,5,B006G1WVD6,Love the DVDs. They are entertaining and my 2 year old is quickly picking up new words. I highly recommend Early Lingo.,1424217600,,119,4.454545454545454
8497302,5,B006G1WVD6,"My daughter watches this intently and repeats the words that are said.  Not only does the program show the picture, but also the word in spanish, along with saying it.  My husband and I are also using this to learn our Spanish!",1416009600,2,227,4.380952380952381
8497303,1,B006G1WVD6,"I usually don't write reviews, but since there are really none out there right now I thought I'd try and save you the time and money.  I bought this DVD set for my 15 month old...very disappointed!  I only opened the first DVD and that's all I needed...I'm returning the item ASAP.  The overall quality was horrible!  Example...a little girl is holding a ball (pelota) and her nails have chipped polish.  While this may not seem like a big deal...it's just an example of the poor quality of this DVD.  The sound is horrible and the overall quality is just very disappointing.  My son did get excited when he saw the man in the park holding a bunch of balloons (to teach color), but that's about it.  I was thinking it was going to be cartoon characters (based off the monkey on the cover), but turns out it is actually people at an actual park.  I could get better results if I took my video camera to the park and filmed my family speaking Spanish!",1400457600,5,949,4.377142857142857
