8534328,3,B0091KS7LY,Only 4 of the 10 episodes? ESPN did the exact same thing with the 30 for 30 series by rushing a Volume 1 instead of doing the whole series originally..... Strange marketing from such a great company..... This will be an easy 5-star review whenever they release the full product; until then I would hold off on this.,1386979200,2,315,4.448275862068965
