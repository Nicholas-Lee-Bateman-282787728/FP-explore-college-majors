A contemporary of Cezanne, Degas, Monet, Renoir and others, Gustave was born into a wealthy family, and he was able to collect paintings of those who took the name of ""impressionists.""

This collection was given to the French government after his death and forms the core collection in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. The significance of Caillebotte's influence on Art wasn't completely understood until the first half of the 20th century.  Interestingly,  his style had been influenced by photography, and the making of movies followed his death at age 45.  During that brief life he completed 450 of his own works.

He was the moving force in staging the early showings of Impressionist paintings, an undertaking that took both courage and perseverance.  It is not a bad thing to make comparisons and to have heroes.  Many young people today do not play an active role in launching their own futures - Gustave Caillebotte may not be  everyone's choice of mentor but having young people study this film might stir a desire to commit to worthwhile goals.

The choices of piano and vocal music in the film are appropriate to that time in art history, and the excellent editing helps to showcase the paintings and points being made in the script.  mcHaiku suggests this vhs film as a gift for high school libraries, but not before you enjoy watching it yourself.",1185235200,,1742,4.877551020408164

For the collector of country history, this DVD is a must to own. Conway does IT'S ONLY MAKE BELIEVE - and the shiver's run down your back !

8218616,4,6301148371,"Pikes Peak Country with Colorado Springs is a nice video.  However, I fould it difficult to categorize.  Most of the video seemed more like an economical history lesson than a travel video. Whitle all the major tourist  attractions in and near the Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs area are  highlighted, too much time is spent outlining the old gold rush booms of  Colorado.  The presentation on the Garden of The Gods State Park and Seven  Falls is beautiful and informative. More attention could have been spent on  what modern day Colorado Springs has to offer travelers.  If you are  interested in the history, as well as, travel opportunities of Colorado,  then this is the video for you!",945129600,3,697,4.871794871794871
