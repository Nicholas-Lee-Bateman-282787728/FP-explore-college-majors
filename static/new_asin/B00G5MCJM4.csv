8620927,3,B00G5MCJM4,"I am quite a fan of Eion Finn, and I have most of his DVDs. This practice does offer some interesting new moves, and the main focus is on the hips. There are some challenging sequences in this area, and 3 days after doing this practice for the first time, I am still sore! (This is a good sign for me, as I am in quite good shape). There is a lot of stretching in this practice, with some new stretching poses that I think Eion invented himself. There is an honesty about them--like they came from an inner place of how he felt that his body really wanted to move, and I could connect. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't very many arm balances (only one crow) or inversions. Though there were definitely some challenging elements, but I kind of felt like the ""meat"" of the practice was somehow missing. Some of the sequences were similar to those on his other DVDs, like the core section. It was all filmed outdoors, but it wasn't as green as I would have liked--mainly ocean shots, often with some dry brush around. There were some mountain scenes, but often it was hard to see the poses too well for the sunshine. I would have liked to see the cameras closer up, like in Yoga for Happiness. Though there are three routines, they are just shorter versions of the same practice, as in a number of his other DVDs, which is still a let down after the Blissology series. I also am NOT a huge fan of Eion's being shirtless in all the shots--I don't need to look at his chest! I do think I will get some use out of this disc, but I like his first Blissology series and Yoga for Happiness more, placing this DVD in 3rd place of my Eion Finn DVDs.",1390435200,12,1649,4.238095238095238
8620928,5,B00G5MCJM4,"As always, I can't be happier with Eoin Finn's Yoga. This new dvd is no exception. Wonderful scenery, excellent cueing, and great alighment tips from one of the most 'chill' Yoga instructors I've ever encountered. A+++. If you like Eoin, you'll love this. If you're new to Eoin, still recommend. There are 3 lovely practices each with challenge and room to grow. Beginners may struggle, but Intermediate and up will do fine.",1388966400,6,424,4.902777777777778
