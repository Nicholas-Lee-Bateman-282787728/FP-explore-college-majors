8341783,5,B001TK29ZY,"HH2W Ken Harsh's lectures on DVD are a pure treasure, one which I will hand down to my children and grandchildren.  Viewing this lecture on DVD is absolutely wonderful it's just like being at one of his lectures.  The great part is you can stop it, write down important bits then go on.  It's great to just review it especially in the winter months before I can catch one of his lectures! I would highly recommend this DVD and his others.  It's a collection worth it's weight in gold! I'm actually going to invite a few friends over and have a viewing party with fellow stone lovers. Thank You Ken!",1267660800,,598,4.409090909090909
