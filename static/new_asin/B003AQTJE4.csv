8393139,3,B003AQTJE4,"Human hunting movies have been around since the early days of film. Like any genre there are some that are better than others. This eminently watchable movie does a lot right, but some bad decisions keep it from being above the fray.

Here's the scoop. Sean is a young punk in London. His sister spends more than she makes and is now in debt to a shark for 12K. Her only way to erase the debt is to mule some drugs for him. Sean is approached by a businessman and offered one thousand dollars and a key to a locker where there is another eleven thousand waiting for him. All he needs to do is ""hide"" until 9:00 a.m. the next morning. He needs to help sis so he agrees. During the game he realizes that being found means being dead so, of course, he needs to outwit his pursuer.

Unlike previous versions of this scenario, this is set in urban surroundings. One would think Sean should ace this without even breaking a sweat. But his pursuer has done a lot of work up front so Sean's options become limited. The bad guy (played by Dugray Scott) is a wealthy financier. He lives alone and seems to despise pretty much everyone beneath him. They even give him a protracted ""agent Johnson"" type soliloquy concerning his disdain for most humans. On his end he's interviewing a guy for a position in the firm. Said imterviewee is with him on the hunt because Dugray wants to see how far this guy will go to succeed. There are a lot of nifty twists and turns, but other things happen that are counter-intuitive so it drags things down. I started losing interest during the second act but, something crucial happens that drew me back in. Now the third act starts and I'm back into it.

The directing and cutting are generally decent. The acting is Okay with Scott being the stand-out. The music is good. It doesn't slap you around, it merely underscores the action. Some of the dialogue is clunky as is the way a few scenes are written. This is a good watch, it just could have been better.",1372464000,,1982,4.395095367847412

8393141,2,B003AQTJE4,"Sean Macdonald (James Anthony Pearson) needs money. He is a teenager living in a tough neighborhood in Edinburgh, and his sister Alice (Liz White) is heavily in debt, 12,000 pounds in all. That's when Sean is offered a proposal from two wealthy businessmen Alistair (Dougray Scott) and Jamie (Alastair Mackenzie) in the restroom of a fancy restaurant. Their offer is strange, but attractive.

The rule of the ""game"" is simple. If Sean can ""hide"" for the twelve hours beginning from today's 9 p.m., Sean wins the game and gets the money - money enough to pay back his sister's debt. Sean agrees, but soon he learns that the game is much deadlier than he imagined.

""New Town Killers"" opens promisingly with stylish opening credits and decent acting from the leading actors, but soon things start to look too silly. Though I cannot reveal the details of Sean's predicaments, I have to say he is not a very smart kid. The story is not set in some deserted island or uninhabited mountains, so there are so many options he can take (with cash in hand), which somehow he ignores all.

The film wants to say something about moral and society (the surname of the ""baddie"" is Raskolnikov), but it is not clear what it is. As a suspense movie ""New Town Killers"" is not effective, either. It uses conventions of the thriller of this type, thrillers featuring the hunter(s) and the hunted like ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" but the 100-minute film by writer and director Richard Jobson loses steam pretty early on, before reaching its disappointing conclusion.",1295308800,,1545,4.8007518796992485
8393142,4,B003AQTJE4,"""New Town Killers""(2009) is directed by Richard Jobson (The Purifiers). The movie is about two business men, Alistair (Dougray Scott),and Jamie (Alastair Mackenzie), who play horrible games with people from the fringes of society. Their target in the film is Sean Macdonald (Pearson), a teenager who lives with his sister on the outskirts of Edinburgh. She's in debt, and Sean agrees to play the game proposed by these business men in exchange for money. Not until it is too late does he realize that he has gotten involved in a macabre game where his life and those around him are in jeopardy. This is a taut thriller that keeps one hooked all the way through.

Interestingly, Richard Jobson was a member of the Skids back in 1979. The theme song, ""New Town Killers"", marks Richard Jobson's first official song writing in over 15 years.",1261699200,,837,4.8125
