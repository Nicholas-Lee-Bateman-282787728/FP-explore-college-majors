42302,1,0783111037,"Read the book, but DO NOT BUY THIS TRAVESTY! Worse than a made for TV oversimplification, this HBO film completely distorts and actually REVERSES essential facts of the true, exciting and important story detailed in the book upon which it is based (St. Martin's Press, 1997). Anyone with respect for the history of submarines and submariners should avoid this poor ""dramatization."" It isn't even a ""taut thriller,"" as People Magazine was quoted as saying. It's just a boring whitewash of the actual events. Besides failing to show that an irresponsible cowboy US Submarine Commander (James Von Suskil of the USS AUGUSTA, the man and the ship both cowardly renamed in this low-budget stinker) recklessly caused the accident, they depicted the Russian Captian receiving a hero's welcome when he returned to the USSR, when in truth he was tragically court-martialed and imprisoned after taking necessary steps to save his crew and the eastern seaboard of the US! Why do people make movies like this, and why do actors like Max Von Sydow and Martin Sheen participate in covering up the misdeeds of a reckless US sub commander and the depraved indifference and cruelty of the Soviet Navy toward its own sailors. The simple truth of the book would have been far more exciting and enlightening. Shame on everyone associated with this little piece of anti-history!",997488000,15,1356,5.058035714285714
42373,3,0783111037,Strickly for submarine movie fans. About 31/2 stars. Not as good as Phantom with Ed Harris & David Duchovny. Because Martin Sheen's performance as the American skipjack class attack submarine captain is weak. Example Scott Glen nailed his role as the Los Angeles class captain in The Search for Red October. So it's OK but don't expect too much.,1441497600,,345,4.864406779661017
42374,5,0783111037,Martin Sheen played the American Sub Captain perfectly and the  picture was a great cold war story.,1438819200,,99,4.823529411764706

42378,4,0783111037,"Strangely interesting movie. Wasn't widely viewed when it came out. If you like Das Boot, U-571 etc, you'll like this one.",1386460800,,122,4.857142857142857
42379,5,0783111037,"If the Red October had been a normal sub, it would have positioned itself off the American coast as a form of intimidation while cruising around with it's missiles targeted.  The Dallas would have pursued it as quietly as possible to show that we knew they were there, and could take them out at the last minute if need be.

In this scenario, the K-219 is pursued by the ""Aurora"" which slides into it's baffles.  The subs go silent to wait each other out, but the Soviet captain performs a crazy Ivan to bring himself about on his pursuer.  The subs lose exact track of each other, and a glancing blow leads to a leak in one missile silo, the resulting gas expansion forcing the Russian to the surface to attempt a venting before it loses the missile, or worse.

Despite any conflict with actual events, fans of submariner films will find this interesting and suspenseful.",1383523200,2,872,4.564102564102564
42380,4,0783111037,I know this movie well from the vhs days. Rutger Hauer is the star of this movie. I don't think anyone else could have played his role with such believe ability as he did. If you want to see him in another great role get a copy of The Hitcher. Not that lousy remake they did a couple of years ago but the original that he stars in. It's a great thriller movie. I don't mean lots of blood & gore but a keep you on the edge of your seat kind of movie such as this one. This movie is also based on an actual event during the Cold War even though the U.S. denies it ever happened.,1382918400,,576,3.8487394957983194
42381,5,0783111037,"if anyone has ever been to sea then watching this movie just lets you experience what the Russians

  aboard the k-19 submarine went through in real life. Unbelievable courage in the face of overwhelming

  adversity.  Once the  reactor cooling system was damaged it took everything they had to contain the disaster

  and escape with their sub in tact and their lives.  Rutger Hauer puts on a very realistic performance as

  the skipper of the Russian Sub.  Highly recommend this movie.",1375833600,,488,4.9125
42382,3,0783111037,"Hostile Waters is based on an actual incident, my brother was a sonarman aboard the USS Augusta when this happened. The book is far better than the movie as its more detailed. However, the story was told more from the Russian side as the Augusta crew were forbidden to discuss the matter in any form, and U.S Navy denied the incident completely. I read the book and purchased the movie simply because I knew my brother was there, after reading the book I was incredibly grateful just to still have a baby brother. It could have turned out very differently for him. He has acknowledged the incident was real, he did years ago, he finally read the book and all he could say was that the story described the Capt. and the actions he took and ordered as extremely accurate.",1374537600,,769,4.5
42433,5,0783111037,"This was an HBO movie about a true story of a Russian sub that hits an
American sub and damages the ship and can't be repaired. next is a chess
game between the americans and Russians as to who will sink the ship first.
A really good well made movie.",1373673600,,250,4.02
42434,5,0783111037,"Husband says it's the movie he's been seeking for some time.  Problem with remembering name.  He did remember the actor(s) and and cover shot however.  Disc plays without issue and is a clean, crisp copy.  Worth the outlay for any Rutger Hauer fans out there.",1371254400,,259,4.688888888888889
42435,3,0783111037,I loved this movie which is based on an actual event.  It's told principally from the Soviet point of view and you see that they're just like us.,1357862400,,145,4.178571428571429
42436,4,0783111037,"This is an above average film. Well acted and directed. Interesting topic. Well rounded story and cast. Not quite a nail-biter, but close. Well worth viewing for Rutger Hauer fans.",1353110400,,180,5.033333333333333
42437,5,0783111037,"I love movies like this. I like submarine movies for one, add to the fact that's based on a real story makes it better. Throw in Martin Sheen and Rutger Hauer and it's a complete win.",1283126400,,183,4.111111111111111
42438,4,0783111037,"Although not 100% accurate, the film is a must to have for the cold-war, or submarine, interested individual. I would like to recommend the book ""Hostile Waters"", by Peter Huchthausen, Igor Kurdin , and Alan White, which gives a very accurate and exiting description of the actual events.",1181606400,,288,5.020833333333333
42439,4,0783111037,"I can't speak to the historical accuracy of the events depicted but the staging seemed very realistic and plausable.  Considering they had to make this film on a ""TV Movie"" budget, I think they did quite well.  Rutger Hauer gives an excellent performance as the Russian submarine captain.  If you liked Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October, then you should add Hostile Waters to your library of under water drama, too.",1142380800,10,419,4.791666666666667
42440,3,0783111037,"I was interested throughout the movie. I thought it was going to be worse. I got it, like many, because of Dominic Monaghan. Though he's not in it much, he's always around. He has one line, but from the review I read I thought that was it. He's actually in it more than you would think! It's a good movie none the less. Ahh go away + buy it!",1103760000,3,341,3.9565217391304346
42441,3,0783111037,"I ordered this DVD for Dominic Monaghan's performance.  He is not in it very much, at all, but this was an okay movie.

It is the story of a US sub and a USSR sub involved in an accident which the US gov't. denied ever happened.

Suddenly the USSR's sub is in danger of blowing up the Eastern Seaboard of the US, but they have a limited amount of time and oxygen.

The rest of the movie is their attempt to save themselves and shut off the reactors so the nuclear bombs don't explode.

The acting is so-so; I would expect better from Sheen and Hauer.  I can imagine that this was just a little film that they did in their downtime.

Dom, as Sasha, is good considering he has like, 3 lines.  As always, his facial expressions and eyes convey more than the average actor.

If you are a Dom fan, there's no harm in getting this movie.  I've only watched it once, whereas I have watched ""Hetty"" at least 5 times all the way through.  Not a movie worthy of an award, it's a pretty interesting flick.",1096675200,5,994,4.2063492063492065
42442,2,0783111037,"Little more than a serviceable introduction to the historical proceedings. Wooden acting all round. In fact, Sheen looks like he's sleepwalking (or punchdrunk) through the thing. Still, Hauer does manage to conjure some sympathy as the Russian captain who does his best to save all his men, though, regardless of what he does, he can't win back home with the Soviet officials. Otherwise, there are handful of interesting insights into submarine culture--if what we're seeing is an accurate portrayal.
Overall, Hostile Waters the feel of a mediocre (to bad) TV movie (which I'm assuming it isn't), including some particularly unconvincing special effects--to the extent that, though this was made in 1997, I would've guessed '87. It just looks that dated. Only Hauer and Sheen's haggard appearances are any clue that it was made later.",1030924800,9,834,5.231343283582089

7789991,3,0783111037,"I liked the movie, but wondered why they had Sheen play the American Sub Captain as timid and less capable than his EO.  It's a British movie.

Everyone's acting was lifeless and the storyline nearly unrecognizeable. A page turner morphs into a watch-checker. (""Is it almost over?"") Don't do this to yourself.

The movie would dissuade anyone from reading the book, which would be a real shame. It's a seriously 5-star book.",1447200000,,390,4.82089552238806
