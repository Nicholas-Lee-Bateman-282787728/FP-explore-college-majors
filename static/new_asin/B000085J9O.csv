7979218,4,B000085J9O,"I became a huge fan of Secretariat as a 10 year old in June 1973 when I watched him win the Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths to become the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years.  Even to this day, 30 years later, watching that race gives me the chills.  An absolutely perfect performance at the perfect time.
I had previously purchased a prior version of this video, which reflected a one-hour documentary that was aired around 1990.  It gave a good summary of Secretariat's life with interviews with his owner Penny Chenery, trainer Lucien Laurin and jockey Ron Turcotte and even the veterinarian who looked after him when he passed away from laminitis in 1989.
The video was reissued to coincide with Ms. Chenery's plan to have a bronze statue of Secretariat made (proceeds from the sale went to the fund).  The 1990 program is included as well as a documentary that was done in conjunction with Secretariat's last race in Canada.  Also included are start to finish videos of almost all of Secretariat's 21 races (the only missing one, I believe is his race at Arlington Park in Chicago after he won the Triple Crown).  Some of the races contain the track announcer's call, others have commentary from Lucien Laurin and a couple have no audio at all, just the video (fortunately, you can find Big Red fairly easy with his checkered hood).
All in all, it's about 100 minutes of Secretariat.  The price is fairly steep and for it, it would have been nice for the program to be available in DVD format, but if you are a fan, it is a nice momento of the greatest horse of the 20th century.",1067299200,36,1583,4.533333333333333
