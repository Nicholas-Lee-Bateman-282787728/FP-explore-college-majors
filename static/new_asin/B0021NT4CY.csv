8349355,4,B0021NT4CY,"This is the fourth or fifth full-length documentary on Errol Flynn. It's not the best, but it ain't bad.  Unknown until his 1935 Warner Bros. ""Captain Blood(which made him a superstar over-night)"", Errol Flynn spent his way through millions of dollars and died penniless(at age 50) next to his 17-year-old girlfriend. ""Tasmanian Devil: Fast and Furious Life of Errol Flynn"" is narrated by Christopher Lee, who acted with Flynn in four movies. Lee relates the public and private life of the man who's private life eclipsed any adventure he ever portrayed in the movies. The DVD remembers Flynn's bitter, sad relationship with his mother; resentment would lead to three future failed marriages. Dalliances with under-age women, alcohol, and morphine didn't help. Errol Flynn's four children were three daughters and son Sean Flynn, a movie actor who disappeared as a photo-journalist in Vietnam in 1972. Daughter Rory Flynn helped produce this movie; for her,and her sister, a tribute, perhaps, to a father they really loved. As in the Turner documentary(quite good), there are excerpts from Errol Flynn's 1937 Lux Radio interviews. A bounty of DVD extras include interviews with Rory Flynn, Beverly Aadland(his last girlfriend), and more. There are also featurettes on Flynn in Cuba, Flynn and the Zaca(his yacht), two radio plays, photos, and a lovely short, ""The Baron of Mulholland(his former Hollywood ranch-home..The land is now owned by Jack Nicholson. The original house has been demolished.)"". Although available in the US on the internet, ""Tasmanian Devil"" DVD is a PAL Region 2 release, and will not play on standard American DVD players.....""Errol, have you been wronged?""....""No. No. I contributed to it...I've had a hell of a lot of fun in life. And I loved every minute of it....""",1400803200,2,1793,5.204152249134948
8349356,4,B0021NT4CY,"This well made documentary on the life of Errol Flynn provides a good overview of the life and career of the Australian born actor. Don't expect too much detail on Flynn's films though - narrator Christopher Lee tells us his films were the least interesting thing about him. Covered are Flynn's early years in Australia and New Guinea, his rapid rise to stardom, his trip to war-torn Spain, his wives, womanizing and rape trial, his love of the ocean and yacht the Zaca, his home on Mulholland Drive, his gradual career and health decline, and his visit to Cuba to interview Fidel Castro.

Interviewed for this documentary are daughters Deidre and Rory Flynn, Vincent Sherman (director of Flynn's ""Adventures of Don Juan""), Beverly Aadland (Flynn's teenage girlfriend at the time of his death), a former school classmate, biographers and film historians, who all provide fascinating insights into the Hollywood star's life and times. Some areas of Flynn's life are covered in reasonable detail, particularly his boyhood years and time in Cuba, while his three marriages, children and rape trial are quickly glossed over, and his brief pre-Hollywood theatre and film career in England is not even mentioned. At 59 minutes the documentary feels a bit too condensed, however it is well rounded by some decent supplementary material. The extras include:-

1. Additional interviews with Christopher Lee (7.19), Rory Flynn (2.44), Beverly Aadland (5.19), Luke Flynn, grandson of Flynn and Patrice Wymore (1.50) and Vincent Sherman (5.07).
2. Errol Flynn in Cuba - featurette (8.23)
3. Errol and the Zaca - featurette (6.41)
4. Errol and the Gulf Screen Guild Theatre - two 30 minute radio plays from the 1940s: ""Allergic To Ladies"" (Flynn with Alan Hale & Jane Wyman) and ""Mrs and Mrs Smith"" (Flynn with Lana Turner)
5. Photo Gallery and Family - 40 photos from Flynn's film career and 17 family photos
6. Baron of Mulholland - promoting Rory Flynn's book (3.58)
7. Filmography - a list of Flynn's film work

The 2005 documentary ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn"" covers the subject more comprehensively in around 85 minutes but this alternative, made in 2006 by Film Finance Corporation Australia, is recommended for its worthwhile additional material.",1313971200,8,2245,5.095108695652174
8349357,4,B0021NT4CY,"This is one of the most recent offerings on Errol Flynn. I am pleased that so many accounts of Flynn have been gathered, as he is a subject that offers so much; characterised by his perpetual ""devil may care"" attitude. I was particularly pleased that Beverly Aadland was dealt a fairer hand in this documentary. The fact that Aadland was a primary contributor was a thoughtful gesture. With the passing of Aadland on January 5, 2010 this work has extra significance. Errol's first and fourth child Sean Flynn and Arnella Flynn were not adequately addressed in this documentary, and Errol's two grandsons were not included. The special features has a few minutes of Luke Flynn though. I found it pleasing that there was some extracts from the Australian film ""Flynn"" and that the closing credits featured Australian Crawl's classic song ""Errol"".
