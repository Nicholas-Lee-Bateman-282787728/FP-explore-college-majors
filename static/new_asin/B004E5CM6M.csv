8426521,5,B004E5CM6M,"If you're a swing dancer (or just someone who want's to be able to dance to slower tunes, say, under 120 bpm) who's lookin' get into the world of slow dancing, this is the item for you! I've been Lindy Hopping rather aggressively for 4 years now and have just entered the world of competitive Balboa dancing. But, have never really spent that much time in the slow side of things. (I'm used to thinkin' that 160 bpm is ""chill"".)

I found the data on this disc to be a great start to a new way of dancing for me. Not for those who are battle-hardened in the ways of the Blues. But, if you're new, it's a fantastic start. :)",1457481600,,622,4.140495867768595
8426522,1,B004E5CM6M,"I like Daniel Newsome - he usually does a good job explaining the dances he covers - in depth. This DVD, however, teaches mostly swing steps, patterns, and moves - and not blues dancing at all. No offense, but it just doesn't deliver the ""blues goods."" The feel of the dance is lacking, the patterns covered are mostly standard beginning and intermediate Lindy, and, frankly, there was very little here that even looked like blues dancing. Not much drag, not much pause, not much hesitation - but lots of ""cranking,"" ""in and outs,"" ""cross overs/ sloppy ochos, and outright ""swing"" moves (The Apache? Really?) that could be (and were in this video) slowed down to imitate ""blues."" Sorry, but not sold on most of this content being very bluesy. Get Dan's Lindy DVDS, which are great, and watch some real drag blues on youtube. Then combine both and you'll be a better dancer than this DVD can get you up to no matter how often you watch it. No cigar.",1388102400,6,948,4.58235294117647
8426523,5,B004E5CM6M,"Dan just makes learning so much fun in all of these videos.  I have purchased several Motion Lifestyle series.  I keep coming back because they are formatted so well, and so easy to follow.  I get excited everytime I have one coming in the mail.",1324339200,,245,4.4
8426524,5,B004E5CM6M,"It's really easy for a beginner to use this tape. I've used it to teach a few friends. It's been fun! Daniel is great (as always) and Kelly Porter was a great adition. The thing I like the most is that they both seemed to really know their history and understand what makes blues so great.

I can't recommend getting into this style of dance enough. It's fun, sexy, and always looks great on the dance floor!

Great to see Daniel teaching the blues! :)",1307577600,,452,4.305882352941176
8426525,5,B004E5CM6M,I absolutely loved the dvd. I am a intermediate lindy dancer but i was a total beginner when it came to blues. This dvd has over 2 hours of instruction and plenty of moves to learn. This dvd not only teaches you the basics but some really cool moves that i absolutely love doing. I highly skipping though the dvd so you can see what everymove looks like and learn the basics with a few advanced moves to touch up your dancing. Best of luck.,1303344000,,440,4.188235294117647
