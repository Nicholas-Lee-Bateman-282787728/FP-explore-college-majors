  All the bad boys of film are in this film!
We need more films like this all heavey hitters in one movie and it works! No egos it looks like it was fun to make
highly recommend !",1002585600,2,191,3.75
1063413,5,6305742197,"This movie has moved into my top ten favorites of all time. What a hidden treasure! This movie must have lacked any public relations effort whatsoever, because it is just fantastic. You would be hard pressed to find a better group of character actors performing their craft at a higher level. The characters were true to life and the storyline was brilliant, funny, and at times, very moving. If you have a pulse and enjoy quality, get this movie! I would like to single out one or two actor's and talk about their performances, but that would not be fair to the rest of the cast. Just an awesome movie!!",998611200,11,604,4.5
1063414,5,6305742197,"The cast of this movie intrigued me so I felt it worth my time to view.  Stagliano was not a director with whose work I was familiar but his  masterful direction of this packed cast of stars was incredible! The themes  in this movie, both overt and gently flowing under the surface are enough  to keep you mind busy for weeks after viewing! Belushi and Holbrook are  stunning and Perry begins to show his depth and ability. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND  THIS MOVIE!!",962668800,13,456,4.5
1063415,4,6305742197,"I live in Easton, PA where a lot of this movie was shot.  We don't get much publicity in this small town and it was nice to have a film shot downtown.  I was dissapointed that the movie was not released in theatres.  It had an all-star cast and the story was very good.  I hope more movies  are made in this town.  If anyone is thinking of purchasing this title, I  urge you to.  You will not be let down.  Again, this was a brilliant movie  and it gave the town of Easton a little piece of Hollywood.",962496000,,501,3.9696969696969697
1063416,4,6305742197,This is a very touching movie including high acting level scenes. The cast is excellent with a particular mention to Michael Madsen who is remarkable. Namely in a wonderful scene with his sister Virginia Madsen. The Florentine  is a MUST SEE.,956534400,5,242,4.902439024390244
1063417,4,6305742197,"Nice film about small town PA. I would have liked to see a little more depth to the characters, but the cast did a fine job.
Very good work from Luke Perry! His character's despiration showed well. Also nice job by  Belushi.
Rent this movie now and buy it when the price comes down.",954892800,,282,4.222222222222222

Seller is #1 in my book.",1440547200,,68,4.75
7893466,5,6305742197,Great film and what a cast.,1406332800,,27,3.6666666666666665
7893467,1,6305742197,This movie came in a sealed broken case. The DVD was sliding all around getting scratched inside the case. Not at all happy with the purchase.,1316908800,,142,4.5
7893468,5,6305742197,"Such a great movie.  It's true that this movie is not held together by a great story but more by the people that make up the story.  Meaning, that it's about a small town (in PA - notice all the Yuenling) and how a group of friends remember the past, get stuck in the stuck, and in some instances move on from the past.  Introduced to this movie by the sister of the director, it's been a favorite of mine for years.  If you like this movie, a movie called Beautiful Girls is in the similar vein.  Also had the chance to meet Matthew Ryan (through the director's sister) soon after this movie was made.  Ryan's songs make up a good portion of the soundtrack.  I become a big fan of his music through this movie soundtrack.  His somewhat Dylanesque vocals accompany this movie perfectly.",1272067200,,786,4.372413793103449
7893469,4,6305742197,"This film is driven by quiet, yet powerful, performances.  This unit of actors delivers something very near perfection to me; they convey the trials and tribulations of the everyman in a totally realistic manner.  I really enjoyed seeing character guys like Penn, Sizemore, and Michael Madsen, given a larger canvas to work with, and they make the most of it.  There is a positive vibe underlying the struggles these people deal with, which is refreshing.  It's nice to see people recognize and grasp their chance at redemption.  This is just a great movie.",1263859200,,557,4.946236559139785
7893470,4,6305742197,"This is a slice of life as the film examines the lives of a dozen blue collar working people in Philadelphia who, in one manner or another, are tied to The Florentine Bar, a local hangout run by Whitey (Michael Madsen appearing, uncharacteristically, in white hair) who inherited the bar from his father. The cast is exceptional, and there are two breath-taking scenes in this film that should be taught in every acting school - one is a soliloquy by Hal Holbrook on the ""one who got away"" and the other is a quiet study of Mary Stuart Masterson as she listen to her busband (Chris Penn) tell her of his plans to reform himself. Brief but effective appearances from Virginia Madsen (always beautiful and effective), James Belushi (as a bad guy!) and Burt Young help to round out the ensemble cast.

Co-produced by Francis Ford Coppola and Nick Stagliano in 1999, the film is directed by Nick Stagliano. This is only Stagliano's second film (as producer or director) and the pace is slightly off center, and perhaps lit a little too darkly. But with a cast such as this, it's hard to make many mistakes, and the little vignettes with Holbrook and Madsen, Penn and Masterson, Tom Sizemore and James Belushi, and Jeremy Davies and Maeve Quinlan are priceless.",1249084800,2,1256,4.709090909090909
7893471,4,6305742197,"Not that this film needs any help from me but allow me to say, ""The Florentine"" is a superb example of a movie containing at least eight character studies - all executed by splendid actors - that boggles the imagination.  Take Tom Sizmore and James Belushi for example.  I can't recall a film in which either actor displays more humanity, more core, more inner feelings.  Sizemore's touching church scene with Michael Madsen, in which both characters must sort out some painful memories while agreeing to remain friends, is almost heartbreakingly poignant while Belushi's big swaggering sell of a character is nothing short of a tour de force.  But then the whole cast simply nails scene after scene as if we are privy to a perfectly performed, (if dated,) stage play, which I understand is the origin of this film.  And here is my major reservation, the all's well that ends well story line seasoned with so much salt of the earth brined away contemporary sensibilities leaving much of ""The Florentine"" playing as if from the 1930's complete with a Hal Holbrook stage manager-like character from Thorton Wilder's ""Our Town.""  But neat and a bit too tidy story or otherwise, this is, (to me,) an actor's film from first to last and with that in mind, I say ""The Florentine"" remains a joy to watch.",1243555200,2,1297,4.767857142857143
7893472,4,6305742197,"I spent the better part of a decade working in a bar that services a strong working-class neighborhood up here in Winnipeg, Canada. This little flick hits the nail right on the head. The tree-lined streets, the old houses becoming new homes to new people, the brownstone churches and schools, the characters, the stories. All fell into place rather nicely but the stereotypes and cliches were a bit much. I say now and for the record that not all working people are poor, dumb and desperate; and it's the ""desperate"" element getting played up-from movies like this to Springsteen songs-that bothers me. We seem to have a fascination in North America with the glorification of ""working-man plight"". I know guys who look like ten miles of bad road and have more money than God, yet dress and talk like a vagrant. And the worse off you are, the more ""respect"" you seem to demand. Balls. That plumber who was getting married will make a fortune with his trade if he plays his cards right. Madsen's bar could be profitable if he showed a little imagination. A certain romance is present in bar culture, but not in getting hammered all the time. There's usually a way out and diving into a bottle, extorting money or having a kid you neither want or need isn't it. I grow weary of this calibre of self-inflicted misery. I've seen enough of it.

Social commentary aside, yes, this is a fine little piece. Good acting, sharp dialogue and direction keep it going. I've always liked Sizemore's work and it's a shame he's screwed-up his personal life so much. And Hal Holbrook's gritty barfly/philosopher is a kind of ""Twain-esque"" sage himself, very much like the one Hal made his own years ago with his countless one-man shows of ""Mark Twain Tonight!"". Also, when I see a movie with good writing I check if it was based on a novel or play; and so this was (play). I used to do some acting at our local summer theatre festival and have a soft spot for the stage.

Take this movie on it's own merits; but that's all you should take away with you when the credits fade.",1167523200,3,2057,4.556756756756757
7893473,4,6305742197,"Told with that slow paced style so typical of the Forties films, it focuses on the lives and times of the people of a small town; his misfortunes and little triumphs. Virginia Madsen is lovable and worthy  cast makes the rest.",1122768000,,226,4.512195121951219
