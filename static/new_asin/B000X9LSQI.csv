I had a vague recollection of seeing this years ago on TV, although I don't think it was the original broadcast, it was a rebroadcast years later.  I remember it made me cry.  Weep. Other HBQ recordings have not had the same effect.  I am an atheist, again I don't know why I purchased this or why it is so moving.  However, it is.  I was so moved I was inspired to donate to a similar organization in my town.  As a defense attorney, I see how young peoples lives can be so easily ruined by a few bad decisions.  It is so nice to see young people just so happy and carefree while they sing.  Not sure I will ever look at it again but maybe when I'm feeling depressed about the future of the world I will look at it and cry again.  I hope all those boys are still singing somewhere--or can at least feel as free as they looked singing all those years ago.",1371427200,,935,4.032608695652174
8227415,5,B000X9LSQI,"I spent ages online trying to find a DVD of the Harlem Boys' Choir. I finally fell on this documentary from the Nightline series. I was looking for a top notch, internationally renown boys' choir to motivate my middle school chorus boys, with the goal of getting them to stay in chorus through high school. This video aired one Christmas Eve, hence the holiday musical theme. It captivated not only my boys, but all my six through eighth grade chorus students. They were absolutely silent as they followed the boys through a typical school day, a concert road trip, and various concert segments. The video features one special young boy with outstanding talent, and from him we learn just how disciplined, hard working, and motivated these boys must be to succeed in this choir, as well as in the choir school that they attend as their public school. I highly recommend this DVD to all middle school choral directors! It will inspire you as well as your students!",1223769600,7,963,4.738095238095238
