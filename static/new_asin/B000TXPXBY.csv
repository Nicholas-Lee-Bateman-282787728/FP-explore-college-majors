2910880,5,B000TXPXBY,"Another winner with my girls.  It's about Bratz Babyz and they are super!!
They've watched it multiple times.  You think it would get old after so many times...but it will end and they want to watch it again.",1206921600,6,208,4.447368421052632
2910881,3,B000TXPXBY,"The Bratz get computer animated in this adventure film. After their sister accidentally gives the Bratz super powers, the girls must adapt to their new hero personalities. But as soon as they get used to the change, aliens return to earth and rob them of their powers.",1203638400,,268,4.723404255319149
2910892,1,B000TXPXBY,Scary for a 6 year old. Baby aliens with monster faces.,1408233600,2,55,4.090909090909091
2910893,4,B000TXPXBY,Very cute,1404777600,,9,4.0
2910894,1,B000TXPXBY,Felt it was very boring for my grandaughter and she did not care for it either. Characters were actually annoying.,1403654400,3,114,4.75
2910895,4,B000TXPXBY,"My Granddaughter and I are extremely happy the price was right ,and every one was so helpful in getting the movies to us even though they were sent to the wrong address and I did not have to pay anymore.
Thanks",1399420800,,210,4.146341463414634
2910896,1,B000TXPXBY,"The Bratz are terrible, but for some reason my daughter wants to watch them.  I will be steering her towards other more appropriate shows.",1397347200,2,138,4.75
2910897,1,B000TXPXBY,This is one of the worst movies ever. We will not be watching another again. This is not good for kids.,1395273600,,103,3.9523809523809526
2910898,1,B000TXPXBY,"Don't waste your time (or your kids). This was just the worst cartoon I have ever had to sit with my daughter and watch. The animation was extremely terrible, as if a high schooler did it. Actually, I think a high schooler would have done better!",1394582400,,246,4.369565217391305
2910899,3,B000TXPXBY,Written very poorly. I don't know who writes the dialogue for this but it's awful. I guess this is where creators who aren't good enough for Disney end up.,1392940800,,155,4.379310344827586
2910900,3,B000TXPXBY,"Vapid and painful, a true torture to watch, but the kids liked it. Turn it on and leave the room.",1392768000,3,97,3.9
2910901,5,B000TXPXBY,It nice for my grand child to find cartoon  or shows that are on TV. She really like this show so please continue to put good show  on prime! That the the reason I keep prime for to watch movie.,1392681600,,194,3.825
2910912,1,B000TXPXBY,Horrible... just watch the first 30 seconds and see for yourself.  Need to figure out parental guides settings so none of these moves will show up,1392249600,,146,4.615384615384615
2910913,4,B000TXPXBY,"My goddaughter found it educational and it kept her attention.
Better than some of the foolishiness on TV kids watch.",1391472000,,117,4.9
2910914,5,B000TXPXBY,"I as a grandmother don't understand the fascination with this movie, but it kept our granddaughters entertained so I will say it is a keeper.",1390867200,,141,4.68
2910915,4,B000TXPXBY,My five and four year-old cousins could not get their eyes of this show. The valley girl personality of the characters were a bit much and what was up with the silky hair (lol smh)?But the show is for kids so I rated it accordingly.,1390521600,,232,4.177777777777778
2910916,1,B000TXPXBY,"Don't waste your time.  The babies are decked out in hooker hair and makeup, and while I'm not easily offended, the babies' outfits/hair made me a little uncomfortable and not really what I want my daughter watching.  They look cute on the cover, but the movie itself looks nothing like that. The animation is really bad, cheesy and cheap.  I wish I could give 0 stars.",1390348800,2,369,4.5606060606060606
2910917,5,B000TXPXBY,I loved it so much like i can't believe hat this is the only one that i like didn't see. I wish that I would've seen it sooner,1389052800,2,126,3.5357142857142856

2910919,1,B000TXPXBY,"I don't usually consider myself a prudish person, but this was ridiculously terrible.  These ""babies"" dress like street-walkers and there was not one ounce of content that could redeem this movie.",1388361600,5,196,5.32258064516129
2910920,1,B000TXPXBY,Ugly movie My grandchild picked it. I am really disappointed with it. The coiors and story represent  an adult theme.,1382054400,4,117,4.85

2910932,4,B000TXPXBY,"I thought it was a cute movie for little kids.  Nothing great, but my granddaughter loved it.  She may want to watch it again, but it's not like the Disney or Pixar movies by any means.  It's just a cute cartoon movie.",1379635200,,218,4.142857142857143

2910934,1,B000TXPXBY,"Their attitudes, dress, and well all of it really is not something I would let my 7 year old watch again. There's really not much else to say, if you value what your child watches and realize it affects their thinking then this isn't the show for you.",1376092800,4,251,4.25
2910935,5,B000TXPXBY,I have not watched this show but my 6 yr old daughter has watched it many times.  So I am guessing for the age group it is a good movie.,1360800000,2,136,3.533333333333333
2910936,1,B000TXPXBY,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.  We love the Bratz movies, but this one is just awful.  The animation is terrible and very cheap looking and the story is just dumb.  Don't waste your money or your time....bad, bad movie.",1351296000,2,227,4.232558139534884

2910941,4,B000TXPXBY,"Cute enough. My 2 year old enjoys it though it doesn't keep her captivated all the way through. There are dry parts she drifts away from but otherwise, not bad. I bought mine at Target for 7.50.",1222992000,,194,4.27027027027027
