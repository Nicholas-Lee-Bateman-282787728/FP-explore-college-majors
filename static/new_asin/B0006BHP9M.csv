2181790,4,B0006BHP9M,"I recently bought this DVD for a Christmas party, primarily for the ""fireplace"" scene. Before purchasing, I checked various other fireplace DVDs (Ambient Fire, Virtual Flames etc). The reviews for this DVD convinced me to purchase it.

The image quality (which received poor reviews on other DVDs) is very good. The fireplace scene is realistic, complete with popping and crackling sound effects. The lava lamp and goldfish scenes are good also. The microwave scene (revolving pizza) is the least impressive.

The downside is that with 20 different scenes on the DVD, each scene is very short. The fireplace scene is only 5 minutes in duration, for example. Each scene auto-repeats but (on my DVD player, at least) the pause when a scene repeats is noticeable if you are paying attention.

I would rate this 5 stars if it had only 4-5 scenes, each lasting 20 minutes, rather than 20 short scenes.",1134691200,10,896,4.920529801324503
2181791,5,B0006BHP9M,"I'm not sure which is more amusing. This DVD, or my cat Meesa watching the lava lamp bubble and trying to bat and bite the bubbles as they appear. She loves watching the fish disappear and appear and is especially taken with the floating hearts. The music is romantic and the pink hearts float upwards in a romantic dream.

We first noticed Meesa's fascination with the computer screen when she sat transfixed by the Amazon IMAX movie and since then I've been finding amusing things for her to watch. Although she does wonder why the sounds are coming from the stereo.

One of her favorites is the fireplace that has realistic sounds as if you were in a castle tower and the room was cozy and warm, complete with couches and shelves filled with books. The smoke and flames are so real you might want to create a romantic mood or a reading mood for relaxation.

The Lava Lamps have an especially exotic soundtrack that can be played for a long time and can create a nice relaxing mood for massage or reading, while the microwave and Laundromat seem more industrial and not as interesting to watch. Those are part of the Novelty Collection.

Enter the ""Party Views"" and you turn your computer into Boogie Lights, Spin Bright, Star Field, Disco Floor, Tie Dye or Count Down mood. The most amusing seems to be Boogie Lights although Spin Bright is stunning in its hyonotising power. Need a break from writing, stare into this portal for some interesting visual experiences. Tie Dye is like mystical smoke rising in lavender, sapphire, lemon, pastel orange and swirls of green turning to light blue and purple. The most magical experience on this DVD.  If you put on Star Field, you can move through space while typing in Word. It gives your writing a new perspective. The soundtrack seems to imply deep space.

Wait, where am I? Oh, I've landed at a beach complete with trees delicately fluttering in an ocean breeze. Clouds move across the sky, but not as ominously as in ""Jack's Night Out"" which includes a pumpkin sitting in front of a scene of rain, thunder, clouds and lightening bolting out in the most frightening of ways. In Spring Breeze, you can see fields of grass moving in a breeze and the sounds of nature are very prevelant.

Autumn Breeze is filled with nature sounds and leaves falling from the top of the screen. Winter Freeze is more realistic with snow falling outside a window. When typing in front of it, your words seem to be falling with the snow. Fun illusion. Snow Glow is similar, but themed for Christmas with sleigh bells and Christmas lights. The sleigh never appears and I almost though it would. Finally, there is a fireworks display.

With so many choices, you are sure to find a mini escape into the soundscape and landscape of your choice. Each screen plays on a continuous loop, so that might work for holidays or parties. You may also just want to give your cat a fun 5 minute break from her normal life and be completely entertained watching the interaction. As for me, I love the Lava Lamps. Meesa seems to agree. She will sit here with me and watch the lava lamps while I type.

2181792,4,B0006BHP9M,"My family loved this DVD.  My husband liked the fireplace (esspecially the pops and crackles).  My daughters had fun with most of the scenes.  I loved fishy-fish.  I will admit that some of the digitally created scenes (fireplace is real and goldfish is real) were disappointing/frustrating, but a fun variety here to be sure.

If you are prone to seizures, you probably don't need me to warn you that some of the scenes may be best avoided.  I took quick peeks to see what my daughters were viewing, and even those peeks left me feeling none too great.

Bottom line:  Fun fireplace, great fish, otherwise fun variety, but the digitally created stuff was not on par with fireplace and fish.  These other scenes brought my review down to 4 stars, but the DVD is complete enough with just the fish and fireplace.",1126483200,12,810,4.647887323943662
2181793,5,B0006BHP9M,I bought this DVD to turn my TV into a variety of fun scenes.  I was surprised how the fireplace scene was the best I've seen yet.  It is better than the DVDs I've purchased that were just fireplace scenes only.  This DVD has quality scenes and gives you some fun choices.  It is on the top of my list of best scene collections.,1125964800,14,328,4.078125
2181794,5,B0006BHP9M,"I highly recommend Fun View TV for holiday entertaining. I played it during my Halloween party last year and it was a huge hit. It's like having instant decorations.  The DVD has non-stop scenes for Halloween, Christmas, Valentines Day, New Years Eve and 4th of July. Very cool.",1125619200,3,278,4.791666666666667
2181795,5,B0006BHP9M,"I bought it for the Fireplace video.. to keep my ""imagination"" warm during the cold winter months.. But I love the other nineteen videos too! There are plenty of choices for holidays and events throughout the year. All great quality!",1102896000,8,233,4.85
2181796,5,B0006BHP9M,"The firepalce video is the best that I've seen yet, it has a great ""warmy quality"" with lots of natural sounds. But The DVD also has a lot of other very cool scenes that are nice to play at parties and holidays.. keeps the kids occupied during family events.. thank god..",1101081600,11,271,4.333333333333333
2181797,5,B0006BHP9M,"I bought this DVD a couple of weeks ago and I've gotten a lot of use out of it already.  My kids love the fish and snow scenes and the fireplace scene is so cool, you warm up just looking at it :-).  Bottom line, this DVD is really cool.  It's ranks toward the top of my ""Why didn't I think of that"" list.  I recommend this DVD for anyone.",1101081600,7,339,3.8
2181798,5,B0006BHP9M,Perfect solution for party decor! The fireplace was great to have on in the background. I got tons of compliments - Everyone loved it! There are so many scenes to choose from - It's really a great value! I highly recommend this DVD. Very Cool.,1098748800,3,243,4.4222222222222225
2181799,4,B0006BHP9M,"This is is the best DVD game we've played since the Scene It! series came out. The questions and categories cover a great range, making it terrific even for players of varying ages who may best remember things from different eras/genres.

The graphics are far better than any other DVD game of late, the hosting not overly cheesy, and unlike other games of its kind, keeps score for you! No rolling of dice or moving pawn pieces on a board needed--just pop in the DVD and play!

The only problem is that there isn't much of it. Each DVD contains only 3 games each! I can't figure why they would include so very little content, and there aren't that many volumes of each category (TV, music, movies, etc). It's a letdown for such a fun game.",1215388800,,740,4.4338235294117645
2181800,2,B0006BHP9M,"Some of the scenes, such as the beach scene, look like animations rather than real scenes.  Another reviewer said, ""child-like,"" and I agree.",1209168000,,141,5.130434782608695
2181801,2,B0006BHP9M,I was disappointed in this DVD.  Many of the scenes were childlike and the scenes were not as breathtaking as expected.  I was hoping for more of a DVD as displayed in Bed Bath & Beyond which I should have just paid the extra money for.  Sometimes you do get what you pay for.,1204761600,,276,4.074074074074074
2181802,4,B0006BHP9M,The Fun View TV DVD was Great!  This DVD has so much diversity that it can be used for practically any gathering.  I found myself oddly soothed and entertained even when I was alone.  While not all of the scenes are of a realistic quality they do provided a much better view than a blank screen.  The single erratic fish was very disappointing but for the money and (again) the variety I was pleased!,1194566400,,400,4.364864864864865
2181803,2,B0006BHP9M,"I was hoping for more from this DVD.  I guess I should have checked it out a little more before my purchase. I was going to give it as a Christmas gift. I don't like it well enough to do that.
Wasn't near the quality that I had hoped for.",1194393600,,238,3.76
2181804,5,B0006BHP9M,"I bought this dvd for myself and my mother.  My mom lives in Houston and they have no fireplace in their house so I thought she'd like this....and she does!  Now it's tradition in her house to have her ""fireplace"" on during the holiday months.  I love it too when company is over....they all get a kick out of it.  I'd recommend this as gift, it's great.",1194307200,,354,4.2388059701492535
2181805,3,B0006BHP9M,"""Fun View"" is a DVD containing numerous short videos. The most realistic is a closeup of a blazing fireplace. It is about 2 1/2 minutes long before it loops, and has pretty good video and sound quality. There is a video of a goldfish against a white background with goofy ""bloop bloop"" sound effects for the audio tracks. There are a couple of oddballs, such as the video of the running microwave oven. The rest are all partially or completely computer generated, and some (such as the zooming starfield) are literally computer screensavers caught on video. They're all well done, but do look a little fake, especially on a large HDTV.

In contrast, the VJWorld ""Fireplaces Fishtank & Lava"" (FF&L) containing 5 short videos, each about 30 minutes long. They are closeups of a two fireplaces (classic and modern), a campfire, a saltwater aquarium, and a lava lamp. The fire and fishtank videos are excellent, in sharp focus and with good, realistic sound quality. There are many active fish in the aquarium, plus some coral and a shrimp. While the DVD is standard def (480i), everything looks pretty good on an HDTV with a quality upconverter in the TV or DVD player.

The ""Fun View"" and ""FF&L"" fireplaces are similar, and perhaps a little better on ""FF&L"", and the ""FF&L"" fireplaces are much longer before they loop. The ""FF&L"" aquarium is much better than the ""Fun View"" goldfish. Both discs have a lava lamp. (I'd have preferred a freshwater aquarium.) ""FF&L"" is a clear winner over ""Fun View"" in the ""fireplaces and fish"" department.

However, ""Fun View"" does have seasonal videos, such as a jack-o-lantern with lightning in the background and a New Year's Eve-style countdown clock. They might be useful to play as a sort of animated decoration for a party. For variety at the expense of quality, ""Fun View"" is a reasonable choice.

Since neither is terribly expensive, a third option is to simply get both.",1192060800,17,1911,4.817073170731708
2181806,5,B0006BHP9M,"This DVD is awesome, it is perfect for when you want to make a piece of ""art"" out of your big TV screen, my infant baby loves it too. You will only be happy you bought this! CHECK IT OUT!",1191715200,,187,3.7
2181807,4,B0006BHP9M,"While I think this was designed for party backgrounds and such, I found it fun to plug it in when I got to surfing too much with nothing on that I wanted to watch. Putting this on with the fireplace background made me pick up that book and actually read it. I liked all the other scenes too, quite a variety!",1184976000,2,308,4.065573770491803
2181808,5,B0006BHP9M,"Item was very nice.  The different themes are great for the price.  I actually purchased the DVD for the fireplace scene.  I am glad that I  didn't buy a DVD of the fireplace scenes only, because I now have the option for holiday scenes and such.

Great buy.",1181606400,2,258,4.291666666666667
2181809,5,B0006BHP9M,"Twenty different screens to choose from for every mood and moment.  It's a nice to have at work late at night to help time pass.  There's Seasonal, Novelties and Party Views.  I found things in each that I like and for the money you really cannot go wrong with getting this dvd.  (Each selection loops btw)",1180483200,,306,4.410714285714286
2181810,5,B0006BHP9M,"This is exactly what I was looking for. No goofy stuff, just a crackling fire grate & logs, and a bonus..I like the lava screen/Asian inspired track! The crazy ""microwave pizza"" and ""drying laundry"" are also fun at times. Dvd came in a timely fashion and in very good condition.",1180224000,,278,4.58
2181811,5,B0006BHP9M,"The fireplace shot in this dvd is actually far superior to the Ambient Fire dvd! It is a real wood fire with nice dry wood so it snaps and pops now and again like a good fire will. And unlike the other one, this fire loops every five minutes so the fire never dies down. It has a nice even quality, not too bright and roaring at the start, not too low and dying at the end.

There is a snow scene in here that is also very nice. It does look like it was done on a computer, but even so the snow falling on the trees is pleasing to look at.",1178409600,2,539,3.769911504424779
2181812,5,B0006BHP9M,I got this disk for the fireplace.  Great sound effects and picture.  I'm enjoying it.,1171584000,,86,4.666666666666667
2181813,4,B0006BHP9M,"This disc is great to have on in the background at parties. We bought it for the log fire for our Christmas party, but the other sections are good too. When we played the ""fish tank"" section, it's the first time I have ever seen our cat take notice of the TV screen - she was transfixed!",1170892800,,287,4.052631578947368
2181814,5,B0006BHP9M,"This is a great DVD! I am planning on ording two more for birthday gifts. The fireplace setting was what I really wanted, but the others were fun to look at as well as relaxing. I am so glad I order this one.",1169856000,,208,3.86046511627907

2181816,5,B0006BHP9M,"I bought the DVD for the sole purpose of using the fireplace setting.  A bunch of my friends and family own RV's and we camp for Thanksgiving and New Years every year.  I gave this DVD to each of them as a New Year gift to use in their motorhomes and trailers.  Now we all have an indoor ""fireplace.""  It was a big hit!!!",1169078400,,321,3.96875
2181817,3,B0006BHP9M,I love the fireplace track but the rest are silly.,1168473600,,50,4.1

2181819,4,B0006BHP9M,"I purchased this hoping that it would comfort and relax my fussy 2-year old and help to put him to sleep. I pop this in the DVD Player and put it on the fireplace scene and he's asleep in ten minutes. Very relaxing to watch the flames and hear the crackling of the fire. The goldfish scene is alright...but there is just a plain white background (no plants or anything) and the bubble noises seem kind of fake, but it's still good. Some of the scenes do look a little computer-generated, but are pretty good regardless. The microwave scenes are probably our least favorite. All of the scenes do continuously play, but they are NOT completely seamless. For example, after about ten minutes the fire scene freezes up for about 3 seconds before the scene recycles. Great variety on this DVD...Fireplace, Goldfish, Beach/Tropical scene, Fall and Winter scenes, Lava, Laundry spinning in a clothes dryer (my 3-year old likes this one) plus a whole lot more!...We like this DVD and are glad we bought it! Only rates a 4 because it isn't a completely seamless play...",1168214400,,1060,4.704301075268817
2181820,5,B0006BHP9M,"I had previously bought other fireplace DVDs and was very disappointed. This one is the best by far.

I agree with another reviewer that the slight pause in the fireplace is noticeable, but it's not a big deal.

My cat also loves the fish.

The other scenes were great, too. They were computer generated, but fun, nonetheless. I love the laundry in the dryer. Sometimes I play it while doing housework for a good chuckle! The falling hearts with romantic music is cool. And I don't think the disco scenes are obnoxious... you just have to be in the right mood.

The only scene I really don't care for is the lava lamps because the music isn't relaxing to me.",1167523200,,658,4.458333333333333
2181821,5,B0006BHP9M,"I bought this DVD for the instant fireplace. It's awesome for that feature alone. The fire is realistic, it fills the whole TV screen, and it crackles like a real fireplace. I swear the room feels warmer when we have it on! And the other features are a good bonus. The beach is not my favorite, because the tree looks fakey, but the kids like it. The party scenes are good background stuff to put on when you have people over. There's a lava lamp, and flashing disco lights. I often put these things on without the sound and play our own music on our sound system. It's better than having TV with commercials on. We like the view of the clothes tumbling in the dryer for ""visual white noise"". If you have to get a toddler (or a daddy) to sleep, this one works a wonder!",1165017600,3,769,4.238095238095238
2181822,5,B0006BHP9M,"I was genuinely surprised how many great scenes you get with this DVD. The Video Fireplace is an instant classic - I highly recommend it for any Christmas party.

2181824,5,B0006BHP9M,I got this dvd because I was looking for a fireplace dvd just to put on in the evenings to relax to. Out of all the ones I looked at this one looked best so I ordered it. I got a fireplace and so much more. My kids love all of the scenes and they are just mesmerized by them. I just pick one and turn it on and they just sit and listen or watch. It is a way to have the tv on without having to watch most of the junk that is on tv nowdays.,1152748800,16,439,3.489795918367347

I'd bought 2 fireplace DVDs this one and another solely dedicated to a fireplace DVD and the one soley dedicated to be a fireplace DVD was pretty lame.  This one is good because the fireplace scene is good, nice crackling fire and + it has other features that are fun too like the lava lamps, fireworks, and other eye-candy fun stuff.  A great value for the price I paid.  I bought one for my sister and her kids to put on in the background instead of them all watching mindless TV instead.",1140652800,9,616,4.267241379310345

2181828,3,B0006BHP9M,"I bought this ambiance DVD over others because it had so many different scenes to pick from.  Mainly I just wanted the fireplace though.  Once I got it, the fireplace was nice (no music or anything to distract from the natural burning sounds).  Very realistic.  My cat loves the goldfish scene; the snow scene (with or without the multi-colored lights) was also nice.  I can't really see myself watching any of the others though.  Only 2 (the fire & fish) were real-life.  The rest of the images were computer-generated, although of very good quality.  The party-type scenes (disco balls, etc.) are rather obnoxious, music and all.

Scenes included:

Fireplace, Goldfish, Pizza in a microwave, Clothes in a dryer, Disco balls, Psychodelic abstract images, snow-falling scene with & without colored twinkle lights, autumn leaves falling, etc.  There's something for every season.",1136678400,14,878,5.2
