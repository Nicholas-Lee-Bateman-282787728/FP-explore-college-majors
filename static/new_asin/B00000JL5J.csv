I used to watch it every single day and now that my love for this band has rekindled, I can see why. There's something very special about it, having been taped before they struck it huge until a year or so later. It's a very simple, basic performance, but highly enjoyable! A must for all Blondie fans!",1282521600,,415,4.333333333333333

7912550,5,B00000JL5J,"I saw a lot of concerts in my younger days - front row at Springsteen's 1st tour, Dire Straits' 1st U.S. tour, etc. - and many others - and now I wish I had seen this band.

YouTube did it for me; when I saw the energy and excellence of the great Deborah Harry I realized that my negative view of Blondie in 1978-1982 was my own stupid mistake.

Oh well, I am now a Blondie junkie and this DVD, which is a complete ""set"" of 11 of their early songs with all the transitions - IOW, they play straight thru - is the real deal. Yeah, I guess you could say that they went on to bigger and better things but if you like to study the craft of rock 'n roll you will not beat this IMO.

And fellas, I gotta tell you, your wife or girlfriend probably won't like this... It's the shirt I think ;^)

7912551,5,B00000JL5J,"A must for all Blondie fans (hardcore and casual). It's also a must for all red blooded, heterosexual men who like to look at beautiful women. Deborah Harry looks incredibly gorgeous in this early Blondie concert video recorded in a German TV station in 1978. Not only is this entertaining visually, but I actually enjoy listening more to the video version than I do to the original studio recorded cd's. Fine performances by Debbie and all her band members.",1196985600,,458,4.810126582278481
7912552,5,B00000JL5J,"Incredible quality 30'footage from a german TV show in 1977 !!! Sound is excellent and picture too,only complaint is those horizontal bars sweeping the screen more often than not but thats an origin flaw and you won't notice them one you're into this exciting performance. Non punk  reviewers might tell you this is Blondie at their punkiest,well that's debatable;to my punk ears this is power pop/new vave with some rock n roll elements but I love it !! Debbie wears an olive green tank top and no bra !!! And she shakes pretty much if thats what you w...kers are wondering !",1125532800,,576,4.647058823529412
7912553,5,B00000JL5J,The footage of Blondie on this video is great they were just starting out and were still more into the punk rock style. It's mostly their early songs that didn't become hits. The footage is raw and Debbie Harry is beautiful with lots of energy on stage. I wish it was a longer show but it's worth seeing if you want a look at the early Blondie. I also enjoyed the Blondie video collection on DVD that has alot of their early videos from the 70's!,1060560000,,446,4.1976744186046515
7912554,5,B00000JL5J,"I have seen this before and I can tell you it is rare and
fantastic.  Considering you can't buy The Best of Blondie
on VHS anywhere, this definitely will fill a void.",1014768000,,166,4.1875
7912555,5,B00000JL5J,"The footage on this video is in great condition. The audio and the video are crystal clear. This video is taken from the popular German television show ""Musik Laden"".  Blondie is in top form and it's easy to see that at the time this was recorded that they were just getting started on what would be a great career.  The best part of this video is that this is footage of Blondie in their earlier punk rock days. This is before they went pop, so it's a raw in your face style.  Overall I was very happy that I got this tape and would recommend it to anyone interested in seeing what Blondie was really like in the early days.",986428800,,625,4.191666666666666
7912556,5,B00000JL5J,Debbie and the band show what they've got even before they made it big.  True foreshadowing of this bands potential.  Great tunes from Blondie's first two albums.  Debbie's voice is strong and her performance is vintage  Blondie.,962064000,7,229,5.108108108108108
