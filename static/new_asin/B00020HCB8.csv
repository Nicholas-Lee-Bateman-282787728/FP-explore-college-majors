2052518,5,B00020HCB8,"I have been a fan of this cute...and wacky Halloween film for some time now!!!!!!! The movie teaches a lesson not to be afraid of witches, monsters skeletons, werewolves, and vanpires.
I saw the second one tonight and I want this movie Halloween....I  love Scary Godmother. Get this.",1128902400,,283,4.895833333333333
2052519,5,B00020HCB8,"Young Hannah Marie's best friends live in the spooky town of Fright Side, a place filled with vampires, werewolves, and other ghouls where it is perpetually Halloween. It's definitely a scary place, but luckily she has her Scary Godmother--an only slightly eerie guardian--to help her through! With this home video release, which is ideal for any time of year, eye-catching computer animation is used to bring to life the beloved series of children's books by Jill Thompson. Grown ups will love it as much as kids.",1123891200,,514,4.988372093023256
2052520,5,B00020HCB8,"I love the Scary Godmother characters ,stories,and theme,because they're creative. I own this DVD and many of the books,etc. for this reason,but not only for this reason. The ""animation"" isn't the general cartoon type from tv,and is more lifelike in many ways.

A young child going trick or treating for the very first time in the care of her naughty older cousin faces fear in the eye innocently  bringing Scary Godmother ,the Queen of Halloween,to her aid.

After meeting a monster who hides under beds,vampire children that go to school at night and more at  Scary Godmother's party,

Scary Godmother decides to teach the child's cousin a lesson which is no picnic for him or his friends.

Although I like the book  ""Scary Godmother"" better,this DVD adds characters from other Scary Godmother stories such as Harry,the lazy werewolf. I recommend it for all ages.",1117843200,,865,4.965277777777778
2052521,5,B00020HCB8,"And it's on my Wish List, I automatically would give this 5 stars, based on Jill's history with the Scary Godmother!

She's got such an excellent eye for ""just gross enough"" and the fact that Hannah Marie ends up befriending everyone (including Bug-A-Boo! (the big multi-eyed monster)) and ""gets into it"", is just *perfect*!

If you love Hallowe'en, and you like a good entertaining scary-gross combo, you'll *adore* the Scary Godmother! (Look for the books, too!)",1097884800,,464,5.092105263157895
2052522,4,B00020HCB8,"Since Halloween is my fovorite Holiday, I could not resist buying this DVD for me, and my kids.  I had not previously seen this made-for-TV special, but found it for such a reasonable price, I took the plunge.  In hindsight, a good move.  Here is a list of my thoughts as they spill from my gooey BRAIN!!...

-Why 4 stars?  The CGI is a little crude (when compared to other TV CGI productions).  I'm being a little picky, but I found it a distraction to see ocassional surfaces protrude through things unintentionally (Head through hare) and unatural motion for human characters (a bit ""floaty"").

-The story is near perfect.  It captures the Halloween spirit we all remember as kids.  All FUN with a hint of SCARE!!

-Some references will become dated with time (I'm a rich baseball player in an SUV"") but overall, it's not too trendy.

-I got a little tired of the ""Wolfman being hungry"" gag.  The vampire family, on the other hand, epitomize funny scares.

-This DVD is extras free.  A bit dissapointing but not a show stopper.

-Color is spectacular.  All the greens, oranges, blacks, reds and purples you wish Halloween shows would display.

-Dispite the nit-picking, I really fell in love with this as a holiday regular.  It will be a tradition in our house.

-Some of the dialogue was ill timed and poorly paced, but the voices were spot-on.  Truly appealing characters all around.

-Definitely a few lessons for kids to learn from this adventure.  ""Consequences"" certainly a key point.  Also ""judging a book by it's cover"", ""don't believe everything you're told"" and being responsible, are hammered home while enhancing the story.  No small accomplishment.

-The soundtrack is ""Shock-n-roll"" alla ""The Munsters Theme"".  Actually pretty cool!

In a nutshell, other than a few technical ""gliches"" and some timing flaws (at least I thought so),  you can't go wrong with this Halloween ""Spook-tacular"", especially if you have pre-teens, though I really enjoyed it myself.",1095897600,33,1975,4.920972644376899
2052523,5,B00020HCB8,"It's a great pleasure to be able to introduce audiences everywhere to my cast of creatures. Check out the holiday special which was adapted from the successful stage play, which in turn was based on my collective graphic novels and comics!

Follow the story of Hannah Marie on Halloween night.  Ditched in the abandoned house on Halloween Night while trying to fit in with the big kids, Hannah meets her Scary Godmother, the Ambassador to all that is Spooky.  Join her as she travels to the Fright Side and meets a cadre of Creatures That Go Bump in the Night-- like Harry the Werewolf, Skully Pettibone, the Skeleton in the Closet , the Vampire Family and Bug-A-Boo, the Monster Under the Bed, and conquers her fears.

Heartily endorsed by ages three to eighty three, the holiday special is good for the whole family.

Gothic moms and soccer moms alike give two thumbs up to The Scary Godmother Holiday Spooktakular.

Make it your pre-trick or treat tradition!

Creepy and Kooky, Shreiky and Spooky, not Gory or Gross, this Special emphasizes the value of not being afraid of what  you don't know and being true to yourself.

Animation fans will delight in the beautifully rendered cgi and comic fans will appreciate the true to source characterization!

Try it! You'll like it!",1094515200,15,1279,4.799086757990867
2052524,5,B00020HCB8,"I'm a huge fan of Jill Thompson and her wonderful 'Scary Godmother' series of books and comics, and I've owned the Canadian edition of this DVD since it became available earlier this year.  This special is essentially the first SG book with some plot elements from later stories thrown in.  It's very faithful to the spirit and style of the books, and I would consider it a new seasonal classic, great for kids of all ages at Halloween or any time!",1086134400,6,448,4.518518518518518
2052525,5,B00020HCB8,"Move over Charlie Brown, Halloween has a new classic that every kid and kid at heart must add to their Halloween celebrations.  Jill Thompson's wonderfully imaginative Scary Godmother story finally comes to DVD.  If you haven't read her books - you should - but for a quick intro definatly pick up the movie.  The movie introduces you the Hannah Marie, who is tricked by her mean cousin Jimmy into going into a haunted house on Halloween night.  There she meets her Scary Godmother and takes a trip to the Frightside.  Hannah meets some new ghouly friends and learns that you don't need to be scared on Halloween. The movie does credit to Jill's wonderful use of watercolors and her fabulous storytelling ability. After you've seen the movie you definately want to grab up Jill's books!!",1083542400,,787,4.8

2052543,5,B00020HCB8,I was about 7 years old when I first watched this movie on Cartoon Network. I fell in love with it by the time it was over. I watched it every single year that Cartoon Network aired it.

And with an awesome voice cast too (those of you that are Transformers Armada fans, Gary Chalk, voice of Armada Optimus Prime, is the voice of Bug-A-Boo and Harry in this movie), this movie is a must watch. Not scary at all and a good laugh whenever. Also, be sure to get the sequel, ""The Revenge Of Jimmy"" as well to complete the set!",1410307200,,630,4.214876033057851

I think that should show that it is good for children of all ages, she started watching it at age 5, and myself at 12, and we both saw it as such a good movie we have watched it every year since. It is probably one of the things I look forward to most when it comes to Halloween, I actually just bought the DVD last week... and I am 17. It is just an overall cute, hilarious movie that is just perfect for entertainment reasons and life lessons.",1376352000,2,773,4.092105263157895

2052639,4,B00020HCB8,"Scary Godmother was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid so I figured I'd buy it. Being older now, I see that the storyline is flawed and the backgrounds seem cheaply made. Other than that, I still love this movie and I enjoy watching it for Halloween. Very cute movie for kids.",1350518400,,284,4.277777777777778

2052641,5,B00020HCB8,"I'm 27, but still a kid at heart.  My favorite holiday is Halloween, and this movie IS Halloween.  The witty lines and clever addition of the universal moral (everyone's different but equal) make this movie a scream (pun intended).

I ordered them at the same time, but they shipped them separate.  I asked the company I bought from (-importcds) and they confirmed it shipped, but guessed the post office misplaced it.

I feel she is pretty intelligent, but all the reviews said they had kids about this age and the cartoon/story line is ridiculous. My daughter watched it for about 5 minutes and was bored out of her mind. If you're looking for a fun Halloween movie for your kids, this is not the one. No matter what age in my opinion.",1319932800,,435,4.069767441860465

2052644,1,B00020HCB8,"Sorry, we didn't care for this movie at all. I purchased it based on the positive reviews, which is usually a safe bet, but not this time. My kids are all in elementary school, and none of them liked it. The movie is colorful, but the animations are rigid and appear to be cheaply done. There are too many characters to keep track of, and they are creepy in a disturbing way, not in a fun or scary Halloweenish way. The storyline is all over the place and chaotic. It's a weird movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1319068800,5,519,4.252525252525253

Scary Godmother is a perfect Halloween movie for kids that helps teach them that it's okay to be a little scared sometimes, so long as you're having fun.

Britney Irvin was the little kid who played Hanna Marie and she is really cute. Highlights in this are Scot Macneil's skeleton in the closet and my very great favorite Gary Chalk's highly educated always starving werewolf. And Tabitha St. Germain who voices Scary Godmother, is one of the finest weird people in the world. If phsyics would allow it, I'd want her to be my godmother. The animation is great.

We bought both of them, because she wanted to watch them everyday and I accidentally deleted one from out DVR!!! Oh NO! She likes that the kids get over being scared of the ""monsters"" because they are fun and friendly monsters. Just like Monsters Inc. it helps kids realize that things aren't always as they seem! The CG images are terrific and the storyline is cute and nothing a mom should worry about. There aren't a lot of kid-friendly Halloween shows, but this one is okay for even the little ones.

I originally DVR or TiVo the movies. I ended up watching those movies over and over again until I had to erase them in December to make room for the christmas theme movies. The movie is a cute halloween movie that can be enjoyed as a family. There is a cute plot in which the movie can be used as a learning lesson for children. It was a relief to find a movie that is kid friendly and my children can watch.,1185235200,,558,3.9469026548672566

You have your typical bully with a witch, skeleton, monster, vampires, and a werewolf to help set the mood. That is where the normal idea of Halloween ends because then this delightful story twists any sort of typical Halloween ideal and sends it off in a whole new fun direction. Jimmy is the older cousin who doesn't feel like being saddled with is younger cousin Hannah on Halloween. With three friends he decides to send his younger cousin screaming home by sending her into the Spook House. Before the night is over Hannah learns that monsters aren't necessarily the ones who look like them. Jimmy will learn a lesson as well and all of this is picked up in the second movie.
