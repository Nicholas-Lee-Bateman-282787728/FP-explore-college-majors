6619376,4,B00NAQ3EOK,Interesting and creepy at the same time.,1416096000,7,40,4.857142857142857
6619377,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"Oh, where do I start?  First off, I'd really rather give this movie a 3.5, but I'll round up because it's got so many good actors in it.  I'm really not sure how this movie has flown under the radar?!  You have Ryan Reynolds, Rosario Dawson, AND Scott Speedman?!  That's 3 very well known actors, but I haven't heard anything about this movie?!  Either way, let's get into it, shall we?

My one MAJOR complaint (not sure if this is considered spoiling or not - be warned):  This movie jumped between 2 different time periods without so much as a hint that it was happening.  There was no character development before you were thrown into it, just BAM! and you're there.  I was very confused on what was going on or even who some of the characters where during the first 30 minutes.  Luckily, after I realized what was happening, things were very simple to follow.  I really wanted this movie to be a 5 star film, but there were parts in the movie that only seemed to be included as time filler.  Other than that, the acting is TOP NOTCH!  Production is very well done and the story itself was interesting enough that I never felt bored.

Final Verdict:  Definitely watch it, once!",1411689600,8,1180,4.4485981308411215
6619378,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"""The Captive"" is not your usual ""B"" film kidnapping/imprisonment film. The beginning is a bit confusing as it utilizes flashbacks which I didn't realize for the first 30 minutes, making this film a confusing mess to begin with. I will briefly sort out the first 28 minutes of the movie. If you don't want to know...stop reading.

Cassandra (Alexia Fast/Peyton Kennedy) goes missing from the back of her daddy's truck cab. Matt (Ryan Reynolds ) her dad becomes suspect number one to the Niagara group ""Anything For Love"" headed by Nicole (Rosario Dawson). Matt's wife Tina (Mireille Enos) blames him and turns against him. Jeffry (Scott Speedman) who is part of Nicole's group is openly hostile toward Matt.

Cass has special privileges as a captive and provides her captor with a unique service which makes this film a bit different. Matt tries to find Cassandra on his own (better than when OJ went looking for the ""real"" killer)  while the group works without Matt.

The film makes for a good ""B"" movie. It over utilizes the flash backs and really should have never had the flashback scene near the end which had me scratch my head...but wasn't she? How did? Oh a flashback. Of what? A day? A gimmick they really didn't need. Or was it a trick?

A four star film that was cut to three stars by the director and editor.

6619395,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"Odd to see so many one and two star reviews. I can only glean that those who have left poor reviews were hoping for something gory and sensationalistic. Rather than overdo what this type of crime and abuse is, the film portrays a particular little known fetish of some human trafickers.
The acting was great. Mireille Enos has a depth and honesty to her acting. Ryan Reynolds showed more of his gravitas than I've seen. Well cast, creeps and all.
The timeline is a bit tough to follow at first, and forces you to pay attention.
All in all, a very good film.",1507852800,,557,4.41747572815534

That something could happen. That something could happen to them. I made sure we have bad dogs. Mean guard dogs and I was vigilant. In being careful. In fact I even closed an establishments. It was a music store adjacent to my home. Just so strangers. Would not know I had children. This film makes me want to snuff the life. Out of child molesters & pedophiles.

6619406,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Unless you simply want to see Reynolds play more of a character than himself, this will likely disappoint you. Reynolds and the cast do fine, but the plot just isn't compelling nor does anyone really get to shine.

First off, I feel the need to warn my fellow (Ryan Reynolds; The Change-Up, Mississippi Grind, Deadpool, The Voices) fans out there.  This is not a Ryan Reynolds movie.  It's more of an ensemble cast featuring Rosario Dawson (Rent, Alexander), Scott Speedman (Underworld, Duets), and Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, Smokin' Aces, Mystery Alaska).

This film definitely took Reynolds out of his comfort zone (i.e., he didn't play himself or anything even close to it).  He plays a father tortured by distrust and guilt.  After leaving his young daughter alone in the car at a pie shop, he returns to find she has vanished.  Reynolds does a more than convincing job falling apart as he is bombarded by accusations from investigators who think he was involved, blame from his wife, and the grief and disconnection any parent would experience under such dire circumstances.

The story then fast-forwards 8 years, when the investigators have come across images of whom they believe to be his kidnapped daughter...alive, and deeply embedded in an online pedophile organization.  Yeah, they went there.

The guilt and blame get pretty heavy, but I never found myself impressed with the story.  Reynolds character ends up in an uninspired chase scene finale and then things get resolved a little too quickly and conveniently for my taste.  I enjoyed this movie but, honestly, I think it's just because I enjoy watching any Reynolds movie.  It was also interesting seeing Kevin Durand play something other than a big, strong, tough guy.  I guess this film allowed both of them to shine their acting range a bit.",1496620800,2,1827,4.986798679867987

This portrayal of a chilling reality, leaves the viewer feeling more than a bit uneasy, and unsettled by its final scene.  Kevin Durand exudes a quiet, meticulous depravity, so well played, that it will be hard not to see him as ""that guy"", for some time; kind of like Mark Harmon trying to escape his role, as Ted Bundy.  Were it not for unanswered questions, loose ends, and ""figure it out for yourself"", shifts in the timeline, this film might have gotten another half star, from this viewer.",1485993600,,709,5.094827586206897

6619637,2,B00NAQ3EOK,The movie was only mildly entertaining.  The plot was good but the timeline was difficult to follow with past and present intermingling in a way that was confusing.  Too much was left up to the audience to put together and the plot suffered because of it.  I would not recomend this movie for those reasons.,1485388800,,307,4.545454545454546
6619638,5,B00NAQ3EOK,Ryan Reynolds is a great actor. He really made me feel how he felt. I love thrillers and this is a great one.,1485388800,,109,3.782608695652174

6619649,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"It was okay but tried too hard to be different in my opinion with the timeline shifts - I didn't count how many times the story jumped from the present to the past but it was a lot and was distracting to the story.  The acting was pretty good but just kind of dull.  I had no sympathy for the perpetrator and it seemed they tried to humanize him, which didn't work for me at all.  Plus, the script was hard to believe in quite a few parts.  Spoilers:  To name a few unbelievable parts: the ineptness of the law enforcement over years and the computer skills of the pedophile ring, the victim being allowed to see her dad and the fact she was captive in one place so many years by one person and the relationship between the victims and the kidnappers.",1485302400,,751,4.223776223776224

6619807,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"""The Captive"" starring Ryan Reynolds as Mathew, father of abducted daughter Cass, portrayed by Alexia Fast, had a slow beginning for the first third of the movie. The setting was gorgeous in the Canadian backdrop of a snowy landscape and a somewhat lush Niagra police department. The natural greenery against the pure white snow gave a hopeful feel to this pallette; then the pallette turned to slushy, dirty snow which allowed the viewer to feel the dirtiness surrounding the pedophile ring Detective Nicole, portrayed by Rosario Dawson, and Detective Jeffrey, portrayed by Scott Speedman, ultimately brought down.

** SPOILER ALERT ** The actors did a very good job in their respective roles, although this viewer felt the plot had some gaping holes in it. No explanation is ever given as to why Mika, portrayed by Kevin Durand, watched Cass's mother or wants to hear sad stories from people; Durand gave a superbly creepy performance, however. Young Cass had been stolen and held captive for eight years, police searching for her - and the entire thing is resolved in the last ten to fifteen minutes of the film with no explanation as to how the police suddenly were able to find kidnapped Detective Nicole with no confession or help from shot and dying Mika. No real answer as to why Cass's hints to her dad about their last conversation, word choice of ""gimmick"" over ""trick"", helped him solve the case. The final third of this film had plenty of action, yet felt too rushed as it moved to a happy ending without viewers seeing what happens. Perhaps these jumps were left on the editing room floor.

This wasn't the greatest film in the world, but it was an interesting and entertaining way to spend almost two hours so this viewer is comfortable giving the movie a single thumbs up.",1484697600,,1788,4.8019480519480515

I might not have bothered, reading some of the reviews, and yes, I sometimes get a little annoyed with movies which jump all over the place in terms of time; However, that did NOT spoil this movie for me because I thought the acting was superb and it is a psychological thriller, so you have to keep that in mind.  I would watch it, again, down the line.  If you like your movies to go A, B, C, D, .....just the way you like everything to be, then it will not be your cup of tea.

Or when Reynolds tries to clock the a-hole detective - Why not keep pounding the point - what are you doing to find her?  Who is in charge of the search?  How many men are searching?  etc.  Stupid lines.  Canadian mush.

6620156,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"The concept had the potential for a good movie, however, there were so many discrepancies within the plot sequence and small moments that didn't quite make sense. It was hard to believe that certain prominent characters (the parents, the police) would truly act this way at seemingly pivotal moments within the movie--it derailed the whole premise and discredited most any real emotion or reaction they had, as well as the movie's potential. It was quite painful to watch.",1483660800,,472,5.064102564102564

Said another way, it is interesting but not for everyone.  All the performances hit the right note, with the exception of the villain who is a little too creepy as to be almost obvious.  The movie does a good job of illustrating the impact a missing child has on a marriage, the overall subject is better handled in ""Prisoners,"" a movie of higher quality than this one.",1483660800,,536,4.505154639175258

6620276,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"It was decent, but the ending felt extremely rushed and anticlimactic. I never felt like the characters earned their victory, but rather that it was given to them via super plot power. It also made NO sense why the cops didn't believe the dad the entire time, even though the guy went full vigilante and they knew about it.

There was a serious misuse of multiple timelines that could've been worked into a wonderful twist ending (there's no twist at all), but ended up being thrown out halfway in favor of linear storytelling. All the while baiting you into thinking there's the potential for a twist ending or some purpose behind the multiple timelines, which I expect out of good psychological thrillers.

Acting was strong in this. Everyone did a great job in that respect. The daughter had some weak points and was probably the worst acted (followed by the randomly introduced and awfully written hitwoman character), but played her role pretty well.

Overall, it was a hodge podge of decent ideas behind a pretty excellent premise (a child abduction ring not used for porn, but watching people's true anguish at the loss of their abducted child).

Everything and everyone moved slow and I found myself wanting this movie to speed up. I only finished to see what happened to the daughter and the ending was rushed leaving me to wonder why she was kidnapped and so much more.

Someone named Atom produces and directs a movie, hmmm... well, you can look that up. But the movie is a disjointed techo thriller with one actor that absolutely makes you believe he should be behind bars and all the rest spent too much time in ""bars""... Reynolds was okay. He was really the only rather sane person in the movie (his 'wife', schizoid neurotic dingbat and she doesn't engender the slightest sympathy).

6620596,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"So, you're just going to steal the trailer off the truck of the guy whose daughter you kidnapped 8 years earlier because he happened to show up to a job sight that was shutting down due to snow and he also happened to be towing a bunch of pine trees that you then use to lure him to a unnecessary reunion between the before mentioned kidnapped young woman and her father, all the while hoping that the cops won't wonder why you're stealing this guy's stuff or maybe say, wonder why you're leaving a bunch of pine trees down the middle of the road.  What would've have stopped the guy who got his trailer stolen to just call the cops, then he and the cops follow the trail of trees to the kidnapped girl and her kidnapper?  Movie over at that point I guess they needed another 20 mins or something shoved in the middle.  I'd like to see the original screen play to see the story, which could have been good, to see if the story was ruined by poor direction or production or whatever, because half of this movie made no sense at all and could've been so much better if someone had just asked a few common sense questions, like why the hell is this in the movie at all.  It was like they had a bunch of ideas that had nothing to do with the story, they just wanted to work them in, so they through them all together around a decent plot, but instead of making one cohesive story line, it's just a bunch of disjointed premises that make no sense at all to the overall story.

They should have really toned it down with that. This looks like a small super snowy town...are the police THAT busy that it took 8 years to find someone? It also didn't look like they were looking too hard to find Rosario.
The confusing back and forth needed a little bit more finesse.

6620800,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"I will admit I watched it twice. I'm the kind of person who avoids watching movie trailers altogether because I like to experience a film without any preconception. Over all, the film does keep you on the edge, thinking, ""What's going on? What's gonna happen next? Is this person guilty? Is that person part of the bad guys?"" It's kinda funny that some of those thrilling reflections in the movie-watching experience are IN FACT the result of poor writing and editing. I would also agree with the other reviews that the plot felt a bit slow, and then suddenly rushed in the end. Going between 3 different time periods does get confusing--some captions or black/white contrast would've been nice. In regards to Reynolds, it's probably the first time I've ever taken him seriously as an actor. I actually forgot it was him, which was nice for a change!",1481500800,,850,4.75

I was pleased to see a selection that differs from the others. Many of the other entertainment programs kinda have a little bit of the same things so Amazon has greatly satisfied me with titles such as this that I have never seen anywhere and greatly enjoyed!

It was  a fabulous movie with truth behind it. Just for the story alone it  deserves 5 stars. Anyone who gives this  a 1 star has problems and is not right in the head. Sure the movie has its flaws but name 1 movie that is perfect. Very rare too get a perfect movie these days. The plot was strange but think about it if you lost you're daughter at  a dinner  and you're husband was the last one too see her you obviously would have alot of  bad emotions towards him. Let me just say that alot of kidnapping happen when you're out in public, so I did like that  there was some truth when he lost his daughter at the dinner.

6621264,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"I really thought The Captive was a good film. It is definitely a disturbing issue, and this film made it more so due to the realistic acting and those involved seemed to fulfill their roles. I can see this play out as seen in this film in real life. The pedophile guy seemed so creepy and true, I hated him right away and wanted him in jail. I think if I see him in another film I won't be able to put my distaste for him aside as he captured the behavior of the  ""sickos"" I've seen in documentaries and on"" true story"" crime shows. And having the father as a suspect and destroying his life as he was grieving the loss of his missing daughter, is very believable sit is probable, as I have been reminded lately in the Jon Benet wolf hunt, that has brought out the haters who cannot see past their own demons and need someone to hate... That poor family... Many of the press and police do not care who they hurt. And God forbid, they dare be wrong and retract their awful statements, and proven wrong opinions and so called ""evidence."" This is not a happy film and it can be too upsetting to us sensitive film watchers who take in really terrific acting like it's really happening. It seems very true and very real.",1476748800,4,1215,4.259740259740259

For a person who writes at times on a blog about missing children and historical events related to it, this kind of movies help me better understand what is under the skin of someone capable of doing what the character does in this movie. It also had the psychological side of the victim. Something that many movies don't portray, they only portray the fear, the anguish, but not the fact that this child can seriously be mentally ill in the aftermath of something similar to what happens in the movie. Even the pace while speaking has changed. It is admirable the work by its director, the actors, and I would say the whole cast. This movie has another pace as well, so if you are expecting just an action movie only, you will be deceived because it has its own way of developing, reminding me some great movies by the Cohen Brothers or some North European style. I like this movie very much. It gives something more than just being a movie. I would love to develop more but I don't want to write spoilers.",1476230400,4,1035,4.4526315789473685

This movie was not produced for audience interest continuity, as all that keeps us awake after 15 or 20 minutes is an occasional blaring of music that needs to be tamed.  Dont be fooled:  The story is still limping along, the whispering will begin again very soon, and you can go back to sleep.  Near the end, if sleep is broken before the credits, we see that the story finally developed somewhat, but it will use too much electricity to rewind to determine if it even matters.  The Captive is just not captivating.

6621460,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"The plot was kind of weird. I was disappointed with the lack of abuse (I don't mean full sexual violence but general abuse or torture) that movies like this usually portray from a kidnapper to the kidnapped) but was also pleasantly surprised that there weren't images or videos of child abuse shown even though a child trafficking ring was mentioned. Probably since that's a sensitive topic for most people.

It also seemed like the captor was mentally underdeveloped in his understanding of children and of sex, which happens all the time when it comes to pedophiles in real life; but it would have been nice to see something in his house in a separate room, or something where he fantasized about children and had a lay out of children and where's found them. Or anything to show that he had a child trafficking ring going on.

Another thing was with the cameras, how the hell did he get them everywhere? I was wondering throughout the entire movie how the captor was able to see and watch all that was going on. This leaves the watcher a bit confused as to what's really going on sometimes. Yes, he was following the family for a while to kidnap Cass, but how did he start following them? How did he find a way to get into the places that allowed him to put cameras where he wanted to watch her mom, the detectives, and other people/places?

I'm into psychological  thrillers so for me the suspense of some parts of the film I enjoyed, as well as the chase to find Cass and bring her home permanently. The ending left a bit to be desired but it was quite nice, having Cass end up in a place she revered as a home. outside of her home and fading out to the credits.",1475366400,,1667,4.402597402597403

6621483,3,B00NAQ3EOK,We were a bit thrown off with this movie because the way they decided to put it together where the story does not follow a chronological timeline.  It jumps between the past and present without indication - eventually you figure out that the next scene does not in fact follow what you just saw.  Just felt like it made the story a bit more confusing - and didn't add anything by jumping around in time.,1475020800,,403,4.36

The storyline itself was good and I haven't seen any movies like this before.  I never expected s movie would show how the kidnapper wanted to do anything he could do for his kidnaps to make her happy.  I think I would have shown how difficult it was for the child at first  and then proceeded with her age progression .  I didn't see the importance of the ice skating promise in the story . I did fast forward a little a couple of times because it seemed to be loosing my attention in spots .  I thought that the movie might end with her skating with her old partner? I was hoping for that although it was very touching that her partner never did skate with anyone else and he did keep his promise .  I would recommend this movie to my friends and family even though it is a bit hard to follow .  I think I would actually rate this movie beteeen 2 1/2 and 3 stars  because of the points I have stated above .
I hope that my review is of value and may answer questions anyone may have on vowing this movie .",1474243200,,1152,3.9695652173913043

This was definitely a movie you had to sit and watch and not be doing handwork or other surfing the web. It moves around in time, time spanning eight years.

Ryan Reynolds does not come across as a grieving father who lost his daughter very well. and the mother (who you might remember her from the short lived series the Killing, which I loved) also does not come across as a grieving mother very well either.
The movie does not delve into the underbelly of child kidnappings and exploitation and does not offer a satisfying ending. And the main detective , played by Rosario Dawson, had to be the worst police officer in the world and she allowed her self to get kidnapped.",1473379200,,574,4.58252427184466

6622075,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Not the best movie, but it kept me entertained. It's about a girl who's abducted while her father goes into a store to buy some pie, while she naps in their truck. He comes out to find that she is gone. Enos, the mother, comes across as such a cold hearted b#tch who focuses all her hate and blame on her husband, Ryan Reynolds, who is obviously shattered that his daughter is gone. The police aren't really helping and only fuel Enos's hatred. All the while their daughter is being help captive in a locked-up room, where she helps her lure more children over the internet by befriending them. Her abductor has the classic look of a pedophile, cheesy sweaters,that awful mustache is too funny. Mot the best acting, or the most believable, but was better than staring at the wall, lol. Don't go out of your wat to watch this movie, but hey if you need to burn some time, then why not..That's MY thoughts,",1472774400,,904,4.451807228915663

6622092,3,B00NAQ3EOK,I love Ryan Reynolds. I'm a huge fan. But this movie needs some help. There is no explanation of the back story. It leaves you wondering what exactly is going on. It makes reference to things that have no relevance. You sit there wondering when they will explain the story and they never do. His acting was great hence the 3 stars.

It took me that long to figure out the movies was doing the ""flashback in time"" routine but even so I still had no idea what the heck was going on. I'm certain that some kid was abducted by someone but that's all I was able to detect and honestly I really didn't care. This movie stinks, that's the best way to describe it. Nothing annoys me more than ""flash backs"" in this case all they manged to do was make a bad movie even worse. I wasted my time trying to understand this awful movie and judging the comments from other reviewers I am no alone.

I also thought it unrealistic that the mother would not say anything to anyone about finding the tooth and the trophy in the rooms she cleaned as a housekeeper. If that was me I would be talking to someone about what I found in the room, whether it was a co-worker or my spouse.

The acting is good, Ryan Reynolds and Rosario Dawson are on point as they usually are, however, every one else was disappointing. Truly, the downfall of this movie is the plot. There is no real resolution in the end, you don't understand the motive behind the kidnapping or why they were being followed... they could have developed the kidnapper a lot more than they did, especially since the movie isn't even 2 hours long... they definitely had room to make this better than it was.",1471737600,,700,4.4765625

There's a curious mixture of auteur chutzpah (Atom Egoyan wrote, directed, and, I believe produced the film) and confusion over where to take the story. The incompetence at every level is too annoying to make this film remotely compelling or entertaining. Despite the intentions of Egoyan's script, no one in it is sympathetic, menacing, or attractive. I can't recall a more uncharismatic ensemble put in a film. They're all given such ridiculous things to say and do that each actor humiliates him or herself on screen.

This isn't super obvious at first as the characters basically look identical, and don't age, so it's not a point clearly made, so things are a little confusing or hard to follow. Once you know what's happening and which time period you're in, it's not so bad. It's suspenseful,  but can drag on at points as well.

This is a movie about someone's child being kidnapped however they didn't show the kidnapping into well after the weird exchanges between the police and the parents were showed. You need that connection between what happened between the parents the loss of their child to set the tone for where the characters are coming from and so you can get on board with it. Then the ""ring"" that was supposedly exposed - a ""ring"" of what? I can assume what it was but if you are going to open up a story about something as horrible as the kidnapping and exploitation of children in our country then don't bring us there and then skirt around the issues.

The movie trailer is the only thing worthy of watching and I am grateful that I did or I would have been even more confused about the story timeline. The movie plot jumps aimlessly around without context and never fully explains relationships between the characters or the motives for their actions. The only reason I didn't stop watching is that I was curious to see if it could somehow pull everything together in the end. Do not waste your time. The ending is just as bad as the rest of the movie. I am sorry that Ryan Reynolds was involved with the making of this movie.

Usually NOT a fan of movies with a story line about children being kidnapped, abused, or anything negative happening to children.

6623017,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"I'm really not sure about all the other reviews. Yes it is a boring movie, the one cop is weird, and it goes on way too long - but I thought all the actors were good (Ryan Reynolds being my favorite as always), and I could understand the story. They went back and forth from different points in time, but they set it all up for you in the beginning. There is the time when the daughter gets kidnapped, 6 years after that and 8 years after that (which is now). The movie jumps between those 3 years.

SPOILERS:
As far as those that said they couldn't understand the movie: Father leaves daughter in car, daughter gets kidnapped and put into a weird trafficking scam for eight years. Meanwhile the detective in charge starts to get too close to solving the trafficking source (kidnappers), so they kidnap her. The daughter comes up with a plan to get the kidnappers caught by setting them up. The dad figures out who the kidnappers are and gets the police involved, then the police find the kidnappers and the daughter, which then leads them to the detective. In the end the bad guys die and the kidnapped detective and daughter are rescued.",1469145600,,1139,4.475961538461538

The fast pace and circular time/event changes made it a great roller-coaster. I believe that it is hard enough for a writer to make changes in time and place but to have it come across so well in film is even more amazing.  The producers and editors did a phenomenal job making cuts and transitions under director/screenwriter Egoyan. I'm not a big Mireille Enos fan and every time I have seen her acting it is basically the same character. Her character should have been played by someone who could have developed it more.  I think she needed to be strong and wounded, not just weepy and lost. Ryan Reynolds and Alexia Fast did good jobs at mixing things up and creating characters unique to The Captive. Not to spoil anything but there is a chase scene that was realistic. Meaning, the character Matthew did everything that I always say that I would do in a real-world situation. Again, good directing and production can do wonders,",1468800000,,1070,4.656084656084656

6623343,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"Big Ryan Reynolds fan since long ago. I must say this was just short of a train wreak you just had to keep watching. The flash backs and flash forwards got to be a bit much, especially since there were no warnings about them. One scene would be present day the next woukd be 8 years earlier then the next would be present day again. Ryan plays a distraught honest caring Dad but at times seems unstable. Rosario Dawson is another great Actress who does good in the role but there are so many scene changes it was just too much to follow. Hollywood seemed to rush this script out and it seems they were writing it as they were filming it. Such opportunity to make a great film and to utilize Ontario,  Canada's beautiful scenery , yet stuck to a few cold snowy roads, couple diners and one or two Construction developments in the area. I give 2 Stars simply for Ryan and Rosario. Best part about the whole thing was being a Prime member and saw it for free. Id have been upset dropping 14.99 on it or heaven forbid had to drop 20 on tickets plus concessions. I think Ryan owed someone a huge favor for this 2014 flop.",1468281600,,1116,4.264150943396227

6623375,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"I honestly love these types of movies! Ryan Reynolds and Mireille Enos were heartbreaking to watch and drew me into the story. The other actors were good but their performances suffered because of the way the story was told. Bouncing back and forth with the time really disjointed their performances and confused me more than it helped the story along. Especially since the actors all looked the same during the present and eight years in the past. Some noticeable changes would have been beneficial to the overall plotting of the story. Anyway, it kept me guessing, when I thought it would go one direction it veered in another way. I feel like there were several moments, scenes, that were missing that extra emotional impact that connects us to the film. Empty scenes that could've been pushed further to make this a really great movie. It had a better outcome than it could have had or that I expected it to and the ending was tied up too quickly. Overall it just fell short. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the unique story and the acting from Ryan and Mireille.

Plus the mental state of the daughter (completely normal in spite of being an abused captive since childhood) throughout the whole movie was unrealistic.

Although they were good actors, Reynolds far overshadowed them, thus bringing the movie line down into a mishmash.

6623466,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"This movie came right out of the gate with a suspenseful story and kept me engaged ALMOST throughout. That much it did well. The flashbacks were a bit muddy, as there's no real indication of when the story changes time lines, so you're left guessing at some points until a little ways into the scene. They could have done a much better job expanding on the antagonist. I still have no idea who he was in connection with the main characters or their society in general. So you're left accepting him as just another affluent psychopath. The ending was EXTREMELY forced. The writers abused the concept of deus ex machina to a point I've rarely seen before. You're heavily invested in these characters and pointed toward what promises to be a pivotal twist in the story arc and suddenly the movie is over and (without giving too much away hopefully) you're met with the cookie-cutter ending you'd expect. If the movie had been another hour long they could have done a much better job, but in the end they spent too much time on a lot of useless scenes. While most of the filming was very well done, I feel a lot of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor and replaced with scenes explaining more of the subtleties that present throughout. Also, the plot spans 8 or 10 years, but it's always winter. It's as if nothing happened to this family the other three seasons of each year. There's even a scene where the daughter asks her captor ""is it Spring yet?"" Appropriate question. But no. It's apparently never spring. After watching it, I had that feeling you get when you watch a movie based on a book and you know there was a lot of suggested material that would only be understood by those that read the book. But this movie can't even rest on that excuse, as it was written strictly for the screen. Worth a watch for some great acting from Reynolds, but don't expect to be wowed.",1467504000,,1896,4.482658959537572

6623486,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"I feel bad knowing that many people put serious effort and time out of their lives into making art and it is amazing that a film even gets made considering what has to happen to get a finished product. But hey, I go to work every day, and I work hard, too. So here goes.
A ridiculous script.
A crime and policing procedural with no actual procedure or policing presented or explored.
Deeply incompetent detectives in a specialized high profile unit.
A kidnapping and pedophile ring with significant resources, alive and well for years, abducting and killing, but in a city of about 80,000.
Secrets as an angle when never would that occur under such circumstances.
One of the worst film scores Ive heard in decades of movie watching. Irritating, indicating, and blundering. Tonal dissonance, suspensions, and other musical techniques used to generate an emotional reaction in the viewer through exposure to sound, specifically anxiety and tension, but only results in irritation and anger. A score that is ugly, neither evocative nor suspenseful, and often is laughable given what is taking place on the screen. Music can never replace an empty script with actors talking but not really saying anything. Probably only about 40 lines that had any real content.
An abductor and ring that gets loads of screen time without any backstory, but are caricatures of high school play creepiness.
The crime and pathology is bad enough and deserve serious attention when explored in art. The film is unwatchable. The cast deserves compassion and understanding, particularly Reynolds, Speedman, and Dawson. Im sure, particularly Reynolds, who is trying to move into delivering on some serious acting potential and develop a serious film career, and Speedman, who is already there as a serious film actor, but still looking for material (and choosing wrong in this case), thought that they were going to make a major, cutting edge criminal psychology film with a challenging, unnerving theme and showing the effects of loss, grief, guilt, helplessness, hope, and justice in the aftermath of an unthinkable, terrible event. What they got was a, literally, line by line weak script and an overall mess. The final straw is the decision to chop up the time line. Rarely a good choice and with no content to the script to support the choice  it actually works against the project. Time to move on, with lessons learned.",1467504000,,2400,5.015037593984962

6623490,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"This should have been a great movie. Ryan Reynolds gives an excellent performance as the father of a missing child. Mereille Enos does a fine job portraying his wife, the mother of the child. Rosario Dawson is always really good and she delivers a solid performance here as a detective trying to figure out where the child went. The overall plot is pretty good and the individual scenes are nicely done. But the movie's awful.

It's awful because it jumps back and forth through time, with no hints to the audience about the timeframe it's currently showing. Is this scene eight years ago? Two weeks ago? Who knows? I don't know whether the screenwriters did it from the start, or the director (also one of the screenwriters) did it in post-production, but somebody broke this movie. It's as if someone wrote the scene designators on cards, shuffled the deck, and presented the scenes to the audience in that random order. The result is a movie in which current scenes make no sense, given the scenes that led up to them.

I enjoy complex stories. I don't even mind time-jumping as it can help build tension and reveal past details on an as-needed basis. But this... this is not that. This is really stupid. This movie is full of 'Huh?' moments for no other reason than that the decision was made to present it in a bizarre, nonlinear fashion with no way for the audience to keep track. It's a runaway rollercoaster with no safety restraints, throwing viewers out of the story at every turn and (maybe) picking them back up at the next loop. After almost two hours of disorientation, the viewer's just glad when it's over.

And that's a shame. Because it really is a compelling story. And the actors and crew worked very hard to get it right.",1467417600,6,1742,4.612903225806452

6623500,1,B00NAQ3EOK,This movie is brutal!!! The plot could have produced a good movie but the director screwed that all up. It starts out with Ryan Reynolds' daughter getting kidnapped and the first thing the cops do is ask him if he sold her because his landscaping business is failing. Yeah because that would be my first thought. I'm sure that happens all the time. The acting was good but that is the nicest thing I can say about this. It has flashbacks that you don't know are flashback until half way through them and they don't help the plot move along. They never really tell you anything about the abduction or the ring of criminals that are responsible for it. The movie has so many holes and useless scenes it will make your head spin. My wife has made me watch terrible movies on LMN that look like Classic Academy Award Winners compared to this pile of crap. At least the actors got paid for this but I guarantee you they wish it wasn't on their resumes.

6623502,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"This is a good, solid movie. As someone else said, it doesn't get into all the details of what happened to the girl. We all can guess what those things are. It also didn't have a curse word every other sentence -- something that Hollywood should take note of. Not all of us speak that way. And, yes, this go for people from the lower socioeconomic rung. Even some of them know how to speak. I think that is perhaps the difference between reviewers. Some people have to have a really gritty screen play in order to feel that it has relevance. I actually related more to the husband and wife and their lives before and after the kidnapping. How does one move on when he or she does not know if  his or her loved one is still alive or not? I liked that the end was positive. Not every quality movie needs to end leaving the audience feeling hopeless and tormented. And, I'm giving it a 5 instead of a four because of all the reviewers who gave one and two stars.  Really?  Out of all the movies that these reviewers have seen, this movie is a one or two stars?

6623572,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"Egoyan is a bit of an acquired taste, I know, and this particular work took a serious drubbing by the critics.  But, this is somehow both a more accessible and a more horrific take on one of his most common themes, the loss of a child.  Despite This time, the emphasis is on the parents of a young girl who's been abducted by a pedophile ring.  But instead of the pedophiles being the gritty working-class monsters we've come to expect from so many films and news stories, these monsters are upper-middle class sophisticates with money and technology at their fingertips, and it's the parents of the stolen child who are the working-class zhlubs whose lives are at once shattered and yet fully-realized by their child's abduction.  The title refers to both their daughter and to them:  she is held captive by her abductors, while the abductors keep tabs on the unaware parents and their grief, turning them into another trophy from their crime.  Most of the story is set during winter, with the pristine expanses of white serving as a snowy metaphor for lives frozen by grief.  And who else but Atom Egoyan would have a macho actor like Kevin Durand sing the Queen of the Night aria from ""The Magic Flute"" in an earnest falsetto?  I give him a star for that alone.  Yes, certain story beats and dialogue beg our indulgence, but I found them worth it.",1466985600,5,1350,4.615062761506276

6623616,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Even Reynolds, who - in my opinion - is a great actor, couldn't save it. Telling stories out of sequence has been done well, and it's been done badly. This is an example of it being done (very) badly. As far as I can remember (and I watched this yesterday), the only thing that changed significantly was one character's hair length.

Sadly, the police attitude and pure incompetence was the most realistic part of this dreck. Basically (without spoiling anything, I hope), a financially-strapped man (played by Reynolds) stops to get a pie on the way home from his daughter's skating practice, something they do every week. She stays in the truck (lying down, because skating practice (which the police NEVER understand)) and when he gets back, she's gone. Because she was lying down, no one saw her, so he can't prove she was there. For eight years, the police never waver in their suspicion's of his guilt, so they never try to find the girl, except as part of their ongoing fight against online predators. Apparently, he reminds one of the detectives of someone in his own past, but - unless I blacked out - they never explain anything about it, even though this resemblance is the main reason the the cops never bother to investigate the kidnapping of a 9-year-old.

This may be a spoiler. But dang if I know. Meanwhile, the girl has been held captive (get it?) by a soft-spoken opera lover. He's tired of her now, of course, as an adult female, but he keeps her because she has other skills that he values (one of which IS a spoiler). It appears that she has convinced him to keep tabs on her parents and let her see videos in exchange for her telling him stories. Or is he having fun torturing the mother and getting a different kind of jolly by making the girl watch and tell him stories about them? Either way, she records these stories for him, and her Scheherazade gig is keeping her (and her parents?) alive. He forces her to re-record one story with ""less self-pity.""

I appreciate that they don't show any kids in creepy situations with adults, but they barely get the story across through exposition: the soft-spoken man is part of a ring of pervs. He's moneyed and might be in charge of security for the group. The girl, Cass, after years of abuse (they don't say if it is at his hands only), and eight years away from her family, doesn't appear to be damaged at all. She's convinced her soft-spoken captor to let her see her father and talk to him, and gives him a message that he eventually figures out that leads him to someone connected with the ring.

And still, meanwhile, the idiot cops are plundering around, still thinking the protagonist sold his daughter to pay off debts. Every time he encounters them, they insinuate that he's the key to the whole case: if he'd just come clean... The time sequencing is messed up here more than anywhere. It's been 8 years, but at one point, the wife - who visits with one of the cops every year - says it's been six. So is there an extra time period in there? Several characters are thrown in, who only succeed to show us how terrible the cops are at their jobs. It was like they took an episode of L&O:SVU and just mixed up the sequencing.

The movie centers around the disappearance of a mans daughter (Bryan Reynolds) from his car.  If I had not first watched the trailer, I would never have known what was happening as the movie started.  Also, the film bounces back and forth between what is currently happening and what has already taken place (flashback).

Don't get me wrong, it may just be me, but check her out in the tv show ""The Killing"", which for me was also rather spoiled by her large role. The bad guy is strangely acted as well, very ""affectated"", if that is even a word. And I like Scott Speedman, usually, but his character in this film was a waste of screen time. I wanted him to either be a badder ""bad cop"" or a better ""good cop"", instead of somewhere lost in between.

6624465,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"***MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this if you want a clean experience. The acting was 1st rate but it was hard in the beginning to follow the storyline to understand what was going on so it was a perfect way to set me up for the rest of the movie because I started to become frustrated and angry about 20 to 30 minutes in. I even said to my husband ""I'm not curious about this anymore, I'm just angry that I don't understand what's going on"" and he agreed, but we kept watching ...
When we finally put it all together about 40 minutes in we were appalled by the handling of the subject matter and the twist that just made it that much more sickening. It is about child pornography and a pedophilia ring. Please don't watch this if you have a tender heart. You will be gut wrenchingly disturbed & just might have nightmares. These types of movies should have warnings posted regarding the subject matter. My husband and I watch R rated movies that are massively bloody and violent - but THIS movie took a revolting subject matter and skewered you with the deadness & fury of those trying to stop it as if you should see it as scraping dogs*** off your shoe. Just another day of walking through a life of utter depravity that you are numb to.",1463875200,4,1243,4.339055793991417

6624649,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"Thought it was very good, Reynolds and Enos do a great job portraying two parents who had their daughter abducted. Enos being watched by the kidnapper just proves how many sick individuals there are in this crazy world. I've see documentaries how child advocacy groups go inside these chat rooms and track certain user nicknames to try and link these predators to one another. Of course, the police check out the parents first, just like in murder cases. It usually is a family member who molests their kids, their nieces and nephews.
I believe this movie showed just how dark and disturbing police work can be in these cases, the things, us normal people, wouldn't think what these pedophile groups will do. Grooming girls they've had for years to help catch younger girls.
No, the writing may not have been Oscar material, but it showed us the things these perverted groups are capable of doing. I'm sure they do things we normal people couldn't fathom being done to developing young children, physically as well as emotionally.
No one who's ever lost a child, the way Reynold's and Enos' characters have, could begin to know how the real parents who lost their children in the same way have gone through.",1463011200,,1207,4.779904306220096

6624663,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"Very underwhelmed by this film. Though it has a great cast, they battle with a script that is flat, flat cinematography, flat characters and dialogue, and over-complicated plot devices sprinkled with scenes and characters that are flat out unnecessary.

Ryan Reynolds is supposedly our main character, yet there are heaps of time we spend with our supporting roles that do nothing to further the plot. Rosario Dawson, who is usually amazing, is given a role that is built up to be important, only to deliver nothing in the end.

(Spoiler) it would have made more sense to have her character escape the van and end up helping save Cassie and Ryan Reynolds, rather than have her be magically discovered by the same police department who can't do anything right except be able to visualize puzzles that aren't put together (again, a scene that was contrived and had absolutely no point since that character did nothing later in the film).

The writer should have learned more about detectives and police protocols, and tried less to force down everyone's throats the idea that everyone believes Ryan Reynolds is the kidnapper, even though the motive forced on us is weak, and is stupid to think 8 years later he would still have her captive. But again, the detectives are so stupid in this film that that is the only suspect and motive they can ever think about.

But, if you like a good eye roller that continually makes you say out loud, ""what is going on? When is it now? What the f---?""--this is your film. You'll be left wondering why the edit jumps around in time, especially since there is no solid indicator of what period you're in. It's a game! Present day? 13 years ago? 8 years ago? 6 years ago? Does it matter? Nope.

If you want to see a good abduction thriller, don't watch this film, and go watch Room or Prisoners. Save yourself from the headache this film is.",1463011200,8,1874,4.649546827794562

I'll watch anything with Rosario Dawson and this is definitely in the realm of her better films. The same can said for the majority of cast. Scott Speedman is particularly good as a fairly unlikable but sympathetic detective.
It's a Canadian film packed with a mostly Canadian cast (Dawson and Merielle Enos being the exceptions) that includes the always good Bruce Greenwood, Alexia Fast, Ryan Reynolds and the underrated Kevin Durand.

The fragmented scenes in the preview are filled in by two-hours of story that turns out to be uninteresting, jumbled between past and present, and driven by characters who are stale.  The criminal cooperative of pedophiles did not seem realistic.  The victim and mother just came off as weird drawing little or no sympathy.  Most of all, the film failed to explain what was going on and the conclusion was wrapped up in about two-minutes.",1462752000,,570,4.775510204081633

A horrific premise to be sure, but sympathy for the daughter is hard to develop since she seems fairly well adjusted to the situation and her acting doesn't grab you.  The bad guy looks like what everyone thinks a pedophile looks like so there's no surprise.  I kept waiting to have the daughter's hints connected to how her father figured it out, but that never materialized.  No explanation for the woman who kidnaps the detective and no apologies from the cop who accused RR all along.  A film with much promised, one that is shot beautifully, but doesn't deliver on the plot.",1462752000,,757,4.562962962962963

6624977,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"This movie could have been decent, but the story line was really hard to follow. The story jumps back and forth between two time periods 8 years apart and it is really hard to keep track of every scene to know which time period is taking place. There are virtually no visual cues to help you. It was mentally taxing to keep track of where they were in the story.",1461542400,,362,4.185714285714286

Not your typical hostage, kidnapped daughter type rescue movie with a lot of bang bang shoot 'em ups where the hero manages to defy 3 dimensional reality and emerge unscathed.  Rather it's a mind jarring psycho thriller where subtlety defines the direction while the viewer gets drawn in over their head.  A truly excellent thriller.",1461283200,,504,4.825581395348837

6625005,2,B00NAQ3EOK,It was OK. They could of put a little more thought in the ending. Feels like it left a lot of unanswered questions. Ryan Reynolds did a good job. He gets 5 stars.,1461283200,,162,3.9393939393939394

The movie hits the levels, although the non-linear plot breaks can be a little difficult to follow when they occur. Not sure about Speedman's character, seemed like a stereotypical walk on. Reynolds is good. There is always something to be said for the Canadian winter, it's desolate resonance, and some of Egoyan's work, especially involving themes of family and loss. Imagine if something so unsettling to your moral compass sat beside you, staring at the side of you face while you unknowingly contemplated your day in random thought staring obliviously straight ahead, while they focused exclusively on you.",1459209600,,692,5.132743362831858

6625428,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"A disturbing movie that proved to be very interesting despite a few puzzling moments. Ryan Reynolds is really pretty convincing in his role as the father of an abducted child, and the villain in this story is creepy enough to keep your attention.  Many of the actors have French-Canadian accents, which would probably work out just fine except, unfortunately, the actress who plays the distraught mother of the missing child mumbles unintelligibly much of the time.  The story suffers from poor/unclear transitions from the present to the past and back again numerous times, so trying to keep the story straight is a challenge until the last half-hour. That said, it is worth watching if you like suspense, a story with some weird twists, and can handle a film that involves a missing child.",1458086400,,791,4.93984962406015

You have no idea who anyone is or how you should feel about them at first so you just end up resenting the movie.

6625572,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"This movie sucked. The story was fragmented at best and the choice to jump throughout the timeline without footers leaves the viewer confused as to the order of the events. There are also a ton of variables that don't make sense, from cameras in multiple hotel rooms for more than 8 years, to teeth that were placed under pillows of a 10 year old (who lost all their baby teeth 2 years before), and to career detectives that get drugged by strangers at a social event. I think the writing was weak, and I feel bad for the actors. It was a strong cast with Reynolds and Dawson, but you just can't fix bad storytelling with famous actors. Better script, better writing = better movie, and if you can get an A-lister than that's a bonus. Overall, worst performance I have seen by Reynolds, and I am offended that an actress of Dawson's caliber took this role. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!",1457568000,2,881,4.444444444444445

The actions of the mother were bizzare.  the inaction and actions of the police were infuriating.  in the SNOW at the crime seen, no one thought to search for evidence.  The second captive was found miraculously...i guess  the audience is not allowed to know how the crime was commited or how the 2nd captive was found.  Especially since it appeared that no foot prints, tire tracks, finger prints, or dna were noted at the crime scene.  It actually looked as if there had been no investigation.  There were no details just alot of crazy emotional people. Except the victim who seemed to be unaffected by years of captivity and abuse.  What a waste of time.  Who was held captive?

6625928,4,B00NAQ3EOK,I passed over this movie numerous times before finally viewing it.  There was something about the plotline that left me wondering if it would be too dark or  depressing to watch. My appreciation for Ryan Reynolds kept bringing me back to it. I am so glad I did. This truly stellar performance by Reynolds is perfectly matched by the intense delivery of Mirelle Enos.  A tragic and heart wrenching portrayal manages to keep an undercurrent of love and hope deep below the blatant decimation of their marriage through mutual grief that causes Reynolds to suffer yet again at the emotional onslaught from his wife.  Kevin Durand gifts us with a stellar performance that could easily have been overplayed but the subtle nuances and quirks in his performance makes the surreal situation believable and the characters create a flow to the plot and script that carry you along to the very end.  I highly recommend this movie for the performances and the emotional journey.,1456531200,,965,4.895705521472393

6626032,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"I watched this movie, only because Ryan Reynolds was in it, and I love him, but I had no idea what it was about when I found it.

After watching the entire movie, I still wondered what it was about.

This movie was all over the place, back and forth from the present to eight years earlier, and it was very difficult to follow the story.
This movie lacked emotion a movie like this should make the viewer tear up, but the acting was very poor, and the general feeling of the movie was just dull and flat and dragged out.
This movie was full of holes and left me with a lot of questions.

At the beginning of the movie, it was unclear who the characters were and what was happening.
Throughout the movie, and even to the end, I was confused.

I didn't care about the characters.  Every character in the movie just looked bored.  The kidnapped girl (Cassandra) didn't look unhappy or afraid of the pedophile, and although she said that she missed her parents, I didn't feel that from her because her acting was so poor.  She seemed bored yet comfortable, singing and playing the organ and being on the computer.  I didn't even care if the pedophiles got away with everything, because it wasn't even clear exactly what their crimes were or who was in charge of the pedophile ringit was only clear that the ring was large and the police were clueless.

I could feel Matthew's pain regarding the loss of his child, but Tina just appeared angry and depressed.  The way that Tina (the mother) and the two detectives blamed and suspected Matthew (the father) was disgusting.  It appeared that Matthew was the only one who really cared about finding Cassandra, and he absolutely did not appear to be guilty of anything (such as being involved in his own child's kidnapping, or ""selling"" her, or her murder).  No one thought for a moment that Tina might be guilty of anything, when there was no reason to think of her as any less guilty than they thought of Matthew, but the two detectives harassed Matthew and gave way too much sympathy to Tina.  Tina and Matthew did not appear to have any family or friends to help them, or for the police to question.

The two detectives (Jeff and Nicole) didn't look like they were were working too hard, and they didn't appear to care about their work.  They both seemed disgusted with their jobs, more than driven to save children.  When they met, there were no sparks between them.  Jeff said that he liked women with brown hair and blue eyes, which Nicole did not have.  Nicole was Jeff's boss, and she looked unimpressed with him during his job interview, and she appeared to begin working with him just because there wasn't anyone else available.  Suddenly, eight years later, they are at home together as a couple.  They had no chemistry as a couple, and it looked like they ended up together out of convenience.  Maybe it was too cold in Niagara Falls to go out dating, so the two detectives just settled for each other.

At the beginning of the movie (the movie is so badly out of sequence order, that the beginning had scenes from the movie's end), Jeff questions a man (it is not clear who that man is, but we see him with the pedophile a few times) regarding Nicole's disappearance.  But we never see Jeff or Nicole interviewing anyone about Cassandra's disappearance.  We all know that when a child is kidnapped, the first few hours are critical in finding the child alive, but these detectives did not seem to do any frantic searching or questioning or investigating.

Nicole seemed to be more of a social-worker to Tina than a detective...I didn't understand the purpose of Nicole's meetings with Tina.  Those meetings didn't seem productive in any way, so I didn't understand why Matthew was encouraged to attend.  The Police Department appeared like it was located in a rundown small town rather than in Niagara Falls (even Matthew said that it didn't look like a police station).

The snowy scenery was beautiful, but after a few scenes, it got annoying seeing so much constant cold.  The movie made a big deal about the black skate and white skate, but that whole thing made no sense at all to meCassandra seemed to try to use the skate colors as a clue, both to Matthew and during her story-taping, but no one seemed to get the meaning of Cassandra's hints (and I sure didn't).

Matthew worked as a landscaper, and we only saw him piling pine trees into his truck.  Tina worked as a maid in a hotel.
Why was the pedophile videotaping Tina cleaning hotel rooms?  How did he manage to hide videocameras in all of the rooms that she cleaned?  How did he even know which rooms those were?  How did he manage to constantly get into the rooms to leave little objects like a hairbrush or pinwheels? He didn't seem to ""watch"" any of the people who rented the hotel rooms, but only Tina.  It would have been more believable for the pedophile to use his skills and energies and money to hide cameras in a daycare center or anywhere where he could watch children.  Then he could have ""stalked"" children and kidnapped them.

How was Cassandra kidnapped, in a quiet and open area in broad daylight, vanishing in just a few moments, without even the sound of a car or car tracks in the snow, and no one seeing or hearing anything, even a scream?  How did the pedophile move all of Matthew's pine trees out of Matthew's truck and then pile the trees neatly and evenly spaced down the road without anyone seeing anything?  What was the point of the pedophile allowing Cassandra to meet with Matthew for five minutes? And why now, after eight years?  ""To make her happy?""  How could it make her happy to see her father for five minutes, then watch him get shot unconscious, and then have him ripped away from her again?

A woman in a wig poured a powdered substance into a drink at a crowded dinner party, and no one saw her do it?  There were many glasses on the dinner table that looked so much alike, so how did that woman know that Nicole would drink from that glass, and that no one else would drink from it, or that Nicole might even order a new fresh drink instead?  The dinner was to honor Nicole, but no one at the dinner cared about how Nicole was getting home - - didn't she have a limo waiting just for her?  It would have made sense for Jeff to show up at the dinner party late, or even go there at the end to pick her up, so what if they had an argument, they were in a relationship for eight years, and he should have gone to the dinner party.  What was the point of having Nicole kidnapped?  What was the pedophile planning on doing with Nicole?  Why not kidnap Jeff also?  Why not just kidnap another child instead?  The pedophile ring appeared to be so powerful that Nicole and Jeff were nowhere close to even suspecting their identities. (Nicole sat at the table with the pedophile during the dinner, socializing with him as if she respected him and looked up to him, but it was not explained who she believed him to be.)

A man named Willy is arrested, and the pedophile visits him in prison, but their conversation does not make sense, and we never see Willy again to find out what happened to him.  What was the purpose of the short scene where Matthew picked up a hitchhiker?

It wasn't clear what the pedophile did with Cassandra.  I could guess that he kept her locked in a room for eight years, raping her.  It was implied that she was forced to make kiddie porn movies.  Then it was loosely explained that she was used to lure children through the Internet to be kidnapped.  But the two detectives didn't seem to be working on finding endless kidnapped children.  Cassandra had access to the Internet alone in that room, but she never tried to contact anyone to get rescued.  Reviewers will probably say that it is the Stockholm Syndrome (like the true story of Jaycee Lee Duggard).  But Cassandra didn't even care about reaching out through the Internet to save the children that she was helping to kidnap, and she didn't care that she was key in causing other children to go through what happened to her.  It didn't make sense that Cassandra was the only one whom the pedophile held ""captive.""  It would have made sense if there were other children trapped down there with Cassandra or if Cassandra was moved somewhere else.  In other words, when Cassandra became ""too old"" to interest the pedophile, it would have made sense that he would have put another girl in her place and moved Cassandra somewhere else.  The scene at the end, where Cassandra was reunited with her parents, was just not as emotional as it should have been.

I am sure that there are more questions and plot holes that I missed.
I just know that I was confused throughout, and I barely knew what I just watched.
The ending was a mess.
I definitely could not write a clear summary to explain the plot of this movie.

There are a lot of ""five star"" reviews of this movie, but those reviewers don't say much more than: ""Great movie.""
If you loved a movie, and you took the time to say so, then you should at least write a few sentences explaining why you loved it and why you thought that it was ""great.""  This just makes me believe that all of those good reviews were planted and not real.  It makes me wonder if these reviewers watched the same movie that I watched.",1456531200,11,9298,4.471843509187908

The transitions were terrible, the time jumping was pointless, the bland cinematography, the stereotypical creep, the script could have been focusing on missing poultry for the amount of ""passion"" in it, and what the hell is the point of having so many characters when you can't manage to flush just one out completely.

The plot was actually good when they rolled it together with intense moments and decent acting by Ryan Reynolds. The wife did an excellent job playing her role as a distressed moth er.

I think the title of the movie was meant to be ""Stories"" and then that plot line used.  I think this is a good example of what happens when you do an artistic endeavor as a committee.  Starts of great ideas became lots of lose ends.  The slips and slides of time are ok, you don't necessarily need to put up a neon sign, but they needed more clarity.  Can someone tell me if we lost the female policewoman?  She was supposed to be killed but ends up in a talking van?  How does all this voyeur video fit in with the bad guy's motivation and personality?  The daughter was one-dimensional; she was making up sad stories but wasn't affected?  Maybe it was me, but the ""gimmick"" was also a potential good idea that was lost.  The key idea of a gateway was great but lost.  Nice production value, loved the idea of a high-end capture, loved the use of snow.  Worth watching...but you will have to watch it more than once.",1455753600,,1020,4.255208333333333

6626312,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Certain aspects of the film were not tied together very well.  For example the blond living with the antagonist came out of nowhere and no information was given regarding her relationship with him.  There also was no character development of the man who held the captive and how he could wire three hotel bedrooms for surveilance without anyone's being aware of it.  He may be a tech genius, and maybe he rented the three rooms for that purpose, but it raised questions in my mind.  I also had a hard time accepting the detective who harassed the father....are detectives really that insensitive to a parent's anguish?",1455580800,,618,4.80188679245283

6626323,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"From an acting and cinematography view, the film was good.  I felt the actors did a good job, which is expected noting the names used in the film.  I felt the story was interesting, but it did not paint a gritty/real picture of children trafficking/kidnapping such as something like the film ""8mm""; regardless, I will buy into the story of individuals with perversion and power kidnapping children feeding off their emotional hopelessness as well as that of the parents.
  Unfortunately, there was a lot that I could not accept.  Why would someone meet their parents for a time?  For that sense  of hope?  There is too much risk.  No one would attempt such a thing.  Noting how the villains had no issue attempting to kill individuals later in the story, it would explain that they would not be bothered trying to do so earlier on to reduce the risk of their plans being discovered.  These components in the story caused eye rolls.
  Finally, while some found the movie ""Memento"" to be genius, it is only because telling a story out of order made sense noting the viewer was perceiving the story much as the confused lead character who had mental issues.  Telling a story such as this one in such a fashion is unneeded and actually detracts from the story; it aided the story in no possible way, and it certainly was not clever.  That falls on the producer and director to rethink their ideas.",1455580800,,1393,4.628571428571429

Scott Speedman who is a descent character actor took his role over the top of believable.

6626755,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"The story jumps back and forward over period of 7-9 years. Yet, the actors and environment  look the same (including truck, which is supposed to serve landscaping business, yet looks after 8 or 9 years exactly the same as a new one) so some times it's difficult to understand where you on the timeline. There are many undeveloped side stories, which some times attract too much attention. The acting is not convincing and the story is full of holes (belongings of missing child appear out of the blue and nobody considers calling to police, although mother meets the corresponding detective at least once a year).

Good enough if you don't have anything else to do, otherwise you'll be sorry for wasting your time.",1454371200,,727,4.808

Scenery was a whiteout - snow everywhere, so once you've seen the first scene there wasn't any novelty or surprises the scenery added, nor was it surprising law enforcement would try to pin the child's disappearance on the main protagonist, Ryan Reynolds whose acting I generally enjoy, but in this case he wasn't given much to work with beyond his protestation of innocence and the flatfoots need to be looking elsewhere.

6626796,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"The truly good thing about this movie is that it only somewhat portrays the super-sick world of pedophile predators, not a few of which are indeed wealthy people who get off on the total power kick. (Check out the Lawrence Franklin Scandal [covered up by the FBI in DC] and all the child sexual predators in Washington, DC). The acting was only average, and the only believable character was Cassandras father, Ryan Reynolds. Rosario Dawson has really good natural Hispanic beauty, but is an unremarkable actress. This movie also makes me think what a travesty it is that more public awareness is not given to this sociopathic world of child predators. The best thing that I would do to improve the script was for the cops to have shot the Mika, the pedophile, in his leg to adequately down him, and then pistol-whipped the creep to find out where his partner was. A much needed vengeance kick at that point. They could have scripted more to show how they were able to find Dawson in the van. The ending of the movie was rather lame after the decent suspense they manage to build at that point. The best thing that I take away from this movie is that I am going to insist that my church keep missing and exploited children in the weekly church bulletin prayer request list. I can imagine that what really goes on in the sicko world of child predators is not something that any director could honestly portray in a movie for the public, and I hope I never see anything that actually goes on in that evil world.",1454198400,,1509,4.510948905109489

Great actors, interesting plot idea, scenic filming location somehow comes together as an absolutely awful movie.  How does this happen?!  So many things left unanswered. Who was the mystery helper girl?  Was the owner of the development company in on this?  Who make up the rest of the ring?  Who lured the girl in in the first place?  Is the skating partner part of this?  Why didn't anyone check out who was staying in the hotel rooms?  What about the rich wife? How did they find the cop? Are the couple miraculously happily married again?  Why did we spend so much precious time on this? Our dog had the right idea-he slept through the whole thing.",1454112000,,727,4.558139534883721

6627161,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"The score and audio were atrocious. The voices were quiet while background noise or music was so loud that it made it hard to hear over. The movie itself was ok, but the editing made it really confusing to follow as you couldn't tell whether the story was in the past or present. There was absolutely no reason that the male cop was acting so weird and antagonistic with the dad. Good cop, bad cop doesn't play well when the person you are using it on is the father who came in to report the abduction of his child who, you believe, was probably taken by pedophiles. The whole movie was creepy in that it almost seemed like they were trying to show pedophiles in a good, sympathetic light (i.e. they just want to hear little girls' stories, they put kids in comfy, decorated rooms, or that they just want the girl to be happy because they ""idolize"" them). I watched it to the end, so I thought it merited 2 stars for that--though I thought about stopping several times because of the voices being much quieter than the rest of the sound.",1453507200,2,1037,4.3782383419689115

The non-linear progression of the story is does not lead to any sort of reveal, only confusion.

Time has apparently zero affect on the world our shallow, and undeveloped characters find themselves trapped in.

There is literally zero character arc; which is not all that surprising given the fact that entire key elements of the subject matter at hand are wholly glossed over.

The happenstance which takes place in order to tie characters together is so unbelievable it is truly mind boggling that anyone could be so stupid as to write such utter nonsense, let alone that this garbage was actually produced.

Ryan Renyolds is the only redeeming aspect of this movie, and spoiler alert ladies, he never takes his shirt off. In fact, I am not sure if he ever has a wardrobe change. Its as if he, and all of the other dimensionless characters wear the same outfits for 9 years, which is literally how long this movie felt to endure.",1452384000,,1155,4.72636815920398

Horrible, predictable, wannabe thriller, with zero sense of care for any of the characters (Ryan Reynolds is barely the small exception).  This move sucked.  The casting director followed the same, annoying recipe, dictated by those who feel there aren't enough leading roles filled by African American women (and I'm talking about a leading detective role).  Follow that up with the even more offensive, lazy, young, white doofus, to portray the back-up detective role.  I have nothing against any of the actors, it's the delivery of that recipe that is so very old.  These audience betrayals happen, while trying to tell a hideous kidnapping story by jumping back and forth between an 8-year timeline, often leaving you wondering where we are supposed to be.  One thing to keep in mind, if the writer/director wanted to fulfill MEANINGFUL and BELIEVABLE ROLES, one should do some research and make those more believable.  8 years pass by and we are supposed to believe that none of these detectives got a promotion, or moved around into other units or positions within the department?  It's weak, and offensive to the actors who took on those horribly casted roles.  Not a single one of them foiled the crime.  Spoiler alert, it's Ryan Reynolds.  Such a sad, cookie-cutter movie, that should have been left for a network tv show storyboard.  That's all this is.  A long, 2 hour tv soap opera, with crappy acting and a bad mix of characters.  Ryan Reynolds does a good job playing the father, but he's got zero supporting characters or a good enough backstory to allow any viewer to really care.",1452211200,,1664,4.830388692579505

I gave it 4 stars then I switched it to 3 then back to 4 but the ending  sealed it's fate and I had to give an otherwise good movie a 3.

Somewhat Off topic :
Another reviewer complained about how the police were acting in the beginning and unfortunately it was all too real. As a victim of a violent home invasion I was treated much like the character in the movie. The cops kept asking why you? why your house? This is never a random act. Yeah okay lets see I lived in a over privileged zip code , on a dead end street that had 10 houses on it 2 acres or more for each house and it was a rainy day. Had it not been raining that day I would have been at work and it would have only been a B&E, bad guys didn't expect me to be there so to me this screamed prime target with a prime opportunity all on its own but they didn't want to hear it.

Child abduction is a parent's nightmare.  When this happens to the parents who clearly doted on their daughter, the first hole was dug.  Cops didn't develop well in the story, wife did not develop well in the story, child story had potential but only partially developed.  Father was most developed character and got the worst deal from his wife and cops.  Enjoyed Ryan Reynolds for the most part of a grieving father and finally at end got some brains to get his daughter back but the ending just left me questioning ( a niggling way back in the mind there was something suspicious about him)

He kept his vehicle just like it was for the eight years she was missing.  Why did he clean out the things for 8 years he held sacred in his truck once his daughter was saved? Why was the remembered conversation she had with him brought into the plot 3 times?  It bore no relevance to the situation.  To be honest the movie left a question (s) suited to a part 2 or at least a few clues more revelation in the trail of credits, that has directors doing to see if you stay around till the last name rolls off the screen.

I feel the description to the movie is misleading. I expected more along the lines of Taken. Honestly, one of the worst executed movies I've seen since ... Since .... I can't even think of the last poor movie I watched. And my friend's neighbor was probably the most believable of all of the actors besides Ryan, which of course he is the A list actor in this movie and played his role well, however, when his counterparts are horrible at acting, it brings his performance down, way down. The plot of the movie was about a daughter who was kidnapped, however the explanation to the movie failed to say that the movie in and of itself was truly about some disgusting pornography ring and abuse of children and although the movie never really showed that
( thank God ) it is implied through out. The young girl actress (the kidnapped) was a darn good no name actress. Hope to see her in more movies and see how she blooms as an (hopeful) A list member. Nothing of the movie was truly believable and I couldn't connect with any of the actors. I was hoping to feel some raw emotion from this film and connect with one or more of the actors/actresses. This movie fails to give that. I will make sure to stay away from any future movies with the same Director.",1449792000,5,1418,4.436781609195402

I spent to much time trying to figure where I was in the story and then bad editing and over sight by the director was when the detective had obviously been kidnapped and put in a van, how could she go to a hotel room and discover the wife was being watch and the back in the van.

Such people are more susceptible to unwholesome influences and may be more inclined to act upon them to the detriment of some unfortunate soul.

And she could pick it right up again when she was released after being holed up in a bedroom, watching her distraught mom clean hotel rooms on a computer monitor, for those 8 years?  The mother mumbled.  Even with the volume turned up to 50 (normal = 20), we couldn't understand her. Most sad, it didn't seem to matter.",1447891200,,710,4.5078125

The film jumps back and forth from different time frames without notification making the beginning of the film quite confusing. Once you finally get your bearings in this film it happens, you realize that there is no climax. The film goes about a linear projection and leaves you disappointed and confused. Does it have a beginning, middle, and end? Yes. Can you understand the film as a whole? Yes. Is it worth watching? Not at all.",1447545600,,666,4.605042016806722
6627947,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"So last week I went searching for snowshoes I went all over and never found any.  I went to try and find a dress for this thing with a dinner I was going to go to.  I worked and oh yeah my dog totally ate my homework.  There was this one time I was hanging out with my friends, oh that's it.

Confused yet!?  Yeah me too after watching this movie!!!  Which is about all the movie does.  It has a never ending supply of flashbacks, You turn around and yup you guessed it another unnecessary flashback scene.  I could never figure out what in the heck was going on.  Then it gets you all the way to the end and you think you are finally going to have closure and figure out what the heck is going on.... WRONG!  That's it movie over.  This movie felt like chickens running around with there heads cut off.

The story line was all over the place.  You never did figure out how any scene really linked to another.  what was the point of the kidnapping, why did they want all her memories? Why were they videotaping the mother?  It was a mess and a complete disaster!!
 Acting was good considering what they had to work with.  I so badly wanted to like this movie because  I love the actor Ryan Reynolds but this movie was such a mess it was hard to like anything about it.  Just do yourself a favor and don't get caught up in it.  Don't Watch it I promise you won't have missed out on anything spectacular... in fact you won't have missed out on anything at all.  Just find another movie and move along!

 I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I can't believe I wasted an hour of my time even watching it.  Do yourself a  favor and just don't even start!",1447545600,2,1657,4.148264984227129

6627949,1,B00NAQ3EOK,The entire cast sucked. The plot sucked. This was a waste of time - I can never get these 2 hours of my life back.

6627951,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"This movie feels like it hasn't passed the editing part yet. For instance, (spoiler alert) after the detective got kidnapped they show a scene where she stands in the hotel room removing cameras, just like that! they didn't hint that it happened before the kidnap or anything. Also, they didn't provide any explanation for how they found the cameras. so weird.

Another thing. All of the characters except for the father (Ryan Reynolds) are so flat. You can't get interested in any of their characters and they are so boring and predictable.

6628041,3,B00NAQ3EOK,at the beginning of the movie it was real good with lots of suspense...but when you get to the end its seems like maybe they ran out of money to make the movie and had to hurry up and end it lol.  There is a riddle in the movie that is suppose to help catch the bad guys but evidently they forgot to let any one know what the riddle meant LOL!

6628079,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"Eight years after their 9-year-old daughter Cassandra went missing, her parents Matthew (Ryan Reynolds) and Tina (Mireille Enos) are to know, in a different way, that their daughter may be still alive. Told in a chronologically shuffled order (like some of Christopher Nolan films), Atom Egoyans thriller attempts to captivate the heart of viewers, but except the star Reynolds effective acting and beautifully shot landscapes, the film fails in doing so.

I think I see the directors intention of focusing the impact that the sudden and unaccountable absence of someone would give to us  and I have seen some of the directors films including The Sweet Hereafter  but even so, The Captive is not very convincing either as a thriller or a drama, with flat characters lacking reasonable motives.

You see, in The Captive, a police officer (played by Scott Speedman), who should be polite and calm in dealing with this kind of delicate case, is incredibly rude and stupid. Kevin Durands one-note character walks and talks like a villain from a Victorian novel, with monster written all over him. In short, people just don't act that way.

Egoyans previous effort Devil's Knot was criticized for not telling us anything new about the case it depicts. Maybe so, but it is still ten times better than watching the badly written potboiler that makes little sense",1446854400,,1355,5.004444444444444
6628080,2,B00NAQ3EOK,The way this movie started it seemed to yanked me the wrong way. Their seemed to be no point being made in the first 5 minutes.

Yeah, if watching a couple fight and a police force be completely and unrealistically incompetent is your thing, you'll love this movie.  It ends abruptly with little resolve.

6628772,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"If you're a parent don't watch. Okay so I didn't read the reviews or know anything about this other than seeing the cover come up time and again on my suggestion list. And while I will say the the story is interesting and Ryan Reynolds does great drama acting (he's not just action and comedy!) The story line hit a little too close to home. I have two little girls of my own and this movie will probably give me nightmares for a while, just like any child abduction does story now that I have kids. Aside from Mr. Reynolds acting, there is little else that I liked about this story and oh so many plot holes. I won't list them all here, but here are a couple of whoppers:
What small town police office has a team of +/-6 people working internet child porn only? Granted this takes place on in Canada so maybe it's a little different there okay.
Who delivers a trailer full of trees to be planted when there is a crap ton of snow on the ground and more falling? The ground is frozen stiff, it's Niagra not the North Pole. Spring still comes to that part of Canada, or at least it did on the American side.
If you're captured, and you regularly have long conversations with your capture, alone, and he leaves the door open, why don't you hit him over the head with something and try and run for it? No attempts to escape at all.
The worst part for me was that both parents keep getting reminders of their missing girl, obvious, blatant reminders, and neither one calls the cops? EVER? It takes pinwheels, of all things, to get the mom the get the cops involved again. Not a skating trophy ""like the one [their daughter] won"", not a tooth that could have been used for DNA, not even a tranquilizer dart shot into the Dad?!?!? Come on people.
Well okay, the actually worst part was the totally crow-barred way in which the Dad finally stumbles into finding the captures. Clearly an after thought, as many things in this movie seemed to be. Time and time again it seems like the writing team was sitting around the table and someone would spit-ball an idea and they would all be like, yeah I like that, lets see if we can work that in here somewhere. Take out the whole bit about the female cop, beginning to end, and the related useless arrest of that one guy, and take that probably 15-20 minutes and put it into developing the little girl's side of the story. Why does she do some of the things she does, why doesn't she do some other pretty obvious things (see above), when did the parents fall out, one minute their fine then all of a sudden they are divorced. I could just keep going on and on and on.

Long story short, twisted story, poorly written but it gets points for some good acting.",1443830400,,2693,4.322134387351778

6628775,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"SO MANY loose ends in this movie I can't even begin to explain them all. Some people show up for 2 minutes and you never hear about them or their role again. Spoiler alert: Cass acts like she can't go/leave with her dad when he finally finds her, but at the end when she is actually rescued she goes back to normal and everything seems fine?? Most people that have lived with a captive for that long probably wouldn't go back to every day life like that, especially since she made it seem like she couldn't leave her new life earlier in the film. I got finished watching and felt like I still had a million questions that they didn't bother to answer. This would've been better as a TV series or something that could string the audience along and then actually give answers at the end!

It got bad, really bad, not so bad it's good bad, just plan bad. Reynolds gives a decent if one dimensional performance, and Dawson is slightly better, but the plot makes no sense, and the subject matter makes sure there won't be a  moment of levity during it's grueling 2 hour run time.

Decent acting but the story and character development (or lack thereof) had more holes than Swiss cheese.

The ending felt ""rushed"" like they ran out of time or money to finish the film.

Scenes about events 8 years ago were interspersed with current day happenings.  It was an interesting way to tell the story but I prefer the beginning to the end.  And perhaps I am naive.  Is there really a group of wackos out their who pay to listen to a young girl tell stories about missing her life?  Ryan Reynolds was great in the pic.,1440892800,,468,4.261363636363637

Strong point - you wanted to see a Ryan Reynolds type of guy find his daughter,  an answer to his quest for his daughter.  A hard working, truck driving regular guy who has had something terrible happen to him (and his wife who blames him).  The sleaze and his girlfriend - there could actually be people out there like them.  A terrible thought.  As above.  It was OK",1440892800,,538,4.3979591836734695

The acting was believable and there were definitely some crazy moments that had u on the edge of your seat. There was just enough creepiness, but not overdone. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was because I feel like the ending could have brought things together more and given us some more definitive answers to our questions.

It was at a great pace to sink you into the character's pain and how he coped with it.  Perhaps because I have a little girl of my own.  I really liked the movie and will be even more watchful for my own daughter.

The pretty Canadian snow provided the only possible relief from the monumental tedium of this turkey, which jumped from one disjointed (often confusing) scene to another.

Perhaps the biggest letdown was the total lack of character probing of the twisted psyches belonging to the twisted child abductors; however, at the end of the film you fully realize that the entire twisted crew responsible for this twisted abortion would have failed miserably at this endeavor, as they failed so miserably at everything else.

The cop dude was very weird (but easy on the eyes so I forgave them that) and his story was never explained. If you are looking for a plot that unravels and fully reveals you'll be left wanting. Otherwise I give high marks for minimal violence and not showing abuse to children it was implied but never shown. As a parent (hopefully as any human being) those types of scenes are hard to stomach. So was it a bit weak? ..yes but entertaining and I really did not know the story before it unfolded.

Add to that the frequent flashbacks without warning and it takes a while to get the big picture.

The story circled around with the father, mother and the detectives on finding the girl with psychotic predator who takes pleasure on doing weird stuff and playing with emotions of the victims. This movie made me more aware to become more careful and vigilant as a parent and learned not to leave my daughter ever again alone in the car even if they are already 10 years old coz we'll never know who is watching our kids.

It is a sort of schizophrenic look at a mysterious disappearance with trips forward and backward in the storyline.  Very good subtext and suspense.  Watching the preview made this movie look predictable and similar to other movies in the drama/suspense genres..... but it is not.

As impressive as the script was Ryan Reynolds acting in this film.  I have seen a lot of movies where Mr. Reynolds has demonstrated a real talent in comedy, but who could have known that he is an excellent dramatic actor as well.

This is a great movie with some neat originality and twists.  Not really for children, due to the topic but it is really a thriller and is very original.",1439164800,,730,4.700787401574803

The acting is superb... you enjoy every character but.. but then... it's like the changed writers ad the characters become STUPID utterly IDIOTIC in their decisions all to meet a climactic ending that looses all climax and then things get resolved by a mere act of sheer convenience... they find (spoiler... could be a major spoiler except that it happens in a way its not even important anymore) the cop just... just because and no enthusiasm is given to it.. and the girl is like... ohh yeah I have been in captivity all this time but it is alright now... the reactions and suspicions are very shallow... lacking a reason or deepness to them...

I think that's called a non-continuous storyline or something, but it doesn't take you very long to figure that out and from there the tension builds.  The acting of the all non-cops feels realistic for what they are living through, but I thought the police were, I hope were, completely unrealistic. Even with no evidence at all to explain why they they treated the father as they did, even after so many years, it was horrific. And they sure didn't seem to be interested when a child disappears.  I know you need a certain amount of info to call an amber alert, but there was such a blase response for the crime...it just didn't fit. Other than that, a very good movie that kept me wondering what was going to happen next right up to the last few minutes.",1438992000,,831,4.490066225165563

6630246,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Captive is a film that would have been way more enjoyable to watch and maybe a little easier to follow if it was filmed all in the same timeframe.  Instead we're in the present, we go back to the past, we're back in the present, we're back in the past.  It is just really annoying and one of those where you go oh hang on is that girl supposed to be that child who was abducted?  We also know that another character gets abducted because we have an unnecessary scene near the start with her poster where our one of the most incompetent movie cops ever blames another character for her disappearance.  It would have been better if that was a surprise when it happened as would a lot of events.  The film also has a lot of whispering and mumbling, it's hard to know what characters are saying, especially at the start when it's important.  You also wonder what was the point of some scenes such as the jigsaw one? Where we are introduced to a superhero powers like child crime fighting team, but when the small town's you would imagine biggest case occurs, they aren't used, and instead it is left to the incompetent rookie who immediately blames the father because he reminds of someone who was mean to him in the past and the rookie's trainer.

There's also a lot of questions that are never answered in the film, primarily why was the girl now grown up being kept alive and not killed, when we know there's been plenty of people killed and buried by conversations from the ring members?  Also since he's no longer into the adult original abductee, and kidnapping is so easy, surely he'd have another child locked up somewhere in the house?  Also you can't help think wondering why doesn't the adult version daughter just over power the skinny wussy abductor, hit him with any thing in the room and run up the stairs and out the door to freedom.  Even the nine year old version probably could have overpowered this guy.

This isn't a bad plot over all, and the concept of a child abducted and still around as an adult when the abductors no longer desire it as a bedroom toy but still serves some other purpose for them is an interesting one, however this part of the plot really goes into no depth at all and isn't explored or revealed to the viewer to any satisfying extent. There's even another character in this situation but again we learn nothing about her. The end ten minutes or so are interesting and have a bit of action but it's a slow mumbled mess viewing experience getting there. The villains' schemes, such as the tree one and even the original kidnapping rely on Ryan Reynold's character not turning around, using the bathroom, not looking out a window when you would imagine something that would have made some noise is occurring and for no one else to drive by the whole time you're planting trees on the side of the road where there is no where to pull your vehicle and the trailer over without impeding traffic while doing so.

If the timeline had been a linear one rather than jumping back and forth the film would have been more enjoyable, easier to follow and would maybe have rated a little higher.",1438732800,,3121,4.475352112676056

After eight years,two detectives discover recent images of her daughter in the internet. This gave him hope that her daughter is still alive and sought her daughter relentlessly.

After watching Ryan Reynolds from a good film Woman In Gold,I just felt that he made this film for the necessity to earn money without really caring about the screenplay. It was trivial and unrealistic. Many characters who happens to be psychologically impaired especially those who abducted Cassandra are far from convincing to be taken seriously. If there were good things about it so as not to deserve the lowest rating,it was that the film was shot on beautiful locations and it was wonderfully photographed.",1438473600,,1040,4.842696629213483

Did any of these hotels, where the mom worked or where the benefit was held, have cameras or ANY form of surveillance or guest records? FACE PALM. Did no one think of taking license plate numbers? Didn't anyone at the benefit think it was odd that the guest of honor couldn't hold 1 glass of bubbles...and think not think that maybe she needed actual attention?  I could rage for a while longer.

6630368,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Ryan Reynolds has shown exponential growth as an actor of late, and his performance in ""The Captive"" is no exception. The travesty of this film is that it dangles over the precipice of being a good film. Good acting all around, with Scott Speedman as the weakest link as the pseudo-cowboy detective, who just wants to catch the bad guys with his own sort of street justice, and his perpetual look of befuddlement at every turn.

The film begins powerfully from a visual standpoint, and then takes a turn for the worse, in story and in syntax. The timeline of the film is a jumbled mess, and we never quite know during which period of time we are actually watching, until its too late to care. Just as soon as it starts to make sense, the it's confusing again, and that's not really the worst of its sins.

In a nutshell, the film is about an estranged husband Matthew (Ryan Reynolds) and wife (Mireille Enos), who have lost their daughter. One day after ice skating practice, daughter Cassandra goes missing from the back seat of dad's truck while he goes into a roadside diner buy a cherry pie. We soon discover that (years later) Cassandra is working for an underground ring of sicko deviants, who are using her to lure other young girls over the Internet into their fold. The big mistake here, was the length of time spent showing the kidnapper discuss strategy with his victim. These segments are over indulgent and quite honestly eerily pandering, which seem to portray the perpetrator in a sympathetic light - this does not do the film justice.

There are some very good moments, but unfortunately not enough of them to classify this as a good film. If you're in the mood to watch a psychological thriller about a child gone missing, watch the incomparable ""Prisoners"" instead, and leave this one out in the cold.",1438214400,,1819,4.642857142857143

6630952,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"While I do love Ryan Reynolds and think his performance was pretty solid, the movie plot and writing was rather meh. The movie starts of nonlinearly, which only serves to confuse rather than as a useful storytelling device. After we finally get onto the ""real"" timeline, there are then unexplained time skips between scenes where you are only able to know what time you're in because the characters keep saying ""6 years since she disappeared"" ""8 years since she disappeared"" etc. If you're going to make it that blatant, just put a scrawl at the bottom of the screen that says ""2 years later"". All of this basically makes me feel like the producers read about nonlinear storytelling, thought it was a cool idea and did it with no understanding of HOW to use the device correctly.

Aside from that making things a little confusing, the story itself is lackluster. There's no real mystery to it at all, as the only ""suspect"" the cops ever have is the father himself. Which on many levels is incredibly infuriating beyond the obvious of making the cops look completely incompetant. It's like: a girl is missing and you spend hours interrogating the dad? They don't even *think* he could be telling the truth? And the one ""bad"" cop guy is suspicious because he thinks no kid would ever lay down in the back of a car? Yeesh. They try to explain this ""bad"" cop guy's dislike of Reynolds by saying he ""knew a guy like him"" once that he was investigating, but again the writing falls short because we never find out what ""guy"" he's talking about or how that case went wrong. Just hollow character building.

And the worst part about the whole movie to me is the mother's hate towards Reynolds. She of course blames him for their daughter missing, despite the fact that it makes no sense. Maybe at first in the heat of the moment, but jeez really lady? And of course it doesn't help that the cops are basically pathetic and can't do their jobs, thus placing blame on the dad as well.

Anyway, the story is lackluster, there's no real mystery to solve since the kidnapper is revealed from the very start and the cops have NO OTHER suspects, ever. And even the kidnapper makes no sense. Obviously he took her because he was a pedophile, but then still keeps her because... she apparently agreed to help lure other kids in? But oh, don't worry, she's still a good person and is not psychologically messed up in any way.

Just, ugh. This movie was a total waste of time.",1437264000,2,2457,4.552036199095022

Although the theme is disturbing, the acting was first class and the film built up suspense until the brutal climax.

The back story fill-in technique works well enough. This story is as much about the psychological trauma that an event of this magnitude would create, so the complexity, confusion, distrust, blame, and irrational behavior that the parents and police go through is believable and appropriate in my opinion. I can't think of another movie quite like this one so I have to give it a star just for originality.

Glacial pacing - double check.

It's not all bad though. The acting was excellent and the sets and production values were fist rate. With a better director and storyline it could have been an outstanding film. If only Egoyan were as creative as Lars ""Von"" Trier. Alas.

6631224,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"We were looking for something to entertain us one night on Prime, and stumbled across ""The Captive"" - which neither of us had heard of before...  The number of 'stars' (recommendations) associated to this film made us a bit curious, and since we're both Ryan Reynolds fans we thought we'd take a look ...  And while the theme of the film centers around some fairly 'dark' concepts (child abduction and potential sexual abuse) we thought it was an excellent film.  And then we both commented about our curiosity that we HAD never heard of this film before (... but then, arguably we're probably not the most 'current' when it comes to some films, and since I believe this is a Canadian film which may not have had a particularly wide distribution, well... there's no doubt to us that's why we 'd never heard of it).  But we believe it is yet another display of Ryan Reynold's talent and acting capabilities.  Combine his art with that of Rosario Dawson, Kevin Durand, Bruce Greenwood - and for that matter the entire cast, and it is sure to make an impression on anyone.  A really entertaining film - and no doubt Kevin Durand makes for one very despicable villain, absolutely. ....

I was a little disappointed in the ending, which I won't share as it might spoil it for someone else. As any parent knows, something that happens with their child is agnonizing. I think this show illustrated well the additional burden on parents when one or both are suspects and really have nothing to do with it. I think sometimes the authorities speculate what happens and then don't look further. I also thought the mother could have handled it much better, but there is no explaining someone's reaction.

Even though the topic of the movie is really awful, the movie is produced in a way that minimizes exposure to the ugliest parts of sex trafficking and the elite paedophile networks they sort of refer to. It's thrilling, the action is good, and the acting is great. It all takes place in Niagara Canada/US and it's very creepy and is the epitome of a psychological thriller. We both really loved it.

And the editing was terrible.  Some of the scenes made absolutely no sense and some occurred with no explanation and towards the end the scenes were spliced together as if the director was in a rush.

And the mother needed to be taken to the woodshed for a good spanking.  I'd never treat my husband the way she did and he just sucked it up.  Eight years of blaming the father with no proof.

I just have to say though, if you were wondering about the high level cyber-crime detective work in the film and whether its anything like real life-- its not. Not even close. The only thing that struck me as realistic is when they're bringing in the new guy and questioning him about his ability to handle the kind of work they do-- that's not weird.

I do not know if it was the writing or directing or both that had this movie jumping all over the place, but after the first several times, it became annoying and distracting. Common sense was completely missing from many parts of the movie. The police were not called about important clues. The main villain visits an accomplice in prison and the police do not follow him, nor get a search warrant, nor tap his phone. It's all just too far fetched.

The plot does not hold together well; you're left wondering how one event leads to the next and the sequencing of going back and forth in time did not help.  There's not much for the captor to do except act aloof whenever he's with his captive; his father's role is not fleshed out; the police detectives are unsympathetic and continue to treat the father, Ryan Reynolds, with contempt when it's clear he's not at fault.  However, each of the main actors rose above the storyline and came across as real people, so I can't say it's not a watchable film.",1434499200,,613,4.554545454545455

6631771,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"This movie does a good job of addressing a serious topic that needs more attention.  Conveying the heart ache and turmoil that accompany the abduction of children is, I'm sure, a difficult thing to do.  Mireille Enos brilliantly portrays the multitude of conflicted emotions a mother must endure in this situation.  Ryan Reynolds commands your attention with his role as the devoted father now desperate to save his little girl.  Their relationship is entirely convincing and tugs at the viewer's heart in every scene.
Peyton Kennedy and Alexia Fast make the role of an abducted captive very intense and believable.
The movie's use of fast forward and flash back in time is both effective and makes watching the film exciting.
Bad guy Kevin Durand is creepy and convincing while Rosario Dawson exemplifies a dedicated and compassionate law enforcement professional who maintains focus and is compelling as the ""good guys"" team leader.
The basic plot of the abduction of a 10 year old girl who is held captive for an extended period while her mother and father keep hope alive and suffer unimaginable emotional pain is an awful reality for too many families.  This movie is about that subject which is the stuff of parent's nightmares.  The well directed cast delivers characters that make the story very real by keep the pace spot on.  There were good plot twists and surprises without detracting from the main story line.
As a parent it was difficult to watch but I recommend it to other parents because I found that it challenged me to be more vigilant.

Well directed, great performances and a story about a topic that is so important make this a thumbs up for me.",1434412800,,1667,4.845070422535211

6631820,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"I must first confess a bias toward this film because I like the work of its writer and director, Atom Etoyan. I am similarly, favorably disposed toward two of the movie's lead actors, Scott Speedman and Rosario Dawson, who are often consigned to secondary parts. In ""The Captive,"" they are given enough screen time and dialog that they finally have room to shine, to show their talent in inhabiting a role so believably, they have become their characters. The other roles are equally well cast. Ryan Reynolds, whom I'd written off as merely a pretty boy, in this lead role surprised me with the depth and nuance of his portrayal. Bruce Greenwood is, as usual, stellar, and whenever he appears onscreen, every second, he makes count! Bravo to Etoyan for deftly humanizing a terrible crime and making it much more than a forgettable statistic. You are rooting throughout the movie for Reynolds' dad to reunite with his daughter, Cassandra, or Cass for short, a 9-year-old figure-skater who vanished while her father was buying cherry rhubarb pie to bring home.",1434153600,,1058,4.916201117318436

6631861,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Like Ryan Reynolds & commend him for his acting in The Captive.  For me, Reynolds role was the only believable character.

That's the best I can offer re this film.  Admittedly, I'm not a fan of flash back & forth between the past & the current day movies, period.  The creator of The Captive couldn't seem to make up his mind; he seems to think we're all viewing from a blamed time machine.  The first 30-to-45 minutes were confusing.  You finally figure out what's going on, but that didn't help my opinion of the movie---it was annoying.

One other thing bothered me a lot.  It concerns the detective who decided to search for missing children even though he had an excellent record as a homicide detective.  The writer depicted the detective in such a negative light as though he had a vendetta against fathers.  If the reason(s) for his untoward suspicions were explained, it/they went over my head.

The three stars are for Reynolds acting; zero stars for everything else.  This was not a good purchase for me, and is now going into the delete bin.",1433894400,,1054,4.60752688172043

It's trying to be a harrowing thriller, and it has some great performances. But it seems to have been edited into incoherent oblivion. Some movies use non-linear time editing to add drama, suspense, or interest. This is not one of those movies. There are also critical plot/character points missing that might have given it a chance.

---------SPOILERS----------
We establish a pedophile ring that is advanced in ""a way that has not been seen"" that is very powerful and behave in new ways... but we end the movie after Ryan Reynolds gets his girl back after 8 years... by which point I stopped caring about that and was more worried about the ring that captured a cop and brainwashed a kidnap victim into fighting for them...",1433548800,,436,4.8133333333333335

6632030,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"Why do directors and others involved with a movie that has great potential, like this one, not wake up to reality? For example: 1) A Dodge Ram truck that looks exactly like it did 8 years before and is intimidated by a wimpy Land Rover? Huh? 2) A dozen trees in the back of your truck can lead someone down the road? Huh? In reality it would take hundreds to accomplish the feat as shown in the movie. Even if the rendezvous place was right next door there weren't enough trees to leave a trail.  3) Totally unbelievable cops that question the father a few hours after the kidnapping. Huh? You don't start making accusations against the victim until you've got plenty to suspect and certainly NOT when they first show up to report their daughter is missing. At least Ryan Reynolds got to punch the stupid cop out in his driveway.

Then there's the wife who is miscast and you dislike for dumping her husband or at least abandoning him. Cops that have to end up romantically entwined when it's not necessary and the unexplained time travel jumps in the story that are too cool for their own good.

At various points, it was impossible to discern who may or may not have had various motives, if any; again, this goes along with the concept of the psychological thriller, but for me, there was no logical, or even feasible, points throughout the picture to which I could anchor on and stay with the flow.

6632271,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"I just got through this weeks-long movie, finally! (Is it still 2015?) I came here to write a review...a protest, actually. But many have beat me to the punch, and with excellent observations, too!  Here's what I'll add.

I was disappointed that I never got to know any of the characters as well as I would have liked to. They just weren't developed as real human beings. I didn't even get to know Ryan Reynolds' character that much, but felt a sliver of connection to him because he's famous and he got a fair amount of screen time. Still, the script didn't show much of who he was, beyond being a dad who lost his kid. That's not enough.

Reynolds may not have been famous at the time this was made, but still, to list him as a supporting actor? Really? When he carried the movie?

The parents' marriage was horrible--painful to watch. The mom's behaviors repelled me. Maybe that's how moms of kidnapped daughters act sometimes. I guess it could well be so. But it doesn't make for good entertainment.

Then what about the promo, which claimed this was ""...a psychological thriller about a man whose only option is to plunge into a world of deceit."" So he ""plunged"" for eight solid years? Didn't see much of that sleuthing happening on screen.

As for being a psychological thriller, the only mind game was having one's intellect artlessly tweaked and yanked by incoherence, while also put on grueling hold waiting for the ""suspense"" to take over in the jumpy story line. For me it was more like psychological detention.",1432944000,,1522,4.639405204460966

6632399,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"Atom Egoyan makes beautifully understated films. This is perhaps his least understated. Unlike many of his other films, it actually resolves. Fine performances, and a story that can easily be followed, once you learn the groove and swing of Egoyan's editing style (which often jumps back and forth in time without warning). In the end, I was happy, but conflicted about my love for this man's films. This is the most commercially appealing film Egoyan has ever made, and I'm hoping he doesn't stay this path. If he chooses to do so, then his best films are most definitely behind him. I'm a cinemaphile, and I love directors whose films reflect a style they've been honing for years, decided, generations. I've always loved Egoyan. But if you're an Egoyan fan, like me, this one might leaving you wondering...

Like most of his films, this one deals with family, a parents love and devotion to their children, and family tragedy. But this is easily his most Hollywood-friendly attempt at expressing his themes, and I found it distilled, and almost ""entertaining"", in an almost forced kind of way. I don't watch Egoyan's movies to be entertained. I watch them for the place of contemplation and meditation they always bring me to. This is a good film, but when it was over, I didn't reflect on life, my life, the lives of others, or the very notion of being human, in the way ALL of Egoyan's previous films have made me reflect. In fact, by the end, I have to say, I'd forgotten I was watching Egoyan.

If you're a fan of this great filmmaker, see it so you can draw your own conclusions. it's most definitely worth seeing, and it's most definitely a very good movie. But be prepared to be left a bit perplexed at the end. Egoyan has always made untraditional, unusual films that are unlike other films. If you've seen his masterpiece, THE SWEET HEREAFTER, then you know what I'm talking about. This film is rather traditional by comparison. Almost ""Hollywood"".

And If you've never seen an Atom Egoyan film before, it's a MUST-SEE.",1432080000,,2031,4.715492957746479

6632410,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"Strong performances from the actors, especially Ryan Reynolds.  That's about the only good thing about the movie.

The way this movie superfluously used time jumping really demonstrates the insecurity of the movie makers.  It's almost like a french movie that uses a gimmick to disguise a horribly made movie and try to pass it off as ""art"".  This way they could tell the critics that they don't understand ""art"".  If they wanted to use a ""time jump"", they should've shot the first scene the way they did, then added the note ""xx years earlier"" then shot the rest of the movie in sequence.  That would've made sense.  But instead they go back and forth without telling us which just leaves the audience scratching their heads and confused the entire time.

Note to everybody who likes to make these type of ""B"" movies.  I know Pulp Fiction is a cool movie.  Stop trying to be like Quintin Tarantino.  Nobody cares that the beginning is the ending is the middle is the somewhere in between.  Or, if you make a crap movie, stop trying to cover it up with gimmicks then diguise it as art.

The acting is great, however, from all involved. I am a fan of Ryan Reynolds and love him in just about everything he does. The other actors were truly great and were right along with him at the same level.",1431561600,,581,4.481132075471698

6632725,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"If I could give this movie zero stars, I would.

This has to be about the worse film since Sandra Bullock went full retard and - well I can't really say what she did because that would be a spoiler - in Premonition.

Bottom line, there's just not much that makes sense with this movie.  The main character is a landscaper, in Canada, where all we see is snow.  The main character's wife works in a huge hotel, but only cleans the same three rooms.  The bad guy who has kidnapped the offspring of these two, is weak-kneed and basically doesn't really do much until the end, and even then it's kinda like a last gasp.  Add to that a script that jumps back in forth in time just for the heck of it, and wooden performances that are about as inspiring as paint drying, and you have a real mess on your hands.

If you want something to put on in the background, then maybe this flick will work.  But if you don't want to be asking yourself questions about the movie every two minutes (Why don't the police investigate? Why doesn't the kidnapped girl try to escape?  Why does the bad guy take every risk in the book, just asking to get caught?), then I suggest you give this one a pass.",1431043200,3,1180,4.232142857142857

Mireille Enos was cast in a role that was basically the reverse of her role as lead on The Killing, she was excellent as always. I cant help thinking that she should be lined up for a lot more projects than we actually see her in. Scott Speedman, a rather bumbling detective. Kevin Durand - super-creepy, like any good villain. The story provokes feelings of frustration with how law enforcement often seems to handle child abductions, interestingly emotion clouded their effectiveness here. This film is emotional and anxiety provoking, like any good mystery. It has the dead-pan presentation I associate with the movie (or television rendering of) Fargo.

The suspicion of the police and wife, and the blame of the wife were all well portrayed. Monsters like the abductors in this movie exist. The whole thing just made me want to track down the animals who do this stuff to children. I really liked the fact that the movie portrayed evil without enacting it. Viewers aren't made to watch images or scenes of horrible things being perpetrated on children; it is all left to the imagination, which is absolutely sufficient. For instance, rather than showing the screens and images viewed by a cop while he's being screened for employment on a special child-abduction taskforce, you watch his face as he views the images. His reactions are all you need to see. You know the horrors he's watching and that the monsters that perpetrate them need to be stopped. You get it when he looks away, and you get it when the screener says it's their job not to look away. What a horrible, necessary, soul-wrenching, loyal, self-sacrificing career where there really are no happy endings, just endings to awful chapters in hard, hard stories.",1430524800,,1163,4.762376237623762

Ryan Reynolds did a great job in his role, and was very believable, however it struggles to compensate for the unrealistic reaction of the detectives.

Using child pornography in this case was definitely a gimmick. It seems like they were hoping the idea of what might be happening to the girl and the children she was helping to lure into the ring would be enough to keep you from noticing that the story is a big mess. I watched the whole thing because I didn't want my mind to waste anymore time (beyond the laborious 2hrs) wondering what happened to the little girl.",1430352000,,581,4.388888888888889

6633013,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"The other night my husband and I were looking for a movie to watch on Amazon Prime, and we came across The Captive.
We enjoyed the movie.  However, it is very important to mention that it was a very different structured movie.  Unlike other movies
which would normally give you a hint when there is a flashback (some movies would have flashbacks in black and white, etc), The Captive
does not warn or hint when a scene goes into flashback.  It almost reminds me of stream of consciousness. You just might find yourself asking, ""Hold on.  Is this happening now?"" The Captive has a lot of flashbacks with no hints, but it is an interesting movie that keeps you captive, wanting to know where it is going and how it will end.  I won't say much about storyline because I don't want to spoil it for anyone.",1430352000,,801,4.421768707482993

Ryan Reynolds was a bit young for the part of the father. The script wasn't the greatest. Technology has opened new doors for sick pedophiles.  Law enforcement assumes one or both parents is guilty, so the police don't expand much effort in looking for the missing child.  The viewer gets frustrated, confused, lost,  callous, and angry,  which is exactly how I felt when my college freshman child disappeared. Perhaps the director/writer/producer wanted this type reaction. Perhaps they just dropped the ball on this movie, but I related well to the parents.  The public only sees those missing cases featured on the evening news, or on shock-strategy talk shows hoping to improve ratings.

I broke my rule here of not reading reviews first and I should have read them because wow this movie is not what it could or should have been given the storyline and the cast.  The level of incompetence of the cops in this film is astounding and I wonder if its done on purpose by the writers or no one did any proper research. The cops are spoken of like they are highly qualified but its soon apparent that they have no clue how to carry a case or follow up on glaring information right in front of them. The one time when they might have caught a huge break in the case - the female lead breaks it up and exposes everything. What an idiot and she's supposed to be the 'expert'.  None of their tech guys or nothing in their line of work has apparently ever taught them that web cams can be hacked either.  I would expect this of the civvies but these guys are supposed to be excellent at what they do (NOT!)

They have made up their minds about Ryan Reynolds and it seems nothing or nobody else matters.

This could have been a whole different film and I'm not sure where behind the scenes this went off track but it not only goes off track it goes over a tall cliff like a really bad wreck. The editing is sub par - whoever thought that it was a good idea to jump around the storyline, in the manner in which they go about it, was dead wrong in their thinking. Its not that I cannot follow it but its like a really bad book where the author has no clue how to set the storyline. They have no idea how to jump around in a story with some sort of cohesion.

There is almost no sympathy on my part for ANY of these characters, especially when no one is allowed to engage the kind of screen time or enough of the storyline, to make them remotely interesting or to care about, except Reynolds and even then its a lukewarm feeling at best.

The wife is a shrew who has spent the entire time blaming and screaming at her husband. Reynolds is the only one who actively gets on anyone's ass about the case, while she is busy telling anyone who will listen that its her husbands fault the daughter is gone.
As to fault - I was upset with Reynolds when he goes into a business and doesn't even lock the doors on his truck, leaving his daughter inside.  I personally wouldn't leave a ten yr. old in a car even if it was for a couple of minutes - but as you learn later on, this was gonna happen anyways. It could have happened in the mothers care too. Seriously though you could have taken the wife out of this film and I think it would have been better - she added NOTHING to the overall film.

The abductor who is apparently a part of a much larger pedophile ring is sufficiently creepy but once again not a well fleshed out character (no pun intended) The fact that the cops take down another local pedo who goes to jail, they then miss out on a prime chance to not only get farther along in taking down the ring but their not even checking up on what visitors this guy might have. They are aware of this ring - they even remark on how well the ring is evading them with their super encrypted system - they drop the ball in such a glaring manner every time something is not followed up by what should be in-place protocol for a unit like theirs.  So yeah research for the writers - its a thing.

The end is a joke. The cops are once again showing a level of stupidity that is just off the charts, Predictable in several parts. And apparently the last scene is there to make you think that eight years of the wife being a total bitch is supposed to magically be cured by a family hug and its ludicrous.  Personally I think there were problems in that marriage way before the daughter got kidnapped that were never explained.

There are just so many, many mistakes in this film that you could MST3k it all day long.

Save your money or your free view on Prime and watch something else. There are several abduction films that are way better than this one.

From the intensity and build up throughout the film, I cannot understand how the director/producer/whoever could drop the ball and just end it.

6633223,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"and i typically love crappy movies. But this was just too absurd. I mean really.

Ryan Reynolds gets blamed by the rookie detective for selling his own daughter because his business is failing. His wife hates him, the cops just accuse him and then fast forward 8 years and what do you know...his business is still goin. And the cops are still not looking for his daughter and his wife still hates him.
So Reynolds does his own detective work amidst repeated flashbacks that somehow are always in the dead of winter. I think they're in Ontario Canada but they act like they live in Fairbanks Alaska.
He finds where his daughter is kept and the cops instantly go and shoot the bad guy. And thats it.....Seriously, there's no resolution to any parts of the story whatsover other than the girl being found and hopefully Reynolds hates them all.
Hopefully he also hates himself for being in this horrific movie with the worst plot ever.",1429574400,39,931,4.642424242424243

Reynolds' performance was actually believable as the distraught father, but the story line was very thin.  Also, I had a difficult time feeling any sympathy for the long suffering wife.  I was wishing someone would kidnap her as her character was ridiculous and I think that the movie would have been more interesting if they had chosen a much prettier actress to play the part of the wife.  A hunk like Reynolds should be paired with an equally beautiful actor.  It would have been a better story to have the husband and wife supporting each other while they both frantically looked for their daughter together -- but, that didn't happen.  In addition, I didn't think the villain was scary enough.  I never got the point of why he kidnapped the young girl.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.

Of course, the father is suspect all along, but the ending is happy. While that may seem trite, the story is very realistic and carried out well, and it comes with a good lesson - don't leave your kids alone in the car, even for a minute.

I'd like to see a seriel killer go after sexual predators for once, or instead of a school shooting it'd be great if someone went in and opened up on a bunch of ""reformed"" rapists and sexual predators at whatever 12-step style meeting they go to with an automatic assualt rifle, sparing the therapist working with them of course ---in a movie or some other fictional narrative.

However, if a movie is going to try and tell a story in a non-linear fashion, the writers really need to make sure that method is warranted first of all, and if it is, then they should ensure that it's executed clearly.  This movie in particular failed on both counts in my opinion.  In fact, the story would have been better served had the scenes been set in chronological order.  The confusion created by the non-linear decision is what moves this from a 3.5 to a 2.5.

The fact that I'm supposed to believe Ryan Reynolds is an outdoors/rugged guy is what moves it from 2.5 to 2.

It's totally disjointed and kind of aggravating because even though this movie came out in 2014 the police operate like it's 1980.  Maybe it was meant to take place in the 80's but it doesn't say so and there are no obvious signs.  It goes back and forth, hopping from flash backs to present time, but without any clear indicators that time has passed because only the child changes, the adults all look exactly the same, so you can never figure out if it's present time or a flash back.

I don't want to give anything away, but there were a few major scenes that set up the whole premise for how the resolution of the kidnapping will take place.  None of it was used.  Nothing was resolved in the end.  I think an idiot film executive came in and said, ""The movie is too long so we're going to do a different ending.  To write this ending, I'm bringing in my idiot nephew, Joe Doofus.  Mr. Doofus will reach into his special place and yank out an ending that negates everything previously built up in many of the scenes.  The ending will just happen, like magic, because, you know, films are magical.  Everything will wrap up in about 5 minutes and will seem like the ending for a different movie.""

I rarely give 5 stars so 4 stars is definitely worth watching for me.  The plot has some depth and there are several sub-plots that are raw and real - reflective on how people actually act after a tragedies by wrongly accusing someone or placing blame on someone who is suffering a great deal already.  Ryan Reynolds does a great job and proved a new dimension to his abilities.  Kevin Durand also does a great job playing his character.  Good movie.

Films about abducted children and their captures are hard to watch especially as a parent.  I try to avoid watching them but sometimes my desire for vengeance against these monsters pushes me through such films. ""Captive""  reveals a sick side of the human race that's hard to look at. The acting is very good all around and Ryan Reynolds gives a realistic everyday man performance as a dad with a kidnapped daughter.

The film constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is an ultra eerie quality to the actor playing the main abducter and you can't wait for him to suffer or die in some way. I can't say I came away from the film ""entertained"", just reminded of the stark reality of the evil in our world. One final point.

6633957,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"I read the reviews before watching this so I was prepared for the flashbacks. Yes, there were some typical (and frustrating) themes like the little girl goes missing and blame the father. To me, the movie revolved around Ryan Reynolds, who did a wonderful performance of a tortured and determined father who was never going to give up looking for his daughter.  The pain the people who loved here felt with her going missed was so strong...you could feel it.  How does life go on after something like that?  The abductor was unusually creepy and cruel with his voyeurism.  The movie was riveting and I am glad I watched it and did not listen to the bad reviews.

It has some clumsy moments - neither of the cops is believable or competent, bit overall the movie struck just the right notes on the disgusting and evil networks of men who are pedophiles and child kidnappers/traffickers of young girls for online porn. Not surprisingly, it can be the prominent men of any town. It would've been easy for the  screenwriters and actors to go overboard emotionally on this one, but it was a fairly low boil look at how the middle class family and small Canadian town react over a decade to a girl who goes missing in the blink of an eye. My tween watched it with me and, as is often the case with pop culture, absorbed the stranger danger storyline in a way that we as parents often can't fully articulate is part and parcel of the adult male world that every young girl/woman has to come to terms with.",1427760000,3,879,4.392638036809816

After a while, you'll want to smack the people in the movie.  After watching it, you'll ask, ""Why was {insert scene name here} even in the movie. What was the point of that?"" Read the IMDB message board about this movie, and you'll see a list of issues.

Hmm.... on second thought, you should watch it with some friends while partying. Then, it could be fun as you all yell at the characters.
For a much better version of this story, watch ""Prisoners"".

You throw big names in our faces like Ryan Reynolds and Rosario Dawson and expect us to be content.  This was total crud. Please,  everyone... don't waste you're time waiting for these celebrities to deliver.  You'll waste 90 minutes waiting for something to happen only to discover nothing does.  Reynolds has some great movies.  He butchered this one.  NOTHING fits together in this movie. Anyone that rated it a five star was on the phone the entire movie and glanced at the screen between cocktail sips to catch a glimpse of the ever popular and rugged Reynolds proving he can still look good in a less than amateur flick. Okay 4 star givers...""twists"" and ""turns"" are intended to lead somehere.

I knew I liked the acting of Rosario Dawson and Mireille Enos but wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the plot. In the film a family is torn apart by the abduction of their daughter, eight years prior. Using flashbacks, you get the before/after effect. During the annual meeting with law enforcement (Rosario Dawson) to check in on any progress, they discover that their daughter has been seen alive in a bizarre Internet ring luring other young girls to their doom. As the plot unravels there are twists and turns yet it seems realistic, even as the villains are a new variety of sick and twisted.

The movie tries to be too clever for its own good, switching between the present and the past rapidly and annoyingly. That makes the story hard to follow. And the story itself is very weak and implausible. A psychopath who abducts kids and takes special pleasure in watching the parents trauma unfold. The kidnapped kid seems quite happy with her situation, except when she's not. And as another reviewer pointed out, the mother seems to be quite ok and cost with the cops who haven't produced any results for her in 8 years, but seems to hate her husband who is at least looking for the kid.

6634471,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"Disgusting, idiotic, horrible. Will never watch another film written/directed by Atom Eogyn again. His script was utterly slack. I watch a lot of movies. My husband is an actor. You look for good scripts with a beginning, middle & end. A story arc. For God's sake. This had ping-pong back & forth in time BS, people speaking at barely a whisper, detectives doing the super annoying ""comatose acting"" (that's a real style now: people meant to act like they are dead). The creep who keeps the daughter captive in order to torture her parents (& this is a ring of people who do the same thing) could not have been more icky. We quit watching halfway through because this movie was simply so disgusting, it wasn't worth our time. If you were forced to read stories like ""The Most Dangerous Game"" in high school, you've already got the idea behind this film---mental torture, sadism, glee at seeing people in hell.

The show is about a family dealing with the abduction of their eight year old daughter.  Again, the father is the main suspect but we are shown at the beginning he had nothing to do with the disappearance of his daughter.  The wife accuses him of leaving the girl for five minutes alone in the truck when the abduction happens.  Which is totally unfair.  They end up divorcing because of the strain of this situation.  The father (Ryan Reynolds) is given the opportunity to see his daughter for a brief moment, after eight years.  So he now knows she is still alive.

It dragged in places then ended too quickly; loose ends not sufficiently explained. It almost seemed like the movie could only be so many hours/minutes long and they wasted time on bland stuff so they had to hurry and end it on time.  An extended version or re-editing would fix it.

Many of the twists were unbelievable, and the dancing back and forth in time made the story difficult to follow. It was never clear as to why this 10 year old girl was kidnapped in such a blatant manner.....from the only vehicle, in a parking lot, in front of a diner with the father a few feet away, during a snow storm.

It didn't bother me cause the scenes themselves made sense and you know what the general plot is, a girl is kidnapped and detectives are looking for her. It's not a gory flick and there's not a shootout every ten minutes if that's what your looking for. I love crime dramas and this fit the bill. Even when I was getting sleepy the movie had enough twists to keep me awake in the second half. This is not a terrible movie as some are saying.

6635318,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"We generally are suspect of R-rated movies and thought maybe this movie was going to be over the top in some way due to its R rating. However, after watching the movie, we are barely certain as to why it was rated R. The acting was just okay. What was difficult with this movie was trying to figure out where you were in the timeline. The movie is centered around a certain kidnapping. However, you rarely knew if you were in a time period BEFORE that incident or DURING that incident or AFTER that incident. As far as we could tell, there were no transition markers whatsoever in the movie to communicate where you were in the timeline. It became so frustrating that it was almost funny. Definitely things could have been a lot worse in this R-rated film and we were thankful that there was no graphic display of the evil perpetrated upon the captive by the nemesis. However, the move just sort of plodded along and just wasn't all that interesting. I gave it three stars because I cannot give it 2 1/2 stars and to be kind. The writing seems okay and, as I already mentioned, the acting was fair. We were glad we did not pay money to see this movie in the theater (did it show in theaters?!) or to rent it.

This mystery has several unlikely twists and turns that will keep you interested and guessing as to what comes next.  The performance of Ryan's wife in the movie was, to me, uneven and overdone.  I don't know if it was the acting or the directing but that, in addition to the curious ending, lowered it from a 5 to a 4 for me.  I found the ending unsatisfying given everything leading up to that point.  All in all it was a good movie and certainly one worth your time.

After, I figured out the sequence, I was drawn in as to how all of the actors were linked and were at the edge of my seat.  I was determined to see it through and watch or hope that justice would prevail because it was such a horrible premise. I think the background scenery played a huge part in it and maybe because it's rainy and gloomy day outside where I live; it was the perfect movie to watch. However, I do think it worked well with the story except of course the type of business Ryan's character had in it just didn't make sense. At that point, it was just a distraction and you feel as though it was a dumb decision on Ryan's characters part on choosing a career in landscaping for the area he lives in?! It's a silly distraction but the acting was very good. After clearing up the confusion of the sequences, it was thrilling, gut wrenching and my only hope was that it all worked out in the end like any other happy ending to a movie. This was a very good movie. I'm shocked it didn't do better in the box office or that it didn't receive any more publicized recognition.

The motivation seems to be ""find the girl"" for the father (Reynolds) but driving around in circles is pretty passive for a ""thriller."" This is a movie that is TWO hours long and has pretty much nothing happen.

6635656,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"I really wanted to like this film - I had enjoyed a couple of Atom Egoyan's previous movies I saw (""Exotica"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter"").
In ""The Captive"" he goes to his signature of broken timeline to add suspense / mystery to what otherwise is a rather flat and one-dimensional plot.
The ending was especially un-satisfying - he spent so much time building the suspense and characters and finished the story in the last few minutes of the film. Even that was extended by several minutes of police station re-unification and the father driving off somewhere.

I think the director has run out of ways to exploit his signature style and it all looks the same. The same sort of thing that's going on with M. Night Shyamalan - both directors can't seem to get away from their early signature styles that made them famous.

Just like one of the other reviewer's comments, quoting a line from the movie: ""We don't need [the same] gimmick""",1425254400,2,933,4.648484848484848

However, it just seemed that several parts of the movie involved characters doing things that defy logic and some of them struck me as unrealistic. It wasn't bad enough to get me to hate the movie, it was just a little annoying. What did negatively impact my opinion of the movie was the male detective character and the acting performance given in the role. He was ridiculously serious at all times and his confrontational attitude towards Ryan Reynolds's character (because ""he reminds him of somebody"") is the absolute worst part of the movie. Totally unrealistic and not even the least bit believable that a detective would be this rude and unprofessional to the father of a girl who has gone missing.

In all, the movie wasn't too bad. Definitely entertaining and worth watching if you have some time and nothing else to do. Just wish they could have handled the male detective character differently.",1425081600,,1056,4.834254143646409

6636143,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"One of the absolute best movies that I have ever seen.  Nuanced acting, wonderful story arc.

Two problems, though:

1) There are some extraneous characters who were not fleshed out sufficiently.  Namely, the employer and the woman accomplice.  This could have easily accommodated a 2.5 hour length with the added dimension and not have diluted the movie.  Instead,  it  I was left a bit frustrated with a few questions:  Did the employer know? If so, was he part of the network or just a voyeur? Was the woman abducted by this man or another person originally? Is she related to Cass's abductor in some way?

2)  The pacing of the story is too fragmented.  I realize that the director is trying to go back and forth between past and present.  However, it was too jumbled and actually distracted from the story itself.  The viewer should be able to focus on the action on the screen comfortably, without being confused too much.  There were times when I was trying too hard to figure out past or present, which left me unable to focus on interesting details that were happening onscreen.

All in all, an amazing movie. Ryan Reynolds at his best.  Scott Speedman deliciously competent yet creepy.  Rosario Dawson flawless. I want a sequel to tie up loose ends! This movie could easily be adapted to a series.",1425081600,,1307,4.682819383259912

6636148,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Despite some of the  other reviews I thought it was borderline good.  I appreciate they could tell a story without the graphic scenes some of today's films feel obligated to show, especially considering the subject matter.  More character development of the ""bad guys"" would have helped balance the story and the ending could have been more intricate.  I don't feel like I wasted my time watching it though.",1425081600,,407,4.9411764705882355
6636149,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"""The Captive"" is a riveting drama with a thriller edge. Ryan Reynolds brought intensity to his role as the father burdened by guilt after his daughter is kidnapped. The film plays out in a series of flashbacks which provides glimpses of the heart of the story and the behavior of the actors. As it unfolds you are drawn into the anguish of the mother, played by Mireille Enos, who is filled with remorse and resentment at Ryan, holding him responsible for what happened to their child.

Although the pace of the film moves slowly, by the end of the movie the reason for it is clear. Without the deliberate slow action, it's possible that the viewer may not have fully understood the underlying reason for the title of the movie.

The film tackles a very serious problem of children being kidnapped for sexual abuse and pornography and how even the most visible persons held within the public trust to protect society can become involved in this type of activity.

While police authorities assigned to the case are obviously frustrated by the lack of clues in the disappearance of the girl in this small town, even they have no clue that the real villains are hiding in plain sight and the level of influence that they have. The two lead detectives, Rosario Dawson and Scott Speedman while working together have different opinions on how the case should be handled and harbor lingering doubts about the innocence of the father although no hard evidence implicates him.

The toll of the years that have passed since the kidnapping took place is obvious on the main actors in the drama. But the captors relationship with his captive eventually leads him to exposure because of his arrogance.

For me the real star of this film is Alexia Fast who plays the daughter who shows not only resilience and courage, but an acceptance of her captors mental state and the intelligence to outwit him to gain her freedom and be reunited with her family and continue pursuing her goal of becoming an Olympic skating champion.",1424995200,,2009,4.744985673352436

There were so many ""flashbacks"" that it confused you to the point that you were asking yourself ""is this happening now or is it  from 8 years ago"". The cops spend more time harassing the father than looking for the girl and so many plot twists just fall  short of what the producers could have done with it. The part that upset me the most (spoiler ALERT) was when the father actually gets to see/meet his daughter for the first time in 8 years, gets shot with a tranquilizer gun, daughter's gone and then says nothing to the cops that he knows for a fact she is alive or that it even happened?!

6636213,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"I very rarely write reviews but I just had to with this story. I thought the idea was original, however the delivery was poor at best and very confusing. One thing that bugs me when movies make the plot unbelievable, when you scratch your head thinking well I would never do that. When movies imitate real life (vs. sci-fi, or supernatural, etc.) you tend to root for characters that portray choices you would make if under a certain situation. Its when the plot portrays character events no human being in their right mind would do that becomes for me very frustrating. Finally, the plot is drawn out and very slow moving, not deserving of a ""Thriller"" genre.",1424822400,4,660,4.64957264957265

The kidnappers apparently use her for their own pleasure but as she gets older, they find pleasure in taunting her parents by leaving little clues related to her and video taping their torment. The kidnapped girl is even allowed to ""see"" her parents in these videos even though she is still a captive.

6636263,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"I don't understand why there are so many low rated reviews on this movie. Sure, the plot is a little ridiculous, but guess what? IT'S A MOVIE! When somebody shoots 50,000 bullets at Rambo and he doesn't die, that doesn't ruin my enjoyment of the film. If you're looking for something to kill a few hours with, you could do far worse than ""The Captive.""

Honestly I didn't know what I was getting into when I started watching this. Ryan Reynolds plays a grieving father who has lost his daughter to kidnappers. Eight years later, he drives around in the same vehicle that he owned when she was taken having lest the back seat exactly as she left it in a shrine to her memory.  He keeps in regular contact with his wife, who blames him--sometimes cruelly--for the loss of their daughter.

Really, I think it's Reynolds' performance that I found most compelling. I used to think of this guy as kind of a lightweight in the acting department, but over time I've had to concede that he's a cut above watchable. Sure, there are missteps like ""The Green Lantern,"" but that movie didn't fail because of Reynolds.

Reynolds does a good job emoting the pent up grief of a frustrated dad. He's on an emotional hair trigger and you get the sense that he's just barely holding things together. However, he doesn't seem menacing, just that he's about to go all to pieces. It's easy to empathize with him, and when evidence that his daughter might still be alive begins to mount, there is a palpable tension to see these two reunited just to end the father's suffering.

Actually, when you watch it, compare Reynolds to the actress playing his wife. She resorts mainly just to hysterics, and although her performance is effective, I think Reynolds managed to more effectively convey an existence of constant pain than she did.

Yes, like I said, there is plenty in this film that is implausible, but it's got a good cast and there are some moments of real tension. It's worth watching.",1424736000,18,1970,4.614285714285714

Nicholas Cage is married to Korean American actress Alice Kim... hmmmm... I love these creepy characters... my wife is Korean American... there's something there worth investigating. Anyway, Kevin Durand's performance is as good as the best actors that play creepy characters. The way he held his mouth was so perfectly odd. Not a violent guy (that's why the chase scene didn't work for him), but a gentle almost empathetic sick individual. That is what made it so good. Kevin Durand gets a 10 on the Creep Meter.

It is not a big Hollywood style glam-and-glitz movie but rather a drama (and somewhat of a mild thriller) centered around a very dark sociological subject and the effect it has on those closely involved.

2.  Who is the lady who showed up in the last five minutes but seems to be important throughout?
3.  The mom shows up at the station and there is the girl--happy reunion--but then....nothing.  The man throws out the things in the back of the truck? Right!

6636747,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"This movie stars Ryan Reynolds (Safe House, Van Wilder) as Matthew and Mireille Enos (The Killing) as Matthew's wife Tina, whose nine year old daughter, Cassandra (Alexia Fast) goes missing after her Dad (Reynolds) leaves her for a few minutes alone in the back seat of his pickup truck while he stops at a local (and deserted) place to pick up a pie for dessert.
**Possible spoiler alert**
Eight years later, the daughter is still missing but through scene flashbacks, the story unfolds and the audience learns that she has become a recruiter for an underground child porn ring. She, herself, had been an unwilling participant in that ring until she became too old to be in demand and so was converted to the role of online child recruiter. She has never been allowed outside and has been locked in a downstairs comfortable room in a mansion. Her captor became attached to her. Rosario Dawson stars as the police official who suspects Ryan Reynolds, befriends wife Tina.

It was difficult to ascertain whether the scene I was viewing was in the present or the past. There were repeats of the ends of scenes from different perspectives which made identifying what timeline you were viewing more challenging. I have little patience for filming ""gimmicks"" like this. I cannot abide the acting style of Mireille Enos. She overacted in this movie, which is typical. After finding out that her daughter was kidnapped, she flies into a physical rage and attacks her husband, demanding answers and accusing him of all but arranging it. Eight years later, she loses it yet again and tells him the loss of their daughter is all his fault, hating him anew. Then, when they are reunited with said daughter, I threw up in my mouth a little bit when she plasters on a too bright smile and reaches her arm out to hubby. Poor man allowed himself to be embraced by her.

The movie was intriguing at first but as it unfolded it just went downhill and landed in the cesspool of the dark side of life. Double yuk. Cannot recommend. Will never watch again.",1424390400,,2036,4.700280112044818

6637131,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"Excellent film, but my guess is that box-office-pampered folks might not think it's good. The film struck a careful balance between showing the dark and light sides of this issue without triggering the crap out of its audience. I saw in some reviews that ""the bad guy could've been badder"" or ""it looked like the girl could've beaten him up anytime she wanted"" - well, those who wrote that are blissfully naive. When this stuff happens to kids, the captors spend weeks, months, or even years convincing the children that they should stay put or bad things will happen, like ""if you leave, our people have orders to shoot your parents/siblings,"" or ""if you are bad then we will send your parents pictures of what [we make] you do,"" and so forth.

6637132,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"I never got bored, but that's about as good as it got for me.

I'm no film critic and I know nothing about acting or making films, but the flashbacks seemed a little hard to follow most of the time. I felt like I wanted a little more detail before it ended... like it was kinda half-baked. Ryan Reynolds, as usual, was fantastic... but despite his face on the cover, he's correctly listed as a 'supporting' actor. He felt 'under-utilized' to me.

The relationships between the parents, between the parents and the cops, and between the abductor and abductee all felt puzzling... as in ""I've never seen anyone act so nonsensically ever before in my life."" Overall the movie feels very disjointed. Lots of snow, but I kinda like snow, so that was fine for me. Lots of under-developed sub-plots: father gets accused of abducting his own daughter, then you never hear another word about it, or why he wasn't arrested or whatever. Father's business is failing, yet we see no sign of him struggling financially; only mention of it. Abductor has a very nice house with all sorts of gadgetry and works in a suit in an office that does WHAT exactly? No idea. His boss seems dodgy... then you never hear another word of it... the list goes on.",1424304000,,1233,4.574660633484163

6637134,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"I really enjoyed this film. I'm actually shocked at some of the negative comments however each to their own. I thought the actor chosen for the lead criminal was just perfect. I read a few people disliked him and thought it appeared the girl could easily beat him up and escape. I don't think a child who was raised in a corrupt environment filled with blackmail and sexual abuse would be mentally healthy enough to even believe they could get away.

I thought the film was put together quite well despite some comments that it was pieced together from past, present, and future. However many popular TV shows (Blacklist, Scandal) and movies (Forest Gump, Avatar, The Notebook) use this method and they use some obvious changes to the characters appearance (a different hairstyle for example) to indicate a change in time. It had my attention and I definitely felt Ryan Reynolds did a wonderful job in this role. I say it's absolutely worth the watch!",1424304000,12,951,4.763636363636364

6637150,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"How anyone could score this film higher than one is a puzzlement.  The only redeeming feature is the acting, particularly that of Ryan Reynolds.  The story, on the other hand, is like a drunken nightmare, disjointed and staggering down a dark, blind alley.  There are so many holes in the plot, that it literally falls apart when you look at it closely.  Who was the kidnapper's accomplice, for example?  Why were the investigators so dim-witted that one of them actually ended up being snatched?  How did the male culprit manage to weave into the high-class social scene so effortlessly?  This movie could have been much better -- perhaps even great -- with a little more intellect invested and some professional script editing.

6637153,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"The reviews are pretty well split down the middle for this movie, but I am glad I gave it a chance because I really enjoyed it.  Granted, the movie seems to be stuck in an endless winter, but clearly its meant to invoke the frigid, numb limbo these parents, who have had their child abducted, are trapped in.  The setting of this movie in the Niagara Falls in Canada added to the appeal of this movie for me: harsh, cold, immense and magnificently beautiful.  The setting evokes a mood, but that is probably where the haters lose the point.  Note to realists:  this is not a ""48Hours"" or ""CSI"" type of movie, where the evidence is scientifically examined and the professionals track down the ""unsubs"" and neatly tie everything up. Yes,  there are loose ends that could have been brought to some logical conclusion, but they are woven into this tale that  admittedly does take some jarring jumps back and forth in time, but they are plot twists that are not particularly hard to handle.

The cast is peppered with great actors, such as Rosario Dawson as the lead detective and  Ryan Reynolds and Mireille Enos as the parents, which is  another reason for not missing this gem.  Their acting is accused of being ""wooden"" by negative critics, but I challenge them to describe just how do parents whose child has been taken and is still missing 8 years later would behave.  The tension between the parents is palpable not only because the police are suspicious of the father but also because the mother blames him since the child was with him when she was taken.  I don't want to say any more because you should watch and decide for yourself.  Don't miss the haunting song played during the end credits, which we are given just a hint of during the movie and is another easily overlooked gem.",1423958400,2,1788,4.581761006289308

The whole mystery of uncovering who did it? for what reasons? and so on, are exciting to me.  I can think of two movies that are similar in nature to The Captive (2014), and they are The Prisoners (2013) and The Vanishing (1993).  So if you liked the last two titles, than this Canadian mystery-drama should not disappoint you.  I have not seen a lot of movies with Ryan Reynolds, and the only ones that I can recall off the top of my head are his comedic roles.  However, in this film Reynolds is great at portraying a tormented father of a young girl who gets kidnaped by a ring of pedophiles somewhere in the snowy Ontario province.  The movie jumps back and forward in the span of 8 years, as two detectives are trying to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of the nine year old Cassandra.

6637164,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"First I would like to state that IF the acting, scripting and/or directorial of this movie were bad. It STILL SHOULD NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING LESS THAN 4 STARS. Why? Due to the subject matter which it details. All of which is true and much more. Even the Who's and the How's. Those with the means and desire to traffic in humans but we're discussing CHILDREN HERE. Even with the despicable way in which the father is treated, because IN REAL LIFE. There are many (including and/or the mother's and other family members, foster parents etc.) who are guilty of those accusations even though in this case he was not.

The ratings given to this movie just shows the HEAD-SPACE in which too many live in today's. Pull you head-out-of-the vampire diaries, gossip girl, how I met your mother syndrome. We have an ashamedly growing ignorant public mind. Giving this movie such low ratings makes these people as much accomplice to the crimes presented than the pedophiles roaming this world (maybe a majority of some of the reviewers are just that, guilty). Your judgment goes too far and is very appalling.

AGAIN WHY(?) give this movie bad a review??? It's REAL and it happens the way it is depicted and much, much, much worse with not the reunion granted to the victims in the film.

I quote actress Rosario Dawson, ""You would cry if you saw what I see everyday.""

I believe it was well scripted, directed and performed. The father's unwavering persistence, the detectives resolve and especially the daughter's ingenuity by providing clues and playing her captor's faults by creating a foundation for her own rescue and gain her freedom.

The whole is decidedly less than the sum of the parts.  The film is on the verge of clicking at several junctures only to clunk to a thud.  It lurches backwards and forwards without keeping the core intact.  Great actors aren't allowed to develop their characters, which really gives the whole enterprise a two-dimensional feel.  Pacing is unbelievably slow, which can work if the storytelling is better.  I'm a notoriously easy grader when it comes to film, so I've probably overshot the average viewer by a star (or so).

There were too many illogical character interactions, too many unconnected dots, and too many unanswered questions.  Despite all that, I really enjoyed Ryan Reynolds' performance.  It was refreshing and quite a pleasant surprise to see that I love him just as much in a dramatic role as in a comic role.  However, his performance wasn't enough to save the movie.  Another disappointment was the grievous underutilization of Rosario Dawson.

There were some unnecessary sub-plots, but again, not enough to take away from the main plot and I thought Reynolds was at his best in this.  There is one scene where he is on the phone with his wife and in that scene, you can see the range of emotions in seconds rush through him.  That was powerful and so believable.  He was a tortured soul and he never lost his footing in that.  He kept me engaged as I felt what he was every step of the way.  Ryan Reynolds had me from 'pie'.  I see a REYN-aissance in his future.

6637240,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"A frozen waterfall is seen many times in 'The Captive'; it is visible through the windows of a hotel room, where Cassandra's mother is working as a maid. Years after Cassandra was kidnapped, objects with very specific emotional links to the missing girl keep turning up in that room, and she's beginning to question her sanity. Director Atom Egoyan carefully keeps that wall of ice in frame throughout these scenes. It's a powerful image. For the parents of a missing child, it's like life freezes over, and time has stopped; all that water, all that pressure, just frozen in time and space, waiting for the thaw... in this case, as the years go on, it becomes less and less likely that 'the spring' -- the resolution, a break in the investigation -- will bring good news. But in order for the waters to flow and fall, there has to be an answer: a girl who is suddenly a teenager, or a collection of bones in a shallow grave. Until then, they live life on hold. frozen in place, all that weight crushing down without relent... Or something along those lines. Cassandra's father, Matthew --  Ryan Reynolds, in a moving performance -- is tortured by guilt, ashamed that when he went into a store to buy a pie, someone stole his daughter from the back seat of his truck. In the film's standout performance, Mireille Enos (from the TV series 'The Killing') portrays Tina, a mother whose pain is so acute it threatens to destroy her; she is unable and/or unwilling to help assuage her husband's suffering, and uses that moment Cas was taken as a weapon to hurt him further, as if the more pain she can inflict on him, the less she'll feel herself. Matthew bears his wife's bitterness, and the baseless accusations, much better than most people would, I think.

Atom Egoyan's latest film returns to the same cold, starkly beautiful emotional and geographical terrain he examined in 'The Sweet Hereafter'. This film seems like a mix of the low-key art-film and a standard-issue police procedural, with odd narrative choices that leave the viewer confused. It leaves the grand tragedy of 'The Sweet Hereafter', its schoolbus full of children disappearing over an icy slope, for a more private, personal tragedy. The narrative jumps back and forth through the eight-year period of Cassandra's disappearance. In 2005, a detective named Jeffrey -- Scott Speedman -- joins an RCMP unit tracking missing children and crimes against children. His new commanding officer is Nicole -- Rosario Dawson -- whom he will later become romantically involved with. Cassandra, meanwhile, is very much alive. Having endured years of terrible abuse at the hands of her abductor, she is now old enough that he has lost interest in her sexually, thankfully. Mika is a monstrous anomaly, but incredibly, he belongs to a group of like-minded freaks in an online pedophilia ring. They have a bizarre fixation with the mundane stories of their victims, and Cassandra is kept alive to not just tell these stories to an audience of perverts, but to someday ensnare another young girl. Kevin Durand is excellent, as usual, interpreting yet another psychotic monster in an unusual way. He deserves credit for taking on such a thoroughly repugnant character in the first place. Mika is aided by a mysterious woman... the question hangs unanswered of whether or not she began as a victim herself, before turning into his accomplice. The pedophiles enjoy witnessing the agony of Cassandra's parents; Mika has installed camera's in the rooms where Tina works, and he begins leaving significant objects for her to find, and witness her pain and confusion. Matthew feels compelled to traverse the snow-covered highways, hoping for a miracle, that the next girl he sees hitch-hiking will be his daughter.

The problem with 'The Captive' is that it involves too many characters and subplots... and leaves almost all of them unaddressed. It's not that the story is over-sized or convoluted; other films have juggled far larger casts and far more complicated stories with ease. But there were obviously scenes cut from the film, in an attempt to keep down the running-time. Whatever choices were made in the cutting room, they were issues that should have been addressed in the screenplay, because you can't solve every problem with editing. Jumping forward and back in time is a device that can be intriguing, dropping clues to quickly grab attention, i.e. the early scene in which Jeffrey is interrogating Mika's boss (Bruce Greenwood, portraying one of the several characters who serve no function whatsoever, except perhaps as red herrings in a previous draft that didn't give away the mystery immediately) and the audience learns that Nicole has gone missing in 2013... but since her character doesn't appear until afterward, it's easy to miss this detail, especially if you haven't been paying attention to the dates that pop up briefly every scene. When it does rewind to 2005, it doesn't help much to propel the plot. Nicole heads up the team of RCMP detectives working on cases involving children; Jeffrey is the hotshot with the 'excellent clearance rate' who has transferred from homicide for mysterious reasons; that doesn't stop her from 'testing' him with some awful piece of child porn, then acting smug when he expresses disgust and outrage, as if he didn't realize that this would be a part of his mandate in a squad investigating child abuse. Then both Jeffrey and the viewer meet the eclectic group of cops on the team, in the contrived manner of NCIS or CSI: Miami -- the tech guy, the science guy, the pattern recognition guy... wait, the what? So they dump out a large puzzle on the table in a jumbled mess, and he soon describes in detail the finished picture on the box. 'That's impressive', says the new guy. Sure is. Too bad this 'pattern recognition' character does absolutely nothing through the rest of the film. There are other examples that I won't get into, for spoilage reasons. Needless to say, I was surprised by the seriously flawed story-telling; the chronological confusion is exacerbated by the number of 'jumps' - 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2013... it's an amateurish mistake. Maybe I expect too much from Atom Egoyan. Usually, I associate Egoyan with prestigious, artistic film-making, but I don't think that reputation exists south of the border. In Canada, he deserves as much credit as David Cronenberg and Denis Villeneuve for establishing a Canadian cinematic identity, for 'Exotica' and 'The Sweet Hereafter' alone. But that was a long time ago. If I didn't know that Egoyan directed this film, I probably wouldn't have been so patient with the disjointed, off-putting mess that is made of the story. There are inconsistencies in the tale that no brilliant performance, no poignant visual metaphors can balance out.

Nevertheless, it's beautifully shot, it has deep emotional resonancy, and it's suspenseful, even if it's not prime Egoyan; if you're willing to be patient with an often frustrating narrative, it's worth watching.",1422576000,17,7026,4.971938775510204

6637264,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"I'm not familiar with Atom Egoyan's body of work, but I was aware that his recent films haven't been too well received, this one included. THE CAPTIVE has some great, lurid subject material but it lacked any emotional depth and its non-linear construction does more to hurt than help it. The basic story is that Matthew Lane's (Ryan Reynolds) daughter disappeared eight years ago, but tantalizing clues keep popping up that seem to indicate she may still be alive. One thing I think was done well was the way in which the villain was portrayed. Normally, this type of movie would be sort of like a whodunit, but instead you get a pretty good look at what a child predator is like. Too bad that character motivations are never really explored beyond a father desperately wanting his child back, and the non-linear structure absolutely kills any character development as you never see the progression the characters take. There is also very little suspense due to this same thing, and to make matters worse the way in which things are wrapped up was a little too clean in my opinion. Not that there's anything wrong with happy endings, but for such a downbeat movie I expected something a little more bittersweet. However, despite the story problems the film was generally well-acted, except for the actress portraying Matt's daughter Cassandra (Alexia Fast). Something about her line delivery was just off. Ryan Reynolds gives a pretty good serious performance and Kevin Durand was wonderfully off-kilter and creepy as the villain. Mireille Enos (the mother) was ok, but I didn't particularly like when her character resorted to the typical hysterics. It was a little too over the top, to be honest. However, the real standout in the cast was Rosario Dawson. The parts of the story which focused on her cop character were the most interesting to me. In regards to technical aspects, the film was well-shot and had an interesting visual style. The entire film takes place in winter, and there were lots of beautiful shots of snowy landscapes. The score was decent too, and fit the material rather well. Overall, this was a well-made film on a technical level but it has some story and character issues which make it less than it could have been. I'd say that this is something you would be justified in skipping, though, especially when there's better similar films, like PRISONERS.",1420761600,,2380,4.879012345679012

But the time spent developing the characters and building the story seemed almost wasted on the anticlimactic ending. The whole complex, twisting, captivating movie just comes to a screeching halt with an all too quick and simple resolution. And I'll agree with other reviewers, the cops are the worst part of the movie. It is immediately apparent that they suspect the father of playing some roll in the girl going missing and despite zero evidence and some pretty petty reasons for their suspicion they act on that notion throughout the entire movie. And the argument they have in front of the open laptop/ webcam IMMEDIATELY after video chat with the suspected kidnapping ring gets terminated has got to be one of the dumbest things they could have ever left in the movie.

6637327,1,B00NAQ3EOK,"The plot? Reynolds has the worst landscaping job in the world in permafrost Canada while Enos is the worst housekeeper in the world, spending her days pacing instead of cleaning hotel rooms. Both are unhappily married since their daughter was abducted while he bought pie. Enos overacts and screams at him for years while ignoring the incompetent police detectives who take turns in acting as a therapist to her and general pain in the ass to him. Hope is almost gone for the missing kid - and the audience - when a stereotypical child abductor hatches his master plan that has something to do with 1990s chatrooms and the Internet. And somehow he also put cameras in all the hotel rooms where Enos works. Meanwhile two police detectives spend times ewwwwing each other with sicko pictures instead of 'detecting' and seem to do everything other than solving crime. All of this happens in snow.

The film cannot decide what to focus on so it just does everything all at once, $4.99 buffet-style. We get some half-baked attempt at a police procedural though clearly the writers have never seen any other cop show let alone researched actual police work, so the twist is that the police are incompetent and just continuously harass the father of the missing kid. Then we get the half-cocked ""my kid is missing"" emotional story from Reynolds and Enos, neither of which has any material to work with and quickly exhaust the generic misery setup. The bad guy really isn't bad enough and looks like he could have been beaten up by the kid at any time if she'd just wanted to leave.

It's hard to put into words how bad this is but needless to say that The Captive manages to misfire on all cylinders at once. In taking an amateur script that should have never made production, it adds some wooden acting and risible dialog from actors who can do much better, and finally edits the mediocre result together with time-jumping tricks that are completely out of place in this sort of mundane made-for-TV story. Without a single likable character in the film or anyone behaving consistent with logic or reason (even the kidnappee seems pretty happy), it's a two-hour exercise in eye-rolling, face-palming and shouting insults at the TV.

If you hang in there hoping at least for a satisfying ending, disappointment is served in spades. The filmmakers, knowing that even a big train wreck has to end somehow, opt for the least plausible way to put this fire out - I shouldn't say too much in order to keep this spoiler-free but I just want you to know it doesn't get any better. In a year of pretty dreadful movie choices generally, The Captive will hopefully be first in line at the Razzie Awards. I would like to know how the bad guy got a power source to all those hidden cameras though.",1420156800,500,2777,4.663265306122449

It almost forces You to rewatch the film a second time for the events seen early in the movie to make any sense.  But it jumps so many times, and to so many different past points, that all it ultimately does is confuse.

Most surprising was how poorly Rosario Dawson, Scott Speedman, and Bruce Greenwood come across.  All three are strong actors, yet not one of them makes a dent here.

The film's sole recommending asset is Ryan Reynolds.  As the desperate broken man whose daughter is the films titular captive, he gives one of his career best performances, and single-handedly redeems this film (and earns it the three stars I give it).",1420070400,,757,4.57037037037037

I re-wound and fast forwarded trying to make sense of it, but I really hate multiple time lines and alternate story lines. Especially when the movie never comes together. I'm waiting for the sequel when the parents are found to be making extra cash off the daughter instead of the kidnapers.
It was almost a ""groundhog Day"" where the director and writer kept re-writing until they got an ending. Maybe they ran out of money, and had to stop filming.",1420070400,7,798,4.580419580419581

6637372,4,B00NAQ3EOK,"Very good thriller that captured some very real aspects of child abduction.  The creepiness of Kevin Durands character (Mika) was complete.  He did an excellent job of portraying a sick twisted person.  It was a bit disjointed and it took a while to realize which scene was the past or present or a past scene that was before or after a different past scene (you can see how it gets confusing).  However, I was ultimately able to make heads and tails of it.  I thought Speekman's character (Detective) was a bit TOO antagonistic towards Ryan Renold's character(Matt).  However, my biggest gripe about the movie was they did not explore other characters and sub plots.

Who was Bruce Greenwood's character (Vince)?  Was he just the CEO of the company that Mika worked for?  Was he himself an abductor?  They certainly alluded to the possibility:  Mika started working FOR him at 15 years old.  At the benefit dinner they gave each other a few ""knowing"" glances.  Who was the woman with Mika (Vicky)?  When did Mika abduct her?  How did he turn her to work WITH him?  Was there a network of ""subscriber's"" watching Cass's mother (Tina) in the hotel rooms?  There were a lot of frustrating unanswered questions.

Then there is another aspect that does not reflect how I rate a movie at all, and maybe I am in a very small minority of people who would like to see this done more in movies like this:  I wish they would show the psychological effects on the characters after they've been rescued.  How did she (Cass) adapt to a normal life?  How did she do in school after that?  How was her emotional maturity and how was it stunted by an experience like this?

I guess I can do my own research of real life situations like this to learn of this, but I still don't think it would add a lot of time to the movie to do this more often, and maybe it wouldn't be interesting for most of the audience.  I know it's not essential for the plot, but I do think it would be a fascinating epilogue.

6637392,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"EXCELLENT film; writing, directing, acting all solid in my opinion.  I was glued to the television from beginning until the very end.  I'm so glad I didn't listen to negative reviews. I have been a fan of Atom Egoyan ever since his first film debut, ""Exotica"".  All of his films have been thought provoking, gripping, dark, and unsettling.  They all deal with a most difficult reality, one that none of us likes to think about, particularly those with children of our own; sexualization of children against their will.  It was no surprise to me to discover that he started out as a Stage Director.  I will admit it was difficult at times to follow the film in terms of time and space; past and present were hard to distinguish one from the other.  There were a few details about this film that did not make sense; for instance when the father discovers his daughter is missing why did he not look for footprints in the snow?  This would have been the first thing any person in their right mind would have considered right?  Easy for me to say, because clearly the guy was not in his right mind.  Also why did we not get to see police show up and look for clues, i.e. footprints, tire marks etc.??  I love Mireille Enos.  Watched her in ""The Killing"" and have followed her career also.  She was excellent in the role of the mother.  Even though Reynolds and Enos were not well matched as husband and wife, Reynolds gave a solid performance as the father.  Overall brilliant film, but one you really have to be in the mood for.  Not the kind of film you sit watching over popcorn.",1419638400,,1578,4.445993031358885

Thus begins a riveting, tale of terror and breakdowns. The father has a record. One for assault. He and his wife are broke. He's a loser, and now he's lost his daughter, whom he adores.

It's a tense subject that I would recommend for adults, perhaps teenagers.

6637434,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"A GIMMICK YOU DON'T REALLY NEED

""The Captive"" is not your usual ""B"" film kidnapping/imprisonment film. The beginning is a bit confusing as it utilizes flashbacks which I didn't realize for the first 30 minutes, making this film a confusing mess to begin with. I will briefly sort out the first 28 minutes of the movie. If you don't want to know...stop reading.

Cassandra (Alexia Fast/Peyton Kennedy) goes missing from the back of her daddy's truck cab. Matt (Ryan Reynolds ) her dad becomes suspect number one to the Niagara group ""Anything For Love"" headed by Nicole (Rosario Dawson). Matt's wife Tina (Mireille Enos) blames him and turns against him. Jeffry (Scott Speedman) who is part of Nicole's group is openly hostile toward Matt.

Cass has special privileges as a captive and provides her captor with a unique service which makes this film a bit different. Matt tries to find Cassandra on his own (better than when OJ went looking for the ""real"" killer) while the group works without Matt.

The film makes for a good ""B"" movie. It over utilizes the flash backs and really should have never had the flashback scene near the end which had me scratch my head...but wasn't she? How did? Oh a flashback. Of what? A day? A gimmick they really didn't need. Or was it a trick?

A four star film that was cut to three stars by the director and editor.

6637455,5,B00NAQ3EOK,"Notice that the creep in this movie takes pleasure in watching the mother's anguish. He not only spies on her in the hotel rooms, he also gaslights her by leaving a hairbrush and a tooth in one of the rooms, so he can watch her reactions on video. This guy is not only into kidnapping little girls, he's also into emotional and psychological mind control. He is in control of the girl, the father and the mother. It makes him feel superior. It's thrilling to him. He enjoys it. He's the cat toying with the mouse. The puppeteer controlling the puppets. The ultimate reality entertainer. Real people are his dolls. He is playing doll-house. Dressing and undressing his ""dolls"" as he sees fit. (This guy is not a man. He is a creep). ""Watching mommy twist."" ""That's not a bad idea for a reality show.""

The entire cast did an awesome job in the roles they each played. This isn't an action film, is it an honest, heart moving story, about loss, grief, and the personal struggles of not only the family but the dectectives who have been left to deal with this kind of situation. What matters the most about this movie is the ending. Everyone comes home... Most of the families who have found themselves in this situation do not get this kind of blessing. They say the first 24 hours after an abduction are the most critical in finding a child. Imagine if you will, eight years, eight years of not knowing anything. I can't even begin to understand how in real life these families can go on after something like this happens... Well Done Mr Reynolds and all of those involved in the making of this movie.

But near the end, it's as if they looked at the clock, and said, ""oh shoot, we gotta wrap this baby up, we've run out of time, run out of good writing, and there's no more budget"".  My wife and I each looked at each other at the end and laughed--not the reaction the producers wanted.

6637461,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"I went back and forth on giving this one or two stars.  In the end I gave it two as it was artistically shot and the acting was quite good.  Otherwise . . . I just could not like this movie.  I understand what they were trying to do but the basic plot has rather large holes in it.  The way it is shot back and forth over three different time periods with absolutely no indication of switching from one period to the next could have been interesting but quickly got tiring.  It was very difficult to have empathy for any of the characters - the bad guys were really really bad so I guess they got that right . . .  But the father mostly came across as a loser, the mother rather insane, the police officers against the parents . . . just not a lot to root for here.  They ended the movie obviously trying to not have it be a ""Hollywood ending"" but ended up just kind of dragging it out.  I guess it did a good job in really trying hard to install fear in parents, but even that was based around a situation full of plot holes.  So, I really can't recommend this one - which is a pity as I like Ryan Reynolds and can see he was going for a role in what was supposed to be a much darker, artistic ""serious acting chops film.""  I almost wish it had been a bit less interesting so I would have stopped watching it rather then continue all the way through.",1418860800,9,1351,4.02621722846442

6637467,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"Where to start. This is one of those annoying movies that uses the gimmick of  going back and forth in time. and they do that a lot, almost like they are purposely trying to confuse the viewer. It has Mireille Enos, you know her,  she's the woman who is now typecast to be in any story that has to do with missing kids. Then there's the guy who almost could pass for a party of 5 era Matthew fox. The pedophile is stereotypical and well played by a guy whose name I don't know.

Actually the acting itself was ok I guess, it's the script they had to deal with that was bad. You will never know how or why the abduction
took place and the bad guy takes some actions that are just unbelievably too risky. The real star of this movie was Carhartt and their excellent
jackets. I think everybody wore at least one piece of it.

I found it overall to be a rather boring movie that I had to pause and take breaks and come back to later. I couldn't imagine watching it in one uninterrupted viewing. I give 2 stars for the acting and 1 star for the Carhartt attire. I actually own that jacket!",1418688000,113,1084,4.147619047619048

6637470,2,B00NAQ3EOK,"Stranger danger. Creepy opera fans (and by the way, if you're going to use Mozart as your musical motif, don't just rip off the best songs from Amadeus--dig into Wolfie's catalog a bit, won't you?). Snow. Lots and lots of fluffy Canadian snow. What should have been gut-wrenching was plodding and passably dreadful. Had this been in the service of information, or even drama, it might have been OK, but like the ice-slicked roads of the Great White North, there was nothing here to provide traction. It appeared to be at least three separate and only occasionally parallel stories, but the editing booth was attacked by honey badgers and the resulting scraps had to be assembled at random.

This is not a terrible movie. Elements of it, in fact, are excellent--although much of what's good in ""Captive"" has been done better elsewhere. My only real complaint is that it's not entertaining. Now. I don't demand that every movie I see BE entertaining. I loved ""Tim's Vermeer,"" and that was a documentary about a man trying to copy a painting. But if a movie is going to be billed as some kind of ""thriller,"" it better conjur up more emotion than an Oxygen drama.",1418688000,4,1159,4.70935960591133

With a very captivating atmosphere and incredible actors, he gets you into that long-term chase against twisted minds. Not falling into too much of black and white, he manages to make all this true and both disturbing.
We can only regret that it stays a bit classic in the treatment and that the end falls a bit rapidly after a brillant part of action with Ryan Reynolds and the cars battle. Probably not as incredible as Prisoners last year but still a great piece of cinema.",1418515200,2,553,4.711340206185567

6637476,3,B00NAQ3EOK,"This was a very slow drama that was hurt severally by the back and forth time changes in the first part of the movie.  Very poorly edited and kept the viewers confused as to what was going on.  Also the writers had Scott Speedman's cop so dislikeable that they probably could have dropped the role from the film and not hurt anything.  What also hurt the back and forth time changes was that there were no apparent changes in looks or dress of Ryan Reynolds during the 8 year gap.  You couldn't tell by looking at him that you were in one period or the other, it all looked the same.  So too for the rest of the characters.  He played a father who stops at a roadside diner to run in and get a cherry pie for desert that night and when he returns to the car his daughter has been kidnapped.
Eight years later they still haven't found her.  For some inexplicable reason Speedman's character is sure that Reynolds did it himself.  Not a bad flick, but certainly dry.  Maybe interesting for those that enjoy that style of film.",1416441600,2,1024,4.319371727748691
