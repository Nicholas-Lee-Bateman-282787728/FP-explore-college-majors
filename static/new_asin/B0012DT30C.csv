""Maghreb"" with its supposed emphasis on Fez and its exotic medina, it's medieval ramparts, dazzling tile works, ancient, but still-viable tannery,  narrow cobbled streets and high standing as a world heritage treasure, is SO POORLY PRESENTED one might question just how many minutes the film-makers spent there.  I was born and grew up in Algiers, the heart of the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia).  The people there, both Arabs and Berbers, are, they will tell you, North Africans, not a bit like Middle Easterners.  That is, having survived and been influenced by repeated invasions (Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Arabian) they are tolerant, literate, warm, funny and eager to please.  My latest trip to Fez took place this past fall.  In the inner city--the old town or medina--you find yourself hurled back through the centuries, to the age of water clocks, Maimonedes (his visit and the house in which he resided are proudly hailed as a highlight of a tourist's tour) as are the mansions, palaces and secluded gardens of the early caliphates.  Very little has changed: the stench of the tannery, the enticing aroma emanating from the public bread ovens, the scent of orange blossom water, all blending flawlessly with the colorful swaths of silk peddled along with pottery, brassware and silverware in street corners, not to mention the flower stands and dazzling tiled fountains, window frames and occasional wainscoting everywhere ... And then there is the glorious symphony of people and animal sounds uninterrupted by the intrusive ruckus of modern day traffic.  AS THE CAMERA HOPPED FROM THE THE MEDINA OF FEZ TO ITS WIDE SURROUNDING HIGHWAYS AND MODERN CITY, FAR TOO LITTLE OF HISTORIC FEZ WAS PORTRAYED IN THE MOVIE. CERTAINLY IT WOULD NEVER HAVE TEMPTED ME TO GO THERE.  Which is a shame.  Because discovering Fez is a lot like falling in love, deliciously serendipitous.",1391212800,,1918,5.099041533546326
