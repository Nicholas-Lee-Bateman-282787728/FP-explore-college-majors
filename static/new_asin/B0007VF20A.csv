8052233,4,B0007VF20A,"LONE COWBOY stars John Wayne in three of his early hour-length cowboy movies, plus a  ""modern"" non-western about trouble on the tracks.

THE HURRICANE EXPRESS is a Tully Marshall 12 chapter serial that was whittled down to 80 minutes for television. The Duke as third banana is out to revenge the death of his railroading father. An intense search for ""The Wrecker"" is complicated by his foe's ability to disguise himself as almost anyone.

THE LAWLESS FRONTIER teams Wayne and 'Gabby' Hayes in a pursuit of Mexican outlaw Pandro Zanti, who both killed Duke's parents and wounded Gabby.

In THE STAR PACKER Sheriff John Travers (Wayne) battles ""The Shadow"" and his gang of terrorists.

THE TRAIL BEYOND has Rod Drew (Wayne) searching for a missing miner and his daughter. After Drew locates a map to a goldmine, he has a dangerous gang to deal with as well.
