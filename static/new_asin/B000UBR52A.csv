Now, for the first time on convenient DVD, you can see how Johnny's expertise as a trader and his insight into the human heart transform the shy and awkward Mahana into a beautiful person worth much more than the eight cows he bargained with.

2920185,5,B000UBR52A,"Got this set for my Mother, who has been using the original Johnny Lingo film during her family counseling sessions.  To have the original in DVD format is great.  Also, she enjoyed the other 3 family movies that are included.",1388361600,,226,4.625
2920186,5,B000UBR52A,"Good stories, good values, good for families.  Wouldn't hurt anyone to see these and pass them on.  Love the morals of the stories.",1378339200,2,131,4.6521739130434785
2920187,5,B000UBR52A,Don't let the fact that these films were produced by the Mormon church.  They are very outstanding moral stories and although rather old now they are still very usable in motivational settings.  I use them at youth camps in training the counselors.,1376524800,3,248,4.880952380952381
2920188,5,B000UBR52A,"I love the story of Johnny Lingo and some of the other stories on this video.... been looking for it for a long time.  Glad to have it home and on my shelf... the story of Johnny Lingo is actually a story about the self-worth of a woman.  Johnny pays 8 cows for Mahanna, Moki's daughter, whom many believe is the ugliest girl on the island.  But Johnny has loved her since they were children and to him she was always beautiful.  When Johnny and Mahanna leave the island on their honeymoon, they return later and everyone sees what Johnny saw in her all along---a radiant, blowing beautiful woman whose beauty surpassed that of the other women and girls.  The old trader on the island asked Johnny what happened.  Johnny said in her father's hut she was not valued... when he paid the 8 cows, she brecame an 8 cow wife and KNEW she was valued and could then have the radiance to show it.  Johnny was neither vain nor a fool... he loved Mahanna enough to give her back the self-esteem her father stole.",1375488000,2,1001,4.378378378378378
2920189,5,B000UBR52A,"This is a movie classic, it has not been digitally remastered.  Perfect for that old time movie feeling. Loved it !",1371427200,,115,4.476190476190476
2920190,3,B000UBR52A,"I have seen this many years ago a number of times. However, the
""treatment"" of Johnny's future wife by her father is a little harsh and
outdated for our time. It has a good moral  but the treatment of women
is kind of from the past.",1360108800,,232,4.043478260869565
2920191,3,B000UBR52A,Jonny Lingo is a story adapted from a magazine article from the 50's that brings to a mans mind his responsibility to be a loving mate. Jonny Lingo is the one movie I wanted and the only one I can speak to now.,1358726400,,210,3.9069767441860463
2920192,5,B000UBR52A,I have only seen the Johnny Lingo movie and really enjoy this old classic. We use it in our quit smoking class to help with self image.,1349308800,,135,4.037037037037037

8212820,3,B000UBR52A,"I bought this mainly for the short, ""Christmas Snows, Christmas Winds"". I was absolutely thrilled by the sense of nostalgia it evoked -- until -- about 5 minutes before the end when it suddenly veered off into a different direction. There was some foreshadowing of events to come, but I felt the ending soured what had come before. Your mileage may vary.",1448928000,,354,4.725806451612903

8212823,5,B000UBR52A,"I have always enjoyed Johnny Lingo & now days it seems a little cheesy, but the message is still valuable.  The Mailbox is truly a downer!! Uncle Ben was OK with predictable but happy ending. Christmas Snows Christmas Winds was also a real downer!!  Depressing & left you feeling hollow. Only Johnny Lingo is worth watching.  Too bad we can't buy it as a stand a lone movie.",1419638400,,374,4.470588235294118
8212824,5,B000UBR52A,"Love Johnny Lingo & the Mailbox--the other two, not so useful.  Great for Sunday Schools or if you want something appropriate for a sleepover for kids.",1410048000,,151,4.8076923076923075
8212825,4,B000UBR52A,"The original Johnny LIngo movie is great. The Mailbox is a super slow, pokey movie that drags. Havent' seen Uncle Ben yet. Bought it for Johnny Lingo so it's serving its main purpose.",1407110400,2,183,4.575757575757576
