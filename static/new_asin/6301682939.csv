7814348,5,6301682939,"""MTV Internacional"" called it ""The Argentine Blade Runner"". Whereas the compliment is appreciated, I wouldn't go that far. When watching this film, you must make allowances: Argentine film studios do not have the billions available as Hollywood does, to make a movie with ""Star Wars"" special effects. Argentine thrillers and action films cannot compare to the planetarywise, superior US products, however, just as with any foreign film, you watch it for the story, not for the car crashes or sex scenes (there are none here). Charly Garcia acts as... well, himself, in this movie. All the music was composed by him, and in 1994 when I went to Buenos Aires, I walked all over town visiting all record shops I could find searching for the soundtrack of this movie. I found it in the form of a cassette. To this day it has never been released on CD, and if you are lucky and have deep pockets, you can probably find it on eBay. I sold about 12 crappy CD on eBay in order to buy my copy of the LP. Worth it! This film has not (to my knowledge) been officially released on DVD. For now, we'll have to do with the blurry VHS version. My recommendation: Buy it. It'simpossible to download it from bit torrent sites, and chances are, most of you will never visit Argentina, so grab this one while it's still available. watch it for what it's worth; entertainment made in a post military dictatorship 3rd world nation with foreign debt, social and political problems at the time of its making. A glance into a possible alternative universe future that could yet become true.",1189641600,2,1565,4.633093525179856
7814349,3,6301682939,"Gustavo Mosquera directed this Argentine movie, one of his earlier movies. He's a jack-of-all-movie-trades guy as he writes, directs, produces, edits and does camera work. You could say he has a feel for moviemaking. This movie is a slow paced thriller, very slow. It only picks up towards the end for the climax. It is obvious that it was made nearly 20 years ago but any comparisons to the classic ""A Clockwork Orange"" are pure hype. The story tales place in Buenos Aires and the first thing one notices as Miguel, the main character roams the city is the lack of people. Immediately one wonders, very low budget? However the script quickly, check that, slowly reveals more sinister goings on. Political graffitti on the walls shows displeasure with the police state, drawings of lobotimized heads indicates somethings awry. Miguel is accidently shot by the state and is hospitalized in a coma of sorts, he hears but can't express himself. His thoughts carry the dialogue at times. Interestingly enough a male nurse is privvy to the shady goings on under the state at the hospital. The male nurse is none other than the veteran Argentinian rocker Charly Garcia. Charly Garcia also does the musical score for the movie and although slightly dated it helps an otherwise dreadfully slow movie movie along. The question one asks themselves when watching is when will he come out of the coma? You know, the revenge factor. It takes a loooooooonnnnnnnng time, by then it is the climax and if you put some water on your face you'll catch the end. There are some other goings on in between, of some merit as Charly Garcia is a bad-good guy who is out to harrass the police state cop responsible for Miguels unjust coma. Considering the political climate in Argentina at the time I guess this was a statement movie of, what else, times to come. They could have come up with a more bleak future, more violence, or something to spice it up a bit. I got tricked by reading somewhere, maybe the cover, that it was the Argentinian "" A Clockwork Orange."" Oh yeah, it's one of those mostly in the night movies. If you want a little action, very little, some retro-futuristic rock soundtrack to drift off into the sleep world, then put this on before bed. Recommended for insomniacs.",980726400,3,2268,4.72979797979798
