8460645,1,B0057FGCLE,"If you want to see one of the worst movies ever produced,then go and buy it. I could not believe the stupidity of the script or the production.  There were three well known people in it who should have turned the roles down.  If your under thirty five you might enjoy this garbage. Note that I said, might.  It rates right in there with Kubricks Clock Work Orange or a Woody Allen Movie.  In trying to answer an age old question that no one will ever now he answer to, it created  a new description for the word lame. If you really want to watch it, I would suggest you watch it on cable or wait until it is in the $2 dollar rack at Wal-Mart",1367712000,,641,4.055555555555555
8460646,4,B0057FGCLE,"Very funny/quirky satire. It makes light of all sorts of situations including: suicide, the apocalypse, and false prophets. I'm not saying it's the funniest film of the year or deserves to win any sort of award, but it does the job it sets out to do. Give it a chance and you'll be pleasantly surpised.*Note* This is a dark humor, so if you're not into that sort of thing just skip it.",1355097600,,385,4.361111111111111
8460647,5,B0057FGCLE,"In the first few minutes of the film, you know it is going to be a quirky indie filled with symbols and metaphors. The title of the film is a double homonym. There are also religious symbols with the names of Gabriel(messenger of God) and doubting Thomas.

Philip Katz (Joseph Cross) reminded me of Neil Patrick Harris in this film. The planet earth is going to come to an end because of the sun, yet it is business as usual. Politicians are worried about re-election and corporations are more concerned over profits than prophets.

Philip meets a street beggar/philosopher named Gabriel Peterson (Danny Glover). Gabriel dubs Philip ""The Son of Morning"" similar to the ""son of man"" title. Gabe spouts modern day slogans and truisms at Philip who stops taking his stress pills. During a church service, blood comes out of Philip's eye. He is immediately taken by a reporter (Heather Graham) and is proclaimed the messiah who will save the planet.

The film is overwhelmed with themes of aforesaid corporate and political wants, but is also critical of the media, the no talent celebrity status and those that cling to them and exploit them.

Religion is used as a template for the film, but I didn't see it as being satirized. The film incorporates numerous techniques to imitate the stressful and confused mind of Philip, most enjoyably, a giant Gerbil.

Smart, clever, filled with symbolism and metaphors for today's time. Not for everyone. If you like quirky films such as ""Chumscrubber"" you might want to view this one.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, brief sex, brief nudity, drug use.",1344729600,,1582,4.884328358208955
8460648,2,B0057FGCLE,"There are no real laughs found in this short piece (actual story time is 69 minutes).  Cross' character walks through the movie in a daze, at the mercy of the opportunism of every other character in the film.  There is no character development and it is difficult to care about anyone in the story.  I agree with the former reviewer that the film's intro held great promise, but the payoff from this setup never materializes.  2 out of 5 stars.",1320796800,,444,4.5125
