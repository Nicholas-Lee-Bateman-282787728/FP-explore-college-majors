8641619,5,B00IEPIYCO,"The programs I have watched so far have been as good as I remembered they were.  However, at least one of the disks (#4 for the first season) was damaged so badly my DVD player can't play it, so I will need to return it.  I haven't checked out the other seasons' disks yet to see if they are all in good condition, but after I have played through those programs, I will return whatever disks I need to.

Remind me of the procedure for returning damaged DVD's;  do I return just the damaged disk or disks or do I send back the complete season for you to replace?
