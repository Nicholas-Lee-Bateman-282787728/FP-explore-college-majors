8092927,4,B000BUICZO,"I saw this movie on cable and was delighted when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, the movie on the DVD has been censored: after Michael and Faith went on a date, they returned home and ended up on the couch kissing passionately (no nudity at all) when they are interrupted by the phone ringing (Brenda calling). Brenda asks Michael what he is doing and he says ""Nothing (much)"" or something like that. Of course this breaks the romantic mood and Faith goes to sleep. This scene lasts probably 20 - 30 seconds, but some idiot (....) has deleted this scene on the DVD.

But of course when you look at the back of the DVD cover you'll find this: ""Feature Films for Families - Strengthening Traditional Values Through Entertainment"".  Morons.",1233187200,4,738,4.6692307692307695
8092928,4,B000BUICZO,"One thing is absolutely clear in this movie; little Lily is really hurting from the loss of her mother in a automobile accident.  A little less clear is that her father, Michael, deals with the loss by throwing himself into his work as if that will cover up the pain.  The movie would have done well enough to just leave it to that, and how the understanding baby-sitter, Faith, helped both come to positive terms with the death.  Instead, they throw in a gold-digger woman after Michael and even a romance with the new nanny.  For families that have lost a parent, however, the movie should serve as a tool to help everyone get to talking about how they feel about the death.  For families that haven't lost a parent, it could provide a 'road map' of how they should deal with such a possibility.",1174867200,6,797,4.468965517241379
