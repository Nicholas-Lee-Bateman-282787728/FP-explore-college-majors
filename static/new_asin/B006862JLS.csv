Piled high with the actions that you would love to see parents do to their kids out in public or what a parent would love to do if they could get away with it.,1339891200,2,272,3.6271186440677967

8494613,5,B006862JLS,"This is the best three seasons of The Boondocks. This has great value and will continue to have such value especially after season four flopped; I don't even consider season four canon as the creator bailed on it. These three and that is it. I quote Huey, ""I'm retired!"".",1412899200,,271,4.551020408163265

8494620,4,B006862JLS,"Been invited to the party, but I was still late to the party! People have been telling me about this show for a while, but I never really paid it much attention. I remember seeing the comic in the newspaper, but I never really understood the point of it. I downloaded the episode Smoking Wit Cigarettes & The Fund Raiser in 2010 & I was hooked. The Boondocks is a great animation program. I could see the point the staff was trying to make with Smokin Wit Cigarettes. My girlfriend & I started to download the rest of season 3, Fried Chicken Flu & Date With. Booty Warrior being her alltime favorites. We downloaded all of season 3 except The Story of Johnny Rebel. After watching season 3 over & over we eventually got season 1 & 2 on dvd. This show is great & we look forward to season 4 & the feature film of The Boondocks. People often to compare it to Southpark & Family Guy because they are all animated series, Truth be told The Boondocks is more in league with Peanuts than any other animation I have seen. I see where Aaron McGruder gets his influences from.",1364083200,,1067,4.313432835820896
