I own a rabbit and only 10 minutes were dedicated to Rabbits.  (the same comment can be made about the coverage of mice, gerbils, and guinea pigs also covered in this video).  Granted, it was very informative but it leaves you wanting to find another video to see more.  In my case, there aren't any more.
The video is narrated by a nice gentleman whom obviously cares very much for his pets (the true stars of the video).",975110400,8,542,4.39
