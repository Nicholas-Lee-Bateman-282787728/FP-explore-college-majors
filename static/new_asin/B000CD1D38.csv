2752354,1,B000CD1D38,"If you are looking for a particular movie titled HELL'S BELLES,then you need to be careful because there are at least five or more movies out there with this title.
The video cover that they are showing here of a guy sitting on a rock in front of flames while a girl with a devils tail stands in front of him is NOT the movie I got when I ordered this. That movie is rated ""X"" and is Directed by Ed Hansen (PARTY PLANE, BIKINI CARWASH CO.) and stars Terence Cooper and Martin Howeller. It was released in 1997. That is what I thought I was getting when I ordered this movie.
Instead, they sent me a movie that was released in 1969 rated ""M"" and was directed by Maurey Dexter and starring Jeremy Slate and Adam Roarke. I haven't viewed it yet but apparently it is a late 60's biker movie.
The main character wins a new motorcycle and has it stolen from him. He spends the rest of the movie trying to get it back .",1206489600,5,912,4.129213483146067
8173683,4,B000CD1D38,"Good movie. He wore down a whole gang in ""his backyard"". He wore the ex-girlfriend out by showing mercy to those he had defeated. But then he refused to help the guy who stole his motorcycle. That cost him something more precious than the motorcycle. She would have lasted longer than the motorcycle possibly. She was one nice looking lady. No sex and no guns in this. That was a surprise.",1470614400,,389,4.492957746478873
8173684,2,B000CD1D38,"late sixties biker movie, bikers riding Triumph 500's. And of course the acting was bad, plot was predictable, and the bikers were the bad guys. One of a thousand. It was Great.",1462147200,,177,4.5625
8173685,3,B000CD1D38,"Could again have used a ""half star rating system, although I feel pretty good with my ""3"".  Typical mid to late sixties movie, corny, but somewhat entertaining!",1444176000,,160,4.925925925925926

8173688,3,B000CD1D38,Typical campy 60's biker flick. The soundtrack bumps it up to a solid 3.,1431820800,,72,4.214285714285714
