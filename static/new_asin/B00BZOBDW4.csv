8575907,5,B00BZOBDW4,"Excellent cast -Kaufmann, Gheorghiu and Terfel can all  act as well as sing. Very well staged with an orchestra that does its job .

In my opinion this is the best Tosca video on the market",1385769600,3,189,4.222222222222222
8575908,5,B00BZOBDW4,"Which is good because I don't have a Blu-Ray machine.  But the performance was marvelous.  Kaufmann was especially brilliant.  He's a terrific actor in addition to the beautiful voice.  I know Gheorghiu  is supposed to be great too, but I've never been a fan of hers.  Terfel made a completely repellent Scarpia - perfect. The whole thing together was terrific.  Buy it.",1381881600,3,370,4.870967741935484
