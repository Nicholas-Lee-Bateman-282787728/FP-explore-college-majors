295826,4,6300269418,I'm tempted to give this mid 1960s offering a 5 star rating if only for Newmans performance as the laconic Lew Harper but it would unfairly elevate a fair script into something it is not. That being said Harper was somewhat typical of the 60s product coming out of Hollywood at the time. To quote Harper ! Now theres something all clean and bright! or words to that effect it portrayed a small glimpse of what at the time was considered to be 60s hip which Newman had down pat. Newman and Mcqueen had the field pretty much to themselves during this period with this film being one of Newmans better offerings at the time. It was to his credit that he included pal Robert Wagner in a supporting role after Wagner had tasted some lean years. Wagner recognised the chance and took full advantage producing a better than average performance in the process and propelling himself back into more challenging roles as a result. The supporting roles are all well cast in this fast moving story with Strother Martin giving a standout effort. Lauren Bacall and Pamela Tiffin add some eye candy to a plot that bounces along without many noticable bumps and keeps the who done it buffs guessing for most of the film. One could say in overview that the film works despite a rather flimsy and predictable script and that is perhaps the kindest accolade we can give any film. The sight of Tiffin doing her boogaloo on the diving board is one that lived long in my memory. A pity that we did not see more of this undoubted eye catcher who had an all to brief career. There are many briliant one liners in the movie made even more memorable by the Newman magic. Who can forget lines such as ! Ah it stiffens ma chewing gum! or in response to the barman exclaiming to Newman the fact that there was no change from a round of drinks ! Keep it anyway! In conclusion Harper rates highly as a somewhat clever offering made to work by equally clever actors and one that can be enjoyed over and over. What else can one say.,1119484800,5,1999,4.420054200542006
295827,2,6300269418,"There are a lot of excellent actors in this but overall ""Harper"" is an embarrassment and I would not be surprised to learn that one or more of them have used their power to keep this production from being released as a DVD.

Newman is great, although he is not given much to work with.  He saves what he can by sticking chewing gum in his mouth whenever a gap appears in plot or dialog, or direction.

Ross MacDonald is not easy source material to adapt but this was a total hatchet job on his ""The Moving Target"".  The opening shots by the pool totally change the story by overlaying a playboy bunny image on what is supposed to be a complex young lady.  It is hard to watch without wincing.  A Hollywood proforma extra love interest is stuck on the Lew Archer character, ringing like a cracked bell of cliches.  All the complex characterization of the novel is ditched in favor of formula and that doesn't work since we jump unmotivated from one sketchy scene to the next.  The screenplay drops the money motive within the family almost entirely, and leaves much unexplained by introducing characters such as the servants, who behave suspiciously, to a prejudiced view, and then leaving their purpose in the plot unused and unexplained.

It's a mess, but maybe rent it for a look into the atmosphere of another time and for  nostalgia for Southern California in an earlier uncrowded era.

I invite someone else to try to adapt MacDonald.  I'm waiting for my copy of ""The Drowning Pool"", the other VHS.",1118188800,3,1503,4.588014981273409
295828,5,6300269418,"Harper may, perhaps, be the best detective film ever made. I don't mean police detective, I don't mean proper british detective, I mean honest to goodness American private eye style detective film - yes, I'll go that far. HARPER IS THE BEST DETECTIVE FILM EVER MADE. That's quite a claim when you consider there's some fairly tough competition, like Altman's The Long Goodbye, Hawks' The Big Sleep, Murder My Sweet, The Maltese Falcon, Laura, Kiss Me deadly, Farewell My Lovely (the second Mitchum stab at Marlowe, The Big Sleep, stinks, however)... I could go on. While some of these other films may be better FILMS (I don't know how this could be, exactly, but it's true) none of them is a better translation of the private detective persona, the feel of the America detective story, the mindset or outlook, the style. A lot of this has to do with paul Newman's acting. It also has a lot to do with the humor. The odd, contentious relationship between Harper and his ex-wife is revealing and unique. The many characters harper runs into while investigating his case are compelling and multi-layered. Harper is a perfect mix of good, solid filmmaking and a straightforward translation of the private detective genre (as practiced here in America). There's just something about this film. Even the ending is unique. I won't spoil it for you, but the last little thing that Newman does and how it reveals a certain facet of his character, his relationship with his friend, and the ambiguous moral world exposed by the detective genere is quite memorable. Add to that an excellent supporting cast, with actors such as lauren BaCall, Robert Wagner, Julie Harris, Shelly Winters and Janet Leigh, all of them portraying interesting, complex characters, and you have a real winner. You may disagree with my asssesment of this film - that is is the BEST detective film ever made - but there's no denying that it's at least ONE OF the best. Another thing I really like about it is that while it's based on the John MacDonald detective Lew Archer (from the novel The Moving Target) it also is very reminiscent of Philip Marlowe, mainly because of the attitude that Paul Newman brings to the role, and the seamy, corrupt world that is uncovered, complete with a weird religious cult in the mountains led by the late, great one and only STROTHER MARTIN! Yes, this movie is absolutely essential to any collection of detective films and it is a literal CRIME that it is not on DVD in a first rate edition. Shame, shame, shame on the industry!",1111190400,7,2529,4.763097949886105
295829,5,6300269418,Harper is a very slick movie! It is funny and it kept me guessing until the end. Paul Newman is at his best in this very entertaining movie! The only question I have is...when is this great movie coming out on DVD?!?,1083456000,3,216,4.166666666666667
295830,5,6300269418,"This is the second Paul Newman movie I saw, and it's become one of my favorites. It's also one of his best performances. This is the story of Lew Harper- cool, laid-back, gum chewing, good-looking L.A. detective. He's been hired by wealthy Lauren Bacall, who wants Harper to find her missing husband. Also features Robert Wagner, Julie Harris, Robert Webber, and Shelley Winters. The supporting cast is very good, but it's Newman who grabs my attention. He steals every scene. A cool classic from 1966.",1060041600,2,502,4.91764705882353
295831,5,6300269418,"Newman is best when he shows humor with fun action. This is a fun film. When do you think a DVD will come out? There's a lot of garbage out on DVD, but this is actually worthy... especially since most of the cast is still around to give great commentary. I really love this film! Let's rally for a DVD!!! UPDATE: It's October, 2006 and still no DVD. Newman's ""Hombre"" has been out for a while (made the same year). ""Harper"" is a lot more fun. Better cast...everything... NEW UPDATE 10-27-06: The DVD will be available in a few weeks, and I'm quite thrilled. 2.35:1 LBX and everything like the glossy Hollywood film that it is. Anyone remember Newman saying ""Uh... you must be physic...""?  ANOTHER UPDATE: I finally have the DVD and it's great, with a terrific widescreen.",1059782400,9,771,4.546762589928058
295832,4,6300269418,"The music, the cars, and the size of Pamela Tiffin's bikini (not to mention her hair) are the big giveaways that this is a Sixties Flick - but one without the usual camera trickery so fashionable in those days. Instead, director Jack Smight goes for a straightforward private eye approach, although the colour and California sunshine rule out any chance of Harper becoming a latter day film noir.
Paul Newman is the title character, a seedy and cynical private eye investigating the disappearance of a singularly unloved millionaire. That Harper is seedy is amply illustrated under the opening credits. His cynicism is repeatedly demonstrated in William Goldman's terse and cutting dialogue, which Newman clearly enjoys delivering.
The plot frequently takes a back seat to the parade of offbeat characters portrayed by a cast of equally offbeat co-stars. Their performances range from very good (Lauren Bacall, Arthur Hill) to barely adequate (Robert Wagner, the aforementioned Ms Tiffin) with one (Janet Leigh) seeming to have wandered in from another film altogether.
But the film belongs to Newman, clearly in his prime and in the midst of a remarkable run of films with titles beginning with ""H"" (Hud, Hombre, The Hustler). If some elements of the film have dated, his performance has not. A terrific film for anyone who enjoys Newman, private eyes, or just good solid movie-making.",1022630400,25,1386,5.164444444444444
295833,4,6300269418,"This movie runs too long for it's own good ,butPAUL NEWMAN gives a valiant try at portraying a private detective hero. What i like best is the supporting acting, especially SHELLEY WINTERS who seems to play a character close to herself. The inevitable comparaison to the private detective heroes of HAMMETT and CHANDLER did not help this film. Still,it was the best of it's kind in the sixties. Fans of this kind of movies should also take a look at TONY ROME with SINATRA and MARLOWE with JAMES GARNER.",986947200,3,503,4.662921348314606
295834,3,6300269418,"I really enjoyed watching Paul Newman in this film.  As always Newman found new life to breath into yet another classic role.  Unfortunatly the fun ends here.  I thought the plot of this movie  was rather average.  I suppose it wasn't really bad but it could have been so much more.  Harper is a detective, who apparently needs some work.  He finds it through a recomendation from an old buddy, locating a lost rich man for his jealous wife(she thinks he has run away with another woman).  Many characters come into play as this mystery of the missing millionare starts to unravel and eventually Harper figures out he has been kidnapped by some of the low-lifes he had been consorting with.  And the rest of the movie is downhill from there as it did not seem surprising or original.  Additionally it was a slow picture.  However, Newman is fantastic and for that reason this movie is worth seeing at least once.",972864000,2,912,4.60248447204969
295835,5,6300269418,"Paul Newman plays the title role of the world-weary detective in an updated (1966) version of a 1940's detective story.  This is much more, however, than Newman trying to fill in for Humphrey Bogart.  The movie  intrigues the viewer from the start.  Harper's personal life is a shambles,  and his wife wants a divorce.  Harper's professional life isn't any better,  and money making cases are rare.  At one point early in the film, Harper  explains why he keeps at it and doesn't give up.  He recalls a time when  there was a peak of short duration when everything went very well, and that  made all the valleys suffered seem worth the struggle.  Amidst all this  brooding and angst, a job materializes via a lawyer friend.  Harper rouses  himself, finds a tie and one last clean shirt, and drives out of the city  to a private estate of the very rich.  And thus begins a bewildering tale  of kidnapping, betrayal, murder, and complicated characters.  Newman does  well as the cynical private detective with a sarcastic sense of humor.  The  supporting cast is a gold mine of familiar faces:  Lauren Bacall, Robert  Wagner, Julie Harris, Arthur Hill, etc.  Nobody is what they seem.  Some  are evil while others are merely foolish.  Either way, the people he  encounters do nothing to change Harper's low opinion of the tapestry of  life and its various characters.  This movie will please viewers who enjoy  hard as nails mystery stories that stress gritty reality rather than fiery  explosions, frantic car chases, and mow-'em-down with automatic weapons  shootings.  Paul Newman fans will be pleased by their favorite actor in one  of his best roles. Multiple viewings of the movie will increase the  appreciation of plot twists and evolving characters.  Definitely  recommended.",948412800,18,1782,4.948805460750854

It's extremely well directed and acted, and there are all sorts of great actors in this flick: Lauren Bacall, Arthur Hill, Robert Webber, Shelley Winters, Julie Harris, Pamela Tiffin, Strother Martin, as well as a young Robert Wagner who plays a quietly pivotal role. The story line is excellent, having been well adapted from the book. And what can I say about Paul Newman here? I've seen a number of his pictures, but I love the way he plays the character of Lew Harper, a very much down and out Private-eye. He is killingly cynical in this flick which adds a great deal of humor to a fairly seedy and realistically done crime mystery. This is an older picture nicely transferred to DVD.

Solid acting and film-making all around, even noir queen Lauren Bacall shows up in a scene stealing role.  Standout performances include Newman, Julie Harris, and especially Janet Leigh.

He is as dull as dull can be and can't even be compared to the hard, dark edges of such superb PI's as Bogart and Mitchum's Philip Marlow or Nicholson's Jake Gettes, or even Michael Rooker's Frits Brown (in Brown's Requiem 1998). To make it worse Lauren Bacall is the same old snobbish stuffy boor, Robert Wagner looks like a Ken doll with equally matching doofus wits, and the alluring sexpot is such an amateur it is doubtful she could seduce a cat to a bowl of milk. And then there is the story - same old theme that is here, there, everywhere, but, where it should be. A half hour into it we didn't even care what happened to the kidnap victim and then when we saw the guru on the mountain we laughed so hard thus so much for wasting another moment on this piece of wasted celluloid.

296161,3,6300269418,"A landmark motion picture, HARPER came about when producer Elliott Kastner and writer William Goldman decided to adapt one of Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer mysteries in order to create a new kind of Hollywood movie. One of the most popular and best mystery writers of the day, Macdonald's Archer novels had progressed by the 1960s from their very Chandleresque overtones to become very sophisticated studies of psychology and moral complexity; but this wasn't what Goldman and Kastner were after. They turned to adapting the first of the Archer mysteries, THE MOVING TARGET, to re-create the Hollywood detective thriller with a new emphasis on grittiness and machismo: thus the film features its detective (re-named ""Lew Harper,"" for reasons that continue to be debated) moving in a very seedy milieu, involving drugs, illegal aliens, and torture, and uses language that was considered very edgy for its time (including, unfortunately, derogatory terms for gay men and for women that were not common in movies of the time).

It's undeniable that HARPER, which was a huge success, was enormously influential and not only helped pave the way the next year for BONNIE AND CLYDE, which of course ushered in the so-called ""Hollywood Renaissance"" of the late 60s and early 70s. Moreover, its success had a huge influence on detective movies and shows of the coming era, with its particularly vicious thugs, its high-speed auto chase near the end (though the one in Steve McQueen's BULLITT was even more influential), and its hero's dodgy personal living situation (which must have been noticed by the creators of THE ROCKFORD FILES). But despite its popularity and the trends it set, it doesn't age very well, particularly in its attitude towards women. Almost every major female character in this film is extensively disparaged at some point for not being attractive enough, which seems a bit depressing given how much more complex Ross Macdonald's female characters, and the attitude towards them shown by his Lew Archer, had become by this time. There's a whole cavalcade of celebrity actors of the time playing minor roles, from Lauren Bacall, Shelley Winters, Janet Leigh, and Robert Wagner from the world of Hollywood to Julie Harris and Arthur Hill from Broadway. Bacall (whose presence winks back to THE BIG SLEEP) and Wagner fare the best, since they have the most fun with their parts, while Julie Harris makes a particularly unconvincing drug-addicted jazz chickie-baby (with exquisite stage diction). Although this was one of Paul Newman's most popular turns, he does little to convince himself as Harper, who here has annoying predilections for affecting terrible fake accents and for getting beaten up--he must get conked on the back of the head about three different times.",1408147200,,2780,5.164079822616408

296260,5,6300269418,"The Private Eye Genre had a virtual renaissance in the mid sixties to early seventies with Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer joining the spy craze created by the popular James Bond films.  It wasn't long before studios started fishing for other properties introducing us to Matt Helm, Derek Flint, Bulldog Drummond, Tony Rome, and now Lew Harper brilliantly played by Paul Newman.  The film is based on a novel by Ross Macdonald but has a wonderful entwining script by William Goldman who scribed many a popular film in his day.  As in all private eye films , Harper gets hired upon recommendation by Lauren Bacall to find her missing husband and suddenly, a routine case becomes a convoluted web of intrigue involving adultery, thievery, and human trafficking.  Newman was always the master of subtlety in his acting but never more in this role as he swaggers and strolls through each set piece working for the greater good.  Harper is not the alcohol, angst ridden gumshoe we were used to, this guy will do anything for the greater good sacrificing his marriage and friendships to get his cases solved.  The brilliance of Newman's acting shows in one particular scene when in the office of his elderly attorney friend played by Arthur Hill, he comes across a photograph of young Pamela Tiffin who is Bacall's daughter. Realizing she is his mistress and young enough to be his daughter, Newman expresses revulsion and envy all in one delicious smirk establishing his character in mere seconds.  Besides the people already mentioned , the film also has great work by Shelley Winters, Robert Webber as the slimey husband, Strother Martin in a ahead of its time role as a religious cult leader, beautiful Janet Leigh as Harper's unfortunate wife, Robert Wagner and Julie Harris who steals the film in an ultimately tragic performance.  The film boasts great time capsule photography by Oscar winner Conrad Hall, a great jazzy lounge score by Johnny Mandel and flowing direction by Jack Smight. Its a shame that it took over a decade to see a sequel, Director Stuart Rosenberg's 'THE DROWNING POOL' again based on a Ross Macdonald novel but this film is owned by Paul Newman who gives life to a complicated ,no holds barred hero and 'HARPER' belongs in every detective film lovers collection.  Warner releases the film in its original theatrical widescreen 2.35 ratio showing the brilliance of Conrad Hall's images and has a nice commentary by scribe William Goldman, a beautiful intro by Film Historian Robert Osbourne and an original theatrical trailer for the films initial release.",1324080000,2,2579,4.951388888888889

The best thing here is the excellent transfer to dvd, an unusually fine job. The film looks great, and brings across that swingin' '60s vibe all the way. The colors! The crazy proto-hippies! The lack of traffiic on every L.A. freeway!

But alas, the not-so-best things include two hours that start to slooow about halfway through; a weak plot that hardly helps the time move; some pretty insipid acting, including blue eyes himself, who gets by on charm and looks; and an overall feel of popcorn flick without much to lift it into greatness.

Goldman's script has some nice dialogue but is also heavy-handed at times, and strays a little too far from McDonald's original ideas. Wagner and Leigh etc have moments but it all feels a little soap-opera fake at many points. Newman is crisp as ever but I was reminded of his lack of range...he was in fact a movie star first and an actor second, and while he's fun to watch, he sure ain't no Olivier, or even Bogart.

Speaking of which, there's nothing much noir about this, whatever some say. There are some nice oblique camera angles, and some jaded weltschmerz, but there's little real menace and too much light cheese for that real gritty noir feel.

I enjoyed the scenery and was occasionally amused, but by 90 minutes I was just waiting for it all to come to a vaguely unsatisfying conclusion. Which it did, but after too much time.

Worth seeing for the period photography and the cuteness of Newman and Wagner, but not too much else.",1309305600,4,1497,4.630188679245283
296263,4,6300269418,"If you're into gritty 60's crime dramas, you'll get your money's worth with Harper (1966), a long and complicated tale with film noir elements that weaves between opulent affluence and the sleazy underside of LA.  Paul Newman stars as Lew Harper, a private investigator just scraping by, called in to look into the disappearance of a wealthy businessman, who may have been kidnapped.

Adapted for the screen by William Goldman (Misery, Marathon Man, All The President's Men) from a novel by Ross MacDonald, the film features a marvelous all-star cast that includes Lauren Bacall, Shelly Winters, Arthur Hill, Robert Wagner, Pamela Tiffin, Julie Harris, Janet Leigh, Robert Webber, and Strother Martin.

The intricate tale begins with Harper being hired by Mrs. Sampson (Bacall) to check into the whereabouts of her husband Ralph, who was last seen by Allan Taggert (Wagner), the pilot of his personal plane.  Harper's buddy, attorney Albert Graves (Hill) is Sampson's attorney, and has the hots for his client's twenty something daughter Miranda (Tiffen), who happens to hate her father.  Harper's investigation leads to a washed up actress (Winters) and her gun totting husband (Webber), a drug abusing lounge singer (Harris), a religious nut (Martin), and other assorted colorful characters.

Harper drives an old heap, isn't good at fighting, and treats his wife Susan (Leigh) who is about to divorce him, like crap.  He is however one cagey detective, with determination, a quick mind, good looks, and a glib tongue.  Harper may not always look smooth, but he gets the job done.  The case is a complicated affair that features several interwoven threads that lead the detective far and wide.  What starts out as missing person's investigation, turns into a kidnapping, spiced with human trafficking and grand theft, and punctuated several times with murder.

From start to finish, the film almost exclusively follows Harper's activities.  Even under that kind of scrutiny, Newman's performance is rock solid, interacting with the many illustrious talents who all also deliver strong performances.  William Goldman's screenplay holds together quite well, as the mostly gritty tale has only a wacky religious angle as a distraction.  The often snappy dialog is also one of the strong points, helping to facilitate the elaborate plot, and contributing to the film's earthy vibe.  Probably one of the best films of this type made in the 1960's, Harper would later be followed by the sequel, The Drowning Pool (1975).  The primary extra is a commentary by Goldman that while sporadic and kind of meandering, still provides some interesting information about the film, and his writing career.",1297900800,2,2690,5.25
296264,5,6300269418,"Of all the kinds of roles Paul Newman had done up to the mid-1960s, including even as Billy the Kid in the late Arthur Penn's 1958 western THE LEFT-HANDED GUN, the one he hadn't been able to get his hands onto was that of a private eye, the kind of role that Humphrey Bogart did so well in the 1940s, especially with the immortal THE MALTESE FALCON.  But in 1966, Newman got the opportunity to do such a role, in a contemporary fashion right for the genre and the time it was made, and managed to give one of his coolest and most scintillating performances.  That opportunity was HARPER, based on writer Ross MacDonald's Lew Archer character in the novel ""The Moving Target.""

Here, Newman finds himself working, at the urging of a good friend of his (Arthur Hill), a case in which a millionaire named Ralph Sampson has been missing for twenty-four hours, and where nobody knows, or more to the point is unwilling to reveal, his whereabouts.  While investigating, Newman comes across some fairly unsavory people: the millionaire's airplane pilot (Robert Wagner); a nightclub singer and ex-junkie (Julie Harris); a fading starlet who has put on some pounds (Shelley Winters); a ""holy man on the mountain"" (Strother Martin); and an unscrupulous business tycoon (Robert Webber) involved in smuggling in illegal immigrant workers from Mexico.  All of them have had a hand in some way in what turns out to be a kidnapping in which the missing millionaire's life is at stake with a $500,000 ransom.  In his own world-weary, cynical way, Newman manages to crack the case wide open--but with a somewhat tragic irony, as the millionaire evidently had a way of alienating everybody around him, including his wife (the legendary Lauren Bacall) and flirtatious daughter (Pamela Tiffin).

Under the professional direction of Jack Smight, and with a cagey and sometimes quite funny screenplay by William Goldman, HARPER is a very solid crime drama, with a masterful performance from Newman, among the finest he ever gave, especially during the 1960s.  He is also helped out by plenty of superb supporting performances, including Webber (who often refers to Newman as ""Old Stick""), and Martin in one of the many roles that earned him a vaunted place in the pantheon of all-time great Hollywood character actors.  Johnny Mandel's jazzy score and the brilliant cinematography of Conrad Hall, who later did COOL HAND LUKE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (both with Newman), IN COLD BLOOD, and AMERICAN BEAUTY, are the topping on the cake.

With the obvious exception of his official debut in 1954's THE SILVER CHALICE (which he ""apologized"" for when that film first aired on TV in 1963), Newman always gave everything he could to a film; and better than 90% of the time, he succeeded.  HARPER counts as one of those incredible success stories, both on an artistic and on box office level.  It is definitely one of the best crime movies of its time, and, really, of all time.",1288137600,,2960,4.862823061630219
296265,4,6300269418,"""Harper,"" the cool 1966 mystery noir, has always been a pet favorite of mine. I have never considered the film dated more than it perfectly documents a glorious time and place - the underbelly of Los Angeles decadence a year before the Summer of Love. The locations are memorable, the cast extraordinary and you have Paul Newman at the peak of youthful prowess absolutely nailing the role of Lew Harper, a black-suit-wearing private eye with a wisecrack for every situation.

The character is based on the famous Lew Archer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Archer-Files-The-Complete-Short-Stories-of-Lew-Archer-Private-Investigator/dp/1932009639/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Archer Files, The Complete Short Stories of Lew Archer, Private Investigator</a>) novels penned by Ross Macdonald (based on his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Moving-Target/dp/037570146X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Moving Target</a>, with a screenplay by a youthful William Goldman&nbsp;]), and it's telling fans of the series are also fans of this film. Newman, usually chomping gum, is hired by a wealthy heiress, the wonderfully serpentine Lauren Bacall, to find her missing husband in what appears to be a kidnapping. There's a suspect next to every pool, including a tanned Robert Wagner as a good-natured playboy, curvy Pamela Tiffin as the sexy daughter, distinguished Arthur Hill as the best friend, a smooth Robert Webber as a sinister business associate, Shelly Winters as an alcoholic former actress, Julie Harris as a tough-as-nails dame and even Strother Martin as a robe-wearing religious guru so popular at the time.

This has got to be one of the most likeable casts in all of history, storied professionals participating in an update of the greatest of genres - the private eye mystery. There's a flippant disregard for American convention - marriage, love, romance, family bonds - and all shirts are eventually dirty. One of the film's great scenes, a moment I recall in every detail to this day, is when Newman, after a night of surviving near-death, ends up on his ex-wife's doorstep. Janet Leigh reluctantly opens the door and allows him to spend the night. The morning after, she is cooking a grand breakfast of bacon and eggs, a loving smile on her face. Maybe this time it will be different. It's not, as Newman immediately leaves, obsessed with cracking the case, seemingly trapped by the walls of her apartment. Leigh angrily stabs the yokes of the eggs and refers to her ex as a ""lingering disease."" It's one of the most emotionally truthful scenes ever filmed about failing relationships.

Other scenes stand out in this well-produced maze with eschewed camera angles and cynical facade. Director Jack Smight, still in his youth before succumbing to the big bucks of routine disaster flicks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport-75-Ws/dp/6304843267/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport 75 (Ws)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damnation-Alley-VHS/dp/B00000F31K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damnation Alley [VHS</a>]) keeps the action moving with energetic style. I like his framing of the obligatory chase scenes, in addition to a wonderfully shocking conclusion that's a perfect close to such an unconventional attitude (even for 1966). Some credit must be given to cinematographer Conrad L. Hall, one of film's great visionaries and just a year away from his ultimate work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Cold-Blood/dp/B0000AN4JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Cold Blood</a>.

For an actor such as Newman with so many great films on his resume, ""Harper"" may not even rank in the top 15. But it's one of only two characters this incredible icon would play more than once (move over Fast Eddie).

I won't tell you anything about the plot because anyway it is not a plot. A rich man who is trafficking in illegal immigrant smuggling with a fake religious pure angel is kidnapped for half a million dollars because of some kind of love affair or love escape, plus some drug on top of it all and you have it. Add to that a rotten something and a decaying something else and you have it twice as well. Oh, I forgot the happy widow who has done nothing wrong except expecting that wrong to happen and a daughter who is flirting with every man around, younger or older, who cares. That's really the slowest and most superficial private eye story you could think of. Yet Paul Newman, still young in the profession and directed like some kind of puppet on a stick is doing a good job of it so that the whole paraphernalia and hullabaloo becomes nearly natural and enjoyable. But if it were not for him that would be a vain little film with no depth whatsoever. The sightseeing around Los Angeles is rather mediocre too. I guess I must sound slightly negative about it all. Well, let me tell you something that is no secret. I am and I am glad I am. Too bad for Paul Newman. After all he had to make a living before making a career.

The New York Times called Macdonald's work the best set of American detective novels. As usual, the movie isn't quite up to the level of the novel, but it is very good.

The movie takes place in mid-1960s Southern California. The plot concerns an alcoholic millionaire who disappears. The man's bitter wife hires private eye Harper to find him. Typically for a Macdonald novel, the case takes Harper to the seedy underside of the California dream. Harper tells a great story.

Paul Newman plays Harper. Predictably, his private eye is cooler, funnier, and less world weary than is Macdonald's p.i. The supporting cast is excellent - Robert Wagner, Shelley Winters, Strother Martin, and Janet Leigh. One disappointment for me was Lauren Bacall; she's one of my favorite actresses, but the script doesn't give her enough screen time.

296320,1,6300269418,"The social ferment of the '60s was a great stimulant to pop music--but for Hollywood movies, not so much. Maybe because it took a heck of a lot more money to produce a movie than an LP. Movie producers with big bucks on the line shied from anything radically new, or fatally watered down anything true to what was going on out in the streets. Certainly lots of '60s movies just embarrassed themselves trying to be au courant: Peter Sellers movies like ""The Party"" and ""What's New Pussycat"" come painfully to mind.

Sadly, ""Harper"" is one of those. It's a tedious, embarrassing mid-sixties updating of the whole Raymond Chandler L.A.-noir genre, with Paul Newman in an off-kilter performance failing to find a way to play a hip '60s version of Sam Spade cool. (Steve McQueen managed it beautifully a couple of years later in ""Bullitt."")

That failure of translation--from Chandler's dead-pan '40s to Byrds-era psychedelic '60s--is ""Harper"" all over. Lauren Bacall's classic narcotized, narcissistic poor little rich girl, in ""The Big Sleep,"" is updated here to a vacant hipster-chick doing (ouch) the boogaloo in a bikini at the end of a diving board. Newman's Harper trades drinks for info with Shelley Winter's blowzy booze-hound at the requisite dive-bar-with-character; soon they're out on the dance floor fruggin' (wince) with the kids. Dives-with-character don't HAVE dance floors, and they certainly don't have house bands that look like Tommmy James and the Shondells.

Really, I have no idea what movie most of the four and five star posters here are talking about. I saw ""Harper"" recently at the American Film Institute's fine theater outside Washington, and even though I'm a Newman fan and was in a sentimental mood following his sad passing, I walked out half way through. I just couldn't take it anymore.

Just rent ""The Big Sleep"" or ""The Maltese Falcon"" for the fifth time--or try ""The Late Show"" or ""The Long Goodbye,"" more successful '70s turns on the same Chandleresque base material. But stay away from this one.",1238284800,5,2031,5.0
296321,5,6300269418,"Harper is one of those movies that makes practical spiritual sense to me. The movie develops people's attitudes and the flow of facts the way these things would develop in a real investigation. How do I know -  I was a policeman for 30-plus years. It's a movie about people who can afford a private eye and an expensive attorney. The kind of people that don't want to live their lives in the same manner that they want everyone to think that they do - rich hypocrites. They pay enough to get the job done right but somehow fail to inspire loyalty and trust.

Harper does his job, gets his butt kicked, kicks some butt and figures out that old friends, who have saved your butt, are more important than ethics or philosophy! In the end, Harper knows a little more about who he really is. More importantly, he gains clarity from his interaction with some bad people rather than from an intellectual pursuit.

Hey, it's an entertaining movie about a kidnap/homicide. The victim is a rich man who plays with the wrong crowd and looses. It's about an LA P.I. that isn't taking pictures of guys cheating on their wives; at least at the moment. It's an old time detective movie set in the late fifties or early sixties. It has a great list of actors. The architecture is great too!

If you like it - the sequel is ""The Drowning Pool!"" You might want to try China Town, The Two Jakes, LA Confidential and the Black Dahlia too.",1233100800,5,1418,4.4423076923076925

While the movie is dated and sexist, it is well worth viewing, not just for Newman's charismatic performance but for some brilliant supporting roles. Janet Leigh plays his bitter estranged wife, Shelley Winters is poignant as a sloppy barroom slattern, Robert Wagner is a breezy, easy and amoral but hides an unexpected secret. Best of all is Lauren Bacall who purrs, growls and hisses in a scene stealing performance as the cynical woman who enlists Harper's services.

The new DVD release is a joy: the incredibly cinematography looks gorgous, the award-winning soundtrack pops, and the commentary from William Goldman adds new insights to this unappreciated classic.

Harper is a classic, very funny, character-driven private eye yarn with a great cast set against the hopped-up world of mid 1960's LA. Sure, maybe a few things are dated but this film stands up very well after more than 40 years. The truths of Harper (people are crazier than bedbugs, they lie, surface appearances deceive, but once in awhile honor prevails) remain valid. More important, this film is ""a gas"" (in 60's parlance) to watch.

Peppered with witty dialogue and immersed in the sex-and-drugs cult weirdness of mid-sixties California, ""Harper"" is directed with flair by Jack Smight.

At any rate, it was a fun movie, not only because of its storyline, but also because of the cast:  Paul Newman, Shelley Winters, Julie Harris, Robert Wagner, Janet Leigh--all in top form and having a blast with their noir roles.  Newman is the lead and with his charming ways he keeps you entertained the whole time.

The story revolves around the kidnapping of an obnoxious zillionaire and the questions, of course, are--Who among the totally nefarious cast of characters is/are involved and, Will Newman get the criminals before they ""do in"" the kidnap victim?

Along the way, we see all sorts deliciously seedy sections of L.A. and encounter numerous colorful characters.

R. Baker's Rule--""Just about everything-be it film, book, play, or party-is 20% too long""--applies here. A few mintues trimmed out of this film would definitely have increased it's star rating by at least .25!! :)

296348,3,6300269418,"So, at some point in the sixties either the people who watched films or the people who made them grew tired of the same film-noir/detective films that had been around for ages featuring stars like Humphrey Bogart.  As a result, the detective movie changed, and the focus was more on making the lead character cool or funny or tough.  Some of these new films were good (the absolute best is Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"" with Elliott Gould), some were not so good, and some were just in the middle.  ""Harper"" falls in the middle.

The basic premise is that you have a private investigator, played by Paul Newman, who's hired to find a cheating husband, but when he starts digging around he find the husband isn't off with a mistress--he's actually been kidnapped.  Eventually Newman gets mixed up with a bunch of shady characters (a gigolo, a drug addict, a washed up actress, a shaman, etc.) and a plot to smuggle migrant workers across the border from Mexico.

The plot is this type of movie is always convoluted.  ""The Big Sleep,"" is one of the best detective films ever made, yet there are large plot holes.  What really makes the movie worth seeing is whether or not the stars can keep you entertained.  ""The Third Man"" had Orson Welles in a key role.  ""The Maltese Falcon,"" had Humphrey Bogart.

This movie has no shortage of stars--Paul Newman, a young Robert Wagner, Janet Leigh, Shelley Winters.  They even cast an aging Lauren Bacall--perhaps as a nod to the old Bogart-Bacall films.  But the movie still seems to fall a little flat.  Wagner is good, and Newman is good at times, but this performance isn't one of his best and the film is barely remembered for a reason.

Overall, the story is enough to keep you interested and there are several laughs, but you'll forget this one a month after you see it.",1174262400,3,1820,4.608695652173913

Harper is a loner, with an air of detachment and an ability to dispatch opponents with a fist and a flippant remark... He swings into action only mechanically...

Based on a Ross MacDonald detective novel, Newman plays Lew Harper (it was Archer in the book), a private eye, tough and scroungy, who gets involved in an incredibly complicated murder case involving seedy actresses, junkies, religious fanatics, and smugglers. The movie people decide to simplify things, I guess, by having Newman get beat up every now and then when the plot becomes too complicated to figure out. The tough talk by Newman seems forced, and because the story is so convoluted, character development is surfacey at best. Ten years later Newman would star in another MacDonald-based novel, THE DROWNING POOL, which isn't any better. Watch Humphrey Bogart in THE BIG SLEEP instead of this one: there are certain similarities, but Bogey is the man.",1134950400,,784,5.0852713178294575
296354,4,6300269418,"Based on Ross McDonald's The Moving Target--one in a long series of crime novels featuring southern California PI Lew Archer--1966's Harper is a perfect complement to Point Blank, released the next year, in which Lee Marvin is tough first, cool second. Paul Newman as Harper is cool first, tough second.  Neat trick.

While this is admittedly a little dated, it does bring back the 60s and in fact does a good job of it, too--even to the point of including a hippie pseudo-guru who's a front for smuggling in Mexicans from across the border, but who's got all the trademark paraphernalia--isolated wacky domicile, pet peregrine falcon with a fancy hood over its eyes, and, you know, flowing robes. Strother Martin does this role proud. It also has a ""groovy chick"" played by Pamela Tiffin who is, uh, a groovy chick--great bod, sexy face, and about as shallow as a frog pond in a drought.

All the middle aged women are great, really great: Julie Harris, Shelley Winters, Janet Leigh, and the great Lauren Bacall. Each one of the ladies is perfectly cast and does a terrific job, especially Shelly Winters as a liquored up former starlet who's now washed up and who sleeps it off, a lot.

Most of the cast is just plain fun to watch and it's also fun to see Newman as Harper put on various accents and personas to weasel and wheedle and wrangle information out of various folks. Harper gets beat up, but recovers fairly quickly (hey, he's the good guy; he has to), and this is OK because it's pretty easy to tell the film itself loves film noir but is subtly funning it at the same time it honors it. Sixties southern California noir--a great mix that Ross McDonald nailed in his novels and director Jack Smight follows pretty closely in the film.

It's about Harper trying to find the missing husband of wealthy wife Elaine Sampson (Bacall) and tracking the trail(s) that various people leave (or that Harper himself sniffs out) to do so. This is a standard noir/PI plot, but it's handled well here and, as noted, is really entertaining, mostly due to the terrific cast.

It would be nice if this was issued on DVD. Since there is no DVD of it, I managed to find a VCD (video compact disk) of it on another website. Worth owning, for sure.

The plot is OK, but quite predictable, At the time of it's release, some critics commented that Newman was ""the best Philip Marlowe that there never was."" Well, irrespective of how he may have emerged on the written page by author Ross MacDonald, Paul Newman's Lew Archer is a long way from Marlowe, and nowhere near as much fun. Still, if you can cope with the dated fashions, the predictability of the plot, and the bland performances of Arthur Hill, Robert Wagner and Pamela Tiffin, and the over-blown performance of Shelley Winters, there is still some enjoyment to be had from the film: especially if you are into convoluted private-eye thrillers.
