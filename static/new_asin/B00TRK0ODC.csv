7021356,4,B00TRK0ODC,Jennifer Aniston should have been nominated for an Academy Award!!!! Great story told in a simple straight forward way!,1427328000,6,119,5.315789473684211
7021357,4,B00TRK0ODC,"In just a matter of months, Cake - the latest starring role for Jennifer Aniston - went from being on every Oscars short-list to relatively forgotten by most moviegoers. There was much buzz surrounding Anistons performance, some even saying she would receive a Best Actress nomination, but that quickly dissipated when her name was no where to be found on the Academy Awards ballot. And heres the question most of you are wanting to know the answer to: was this deserved? Is it in fact not an Oscar-worthy film, or was it wrongly left out? Frankly, I don't really have a straight answer. However, what I can say is, the movie itself is not anything extraordinary. The only reason I feel it succeeds for the most part is because of Jennifer Anistons dedicated performance. Much like Wild, its a film that simply wouldnt work without its strong female lead.

It centers around a woman named Claire who is, more or less, contemplating suicide every day of her life. Shes dealing with a traumatic event that is unknown to the audience (until about half-way through) and has become addicted to Oxycontin and many other drugs. Shes constantly wallering in her own self-pity and the only person she has to care for her is a maid that is willing to fuel her drug addiction.

As you can probably tell, it isn't the most cheery movie. It mainly deals with themes of soul-searching and trying to get past something you cannot change. The main thing that struck me about it, and what sets it apart, is that its obviously a story directed at women. Theres been many films about similar subjects, but most of them are from a mans perspective. The fact that it isn't afraid to depict a flawed womans struggle with her own mortality is refreshing. But, that isn't to say the movie is without its flaws. It was a tad too sentimental for my taste and definitely could have been cut-down by about twenty minutes. But overall, its definitely one to check out if you're even mildly interested.",1426291200,111,1972,4.663793103448276
7021358,4,B00TRK0ODC,"This is one of those movies the hubster would call a 'Chick Flick' and stopped watching. Better for me though, than I can get lost in the deeply heartbreaking story.
Jen Aniston plays a role like I've never seen her play before. A woman who is addicted to pain meds after experiencing so much loss. I was gutted. Aniston played the part so well I felt her pain.
For the life of me, I can't believe there wasn't more hoopla around this film in theaters. And why did she not win an Oscar, 'cause she should've. This movie and her performance, were spot on! It was well-played and well-made!",1426032000,105,588,4.4036697247706424
7021359,3,B00TRK0ODC,"This was not an engaging movie.  Anna Kendrick was the best part of it, and she was dead!  Her presence was a ray of sunshine when she popped up here and there. Her sentiments were the opposite of sunshine, but you'll have to see it for more on that.  I did like Jennifer Aniston's portrayal of a woman saddled with chronic pain. The acting of her caregiver, her ex-husband, support group leader, and others were quality performances.  For the entirety of the movie, I was anticipating the details of what brought about her downfall.  There were minor inklings, yet they were few and far between.  The story dragged along to the point where I eventually didn't even care anymore about what had happened to her.",1426032000,6,710,4.64

The lead character, played by Aniston, is hostile and in chronic pain, addicted to prescription drugs and all scarred up.  The audience is pretty much left in the dark as to the cause of this woman's misery through most of the film.  There is little satisfaction once it's revealed.  What is never revealed, is how this woman, divorced, unemployed and living alone, has a full-time housekeeper, a nice car and an expensive home with a pool.",1425686400,21,506,4.704545454545454

7021362,4,B00TRK0ODC,"Claire Bennett (Jennifer Aniston) lives in chronic pain. She has scars and we can only guess as to what happened until about an hour into the film when we discover our guess is correct. The film has very little plot as it shows us Claire coping with pain. She is well off and has a house keeper (Adriana Barraza) who tolerates her illegal activities to obtain pain killers. She has alienated her husband and got kicked out of her support group. Nina (Anne Kendrick) was a member of the support group who has committed suicide, a concept Claire entertains. Claire sees and communicates with Anne Kendrick in her hallucinations and dreams, which were far from the dreams I have of Anne Kendrick.

The film takes a sympathetic view to people addicted to pain killers. I think most of us know of someone who for some reason or another love their pain killers dangerously too much. This film is considered a coming out party for Aniston who has been criticized for her frequent Razzie performances. To her credit Aniston played the role well and a giant step in the right direction. Clearly she played a woman who couldn't sit in a chair long enough to get her hair done. As far as the Oscar hype, I though Hilary Swank was far better as an ALS patient (You're not You) and she didn't even get a nod.

Certainly worth a view, particularly for fans of Oxicon.

7021363,4,B00TRK0ODC,"""Cake"" (2014 release; 102 min.) brings the story of Claire (played by Jennifer Aniston). As the movie opens, Claire is in a meeting of a chronic pain support group. We learn that someone in the group, Nicole (played by Anna Kendrick), just has committed suicide, After making sarcastic and rude comments about Nicole, Claire is kicked out of the support group. Meanwhile we get to see Claire's daily routine, which is basically popping pills to deal with the chronic back pain that is so debilitating she can't even sit up straight in the car. Plus we notice Claire has scars all over her body. What exactly happened to Claire? And what happened to Nicole? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Daniel Barnz, who previously gave us the school drama ""Won't Back Down"" (2012). Here, Barnz goes into a completely different direction, and brings us a decidedly less uplifting movie. In fact, I'd call the movie a heavy duty drama about dealing with chronic pain and suicide. Script writer Patrick Tobin carefully outlines the ""story"", although there isn't much of a true story line or plot. This is not a complaint. Instead we examine characters, and how they deal with the lot they've been given. The interaction on the one hand between Claire and her Mexican housekeeper Silvana (played by Adriana Barraza), and on the other hand between Claire and Roy, Nicole's surviving husband (played by Sam Worthington) carry the movie. Much has been said already about Aniston's performance, so let's get to it: yes, this is one of the best performances of Aniston's career, and it is a darn shame in my book that she did not get an Oscar nomination for this performance. This is MILES away from ""Friends"" or ""Horrible Bosses""... Also noteworthy is Adriana Barraza as the caring but spunky housekeeper/friend. Anna Kendrick shows up in a couple of scenes as the ghost of Nicole who won't let Claire alone. Keep an eye out for William H. Macy in a blink-it-and-you'll-miss-it appearance. Last but not least, there is a very nice instrumental score. composed by Christopher Beck.(And as a complete aside, Amazon could've made this DVD easier to find by mentioning Jennifer Aniston, you know, the movie's leading role and star...)

""Cake"" finally opened in theaters in late January and I couldn't wait to see this. The matin&eacute;e screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. That's hardly surprising, given the overall tone of the movie. This is not a movie you'll walk away from thinking ""this was a jolly good time!"". Instead, you will likely leave the theater still thinking about these characters. If you have a chance to check out ""Cake"", be it in the theater or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. I'd readily suggest you do so. ""Cake"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1424736000,245,2925,4.883299798792756

There was such incredible fodder to work with (loss, chronic pain, addiction, etc) and none of it was explored in depth. This is a very superficial movie about very deep things. Entertaining, but not the moving experience it could have been.",1505088000,,636,4.678571428571429

In CAKE, we see a husband grieving for a young wife, a mother and father grieving the death of a son, a housekeeper grieving for the family that was devastated by the loss. Aniston's character, Claire, suffers a loss compounded by chronic pain and addiction to pain medication. Tough subjects to bring to a movie and perhaps not everyone will be comfortable with the dark themes of this movie.  Nonetheless, Aniston is remarkable in her portrayal of Claire.  The real prize, however, goes to Adriana Barraza for her outstanding, quietly understated portrayal of the steadfast, loyal, loving housekeeper, Silvana.

7021382,1,B00TRK0ODC,"Review of Cake
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Please, give Jennifer Aniston an Oscar already. If only so she can stop making movies like this one. If you watch the preview, its pretty obvious she wanted a nomination. If you watch the movie, youll think to yourself, Oh man, she really looks like shes in pain! for about five minutes. Then, turn it off. Trust me.

Aniston plays a woman whos been in an accident and is in constant, terrible pain. But before you feel sorry for her and hand her that gold statue, know this: throughout the entire movie, she makes bad choice after bad choice, and shes not likable in the slightest. The story is simultaneously boring and frustrating. And where did the acting go? Anistons press agent spent a season touting her acting in preparation for the nomination she didn't receive, but the finished product doesnt show any of it.

If you want to see someone with back pain, rent The Answer Man. Its much more enjoyable. Cake is terrible. Frankly, it gives desserts a bad name.",1497225600,,1013,4.585635359116022

7021389,4,B00TRK0ODC,"""Cake"" is sometimes so painful to watch that viewers might be tempted to turn it off before the tide turns. This would be a shame, because it's a flawed, but beautiful, movie with a hopeful message and great acting by Aniston.  Four well-deserved stars for her performance as Claire, the survivor of a catastrophic car accident. She's in so much pain that she regularly has terrifying suicidal nightmares. She takes so much pain medication that she's hallucinating, and she's still in pain. While not trivializing the seriousness of her chronic physical pain, ""Cake"" illustrates how emotional and physical suffering go together.  We all live with pain of one sort or another, and if we can identify with Claire instead of rejecting her condition as too extreme or depressing, we might see ourselves through the metaphor of her excruciating condition and be inspired to open our hearts to our own suffering. Claire has suffered so much loss and pain that she's in a permanent, impotent rage. She starts to come out of her misery somewhat by chance, as she instinctively stumbles around in the dark, trying to figure out how to go on living. In the process, her essential kindness and love of life grow new roots. Then the title means something.

The fifth star is missing because of some contrived scenes and characters. For the sake of comedic relief, certain situations have the ring of farce rather than truth.  On the other hand, some of those scenes are funny in a ""gallows humor"" kind of way, and those laughs help lighten the mood.  Some reviewers here complain that ""Cake"" is too sad, but I watched it in a transfixed state without once thinking this is too much, I have to look away.  This is mainly because Aniston's performance was so powerful. She did not receive, but she certainly deserved, an Oscar nomination.

Rotten Tomatoes rated this film poorly (under 50%). I strongly disagree. Aniston has been typecast as a vapid celebrity, and the critics don't view her as a serious actor. One reviewer said Aniston wasn't up to the task of embodying the role.  We must have watched two different movies.  Aniston absolutely is a serious actor. It's been a while since this film was released. I hope she makes another film soon that's worthy of her considerable and largely untapped talents.",1494460800,,2299,4.844387755102041

The film builds slowly, and as the story unravels, the scope of the lead character's (Claire) pain, both physical and emotional, is revealed.  Any mother can imagine how hard it would be in such a situation.  If this film doesn't make you feel something, then you are completely numb inside.  I think that the ratings for this movie are far lower than they should be and don't reflect the true value of the film.

7021425,4,B00TRK0ODC,"A downer, depressing movie for a while, but the story is good enough and Jennifer Aniston as Claire Bennett is good enough to keep you watching. I wanted to find out why Claire has the facial scars she does and why she is in chronic pain. Why is she borderline suicidal and just what is the story behind her relationship with Nina Collins (Anna Kendrick), a 31-year-old married mother of a 5-year-old boy who has just committed suicide as the movie begins?

At one point Claire calls Nina, ""St. Nina"", to which Nina responds, ""Saints don't jump off bridges.""

Maybe they do, though. A woman once came to St. John Vianney, worried about the eternal destiny her husband's soul. He had jumped from a bridge to his death in a suicide. And the Cure d'Ars, St. John Vianney, who could read souls, responded to her, ""He repented before he hit the water.""

As St. Faustina (1905-1938) says, ""Let our judgment of souls cease, for God's mercy upon them is extraordinary. ... Oh, how beyond comprehension is God's mercy! ... God's mercy sometimes touches the sinner at the last moment in a wondrous and mysterious way.""

I was surprised by the good deal of religious imagery in ""Cake"". Though Claire is an atheist, the Virgin of Guadalupe, ""St. Jude, the saint-patron of lost and desperate causes"", and the Rosary come up during the movie.

Spoiler Alert*******************************************************************
In one of the movie ""Extras"", Director Daniel Barnz said ""Cake"" is about ""becoming unstuck in your life."" Producer Kristin Hahn says it is about ""pulling yourself up and healing."" Viewers find out at the end that Claire has lost a young son and been in a traumatic accident. She proceeds to destroy her marriage and live in substance abuse. I've read that many marriages, it might have even been a majority, break up after the death of a child.

""Cake"" might prove a cathartic experience for people who have lost a child, have chronic pain, or who suffer morbid guilt, regret, depression, or temptations to suicide or who have made suicide attempts. Maybe the movie might also be helpful to the families of suicides.",1471478400,4,2127,4.894444444444445

7021428,5,B00TRK0ODC,"Jennifer Aniston takes on a whole new genre with Cake and nails it.

Let me say this is not light hearted at all. This is excruciatingly sad. It is so hard especially if you have/had children. Jennifer Aniston can totally break your heart to pieces as you watch her struggle to survive life. She is amazing.  Sam Worthington is a great supportive actor and is also a heart breaker in this movie.

7021432,5,B00TRK0ODC,"This was an excellent movie which did not get the acclaim it deserved.  Jennifer Aniston gives a wonderful, believable performance as an angry chronic pain sufferer who will go to any lengths to get painkillers.  The supporting cast is very good, too.",1467504000,,251,4.9523809523809526
7021433,5,B00TRK0ODC,"This is by far the best movie about grief and trauma that I have ever seen. It's the absolute honesty of the pain that is shown. And that the one person in this life that you wanted to please and to be happy for, that you smiled for so easily, naturally for, is now gone.

So in a way, you don't really ever have to even pretend or put on a happy face ever again because nobody else's opinion really matters.

And you can just forget that happy easy feeling of familiarity, and understanding to ever show up again. The looking forward. There will be days and days of just sustaining.

This was a hard movie to watch but really very cathartic and openly human. I have never fit in at support groups and either get up and walk out, and just get the hell away. They work for some people but not me. And sometimes you're just going to stop saying all the nice pretty pleasing things and just stop talking altogether. Because there is actually solace in silence.

I don't think, that other people who haven't lost that special family member or person really know that the gaping open wound in the soul is real. That wound is eternally left open and will always hurt. No amount of make up, or pretend smiling will heal it. I totally get this movie.

Just looking up at the windchimes, is painful but they do soothe the soul. That life is here now demanding our attention, is shown very accurately.

Thank You to Jennifer Aniston for having the guts to play Claire, and to play her so beautifully. And to Patrick Tobin for writing it.

Even the physical therapy sessions are very accurate. Getting better hurts like hell. Those painkillers are a sea of neverland to float away to. I remember one day, I just said, no more of the hard stuff. I still have pain. Days of pain. Sleepless nights of pain, but mostly I rely on Ibuprofen in small doses.
You do what you can do.

Although thankfully, I didn't have anything close to Claire. I will say I started getting a whole lot better when I finally went to a physical therapist who recognized my pain and compassionately helped me achieve my goals. The whole tough love, drill sergeant, in your face stuff was awful for me; and that therapist made things way worse. So, you have to be wise about who you go to. Claire's caretaker Seldana was a true spirit of grace and light.

This movie is so sensitive, honest and real, that really does make you want to sit up more. Be alive more, even when it hurts. And that's a real blessing. Grazie!",1467504000,,2479,4.383442265795207

However,  Cake (2014) starting Jennifer Aniston as a mother grieving the death of her young son, is one of the best when it comes to the subject.

Her only friend is an opinionated and caring Mexican housekeeper and...

Aniston should have won an Oscar for that role.  Her best performance so far...together with that of crazy psychiatrist Jane Claremont from She's Funny That Way (2014).

This movie is for the intellectual, and I can see how many will jump to their own defenses and find offense with the language or honesty.  This movie is somewhat slow, but it is a true reflection of a difficult healing process. I like that it is up to the viewer to slowly piece together answers to the questions they may have.  I am not a fan of Aniston, but Jennifer did a wonderful job in this film, love that it was outside of her usual typecasting.  It is always a nice when I am pleasantly surprised by someone I usually get annoyed by.  With her most recent work, I slowly convinced that she is reaching the height of her career (if she would just ditch the fake ass makeup commercials).

Adriana Barraza amazingly played Silvana's sweet sweet role.  I just wanted to hug her and kept wishing she would be hugged in this movie.  They both should have won globe or oscar.  It was a late reaction, but the scene about a box of toys made sense to me later.  I was waiting and waiting for the title to make sense, and when it finally did, I was in tears.

Left me feeling as if I only watched half a movie. Actors all did a good job except Enough ""F"" bombs, geeez!",1453680000,,502,4.294736842105263

7021522,5,B00TRK0ODC,"It's so refreshing to see someone of Jennifer Aniston's caliber, star in a drama like this, especially with minimal, if any, makeup at all. Not just that, but to see her in such a serious role, I am just so very impressed with her. In fact, this movie, above all others I've seen her in, has truly turned me around and made me more respectful of her acting. I mean, she's got the smart-ass, pill popping junkie; the grief and pain avoiding victim, down to a 'T'. It's almost as if she's actually lived this woman's life and walked in her shoes.
I really enjoyed this movie, but I'm a little surprised that this hasn't had the recognition it truly deserves. Even more than that, I don't understand why there's hardly any mention of her acting, in this movie. Must be she's too strong of a personality and not very good at sucking and kissing the right body parts of certain people in the industry. Not that I'm cynical like the Claire character in Cake...just saying. I must add that, although I thoroughly get Claire and I really liked this flick, it's definitely not for everybody. I think most ladies fairly far along in their recovery would enjoy this, but maybe not so much in early recovery, In fact, for them, this movie may make them want to relapse.",1452816000,,1257,4.493449781659389

7021524,5,B00TRK0ODC,"This film is so close to my life story - it was quite unnerving, actually. And my best friend of 20yrs, who also had chronic pain, killed herself last year, leaving a son behind, left no note and comes to me every single night I my dreams. I also have several chronic health problems and am in Jennifer Aniston's age-range -- and the way she moved her body (ESP the head and torso sort of moving all as one piece at times), and the accidental grunts and groans and wincing with ever task - the nightmares and awakening from pain (emotionally AND phycisally) --- just was almost unnerving in how true to life -- true to MY life in fact!! -- the film was. The pushing away of people, even the clothes she wore (loose, drapey, comfy soft pieces for ppl stuck in either a hiding-out-from-the-world or home with health issues - I literally actually own several of the same tops Aniston wore in the film!!
Anyway, I don't mean to write a review about a movie and instead write my personal autobiography - but Jennifer Aniston has always been extremely under-rated as an actress (even on ""Friends"" - just a sitcom - I alw felt her comedic timing and naturalness stood apart and I've been personally kind-of ""rooting for her"" all these years (she being the underdog in many ways) -- and I just wanted to point out that as someone whose own life has even mirrored the actress' REAL life in some major ways, I was completely unprepared for the thousands of parallels this move captured that I literally live with every single day.  The regret, the almost-obsession w a friend's suicide and the murky reasons why, the stress on your body just from having constant pain - which of course only creates more stress and therefore more pain, and the isolation trauma, tragedies and just not feeling a lot part of the world -- even down to not being ready to let certain intensely painful thoughts and emotions and guilts and regrets go, for the many reasons that happens -- I just cannot express how on-the-nose this ful was for me, and Jennifer Aniston was amazing (and beautiful) in it.
Having lost the only person I knew who also suffered from and understood SEVERE and traumatic chronic pain (not the wimpy kind, the REAL kind) -- and the strangeness of losing that person to suicide over their pain while you're left behind now hurting double - my best friend was like Anna Kendrick here, coming to me every night for ages now. Aniston was brilliant and the filmmakers might never know they accidentally wrote my autobiography and that instead of agitating the (emotional and physical) pain as I anticipated - it was a Smtms hard watch Bc hitting so close to home but by the end it felt like a balm. Truly. Amazing, interesting, and hopefully inspiring. A lot of takeaway for me anyway...",1452384000,,2777,4.5875251509054324

7021598,3,B00TRK0ODC,"CAKE is dismal and dark story about chronic pain and suicide. This is a not a happy or inspiring film bit Jennifer Aniston is phenomenal as the bitter and angry Claire Bennett. This is a painstakingly slow moving film a woman who is broken spiritually, emotionally and physically. It's clear that Claire has been in some sort of accident and suffered a major loss but the facts are slow in coming and flashbacks are almost non-existent so the story is linear and often confusing. Why is Claire so mean to the world around her, especially to her kind and loving housekeeper Silvana?
Aniston is incredibly believable as she suffers through the painful motions of the day and relies on excessive use of painkillers to make it through the day. Was she ever happy? Was she once a nice, loving woman? We never quite know as her story unfolds and she obsesses over the suicide of a young lady (Anna Kendrick)  from her support group. She connects with the victim's widower (Sam Worthington), but where are we going with all this?

7021616,3,B00TRK0ODC,"Cake is a dark movie (it's not a dark comedy), Jennifer Aniston plays a pretty unlikeable main character who treats her maid with contempt, is rude to everyone else and seems initially to have a life objective of living in a prescription drug induced zombie like state lying in her bed or sitting up on her pool lounge. It is slowly revealed to we viewers the events that have led up to this mental state as well as her chronic pain, visible scars and other disfigurations, and why for example she puts the seat back down in the car and is driven everywhere looking at the roof. Also you have to wait until near the end to know why the film is called cake.

Anniston does a good job as being believable as being in chronic pain, shuffling at the right times, wincing at others. It certainly would take courage as an actress who lets be honest probably owes most of her career's roles to the fact she is good looking, to this time round play a role where she doesn't brush her hair and makeup is used to make her look unattractive rather than enhance her looks. Does that mean she should have won an Oscar for that? No but she does do a good job.

There isn't really a plot to this movie, other than being a fly on the wall to Claire's (Aniston's character) depressed life. Obviously she improves her outlook on some aspects of life as the movie goes on, and the slow one by one revelations of what happened for her to be at this stage of her life is what the movie is about.. There's a weird talking to a dead character subplot, who we the viewer even when the film is over know nothing really about, played by Anna Kendrick. All we know about her is she was a mother with a family who was in Claire's support group who made a decision to jump off a freeway overpass onto vehicles below her. I think we should have learnt a little bit more about her character in the movie as I still don't know why she was haunting Claire so to speak? What do the two have to do with one another? Were the two friends in some sort of way at the or prior to the support group? Why is her ghost immaculately dressed all the time and looking her best when you would assume she would have been in Claire's appearance state from when the two met. Why was Claire so obsessed with learning about her home life? I get why she's interested in her suicide and what motivated her or was there one factor that pushed her mind that way that differs from hers, as she has those thoughts of her own but why so interested in her home life?

We can say how realistic the character of Claire is to real life people who suffer from chronic pain and or depression, but the group counsellor played by Felicity Huffman was not believable at all. There is no way you kick out someone who obviously has suicidal thoughts from a support group just because she mocked the decision of Kendrick's character. Carers and people in Huffman's role would be dealing with a lot of angry outbursts and comments like this. She would have been trained in how to deal with it, for sure she would have asked to speak to her afterwards or before the next meeting and have a one on one talk about what was said and how it might upset others, but you wouldn't kick someone in her mental state out. Especially not in a cowardly answering machine message. Especially if Claire used to be a lawyer (it's not 100% clear in the movie if Claire was one) but even if she wasn't, and she kills herself after being dumped from the program, there would be an obvious lawsuit.

I also didn't think it was plausible that the maid wouldn't have known who William H Macy's character was. She was obviously around in Claire's prior life when Claire was a success and in a happy marriage to be so protective of her in the current times, such as saving the toys she knows Claire will want again in the years ahead, as well as putting up with her abuse and contempt in her present state. It's a little bit unethical as well that Macy's name is prominent on the DVD cover when he is in the film for about 30 seconds.",1440806400,,4039,4.282722513089006

Dark and yet full of curiosity, this is a woman being pulled apart.  There is no sugar coating, but at times a glimpse of sweetness.  It is heavy, I live with chronic pain and did see a lot of mirroring. Some things are impossible to contain and pain writes on our face, yells from our mouth, and twists reality.  Pain is our own, what others can't see makes it tough for them to acknowledge. It's impossible to explain.

I will finish this movie and I will follow up here, but meanwhile please let me ask of those who do choose to watch, there should be no belittling of another's pain. Acknowledgement is freedom and compassion is the key, everyone experiences pain - but not all will find a relief from it.",1439769600,,867,4.427672955974843

7021639,2,B00TRK0ODC,"I know the critics were raving and the trailers were positive but to be completely honest I spent the entire movie wondering ""What's the point.""
After a short discussion with my viewing buddy we summed it up: It could've been 1,0000 times better if only they'd added some back story.
We gathered that there was probably a car accident and she now suffers from chronic back pain and a pill addiction. William H Macy was in it for like a minute-he must've been the other driver.
She's being haunted by Anna Kendrick's ghost-who's very annoying. Don't know why.
She's a cursing, whiny, b.
She's got a Mexican housekeeper who she mistreats.
She's taken a liking to Anna Kendrick's husband & kid.
We know her son died.

As for this being a defining role for Jennifer Aniston....
I beg to differ. Now when I see a Jennifer Aniston film and I don't believe I'm watching Jennifer Aniston, that will be career defining/altering.
Keeping in mind that I am neither a fan nor a hater (I liked her in He's just not that into you, Marley & Me, and Bruce Almighty)

I find that to be true.  It made me feel compassion towards Anistons' character.  Her mental / emotional trauma transformed into chronic pain, making her life miserable.  Wonderfully acted, brilliantly written and something for anyone to walk away with.  Thank you for such a deeply moving movie.

7021673,3,B00TRK0ODC,"If Jennifer Aniston had gotten an Oscar nod for her performance in this drama from 2014, I wouldn't have complained.  I mean, what's a girl gotta do, right?  Perhaps adding ""Monster"" to the title would have done the trick.  It worked for Halle Berry and Charlize Theron.  My snarky comments are consistent with Aniston's character, Claire.  She's a lawyer by profession but hasn't work in some time due to severe pain brought on by a terrible event, which isn't disclosed until well into the film.

In any case she's scarred and has difficulty moving and sleeping.  She's in therapy both physical and psychological, but she generally copes with strong pain meds.  Even resorting to travelling to Tijuana to get more.  Her estranged husband (Chris Messina) has moved out, so she relies heavily on her maid, Silvana (Adriana Barraza) to transport her, cook and clean for her and risk ICE with trips to Mexico.

Claire is fascinated by the suicide of one of the women in her support group.  Nina (Anna Kendrick) visits Claire on occasion in her dreams and in hallucinations.  Claire goes to where Nina jumped from an overpass and even goes to Nina's house where her husband (Sam Worthington) and young son (Evan O'Toole) are trying to pick up the pieces.  Surprisingly Claire and Roy (Worthington) form a sort of bond, each recognizing that one isn't going to fix the pain of the other.

Claire's glammed down look may be expected but her acerbic humor gets on everyone's nerves.  It becomes evident that her pain goes deeper than the physical discomfort she suffers.  Only Silvana puts up with her and is probably the only friend she really has.  I wish I could have liked this movie more, but it felt like its only purpose was to promote Jennifer's dramatic chops.  And certainly, this isn't the woman you've seen in ""Horrible Bosses"" or ""We're the Millers.""  See it for Aniston and Barraza who is brilliant as well.

The Blu ray disc comes with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio with 1080p video resolution.  The presentation is excellent with strong colors.  I did notice a very slight yellowish tint to some of the scenes which seemed a little unnatural.  Not a big deal.  The detail and clarity are excellent.  This is most evident in some of the close-ups of Claire's face, showing the scarring and the superior make-up that makes it all work.  I could see no transfer abnormalities.  Sound comes from a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it works well.  While the audio is relatively sedate through much of the movie, there are a few scenes when the surrounds and LFE channel come to life.  Usual during dream sequences and when she has her pool therapy sessions.  Otherwise the dialog is easily understood and properly focused.  Subtitles are available in English SD, Spanish and French.  Extras include a 3 and a half minute piece called ""The Many Layers of Cake"" featuring a stunt woman who had a similar experience as Claire.  There's a similarly short piece with some cast and crew interviews and finally, the theatrical trailer.",1437436800,,3026,4.79110251450677

7021677,3,B00TRK0ODC,"My girlfriend asked me to watch this with her so I gave it a try.  I had not the slightest idea or clue as to what this movie entailed other than knowing Jennifer Aniston played the lead.  The opening of this movie introduced the audience to a depressed and fallen woman that experienced a traumatic event taking the audience on a journey through her lens and perception of everyday encounters in life.  I am never impressed with actors/actresses taking the role of someone depressed, suicidal, addicted, or mentally retarded.  Why?  It's an easy one-way ticket to elicit those emotions especially mimicking someone addicted to pills.  I could play a pill popping addict if you handed me a script.

Aniston essentially gave up on life bordering on suicidal thoughts and acting out on those thoughts attempting to drown herself in a pool.  Nevertheless she fought through her depression, stopped taking pain pills, and realized the preciousness of life after spending some awkward moments with Sam Worthington explaining to her how he had no sympathy for his dead wife.  Aniston had an intrigue with Worthington's dead wife whom committed suicide for whatever reasons and left a broken and grieving family with no answers nor mother.

The story was extremely slow paced and had some random moments of awkward scenes such as the hispanic contractor sleeping with her to fill a sexual void.  Moreover the scene of her showing up at ""her old house"" and convincing the homeowner to allow her in to reflect on her childhood, and lastly the scene whereupon she picks up a random young traveler heading to Los Angeles in pursuit of becoming a model.  Beyond the awkward scenes, the director attempted to challenge and force the audience to put the pieces together themselves to empathize for Aniston.

This movie without a doubt was written particularly for women and men that have endured a traumatic experience quite similar to the experience Aniston faced.  I can see this film being played in support group circles everywhere.  Unfortunately this movie didn't deliver with the common movie-goer due to the psychological content that left the audience feeling depressed, boredom, tiredness with a tinge of empathy.",1437264000,,2209,5.046831955922865

Just the fact that Aniston was able to accurately portray some parts of what life is like when you suffer with horrible pain 24 hours a day/everyday means that she researched her role. Most people go through life never knowing what it really means to say ""this pain is killing me"" and to be actually telling the truth. That is a good thing, I wish no one ever felt the pain I feel; however I know from experience that people do in fact feel pain so terrible that it is literally killing them.
Some reviews say Claire is a drug addict, I do not know why they say that. Is it because she went to Mexico to buy pain medicine? You see I know, even with documented proof of an intractable pain condition/disease, how hard it is to get a doctor to prescribe pain medicine at all. I am a professional, clean cut, well dressed, well spoken, educated, man who has never been arrested or anything like that. Still many/most doctors will not help me at all. It is not all their fault, the war on drugs has become a war on people that need pain medicine; which is now turning into a resurgence of heroin use in the US. So If I had the money and was close to the border I think I would have done the same thing. I do not condone self medicating, but when the medical and legal community force your hand, you do what you need to do in order to get some relief.
Anyway Aniston did a wonderful job becoming this character down to the difficulty moving. I was crying early on when they showed Claire in bed.
On top of that, add the tremendous emotional pain of losing her family, especially her son, at the same time she was physically injured. Thank God I do not know Claire's pain in that since. I can empathize with the character though, which makes the acting and the film in general even that more meaningful.
I liked Aniston before, but to see her do such a great job in this film makes me love her. I now see that she is even more talented than I previously thought.

There is no real resolution, such is life. I understand that there needed to be some action at the end that showed that Claire was now on the right track, so she sat up quickly in her car. I really think that lessened the movie, at least for me. However like I said I understand the need for something to be done, so it may as well be that, since laying down in the car was seen throughout the movie.

I do not think many people can even begin to understand this movie, it is not really meant for a huge audience. I am however so glad that it was made.",1436918400,,2667,4.196881091617934

7021711,5,B00TRK0ODC,"While I can see from some reviews posted here an acknowledgment that living with chronic pain is a downer, unless it fills every second of the rest of your life, you cannot possibly understand that from the first moment of looking into Jennifer Anniston's face, she is living in that nightmare from which it is impossible to awaken.  The way she moves and moans is spot on.  As a sufferer of chronic pain, and with issues that cannot be resolved with physical therapy (swimming or otherwise), I was so grateful that Jennifer was willing to lose the cute girl persona and become the embodiment of this issue that is ignored by society.  We are essentially shunned, and since we are unable to participate, we hide.  There are two things I want to address, however:
1. Taking prescription medication for pain is NOT addiction.  Addiction is when pills mess up your life, and you make decisions that hurt yourself and others in the pursuit of drugs.  Pain medication allows you to have a modicum of a life, which otherwise would be NOT worth living.  Think unceasing agony.  The government and medical industry makes it very difficult to get the pain medication needed just to function.  Which, BTW, the scenes where Claire popped a fair number of pills is sometimes the case when the pain gets away from you.  The amount of bureaucratic aggravation and time away from home is often the cause - the doctors can either be great or horrible.  But it was accurately portrayed when Claire needed help, they gave her some ridiculous joke of a quantity that doesn't get the job done.  I cheered her in taking matters into her own hands. While I am lucky enough to work from home, thus hiding my condition from co-workers, I could do NONE of it without pain meds.  I am not taking the medicine to get high.  I am taking it so I can continue one more day.
2. I was disappointed that it was portrayed that Claire could just will her way to a med-free life.  She didn't seem to hurt any more than when she was on the pain meds.  This was the only part that made me a bit angry, since it is illogical.  The source of the pain doesn't disappear in most cases.  Unfortunately, this feeds into the ""addiction"" thing, since it was made to appear to be a choice.
Know that those of us with chronic pain, that is unrelenting torture, have no choice.  Pain medication is mandatory.
I appreciate the opportunity to see ANY movie that deals with pain, but especially the way Jennifer Anniston portrayed it.  Thank YOU, Jen!",1436486400,,2499,4.560538116591928

Sure, everyone raves about what a great job Anniston does playing the part, but it's all relative to her other work.  She is a D average actress doing a C+ performance.

Even with all of that piled on, I never felt an ounce of empathy for any of the characters.  The characters were just too flat for me to relate.  Most disney movies evoke stronger emotions.

Aniston is pretty good playing angry b! tch in pain, but she's completely--and I do mean completely--unbelievable as a civil-liberties lawyer and as a grieving mother. Nobility doesn't suit her at all.

The guy who plays the suicide's wimpy husband is awful, and so is the woman who plays the Mexican servant. Even Huffman and Macy are bad.

That means it's the writer's and director's faults. Might have been worth watching if those two had been competent, but they seem to have been working toward an Oscar for Aniston and let everything else slide into the sewer. Either that or they just don't have what it takes to make a good movie. This one is really stupid.",1436054400,3,824,4.6689655172413795

Frankly to me this whole movie was one big bore! I fell asleep three times, backed it up and fell asleep again and ditto once more;why I bothered I don't know. I think I had a dream that was more exciting and informative than this movie.

Jennifer Anniston seemed to be sleepwalking throughout Cake-if she had eaten some chocolate cake that would have been more exciting. In this movie Jen's displayed a  a personality similar to a dead fish.

Now I like Jennifer but have never thought she was a great actress and were I of the opinion that she WAS a great actress this movie would have turned my mind around.

To hell with all the particulars; read some of the long and boring reviews here and elsewhere and then make up your own mind.

Normally I take the chance and buy a movie just 'because' it sounds or looks good but thank the good marbles rolling about in my mind that this movie I rented.....oh how glad I am for I would have been livid spending big bucks on the most boring movie I have ever seen.....and believe me I've seen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

Enter ""Cake."" A pensive, quietly paced film about a woman living with chronic pain 24/7. Pain, mind you, that has turned her into a not so nice person. She is dependent on pain killers, the kindness of others (which she knows she doesn't always deserve) and becomes obsessed with the details of a young woman's suicide she learns of in a support group that she gets kicked out of because of her unpopular opinion regarding the woman's self-destructive act. You would think this would be a maudlin tear jerker, but like Aniston's earlier work in ""The Good Girl"", it is anything but. The humor is dry and effective.

This movie would have been seriously heavy and good if a real actress had been cast in the lead role. Like Meryl Streep, Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, Sandra Bullock, Julianne Moore, Jessica Chastain, Uma Thurman, Vera Farmiga, etc. Don't waste your time and money on yet another one of Aniston's pet production projects that she does to try and show she ""can really act"", she even ditched the makeup and went ugly trying to go the Charlize Theron"" Monster"" route, which didn't work, because she has no range or depth. She just has too much money & time on her hands, not to mention unwarranted fame. She has never carried a hit movie by herself, for good reason. She is never cast in anything serious or dramatic that isn't owned by her own production company, for good reason. She has never been recognized by her peers and nominated for an Academy Award, for good reason.

Also details how those sufferring will grasp at anything for help/change, or a glimmer of their old life; basicaly seeking hope or joy in any form.

I get why Jen probably wanted this role...dramatically it's a stretch, but the script....ouch.  This was a movie that was written so poorly, that by the time the backstory was revealed, I just didn't care.  Did Jennifer deserve an Oscar nod for this performance?

Jennifer Aniston is a study in anger, sadness, and loneliness- and in a place where drugs barely mask the hardship of going through life damaged.

This is not a happy film, nor is it a ""dark comedy"" as I've seen others describe it.  It's a marvelous character study of a woman struggling to maintain her grip on reality.  The writing is superb, and while the pacing occasionally drags, it's almost to be expected in this type of film.

Of note are the outstanding supporting actors whose characters are allowed to breathe and develop as they confront, challenge and ultimately save Aniston's Claire.  The only misstep being William H. Macy's extended cameo which basically comes out of left field and whose confrontation with Claire could have been handled with more subtlety.

This movie is dark, heavy, sad and a bit depressing touching on the subjects of loss, drug abuse, relationship fallout and suicide all in one story.  I was surprised as Aniston really played the role well as the depressed pain killer addicted woman dealing with the pain of a tragedy and the fallout from it.  She made have played it a bit too well at times as she really is unlikable especially in the beginning until the backstory is filled in via some symbolic scenes, talks in dreams with her friend and some flashbacks.  The movie is a bit slow and takes some patience to watch as there are times that some scenes are draw out a bit too much.  The ending to me is also a bit anticlimactic.

Clare has given up on life.  We don't know why, and the film subtly and slowly reveals the reason.  The interplay between depressed, sardonic ""Clare"" and ""Silvana"", is so well done. Adriana Barraza is superb as the compassionate, sensitive Hispanic housekeeper, the only person Clare has yet to alienate.  And Jennifer plays the lead painfully well.  A theme of despair and alienation and a return to life.  A choice to rejoin the living.  Wonderful film.  And there are moments of laughter too.  You will cry and laugh.

7021858,5,B00TRK0ODC,"""Cake"" starring Jennifer Aniston is an extraordinary and powerful film. The beginning is a little slow but I thought the plot was so interesting. Aniston plays Claire, a former lawyer who suffered a tragic car accident. After the accident, she developed severe chronic pain. There's more to the story/accident then meets the eye (which is reveled later in the film). Claire has grown to be a bitter, short-tempered, and deeply unhappy woman. We learn she has pushed everyone away from her life, including her supportive husband. Claire starts to hallucinate after the suicide of her support group ""friend"", Nina played by Anna Kendrick. I won't give too much away but I will say that Jennifer Aniston gives a fearless performance as Claire. Wow. Aniston hasn't been this good since 2002's dark comedy, ""The Good Girl"". She NEEDS to do more films like this - not those silly, forgettable comedies she's been churning out the last decade or so. I've always thought Aniston was a great actress but rightfully deserved better material. Well ""Cake"" is that film to prove she's more than just a pretty face and she isn't so pretty in this film - inside or out. Amazing film. Bravo to Aniston for going out of her comfort zone. And by the way, Aniston was totally robbed of a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars this year. Boo! I hope you enjoy this film! It's so haunting.",1434067200,,1368,4.776371308016878

What do you do when you have to live in physical and emotional pain everyday of your life?  I guess she can eventually find some way of living with what happened to her son, but her physical pain is here to stay. I don't see how physical therapy can help this.

7021904,4,B00TRK0ODC,"Jennifer Aniston does an astoundingly good job at portraying a woman in as much emotional pain as physical pain.  Though a film with a very dark and heavy plot and theme, it has its lighter moments and its glimmers of hope.  I think just about anyone would find something to relate to within this film, though I imagine chronic pain sufferers, depression sufferers, and those grieving lost loved ones may get the most out of it.  I gave it four stars for the concept and for the acting.  There are some slow moments and some unnecessary moments, especially some of those with the ""ghost"" of the woman who committed suicide.  Don't get me wrong; I know this was part of the lead's psyche ""talking"" to her, but I think the movie could have been just as powerful without those scenes, or with a different way or depicting those thoughts.  Regardless, 'Cake' is worthy of the four stars I gave it.  I want to say again: Jennifer Aniston is wonderful in this film!",1433635200,,959,4.540697674418604
7021905,5,B00TRK0ODC,"I suspect ""Cake"" hits home for many of the estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of American adults who suffer from chronic pain. It did for me. Is it a true 5-star movie? Probably not. But I felt compelled to give it the highest rating for the director's constraint in allowing the story to unfold, the dream/hallucination scenes, and Aniston's credible performance. Her portrayal of Claire's physical struggle to walk, get up from a chair, ride in a car, sleep, or even bake a cake were spot on. I can see how some viewers might not give the movie more than one or two stars, but they might want to try to see ""Cake"" for what it really is...a story about a person who has been betrayed by her body, trapped by her emotions, and is literally and figuratively struggling with every step she takes.",1433548800,,780,4.461538461538462

7021913,5,B00TRK0ODC,"For millions of people there is a line through their lives of an incident that changes e erything. In the case of Claire Bennett (Aniston) it is both physical full body trauma and posttraumatic stress dissorder. Many films have been made depicting this tragedy. Sophie's Choice, The Accused, Before And After, The Brave One, Taxi Driver, terms of Endearment, Born on the 4th of July. Yet there is something very special about ""Cake."" It is subtle and honest. It does not utilize shock value, sympathy, horror or even manipulate sadness. Everything about ""Cake"" is purely honest. And so, stripped of the Hollywood hype, ""Cake"" is a powerful and remarkable film.
  The script is brilliant and to the point. But it is Jennifer Aniston that puts this film in a class with those listed above. Her performance is so reall-so HONEST- that we forget she's acting. So much of the power of this film comes from her bare, un-made up eyes, still as blue as a June sky, but lit and filmed to show sorrow. In fact, the color blue is subtly used throughout. Anniston has taken her place among the great actors of all time with this film. Streep. Foster. Roberts. Hepburn. Kidman. Goldberg. Not at any time does one think of ""rachel"" and more than once we think, ""Where have they been hiding her?""
  If you have suffered a life changing tragedy: loss of leg, GBS, PTSD, head injury, death of child, paralysis-anything that leaves a chasm of before and after in your life-do not shy away from it. Many films and books are triggers, but this one is not. It has to be the honesty and the lack of blame.

Jennifer Aniston's character had the added pain of losing her son in the accident that left her in pain. Her performance was so real. I could feel her pain and when she sat up I cheered. You can ask my Westie. My cheer woke him up and he was not pleased.

Chronic pain never goes away but it can be managed. Not only by drugs but by people who support you who know what you're going through and who love you. People who know that your pain is real. You aren't a slacker or a wuss.

Jennifer Aniston was robbed. Either it was political which I know plays a part in who gets which Oscar if any or the actors who voted didn't understand chronic pain. Or both. Either one is unacceptable. I'm outraged as a movie goer and insulted as a person who lives with chronic pain.

That said the movie is worth watching. If you have no understanding of chronic pain, I urge you to read about it or ask someone you know who has chronic pain.",1432857600,,1064,4.180487804878049

It's just butchered and hacked up . I think I can make a better movie than that oh yes, it has no ending, it just stops which shouldn't surprise me but it kind of did.

7021988,5,B00TRK0ODC,"For this reviewer the first response after watching this mesmerizingly fascinating film was `how could Jennifer Aniston not have been nominated at least and won at best the Oscar for best performance by an actress for her impossibly difficult role in this film?', a film that not only is brilliantly written (Patrick Tobin) and directed (Daniel Barnz) but has perhaps the strongest supporting cast from any of last year's movies. Then the impact of the film seeps in and remains in the mind for hours and hours.

Briefly, and without any spoilers, the story opens in a chronic pain support group led by Annette (Felicity Huffman) and focused on the group's asking questions of the photograph depiction of the most recent suicide victim Nina (Anna Kendrick). Among those present is the acerbic, hilarious, scarred and barely mobile from pain Claire (Jennifer Aniston). Claire leaves the group in a negative fashion but is constantly visited by the ghost of the departed Nina. Claire is addicted to prescription analgesics and is tended by her loyal housekeeper Silvana (Adriana Barraza, who should have been nominated for best supporting actress). WE gradually learn some facts about Claire - she has deep facial scars and can barely walk, needing physical therapy by Bonnie (Mamie Gummer) and trips to her nurse (Lucy Punch) and to Tijuana for major supplies of Oxycontin and Percocet.  As she uncovers the details of Nina's suicide and develops a poignant relationship with Nina's husband (Sam Worthington), she also grapples with her own, very raw personal tragedy - she is separated from her husband (Chris Messina), has nightmares, and gradually the etiology of her scars and mental pain is suggested - but never blatantly revealed, not even with the appearance of the mysterious Leonard (William H. Macy).

And that is what makes the film so unique: who ever truly understands psychic and physical pain and how to recover completely? Throughout the film Aniston's concentrated performance convinces us of all the dynamics of that situation - and it simply works. The true history behind Claire's pain we discover not through our ears or eyes in this film, but through our hearts. This is an exceptionally fine film - if you are willing to mentally and emotionally participate in the story. Grady Harp, May 15",1432771200,,2313,5.065616797900263
7021989,1,B00TRK0ODC,I was terribly disappointed in this movie. I thought it was about people who do not have any desire to get better & are perfectly content to stay in their pool of self pity.,1432771200,2,173,4.117647058823529

Jennifer Aniston is almost tough to watch, she's so unattractive, with her scars and grungy hair and almost palpable pain.  Her character's intelligence is her only saving grace, though it is clearly not helping her current situation.  Isolated by her grief and her intellect, refusing to be placated by concepts of religion and forgiveness and thoughts of a heaven that she doesn't believe in, Aniston's character is stuck.  She can't decide if she wants to die, but she's clearly entertaining the idea.
I liked that this movie had sincere, kind-hearted characters, and I liked that Aniston wasn't one of them.  She did a good job in this movie, showing some serious acting credibility.

The main character herself (portrayed by Jennifer Aniston) even looks real; no done up hair and makeup and flawless outfits like we are so used to seeing in movies. Jennifer Aniston is at her best, showing us a different side than most of her rom coms. One of the reviews complained about her character being unlikeable- well that's the whole point! You see in the film how others are affected by her way of being, and there is a reason why she is the way she is. It is a nice change of pace from your typical box office movie.

  I was taken back by her performance in Cake.  She became the person she was portraying and was excellent.  It was impossible not to feel empathy for her.  She made me feel how much pain she was in and her anger her feeling of complete hopelessness  most of the time and how it was a struggle for her to face her pain and improve as her life had been shattered to pieces by one dramatic moment.  I loved her ward robe and how in her simplicity she so beautifully portrayed Clair.  I woman that people have something in common with more often than not.

It also didn't make any sense and leaves out a lot of detail so you'll be left wondering how or why certain events happened or what the point was. It was extremely unspecific. If the point was to spread awareness about those suffering with chronic pain, then it was a good try but highly unrealistic. At the end, Claire (Jennifer Aniston) just stops taking her pills-which it seems help her mental and physical pain. However, in reality, one with chronic physical pain isn't going to just be able to function all the sudden without pain management, in this case the pills. Also, anyone who is that depressed and takes pain pills so regularly is probably taking them for mental pain as well. Taking as many pills as she did in this movie causes an addiction, or she was addicted, so in reality nobody would be able to just stop taking them.

I could almost feel all the physical and emotional pain her character Claire felt from her chronic pain.  I myself have used  humor and and inappropriate remarks to deflect feelings and physical maladies away from me. I certainly did not go as far as this character but I can sure understand why she did. Without giving anything away I was surprised and sympathetic after I saw and heard what Miss Aniston's character went through in her life. Her performance was brilliant and heartfelt. Claire is one of those people you cannot help but love even if she is a shrew.  I am also am giving kudos to the woman who played her maid and caretaker Adriana Barraza. Her character Silvana was tolerant, kind, and full of nothing but heart for her employer who suffering from chronic pain made her job almost intolerable. She did loose control in one scene and ranted in Spanish. I was feeling this woman's plight. I also thought that even though Felicity Huffman's part was small as the therapist she was great. That woman can play all kinds of parts and do a wonderful job. I hardly recognized her just like when she played in the movie ""Transamerica."" I have to admit the relationship between the Claire and Silvana stole the show.

Claire is a foul mouthed, curmudgeonly drug addict, in chronic pain (physical or emotional? Never sure), popping painkillers like chiclets. She lost a child and was injured in an accident, and in the subsequent year managed to drive away everyone who cares about her but her housekeeper, Silvana. She alienates everyone in her chronic pain support group, to the point that they throw her out, due to her obsession with another group member who committed suicide. Claire goes so far as to talk her way into this woman's house and flirts with her husband. The whole first 2/3 of the film, she is dark, depressive and drug addled. Then suddenly, for no apparent reason, everything turns around. Even though she had been taking tons of painkillers for a year, suddenly, she's managing with none.

I cannot take narcotics which is both a blessing/curse, but if I could I would probably be addicted to them and I am terrified of the future because if i have to have any further surgeries/ilness their are no pain meds they can give me even in the hospital. I struggle daily to try to keep optimistic, even though I am alone (my daughters and husband are not there for me) they like most people are unable to understand the emotional and physical nightmare that is chronic-pain, an enduring nightmare with no end and always looking for that light at the end of the dark and lonely tunnel. It's a day to day struggle for survival-to find the will to keep fighting. THANK YOU Jennifer Aniston for your brilliant performance (It looked so painful every time your character moved-I feel physically how your character moved and looked, it was difficult for me to watch). You deserved an Oscar. THANK YOU for giving a voice to chronic-pain patients like me. Maybe it will help some people to understand and hopefully create chronic-pain support groups, because I couldn't find any in my town and I live in a very large city.",1430956800,,1247,4.621621621621622

7022140,3,B00TRK0ODC,Jennifer Anniston had a great performance in the movie but I don't understand why it was called a dark comedy as it was definitely more of a drama.

7022141,3,B00TRK0ODC,"This was Jennifer Aniston's best performance to date. She abandoned many of her usual affectations and was raw and real. I liked it. The movie itself had some clever plot moments. However, overall I found it somewhat flat and one-note - not unlike a dish that is under seasoned. It is billed as ""hilarious"". Be assured - there is nothing hilarious about this movie; it is quite tragic in many ways. The most dynamic relationship was between  Claire Bennett (Aniston) and Silvana (Barazza), underscored by great performances by both. The film is definitely watchable, just not particularly memorable.",1430956800,,599,5.112244897959184

The patient who out of desperation turn to the black market or trips to Mexico.  Good American citizens who never thought they would be in such a desperate situation.

7022187,3,B00TRK0ODC,"Be advised that if you're looking for a ""feel good"" movie, this is NOT it.

The acting is good though. Jennifer Aniston certainly as far out of the ""Friends"" zone as she is likely to get, and she's surprisingly good at it, but the characters are pretty one dimensional and she doesn't get a lot of opportunity to actually show us how really well she could play someone other than a comedic heroine type. But one can see the potential is there.

Bit of a cliche to have used both Felicity Huffman ~and~ William H. Macy, as when he made his appearance, rather than the attention being on his character, one is reminded that another character is played by his real-life wife, and I felt it detracted from his scene.

Many good actors, they portrayed their characters well, such as they were, but the story just wasn't there and so not much for them to sink their teeth into.",1430438400,,871,4.465408805031447
7022188,5,B00TRK0ODC,"This was an outstanding movie about a woman dealing with the worst kind of loss, and with physical and emotional scars, ultimately trying to decide whether or not to give up or keep going. (I won't tell you which she chooses.) It's beautifully acted - Jennifer Aniston was robbed of an Oscar (and a nomination! shameful!) - and I'm sure I will watch it again a few times for her performance alone. She transforms into a character we have never seen her play before, and she was phenomenal. I've never been a  huge Jennifer Aniston fan - haven't disliked her, but never got excited about all the rom coms she's done - but this was by far the best performance of her career and I hope she chooses more roles in this dramatic vein. She has a much wider range than I thought she did. The supporting cast was excellent as well, notably Anna Kendrick. The interplay between the two women was really intense and fascinating even though it was a hallucination. The movie as a whole was very intense but not at all unreal; having lived with someone who had chronic pain and became addicted to painkillers, there was so much sadness but still glimmers of humor as a sometimes-more-effective-than-others kind of coping mechanism. This is a touching and realistic movie about something that doesn't make it into many movies. If you want to see a powerful performance and an interesting (albeit very heavy) story, this is the movie for you.",1430438400,2,1427,4.662698412698413
7022189,5,B00TRK0ODC,"Most riveting movie I've seen in ages.  Jennifer Aniston dominates the screen, and, unless you have plastic in your veins, you cannot look away.  Her bitchiness is never mean spirited, connecting you to her pain.  I'd tried to watch this film while I was doing something else,....well the something else ended up waiting.  If this doesn't solidify her as one of the character actresses of our day, I don't know what will.  I live in Salt Lake, and hate that I missed the Sundance viewing.

It is hard to believe she wasn't nominated.  Maybe her celebrity works against her.  What a shame.  I rarely am moved by Hollywood anymore.  But this film is exquisite.  It's not Independence Day 36  or Avengers 37 or Whatever 38.  It is what film-making should be.  Tales of the human experience.  Impressed.

7022194,4,B00TRK0ODC,"Being a long term chronic pain patient myself,  I definitely related to her character minus the drinking.  It is well over 13 years since I had a glass of wine and just a few sips was too much for me.

Jennifer Aniston did a superior portrayal of the character.  In her character she presented the severe anger which I believe in turn is really deppression. Putting pill bottles in a variety of locations is certainly something I can understand as there can be a fear of not having enough medication until you obtain your next prescription refill.  Chronic pain is something that many people do not understand unless they are unfortunate to become a patient due to a variety of causes.

I would assume Jennifer Aniston believed in the project so much she put some of her own money up in order to get the project made.

My own feelings is to see it if your a chronic pain patient or not.",1430438400,,886,4.432098765432099

I just really hopes there would be more of a heart felt story than there even was. To all the critics the say they were tired of the whining the whole movie.

7022229,3,B00TRK0ODC,"Only in Hollywood would a story about a person living with pain include a rich, white woman, her Mexican ""maid"" and a romance with the hot guy from Clash of the Titans.  It also includes the occassional ""cameos"" from the suicide victim taunting the main character (which were very entertaining... ""Hello bitch"" lol) Some reviewers were put off by the ""heaviness"" of the story.  I don't think they could have served the subject matter on a more pallatable silver platter for us, much like the percocets she pops for the pain.  I live with a degree of pain that doesn't require regular management, but it could go that way later on.  It's not pretty.  I think Aniston's character does a good job conveying the type of self loathing that comes about from a broken body and broken spirit.  It was refreshing to see her in this role.  With a story focused on characters and experience, character development was sort of lacking and I would have like to see more story development.  It ended with me feeling like I saw 1/2 a movie, and I wanted more.  For that reason, I really liked it and I left it feeling like I saw something special.  Being the only movie of it's kind that I've ever seen, it didn't reach the depths it could have.  Solid 3.5 stars. 3 stars go to Aniston's character.",1430179200,3,1283,4.510822510822511

i had decided long ago that Jennifer Aniston sucks as an actress. When she does "" act"" she is Jennifer Aniston acting like she wants to be an actress, BUT she over-acts so abysmally she can't even pull that off. As someone who lives chronic pain day in and day out, I found her portrayal insultingly over asserted. Even in the beginning, 35 years ago when the shock of the hurt was most acute and I was least able to cope with it, was not as groany as she portrayed it. genuine chronic pain suffers do hot groan so much because they learn fast that nobody gives a damn how much they're suffering so they eat their pain to hide it from others because they done't want to hear a word of their pithy advice EVER.

7022258,5,B00TRK0ODC,"Cake was far from a feel good movie but it does give the viewer hope that life, even under the most tragic of situations is still worth fighting for. The ensemble cast was perfect .

Yes (Jennifer Aniston) as Claire Bennett was great but so was the often overlooked (Adriana Barraza) as Silvana and (Sam Worthington) husband to the late Nina Collins (Anna Kendrick) who killed herself by jumping off a busy overpass.

As much tragedy as the film boasts Jennifer Aniston's comedic timing and dry wit are perfectly utilized and while lighten the mood do not make light of the situations. Claire is heartbreaking to watch. You can see she's in agonizing pain physically and mentally. She also punishes herself by allowing men to use her body as if she has left it spiritually which is further emphasized when we see her having conversations with the deceased Nina.

Kudos to Aniston for allowing herself to be filmed in such an unattractive light. It just wouldn't have worked if she looked beautiful. I personally found this to be one of the best films of the year. It made me feel so many real emotions and that is great film making.",1429747200,12,1132,4.65

It is a character study. If you need a lot going on to keep your attention, it's not your kind of flick. If you haven't had relatable experiences, it may just seem like pointless pain.",1429747200,2,506,4.56043956043956

Pain, all kinds of pain, can ruin your life if you let it. What's worse are the things we do to avoid that pain. It can change you in ways you could never predict.

She spends her days trying to find help in a bottle and any other way she can think of. After meeting Ninas husband and son she starts to find a little clarity. This is a tough movie to review. The acting is very good and Aniston is great in this. Totally different than anything she has ever done and I think she should do more of this. On the other hand though, not much happens and this movie is unbelievably depressing. You really just watch Claire deal with her pain, emotional and physical while feeling sorry for her and being angry at her at the same time.

7022278,4,B00TRK0ODC,"Cake is a study of profound grief.  Paralyzing, heart-wrenching, indescribable grief. Each of the characters in this film address their losses as best they can.  Jennifer Aniston does a superb job of showing the main character inching her way through losses of her child, her marriage, her looks, her mobility, her suicidal friend, and even her support group.  She turns to prescription drugs, alcohol, sex with a random man, and hostility in an effort to avoid facing the emotional pain.  She is surrounded by a talented supporting cast, each of whom shows in their own behavior healthier ways of dealing with emotional trauma.  The story moves along slowly,in the same way that people move slowly in processing tragedy in their own lives. There is an uplifting message in that those who truly love her stick around, despite her self-absorption,  so typical of someone severely depressed and bereaved.  I found the ending satisfying, as Aniston finally faces her greatest loss, the one which has left her in the greatest emotional and physical pain.  I agree with others who have suggested that an Oscar nomination was in order for Aniston's portrayal.  She's come a long way as an actress, and hopefully will continue to be given substantive roles in the future.",1429056000,13,1264,5.009569377990431

7022284,5,B00TRK0ODC,"Claire Bennett (Jennifer Aniston) is in a Chronic Pain Support Group being led by Annette (Felicity Huffman). She is suffering horrible physical pain (but what of emotional pain that runs even more deep?) that keeps her separate, isolated and housebound unable to sit straight up in a chair for too long if at all. The group is discussing a woman, Nina Collins (Anna Kendrick) who has taken her own life. When Annette asks what they think, a sarcastic and caustic ridiculing comes from Claire costing her the place with the other people assembled in the group. She has already alienated her husband and the reason why she is suffering so much isn't explained until midway through the film. She is marred with scars all over her body, but her emotional scars are just as obvious to see. One wonders just how this has happened and the circumstances of Nina's suicide also. What has happened to these women and why?

Nina still plays a role in the story as she communicates with an emotionally agonizing and addicted Claire in her dreams and hallucinations. This engagement brings about a conversation even though she is obviously not there. Claire receives her visits which bring an understanding of sorts. While Nina did commit suicide, Claire who has lost all hope in anything getting better for herself lives with a constant suicidal ideation of her own. She has a more upscale lifestyle that I can only surmise came from some sort of legal settlement at this point as there isn't a well-developed backstory. I didn't need one to believe Claire to have money as there are ways of support that could have come from the former or another settlement like alimony. She has a wily personal aide and housekeeper, Silvana (Adriana Barraza) who also helps her obtain her painkillers in an illegal fashion and attempts to keep her on her toes. She is heavily addicted to substances when the nature of this is the more one takes, the higher the tolerance the body gains to them, thus needing increased amounts which Claire becomes desperate for. Substance abuse is an illness in itself and the film does take a more compassionate look at the condition by not shying away from it.

She sees a physical therapist, Bonnie (Mamie Gummer) for aquatic physical therapy to help gain movement and body strength. Of course, she is quite facetious with her too, but she does have her bitingly witty moments. Patients experiencing a lot of pain of any kind do have drastic changes in personality at times. They can come off as unresponsive toward help, bitter and feel an overwhelming hopelessness about their futures. Claire's personality does inhabit all of the former. She appears to put up a fight with her words of a caustic, then comically sarcastic, nature. It is nearly impossible to live with day in and day out pain, emotional and physical, and the direction of people's entire lives can be thrown with just one single traumatic incident. This leaves them having to pick up the pieces when they may not even be agile enough to move. I had much sympathy for Claire even through her stubborn nature and her intense struggle. She drastically wants to know how to get in touch with Nina's address, will she gain it and what would it mean for her now? She may have something to offer or learn from the people that Nina left behind. Her husband, Roy Collins (Sam Worthington) is who she finds herself having an affecting relationship with and the audience wonders if she can turn her life around.

Daniel Barnz directs from the screenplay by Patrick Tobin and brings to life a woman's personal heart wrenching struggle with her life, her fears of growing older, her thoughts of just giving up on herself and gives Jennifer Aniston a grittier role I truly cared about. I liked her portrayal in this movie as I enjoyed  her portrayal in ""The Good Girl"", another dramatic role I felt she excelled in. This film may not appeal to every viewer, but hopefully it can be a push for knowledge concerning the individual severity of sufferers with chronic physical and/or emotional pain and the quality of life that results from it. A truly good character study in itself that offers so much to think about ...",1428710400,25,4184,4.758953168044077

A mother in emotional turmoil due to the loss of her son. A woman who (in spite of chronic pain and overuse of narcotics) finds a way to carry on an affair with the pool boy. We never find out what happened to her - there is a slight allusion to some type of accident, but it's not clear if she or her son was injured/killed in the accident. She cannot sit up straight in the car, but we are never able to figure out why,and yet the big ending is that she sits her car seat up straight. It is a mess of various types of painful human condition. Aniston's performance is mediocre and we never really gain the sympathy needed to care about her struggle - whatever it is. Is it pain? Is it drugs? Is it the loss of her child? Is it her inability to form a relationship? It seems to be all of these, but they are hobbled together in the most disjointed story.

7022287,4,B00TRK0ODC,"I was talking to my sister recently, about how I would like to see Jennifer stretch herself just a bit as an actress.  My sister said, ""I like her movies."" I replied, ""Name one that you would consider memorable"".  She couldn't do it.

I guess people make decisions about their careers that are practical, as it seems Aniston has done.  She is very ""watchable"", and has made a good living playing the ""good girl"" all these years.  It is SO refreshing to see her not rely on her charm and looks, and finally play a memorable dramatic role, and carry a film.

I think she did a damn good job as the affluent matron hooked on prescription drugs.  I DON'T think she was snubbed at the Oscars, as some did.  Just because an actor gains some weight, and turns in a believable performance, doesn't automatically qualify them for an award, for God's sakes!

I think if she does a few more roles like this, and hits on a REALLY great one, it will mean more to her, and prove to her peers and audiences she deserves a position as not only a popular celebrity, but an established excellent comedic and dramatic actor.",1428624000,7,1105,4.430693069306931
7022288,5,B00TRK0ODC,"Jennifer gave a riveting performance in this ""too close to life"" movie about a woman with chronic pain. This is not a comedy (ok, it is a dark comedy) and yet there are parts that I couldn't help laughing about. I raced to the theaters to see it because I suffer from chronic pain.  I'm happy to report that I'm not in as much pain as Jennifer's character, but I completely understand her frustration with life, her desire to curse the whole world out, the desire to toss her husband to the curb.  By the end of the movie we learn that she has not only physical pain but also is battling emotional scars from the thing that caused the physical pain.  This too makes sense, I fell down the stairs which triggered the downhill spiral and also had a four month long miscarriage.

These life changing events leave us at a cross-road: do we shut down? Or dig in our heals and fight for life? Fight for some sort of happiness in our life? At the beginning, it appears that she is shutting down or just going through the motions, but is not trying at all to find happiness. What happens next is for you to find out.  I highly recommend this movie to understand the emotions that come with chronic pain. It's a misunderstood condition in the world and one for which most people have little patience.  It's a hard movie to watch, but made me smile throughout as I was so proud of Jennifer for giving chronic pain a voice.",1427587200,80,1412,4.349809885931559

8702951,3,B00TRK0ODC,"... but it all just left me a bit flat.  Aniston plays a woman injured in a car crash that kills her son.  She's in constant pain from the accident.  The movie sort of documents her relationships with those around her.  It's good, but just not that compelling.  On the other hand, maybe it's closer to real life than movies usually are.  For instance, she could have fallen in love with Sam Worthington's character and lived happily ever after (maybe that happens after the movie ends).  I don't feel like I wasted my time, but it's not a movie I'd watch again.",1524441600,,561,4.4411764705882355
