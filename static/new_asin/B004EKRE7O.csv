8427145,4,B004EKRE7O,"Ramgopal Varma comes up with a different kind of comedy. Everyone is after a briefcase which contains something valuable. Its a fun on the run kind of movie. Sanjay Dutt and Urmila Matondkar give an excellent performance. The best performance comes from Paresh Rawal. This is Paresh's Best performance after Andaz Apna Apna and Sir. The Cinematography and Sound Recording are excellent. The dialogues are very good. The climax is a let down. This is one movie that could have done well without songs. DAUD is about a runaway twosome who believe they have a 'crore' or two of gold in a black box. That it is not gold but a neutron bomb is obvious from the beginning. Sanjay Dutt, as Nandu, is a small time crook hired by a middleman for a gang of international smugglers out to destroy the nation. Urmila Matondkar, as Bhavani, is a cabaret dancer who tags along with Nandu in this DAUD from the police and the real thieves. In the process of evading the police and the smugglers, Nandu and Bhavani fall in love. But what will happen when the smuggler get their hands on the neutron bomb? Will Nandu and Bhavani leave the city or will they try to stop the smugglers before they set off the bomb?",1302480000,,1194,4.532407407407407
