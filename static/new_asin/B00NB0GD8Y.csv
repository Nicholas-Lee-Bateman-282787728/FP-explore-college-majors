8677073,5,B00NB0GD8Y,"""Lars and the Real Girl"" is one of those obscure films that few people seem to have heard of but everyone I've shared it  enjoyed. Many have gone on to purchase their own copy so they can watch it over and over again like me. This is something I rarely do with movies, with the exception of very few.

I found it to be a pleasant movie for a rainy day.",1465603200,,468,3.9263157894736844
