1640885,4,B00005OCK9,"These movies of ""Dr. Who"" was made during the 1st season run of the popular BBC series when it was being filmed in black & white. Terry Nation wanted to bring the Daleks to the big screen & in color and did so by making these 2 movies.. The 1st one is based on an episode during the first season called ""The Dead Planet"" with the late William Hartnell as the Doctor. However, in the movie version it's the late Peter Cushing. Almost the same scipt but with some slight variations. The 2nd movie is an original script with the Daleks returning in the 22nd century to take over the Earth and move the entire planet to another location. The SFX are not too bad. The music for the 2nd movie sounds too much like something out of James Bond.",1007251200,,736,4.264285714285714
1640886,5,B00005OCK9,"Dr Who and the Daleks and Invasion Earth are two films made for cinema release during the height of the Dalek mania. This is *not* the Dr Who of the television series - this Doctor has been doctored to appeal to ""families,"" so... he's a human (admittedly a rather odd one) with a family which includes a rather cute little girl-genius. The actor playing the Doctor wasn't available at the time of shooting (too busy with the series), so he was replaced by Peter Cushing - a well-known horror movie actor.
With the higher budget of a film, they were able to do some spiffy special effects (unfortunately campy by today's standards) and created some fine Daleks which were later borrowed by the tv series.
""Dalekmania"" is a really interesting feature about the Dalek fad. It features interviews with cast members from the films, and shows lots of wonderfully silly merchandise that was sold. (I want some! It's hilarious!)
Good for the completist Dr Who fan, but expect to get a much sillier Dr Who experience than usual.",1005696000,17,1019,4.730337078651686
1640887,4,B00005OCK9,"Terry Nation, who came up with the fictional race called the Daleks, wanted to make money.  Without his greed and the wave of fandom that rocked the UK at the time the Doctor Who? TV series came out we would have never had the Daleks on the big screen.  This two movies, plus the DVD documentary is a must for any fans of the Doctor, the Daleks, or Peter Cushing.  Dr. Who and the Daleks even has a audio commentary.  This is the first time many fans saw the Daleks in bright, shiny, color.  Even if you have the movies on tape you still may wish to pick this set up and give the tapes away!",1227657600,,591,4.060344827586207
1640888,3,B00005OCK9,"The difficulty I had with these films is they seem only to exist in order to capitalise on the Dalek legend. Peter Cushing was never an actual, ""Dr Who"" in the many TV series incarnations he had, that fact makes these film suffer instantly. Most Who fans have recollections of one of the Dr's incarnations as a favourite, My own favourite was the whackily sublime Tom Baker who series also featured the robot assistant dog, K9.

 One has to have some memory or notion of each Dr Who's foibles to make his incarnation believable, Cushing only played him in these 2 films and lives in many people's memories as a long time actor in the Hammer Horror genre. There isn't much else to help you recognise the series here either, the assistants are different and there is just a little too much obvious comedy on offer. You may have giggled at silly monsters and wobbly sets but Dr Who was also a serious business!

 The main thing that gave Dr Who his enduring appeal was Sci Fi with a dry and whacky flirtation with British dottiness.

 These films spell that dottiness out too much and loose an essential component of what makes Dr Who appeling as a result, Cushing is most like Hartnell but is too enrgetic and frivalous to carry it off, he's more like a witch finder general as he was in ""Twins of Evil""; Dr Who needs some refinement and Cushing doesn't give him much.

 The assistants are whacky ""Scooby Doo"" style detective kids - wrong again! I think the films tried to ""Americanise"" the Dr for more mass appeal, failing to realise in so doing that American fans like him the way he was on TV.

 On the plus side the Daleks do not dissapoint in their menace, quite how an electric kitchen bin with a sink plunger snout can be so scarry I don't know, but they are!

 Die hard fans should peel their eyes soon, The BBC is riviving the good Dr, a new series is set air in the UK on the 26th March 2005; the first for 16 years! This time played by Christopher Eccleston who you may remember as Nicole Kidman's husband in ""The Others"".",1111363200,13,2031,4.401069518716578
1640889,3,B00005OCK9,"This is one of those instances where the Boxed set falls short of expectaions.  While the set comes with a 3rd disc of bonus material ""Dalekmania""'s interviews are nice additions - the documentary lacks the feeling and excitement of the interviews included along with the various Television eppisodes.  The additional trailers included are entertaining but only as examples of the formulaic trailers of sci fi in the mid 60's.

The movies themselves are really quite good.  Vibrant colored Daleks and prety good acting.  While the original stories were adapted from 1st Doctor William Hartnell's The Mutants (the Daleks) and Dalek invasion of Earth they are seen on a much grander scale.

Peter Cushing's Doctor Who (as he is referred to in the movies) is a much warmer friendly protrayal.  but the compainion characters lack the depth that was created within the series.  Like the Sylvester McCoy eppisodes it seems budget used for effects outwieghs character development.  The second film Dalek invasion of Earth 2150 ad is very well made and has some great comedic play to it.  the Scenes of Tom the cop as a roboman are truly hysterical.",1097107200,6,1141,4.98941798941799
1640890,3,B00005OCK9,"For both Doctor Who and Peter Cushing fans these films are curiosities(however well made or liked).Released at the time to cash in on DALEKMANIA they were,for some time,the only example of early Doctor Who available to American TV viewers. Their success no doubt convinced the BBC(back in 1966)that the programme's audience would accept a different actor portraying the title character which in turn allowed the series to run over 25 years.
My only problem with The Doctor Who Collection is how it's been packaged. A 3-disc boxed set!?!The two films each run less than 85 minutes and could easily fit on a single DVD with room left over for bonus features. The DALEKMANIA disc provides no real insight into the series/movies/actors or monsters and was made several years earlier to promote the VHS release!
Anchor Bay no doubt thought Doctor Who/Peter Cushing fans could be milked for this release which smacks of greed and contempt. I have no doubt with the advent of DVD-ripping technology bootlegs will abound. More power to them",1081814400,7,1032,5.005813953488372
1640891,5,B00005OCK9,"I love these movies and this is a great way to watch em! Peter Cushing is very entertaining as the doctor and it's too bad he only played the part twice. These movies are so sixties it's fantastic! Im a sucker for sci fi which isn't afraid to be fun and the Daleks are such great villans! Both movies entertain and the Dalekmania disc is a nice bonus.
By the way, who is Mary Tamm? She's not in these movies.",1074124800,4,408,4.1125
1640892,3,B00005OCK9,"I have been a WHO fan forever.
Tom Baker is outstanding as usual.
I recommend that you seek episodes without Mary Tamm as she is very pushy and obnoxiously masculine really degrades the show.
Would have been 5 star though Tamm made it very trying.
All other aspects are excellent.",1064534400,4,280,4.62
1640893,3,B00005OCK9,"I have a sort of love/hate relationship with these films. As a tried-and-true fan of the TV series, I always feel a little bit like they're ""not the real thing"", just ""trying to make some cash"" - a fairly common attitude for a fan. And that's exactly why they were made...but really, don't they deserve a place in Doctor Who history, too?
The first film is admittedly one I have never been enamoured of. It's very, very sixties - the pink plastic set, the Thals' makeup, the wild Dalek colour schemes, and the corny humour all contribute to a definite feeling of kitsch. I have to be in a very certain frame of mind to enjoy it. The second film is, in my opinion, much more entertaining. There's real tension and horror in the situations presented, and it compacts the story nicely from the TV serial's 150 minutes to the film's 84. Both the Daleks' colour schemes and Cushing's performance are more subdued, and the flying saucer is very cool. I'd much rather watch this than the TV version, 'The Dalek Invasion of Earth'.
Both movies are presented anamorphically in their original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 - a real revelation to me, as I expected the traditional 1.85:1 or even 1.66:1. The transfers are just gorgeous, boasting a remarkably clear picture and strong, vibrant colours, including very true blacks. If you've only seen the films on pan 'n' scan video, you just haven't seen them! There is some grain evident in the picture - more noticeably in ""Daleks - Invasion Earth"", thanks to the extensive outdoor scenes - and the occasional shimmering suggestion of edge enhancement, but the films really look extraordinary for 35-year-old pictures. I don't know who remastered them, but clearly work has been done. Very nice indeed. Unfortunately, I can't give a completely clean bill of health to the films. Regrettably, Anchor Bay was provided with the wrong edit of ""Daleks - Invasion Earth"". This causes the film to open with the title sequence, followed by the pre-credits robbery scene. It's terribly obvious, since the scene ends with a musical cue leading into the titles, and you can't even correct it with the memory function on your player (although the titles and robbery are different chapters, each ends with the fade-up from black to the next scene). I fervently hope Anchor Bay takes action to re-release the film in its proper form.
Both discs include a nice smattering of extras, including their original trailers, a ""History of Doctor Who"" text essay, extensive photo gallieries, and an in-depth biography of star Peter Cushing. ""Dr. Who and the Daleks"" also includes a commentary with actresses Jennie Linden (Barbara) and Roberta Tovey (Susan), monitored by journalist and Cushing film historian Jonathan Sothcott. The pace of the commentary is leisurely - perhaps too leisurely - and the discussion is often very generalised and anecdotal. It's a fun commentary, yes, but nowhere as good as those on the BBC's ""Doctor Who"" discs. Take it for what it's worth, enjoy 83 minutes with some very friendly people, and then realise you'll probably never choose the 'Commentary' option again.
The third disc contains the 1995 documentary ""Dalekmania"". Containing interviews with many of the actors and actresses involved, as well as Dalek creator Terry Nation, stuntman Eddie Powell, and others, the 57-minute film is a wonderful companion to the two Dalek pictures, and very much in the vein of Kevin Davies' other, better-known Doctor Who documentary, ""More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS"". Pleasantly, he transfer for ""Dalekmania"" is equal to that of the two films, with a bright, vivid picture marred only by a bit of grain. It's really nice to see it treated as well as the main attractions, as I had imagined a more VHS-quality print.
Overall, this 3-DVD set went far and beyond my expectations. The only thing that could make it better, in my opinion, is if Anchor Bay issued a corrected version of ""Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."", and replaced those discs already purchased. I highly recommend the set or the individual discs to any fan of the Dalek movies, as well as ""Doctor Who"" fans who haven't yet tried the films - this is definitely the way to see them! Maybe DVD release will finally bring Peter Cushing's portrayal of the Doctor, and the Dalek films as a whole, the respect they deserve.",1037923200,55,4323,4.875
1640894,5,B00005OCK9,"Just bought this boxed set, a day I've dreamed of, for decades.
Beautifuly remastered, crisp and clear as the first day of release. Having only seen the pan and scan versions on television, I never realized the true scale of these productions.
Especially ""Invasion earth"", shot on many exterior locations, with a much bigger budget than the first film. It's also the first post-apocalyptic sci-fi vision of the future, so prevalent in modern films today. I think any fan of science fiction would enjoy this, not just fans of Dr. Who. The one hour documentary provides great insight into the films, but the biggest plus for me, is the original British movie trailers.
Highest regards to Anchor Bay, for another job well done.",1028592000,3,724,4.894308943089431
1640895,4,B00005OCK9,"These two movies, dispite the fact that they are compiled from two sets of multi part episodes with characters and events shuffled around are actually quite enjoyable.
The First ""Dr. Who & The Daleks"" places an absent minded professor and his family on a planet in the far distant future where the first of two races gets around in a machine known as a Dalek, very deadly and very strange. The second race are the Thals who abhore violence and war, but are forced to wage a new war against these Daleks, knowing that only one race can survive.
In Daleks Invasion Earth, another story loosely based on the Dr. Who serial by the same title, places the Daleks on Earth 200 some odd years in the future, where they have robotized the human race into a type of slave labor, but fortunately, the Doctor and his friends come across an underground who they help.
Originally, there were were supposed to be several more Dr. Who movies, but several factors shut down the concept, first: Peter Cushing's health wasn't at its best, the second movie wasn't as widely accepted as the first, amongst other things. Other movies whics were supposed to be made were: The Daleks Masterplan & the Chase.
For fans of the series, who can apprieciate the differences, some major, some subtle, this is for you. For fans of 60's sci-fi movies, this is for you, if you are followers of Peter Cushing or Roberta Tovey this set of movies are for you. There are actually very few I wouldn't reccommend this movie to, it has something for everybody.",1021939200,9,1519,4.608856088560886
1640896,4,B00005OCK9,"Although it isn't listed on the Amazon description. the ""Dr. Who and the Daleks"" DVD has a commentary track featuring the two female stars of the movie and a Peter Cushing expert. I'm glad they managed to work in a commentary track on at least one of these DVD releases although it would be nice if they had done both movies. The Dalek documentary is fairly interesting as well. The thing I always ask myself when I see these sorts of things is ""Where are all these Dr. Who enthusiasts?"". You don't see them like you used to. Maybe I'm just too young and missed the boat or something.
Dr. Who and the Daleks is a slightly different and upgraded version of the original Dalek story. Peter Cushing is an elderly man named ""Dr. Who"" who lives with his two granddaughters and invented a time machine in his back yard. While showing it off to his grand daughter's date (Ian) they are all accidentally sent to another planet where they meet the Dalek's. An alien race that was so mutated by a great war that they had to build special machines to live in. They are now evil and bent on destruction of all non Dalek life forms. This movie has a lot of great visuals but can be difficult to watch by even the most hardened Dr. Who fans.
Dalek Invasion of Earth 2150 AD is also an altered version of an original Dr. Who story. The Dr. and his granddaughters pick up a different male companion and end up on earth in the far future where the Dalek's have conquered the planet. With a little ingenuity and dumb luck they free the earth from the Dalek's tyranny. This movie, while again having pretty good visuals, is even more difficult to watch than the first. But it has it's moments. My favorite scene is at the beginning when the police man stumbles into the Tardis. I'm a little upset because I recall this scene as originally being before the opening credits (at least that's where it is on the video release) which added a lot more drama and excitement to the movie as a whole. Also, somehow the Doctor manages to return the officer back to before the time he was taken which is a paradox that makes absolutely no sense.
Dalekmania, while being a cheap and boring documentary, gives some good insight into the whole Dr. Who film phenomena thingy. You learn some interesting tid bits like they wanted to make a 3rd movie for about 20 years after the release of the 2nd film. They considered everything from adapting the 3rd Dalek storyline ""The Chase"" to making a Dalek movie without the Doctor at all.
Bottom Line... I like this collection but I recommend it ONLY for people who are big Dr. Who fans or big Peter Cushing fans.",1009411200,12,2621,4.439834024896266

7948725,5,B00005OCK9,"Great classic British Sci-Fi fun and nothing explicit or graphic.
These films are based upon stories from the TV serials, the early 1963-66 William Hartnell era.
Both are very well done with large sets and professional special effects. It's interesting to see the Daleks in color this early in their time. They are just as annoying in these films as they are on television.

I haven't seen the TV story that Dr. Who and The Daleks is based on but it is a very good film and I really like it. It is more sophisticated, story wise, than the sequel.
I didn't know Daleks had a thing for Lava Lamps, very cool.
The Thal alien men, enemies of the Daleks, are fairly tough despite their excessive eye makeup use.

Daleks-Invasive Earth 2150 AD is derived from The Dalek Invasion of Earth, a classic 1964 masterpiece featuring William Hartnell.
It is definitely one of my favorite Doctor Who stories but the film is very different. Not nearly as intense and atmospheric, but fun in its own way.
The Robomen in the TV version are far more menacing, almost disturbing.
The film version has a comedy focus which made it a great vehicle for one of my favorite British character actors, Bernard Cribbins. A great talent and a sincere performance.

Peter Cushing as Doctor Who just doesn't jive with Hartnell's Doctor. For one thing the film Who is human not alien. Huge difference in concept and quite limiting in my opinion.
Cushing's Who is more grandfatherly harmless, not very assertive.

Dalekmania is an intimate remembrance for the making of the two films and some pop culture influences, mainly merchandising. It runs about 57 minutes.
I couldn't get it to play right at first, for whatever reason but I paused my player pressed Play again and it was fine.

Video quality is very good throughout, looks like a high definition restoration but some scratches are still visible.
Daleks-Invasion Earth has a subtle but annoying noise in its audio during quiet scenes.

This is a good release for Doctor Who completists but some may want to pass on it. Dr. Who doesn't have much to do with Doctor Who, if you know what I mean. I find it an enjoyable curiosity myself.
I prefer the Optimum Region 2 PAL version, it's more professional (DVD not DVD-R as made by Amazon) than the NTSC Region 1 release. They both have the same video quality but extras are different.

7948730,5,B00005OCK9,"I don't understand why these films are so underrated. They've got classic Dr. Who stories in them, great performances, lots of action, Daleks, and Peter Cushing as the time-travelling Doctor. What more can a Whovian ask for? These films take place outside the continuity of the TV series. In this version, the Doctor is not an alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, instead he's just an eccentric scientific inventor from Earth named Dr. Who who invents his space/time machine - the TARDIS. But although Peter Cushing's Doctor is from Earth in this version, he's got pretty much all the same traits as the Doctor we all know and love from the TV series. These films ""Dr. Who and the Daleks"" and ""Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."" are remakes (and in my opinion, superior remakes) of the Doctor Who TV episodes ""The Daleks"" and ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"".

The Plot:

In ""Dr. Who and the Daleks"", the eccentric Dr. Who decides to take his companions (his granddaughters Susan and Barbara and Barbara's boyfriend Ian) on trip through time and space in his new invention, the TARDIS (a remarkable craft that can take them to anywhere in the universe and to any time period). Ian accidentally falls on a control lever sending them off course and to a mysterious alien world in the distant future. They have arrived on the planet Skaro, home to the warring evil robotic-mutant Daleks and the peaceful humanoid Thals. The Daleks want to completely exterminate the Thals from the face of the planet. Now it's up to the Doctor and his companions to battle these evil creatures and save the universe!

In ""Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."", the Doctor, his granddaughter Susan, his niece Louise, and their young friend Tom Campbell travel to Earth's future in the year 2150 to find the planet has been conquered and enslaved by their evil archenemies the Daleks. Now they have to join forces with a small band of human resistance fighters in order to retake the planet in this epic action-packed sequel.
