7935056,1,B00005A9S4,"i have to say i think burt looks good here and is very good as the hard drinking cop,it's just that the rest of the movie is so bad that burt's acting gets lost!

  a sleeze ball crook is found dead(in a most origanl way,the only other good thing in the movie) and everything points to burt. theresa russell(lost and very poor as a lawyer) takes his case and they set out to find the killer. michael crichton directs this mess with out any real fire except for the opening scenes. and yet another nail in the coffin of burt's career!!",1150070400,,534,4.267326732673268
