3105380,3,B0013F2ESM,"Wynona Ryder teaming up with the writer who did Heathers is a cool proposition. Well if it were 1992. But re-teaming two decades after introducing the concept of a dark comedy upon teenagers doesn't have the same cachet had it not taken so long. The result of the eighteen year wait is Sex and Death 101, which, despite the title, is a much lighter affair than their first outing as it focuses much more on the former.

The sex part of the equation comes courtesy of Simon Baker (Red Planet) who receives a list of everyone he has had slept with a week before his wedding. The problem is that his fiance, Carol Vessey (Happy Gilmore), is only number twenty-nine of one hundred and one starting off a debate of destiny and free will and who knowing the names of every girl you going to sleep with, even if it is a lot, a good thing or bad thing. And then there is the flip side knowing when you don't have a chance.

Some hilarity ensues as Barker transverses his new found list which has him running into some girls on and off his list including a centerfold (Sophie Monk, Date Movie), a doctor (Leslie Bibb, Popular), someone who provides the Death part of the title (Wynona Ryder, Heathers), lesbians, and though not Pat's on the list, there is a Terry. Where the hilarity really excels is when Patton Oswalt (The King of Queens) hits the screen, though telling you his role is a little spoilerish.

Though being spoilerish with this film is hard because it is easy to tell the ending within the first five minutes of the film and nothing happens between then and the end (a too long two hours) that even gets you off the scent of how the story ends up. Luckily the journey there was half way decent if not in part to some of Oswalt's suggestions on getting around the list. Oh and did I mention Mindy Cohn, yes that Mindy Cohn, makes an appearance?",1217289600,,1851,4.406432748538012
3105381,4,B0013F2ESM,"What would you do if you know what would happen in your lifetime? Would you try to change your decisions, avoid the displeasing parts or meet everything head on? Well, writer/director Daniel Waters (Heathers, 1989) attempts to answer this question. What results is a satire of somewhat dark elements, oddly clever and maybe also be considered a horror flick in a certain way. ""SEX and DEATH 101"" is a sex comedy that is refreshing since it leaves the usual stereotypical elements of over-sexed teenagers and delves into the sex life of a guy over 30 (or 35?).

Roderick Blank (Simon Baker) is guy who seemingly has it all; he's about to get married, has a great job as an executive in a fast food franchise called ""Swallows"" and has a lot of friends. His entire life is turned upside down when he receives a mysterious e-mail that lists all the woman he has and will ever sleep with; PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE. 101 names to be exact, and the funny thing is, his bride to be is only number 29. What's a guy to do?
Meanwhile, an enigmatic femme fatale called ""Death Nell"" (Winona Ryder) has become an urban folk hero because she targets those men who have committed violence against women.

""Sex and Love 101"" is a dark comedy that somewhat reinforces the male anxiety. To settle down or to stay a bachelor forever? There are certain advantages and disadvantages, of course, and the character of Roderick Blank explores the why, the how and the when questions. I rather thought there were three acts in the film; Knowledge becomes power and power corrupts absolutely, the pursuit of an unreachable goal and the fear of your inevitable destiny. Personally, if I do come across such a list, I would probably be a little frightened but at the same time very curious. There is nothing like knowing exactly what your future holds, don't it? Yes and no.

Roderick Blank goes through his list and the film results in showing quite a bit of nudity. From a stripper, a centerfold named Cynthia Rose (Sophia Monk), a busload of beautiful virgins, to ultra-hotties: Bambi (Natassia Malthe) and Thumper (Pollyanna McIntosh), from a homeless woman to a leper, Blank goes through his list and the greatest relief from all of this is the fact he won't die until he has slept with each and every woman on the list. For the first half of the film, once you see a female character, you know that she'll be around for the next 5-15 minutes and she'll probably play a turning point in Blank's life. Miranda (Leslie Bibb) also represents the woman that Blank considers a pursuit and conquest---the one who put him in the ""friend zone"" and she isn't in his list. This element actually represented the idea that one can change his destiny. Well, Blank even considered necrophilia and castration just to offset the inevitable. The proceedings do have a `dark' humorous side as Blank considers his options and does contain some hinted amount of surprises.

Now just how did this list come from? Actually, the answer may be simpler than you may expect and well, it`s a bit hazy.  Three men called Alpha (Robert Wisdom), Beta (Tanc Sade) and ""Fred"" (Patton Oswalt) are the guardians of an enigmatic group.  Alpha is the intelligence, Beta is the deduction and Fred, well, he's the wild idea. You won't be far off in comparing this trio to the three ""Norns"" of fate in Norse Mythology and the these mystical beings of destiny are even present in Greek myth; who foresee the fates of both Gods and Men. Only instead of being women, this trio is made out of men. Fred is the one who feeds Blank with all the crazy ideas that he is about to have a lot of sex. Alpha well, he puts everything into play in a manner of speaking, he manipulates Blank into making his own direction.

For someone destined to have a lot of women in his lifetime, the actor has to be real smooth and devilishly handsome. I'm no judge to the male attributes but I thought that Simon Baker was convincing enough to pull it off. The film does have a clever script so whatever requires a large suspension of disbelief can be bought into, even though his acting may seem a little mechanical quite often. The supporting cast is led by Mindy Cohn (who plays Simon's confidant Trixie) adds a lot of depth and charm to the film's screenplay whenever she says ""I'm so glad I'm a lesbian"". Blank's interactions are competent enough that it does assist the film in its ""non-sex"" moments and rather fleshes out more of Simon's character. Why the heck does he have the last name ""Blank"" anyway? Winona Ryder may have limited screen time but her role is very significant. She plays the woman who has been abused and who finally realized that she is her own ""Prince Charming"". I do believe her character of ""Death Nell"" is a social metaphor or maybe for feminism. Winona is charming in her portrayal, well, in an imbalanced sort of way.

The direction was competent enough to keep me interested for its entirety. I was entertained but not really to the point of giving praise. The film clocks in at almost two hours, and for a movie like this, it may seem somewhat overlong and slow-paced. However, the film did attempt to fully flesh out the lead character, although, the plot itself had very little to work with. It took me a bit longer to warm up to Simon Baker but I did find the film to be a satisfying enough diversion. It's a welcome departure from the stereotypical sex comedies.

SEX and DEATH 101 is worthwhile effort, it's sexy, funny and twisted in its own way; and yep, there`s lot of skin in this movie. There were moments that were downright hilarious that I rather forgave its perfunctory climax and I thought it`s a charming piece of comedy. Sometimes it's better not to know and just go along for the ride of life.

3105382,2,B0013F2ESM,"Hmmmmm.  There's a lot to like about this movie.  Unfortunately there's more not to like.  The movie succeeded in making me want to think, but the more I found myself thinking the less I liked: (a) the characters; (b) the premise; and (c) the slickness the tale was bathed in.

The premise: Roderick (""Rod""), a wealthy, handsome young man with ""it all"" and about to be married, receives a list of 101 names comprising everyone he has had and ever will have sex with.  He falters, causing his fiancee to bail (this happens early and you'll see it coming - no spoiler here), but what ensues is the ridiculous notion that he must sleep with every woman on the list in breathtaking succession.  Gaining in his momentum of popularity, Simon Baker does what he can with Roderick, but the character alternates between slick annoyance and mildly pitiable.

His friends worship him, women can't resist him, and his Trixie, his ever gleeful, lesbian secretary, (Mindy Cohen of ""Facts of Life"" fame) tries to steer him on the right track - but he's having none of it.

The plot involves three mysterious men in a bare white room letting Rod in on some of the secrets of the universe and a sexual predator named ""Death Nell"" (Winona Rider in a wig and costume parade) who lures men to their demise.

The ending leaves more questions and holes and by the end the film's two hours felt like I'd just sat through Wagner's Ring cycle, with fewer jokes.

3105383,3,B0013F2ESM,"I was surprised, while listening to the commentary track, to find out that this movie was intended to be a comedy - with deeper meaning.  I actually got the deeper meaning part of it - although, it wasn't all THAT deep - but I don't remember laughing more than once or twice when I watched it.  Maybe I was in the wrong mood, or maybe I should have had a couple of drinks before watching it, but it was seriously not funny.  It lacked both the low-brow ""humour"" that's so prevalent these days in most comedies and the intelligent humour of writers like Joss Whedon and Bryan Fuller.  That's not to say the movie was a complete waste of time.  I did enjoy seeing the story unfold and I liked the interaction of the characters.  The ending was actually quite good, and not what I was expecting (which is always a plus, in my book).  I'll probably watch it one more time just to make sure I didn't miss anything important, but this is not a movie that I'd put on my regular repeat viewing schedule",1217203200,,994,4.311827956989247
3105384,2,B0013F2ESM,"I remember loving it when I first saw it on video, even through its absurd moments... but, when I go back to it now, I'm left sort of ambivalent. And that's sort of the same feeling I get with Sex and Death 101, another of Danny Waters'.

The basic setup is that Roderick Blank has just been sent a list... a list with every woman he's ever slept with and every woman he ever WILL sleep with. His fianc is number 29... on a list of 101.

The various players are believable in their roles. Baker swaggers through Blank's sexcapades with the all too familiar arrogant smirk we've seen before on many a ladies' man, Ryder puts on Slater's shoes this go-round as the serial killer to be (though she never actually seems to kill anyone), and Patton Oswalt has some seriously cringe-worthy, though funny, one-liners that are quickly eating up his family-friendly cred garnered from lending his voice to Remy of Pixar's Ratatouille.

Then there's the veritable cornucopia of beautiful women laid before the very (un)lucky Mr. Blank. Mmmmm. Where was I?

S&D101 is a mediocre movie.

It's sexy, scandalous, and sometimes thoughtful, but suffers in practice. Problems mostly arise from just how much Danny wants us to take in. We're almost never on board with Blank as he breezes through women, even when the list puts him in bed with some seriously disturbing women and situations. Blank's narration is often there to spin things, but also betrays us several times for the sake of Danny's message. Wynona's `Death Nell' story line seems tacked on with very little point other than to represent a threat to Blank's oat sowing as, since he's sleeping with so many women, one of them is bound to be the mysterious post-coital assaulter.

Waters plays with this sort of blas magical realism that fails to keep us believing (in the characters and the film in general) and the rough cinematography and directing give the picture the feel that it's a student's piece.

Still... there are plenty of great lines and quite a few really great individual moments. Its just that, overall, they never gel together as a movie and are, instead, just that... a series of great lines and individual moments filmed to no effect.

At best, this is a forgettable rental for when you're bored... and maybe suffering a mid-life crisis and trying to justify your affair.",1217203200,,2338,4.76980198019802
3105385,3,B0013F2ESM,"This is in some ways a fun, smart, sexy movie, but it was hard for me to enjoy it.  I'll briefly sum up the pros and cons, and then I'll include a note for the curious with some more detail and a bit of movie philosophy about why this didn't work for me.  Here's the set-up:

Rod (Simon Baker) is a good-looking, successful man, about to be married, who receives from a mysterious but apparently reliable source a list of all 101 people he has had and will have sex with in his lifetime, in chronological order.  There are a lot of names that come after his fiancee's.  He becomes increasingly obsessed with the list, seeking the women out, having a mix of experiences that soon tend to degrade his life.  A subplot about an avenging woman who puts men into comas, ""Death Nell"" (Winona Ryder), finally catches up to him, though not in the expected way (well, not supposed to be expected, at least).

First, the good news is that Baker is well chosen, looks the part and projects irony well.  He's warm and easy to like, even when he's a heel.  Ryder is fine too, giving the role all it seems to call for.

There are some funny things in this movie, but the humor overall isn't as adult as I'd like in what's supposed to be an adult sex comedy.  It varies quite a bit.  There's a more-than-juvenile but less-than-fully-mature sensibility to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the film as a whole, and though there are wry observations and some jokes that require a few brain cells--actually more than I realized, as explained in the commentary--there's also a fair amount that would be at home in American Pie.

The sexuality, while sometimes fun, is generally not all that interesting.  Actually fairly tame for an R-rated sex comedy (nudity, sexual motions, and crude references), but that shouldn't have kept it from being more alluring and creative.  From the commentary we learn that writer/director Daniel Waters felt there wasn't time to get more out of that side of the film.  It was a very low-budget movie, around $4 million.

There seems to be some effort to make something substantial of the metaphysical questions of fate and freedom, but that doesn't go very deep.  The metaphysical premise works mainly as a plot device.

I think I might have enjoyed the movie overall despite the mismatch with some of the humor except for one other thing.  There was what came across as an inhumane or at least non-humane sensibility competing with and undercutting what seemed to be efforts at genuine humanity.  This involved things like an attempt at necrophilia with a loved one and serious spousal abuse as the material for easy laughs, in addition to what seemed a general irony about everything.  I'll say more about that in my note below, for those who want more detail (and to see why my review has the title it does).

Some people won't be bothered by any of that, or might even like that edgy sensibility, and hopefully you can tell who you are from what I've said.  And you might find the mix of low and higher-than-average humor positively Shakespearean.

The special features include the commentary by Waters, which is well worth hearing if you want a better idea of what he had in mind.  He explains many allusions to classic movies and literature that I completely missed.  There's also a 17-minute featurette on the film called 101 Perversions, and the trailer.  117 minutes.

A note on the odd mix of seemingly inhumane humor with humane themes

*Spoiler alert.*  I've written the following so as to keep spoilers to a bare minimum, but there are a couple things some might see as spoilers.  Nothing that should spoil your overall experience of the film, I think.  This is a broad comedy, so it may seem odd to take this seriously, but how comedy works, or doesn't, is a serious subject!  Or at least one we can philosophize about and try to figure out.

The problem as I see it is that Waters mixes what seems inhumane humor into the more humane moments of the film, which never firmly establishes a humane point of view, despite what Waters appears to intend, based on the movie itself and his commentary.  For example, one of the few real, sustained cases of affection and earnest emotion is cut off with a comical thud of a death and ends with an attempt at necrophilia, also played for laughs.  Later, another sustained relationship is developed in part over a montage that plays serious spousal abuse for laughs.  The film seems too well summed up by its last lines:

""Life is a lot like death; it happens to everyone whether they like it or not.
The meaning of it all?  Honestly, who gives a f***.""

That's a play on the basic conceit of the movie, the original title of which was Truly F***ed, and in which the f-word has a major role.  And it appears to actually have a positive meaning, which can be inferred from the scene itself (without giving anything away about why this applies): you might as well enjoy the good in life and not worry about the meaning.  But given what came before and the continued ironic stance, it's impossible not to also register it as the blow-off of life that it sounds like.  Hard to believe that aspect wasn't also intentional.

Then again, despite his many intentional film allusions, Waters says in the commentary that the line ""the list is life"" wasn't intended as an echo of Schindler's List, that he didn't notice the connection until afterwards.  Waters also says that he had to remove September 11th references because the producers insisted.  I don't think he had a full grasp of some of his material, despite some very detailed ideas about it that come out in the commentary.  I don't think he saw how unstable the anything-goes mix is and how much it undermines the more earnest goals he implies he has.  At least, if he did see it, he doesn't let on.

In any case, we get very mixed signals about whether anything has the kind of value that would raise it above the level of cheap, undignified jokes.  It may be that Waters sees no conflict between cheap jokes and dignity, or thinks that the human condition is a mix of both, no part of which is beyond the reach of the other.  Nothing is sacred, or at least not so purely sacred.  I actually think there's something to that, in principle, but in practice the chemistry involved is volatile and complex.  Among other things, it seems to me that the respect for the higher stuff needs to be all the more strongly established to mix in the potentially undermining stuff, and that wasn't done here.  It comes across as uncertain all the way through, which undermined my investment in the genuine emotional aspects of the movie.

I could be wrong and welcome arguments to the contrary in comments.",1217203200,3,6711,4.612141652613828
3105386,3,B0013F2ESM,"What shall we say then...to this movie? Well..., it wasn't intended to win an Academy Award, it wasn't even intended to be nominated for an Academy Award. This, basically, then becomes an issue of entertainment...or a story with a moral. Sex and Death 101 might be called a black comedy but that is debatable.

Roderick Blank (Simon Baker) receives an anonymous email that lists all the women he has slept with & is going to be sleep with. Simon Baker is appropriately smarmy in the lead role, more stuck on himself than any woman he's had a relationship with. He's about to be married when this email comes in. The list contains 101 names; the 28 he has already slept with, the one he's about to marry & 72 more that are still in his future. We are treated to some of the encounters with these 72 but none are dwelt on very long. There are some funny complications on the way, in particular when there are two women that share the same name.

The second story line involves a femme fatale known as Death Nell (Winona Ryder) who is boring her dates into comas. The men she picks for her victims aren't terribly nice men but this is hardly touched upon.

All of this comes about because of some organization (eerily similar to Heaven but not that either) has a machine (please, not a computer!) that has sent out a few thousand emails erroneously. Some only contain dates which happens to be the final day of life for that particular individual. Apparently, the email to Roderick Blank is an unique one, no other email contains a list of named partners. This is never explained satisfactorily nor is the organization involved with this explained.

Most viewers will figure out where this is all leading to: the final encounter for Roderick Blank will be with Death Nell. Of course, this is the last thing he wants to do. The organization advises him not to have any more encounters with women in order to give them more time to stop Death Nell. At the time of this advice he has about twenty names left on the list so it sounds like sound advice. Unfortunately for him, while riding a bike he's hit by a bus loaded with 20 females (all aged 18 to 19) that are from a religious school on the way to a camp. After running over him, they all decide to take advantage of him & losing their sacredness. This leaves only one name on the list: Gillian De Raisx, better known as Death Nell.

The moral of the story is: Love is where you find it. The ending is no surprise at all but I won't spoil it for you. It's not a great movie nor is it a bad movie.",1217116800,2,2545,4.372093023255814

3105389,4,B0013F2ESM,"Spoilers warning and adult themed review to follow.

How can a sex comedy go wrong with such themes as turtle diarrhea, a lesbian power couple named Bambi and Thumper, a religious school bus group devirginization marathon, and/or knowing your sexual future? Or with script writing that includes a ""sloppy fusion of genitalia"", an ""intercourse buffet"" and a reference to that ""whore-bitch Jane Austen""? If you are not amused or are even offended right now - you might want to skip this movie (and review).

Daniel Waters has made a fun, original film about a man who is given the ""gift"" of knowing his future, specifically his upcoming sexual conquests, whether man or woman, all categorized on a nice list. Waters is oft remembered for his deviant writing with Heathers or Happy Campers, but in this case he gets to indulge a high volume of sexual perversions into one film.

The two leads were cast appropriately with a needed ""pretty boy"" in Simon Baker (I remember him most from his brief role in LA Confidential) and Winona Ryder playing the femme fatale/serial coma-inducer. A great supporting cast in Mindy Cohn, Julie Bowen (who I liked in the Ed TV series), the Janitor from Scrubs, Natasha Malthe, etc.

The film has two story lines, one involves the man who has it all that receives this list (origins of which can only be seen in the film to understand) containing all of his past and future sexual escapades. He gets this the week of his wedding - only to find out there are 60+ names listed after his soon to be wife. The other story is Winona's character resolving her past sufferings by inducing comas upon every man she sleeps with. The remaining twists and interlocking plots need to be watched as they can't be explained without spoiling too much. Which leads me to the extras...

The DVD docu titled ""101 Perversions"" is an excellent insight into the minds and motives behind this film - and for the first time on a disc docu - they actually disclaim the piece as containing spoilers and recommend that you watch the film first. Waters' interview gets some nice slams on present day big comedy films ""that suck"", but includes some nice homages to Benny Hill and Fellini for this film.

I think this is what my customers have been looking for in a ""good adult comedy"" that doesn't involve lowbrow humor or have National Lampoon in the title (the later NLs).",1214697600,18,2375,4.697115384615385

However, Simon Baker steals the show with his rather tongue-in-cheek performance. I can see how it would be easy to over-play his character but Baker holds back and let's us see him slowly unravel. For being a ""heart throb"" so to speak, Baker is a talented actor and its a joy to see him perform. I suppose he could be considered the thinking woman's sex-symbol.

3105435,2,B0013F2ESM,"The movie is pretty boring. It's about a 2 hour movie and it has a very simple plot. A man get's a list of women that he had sex with, but the list also has names of women he never had sex with...but will later. He then goes out and find them and has sex with them. There are very few good moments that is actually fun to watch and it just gets pretty boring all other times. Just seeing what other ways does the guy needs to do to find out who is going to have sex with the only thing this movie will show you.

Winona Ryder is sexy as ever and I just give it 2 stars for that. She dresses in all black outfit all the time because she is Death nail and what she does is goes around killing men she will sleep with.

Spolier Alert!

The guy is supposed to sleep with 101 women and at the last women he is supposed to die. Well the 101 woman turns out to be Ryder and she doesn't kill him and instead those to end up liking each other and get marry. They live happily ever after and it's the end. I didn't like it because it doesn't make much sense to me at the end. It feels a little cheesy and dumb. Those two sure be the last two to ever make it all work out and to be together at the end was even more stupid.

3105436,2,B0013F2ESM,"Don't worry, this review will be spoiler free, but let's start with the basic plot. Simon Baker plays Roderick Blank, engaged to be married when his life is turned upside down by an E-Mail with 101 names on it - the first 29 of them being the women in his life he's had sex with, with number 29 being his fianc and the remaining 72 being his future lovers. Running parallel to this story is Winona Ryder, playing ""Death Nell,"" a vixen going around seducing men and putting them into comas for reasons that will reveal themselves toward the end.

I'm not even sure what genre to peg this under. It's a dark comedy, but not really when you compare it films like Very Bad Things or Jawbreaker, because it's not nearly as vicious. It's also kind of a romantic comedy, but not really as well, because the plot focuses mainly on Simon Baker bedding dozens of women throughout the film. Then you have Matrix-esque scenes in a white room which try to ponder philosophical questions about sex, love and life. The film doesn't really pick a clear path and comes off as erratic and unmemorable.

This isn't to say the film doesn't have its moments, it does on occasion, but clocking in at 100 minutes, the film dragged and was wholly forgettable.

That didn't happen. The plot is about as ridiculous as one could possibly be but somehow Baker pulled it off with just the right amount of cartoonish immaturity and eventually adult behavior to make this really dumb story enjoyable. Even that necrophiliac scene! That takes some trully skillful acting! The story itself, when one thinks about it, is not all that bad. I liked the underlying feminist message So overall the writing was admirable. The extra, where the writer/director explains how the film was made, talking over the entire show as it moves along, was interesting and informative. I didn't understand the part where he said Baker cried real tears when he read the last page of James Joyce's ""Ulysses."" Sounded like Baker has real-life literary/poetic sensitivities. Well, whatever. I checked that part of Ulysses on the Internet. Hadn't read it before. It's totally unreadable! But maybe not to others.

Only one thing lurks 'Death Nell' (Winona Ryder) a mysterious femme fatale who becomes an urban folk hero targeting men guilty of sex crimes against women. Written and directed by Daniel Waters the writer of 'Heathers' I did expected more black comedy, more edge, more Winona, a fun look at fantasies too good to be true.",1274659200,,605,4.45945945945946
3105446,3,B0013F2ESM,"After seeing ""Heathers"" as a preteen (boy, that seems a long time ago) I made it my business to follow Dan Waters' career.  After a brilliant dark comedy like ""Heathers,"" you assumed he was going to continue to write screenplays equally as dark and caustic as that.  But it didn't quite work out that way.  Oddly enough, he became something of an action writer.  The material was still dark and funny, but always with a big-budget action edge (""Ford Fairlane,"" ""Hudson Hawk,"" ""Batman Returns,"" ""Demolition Man"").  He wrote other projects -- an insane summer-camp script called ""Happy Campers"" (best described by Dan's brother as ""the 'Apocalypse Now' of camp movies""), an amusing adaptation of ""A Stranger in a Strange Land"" and a blistering satire of the fashion industry by the name of ""A Model Daughter"" -- but many of them got stuck in development and never made.  He did eventually direct ""Happy Campers"" on his own, but it was a disastrous, low-budget mess.

""Sex and Death 101"" is certainly better than ""Happy Campers,"" but it's not nearly as good as his earlier work, and it doesn't feel worth the six-year wait.

""S&D101"" was just never all that funny to me.  It's amusing, and you knew Dan would be good for an insightful rant or two about relationships and sex, but I can't actually remember ever laughing.  That he dips into a disgusting bit of Farrelly-esque humor is just a little sad to me.

The premise is this: a man, about to get married, gets an E-mail with the names of every woman he's slept with and every woman he will eventually sleep with.  The list essentially ruins him, as he seeks to find each woman and speed the process along.  He becomes addicted to the list.

There's a parallel storyline about a female serial killer the press calls Death Nell, who preys on men who exploit or hurt women.

I think the flaw of this movie comes in its casting and its story structure.

Simon Baker is a good-looking guy, but boyishly so.  He has that innocuous smile that makes it hard to dislike him.  He's pretty, but not sexy.  He doesn't really look like the type of guy women would fall head over heels in lust with.  I also find his character a little confusing.  When we first meet him, he's about to get married to a domineering and aggressive woman.  If he has such a rotund libido to satisfy, why is he settling?  The story of the list becomes a chicken/egg thing for me.  It almost seems like getting the list causes the licentiousness (since he basically just walks into a bar, sees someone on the list, and the person falls for him like they're under a spell) than the other way around.

The most interesting thing about the movie is Death Nell.  With swollen red lips pushing out through hanging curtains of jet-black hair, Winona Ryder has never looked sexier.  It's really great to see her in this type of role again.  She's always had a bit of a mysterious edge to her.  She presents an almost casual air to her murders.

It turns out Nell (or Gillian De Raisx) was a wife abused by a bizarre husband who liked for her to dress up in different costumes and then beat her.  He accidentally dies one night and Gillian decides she needs to help the women of the world out by removing a few of the bad men.  (Waters and Ryder get in a great ""Heathers"" reference when Gillian furiously scrawls in her journal.)

As you probably know already, the final name on Roderick's list is Gillian De Raisx.  Will it be death or love that makes her the last?

Once Roderick decides to face his fate and go after Gillian, this movie really kicks into gear.  The problem is that it happens an hour too late.  I personally think the bulk of the movie -- as Roderick discovers and experiences the ups and downs of the list -- could have been accomplished in short order.  I would have much rather seen Gillian and Roderick connect, with her not knowing he's aware of who she is.  He would be in a position of not knowing if she's going to kill him at any moment.  And she would have to decide if she was really in love or if it wasn't just easier to kill a man than work through a relationship with him.  Waters actually had something similar to this -- playing with the idea that you never truly know your partner -- in his unproduced ""Catwoman"" script.

This movie probably has the funniest end line of all time, but otherwise it never really comes alive.  Dan Waters has always been better at showing the bad behavior of men through a woman's point of view.  Here we're in a man's and it feels a little immature and artificial.

Outside of Ryder's performance, I consider this film a letdown.",1262563200,,4608,4.492178098676294

In part of the film, Simon Baker's character is confronted with a woman who is just as creative, attractive and interesting as he is who is not certain whether or not she wants a platonic or romantic relationship with him. This section speaks to everyone: we have all had the one person in our life that we think would be perfect for us romantically --- but whom, because of timing, emotional confusion or lack of interest doesn't feel the same way. This film showcases the beauty and frustration of this sort of relationship from beginning to end in a dark, funny and heartbreaking way.

I can't tell you how many times I have watched a romantic comedy and the tension of unrequited love is resolved unrealistically when the reluctant or resistant girl or guy eventually being swept off his/her feet by a crazy public display of affection or some ridiculous plot twist. Truthfully, only ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""500 Days of Summer"" seem to get their unrequited love plots ""right.""

This is sometimes jaw dropping. You will find yourself bursting out laughing despite yourself.

3105452,4,B0013F2ESM,"""Sex and Death 101"" is a dark and savvy little romantic comedy that gleefully dances away from many of the stale and stuffy conventions generally associated with the genre.

Simon Baker stars as the allegorically named Roderick Blank, a handsome, seemingly insatiable lady killer who's decided it's finally time to put an end to his womanizing ways in favor of marriage to the beautiful Fiona Wormwood.  Yet, literally on the eve of his bachelor party, Rod receives a mysterious email listing in chronological order not only all the women he's already slept with throughout the course of his life but all the women he is destined to sleep with in the time that still remains to him (the total is 101, if you haven't already surmised that from the film's title).  Adhering to the adage ""the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak,"" Rod allows the list to essentially take over his life, waiting for the next promised woman to fall into his lap (sometimes quite literally), then crossing her name off the moment he`s had his way with her.  But is this truly the route to a satisfying life, even for a notorious playboy like Roderick Blank?

Part science fiction and part metaphysical morality play, ""Sex and Death 101"" also boasts two wacky subplots that run contrapuntal to the main story:  one featuring Winona Ryder as an avenging feminist who comes in the guise of a serial killer, luring unsuspecting misogynists to their well-deserved destruction; and the other involving  three mysterious figures (mad scientists, intervening angels?) who kidnap Rod to inform him that he has been the victim of some bizarre cosmic prank and that he needs to destroy the list before it destroys him.

""Sex and Death 101"" is not a perfect film by any means.  Its attempts at surrealism are frequently heavy-handed and strained, and its black-comedy edge isn`t always as razor-sharp as it could be.  But, on the whole, this is a wildly original and surprisingly incisive look at the different ways in which men and women view sex and romance and the different ways they use both those things to get what they want.  Writer/director Daniel Waters knows how to set even the most hackneyed romantic comedy clich spinning on its head.  For instance, the movie takes the obligatory ""gay best friend"" stereotype - who usually comes in the form of a flaming interior decorator or wedding planner - and turns it into a wise-cracking lesbian (smartly played by Mindy Cohn, best known as Natalie from ""The Facts of Life""), whose duties as Rod's personal secretary go far beyond merely scheduling his appointments or knowing where his briefcase is.

Although Rod is, in many ways, a typical character for a romantic comedy - afraid of commitment, obsessed with nailing every woman who comes his way, etc. - the route the script takes to get him to his admittedly rather predictable pro-woman/pro-romance epiphany is anything but typical.  This freshness is further enhanced by the devilishly playful and utterly disarming performance turned in by Baker who completely captivates the viewer with his easygoing charisma and charm.  The scene in which Baker and Ryder finally share screen time together is exceptionally well acted and staged.

Even though the movie feels a little disjointed and unfocused at times, Waters does a nice job dovetailing all the seemingly unrelated plot elements into a satisfying whole in the end.

3105456,4,B0013F2ESM,"""Sex and Death 101"" sounds like the name of a college course, and indeed, it could work well as a study companion for critical theory classes, specifically those covering the Fate versus Free Will debate. I'm reminded of ""The Golden Compass,"" a wonderful fantasy film about keeping free will on a short leash; there are those who oppose it, which by default suggests that it exists. ""Sex and Death 101,"" a fascinating dark comedy about a man and a list of names, seems to take the exact opposite approach. Fate determines what will happen to us, not free will. Writer/director Daniel Waters regards this idea with a tragic sense of awe, and this is despite the fact that (1) the film is often times very funny, and (2) that it ends on a very satisfying note. It could be that, even if we're made to live the happiest of lives, there's no comfort in knowing that we have absolutely no control over what we say or do.

This movie tells the story of Roderick Blank (Simon Baker), a thirty-something executive for a successful fast food chain called Swallows. He has everything a man could want: a great job, a great fiance named Fiona (Julie Bowen), and great friends. After marrying Fiona, he would like nothing more than to settle down and have a family. One day, his office computer receives an anonymous e-mail containing the names of 101 women. When his assistant, Trixie (Mindy Cohn), reads off the first few names, he thinks that it's a list of the women he slept with before meeting Fiona. It stands to reason that her name would be at the bottom. Unfortunately, it isn't; she's only number twenty-nine. Roderick briefly considers the idea that it's all a practical joke, or maybe someone is reminding him of what he'll be giving up in order to marry Fiona. Then he actually meets one of the other listed women, and lo and behold, they somehow or another end up having sex. This list knows all.

Initially, Roderick believes he's hit a stroke of good luck. But as he crosses names off of the list, he begins to wonder if the thrill of the hunt is more enticing than the catch. Within no time at all, sex has become chore. Some of his flings are entriely accidental, and this definitely includes the leprosy-stricken grandmother of a sexy centerfold. Some are just plain bizarre: Who would have thought he had a chance with a power lesbian couple, who also happen to be reality TV stars? At a certain point, Roderick begins dating a quirky but loveable veterinarian named Miranda Storm (Leslie Bibb), and for the first time since losing Fiona, he believes he's found the one woman he can settle down with. But does she feel the same way about him? And what about the fact that there are more names on the list? What about fate?

Intertwined with this story is a feminist vigilante known as Death Nell (Winona Ryder), who's striking fear into the hearts of men. Her trademark: Putting sex criminals and misogynists into permanent comas after seducing them. Her real name is Gillian de Raisx, a reference to Gilles de Rais, a fifteenth century French nobleman who was tried and executed for murdering dozens, if not hundreds, of children. One wonders why Waters named his femme fatale after such a horrible man; Gillian has legitimate reasons for doing what she does, which is probably why a number of feminist organizations consider her a hero. ""Did they really catch that satanic succubus?"" asks one of Roderick's obnoxious friends. ""No,"" Trixie responds, ""and the word is `freedom fighter.'"" What exactly does this have to do with Roderick? As it turns out, Gillian is the 101st name on the list.

Keeping tabs on both Gillian and Roderick is a mysterious organization. That's about as specific as I can get, which doesn't mean that I'm intentionally keeping a secret from you; it means that virtually nothing about it is explained. There are only two things we know for sure. First, within a mysterious white room sits a special computer that relies on quantum mechanics to predict the future, the same computer that e-mailed the list to Roderick. Second, gray-suited men named Alpha (Robert Wisdom), Beta (Tanc Sade), and Fred (Patton Oswald) are apparently the only three people running the organization. These characters work in and of themselves. Alpha was even given one of the film's most telling lines during a scene with Roderick: ""Horoscopes, psychics, tarot cards, coming attractions that give away the whole movie--why must you people know everything?"" But the entire concept of the computer and the organization utilizing it is just plain maddening.

Then again, that could have been the intention all along, and I have to admit that I enjoyed every scene featuring the gray-suited men. We may not know who they are, but at least their dialogue is interesting. And their cryptic observations on fate keep the audience alert. Keep in mind that the very idea of fate will always raise certain questions. Here's the most famous one: Would you want to know the exact date, time, and location of your death if given the opportunity? I think the message ""Sex and Death 101"" is sending is that, because you can't change fate, there's no point in knowing ahead of time what will happen. This is a strange but deeply thought-provoking film, often hilarious, often irreverent, and even at its most outrageous, it's always compelling.",1227225600,2,5341,4.788503253796096

And, with 101 names on the list and his fiancee coming in at number 29, it doesn't look good for the health of the upcoming marriage.

Doesn't matter anyway, as the engagement is soon broken off. Intrigued by the possibilities, Rod proceeds to go down the list and thru women after women. Meanwhile, the media has been going on and on about the enigmatic serial killer nicknamed Death Nell, a seductress who beds jerks and then puts them in comas. And what are the odds that she's on Rod's weird list? Hint: odds are pretty good.

Witty and thought-provoking, sexy and hilarious. These are words which do not apply to this movie. Going into SEX AND DEATH 101, I was pretty stoked at the premise and anticipating all the good stuff that writer/director Daniel Waters had in store (after all, dude wrote the awesomely subversive film classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers-20th-High-School-Reunion-Edition/dp/B00180OU4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers - 20th High School Reunion Edition</a>). But afterwards saw me feeling bummed and so bored and tired and pretty mad. SEX AND DEATH 101 is, I guess, a sex farce which you might, just might enjoy if you're fratting it out with the homies. Otherwise, it just doesn't generate that feeling of ""Oboy, am I glad I tuned in to this!"" Supposedly a dark comedy, the comedy is dang vapid and can only be considered ""dark"" by people who insist that CHARLES IN CHARGE was controversial. The characters are sluggish and unengaging (with, strangely enough, Winona Ryder's murderous femme fatale being the most sympathetic). And there's an air of smugness about the whole thing, almost as if Daniel Waters is actually proud of this project.

I am a manly dude with some hair on his chest, and this is a movie blessed with stunning women... but it left me cold. Of course, most of the ladies are there simply to be grinded thru the movie plot machine, so that names could start getting crossed off Rod's magic list. Three women do get smidgens of depth: Julie Bowen (of the much lamented television show ED), Leslie Bibb (of the much lamented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popular-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0001I55S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popular - The Complete First Season</a>), and Winona Ryder (just much lamented). The rest of the ladies come off as sexy cardboard cutouts. So, yeah, it turns out, even with so many gorgeous women on screen, it's still quite easy to become jaded. It's almost like porno, but without the interesting music.

Simon Baker. He's the biggest reason I couldn't get into SOMETHING NEW, a romantic dramedy which stars one of my favorites, Sanaa Lathan. Simon Baker is tall and handsome and self-satisfied; he's your basic non-threatening looking male. He's also bland to the bone, a quality which attracts women with insomnia and women who knit for adventure. Needless to say, I did not like him in SEX AND DEATH 101. Is it too cold to use the word ""languid"" when describing a guy?

A quick segue: Does the mysterious e-mail ever get explained? Well, there's a subplot involving a super computer and three guys gigged out in white. It smacks vaguely of something supernatural.

Okay, back to my quibbling.

You ever get mad at having wasted your time watching a stinky movie? If I had a dog, I would've kicked it.

Trying to be nice, I came up with about four positives about the film. One: Winona Ryder. Two: surprisingly, it has an aw-shucks feel-good ending. Three: for the dudes, ample female nudity. And four: it's nice to see that Mindy Cohn (FACTS OF LIFE) is still among the living. I was wondering.

The movie does delve a bit into existential angst, so for people looking for some depth, that was it. Me, I'm still mad, and now I'm eyeing my neighbor's dog.",1224028800,2,4043,5.113636363636363

Of course when he runs into a serial killer with the moniker of Death Nell you'd think he'd rethink his strategy.

I really didn't care for this movie and probably would have turned it off about half way through but I like the lead actor, Simon Baker. He just seems horribly miscast and unbelievable. The film oftens veers off into sophomoric humor, which normally I like, but it didn't even do base comedy well.

And the movie goes on to to show how he just has to say the word or make the look and ladies tumble into bed with him.

Until the snag comes. The last name on the list sleeps with Rod way before her time on the list.

What does this all mean? Is it death--or marriage?

The movie was somewhat interesting, although sophomoric. The movie found it difficult to be serious (with a message about relationshis) or campy. It tends to lean toward campy.

The movie follows the misadventures of a man who one day is mysteriously emailed a list of all the women he is going to sleep with within his lifetime.  But the biggest catch is that the last name on the list is a serial killer. The film is produced on a tight budget but being a situational commentary not much is lost in the process.  Although the film does run a little long at 117 minutes.

Both Simon Baker and Winona Ryder put forth pretty good acting jobs.  After all the problem's Ryder has had the last couple of years, its good to finally see her back in movies.

To be fair its obvious the script is taking biting stabs at male chauvanists and the like, it just has such a good time wallowing in its shallow excesses (the babes, gratuitous sex scenes) that its hard to listen.  The complex set of side characters and subplots that intertwine with the main storyline frankly don't, this feels like two seperate movies for a good chunk of the running time and thats not right.  To its credit SEX AND DEATH 101 is fairly unpredicatable in its contrivances and offers a few genuinely objectionable laughs but it would have been better served as a more complex look at one man's psyche, instead of the pastiche of viewpoints it serves.",1221696000,,1013,4.771428571428571

Would this information change the way he lives his life. Others were given the time of their death by the same computer glitch that gave Blank his list.

The film is not bad as a whole and Waters has some good lines unfortunately the film veers a little too much into the teen sex comedy arena for my tastes. The acting is a little bland even though it was good to see Wynona Ryder as Death Nell. The movie has the potential to become a cult classic like Waters earlier fil Heathers if it manages to find its audience.

3105466,4,B0013F2ESM,"I have to say, this movie directed and written by Daniel Waters (creator of Heathers) was pretty engaging. I started watching it, thinking it was gonna be crap and to my surprise it was actually not only watchable but hilarious at times. The movie revolves around Roderick Blank (Simon Baker), a soon to be married man who receives a mysterious email that lists all of the women that he has slept with and WILL sleep with. Naturally, the rewards of possessing such a list prove to be too tempting to Roderick and he decides to forego the marriage and do a little exploring, so to speak. He soon comes to find out that a list like that isn't as great as he thinks it might've been and realizes that there's way more to it all than he might've thought or understood. It's all a bit ridiculous and some situations require total suspension of disbelief but the film has something to say and in the end, it was actually touching and insightful. I found it pretty funny and worth a look, at the very least. The cast was hilarious, especially Facts of Life alum Mindy Cohn and Patton Oswalt who is in the film solely to speak ridiculousness it seems. I'd definitely recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a little darkness in their comedies.

The DVD is presented well and looks and sounds great.

However, when it starts to turn him into a sex addict, Roderick attempts to take control and is soon thrown a heartbreaking curve ball that sends him to a very dark place. A lifetime of dating and sex in a single year takes Roderick on a physical, mental, and emotional rollercoaster ride as he is forced to grow from his experiences and ultimately elude one most dangerous temptress who could be his last shot at whatever it is he is trying to find or figure out.

A thoughtful, dark, very adult comedy/drama with slightly noticeable but fully essential sci-fi elements from the writer and director of the '80's cult-classic ""Heathers"", Daniel Waters, ""Sex and Death 101"" is very much a film about sex (though the dialogue is more graphic than the visuals, in my opinion anyway) and not for the prude audience member. It observes one supposedly average man (hmm...) in a process of learning to be a worthy counterpart to... whoever he ends up with, if anyone. The film is a great piece of entertainment, as it has a fine cast and never really gets boring (though maybe pushes it now and then; after all, it has a repeating plot point: meeting women and engaging in sex with them), though it intends to be rather thoughtful/inspirational I think, and in that regard I think it will only work for a section of its audience. Most of the film's introspective qualities are aimed at the serial dater, one-night stand aficionado, sex addict, whatever, but, of course, come from the Hollywoodland mindset, where people seem to think everyone falls into that category (and the public sadly buys into it). There's this long-standing idea around that all normal males spend their first 30 to... whenever they get married years attempting to mount anything that moves, and it's widely believed because, A. People who ARE that way like to say everyone is that way, and B. It's the way women think all men are (but that's just because those are the only kind of men they'll date). So, if you are one of the rare breed who doesn't buy that every guy lives his life on a quest to cut as many notches into his bedpost as possible, or that everyone in real life has engaged in meaningless fast-food sex at one time in their life or other, this one will probably stop at ""entertainment value"" for you. Luckily, it succeeds in that arena enough that it should work for anyone.

The film's cast is one of its best qualities, and Simon Baker, whom I know best from George A. Romero's ""Land of the Dead"", a great film, is truly the star here as charmingly screwed-up Roderick Blank, but there is a fine roster of leading ladies too, the most memorable being the beautiful Leslie Bibb, who gives Roderick his first experience with ""the friend zone"" (Leslie reminds me of Tuesday Weld as Thalia Menninger here, she even looks like her; but I must say that the constantly pushed by the media and this character idea of a plutonic male/female friendship is entirely idealistic and impossible, a pure female fantasy, and that doesn't mean it's always about sex either), not to mention Winona Ryder, whose path doesn't even cross with the star's until close to the end of the picture. The gorgeous Amanda Walsh makes an appearance in the film that I feel like mentioning too (she's so cute, has the face of TinkerBell), but unfortunately isn't even onscreen for a full minute. I'll also throw in a mention of Patton Oswalt, who you'll possibly recognize as the voice of Remy in ""Ratatouille"". He has a small recurring part in the film as some great comic relief playing one of the guys tied in with the source of ""the list"", but I don't want to give too much away about that.

The writer/director of the film, Daniel Waters, is most closely associated here with the movie ""Heathers"". For the record, and I'm sure few will agree with me, despite the fact that I don't agree with him in all of his ideas presented in this movie (no doubt, most people probably WOULD agree with him on them rather than with me), I think ""Sex and Death 101"" is the better film. I used to enjoy ""Heathers"" back in the day, though the target audience was more my older sister's generation, but when I revisited the film sometime last year, I found it to be rather dated and unfunny. I don't think this one will seem so dated. ""Sex and Death 101"" is a fascinating ride. I disagree that people in general are as lascivious as Hollywood tends to present them (not that they don't pretend to be, and not that most folks in Hollywood aren't that way), I don't buy that as many people as film and TV tells us are having sex whenever they take a notion to, wherever they happen to be, with whomever they see that's halfway attractive (though probably more are nowadays since they've been seeing it on TV the past 30 years), but it's still fun to watch what one guy did when he came across a very strange list. The movie was full of surprises and had a good cast, and that kept it interesting. It's well worth checking out at least once if movies about sex don't scare you away. The DVD provides the trailer, a behind the scenes featurette, and a very informative director commentary (which teases us by talking about deleted scenes at one point that didn't actually make it into the extras in the end). If you're a fan of any of the actors in Sex and Death 101, you'll probably want to pick it up, though the only one who is truly in it from beginning to end is Simon Baker (well, and The Facts of Life's Mindy Cohn as his assistant, Trixie).

We never fully understand how or why this is happening, but it puts the movie into one big set up for crude joke after crude joke of how our lead gets hooked up with all the girls on his list.  It features some very funny scenarios, while many more end up rather awkward and flat.

The best moments in the film are when our main character settles in to the 101st name on the list, Winona Ryder, a near-serial killer of sorts.  I say near serial killer, as she merely drugs her victims and puts them into comas.  These scenes feature a glimpse of how good the movie could have been, if the first 75% of the film was simply rewritten.

3105472,1,B0013F2ESM,"Watching a direct-to-DVD movie is gamble, but once in awhile you hit upon a surprisingly good one. More often, unfortunately, you get stuck with a real turkey.

And then there are movies like ""Sex and Death 101"" - a movie that is such a terminal bore that you wind up feeling like a fool for wasting time on it. The dialogue rings so false - it sounds as if it was written all for one character. In other words, all of these characters speak in the same pseudo-witty way that they all blend together.

Let me start off by saying, even if you are a Winona Ryder fan you might want to skip this one. She's barely in it! Her name and likeness are featured prominently on the DVD cover, but it borderlines on false advertising. To make matters worse, she is the only real movie star in this pitiful trash. Comedian Patton Oswald is maybe the second most notable performer, and his fans are sure to be disappointed as well in the way he is wasted in a small and largely unnecessary role. The acting is hideously subpar all around, especially the unrelentingly smug Simon Baker in the starring role.

The movie takes forever (okay, maybe not literally - but it takes about half the running time) to set up the premise. And once it does, I couldn't make sense of it. Simon Baker's character is presented with an e-mail that lists all the people he's had sex with and goes on to list all the people he will have sex with in the future. This ends up changing his marriage plans, as he frolics around from woman to woman. And Winona Ryder plays someone known as 'Death Nell' - a seductress who's companions always wind up dead.

If any of that sounds intriguing, I implore you to reconsider.

While many people received an e-mail revealing their death-day, Roderick Blank was ""gifted"" with a list of every woman he has and WILL sleep with. Sounds great, right? Well, what the viewer learns is that ""the chase"" is fairly boring when the results are a given. Watching Rodrick try to plow through his list is dark and hysterical (especially when we reach Bambi and Thumper ... a world-class, lesbian power-couple).

With a budget of five-million, Waters created a pretty slick film. The casting is quirky (in a fantastic way!!).

I'm entirely biased here (since I think Oswalt is one of the most adorable, underrated actors in Hollywood), but his character alone makes the film worth watching. Moreover, Mindy Cohn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Facts-of-Life/dp/B000EQ45BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Facts of Life</a>) was a brave and fabulous choice. All grown up, Cohn rocks her character. She adds sweetness to (what could have been) your typical ""lesbian"" character. Kudos!! Julie Bowen, Winona Ryder, and Simon Baker nicely round-out the cast. Overall, the acting is wonderfully on-point. We could genuinely loathe the character of Roderick BUT Baker brings an irrefutable charm to him. And, this is where the film is a success. Roderick may be a slick, handsome, fast-food King (""Have a startling and unique day!!""), but as he resigns himself to fate he becomes brooding and vulnerable. Love it.

Why should you watch this work? One: it has a montage of lower-back, Chinese-symbol tattoos to represent the passage of time (a great joke resides in this moment ... pay attention). Two: watching Roderick don faerie-wings just to join Bambi and Thumper (in slow-motion) ... TOTALLY WORTH IT! (And so funny). Three: the scene with the school bus ... that's all I can say (by far, the absolutely most unpredictable, wildly amusing moment).

I noticed that this work is receiving some seriously scathing reviews. As a harsh-critic, I respect the opinions of others.

3105474,3,B0013F2ESM,"This film has more charm and fun than it has been given credit for but don't expect it to appear on AFI's next list of 100 best comedies.  ""Sex and Death 101"" stars Simon Baker as Roderick Blank, a successful fast food entrepreneur and randy ""ladies man"" who has decided to get married to escape the rat race and embrace the committed life of his married friends.

However, a mysterious computer/Oracle sends him an email with a list of every woman he has ever had sex with or ever will have sex with, in chronological order.  Baker realizes that if the list is accurate, and it seems to be, he will have sex with many more women after his marriage so he cancels the marriage he didn't really want.  Instead, he becomes obsessed with the list and contrives ways to meet each name on the list with the growing certainty that sex will result.

This is an innovative premise for a movie and certainly explores some provocative ideas.  If presented with such a list and the knowledge that it was accurate, what would you do if you knew you had ""carte blanche"" for ""sure things?""  How rapidly would you approach exhausting the names on the list if you knew it was chronologically there for the taking?  Would you be apprehensive about  what happens after the last name on your list was ""crossed off?""  Does sex and intimacy ultimately have personal meaning if there is never doubt or challenge involved?  And the ultimate question, who is in charge--the list (or machine which created it) or the protagonist?

Such an intriguing set up is never quite maximized as it could have been.  Unfortunately, the movie's tone shifts at times from comedy to fantasy to serious to philosophical resulting in an uneven ride for the viewer.  Baker's obsession leads him from a spirit of wonder to arrogance and predictably to boredom.  Some of his assignations with women will make you smile but mostly they are there to be endured as Baker begins an inner soul searching as to what love and intimacy should really be.

A concurrent story line presents Winona Ryder as a dangerously alluring femme fatale, Death Nell, who has sexual meetings with men who have committed sex crimes against women and , Black Widow-like, leaves them in a drug induced coma while spray painting graffiti and poetry on their walls.  Ryder and Baker have a number of instances where they just miss crossing paths as she leaves one victim and he leaves one of his ""conquests""--we just know these two star-crossed protagonists are bound to meet sooner or later.

The subplot of three mysterious men in gray suits locked in a white room with the giant machine/computer/oracle that spits out the fate of mortals and who project an all-seeing, all-knowing glibness to Baker is never fully realized.  Also, I felt the casting was off in a few cases--most notably with Baker's assistant.  Several key changes in the cast utilizing some more appropriate comedic talent might have changed the overall appeal of this film because the plot was innovative enough to succeed more than it does.

The film has some funny and some poignant scenes, just not enough of them.  I liked the scenes of Baker's awkwardness with his buddies'wives at group outings that are counterbalanced by his buddies when they are alone with him.  It is a clever story that does not reach it potential yet can be recommended as a fun and charming movie if the viewer has realistic expectations.",1217462400,3,3417,4.744500846023689
3105475,1,B0013F2ESM,"At 2 hours long, this film dragged and dragged.  I was watching the clock thinking, I can't believe it's less than halfway through ... can't believe there's still 45 minutes to go ... can't believe another 25 minutes left.

A man (Simon Baker) is sent a list of all the women he will have sex with in his life, while a woman (Winona Ryder) goes around putting men into comas.  In the end, they meet.

Along the way, Baker learns ""lessons about life.""  Supposedly.

Oh yeah, there's also a MATRIX parody somewhere in there, with a wise, bald black guy, with a deep baritone voice, lecturing to Baker as though he were Neo.

HEATHERS writer Daniel Waters reteamed with HEATHERS star Winona Ryder to make this film. Like other reviewers, I loved HEATHERS (and most of Ryder's pre-2001 work).  Maybe that's the problem.

SEX AND DEATH 101 feels like Waters wanted to recreate his past success by writing (and now, also directing) a supposedly ""dark comedy"" starring Winona Ryder.

Sounds like a ""deal memo"" film, i.e., some agent listed the ""creative elements"" in a memo -- Waters, Ryder, sex, black comedy, boffo! -- then gave it to a studio executive.  This film must have looked good on paper.

In the special features, Waters says he wanted to create ""a serious film about sex,"" but it's formulaic.  Worse, it's a mish-mash of conflicting formulas.

Problems:

* Film is too self-conscious.  It's trying too hard to be a ""black comedy,"" because it's aware that HEATHERS was a black comedy.  It feels like the characters die in flippant ways, not because it was necessary for the story, but because it worked in HEATHERS.  Yet this film is not darkly humorous. It's just flippant and shallow.

* Despite its flippancy, this film also tries to be ""deep.""  There's much voice-over by Baker, who informs us of his Deep Thoughts about love and sex and the meaning of life, etc.  But his Deep Thoughts are as insightful and unique as the Deep Thoughts on Saturday Night Live.  (But not funny.  Not even unintentionally funny.)

* Thus, SEX AND DEATH 101 doesn't know whether to be flippant and oh-so-hip, or deep and sincere, or funny, or what.  It's all over the map -- and what is it with that MATRIX black guy?

Ryder has a small role in this film; she's not on screen much.  About 20 minutes out of 2 hours.  Well, it's Baker's film.

Ryder is good, but she hasn't been in a great film in nearly a decade.  Not her fault.",1217462400,5,2419,4.58411214953271
3105476,2,B0013F2ESM,"Yes, folks, it's true.  Natalie from ""The Facts of Life"" has grown up to be a foul-mouthed lesbian in the film, ""Sex and Death 101"" (which I believe made a quick exit from movie theaters when it was released earlier this year). Actress Mindy Cohn does have a few amusing lines in the film (""I'm hoping for an autograph--or a three-way"", which sounds a lot funnier coming out of her mouth).  She plays the lead character's secretary, Trixie, who helps her boss deal with a mysterious email list of all the names of everyone he's had sex with and ever will have sex with in the future.  It's a bizarre concept that makes for a confusing, boring and LONG (it's 117 minutes) ""comedy"".

The lead character, Roderick Blank, is played by actor Simon Baker, who is a blank when it comes to comedy.  The guy just ain't funny, no matter how hard he tries--but I will put most of the blame on the writing of his dull character by writer/director Daniel Waters.  However, Mr. Baker is an attractive man with a dazzling smile and nice pecs (which he reveals in a few shirtless scenes).

As for Winona Ryder, who receives second billing, she's sadly wasted in an underwritten role.  The actress barely appears in the first 90 minutes of the film! And her character, Death Nell (yes, that is her name), is a crazy femme fatale who puts men into comas.  Her storyline doesn't have much to do with the rest of the movie until the very end.  I won't spoil the ""fun"", but I found the ending of the film to be totally unbelievable.  It's such a shame about Ryder's disappointing role because she can really act when given a good script (i.e. ""Heathers"" or one of my favorites, ""Mermaids"").  If you're thinking of buying/renting ""Sex and Death 101"" because you're a Winona fan, don't.  You've been warned.

Director/writer Daniel Waters wrote ""Heathers""--but he also wrote ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" and ""Hudson Hawk"", which is the group that I would stick ""Sex and Death 101"" in.  I'm being very generous by giving the film 2 stars, but Mindy Cohn deserves one of the stars for stealing every scene she's in--and it was just so nice to see ""Natalie"" again.  The other star goes to Mr. Baker's smile and pecs, which are very pleasant to view.  There's also some female nudity for those of you who enjoy that kind of thing.  Unfortunately, there are very few laughs to be found.

The premise makes no sense and the scenes -- I started to say ""story"" -- unfolds with a self-indulgent pretentiousness that is jawdropping.

Don't misunderstand me.  This isn't a movie that's so bad it's good.  It's not a cult film that can be discovered and enjoyed for its daring but failed artistry or something subversive aimed at narrow genre audience.  No, this is a horribly misguided affair from frame one.  And it just drags on and on and on.  I spent 117 minutes with this dreadfully repulsive and offensive digital disc and am only spending a few more minutes writing this as a warning to others.  Life is precious.  Don't waste it on bad movies.

What would be really interesting is a documentary on the making of this film.  Identifying the people responsible besides writer/director Daniel Waters.

I love this movie.  It is deep, and dark, and complex.  There are lots of homages, lots of funny lines, and lots of very stylistic scenes.  It is definitely a movie that takes multiple views to really appreciate.  The movie has an adult looking title, but the sex and the nudity are all pretty subdued by modern standards.  There is lots of magic in the dialog, the sets, and the hidden meanings.",1217289600,,623,4.412280701754386
3339877,3,B0013F2ESM,"Wynona Ryder teaming up with the writer who did Heathers is a cool proposition. Well if it were 1992. But re-teaming two decades after introducing the concept of a dark comedy upon teenagers doesn't have the same cachet had it not taken so long. The result of the eighteen year wait is Sex and Death 101, which, despite the title, is a much lighter affair than their first outing as it focuses much more on the former.

The sex part of the equation comes courtesy of Simon Baker (Red Planet) who receives a list of everyone he has had slept with a week before his wedding. The problem is that his fiance, Carol Vessey (Happy Gilmore), is only number twenty-nine of one hundred and one starting off a debate of destiny and free will and who knowing the names of every girl you going to sleep with, even if it is a lot, a good thing or bad thing. And then there is the flip side knowing when you don't have a chance.

Some hilarity ensues as Barker transverses his new found list which has him running into some girls on and off his list including a centerfold (Sophie Monk, Date Movie), a doctor (Leslie Bibb, Popular), someone who provides the Death part of the title (Wynona Ryder, Heathers), lesbians, and though not Pat's on the list, there is a Terry. Where the hilarity really excels is when Patton Oswalt (The King of Queens) hits the screen, though telling you his role is a little spoilerish.

Though being spoilerish with this film is hard because it is easy to tell the ending within the first five minutes of the film and nothing happens between then and the end (a too long two hours) that even gets you off the scent of how the story ends up. Luckily the journey there was half way decent if not in part to some of Oswalt's suggestions on getting around the list. Oh and did I mention Mindy Cohn, yes that Mindy Cohn, makes an appearance?",1217289600,,1851,4.406432748538012
3339878,4,B0013F2ESM,"What would you do if you know what would happen in your lifetime? Would you try to change your decisions, avoid the displeasing parts or meet everything head on? Well, writer/director Daniel Waters (Heathers, 1989) attempts to answer this question. What results is a satire of somewhat dark elements, oddly clever and maybe also be considered a horror flick in a certain way. ""SEX and DEATH 101"" is a sex comedy that is refreshing since it leaves the usual stereotypical elements of over-sexed teenagers and delves into the sex life of a guy over 30 (or 35?).

Roderick Blank (Simon Baker) is guy who seemingly has it all; he's about to get married, has a great job as an executive in a fast food franchise called ""Swallows"" and has a lot of friends. His entire life is turned upside down when he receives a mysterious e-mail that lists all the woman he has and will ever sleep with; PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE. 101 names to be exact, and the funny thing is, his bride to be is only number 29. What's a guy to do?
Meanwhile, an enigmatic femme fatale called ""Death Nell"" (Winona Ryder) has become an urban folk hero because she targets those men who have committed violence against women.

""Sex and Love 101"" is a dark comedy that somewhat reinforces the male anxiety. To settle down or to stay a bachelor forever? There are certain advantages and disadvantages, of course, and the character of Roderick Blank explores the why, the how and the when questions. I rather thought there were three acts in the film; Knowledge becomes power and power corrupts absolutely, the pursuit of an unreachable goal and the fear of your inevitable destiny. Personally, if I do come across such a list, I would probably be a little frightened but at the same time very curious. There is nothing like knowing exactly what your future holds, don't it? Yes and no.

Roderick Blank goes through his list and the film results in showing quite a bit of nudity. From a stripper, a centerfold named Cynthia Rose (Sophia Monk), a busload of beautiful virgins, to ultra-hotties: Bambi (Natassia Malthe) and Thumper (Pollyanna McIntosh), from a homeless woman to a leper, Blank goes through his list and the greatest relief from all of this is the fact he won't die until he has slept with each and every woman on the list. For the first half of the film, once you see a female character, you know that she'll be around for the next 5-15 minutes and she'll probably play a turning point in Blank's life. Miranda (Leslie Bibb) also represents the woman that Blank considers a pursuit and conquest---the one who put him in the ""friend zone"" and she isn't in his list. This element actually represented the idea that one can change his destiny. Well, Blank even considered necrophilia and castration just to offset the inevitable. The proceedings do have a `dark' humorous side as Blank considers his options and does contain some hinted amount of surprises.

Now just how did this list come from? Actually, the answer may be simpler than you may expect and well, it`s a bit hazy.  Three men called Alpha (Robert Wisdom), Beta (Tanc Sade) and ""Fred"" (Patton Oswalt) are the guardians of an enigmatic group.  Alpha is the intelligence, Beta is the deduction and Fred, well, he's the wild idea. You won't be far off in comparing this trio to the three ""Norns"" of fate in Norse Mythology and the these mystical beings of destiny are even present in Greek myth; who foresee the fates of both Gods and Men. Only instead of being women, this trio is made out of men. Fred is the one who feeds Blank with all the crazy ideas that he is about to have a lot of sex. Alpha well, he puts everything into play in a manner of speaking, he manipulates Blank into making his own direction.

For someone destined to have a lot of women in his lifetime, the actor has to be real smooth and devilishly handsome. I'm no judge to the male attributes but I thought that Simon Baker was convincing enough to pull it off. The film does have a clever script so whatever requires a large suspension of disbelief can be bought into, even though his acting may seem a little mechanical quite often. The supporting cast is led by Mindy Cohn (who plays Simon's confidant Trixie) adds a lot of depth and charm to the film's screenplay whenever she says ""I'm so glad I'm a lesbian"". Blank's interactions are competent enough that it does assist the film in its ""non-sex"" moments and rather fleshes out more of Simon's character. Why the heck does he have the last name ""Blank"" anyway? Winona Ryder may have limited screen time but her role is very significant. She plays the woman who has been abused and who finally realized that she is her own ""Prince Charming"". I do believe her character of ""Death Nell"" is a social metaphor or maybe for feminism. Winona is charming in her portrayal, well, in an imbalanced sort of way.

The direction was competent enough to keep me interested for its entirety. I was entertained but not really to the point of giving praise. The film clocks in at almost two hours, and for a movie like this, it may seem somewhat overlong and slow-paced. However, the film did attempt to fully flesh out the lead character, although, the plot itself had very little to work with. It took me a bit longer to warm up to Simon Baker but I did find the film to be a satisfying enough diversion. It's a welcome departure from the stereotypical sex comedies.

SEX and DEATH 101 is worthwhile effort, it's sexy, funny and twisted in its own way; and yep, there`s lot of skin in this movie. There were moments that were downright hilarious that I rather forgave its perfunctory climax and I thought it`s a charming piece of comedy. Sometimes it's better not to know and just go along for the ride of life.

3339879,2,B0013F2ESM,"Hmmmmm.  There's a lot to like about this movie.  Unfortunately there's more not to like.  The movie succeeded in making me want to think, but the more I found myself thinking the less I liked: (a) the characters; (b) the premise; and (c) the slickness the tale was bathed in.

The premise: Roderick (""Rod""), a wealthy, handsome young man with ""it all"" and about to be married, receives a list of 101 names comprising everyone he has had and ever will have sex with.  He falters, causing his fiancee to bail (this happens early and you'll see it coming - no spoiler here), but what ensues is the ridiculous notion that he must sleep with every woman on the list in breathtaking succession.  Gaining in his momentum of popularity, Simon Baker does what he can with Roderick, but the character alternates between slick annoyance and mildly pitiable.

His friends worship him, women can't resist him, and his Trixie, his ever gleeful, lesbian secretary, (Mindy Cohen of ""Facts of Life"" fame) tries to steer him on the right track - but he's having none of it.

The plot involves three mysterious men in a bare white room letting Rod in on some of the secrets of the universe and a sexual predator named ""Death Nell"" (Winona Rider in a wig and costume parade) who lures men to their demise.

The ending leaves more questions and holes and by the end the film's two hours felt like I'd just sat through Wagner's Ring cycle, with fewer jokes.

I actually got the deeper meaning part of it - although, it wasn't all THAT deep - but I don't remember laughing more than once or twice when I watched it.  Maybe I was in the wrong mood, or maybe I should have had a couple of drinks before watching it, but it was seriously not funny.  It lacked both the low-brow ""humour"" that's so prevalent these days in most comedies and the intelligent humour of writers like Joss Whedon and Bryan Fuller.  That's not to say the movie was a complete waste of time.  I did enjoy seeing the story unfold and I liked the interaction of the characters.

3339881,2,B0013F2ESM,"I remember loving it when I first saw it on video, even through its absurd moments... but, when I go back to it now, I'm left sort of ambivalent. And that's sort of the same feeling I get with Sex and Death 101, another of Danny Waters'.

The basic setup is that Roderick Blank has just been sent a list... a list with every woman he's ever slept with and every woman he ever WILL sleep with. His fianc is number 29... on a list of 101.

The various players are believable in their roles. Baker swaggers through Blank's sexcapades with the all too familiar arrogant smirk we've seen before on many a ladies' man, Ryder puts on Slater's shoes this go-round as the serial killer to be (though she never actually seems to kill anyone), and Patton Oswalt has some seriously cringe-worthy, though funny, one-liners that are quickly eating up his family-friendly cred garnered from lending his voice to Remy of Pixar's Ratatouille.

Then there's the veritable cornucopia of beautiful women laid before the very (un)lucky Mr. Blank. Mmmmm. Where was I?

S&D101 is a mediocre movie.

It's sexy, scandalous, and sometimes thoughtful, but suffers in practice. Problems mostly arise from just how much Danny wants us to take in. We're almost never on board with Blank as he breezes through women, even when the list puts him in bed with some seriously disturbing women and situations. Blank's narration is often there to spin things, but also betrays us several times for the sake of Danny's message. Wynona's `Death Nell' story line seems tacked on with very little point other than to represent a threat to Blank's oat sowing as, since he's sleeping with so many women, one of them is bound to be the mysterious post-coital assaulter.

Waters plays with this sort of blas magical realism that fails to keep us believing (in the characters and the film in general) and the rough cinematography and directing give the picture the feel that it's a student's piece.

Still... there are plenty of great lines and quite a few really great individual moments. Its just that, overall, they never gel together as a movie and are, instead, just that... a series of great lines and individual moments filmed to no effect.

3339882,3,B0013F2ESM,"This is in some ways a fun, smart, sexy movie, but it was hard for me to enjoy it.  I'll briefly sum up the pros and cons, and then I'll include a note for the curious with some more detail and a bit of movie philosophy about why this didn't work for me.  Here's the set-up:

Rod (Simon Baker) is a good-looking, successful man, about to be married, who receives from a mysterious but apparently reliable source a list of all 101 people he has had and will have sex with in his lifetime, in chronological order.  There are a lot of names that come after his fiancee's.  He becomes increasingly obsessed with the list, seeking the women out, having a mix of experiences that soon tend to degrade his life.  A subplot about an avenging woman who puts men into comas, ""Death Nell"" (Winona Ryder), finally catches up to him, though not in the expected way (well, not supposed to be expected, at least).

First, the good news is that Baker is well chosen, looks the part and projects irony well.  He's warm and easy to like, even when he's a heel.  Ryder is fine too, giving the role all it seems to call for.

There are some funny things in this movie, but the humor overall isn't as adult as I'd like in what's supposed to be an adult sex comedy.  It varies quite a bit.  There's a more-than-juvenile but less-than-fully-mature sensibility to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the film as a whole, and though there are wry observations and some jokes that require a few brain cells--actually more than I realized, as explained in the commentary--there's also a fair amount that would be at home in American Pie.

The sexuality, while sometimes fun, is generally not all that interesting.  Actually fairly tame for an R-rated sex comedy (nudity, sexual motions, and crude references), but that shouldn't have kept it from being more alluring and creative.  From the commentary we learn that writer/director Daniel Waters felt there wasn't time to get more out of that side of the film.  It was a very low-budget movie, around $4 million.

There seems to be some effort to make something substantial of the metaphysical questions of fate and freedom, but that doesn't go very deep.  The metaphysical premise works mainly as a plot device.

I think I might have enjoyed the movie overall despite the mismatch with some of the humor except for one other thing.  There was what came across as an inhumane or at least non-humane sensibility competing with and undercutting what seemed to be efforts at genuine humanity.  This involved things like an attempt at necrophilia with a loved one and serious spousal abuse as the material for easy laughs, in addition to what seemed a general irony about everything.  I'll say more about that in my note below, for those who want more detail (and to see why my review has the title it does).

Some people won't be bothered by any of that, or might even like that edgy sensibility, and hopefully you can tell who you are from what I've said.  And you might find the mix of low and higher-than-average humor positively Shakespearean.

The special features include the commentary by Waters, which is well worth hearing if you want a better idea of what he had in mind.  He explains many allusions to classic movies and literature that I completely missed.  There's also a 17-minute featurette on the film called 101 Perversions, and the trailer.  117 minutes.

A note on the odd mix of seemingly inhumane humor with humane themes

*Spoiler alert.*  I've written the following so as to keep spoilers to a bare minimum, but there are a couple things some might see as spoilers.  Nothing that should spoil your overall experience of the film, I think.  This is a broad comedy, so it may seem odd to take this seriously, but how comedy works, or doesn't, is a serious subject!  Or at least one we can philosophize about and try to figure out.

The problem as I see it is that Waters mixes what seems inhumane humor into the more humane moments of the film, which never firmly establishes a humane point of view, despite what Waters appears to intend, based on the movie itself and his commentary.  For example, one of the few real, sustained cases of affection and earnest emotion is cut off with a comical thud of a death and ends with an attempt at necrophilia, also played for laughs.  Later, another sustained relationship is developed in part over a montage that plays serious spousal abuse for laughs.  The film seems too well summed up by its last lines:

""Life is a lot like death; it happens to everyone whether they like it or not.
The meaning of it all?  Honestly, who gives a f***.""

That's a play on the basic conceit of the movie, the original title of which was Truly F***ed, and in which the f-word has a major role.  And it appears to actually have a positive meaning, which can be inferred from the scene itself (without giving anything away about why this applies): you might as well enjoy the good in life and not worry about the meaning.  But given what came before and the continued ironic stance, it's impossible not to also register it as the blow-off of life that it sounds like.  Hard to believe that aspect wasn't also intentional.

Then again, despite his many intentional film allusions, Waters says in the commentary that the line ""the list is life"" wasn't intended as an echo of Schindler's List, that he didn't notice the connection until afterwards.  Waters also says that he had to remove September 11th references because the producers insisted.  I don't think he had a full grasp of some of his material, despite some very detailed ideas about it that come out in the commentary.  I don't think he saw how unstable the anything-goes mix is and how much it undermines the more earnest goals he implies he has.  At least, if he did see it, he doesn't let on.

In any case, we get very mixed signals about whether anything has the kind of value that would raise it above the level of cheap, undignified jokes.  It may be that Waters sees no conflict between cheap jokes and dignity, or thinks that the human condition is a mix of both, no part of which is beyond the reach of the other.  Nothing is sacred, or at least not so purely sacred.  I actually think there's something to that, in principle, but in practice the chemistry involved is volatile and complex.  Among other things, it seems to me that the respect for the higher stuff needs to be all the more strongly established to mix in the potentially undermining stuff, and that wasn't done here.  It comes across as uncertain all the way through, which undermined my investment in the genuine emotional aspects of the movie.

Roderick Blank (Simon Baker) receives an anonymous email that lists all the women he has slept with & is going to be sleep with. Simon Baker is appropriately smarmy in the lead role, more stuck on himself than any woman he's had a relationship with. He's about to be married when this email comes in. The list contains 101 names; the 28 he has already slept with, the one he's about to marry & 72 more that are still in his future. We are treated to some of the encounters with these 72 but none are dwelt on very long. There are some funny complications on the way, in particular when there are two women that share the same name.

The second story line involves a femme fatale known as Death Nell (Winona Ryder) who is boring her dates into comas. The men she picks for her victims aren't terribly nice men but this is hardly touched upon.

All of this comes about because of some organization (eerily similar to Heaven but not that either) has a machine (please, not a computer!) that has sent out a few thousand emails erroneously. Some only contain dates which happens to be the final day of life for that particular individual. Apparently, the email to Roderick Blank is an unique one, no other email contains a list of named partners. This is never explained satisfactorily nor is the organization involved with this explained.

Most viewers will figure out where this is all leading to: the final encounter for Roderick Blank will be with Death Nell. Of course, this is the last thing he wants to do. The organization advises him not to have any more encounters with women in order to give them more time to stop Death Nell. At the time of this advice he has about twenty names left on the list so it sounds like sound advice. Unfortunately for him, while riding a bike he's hit by a bus loaded with 20 females (all aged 18 to 19) that are from a religious school on the way to a camp. After running over him, they all decide to take advantage of him & losing their sacredness. This leaves only one name on the list: Gillian De Raisx, better known as Death Nell.

The moral of the story is: Love is where you find it. The ending is no surprise at all but I won't spoil it for you. It's not a great movie nor is it a bad movie.",1217116800,2,2545,4.372093023255814

3339886,4,B0013F2ESM,"Spoilers warning and adult themed review to follow.

How can a sex comedy go wrong with such themes as turtle diarrhea, a lesbian power couple named Bambi and Thumper, a religious school bus group devirginization marathon, and/or knowing your sexual future? Or with script writing that includes a ""sloppy fusion of genitalia"", an ""intercourse buffet"" and a reference to that ""whore-bitch Jane Austen""? If you are not amused or are even offended right now - you might want to skip this movie (and review).

Daniel Waters has made a fun, original film about a man who is given the ""gift"" of knowing his future, specifically his upcoming sexual conquests, whether man or woman, all categorized on a nice list. Waters is oft remembered for his deviant writing with Heathers or Happy Campers, but in this case he gets to indulge a high volume of sexual perversions into one film.

The two leads were cast appropriately with a needed ""pretty boy"" in Simon Baker (I remember him most from his brief role in LA Confidential) and Winona Ryder playing the femme fatale/serial coma-inducer. A great supporting cast in Mindy Cohn, Julie Bowen (who I liked in the Ed TV series), the Janitor from Scrubs, Natasha Malthe, etc.

The film has two story lines, one involves the man who has it all that receives this list (origins of which can only be seen in the film to understand) containing all of his past and future sexual escapades. He gets this the week of his wedding - only to find out there are 60+ names listed after his soon to be wife. The other story is Winona's character resolving her past sufferings by inducing comas upon every man she sleeps with. The remaining twists and interlocking plots need to be watched as they can't be explained without spoiling too much. Which leads me to the extras...

The DVD docu titled ""101 Perversions"" is an excellent insight into the minds and motives behind this film - and for the first time on a disc docu - they actually disclaim the piece as containing spoilers and recommend that you watch the film first. Waters' interview gets some nice slams on present day big comedy films ""that suck"", but includes some nice homages to Benny Hill and Fellini for this film.

I think this is what my customers have been looking for in a ""good adult comedy"" that doesn't involve lowbrow humor or have National Lampoon in the title (the later NLs).",1214697600,18,2375,4.697115384615385

I blame the writer for that. The talent is there-- Mindy Cohn is excellent as is Julie Bowen (good to see her early stuff), Winona Ryder. However, Simon Baker steals the show with his rather tongue-in-cheek performance. I can see how it would be easy to over-play his character but Baker holds back and let's us see him slowly unravel. For being a ""heart throb"" so to speak, Baker is a talented actor and its a joy to see him perform. I suppose he could be considered the thinking woman's sex-symbol.

3339932,2,B0013F2ESM,"The movie is pretty boring. It's about a 2 hour movie and it has a very simple plot. A man get's a list of women that he had sex with, but the list also has names of women he never had sex with...but will later. He then goes out and find them and has sex with them. There are very few good moments that is actually fun to watch and it just gets pretty boring all other times. Just seeing what other ways does the guy needs to do to find out who is going to have sex with the only thing this movie will show you.

Winona Ryder is sexy as ever and I just give it 2 stars for that. She dresses in all black outfit all the time because she is Death nail and what she does is goes around killing men she will sleep with.

Spolier Alert!

The guy is supposed to sleep with 101 women and at the last women he is supposed to die. Well the 101 woman turns out to be Ryder and she doesn't kill him and instead those to end up liking each other and get marry. They live happily ever after and it's the end. I didn't like it because it doesn't make much sense to me at the end. It feels a little cheesy and dumb. Those two sure be the last two to ever make it all work out and to be together at the end was even more stupid.

3339933,2,B0013F2ESM,"Don't worry, this review will be spoiler free, but let's start with the basic plot. Simon Baker plays Roderick Blank, engaged to be married when his life is turned upside down by an E-Mail with 101 names on it - the first 29 of them being the women in his life he's had sex with, with number 29 being his fianc and the remaining 72 being his future lovers. Running parallel to this story is Winona Ryder, playing ""Death Nell,"" a vixen going around seducing men and putting them into comas for reasons that will reveal themselves toward the end.

I'm not even sure what genre to peg this under. It's a dark comedy, but not really when you compare it films like Very Bad Things or Jawbreaker, because it's not nearly as vicious. It's also kind of a romantic comedy, but not really as well, because the plot focuses mainly on Simon Baker bedding dozens of women throughout the film. Then you have Matrix-esque scenes in a white room which try to ponder philosophical questions about sex, love and life. The film doesn't really pick a clear path and comes off as erratic and unmemorable.

This isn't to say the film doesn't have its moments, it does on occasion, but clocking in at 100 minutes, the film dragged and was wholly forgettable.

That didn't happen. The plot is about as ridiculous as one could possibly be but somehow Baker pulled it off with just the right amount of cartoonish immaturity and eventually adult behavior to make this really dumb story enjoyable. Even that necrophiliac scene! That takes some trully skillful acting! The story itself, when one thinks about it, is not all that bad. I liked the underlying feminist message So overall the writing was admirable. The extra, where the writer/director explains how the film was made, talking over the entire show as it moves along, was interesting and informative. I didn't understand the part where he said Baker cried real tears when he read the last page of James Joyce's ""Ulysses."" Sounded like Baker has real-life literary/poetic sensitivities. Well, whatever. I checked that part of Ulysses on the Internet. Hadn't read it before. It's totally unreadable! But maybe not to others.

Only one thing lurks 'Death Nell' (Winona Ryder) a mysterious femme fatale who becomes an urban folk hero targeting men guilty of sex crimes against women. Written and directed by Daniel Waters the writer of 'Heathers' I did expected more black comedy, more edge, more Winona, a fun look at fantasies too good to be true.",1274659200,,605,4.45945945945946
3339943,3,B0013F2ESM,"After seeing ""Heathers"" as a preteen (boy, that seems a long time ago) I made it my business to follow Dan Waters' career.  After a brilliant dark comedy like ""Heathers,"" you assumed he was going to continue to write screenplays equally as dark and caustic as that.  But it didn't quite work out that way.  Oddly enough, he became something of an action writer.  The material was still dark and funny, but always with a big-budget action edge (""Ford Fairlane,"" ""Hudson Hawk,"" ""Batman Returns,"" ""Demolition Man"").  He wrote other projects -- an insane summer-camp script called ""Happy Campers"" (best described by Dan's brother as ""the 'Apocalypse Now' of camp movies""), an amusing adaptation of ""A Stranger in a Strange Land"" and a blistering satire of the fashion industry by the name of ""A Model Daughter"" -- but many of them got stuck in development and never made.  He did eventually direct ""Happy Campers"" on his own, but it was a disastrous, low-budget mess.

""Sex and Death 101"" is certainly better than ""Happy Campers,"" but it's not nearly as good as his earlier work, and it doesn't feel worth the six-year wait.

""S&D101"" was just never all that funny to me.  It's amusing, and you knew Dan would be good for an insightful rant or two about relationships and sex, but I can't actually remember ever laughing.  That he dips into a disgusting bit of Farrelly-esque humor is just a little sad to me.

The premise is this: a man, about to get married, gets an E-mail with the names of every woman he's slept with and every woman he will eventually sleep with.  The list essentially ruins him, as he seeks to find each woman and speed the process along.  He becomes addicted to the list.

There's a parallel storyline about a female serial killer the press calls Death Nell, who preys on men who exploit or hurt women.

I think the flaw of this movie comes in its casting and its story structure.

Simon Baker is a good-looking guy, but boyishly so.  He has that innocuous smile that makes it hard to dislike him.  He's pretty, but not sexy.  He doesn't really look like the type of guy women would fall head over heels in lust with.  I also find his character a little confusing.  When we first meet him, he's about to get married to a domineering and aggressive woman.  If he has such a rotund libido to satisfy, why is he settling?  The story of the list becomes a chicken/egg thing for me.  It almost seems like getting the list causes the licentiousness (since he basically just walks into a bar, sees someone on the list, and the person falls for him like they're under a spell) than the other way around.

The most interesting thing about the movie is Death Nell.  With swollen red lips pushing out through hanging curtains of jet-black hair, Winona Ryder has never looked sexier.  It's really great to see her in this type of role again.  She's always had a bit of a mysterious edge to her.  She presents an almost casual air to her murders.

It turns out Nell (or Gillian De Raisx) was a wife abused by a bizarre husband who liked for her to dress up in different costumes and then beat her.  He accidentally dies one night and Gillian decides she needs to help the women of the world out by removing a few of the bad men.  (Waters and Ryder get in a great ""Heathers"" reference when Gillian furiously scrawls in her journal.)

As you probably know already, the final name on Roderick's list is Gillian De Raisx.  Will it be death or love that makes her the last?

Once Roderick decides to face his fate and go after Gillian, this movie really kicks into gear.  The problem is that it happens an hour too late.  I personally think the bulk of the movie -- as Roderick discovers and experiences the ups and downs of the list -- could have been accomplished in short order.  I would have much rather seen Gillian and Roderick connect, with her not knowing he's aware of who she is.  He would be in a position of not knowing if she's going to kill him at any moment.  And she would have to decide if she was really in love or if it wasn't just easier to kill a man than work through a relationship with him.  Waters actually had something similar to this -- playing with the idea that you never truly know your partner -- in his unproduced ""Catwoman"" script.

This movie probably has the funniest end line of all time, but otherwise it never really comes alive.  Dan Waters has always been better at showing the bad behavior of men through a woman's point of view.  Here we're in a man's and it feels a little immature and artificial.

Outside of Ryder's performance, I consider this film a letdown.",1262563200,,4608,4.492178098676294

In part of the film, Simon Baker's character is confronted with a woman who is just as creative, attractive and interesting as he is who is not certain whether or not she wants a platonic or romantic relationship with him. This section speaks to everyone: we have all had the one person in our life that we think would be perfect for us romantically --- but whom, because of timing, emotional confusion or lack of interest doesn't feel the same way. This film showcases the beauty and frustration of this sort of relationship from beginning to end in a dark, funny and heartbreaking way.

I can't tell you how many times I have watched a romantic comedy and the tension of unrequited love is resolved unrealistically when the reluctant or resistant girl or guy eventually being swept off his/her feet by a crazy public display of affection or some ridiculous plot twist. Truthfully, only ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""500 Days of Summer"" seem to get their unrequited love plots ""right.""

3339949,4,B0013F2ESM,"""Sex and Death 101"" is a dark and savvy little romantic comedy that gleefully dances away from many of the stale and stuffy conventions generally associated with the genre.

Simon Baker stars as the allegorically named Roderick Blank, a handsome, seemingly insatiable lady killer who's decided it's finally time to put an end to his womanizing ways in favor of marriage to the beautiful Fiona Wormwood.  Yet, literally on the eve of his bachelor party, Rod receives a mysterious email listing in chronological order not only all the women he's already slept with throughout the course of his life but all the women he is destined to sleep with in the time that still remains to him (the total is 101, if you haven't already surmised that from the film's title).  Adhering to the adage ""the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak,"" Rod allows the list to essentially take over his life, waiting for the next promised woman to fall into his lap (sometimes quite literally), then crossing her name off the moment he`s had his way with her.  But is this truly the route to a satisfying life, even for a notorious playboy like Roderick Blank?

Part science fiction and part metaphysical morality play, ""Sex and Death 101"" also boasts two wacky subplots that run contrapuntal to the main story:  one featuring Winona Ryder as an avenging feminist who comes in the guise of a serial killer, luring unsuspecting misogynists to their well-deserved destruction; and the other involving  three mysterious figures (mad scientists, intervening angels?) who kidnap Rod to inform him that he has been the victim of some bizarre cosmic prank and that he needs to destroy the list before it destroys him.

""Sex and Death 101"" is not a perfect film by any means.  Its attempts at surrealism are frequently heavy-handed and strained, and its black-comedy edge isn`t always as razor-sharp as it could be.  But, on the whole, this is a wildly original and surprisingly incisive look at the different ways in which men and women view sex and romance and the different ways they use both those things to get what they want.  Writer/director Daniel Waters knows how to set even the most hackneyed romantic comedy clich spinning on its head.  For instance, the movie takes the obligatory ""gay best friend"" stereotype - who usually comes in the form of a flaming interior decorator or wedding planner - and turns it into a wise-cracking lesbian (smartly played by Mindy Cohn, best known as Natalie from ""The Facts of Life""), whose duties as Rod's personal secretary go far beyond merely scheduling his appointments or knowing where his briefcase is.

Although Rod is, in many ways, a typical character for a romantic comedy - afraid of commitment, obsessed with nailing every woman who comes his way, etc. - the route the script takes to get him to his admittedly rather predictable pro-woman/pro-romance epiphany is anything but typical.  This freshness is further enhanced by the devilishly playful and utterly disarming performance turned in by Baker who completely captivates the viewer with his easygoing charisma and charm.  The scene in which Baker and Ryder finally share screen time together is exceptionally well acted and staged.

Even though the movie feels a little disjointed and unfocused at times, Waters does a nice job dovetailing all the seemingly unrelated plot elements into a satisfying whole in the end.

3339953,4,B0013F2ESM,"""Sex and Death 101"" sounds like the name of a college course, and indeed, it could work well as a study companion for critical theory classes, specifically those covering the Fate versus Free Will debate. I'm reminded of ""The Golden Compass,"" a wonderful fantasy film about keeping free will on a short leash; there are those who oppose it, which by default suggests that it exists. ""Sex and Death 101,"" a fascinating dark comedy about a man and a list of names, seems to take the exact opposite approach. Fate determines what will happen to us, not free will. Writer/director Daniel Waters regards this idea with a tragic sense of awe, and this is despite the fact that (1) the film is often times very funny, and (2) that it ends on a very satisfying note. It could be that, even if we're made to live the happiest of lives, there's no comfort in knowing that we have absolutely no control over what we say or do.

This movie tells the story of Roderick Blank (Simon Baker), a thirty-something executive for a successful fast food chain called Swallows. He has everything a man could want: a great job, a great fiance named Fiona (Julie Bowen), and great friends. After marrying Fiona, he would like nothing more than to settle down and have a family. One day, his office computer receives an anonymous e-mail containing the names of 101 women. When his assistant, Trixie (Mindy Cohn), reads off the first few names, he thinks that it's a list of the women he slept with before meeting Fiona. It stands to reason that her name would be at the bottom. Unfortunately, it isn't; she's only number twenty-nine. Roderick briefly considers the idea that it's all a practical joke, or maybe someone is reminding him of what he'll be giving up in order to marry Fiona. Then he actually meets one of the other listed women, and lo and behold, they somehow or another end up having sex. This list knows all.

Initially, Roderick believes he's hit a stroke of good luck. But as he crosses names off of the list, he begins to wonder if the thrill of the hunt is more enticing than the catch. Within no time at all, sex has become chore. Some of his flings are entriely accidental, and this definitely includes the leprosy-stricken grandmother of a sexy centerfold. Some are just plain bizarre: Who would have thought he had a chance with a power lesbian couple, who also happen to be reality TV stars? At a certain point, Roderick begins dating a quirky but loveable veterinarian named Miranda Storm (Leslie Bibb), and for the first time since losing Fiona, he believes he's found the one woman he can settle down with. But does she feel the same way about him? And what about the fact that there are more names on the list? What about fate?

Intertwined with this story is a feminist vigilante known as Death Nell (Winona Ryder), who's striking fear into the hearts of men. Her trademark: Putting sex criminals and misogynists into permanent comas after seducing them. Her real name is Gillian de Raisx, a reference to Gilles de Rais, a fifteenth century French nobleman who was tried and executed for murdering dozens, if not hundreds, of children. One wonders why Waters named his femme fatale after such a horrible man; Gillian has legitimate reasons for doing what she does, which is probably why a number of feminist organizations consider her a hero. ""Did they really catch that satanic succubus?"" asks one of Roderick's obnoxious friends. ""No,"" Trixie responds, ""and the word is `freedom fighter.'"" What exactly does this have to do with Roderick? As it turns out, Gillian is the 101st name on the list.

Keeping tabs on both Gillian and Roderick is a mysterious organization. That's about as specific as I can get, which doesn't mean that I'm intentionally keeping a secret from you; it means that virtually nothing about it is explained. There are only two things we know for sure. First, within a mysterious white room sits a special computer that relies on quantum mechanics to predict the future, the same computer that e-mailed the list to Roderick. Second, gray-suited men named Alpha (Robert Wisdom), Beta (Tanc Sade), and Fred (Patton Oswald) are apparently the only three people running the organization. These characters work in and of themselves. Alpha was even given one of the film's most telling lines during a scene with Roderick: ""Horoscopes, psychics, tarot cards, coming attractions that give away the whole movie--why must you people know everything?"" But the entire concept of the computer and the organization utilizing it is just plain maddening.

Then again, that could have been the intention all along, and I have to admit that I enjoyed every scene featuring the gray-suited men. We may not know who they are, but at least their dialogue is interesting. And their cryptic observations on fate keep the audience alert. Keep in mind that the very idea of fate will always raise certain questions. Here's the most famous one: Would you want to know the exact date, time, and location of your death if given the opportunity? I think the message ""Sex and Death 101"" is sending is that, because you can't change fate, there's no point in knowing ahead of time what will happen. This is a strange but deeply thought-provoking film, often hilarious, often irreverent, and even at its most outrageous, it's always compelling.",1227225600,2,5341,4.788503253796096

And, with 101 names on the list and his fiancee coming in at number 29, it doesn't look good for the health of the upcoming marriage.

Doesn't matter anyway, as the engagement is soon broken off. Intrigued by the possibilities, Rod proceeds to go down the list and thru women after women. Meanwhile, the media has been going on and on about the enigmatic serial killer nicknamed Death Nell, a seductress who beds jerks and then puts them in comas. And what are the odds that she's on Rod's weird list? Hint: odds are pretty good.

Witty and thought-provoking, sexy and hilarious. These are words which do not apply to this movie. Going into SEX AND DEATH 101, I was pretty stoked at the premise and anticipating all the good stuff that writer/director Daniel Waters had in store (after all, dude wrote the awesomely subversive film classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers-20th-High-School-Reunion-Edition/dp/B00180OU4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers - 20th High School Reunion Edition</a>). But afterwards saw me feeling bummed and so bored and tired and pretty mad. SEX AND DEATH 101 is, I guess, a sex farce which you might, just might enjoy if you're fratting it out with the homies. Otherwise, it just doesn't generate that feeling of ""Oboy, am I glad I tuned in to this!"" Supposedly a dark comedy, the comedy is dang vapid and can only be considered ""dark"" by people who insist that CHARLES IN CHARGE was controversial. The characters are sluggish and unengaging (with, strangely enough, Winona Ryder's murderous femme fatale being the most sympathetic). And there's an air of smugness about the whole thing, almost as if Daniel Waters is actually proud of this project.

I am a manly dude with some hair on his chest, and this is a movie blessed with stunning women... but it left me cold. Of course, most of the ladies are there simply to be grinded thru the movie plot machine, so that names could start getting crossed off Rod's magic list. Three women do get smidgens of depth: Julie Bowen (of the much lamented television show ED), Leslie Bibb (of the much lamented&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popular-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0001I55S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popular - The Complete First Season</a>), and Winona Ryder (just much lamented). The rest of the ladies come off as sexy cardboard cutouts. So, yeah, it turns out, even with so many gorgeous women on screen, it's still quite easy to become jaded. It's almost like porno, but without the interesting music.

Simon Baker. He's the biggest reason I couldn't get into SOMETHING NEW, a romantic dramedy which stars one of my favorites, Sanaa Lathan. Simon Baker is tall and handsome and self-satisfied; he's your basic non-threatening looking male. He's also bland to the bone, a quality which attracts women with insomnia and women who knit for adventure. Needless to say, I did not like him in SEX AND DEATH 101. Is it too cold to use the word ""languid"" when describing a guy?

A quick segue: Does the mysterious e-mail ever get explained? Well, there's a subplot involving a super computer and three guys gigged out in white. It smacks vaguely of something supernatural.

Okay, back to my quibbling.

You ever get mad at having wasted your time watching a stinky movie? If I had a dog, I would've kicked it.

Trying to be nice, I came up with about four positives about the film. One: Winona Ryder. Two: surprisingly, it has an aw-shucks feel-good ending. Three: for the dudes, ample female nudity. And four: it's nice to see that Mindy Cohn (FACTS OF LIFE) is still among the living. I was wondering.

The film is a great piece of entertainment, as it has a fine cast and never really gets boring (though maybe pushes it now and then; after all, it has a repeating plot point: meeting women and engaging in sex with them), though it intends to be rather thoughtful/inspirational I think, and in that regard I think it will only work for a section of its audience. Most of the film's introspective qualities are aimed at the serial dater, one-night stand aficionado, sex addict, whatever, but, of course, come from the Hollywoodland mindset, where people seem to think everyone falls into that category (and the public sadly buys into it). There's this long-standing idea around that all normal males spend their first 30 to... whenever they get married years attempting to mount anything that moves, and it's widely believed because, A. People who ARE that way like to say everyone is that way, and B. It's the way women think all men are (but that's just because those are the only kind of men they'll date). So, if you are one of the rare breed who doesn't buy that every guy lives his life on a quest to cut as many notches into his bedpost as possible, or that everyone in real life has engaged in meaningless fast-food sex at one time in their life or other, this one will probably stop at ""entertainment value"" for you. Luckily, it succeeds in that arena enough that it should work for anyone.

The film's cast is one of its best qualities, and Simon Baker, whom I know best from George A. Romero's ""Land of the Dead"", a great film, is truly the star here as charmingly screwed-up Roderick Blank, but there is a fine roster of leading ladies too, the most memorable being the beautiful Leslie Bibb, who gives Roderick his first experience with ""the friend zone"" (Leslie reminds me of Tuesday Weld as Thalia Menninger here, she even looks like her; but I must say that the constantly pushed by the media and this character idea of a plutonic male/female friendship is entirely idealistic and impossible, a pure female fantasy, and that doesn't mean it's always about sex either), not to mention Winona Ryder, whose path doesn't even cross with the star's until close to the end of the picture. The gorgeous Amanda Walsh makes an appearance in the film that I feel like mentioning too (she's so cute, has the face of TinkerBell), but unfortunately isn't even onscreen for a full minute. I'll also throw in a mention of Patton Oswalt, who you'll possibly recognize as the voice of Remy in ""Ratatouille"". He has a small recurring part in the film as some great comic relief playing one of the guys tied in with the source of ""the list"", but I don't want to give too much away about that.

The writer/director of the film, Daniel Waters, is most closely associated here with the movie ""Heathers"". For the record, and I'm sure few will agree with me, despite the fact that I don't agree with him in all of his ideas presented in this movie (no doubt, most people probably WOULD agree with him on them rather than with me), I think ""Sex and Death 101"" is the better film. I used to enjoy ""Heathers"" back in the day, though the target audience was more my older sister's generation, but when I revisited the film sometime last year, I found it to be rather dated and unfunny. I don't think this one will seem so dated. ""Sex and Death 101"" is a fascinating ride. I disagree that people in general are as lascivious as Hollywood tends to present them (not that they don't pretend to be, and not that most folks in Hollywood aren't that way), I don't buy that as many people as film and TV tells us are having sex whenever they take a notion to, wherever they happen to be, with whomever they see that's halfway attractive (though probably more are nowadays since they've been seeing it on TV the past 30 years), but it's still fun to watch what one guy did when he came across a very strange list. The movie was full of surprises and had a good cast, and that kept it interesting. It's well worth checking out at least once if movies about sex don't scare you away. The DVD provides the trailer, a behind the scenes featurette, and a very informative director commentary (which teases us by talking about deleted scenes at one point that didn't actually make it into the extras in the end). If you're a fan of any of the actors in Sex and Death 101, you'll probably want to pick it up, though the only one who is truly in it from beginning to end is Simon Baker (well, and The Facts of Life's Mindy Cohn as his assistant, Trixie). If not, you should probably see it before buying.",1219276800,2,5768,4.538904899135447
3339968,2,B0013F2ESM,"This one's clearly targeted at a male audience, as I can't see how much enjoyment of female viewer would get out of our male character conquering 101 members of the opposite sex.  The premise is a very strange one, with our main lead getting plucked by some futuristic, secret office who presents him with a list of all the females he has ever slept with, and the many more he will end up sleeping with.  We never fully understand how or why this is happening, but it puts the movie into one big set up for crude joke after crude joke of how our lead gets hooked up with all the girls on his list.  It features some very funny scenarios, while many more end up rather awkward and flat.

The best moments in the film are when our main character settles in to the 101st name on the list, Winona Ryder, a near-serial killer of sorts.  I say near serial killer, as she merely drugs her victims and puts them into comas.  These scenes feature a glimpse of how good the movie could have been, if the first 75% of the film was simply rewritten.

I'd say if you're of the male DVD viewing variety, you may find a hilarious moment or two in this male having sex with many women romp.  If you're a female viewer, I'd strongly caution you stay away from this clearly sexist farce.",1218499200,,1269,4.2803347280334725
3339969,1,B0013F2ESM,"Watching a direct-to-DVD movie is gamble, but once in awhile you hit upon a surprisingly good one. More often, unfortunately, you get stuck with a real turkey.

And then there are movies like ""Sex and Death 101"" - a movie that is such a terminal bore that you wind up feeling like a fool for wasting time on it. The dialogue rings so false - it sounds as if it was written all for one character. In other words, all of these characters speak in the same pseudo-witty way that they all blend together.

Let me start off by saying, even if you are a Winona Ryder fan you might want to skip this one. She's barely in it! Her name and likeness are featured prominently on the DVD cover, but it borderlines on false advertising. To make matters worse, she is the only real movie star in this pitiful trash. Comedian Patton Oswald is maybe the second most notable performer, and his fans are sure to be disappointed as well in the way he is wasted in a small and largely unnecessary role. The acting is hideously subpar all around, especially the unrelentingly smug Simon Baker in the starring role.

The movie takes forever (okay, maybe not literally - but it takes about half the running time) to set up the premise. And once it does, I couldn't make sense of it. Simon Baker's character is presented with an e-mail that lists all the people he's had sex with and goes on to list all the people he will have sex with in the future. This ends up changing his marriage plans, as he frolics around from woman to woman. And Winona Ryder plays someone known as 'Death Nell' - a seductress who's companions always wind up dead.

If any of that sounds intriguing, I implore you to reconsider. The guy who wrote and directed this movie, Daniel Waters, wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers-20th-High-School-Reunion-Edition/dp/B00180OU4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers - 20th High School Reunion Edition</a>. If you haven't seen that, by all means proceed directly there. Even if you HAVE seen it, multiple times even, revisit it because I honestly would say that is time better spent. The box cover has the word ""sex"" in big capital letters, and yes there is some nudity here and there - but not enough to make it worthwhile even for those seeking that. The one saving grace is that this movie is so boring and lifeless that I will probably forget it very soon.",1217980800,2,2406,4.7764423076923075
3339970,4,B0013F2ESM,"Told through first-person narration, Sex and Death 101 is a little like the Wachowskis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;collides with Shainberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secretary/dp/B00008DDSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secretary</a>&nbsp;(stick with me here). The premise: a (sentient?) ""machine"" has begun interfering with humanity, issuing e-mails that reveal a person's fate. While many people received an e-mail revealing their death-day, Roderick Blank was ""gifted"" with a list of every woman he has and WILL sleep with. Sounds great, right? Well, what the viewer learns is that ""the chase"" is fairly boring when the results are a given. Watching Rodrick try to plow through his list is dark and hysterical (especially when we reach Bambi and Thumper ... a world-class, lesbian power-couple). Now for the twist, the FINAL person on Roderick's list is a notorious serial-killer ...

With a budget of five-million, Waters created a pretty slick film. The casting is quirky (in a fantastic way!!). Patton Oswalt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-Queens/dp/B000VECAE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of Queens</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratatouille/dp/B000VBJEEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratatouille</a>) plays a lascivious lackey to the ""Morpheus-like"" Alpha. I'm entirely biased here (since I think Oswalt is one of the most adorable, underrated actors in Hollywood), but his character alone makes the film worth watching. Moreover, Mindy Cohn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Facts-of-Life/dp/B000EQ45BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Facts of Life</a>) was a brave and fabulous choice. All grown up, Cohn rocks her character. She adds sweetness to (what could have been) your typical ""lesbian"" character. Kudos!! Julie Bowen, Winona Ryder, and Simon Baker nicely round-out the cast. Overall, the acting is wonderfully on-point. We could genuinely loathe the character of Roderick BUT Baker brings an irrefutable charm to him. And, this is where the film is a success. Roderick may be a slick, handsome, fast-food King (""Have a startling and unique day!!""), but as he resigns himself to fate he becomes brooding and vulnerable. Love it.

Why should you watch this work? One: it has a montage of lower-back, Chinese-symbol tattoos to represent the passage of time (a great joke resides in this moment ... pay attention). Two: watching Roderick don faerie-wings just to join Bambi and Thumper (in slow-motion) ... TOTALLY WORTH IT! (And so funny). Three: the scene with the school bus ... that's all I can say (by far, the absolutely most unpredictable, wildly amusing moment).

I noticed that this work is receiving some seriously scathing reviews. As a harsh-critic, I respect the opinions of others. I have a feeling this film appeals to a niche crowd: one which seeks dark, erotic, adult faerie-tales (a la Shainberg's Secretary ... see, I told you to stay with me). If, like me, you find the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie</a>&nbsp;style of films trite and juvenile, give Water's work a spin.

3339971,3,B0013F2ESM,"This film has more charm and fun than it has been given credit for but don't expect it to appear on AFI's next list of 100 best comedies.  ""Sex and Death 101"" stars Simon Baker as Roderick Blank, a successful fast food entrepreneur and randy ""ladies man"" who has decided to get married to escape the rat race and embrace the committed life of his married friends.

However, a mysterious computer/Oracle sends him an email with a list of every woman he has ever had sex with or ever will have sex with, in chronological order.  Baker realizes that if the list is accurate, and it seems to be, he will have sex with many more women after his marriage so he cancels the marriage he didn't really want.  Instead, he becomes obsessed with the list and contrives ways to meet each name on the list with the growing certainty that sex will result.

This is an innovative premise for a movie and certainly explores some provocative ideas.  If presented with such a list and the knowledge that it was accurate, what would you do if you knew you had ""carte blanche"" for ""sure things?""  How rapidly would you approach exhausting the names on the list if you knew it was chronologically there for the taking?  Would you be apprehensive about  what happens after the last name on your list was ""crossed off?""  Does sex and intimacy ultimately have personal meaning if there is never doubt or challenge involved?  And the ultimate question, who is in charge--the list (or machine which created it) or the protagonist?

Such an intriguing set up is never quite maximized as it could have been.  Unfortunately, the movie's tone shifts at times from comedy to fantasy to serious to philosophical resulting in an uneven ride for the viewer.  Baker's obsession leads him from a spirit of wonder to arrogance and predictably to boredom.  Some of his assignations with women will make you smile but mostly they are there to be endured as Baker begins an inner soul searching as to what love and intimacy should really be.

A concurrent story line presents Winona Ryder as a dangerously alluring femme fatale, Death Nell, who has sexual meetings with men who have committed sex crimes against women and , Black Widow-like, leaves them in a drug induced coma while spray painting graffiti and poetry on their walls.  Ryder and Baker have a number of instances where they just miss crossing paths as she leaves one victim and he leaves one of his ""conquests""--we just know these two star-crossed protagonists are bound to meet sooner or later.

The subplot of three mysterious men in gray suits locked in a white room with the giant machine/computer/oracle that spits out the fate of mortals and who project an all-seeing, all-knowing glibness to Baker is never fully realized.  Also, I felt the casting was off in a few cases--most notably with Baker's assistant.  Several key changes in the cast utilizing some more appropriate comedic talent might have changed the overall appeal of this film because the plot was innovative enough to succeed more than it does.

The film has some funny and some poignant scenes, just not enough of them.  I liked the scenes of Baker's awkwardness with his buddies'wives at group outings that are counterbalanced by his buddies when they are alone with him.  It is a clever story that does not reach it potential yet can be recommended as a fun and charming movie if the viewer has realistic expectations.",1217462400,3,3417,4.744500846023689
3339972,1,B0013F2ESM,"At 2 hours long, this film dragged and dragged.  I was watching the clock thinking, I can't believe it's less than halfway through ... can't believe there's still 45 minutes to go ... can't believe another 25 minutes left.

A man (Simon Baker) is sent a list of all the women he will have sex with in his life, while a woman (Winona Ryder) goes around putting men into comas.  In the end, they meet.

Along the way, Baker learns ""lessons about life.""  Supposedly.

Oh yeah, there's also a MATRIX parody somewhere in there, with a wise, bald black guy, with a deep baritone voice, lecturing to Baker as though he were Neo.

HEATHERS writer Daniel Waters reteamed with HEATHERS star Winona Ryder to make this film. Like other reviewers, I loved HEATHERS (and most of Ryder's pre-2001 work).  Maybe that's the problem.

SEX AND DEATH 101 feels like Waters wanted to recreate his past success by writing (and now, also directing) a supposedly ""dark comedy"" starring Winona Ryder.

Sounds like a ""deal memo"" film, i.e., some agent listed the ""creative elements"" in a memo -- Waters, Ryder, sex, black comedy, boffo! -- then gave it to a studio executive.  This film must have looked good on paper.

In the special features, Waters says he wanted to create ""a serious film about sex,"" but it's formulaic.  Worse, it's a mish-mash of conflicting formulas.

Problems:

* Film is too self-conscious.  It's trying too hard to be a ""black comedy,"" because it's aware that HEATHERS was a black comedy.  It feels like the characters die in flippant ways, not because it was necessary for the story, but because it worked in HEATHERS.  Yet this film is not darkly humorous. It's just flippant and shallow.

* Despite its flippancy, this film also tries to be ""deep.""  There's much voice-over by Baker, who informs us of his Deep Thoughts about love and sex and the meaning of life, etc.  But his Deep Thoughts are as insightful and unique as the Deep Thoughts on Saturday Night Live.  (But not funny.  Not even unintentionally funny.)

* Thus, SEX AND DEATH 101 doesn't know whether to be flippant and oh-so-hip, or deep and sincere, or funny, or what.  It's all over the map -- and what is it with that MATRIX black guy?

Ryder has a small role in this film; she's not on screen much.  About 20 minutes out of 2 hours.  Well, it's Baker's film.

Ryder is good, but she hasn't been in a great film in nearly a decade.  Not her fault.",1217462400,5,2419,4.58411214953271
3339973,2,B0013F2ESM,"Yes, folks, it's true.  Natalie from ""The Facts of Life"" has grown up to be a foul-mouthed lesbian in the film, ""Sex and Death 101"" (which I believe made a quick exit from movie theaters when it was released earlier this year). Actress Mindy Cohn does have a few amusing lines in the film (""I'm hoping for an autograph--or a three-way"", which sounds a lot funnier coming out of her mouth).  She plays the lead character's secretary, Trixie, who helps her boss deal with a mysterious email list of all the names of everyone he's had sex with and ever will have sex with in the future.  It's a bizarre concept that makes for a confusing, boring and LONG (it's 117 minutes) ""comedy"".

The lead character, Roderick Blank, is played by actor Simon Baker, who is a blank when it comes to comedy.  The guy just ain't funny, no matter how hard he tries--but I will put most of the blame on the writing of his dull character by writer/director Daniel Waters.  However, Mr. Baker is an attractive man with a dazzling smile and nice pecs (which he reveals in a few shirtless scenes).

As for Winona Ryder, who receives second billing, she's sadly wasted in an underwritten role.  The actress barely appears in the first 90 minutes of the film! And her character, Death Nell (yes, that is her name), is a crazy femme fatale who puts men into comas.  Her storyline doesn't have much to do with the rest of the movie until the very end.  I won't spoil the ""fun"", but I found the ending of the film to be totally unbelievable.  It's such a shame about Ryder's disappointing role because she can really act when given a good script (i.e. ""Heathers"" or one of my favorites, ""Mermaids"").  If you're thinking of buying/renting ""Sex and Death 101"" because you're a Winona fan, don't.  You've been warned.

Director/writer Daniel Waters wrote ""Heathers""--but he also wrote ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" and ""Hudson Hawk"", which is the group that I would stick ""Sex and Death 101"" in.  I'm being very generous by giving the film 2 stars, but Mindy Cohn deserves one of the stars for stealing every scene she's in--and it was just so nice to see ""Natalie"" again.  The other star goes to Mr. Baker's smile and pecs, which are very pleasant to view.  There's also some female nudity for those of you who enjoy that kind of thing.  Unfortunately, there are very few laughs to be found.

The DVD does include an audio commentary by Mr. Waters, a behind-the-scenes featurette with interviews with the stars/director, and the movie's trailer.",1217376000,,2517,4.6410835214446955

The premise makes no sense and the scenes -- I started to say ""story"" -- unfolds with a self-indulgent pretentiousness that is jawdropping.

Don't misunderstand me.  This isn't a movie that's so bad it's good.  It's not a cult film that can be discovered and enjoyed for its daring but failed artistry or something subversive aimed at narrow genre audience.  No, this is a horribly misguided affair from frame one.  And it just drags on and on and on.  I spent 117 minutes with this dreadfully repulsive and offensive digital disc and am only spending a few more minutes writing this as a warning to others.  Life is precious.

8250531,2,B0013F2ESM,"Disappointing sex comedy written and directed by Daniel Waters, the screenwriter behind Heathers, Demolition Man and Hudson Hawke who hasn't had much success since the early 1990's.  The plot concerns a man about to get married who is e-mailed a list of all the women he slept with in chronological order--which includes a large number of women after the name of his fiance.  When he sleeps with the next name on the list without even intending to he realizes the list is legit and breaks off his engagement so he can have sex with all the names on the list without a guilty conscience.

It's possible that Daniel Waters was trying to make some kind of point with this movie but it escaped me.  The lead character is thrilled at first but knowing the future has its downsides--and eventually the hero finds himself miserable with his series of one night stands that only lead to further one night stands, with no hope of a successful long term relationship in sight.

There is also a feminist serial killer on the prowl who is putting misogynist men into a coma (which might not technically make her a serial killer) played by Winona Ryder.  Is it fate that the two will eventually cross paths?

Sex and Death 101 is extremely easy to sit through and it made me smile a couple times but I don't think I actually laughed even once.  There's a surface cleverness to much of the film that never translates into it actually being funny.  Lead actor Simon Baker also doesn't manage to make you care about his character, and without a central figure to root for Sex and Death 101 just kind of glides past without ever becoming very engaging.  It's basically the cinematic equivalent of a bag of potato chips--empty calories that you might not feel too good about by the time you finish the bag.  A movie called Sex and Death 101 could also use a lot more sex and nudity than is actually on hand here.  This movie feels surprisingly tame and polite, which might be part of the problem--maybe Sex and Death 101 is just too inoffensive for its own good.

It's possible that a stronger director would have brought some snap and bite to the material--screenwriters rarely make good film directors because they generally can't see past what they've written down on the page.  Occasionally there's an exception, but based on this movie and his earlier and funnier effort Happy Campers Daniel Waters doesn't appear to be it.  Sex and Death 101 is light on laughs, sex, nudity and even death but it's probably not the worst date movie in the world, which I guess is something.",1487462400,,2561,4.622516556291391
