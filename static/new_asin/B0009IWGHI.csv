2294682,5,B0009IWGHI,"My 22 month old has been a big Elmo fan since birth, but her 2 year checkup is coming up, and I was hoping this video might help ease her fears. I think it will do the trick! She loves seeing Elmo go to the doctor - and will yell ""Elmo! Doctor!"" whenever she wants to see the video (which is a lot!!). I personally love all of this video, even the non-Elmo parts (about 15 mins worth in the middle), although my daughter will chant ""Elmo,Elmo,Elmo"" to get me to fast forward thru those. But we're working on it! The songs are really cute, and it's very educational too. If you love Elmo like we do, you'll love this one!",1132099200,5,620,4.132231404958677

2294717,5,B0009IWGHI,"I highly recommend this video b/c at some point every kid gets sick &/or has to go to the doctor. I have bought a lot of Elmo videos, but this one is my 17 month old granddaughter's favorite--mine too! It is good for any age kid under 11yrs old. Especially funny is the part where Bert & Ernie talk about how long (23 years) it takes to become a doctor. The songs also stick in your head.lol",1457136000,,391,4.090909090909091

2294720,5,B0009IWGHI,I don't care for all of the newer Sesame Street out there. But this older show is great! They do a nice job talking about what happens at the doctor's office while making it fun & non-scary. I appreciated the fact that they were realistic about mentioning if something hurt or not (like a shot). My little one really enjoyed it & laughed a number of times. Great video!,1435190400,,369,4.36231884057971

This movie did a great job helping her to overcome her fear of going to the doctors. I recommend this to any parent who has a kid who hates to go to the dr.

2294783,5,B0009IWGHI,"I bought this video a couple of weeks ago and was saving it for a trip, but decided to open it sooner after my toddler had a traumatic doctor's appointment.  She really loved this video.  Elmo is her favorite, so she enjoyed seeing him.  She also seemed very interested in the parts where kids were shown going to the doctor.  I think this will help her to be less afraid of the doctor.",1364515200,,386,4.2465753424657535

2294785,4,B0009IWGHI,"I had my 15 month old daughter watch this DVD everyday for a week before we had her check-up, and I must say I think it really helped. Elmo has an earache, so he has to go see the doctor, while he's there he runs into many other friends who are there to see the doctor too! It also includes an episode of Elmo's World dealing with the same subject. A great buy!",1363564800,,361,3.958904109589041

I couldn't find the book, but I found this DVD. I started to show this about a month before his 3-year-old check up. When we went to the doctor, he didn't cry like the last time. He wasn't afraid of nurses and doctors. He was so ready to get a shot, but doctor didn't give him any and he was disappointed.
I don't know if this works to every kid, but it was a great success for my son and me.",1352419200,,549,3.782608695652174

2294820,5,B0009IWGHI,"I really liked this video. It was funny, charming and educational.

I was impressed the little jokes that were placed by Sesame St.

There was definitely some influence of practicing pediatricians on the video. It really make kids more comfortable going to the doctors office.",1326931200,,276,5.111111111111111
2294821,4,B0009IWGHI,This is a cute video to add to your collection.  Its not as good as the wild wild west though.  My daughter will watch this all the way through but I don't think its as cute as others I have seen but its still worth watching.,1300147200,,225,3.869565217391304
2294822,5,B0009IWGHI,"I started to dread doctor visits when our then-1-year-old daughter became terrified of going to the doctor after she had to endure some invasive medical procedures starting at 8 months old.  She would start crying when being weighed and basically continue through the entire visit!  Poor thing, she was so scared!  And nothing we did seemed to help.  Ironically, her father is a doctor so we'd visit him all the time in his office and she'd see the examine rooms, and everything associated with the doctor (the instruments, white coats, etc.) but when it came time for her check-up, she caught on quickly that this was not fun-time-with-Dada and start howling.  We tried lots of things- playing with her Dad's doctor instrument, getting play instruments to examine me & the dog, etc.  Nothing worked!

Then I came across this video due to an Amazon recommendation when our daughter was almost 2 years old (I wish I would have found it at 18 months!  I really think it would have worked at that age).  She was taken with the video and asked to watch it frequently.  We watched it for 1 month off-and-on before going to her 2 year check-up today.  IT WAS AMAZING!!  She didn't cry at all and was excited for the whole process.  She understood we were going to the doctor and seemed actually excited!  We brought a stuffed Elmo (and of course her favorite blankie) and the whole thing was a breeze.  She examined Elmo and our very patient doctor also examined Elmo and was then more than happy to be examined herself.  My husband and I were amazed.  She was OK with everything- the vitals process & her examination!  She said ""thank you"" and blew a kiss to her doctor.  I almost passed out with relief!

She had to get two shots and she understandably still cried at that point.  But, she got stickers afterwards (Elmo does also in the video) so she perked up much faster than she did in the past.

This video really worked for us!!  I highly recommend it.  It is post-appointment now as I write this and it's nice not to be emotionally exhausted and it was so amazing to she our daughter not scared and actually interacting with the exam!  Hope this helps!",1297036800,3,2154,4.561357702349869
2294823,5,B0009IWGHI,"Everytime my daughter sees this, she wants to go and see the doctor!!!  I am hoping she is learning that the doctor is your friend and does not hurt.

2294826,5,B0009IWGHI,My daughter used to scream at the doctor's office. We bought this and watched it several times before her 2-year-old appointment. It worked great. She didn't even cry when the doctor examined her.,1282176000,,196,4.96969696969697

2294866,3,B0009IWGHI,"this dvd is okay, but i think my daughter will like it more when she gets older.  she does not understand the whole ""doctor visit"" thing, so it does not quite keep her interest as much as the other elomos world dvd's, such as Opposites.  its a cute dvd, but that i am sure she will enjoy more when she is a little older.  she is 14 months now.",1235779200,,343,3.9420289855072466

She let the doctor examine her without any problem! Of course she has also been playing with a doctor kit, so that probably helped too! It is a cute movie!",1232668800,,458,4.043956043956044

It has really helped them, anxiety-wise, and one of the girls is now completely obsessed with her toy doctor's kit! Coming from a doctor's family - and having been a very sick child myself - I have to say that I'm very pleased with this dvd and wish I'd had something like this when I was little.",1208131200,,461,4.133333333333334

2294871,4,B0009IWGHI,"After watching Elmo's Potty Time for about the 1 millionth time I purchased this movie for some variety for my two yr old and to save my sanity!  It's set up similar to the Potty Time movie, not like Elmo's world (which I can't stand because of that ridiculous drawer and window shade), with song and dance numbers and a variety of Sesame Street characters.  Pretty cute and it teaches about going to the doctor and the importance of taking your meds.",1200268800,,451,4.487804878048781

2294873,5,B0009IWGHI,"My twin boys are 12.5 months and we have most of the Elmo's World DVDs. If your kids like Elmo, and mine adore him, Elmo Visits the Doctor is one of the better DVDs to have. My boys LOVE this one. The first time I played this one, they sat there laughing out loud. Both of them get very excited when Elmo is shown and kick and laugh.

They especially enjoy the beginning song, which is sort of blues-like. There are other good songs, such as the song about being a patient. Plenty of the other muppets make appearances and this one has a good amount of Bert and Ernie, which is appreciated by all.

The program seeks to demystify visiting the doctor, hoping to make it less scary. The muppet physician tells his patients about finishing all of their medicine even once they start feeling better, reinforces the importance of having an adult administer the medication, and stresses that the role of a doctor is to help sick people (and animals) feel better. Elmo observes Baby Bear's examination and then has the courage to let the doctor listen to his heartbeat, check his ears and so on. After his exam is complete, Elmo is excited to get a sticker reward.

To sum it up, we really like this one and highly recommend it. Our boys' other favorites are: Food, Water & Exercise; Flowers, Bananas & more; Elmo Has Two; Sing Yourself Silly, Reach for the Sky; Pets; and The Great Outdoors. Hope that helps!",1188172800,,1402,4.490196078431373
2294874,5,B0009IWGHI,"This is a pretty good Elmo DVD. Not as good as Potty Time, better than Telling the Truth and way better than Guess that Shape. Bert and Ernie are really funny. All in all, well done and keeps my 22 month old occupied so I can load the dishwasher. I hope that it helps my daughter when she goes to her next doctor's visit. She can't stand that guy!",1178928000,2,347,4.043478260869565
2294875,5,B0009IWGHI,"Elmo visits the doctor explains the importance of telling a grown-up when you are not feeling well, taking your medicine until it is all gone, and only taking it when given to you by a grown-up (no matter how good it tastes.)  It also show that you do not need to be afraid to visit the doctor.  We have had this dvd since my daughter was one and she loves it.  She is also much calmer at the docotr's office now.  She allows the doctor to examine her without a fuss.",1177977600,9,467,4.0989010989010985
2294876,5,B0009IWGHI,My granddaughter loves this movie and she has renamed it to Elmo visits Dr. Mena because that is her doctors name. When she goes to the doctor she is not scared and she always tells her doctor how she is feeling. The DVD has been wonderful. She can watch this video everyday and each time she learns something new.,1168300800,,314,4.338983050847458
2294877,5,B0009IWGHI,"My 3-year old son loves this DVD. It's very cute and helps calm fears of going to the doctor. It features elmo who comes down with a sore throat and has to go to the doctor where he sees the other Sesame Street characters in the waiting room with other ailments. The characters are seen by the doctor, who listens to their heartbeat, checks their throat and does all the other ""scary"" things that your child's pediatrician does. Great for easing fears of the doctor by showing that the doctor is there to make them feel better. Many cute songs, and lots of Sesame Street puppets...We love this DVD and have no regrets in this purchase.",1168214400,9,635,4.482758620689655

2294879,5,B0009IWGHI,I think this DVD really helps any child feel more comfortable going to the doctor.  My two year old just loves the songs and Elmo of course but I'm sure he'll appreciate the message one day.  It's great for all ages.,1163376000,,216,4.2439024390243905

We got this video hoping to relieve some of her fears.  Right from the first time we watched it she loved it.  We watched it about once a day for a month straight.  She loves the songs and sings along.  Her favorite is the ""patient"" song.  We bought her a doctor kit in addition and her next visits to the doctor were a breeze!  It is a great video and really teaches kids alot.  She now know to cover her mouth when she coughs and sneezes and all about stethoscopes!",1143158400,,638,4.163934426229508
2294883,5,B0009IWGHI,"While Elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video, that is not the only good thing about this one.  It features several shorts with cartoons and different characters.  My favorite part of the video (and my daughter's) is the part featuring Ernie and Bert.  Ernie decides he is going to be a doctor, and needs Bert's help so he can practice doing the things doctors do.  Bert just wants to know if he is healthy, and after putting him through several tests, Ernie says that he doesn't know if Bert is healthy or not because he isn't a doctor-but he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not!  The cartoons are funny, and there is a never before seen Elmo's World at the end all about doctors, too.  Very cute!",1140048000,2,752,4.223776223776224

Unfortunately with Instant Video you can't buy it, only rent it, so I ended up buying the DVD because we rented it so many times. This has helped a little bit with her nervousness at the doctor. I wish it featured the dentist and optometrist, and explained the process of drawing blood or collecting urine because we have had issues with those things in the past and my friends with kids expressed the same feelings.

The songs and things are a bit annoying and Elmo's voice gets on my nerves but its worth it to not have to deal with tantrums over going to the doctor for a simple checkup.",1475107200,,647,4.391666666666667
