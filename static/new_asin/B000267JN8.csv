8022657,3,B000267JN8,Good for starters but I was corrected by a real boxer. Good workout though.,1385596800,,75,4.428571428571429
8022658,5,B000267JN8,"Love this workout! I am so hooked on his workouts. I bought this to use on the heavy bag, and wow, I've had to do this a couple weeks without the bag. The punch combos are fast. There is a lot of stuff on this DVD. Shadow boxing segment, mitt segment, medicine ball (for ABS)). And a quick jump rope workout. All of the boxing segments can be used on the heavy bag. I got this used here on Amazon. It was like band new. Even with shipping it was only $10 and totally worth it. It isn't long enough to use as a stand alone workout. But def awesome for a shorter workout or to add on to others.",1383350400,9,592,3.941666666666667
8022659,5,B000267JN8,I really enjoy working out to this video it trains you  properly in the art of boxing while giving you a high impact work out. The skills can be continually worked to fit your own boxing pattern to keep it interesting I also like the fact that there no strain on your knees and legs. Its also a work out you can do almost anywhere.,1370822400,10,331,4.092307692307692
8022660,4,B000267JN8,"I have been involved in martial arts for most of my life and trained seriously for a time in college.  But, then life happened, I got married had 3 kids and got fat.  Well that is pushing it, but at least major league out of shape.  I have been doing this workout on the VHS version for a while now.  Before all of these other so-called boxing/MMA workouts became available.  I have found that it gets my heart rate up and provides a challenging and motivating workout.  The combinations are advanced (e.g., not your typical ""one"",,,""three"",,,""four"").  He does a good job at explaining proper technique and positioning.  Though if your actually ""advanced"" you can likely skip over that.  Speaking of that, I don't think this is really ""advanced"", more like intermediate, but probably not for a true beginner (though not so hard that a beginner couldn't get it over time).

Overall, it works for me and I cycle it into my cardio routines and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for variety or an at home boxing workout routine.",1333584000,19,1037,4.648351648351649
