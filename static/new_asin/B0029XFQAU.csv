Before this set came out, the only way to adquire this series was to purchase the three volumes separtly for $2o a piece (vol 2 for $30 if ya get vol 2 with the box so you can fit all three volumes.) As far as fairness to the video games, it does lack in action. but its still worth a look. :o)",1254700800,2,469,3.9473684210526314

3882084,1,B0029XFQAU,"I would like to start off by re-itterating that this show is not at all like the video game. There is no action other than still shots and when there is any good action it is usually very short lived and not very satisfying at all. Its hard to write a review of any good length on such a shallow show. It turns the video game dant into a hapless, always poor individual who is always scraping for money by doing jobs in which he gets screwed out of getting paid for. The end of the show is even worse in which it has a big build up but the final battle is a complete let down. Very rarely in this show will you see the badass, yet cheesy as hell dante. The rest of the time your stuck with the typical japanese stereotype of a hapless hero who always gets screwed out of his money yet is still 'cool.'",1253059200,2,801,4.0125

REVIEW:
Devil May Cry is an anime adapted from a popular video game franchise that only augments its appeal with hard core edgy action, power house horror shoot'em ups and lethal women adding to the fan service and attraction of the animated series.

The story centers on Dante. He looks like a cross between a bounty hunter from a post apocalyptic film and a rock star. He's cool but also lazy, has a penchant for strawberry sundaes and spends what money comes his way on liquor and sweets. He may not seem in personality like a hard core killer of demons, but when the devils show up, he's all action with flippant one-liners and an irreverent attitude. He goes on one strange case after another that usually sees him by the end looking down a barrel of one of his big guns or whipping out his wicked sword to mete out bloody comeuppance on the evil carnage mongers he's set upon.

He's not alone in his adventures. He gains a sidekick, a pretty girl named Paddy with little skills but a loyal heart, much more eye-catching is the sexy Lady with her leather-punk looks, motorcycle mama attitude, and really, really big guns (she pulls out a bazooka at one point), and hardly least, there's Trish. She's a woman all in leather from head to toe and some mean skills to rival Dante's half-human/half-demon abilities. She also looks exactly like someone from Dante's past...

Don't expect a big plot line in DMC. The anime is an adrenaline pumped action horror with lots of guns blazing, sword slashing, and big explosive action. Most of the episodes are one shots dealing with whatever new case Dante is hired for. A particular one dealing with a cruise ship and a casino night where you bet your soul stands out. The more tragic tale of a rock and roller and a sold soul hits the angst hard. And comedy plus action meet with explosive results when the two women in Dante's life, Lady and Trish, meet face to face and have it out in fantastic style. By the end of the series the show has an arc where demons with a grudge against Dante's father come looking to take it out on the son. Dante has his hands full, the hordes of hell are rampaging all over the city and his friends try to fight the zombie and demon legions while Dante takes on the big bad guys in a fight to the finish.

The animation is produced by MADHOUSE who has done some of the most respected and memorable anime movies like Ninja Scroll and Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust. Most recently they worked on Highlander the animated film. Here in Devil May Cry, you get that same edgy feel and is near theatrical quality at times. The action is amazing to watch and has a wide range. There are gun fights, bazooka fights, explosions, bombs, car chases, sword duels, hellacious magic, possession, devils on earth and the undead. Rock and roll meets the macabre.  The women are femme fatales pin ups to the nth degree. The music is also all go with opening songs and scores that sound like Metallica meshed with Trans Siberian Orchestra. It's wicked cool all the way through.

3882094,4,B0029XFQAU,"Intro:
I am a longtime fan of the Devil May Cry video game series, I have been playing them since the first one came out and I was only ten years old. This is a must-have for any fan of the series, and a pretty good anime for those who have never played it before.

Animation: 3.5/5
The animation is slick and stylish, which fits the series well, but it is noticeable that this was not originally formatted for HD. That being said, it is still a pretty show. The characters' heads are almost comically small at times, although that may just be the design style more than poor animation. The demon design does lack some of the creativity of the games, falling more into typical anime demon styles. The fights are very well animated and some of the settings (especially for the final two episodes) are very cool.

Audio: 4/5
The soundtrack is great, especially the opening song. Very moody and fitting. The Dolby 5.1 track sounds fantastic and gives a near-perfect range of volume. I watched the dubbed version (listening to character I grew up with in Japanese is just wrong) and the voice acting is what you'd expect. Reuben Langdon reprises his role as Dante (under the name Justin Cause) and does a solid job. Some of his lines are corny, but that's because Dante loves cheesy one-liners. Some of the more dramatic lines fall a bit flat, mostly because Dante as a character has a hard time with anything serious. The rest of the cast does their jobs, but nothing overly terrible nor excellent.

Story: 4/5
Fans of the series may be a little disappointed that the story is disconnected from the games for the most part. But it's nice that the plot is completely self-contained so there aren't any loose ends for non-gamers. It is also nice that they give viewers a bit of backstory on characters for the non-gamer viewers (touching a bit on Sparda, Trish, etc.) and doesn't expect them to have prior knowledge. Each episode has it's own arc, but there are hints and pieces of the overarching story in most of the episodes. Dante goes through little character development, but his relationship to Patty as the series carries on and getting to see a bit of his soft side is great. I understand that no enemy gives him a big enough threat to necessitate it, but I was a little bit disappointed in the lack of Devil Trigger.

Overall: 4/5
I love Devil May Cry, but I also know that it is not a perfect experience. Fans and anime-lovers alike wouldn't feel robbed in this purchase, since it comes at a very reasonable price.",1406505600,,2520,4.556291390728477
3882095,4,B0029XFQAU,Got I real quick. Love the game. Stories are not so good but the animation is great and action packed,1405468800,,101,4.1

3882097,5,B0029XFQAU,"What's there to say? It's an anime about a Devil May Cry. It's got it's own story arc. You'll see familiar and unfamiliar characters. I enjoyed it. The DVD's themselves work fine and everything was undamaged upon arrival. They responded quickly to my first order of this DVD set getting lost in the mail and promptly sent me a new one (which made it to me, thank goodness!)",1383264000,,373,4.5
3882098,4,B0029XFQAU,Compared to to the video game the video game beats out the tv show its a ok series for fans of the video game series,1372464000,,116,3.68

3882104,5,B0029XFQAU,"I love the Devil may cry series.  I have all the games and even the manga.  This series plays like another chapter in Dantes story and is fun to watch. epic win.  (On a side note I will not be picking up the new Devil May Cry game, titled DMC, as it is not a real Devil May Cry game, but it's a lie.)",1359072000,,300,3.65625
3882105,5,B0029XFQAU,"The story is interesting but the anime not what I thought it was. It is basic. Very basic. The back drops to all the scenes are simple, not very detailed, and sometimes kind of blured out. I would borrow this from someone who already owns it. Don't waste your money on this.",1356652800,,274,4.288461538461538
3882106,4,B0029XFQAU,"I'm a long time fan of the game series and finally decided to check out the anime.  One thing I like about this series is it shows Dante in his day to day life as a devil hunter.  This is something the games don't touch upon too much.  Aside from the last few episodes, the series isn't one self-contained story like I expected it to be.  Instead, Dante's taking a new mission each episode, slaying demons and kicking ass.  Lady's more or less a recurring character, which is awesome.  Trish makes a few appearances as well.  One of the best episodes is when these two characters meet for the first time and get into a super-powered cat fight!  Also, the theme songs are really good.  The ending theme in particular is just plain gorgeous, one of my favorite things about this series.

One thing I don't like about this series is Dante's characterization.  In DMC 3, Dante's cocky and funny and outgoing.  In the anime, he just seems kinda bored.  Like he's on his period or something.  You could almost make a drinking game out of this.  Take a shot every time Dante sighs.  You'll be in rehab with Dr. Drew for alcoholism before you can finish the series.  Okay, I guess it's not THAT bad, but I like Dante best when he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

There's a running gag in this show that Dante really likes pizza.  This should be a good thing, but dude, they run that joke into the ground like you wouldn't believe.  Also, the action scenes left me wanting.  It's not that they're bad per se, but considering DMC 3 has some of the best action sequences I've ever seen anywhere, these just felt lackluster by comparison.  Of course, pretty much all these problems are absent in the last episode.  That episode's intense, dude.

Honestly, I enjoyed this anime, but I also feel it's strictly for the hardcore fans.  If you're not into the games, I seriously doubt you'll find anything of interest here.  If you're just a casual fan, you MIGHT like it, but you might also say, ""Eh, why should I care?""  Now if you're someone who really loves the characters, I think you'll enjoy it.  I just wish Dante was a little more....Dante.

One last thing I feel worth mentioning is the characters drink a brand of beer called Budweiner.  No seriously.  They never say it out loud, but you can see it on the cans.  They're drinking Budweiner.",1349568000,,2333,4.480952380952381
3882107,5,B0029XFQAU,ITS GREAT plus its smaller so i have more room in my shelf to get more dvds Devil May Cry  is one of my all time favorite anime and the game got me started on devil may cry so of course i had to have the anime,1349136000,,209,3.4468085106382977
3882108,4,B0029XFQAU,"Loved the series and the games, and massively enjoyed sitting with my wife to watch this series.  Dante is still the lovable, pizza munching, demon busting, broke, man of style from the games.  Support characters on the otherhand felt like they missed the mark.  The plot is good, though it takes almost the whole series to unfold.  Regardless, it feels true to what Devil May Cry is.",1349049600,,384,4.686567164179104
3882109,4,B0029XFQAU,"The show is awesome but it's missing one very important thing, Dante never devil triggers! I thought this show would be like the game where in tough times, Dante will need to show his true form and that's when he transforms himself to demon mode. I don't know why they didn't do that. They knew about it because they had Dante foes turn into Demon form, but not him.

I thought at the very end of the series that...okay, maybe, just maybe this will be the time, where he needs to transform because it looks like he needs MORE POWER!!!  Then, it happened!

Nothing!!!

Dante, just suddenly believes he can do it and kick the last guys butt like nothing. What??? He didn't need more power. He didn't need to do anything. All he needed was believe in himself and there you go, he wins like nothing. WTF?

This show would had got 5 stars, but is only 4 because I don't know why they didn't have Devil Trigger!!!",1338076800,,907,4.34319526627219
3882110,4,B0029XFQAU,"I enjoyed this adaptation of the series, and the characters were interesting enough to watch.  The plotlines would seem to build up to what would be an amazing fight between some super-demon and dante, only to disappoint and turn out that Dante would simply obliterate them without breaking a sweat.

Still worth watching, fights aside the series is very entertaining.",1329609600,,368,5.116666666666666
3882111,5,B0029XFQAU,"WARNING! Not recommended for any one scared of: swearing, animated blood, violence, or those who think every series needs a air-headed damsel in distress (this IS a warning, as this anime has a 'Lady' who is scarier then hell itself!).

It's been about 4-5 years now since I started playing any of the Devil may cry games, But by GOD*, the anime version is good! (*& I don't mean any sissy Greek/Norse gods either), & For those who are unfamiliar with Dante, here's a summery:
He's a 'professional' Demon hunter with A huge sword & 2 guns that never run out of lead.
Has a partner Devil Demon huntress (Trish), & a rival Huntress (Lady), whom he owes ... some 6+ digit amount to...
Has a strange love for Pizza & Strawberry sundaes...
He's extremely hot when not wearing a shirt. ;).... Anyways.....

1)Why is it good? 2)what edition is the most Stylish? Read on....

1)The PLOT:...(actually it's just 5 of my favorite episodes, but it's still something)....

The opening of the 1st episode, 'Devil May Cry', starts out seeing Dante going into a bar, ordering a strawberry sundae, & inquiring about rumored demon activity in the area... right around the place he entered actually. Sure enough, the bar-tender & his patrons are all demons, & a cool DMC style fight scene breaks out... & I haven't even gotten to the main plot yet!
Next day, back at his office, He gets a request to escort a young orphaned girl called Patty to a mansion so she can claim her lost inheritance, A simple job, so why are so many demons after her?

Ep. 5 'In Private'(AKA What every DMC fan should watch before wishing Dante was real & living in their neighborhood):
The horrid tale of a normal man's encounter with Dante, as seen from his vantage-point: He's trying to steal my girl!, He just took on the entire mafia!, He kills demons without even flinching!, He just lost more cash to some 'Lady' playing poker then I'll ever see after working 60 years! (Ok, I added that last one, so what?).
Although Dante isn't the main focus point, this is probably the best episode of the 12... or at least the funniest.

Ep. 4 'Rolling Thunder': this episode is actually about the first meeting of Lady & Trish. The episode mainly focuses on Lady, looking for a demon who controls lightning, & getting into one heck of a fight with Trish.

Ep. 9 'Death Poker' (Yes, that is a stupid name. Even so this was a pretty cool episode):
Lately the world's best card players are dropping like flies after loosing a mysterious figure known only as 'King'. Dante, in the course of accepting a job to find out why, somehow gets a invitation to a high class casino/cruise ship, where a poker tournament is being held. What hope does world's worst gambler have to keep from loosing long enough to find out who 'King' really is? Maybe you shouldn't bet on the outcome just yet...

& Ep. 8 'Once Upon A Time':... This is the most interesting of the 12 episodes, as it tells about something they won't even talk about in the games: Dante's Past. While lounging around his office one day, a man comes in & starts to refer to Dante as 'Anthony'. Anthony or 'Tony', is the name on Dante's twin guns, A name no one in Dante's current life even knew he went by, so how should this strange man know? The man claims to have known him & his mother way back from when he was a child, & he invites him over for a drink, to catch up on old times,& to 'clear' his & his mother's name of a nearly 20 year old crime... involving demons... Even if Dante isn't the right guy, It's up to him to get rid of any devils lurking around the town, or face a repeat of the disaster from 20 years before.

2)THE VERSIONS IT'S AVAILABLE ON, & what one is the best?:

Although my review is for the blu-ray, I also have the 3-volume standard DVD's (with 4 episodes each), & a nice Hong-Kong import copy(Fear not! Bootlegs are your friend!). All have the English & Japanese dubs, & subtitles, But comparing the visual quality & bonus content of the series on each of the versions I mentioned, here's my results:

Blu-ray, POSITIVES: 2-discs loaded with 12 episodes + more extras then Ebony & Ivory are loaded with lead, The picture & sound are great (but I don't see any difference then the normal DVD version).
DOWNSIDE: I have a older, 'small' screen TV... On the menu screen I have to squint or walk right up to the set to see what episode I want to play. But if your TV is bigger then you are, this probably won't effect you.

Standard 3 DVD Edition, POSITIVES: The sound & visuals are just as good as Blu-ray (I have a old TV, so there may be a difference with newer models). The menu screen has big lettering & episodes can be selected squint-free, even from a distance.
DOWNSIDE: I have to get up every 4 episodes & change the disc, There aren't as many DVD bonuses then on the collected version(s). Set takes up the space of 3 DVD cases instead of one... (But considering I bought the same series 3 times, this really isn't a issue).

The Import version, POSITIVES: All 12 episodes are on 1 disc, so I can happily sit in a brain-dead trance & not move most of the day during a Dante marathon, & it has cooler back cover art then all the other editions mentioned.
DOWNSIDES: The picture gets a bit fuzzy during the opening/ending themes, The DVD menu makes it hard to find the right episode, & there aren't any extras...(But it's the first set I bought, so I'm kinda nostalgic about it =)

Conclusion: Blu-ray wins for people who like lots of extras &/or want to see the entire cut scene collection from the 1st video game... without having to make it past that damn spider, Phantom.
The collection of 3 DVD's are the best choice for people with older TV sets, & they don't give a *Bleep* about extras.
& The Hong-kong Import is for people like me, who ran out of gift-cards & had to buy it from whatever Chinese import shop they can find... actually it was the ONLY place I could find the DMC series at (big retailers suck in Michigan).

Here ends my review Of the series & quality of the editions I own, So maybe it'll help you choose what edition you want to own!",1327017600,5,6098,4.408
3882112,4,B0029XFQAU,"1st get rid of the little girl! PLEASE! shes soooo annoying! also its kinda freaky why they always feel the need to put kid charicters in adult content, anyhow then add some bazongas and bums like witchblade [without all the mindnumbingly dull story] and more guns and more sex and violence and THEN youll have a show a man would want to watch... this is just weak tea with good style points... but its ok to watch and less of a rip off then all the other over priced anime..",1323907200,,475,4.288888888888889
3882113,4,B0029XFQAU,"The basic story is :""Cursed to live as both monster and man, Dante must spend his life fighting the demonic forces of darkness.

The wildly popular video game is now a series, and this time, there's no sympathy for the devil."" As it says in the product discription.

this is a action Anime and if you have played the Video games or Read the manga you know the story.

The action is rather Awesome and the fight sceans are to few. Personaly I think the could of put alot more into the action but it dose have its fair share.

The plot dose get Confusing but in the end dose come together, each episode seems to have its own plot.

The Voice acting is done okay but I have seen better.

There is alot of blood, Violance, and language with very little Nudity.

Bottom line if your a fan of Action Anime's, the DMC Games and/or Manga you should have a look at this one it is pleasing to the eye and will keep ya watching it a few times over. Do note this is made for Adults not for children so I do not recomend children watching this, How ever the Adults who enjoy Anime should!!!",1323388800,,1256,4.256302521008403
3882114,5,B0029XFQAU,"I love the Devil May Cry animated series. I got the whole DVD collection already but still buy the Bluray version because I love it so much.

The story is based on the Capcom video game Devil May Cry series but viewers don't need to play the game to enjoy the anime.  It is telling the adventures of a devil hunter Dante & his friends.  Each episode is short but sweet with awesome music & interesting story.

Dante is as cocky & stylish as ever in the anime but there are many episode will show his sensational side. All of the supporting characters are also well written & well developed. Viewer can easily feel the friendship & bonding between the characters as the story goes.  Fans of the Devil May Cry game will love the details of the anime; like the episode about Trish & Lady that will make all the fans smile.

I totally love this anime series; the only problem I can find in it is that it is way too short (20-25 minute episode with only 12 episodes). I wish Capcom will have the same production company to make another season of Devil May Cry anime, I will be the first one to buy it!",1322524800,,1096,4.2451923076923075

3882116,3,B0029XFQAU,"Devil May Cry is a truly beautifully created anime series that has very few flaws within it's story.

The main premise has been done to death by Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star.

Lazy or disinterested hero gets sucked into a story, beats down the bad guys and resumes life as normal because each episode can honestly stand alone.

For the comedic type, there is some dark/fun humor involved in the series but in the end, still lacks a bit for the elegance of the games UP TO  and NOT INCLUDING 4.",1315785600,,493,4.384615384615385

Since this is mainly what she likes, then it was unmistakable that she was going to love it. She enjoyed the crap out of this movie. As far as comparing it to other anime's though, it does stand up well on it's own especially if no one has ever heard of Devil May Cry. A great watch with some great action scenes and fairly good dark humor. Still, you should already have been expecting that if you're familiar with the franchise.",1312675200,,539,4.346534653465347
3882118,3,B0029XFQAU,"So, I just finished the whole series.  Storyline and artwork was great.  However, my main problem with this particular series was, in every episode, the fight scene either had to cut away, or would end in 15-30 seconds.  It's like the artists got lazy on fight scenes and worked around it. Don't get me wrong, I love a good story line.  But I'm pretty sure a lot of the anime fans out there love the fight scenes even more.  And that's what really bugged me about this purchase.  Potentially this anime could have been great.  Having played Devil May Cry, easily gives you an idea on how intense fight scenes should have gone in this anime.  Sadly, the fight scenes are pretty disappointing.  Disappointing enough for me to actually make a review about it.  Everything else was good though.",1312070400,,790,4.618705035971223
3882119,4,B0029XFQAU,The story was intriguing enough but wasn't very faithful to the game.  Also if you didn't know anything about the game you really don't get most of why this is a good series.,1301875200,,174,4.2727272727272725
3882120,5,B0029XFQAU,"Devil May Cry is a great anime and a great video game. Dante is the best, nobody can defeat him... yeah!! The animation is awesome, it has great scenes, enough blood, good fights. the only sad thing is that this anime only has few episodes, but i loved this anime.",1290816000,,264,4.3
3882121,4,B0029XFQAU,"I haven't play the games, so this will be only for the anime itself. It hasn't depth in the story and twists, is mission based episodes is well made & the characters are nice. I really like little Paty that makes Dante's life a ""little"" difficult :). While it is not in the top in some parts, I really liked it. It is small and nice action anime.",1288569600,,346,4.102941176470588
3882122,1,B0029XFQAU,"So a friend lent this to me promising that it was entertaining. I actually liked the first episode, but by the second one I was already bored out of my mind. The other two reviewers that gave it a one pretty much sum up how bad this series is. No need for me to keep stating the obvious.",1285718400,,287,3.9655172413793105
3882123,4,B0029XFQAU,"First and foremost, you do not necessarily have to like the video game series to enjoy this anime adaptation. It is a good shoot 'em up, kill all the demons, bloody and violent action/horror fest. Most of the episodes are self-contained, so you should not go into watching this series thinking it is going to be really linear. Of course, some of the episodes will be connected but the episodes are generally stand alone. Nonetheless, I would recommend this series to fans of action packed gore fests, supernatural/demonic/horror-related stuff, and of course, fans of the video game series.

On a side note, I found that the audio and video quality of this Blu-ray version was noticeably better than the DVD version and is a worthy upgrade, in my opinion.",1283817600,8,754,4.844961240310077
3882124,5,B0029XFQAU,The Devil May Cry anime was a great buy with fast shipping and over 300 minutes of demon killing action!,1280102400,,104,4.25
3882125,4,B0029XFQAU,"This is a pretty good anime. While the store is not that well done, the action scenes are pretty great. The overall quality of the bluray is also decent. The quality could have been a lot better. Sound is good but not perfect. I would recommend buying this only if your a fan of action anime and don't care too much about plot and character development because those aren't that well done in this anime.

The special features are basically devil may cry cut-scenes and music videos from the new game. Theres one directors video and another music video from the anime. I don't see any reason for buying this if you already own the anime on Dvd.",1268006400,4,643,4.4491525423728815
3882126,5,B0029XFQAU,I really enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. It made me laugh in several places and the action was pretty good. I would definitely suggest this one to anime fans who don't like long drawn out series.,1267401600,4,209,4.25
3882127,1,B0029XFQAU,"when i bought this i had way higher expectations... there was barley a plot, most of it made no sense.. it was like watching all filler episodes, you can tell they made this crap just to market the name and make money off it. it is not well thought out. i just wonder how can you go so wrong with this series? i watched the first episode in horror and with hope watched the rest, wasting hours of my life in the process.. do yourself a favor go get basilisk or something with more depth, story line and better fight scenes.. i wouldn't even waist 5 dollars on it",1262908800,6,562,4.165137614678899
3882128,3,B0029XFQAU,"I really like the Devil May Cry 1 & 3 PS2 games.  I especially like the puppets,bosses and environments.  As I never saw the series, I was hoping that the series would be similar to the games.  I've watched 2 episodes so far.  The series looks to be just an ordinary monster Japanese Anime.  No puppets, black cats, spiders, ...  I've also found that Blu Ray doesn't really enhance animation.  I have other Japanese animation DVDs and they look just as good.  But the price was cheap and I took a chance.",1261008000,,504,4.4021739130434785
3882129,5,B0029XFQAU,This DVD was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. Thank You for putting that huge smile on my husbands face.,1260835200,2,121,4.083333333333333
3882130,3,B0029XFQAU,"You can tell right off the bat that this is a series based off of a video game. Most of the episodes are very mission-oriented with complete storylines. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. The first few episodes drag on a bit since there is not much tying them together. As the series moves along though, some small subplots begin to emerge, and finally the last few episodes have an epic plot that are truly worthy of an anime.

The animation is quite good and so is the action. The characters are somewhat clich, but not really in a bad way. They provide a bit of backstory, but definitely could have dug a bit deeper. There are a lot of holes and a lot of character development left unexplored. Not that surprising for a short series though.",1258156800,3,751,4.326241134751773
3882131,5,B0029XFQAU,"Great series, a little slow to begin but most anime is that way.  Some really awesome animation, very detailed and the blu ray quality is top notch.  There is definitely an underlying plot that kept my interest throughout. Although not much of this plot is revealed, I was completely entertained and watched the whole thing in a day or two. Can't wait for more!",1257638400,3,361,4.625
3882132,5,B0029XFQAU,I bought this for my son on his 18th birthday and he loved it. He is very much into the video games of the same title and this tied in well with those video games. He loves it.,1257206400,3,176,3.6578947368421053
3882133,2,B0029XFQAU,"I had big hopes for this show even after the first couple episodes, but it never did deliver and it just all fell flat on its face. none of the story ever really makes sense and barely even tries to explain itself. its all just a discombobulated crap fest, and should not be viewed by fans of anime, or the video games. spend your money on better series not this one.",1256688000,5,367,4.183098591549296
3882134,2,B0029XFQAU,"What do you do when there are too many bad things to list about something?  Start from the beginning.  I saw the first episode on demand; Dante protects a little blonde girl from some nasty demons in an heir dispute;  I thought: sweet, Dante, the demon killer for hire, sign me up.  So i bought the series; but to my dismay, and even horror, the little girl became a main character.  HEY EVERYBODY!!  LETS SEE WHAT KIND OF KOOKY THINGS HAPPEN WHEN WE PAIR UP A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL AND A HALF BLOOD DEMON PRINCE TO VANQUISH THE FORCES OF EVIL!  She doesn't go away, and she's accompanied by a cast of shallow characters who's presence make her seem less ridiculously out of place.  Goofy looking demon goons arrive, then what is supposed to be action in sues; still frames like in berserk, but its ten years later, there are demons, and no story this time around with Dante in a soda bar, eating ice cream Sundays for ten minutes an episode.  I feel violated by this definite money maker, intentional flop.  With a guilty conscious i sold this stinker to an innocent hopeful like i was once, and I would have posted ""selling because the show sucks, but plays great"" in the condition notes but i needed the money.

8358497,4,B0029XFQAU,"You might like it you might not like it Dante is a character whose personality changes just like a human who actually goes through character development.

Most of the original cast save for the DMC 3 and 4 dante voice actor are gone the show is more realistic then it is action game based, it's cannon and it's mostly well though out with a few weird outfits here and there on non-essential characters.

It's alot of good times but don't expect dante to act as if he's in 3 or 4 unfortunately capcom in-house writing and character logic is practically non coherent for the DMC hero, let's not forget the original team who made most of the characters and original story left the company.

BUT if you can get passed that or if you never played it you'll find interest in giving this series a once over",1431820800,,799,4.421768707482993
