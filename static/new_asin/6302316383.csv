Most animation fests will take stuff from a slim time period, but this one seems to range from about '76-86, and has stuff I've never seen anywhere else.  The work here is really art and isn't as gimmicky in the way that Spike and Mike fests tend to be.  Fascinating, beautiful, sometimes dated but in a way which lends itself to the psychedelic experience-- the phased sound and film grain makes it feel like you're really going back in time, sitting in a real midnight-movie house in New York in 1978.  Best stuff:  ""Delivery Man"" by Emily Hubley (who did the animation for 'Hedwig and the angry Inch'), ""Parataxis"", ""Ace of Light"", and the final short with 2-d characters is phenomenal.  I suspect this will never be released on DVD, so if you can get access to it, by all means see it.",1236211200,,978,4.56

7825020,5,6302316383,"This compilation of short animated works is an extremely good grouping.  The very first one will have you laughing like a little kid.  From then on you are hooked and become eager for more.  I remember the very first time my friends and I watched this movie.  We lost our minds!  Each film had its own way of altering your life forever.  The box warns against drugs while watching AFT.  But the video is the drug, it is maddening.",1091750400,,430,4.367088607594937
7825021,4,6302316383,"This is an extremely fascinating compilation of short films that are psychedelic, absurd, and very bizarre. After each short film, you will find yourself asking, ""What exactly was the meaning of that one?"" You will find that question difficult to answer each time. Many of the films may remind you of your dreams or strange poetry. The movie is a very interesting journey to the other side of the concept of reality.",1035590400,,416,4.791666666666667
