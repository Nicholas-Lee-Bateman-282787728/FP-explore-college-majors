8520731,5,B007PVHATQ,"I don't care what anyone else says, Chop Kick Panda is one of the funnies low-budget cartoons I have ever seen. The jokes are just so clever! Yeah, the animation is sub-par, but it's not hideous. But man, these characters sure do crack some pretty snappy one-liners. Puss In Boots was ok, Tappy Toes has a couple funny moments, but the Frog Prince is not so good. But that's ok! You have Chop Kick Panda to make it all better!",1426204800,,426,4.3375
