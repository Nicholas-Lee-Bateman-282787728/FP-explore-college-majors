8082486,3,B000B6KRDI,I have almost all Patrick's workouts and absolutely love them.  I didn't care for this one as much because he uses way less time teaching the moves and does not explain them as much as his other workouts.  I didn't care for the teaching segment that only shows him from the back with just counting and no description of the moves he's doing.  Not his best taught workout DVD in my opinion.,1410220800,,389,4.375
8082487,2,B000B6KRDI,Quality not good. It may old.,1405814400,,29,4.0
8082488,1,B000B6KRDI,hated this. this is not a hip hop aerobic workout. more like ballet. didn't even hear any hip hop songs. truly regretted buying it.,1385510400,,131,4.5
8082489,1,B000B6KRDI,"I have purchased two of Patrick's DVDs and I won't buy anymore. His workouts are too difficult for me. This DVD is for people with advanced experience with choreography. I LOVE dance aerobics dvds, but this routine is almost like something a cheer squad would do (he has 2 Laker girls with him). Patrick doesn't break the moves down enough to actully learn them before all of the moves are put together. Unless you're an advanced dancer (you almost need professional experience) don't bother with this workout.",1300233600,,510,4.873563218390805
8082490,3,B000B6KRDI,"I first saw Patrick Goudeau on Fitness TV and fell in love with his style. He is such an energetic instructor. I got the ""Having a Ball with ABC,"" and ""Dumb Training"" DVDs and loved so much that I decided to get the Dance Remix and Dance Moves.

I'm not an aerobics, choreography type of person. I have such a hard time trying to follow those 80's style aerobics' class that screams grapevine to the left, grapevine to the right. The DVD was very good, but it wasn't for me. I rather stand in place and hold a dumbbell. So for those people that are not very well coordinated, this would not be for you. But for others that are looking for some fun cardio, this would be a good choice.",1266019200,,684,4.221374045801527
8082491,5,B000B6KRDI,"Patrick Goudeau is known for his advanced choreography, his unique routines, and his laugh.  All of these were in this routine.  The first time I played it, it was very difficult to continue the routine past the 5th or 6th 8-count.  However, the next time I tried it, I got the routine almost perfectly.  Patrick teaches this routine by slowing the 8-count to half-time, teaching 2-3 times, then going tempo before doing the same with the next 8-count. . .sometimes the next 2!  It's great for advanced exercisers, but don't do it if you can't handle a really bubbly instructor.  Patrick constantly cracks jokes and laughs at everything with his unique little laugh.  I love it, as I find it makes him more fun, but others might find it like nails on a chalkboard.  The routine is 16 8-counts, so it is really quite long.  There is everything from disco to Latin to African to hip-hop and it is a blast.  The transitions are seamless, but like me, don't expect to get the routine down the first or second time you do it.  Give it time and it will come.  A fun, high cardio workout that will keep anyone coming back for more!",1260576000,5,1124,4.482758620689655
8082492,5,B000B6KRDI,"I love this DVD though I will say for me it is a workout just to learn the choreography.  I thought it would be dance driven aerobics but it is more like learning a dance routine.  The first go through I had a tough time following but worked up a sweat just trying to keep up.  To my surprise the second time I actually picked up some of the steps. Plus it is fun and I love Patrick as an instructor, he's upbeat and keeps you motivated.  Time flies when you do this DVD and that is a good thing!!  I'll be buying some of his others to try.",1150761600,12,540,3.9174311926605503
8082493,5,B000B6KRDI,"This workout is so much fun.  It really feels like I am in a dance class.  This workout is not quite as hard as Dance Moves but still just as dancy.  The choreography is complex but he breaks it down and has a bonus section to review the choreography slowly if you need it.  I love Patrick's workouts and highly recommend this if you love to dance.  This is not a cheesy aerobic video! Also, Patrick has great energy and will have you laughing along with him.  Buy it!!",1137024000,15,469,4.213483146067416
