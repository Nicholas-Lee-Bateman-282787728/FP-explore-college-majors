8275481,5,B0019X423I,"This is an important insight into Toots Thielemans and his work ethic.  I met him twice and had a few letters from him from Long Island before he went back to Belgium.  His advice to the students was very important, in that he pushed for More practice and more Energy in their work.  He inspired me to be more expressive in my harmonica performances.  God Bless Toots !",1418428800,2,369,4.382352941176471

8275483,5,B0019X423I,"I've bought and enjoyed a half dozen of the Jazz at NYU Master Class series of DVDs so far, and have enjoyed them all. This two-DVD set is no exception. All feature a live performance by a senior jazz giant, extensive interaction of that guest artist with student musicians, a biographical introduction by jazz writer Gary Giddins, and an interview conducted by Giddins with the guest.

Clark Terry is a giant of jazz, and at age 84 (in 2004), was still playing surprisingly well when this program was produced. As an added bonus, Clark is in the company of a first class rhythm section -- pianist Kenny Werner, bassist Mike Richmond, and drummer Billy Hart. Picture quality is excellent and the overall video direction is fine for what is a fairly low budget production. Sadly, I can't say the same for the sound mix, which has Clark's horn sort of off-mic (echoey sounding) some of the time, and, thanks to a ""rock and roll"" style of drum miking, misses half of Hart's drum kit.

An important part of these Master Class DVDs is the interaction of the Master artist with students. As with other guests in the series, it is both heart-warming and illuminating to watch Clark's great willingness to share his musical philosophy, knowledge, and experience with the students. Not only do we witness first hand the jazz tradition of ""passing it on,"" but we also, as non-musicians, gain greater understanding of what's going on up on stage when we're listening to jazz.",1323302400,3,1464,4.75984251968504
8275484,4,B0019X423I,"I really enjoy all of the DVDs in the Jazz Master Class series, and this one featuring composer, arranger, and saxophonist Jimmy Heath is no exception. There's some of Jimmy's playing, some playing by students, and lots of great interaction with Jimmy and the students. Sound and picture quality are excellent.",1322438400,,310,5.098039215686274
8275485,5,B0019X423I,"Any opportunity to see and hear a universally acclaimed jazz legend talk about his craft is like finding a rare gem, especially when the artist is of the caliber of Phil Woods. He's been there, he's done it, he's played with a who's who of jazz icons throughout his career and has established the benchmark for jazz alto saxophone post Bird. He is a consummate musician who is well schooled in a wide range of musical styles and is not shy about sharing his views on his career, the music industry and other interesting subject matter. It is also very interesting to hear his comments as he listens to three amateur groups and passes on valuable advice about their performances. And we get to hear him play some duo jazz that showcases his extraordinary talent and musicality. Highly recommended for jazz players, educators and jazz fans who want to understand more about the motivation, dedication to his craft and humor of one of this nations finest creative artists.",1226361600,4,969,4.773809523809524
