883021,5,6304458657,"Martial arts mayhem, with a touch of humor in the tradition of the Shaw Brothers productions, but produced by Golden Harvest studios.  Themes include honor, loyalty, betrayal and subterfuge.  Much better production than the Jackie Chan films from the same time period.
Last Hurrah for Chivalry is even better in DVD.  This widesrceen production is a ""10"" in terms of picture quality! The Mandarin dubbed version of the movie is especially good.  Excellent color and focus are good adjectives to describe the video portion.  I believe the video has been reworked, because for a film that was originally released in 1979 the video still seems fresh.
The audio quality is equal to the task.  The producers have spared no expense and have transfer the original soundtrack recording to Dolby Digital 5.1.  I assume it was remastered to make the conversion, because it doesn't say so on the box.  Not many studios now adays will go to such expense to update a movie over 20 years old.
By the way this DVD has the original Cantonese version with English subtitles, or you can watch the film dubbed in English or Mandarin, with a choice of English, simplified or traditional Chinese subtitles.
I have the original video of the film as well and noticed the English translation is some instances is different than the DVD, but the video quality on the DVD just blows the video away.  If you have a DVD player...get the DVD... You won't be disappointed.
This is my favorite John Woo film.  It's better than the latest films he has produced here for the US market, including Broken Arrow etc..",971654400,14,1581,4.779411764705882

883220,4,6304458657,"Actually enjoyed this movie. Read several of the other reviews, but have always been a fan of 'Saturday Morning Kung Fu', a weekly show when I grew up that featured many good movies and some bad ones too. This would rank in the upper echelon of those movies. Good story, surpirse ending that caught me off guard. Liked it, except for the fact that the main whiney antagonist, who's family was killed by the main bad-ass antagonist, was supposed to be nowhere near as good, and had to get the two protagonists who were to kill for him. They killed the main bad-ass, but then Whiney kicked their asses all over the place, thanks to some magical sword. What? No way, especially when throughout the movie Whiney gets his ass handed to him all the time. I so wanted Whiney to have been killed, and he was, in what was the best chop-socky buddy movie I have seen in a while. Still, I really thought it would end a little differently, and this movie had many surprises. Yes, the action was scripted. Duh. But it was still good stuff, and worth the watch. If you grew up watching stuff like this, like I did, then you will know what I am talking about- this movie would have been in my top list as a kid, and honestly still will be.",1393804800,,1224,4.326086956521739

883276,4,6304458657,"Not the best in any sense, it's still a kick to see this early John Woo wuxia, and with good performances throughout. The showdown between Pray and Chang is one of the most fun swordfights I've seen - nice choreography. Wai Pak's moves here seem a lot more polished and confident that they did during his time at Shaw Bros.

The movie switches between dark and serious, to comedy, to tear-jerker fairly frequently, but it gets more right than it does wrong. Throw in a good twist near the end (""That's one hell of a move"") and you have a movie that while not necessarily a classic, is enjoyable and worth repeat viewings. If you have someone you're trying to introduce to 70's kung-fu/wuxia, this would be a decent place to start - It's distinctively Woo-esque and therefore has a more modern flavor than some.

It's a 3.5 star movie, but that's not an option and the extras are good stuff, so, what the hell, we'll go four stars.",1352073600,,930,4.497041420118343
883277,5,6304458657,"An early example of John Woo's themes of brotherhood and honor, this time in a period setting featuring swords instead of guns. A 1978 release with lots of twists and turns in the plot and bloody swordplay action in the tradition of Woo's mentor, Chang Cheh. These themes laid the groundwork for Woo's successful film a Better Tomorrow and subsequent films. DVD: includes a new Dolby Digital cantonese track, and the original mono cantonese track. I go for the mono track because the music and sound effects are changed on the dolby track.",1351814400,,539,4.806451612903226
883278,5,6304458657,A great kung fu buddy movie both the lead guys are cool. Nice to see a lot of Chinese sword forms. Also the sleeping style guy is worth the price of admission.

Woo is excellent I think this is one of his first!,1341532800,,331,3.9696969696969697
883279,5,6304458657,"This movie comes from the Director of HARD BOILED and THE KILLER. A Kung Fu cinema review summarises it as follows, ""A superior swordplay extravaganza"". And according to Eleanor Manikka from All Movie Guide, it is full with ""Dazzling fight sequences"". Before launching to international fame with THE KILLER and HARD BOILED, John Woo proved his mastery of action direction with LAST HURRAH FOR CHIVALRY. Loaded with brilliantly choreographed action action sequences that would become Woo's trademark, the sword fighting saga of honor and loyalty is ""a near flawless pic"" (Kung Fu Cinema). Two master swordsmen agree to help a desperate man avenge his family's murder, only to discover that they may be pawns in a larger, more treacherous plot. The twisting story, fascinating characters, and sensational battle scenes combine to make this film an essential martial arts classic.",1255392000,,877,5.316546762589928

883281,1,6304458657,THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO WATCH IN YEARS. TERRIBLE ACTING. HORRIBLE PLOT. BAD MUSIC. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME. I PURCHASED IT BASED ON READING REVIEWS.

883283,3,6304458657,This movie starts off a little slow and has an interesting story line though. Sometimes kung fu movies will not have much action and the storyline won't be interesting but this one is. There is an excellent sword fight in the middle of the movie and to me is the best fight in the whole film. The movie drags on near the end and doesnt seem to end the final fight is a bit of a let down. The villian at the end doesnt seem to bring any excitement to the fights and is kind of boring to watch. He is one of those villians you just want to watch die very quickly so the movie will end. Some villains in other movies are so cool you kind of want them to have a good showdown with the hero/heroes but not the villian in this movie. I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars b/c it wasn't awesome but it wasn't horrible either. The only reason why i picked this movie up was to see Venoms (#2 snake) in this movie.,1231718400,2,902,3.9615384615384617
883284,2,6304458657,"This film though not unentertaining, seemed like a chop-socky movie with swords and blood.  The choreography feels staged rather than natural.  The swords don't look realistic.",1231372800,,176,5.730769230769231
883353,5,6304458657,"As this classic opens, we find a couple of characters in vastly different positions.  With one being a drunk, assasin for hire that has no morals at all.  Add in a little bit of romance that is rebuffed repeatedly by the would be assassin and the woman who longs for his affection.  Then we have another that's more into doing his own thing but is very well known for his martial arts skills.  There's a 3rd party that plays pretty prominently in this film as well.  It seems that his intentions are good when he tries to hire the skilled martial arts fighter.  Its over revenge for his family that were killed.

Its what we are led to believe at least.  I won't give out what it's really over.  But i must say that i didn't see that one coming at all.  For a film of this age, it transfers well as things are bright and lively.  The colors and backgrounds are well done and of course the fighting is very well done. 2 on 1, 1 on 1, several on 1.  Its pretty much all covered in this flick that should be added to everyone's DVD collection as soon as possible.  Your able to watch this in Cantonese or English.  I prefer the original language and reading the subtitles.  It has more of an effect for me.

""Last Hurrah for Chivalry"" is one film that holds your attention throughout.",1224892800,2,1281,4.275
883354,5,6304458657,"My reviews basically state if the movie is worth buying or not. This movie in my opinion is one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time. It has a great storyline,many great characters(who all can fight),and great fighting scenes. All make up a great kung fu movie. I rank it up there with Fearless as one of the best.

Another quality this has is even the stars rather good or bad take hits. I hate kung fu movies where the stars barely get touched. I loved 36 chambers but I wouldnt give it a 5 because after he learned shaolin kung fu they made him look invincible. No one even barely landed a blow and they all were supposed to be great fighters. In real fighting both fighters take blows,the question is who lands the most fatal blow.

I can watch this movie a thousand times and won't get tired of it. Really a sad ending though but this is a must see. Dont hesitate. I copped this bad boy on tape for 1 cent and that was the most valueable buy in my life.",1217376000,3,964,4.149732620320855
883355,5,6304458657,"LHfC is a great movie.  Since it's a Dragon Dynasty release it means that the picture is as good as you're going to  find on anything this old.  The audio is flawless.  Of course, the presentation of the menus and extras is top-notch.

The biggest point I'd like to make is that John Woo not only directed this film, he also wrote it.  He hasn't done much in the way of writing when it comes to his US films.  But back in HK, he wrote just about every one of his major films.  To me, that makes this film all the better.  If you are a Woo fan, but have somehow missed this, you'll love it.  It is trademark Woo.

2 friends who fight side by side-check.  Slo-mo combined with slick choreography-check.  Slick moving camera that takes on a life of its own-check.  Sense of epic and grandeur-check.  Doves flying just prior to a major action scene-che. . .OK, so it doesn't have ALL the Woo trademarks.  But most of them.

The story is very solid and takes some turns to keep it from being just standard action fare.  If you enjoy Kung Fu flicks, this one is excellent.  While it's not Crouching Tiger or Hero and isn't loaded with wire-fu.  It is definitely the predecessor of these films and is most enjoyable, even by today's standards.

I really thought I would have to lower my expectations a bit since it was an older film that would primarily have the 'rhythmic' kung fu you could set a metronome to.  But even that played out well, and more creatively than I would have thought.  There's a ton of action, the characters are fun and have some dimension, the story flows well and is creative, and it's just a good movie.  Any fan of martial arts flicks should more than easily be able to enjoy this one.",1216339200,2,1706,4.3428571428571425
883356,5,6304458657,"From the director of Hard Boiled and The Killer comes this dazzling, brilliant, flawless Kung Fu flick called ""Last Hurrah For Chivalry"". The one thing that stands out from everything else is the acting and the fighting. Damian Lau and Wei pai take not only the sword fights to another level but also a brilliant team of acting. I loved how they combined the sword fights with hand to hand combat, the transitions between the two were awesome!. I was amazed with every minute of this film. If you don't have this yet, get it right now! Dragon Dynasty is one of the best places to get your martial arts films, classics and modern kung fu flicks. Don't miss this one!

883357,5,6304458657,"This is a great flick, you can watch it 2 ways, with the subtitles only and Chinese, or the English version.

What does that mean? well you will see the english dubbed version makes it feel like a ""buddy movie"" like ""Lethal Weapon"" aks -- pretty funny quips and good translations. The subtitled (real) version is much more straight foward and not funny. Either way this is really a ""must have"" for any collector!

883358,4,6304458657,"I had been waiting to see this film for a while, so when I started watching and the first fight scene was painfully slow (even for the late 70's), I prepared myself for disappointment.  Luckily for me, disappointment was no longer on the menu.  What was, you ask?  Wei Pai (Snake, of ""5 Deadly Venoms"") playing a nice guy, beautiful picture quality, and sword-fights that just kept gettin' better.  The latter fights are far from the best ever, but they are still a lot of fun to watch.

The story is okay, nothing too fancy; a man's new wife and a lot of his clan are wiped out by a rival (Lee Hoi San, of ""everything"" fame), so he looks for fighters to help dispense some justice.  Wei Pai and Damian Lau play the swordsmen in question, befriended by the widower, prior to their revenge-soaked undertaking.  Pretty cool stuff.  Though I really could have done without the ""sleeping sword"".  I dislike when a movie that keeps the sense of humor to a minimum suddenly breaks into something ridiculous.  I certainly can't criticize creativity, it just kind of interrupts the flow.

An early film on the resume of John Woo, it has his trademark violence, deception and male-bonding.  I love how dudes in his movies become friends by meeting and simply suggesting that they become friends.  Usually, that only happens at 3am in the laundromat between weirdos, who recently consumed a quart of whiskey, each.

Dragon Dynasty does it again with this marvelous release, with plenty of special features.  This looks just like a Shaw Brothers production with its lavish sets and costumes, but was actually done by Golden Harvest.  The picture quality is fantastic.  Recommended.

883359,5,6304458657,"Review of the widescreen edition of Dragon Dynasty release of ""Last Hurrah for Chivalry"".  This is an early John Woo directed movie, where he just joined the Golden Harvest studio.

  The movies starts off with a wedding, with Mr. Kao marrying the local concubine.  When asked why he married a whore, he replies: "" I did it for the publicity"". Classic !  The wedding party is interrupted by local rivals led by the nefarious  Pai (played by Lee Hui-Son).  Pai and his crew slaughter everyone, but Mr, Kao escapes. As he recovers, Mr, Kao is looking for martial artists to recruit to avenge his and his families honor.  He encounters Chang of the Magic Sword (played by Wei Pai), who later befriends Green the Assassin (Daiman Lau).  Kao recruits Chang to help him defeat Pai, and along the way Green decides to help Chang. During this time, Pray (Fung Hak-On) comes to challenge Chang as the best swordsman in the area.  There is a great duel in the country between the two.  After Chang defeats Pray, he and Green go to Pai's villa to defeat him.  There are some great martial arts, but the best is Chang and Green versus the Sleeping Wizard(Chien Yuet San).  Awesome swordsplay, martial arts, and comedy thrown in for good measure!

 I really enjoyed the martial arts choreography.  There are some great duels not only with kung fu, but various types of martial arts weapons.  Pray, one of the villains, was actually also the action choreographer of the movie.  There are some great twists in the plot, as another reviewer already mentioned.  I saw one coming, but it turned out opposite of what I thought!  There is some great comedic interaction between the various parties, including Green and Chang, and then in the battle of Green, Chang, and the Sleeping Wizard!

 Some of the extra's on the DVD include:

* Commentary of the film by Kung Fu Cinema Expert Bey Logan.

* Pray For Death: Interview with Fung Hak-On.
 Fung was Pray in the movie, who as I mentioned before was also the action choreographer on the film.  He relates who he and John Woo made the transition to Golden Harvest Studios, and their relationship as friends.

* Deliver Us From Evil: An Interview with Lee Hui-San
 Lee was Pai, the evil martial artist in the film.  He is very entertaining as he describes how the movie was made and the various actors in the film.

* Legendary Weapons of China Featurette
 This small documentary was very informational.  One of the best extra's I have seen in a martial arts movie. Bey Logan talks about the various weapons used in the martial arts movies.  Excellent!

*  There is also an Original Theatrical trailer, plus there are 4 trailers at the beginning of the film for some Dragon Dynasty releases.

Once again, another great Martial Arts movie, re-released by Dragon Dynasty!  Highly Recommended for any Kung Fu library!",1193529600,,2843,4.703252032520325

883361,5,6304458657,"Thank you John Woo for directing this, one of my favorite films of this era in kung fu cinema(or any era really).  One of the things that puts this film so high on my list is the great characters and how interesting and unique they are.  Even the characters with less screen time shine here nearly as bright as the stars of the film themselves.  The assasin Pray for instance, has fantastic presence in all of his scenes and has the best fight scene in the film when he battles Chang to the death (my opinion of course).  Characters, plot, action, choreography, twists, humor... it's all here and I can't recommend this film enough (not to mention 30 of the last 40 minutes is non-stop action!).  Dragon Dynasty as per usual gives it all the respect it deserves with top notch picture, sound, and special features.",1188864000,,814,4.5479452054794525
883362,5,6304458657,"I have seen Wei Pai in three of the Shaw brothers martial arts films and i never knew how much they down played his skills until i saw Last Hurrah for Chivalry. His character is so likable (which is a change from the characters that he played in the Shaw brothers films..although i liked every character that he played) and he such a skilled fighter. Not to mention that he is sooo adorably cute.....(the guys reading this aren't going to care about that comment, but i just had to add it).  Damian Lau's character (Green suit) is a great compliment to Wei Pai's character Chang Sam. His sword play and sense of humor are great. Also the friendship between the two is very touching. I'm not a big fan of John Woo's movies but this one is by far a great one. And growing up on movies such as the kid with the golden arm and 5 deadly venoms, i know what a good martial arts film looks like. :) When i first got my DVD i watched it 2 times back to back. it was just that good. I watched the English Dub and also watched it in english subtitles. Both are very good.

Good plot, great costumes, an overly suggestive & touching relationship between 2 attractive guys, almost no crappy special effects at all, it's really ammusing at times, & the dubb is actually good,which is in itself a miracle.
Other reccomendations:
*Twin Warriors (Jet Li)
*Curse of the Undead Youma (aka Blood Reign)<anime>",1085011200,,399,4.970149253731344
883426,5,6304458657,"It's not just another Kung Fu flick.  It's John Woo.  The stars are the familiar cast of old school Action / Black Belt / Kung Fu Theater shows, but the plot and cinematography are uniquely John Woo.  The movie is a must for Kung Fu fans.  The swordplay in the movie is not as fluid as in the 90's Kung Fu movies, but the movie still stands out as one of the all time greatest sword-fighting movies.  Another, movie I would highly recommend is the Kid With the Golden Arms.",1055894400,4,473,4.211111111111111
883427,4,6304458657,"Last Hurrah for Chivalry, despite its cheesy English title, is important for two things:  One, it broke new ground in period martial-arts films by its use of contemporary language and attitudes; two, it introduces many quintessential John Woo stylistic conceits, thematic elements, and cinematic devices.
The anachronistic speech patterns and occasionally bad humour are not to everybody's taste.  However, what it does achieve for the film is a sense of intimacy for the characters missing from Woo's previous films, such as Hand of Death.  The use of the Cantonese language brings Last Hurrah for Chivalry down to an earthy level, allowing the actors to loosen up.  In the case of Wei Pai and Liu Sung Yen, this is really a good thing, freeing them up to express their characters better.
Woo's signatures begin to emerge very clearly in this film.  The characters of Cheung the Third and Green Robe are really precursors to character pairings in later Woo films such as Jeff and Eagle Lee (The Killer), Potcake and Jim (Once a Thief), and most important, Ho and Mark/Ken from the A Better Tomorrow series.  Just the interplay between Wei and Liu along is worth the whole film, Wei's earnest naivete and Liu's engrossing mix of drunken clowning and deadly silence making for some of the best character interactions in the Woo oeuvre, rivalling that of Chow Yun-fat and Ti Lung in A Better Tomorrow.  The over-the-top sound design and hair-raising fight choreography give the fight sequences a real sense of danger, while the themes of honour, betrayal, despair and fate are lifted intact and incorporated into the Killer, right down the the ending.
In fact, the only fault of this film is its moments of crude humour, usually thanks to bad bit players (eg. the henchmen of the villain Bai Zhong Tang).  Still, Last Hurrah for Chivalry is one of Woo's best early films.",1023235200,3,1869,4.911111111111111
883428,5,6304458657,"John Woo has a unique style, which you can check in this 1979 film, long time before Face/Off or MI2. The film has an excellent plot, with classical honor conflicts and friendship, and lots of action, with scenes that make Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon look older...
The DVD edition has good picture quality and the sound is excellent, with Dolby Digital (rare for a 20 years old film!).
If you like HK cinema, this is a must for your collection.",1002672000,,447,4.6
883429,5,6304458657,"Amongst the people I know who like martial arts films, there exist several sub categories. Those who like hand-to-hand, those who like weapon fights, those who like mystical touches, those who want continuous fighting - some strange people even enjoy the plot! This film caters for all categories. The characters are rich, the dialogue comprehensible, the choreography exceptionable. Many of the fight scenes have the quality of a films climax to them. One scene in particular (The sword fight with Prey) still sends goosebumps down my spine. If you only buy one Martial arts film, forget Enter the Dragon, buy Last Hurrah for Chivalry.",989625600,,636,5.125

883431,5,6304458657,"Last Hurrah for Chivalry is one of the best martial arts movie I've ever seen. We can see John Woo' style in many of the scenes (slow motion action scenes) and themes (friendship and adversity). Once again, Wei Pai (the snake in 5 Deadly Venoms) shows his great skills in martial arts, as well as Liu Sung Yen (Green Suit). The story itself is classic but above average. The action sequences are many and quite amazing.
The quality of the DVD is rather surprising for a 1979 Hong-Kong movie. The sound is OK, but what really shines is the picture. While not perfect (some scratches appear from time to time), it's still clear and sharp.
Overall, this movie is definitely a must-see.",980380800,2,682,4.598360655737705
