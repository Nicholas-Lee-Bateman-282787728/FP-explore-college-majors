8345683,2,B001V7UX58,"This video`s main story is about the Bunny Ollie`s slumber party and he is having a hard time falling asleep...the duck Ming Ming gets overly upset repeatedly and kinda yells at him...I don't think this is cute or funny and my toddler (after watching it twice) yelled at the baby like the Duck did to the bunny instead of the traditional...don't cry baby go to sleep as he would say before...needless to say, this dvd is no longer played in my house. Not a very educational or positive movie for small children who like to copy. I would however recommend blues clues (with Steve)",1402444800,,579,4.576923076923077
8345684,5,B001V7UX58,My kids love this DVD!  Wonder Pets items are so hard to fine now and having this we can take any where instead of just DVRing the shows that are on Nick Jr. at night.,1390608000,,167,3.7714285714285714
8345685,3,B001V7UX58,"My kids love all of the Wonder Pets DVDs that we have. I like most of them, too, but I don't like the episodes with Ollie in them.  Ollie is self centered, and Ming Ming is not very nice in them either, showing no patience whatsoever.  I like my kids to watch movies that teach some sort of positive lesson, and usually Wonder Pets do that. This time it is teaching selfishness and intolerance.  If I had known, I would have passed.  If you don't mind the attitudes, and are just looking for something to keep them busy and make them laugh, this one does the job as well as any of the others.  :)

(I have been bashed in the past for posting a review based on my ""Moral Standards"".  Yes, this one is as well...  That is the kind of review that I LOOK for.  I hope to help other parents with my moral standards to not spend money on things that they will be unhappy with.)",1363564800,9,871,4.106508875739645
8345686,5,B001V7UX58,"I want to review this Wonder Pets DVD as being the best fun loving educational DVD,s to watch. I,am talking about all the Wonder Pets DVD,s I purchased. I,am dissapointed they do not show them on tv no more. I bet lots of children would love them to. I,am glad they have the DVD,s on the Wonder Pets that you can buy. I hope they always keep them around so other people or children can order them. If they made more new eposodes on them I would order more Wonder Pets DVD,s.",1358208000,,474,4.163043478260869
8345687,5,B001V7UX58,"Cute as always.  Go underground and meet the rabbit family.  Typical one bunny wants to stay up and the others want to sleep.  A magic show is cute and takes ""teamwork"" to solve.",1357603200,,178,4.333333333333333
