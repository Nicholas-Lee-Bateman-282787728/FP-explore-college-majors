I never read the manga this movie is based on and I'm not sure if it's been released in America... but like all of the movies I've seen from Sion Sono (with maybe the exception of the more campy Tokyo Tribe?), Himizu hits on dark undercurrents of Japanese culture without compromise or apology. The characters are great and easy to relate to, and the pain feels real. Glad to watch another masterpiece from this genius director.",1481155200,,451,4.580246913580247

8669124,5,B00LYHXEWO,"Himizu (Mole) is about a boy whose deepest wish is to live an ordinary, decent life. Unfortunately, the deck is heavily stacked against him due to appalling parents, and the fact that he's living in the aftermath of the 2011 tsunami, which has exposed all kinds of mental fault lines in society. The boy -- sullen, brusque, violent and driven to despair -- is sometimes saner, kinder and more clear-sighted than the ostensibly normal people around him. It's a dark movie, one that's often difficult to watch. A genuinely moving story and excellent performances from the cast ultimately overcome minor problems with pacing. (Edited to add description of the movie.)",1420761600,9,664,5.045454545454546
