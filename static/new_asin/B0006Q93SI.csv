8187911,2,B0006Q93SI,"The packaging for this DVD was very promising...but too good to

be true.  This is a poorly done ""clip"" show that could have been

a keeper.

The good:

You get a brief glimpse at a half dozen different contests.

There is a top ten segment that features the ""best"" contest

winners (although not all of the girls actually won.)

The BAD:

In the main program, the clips of each girl's routine is edited down to about 30 seconds.  You hardly have time to identify the

girl, then they move on to the next performer.

What's even more STUPID:  They take the time to show the lame

award presentation of each contest in its entirity!  (Don't all

guys buy these DVDS to see the girls get a bouquet of flowers?)

Overall, I wouldn't pay full price for this DVD (unless you're

gonna use your pause button every ten seconds...)

Hot Body did a horrible job editing this one.",1106956800,15,870,4.426751592356688
