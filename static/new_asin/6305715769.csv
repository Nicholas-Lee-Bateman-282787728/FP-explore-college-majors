1061700,5,6305715769,"Just had a chance to check this movie out, by an absolute coincidence. I have to say I was VERY impressed. The acting was VERY good. The music was even better. And it was filled with unexpected moments that spiced it up all the way. Reminded me a lot of 'Being John Malkovich'.
 Talks about things you can relate in more than one way... about how you can let good things go away, blinded by other things that momentarily look like they can fill your life... but not for long.
 I absolutely recommend it... I also wish (like one of the other reviewers) they released the soundtrack. The music is absolutely awesome, and I don't only mean the U2 music or concert moments highlighted.",987292800,,681,4.483870967741935
1061701,1,6305715769,"This movie contradicts all the points it tries to make about the movie ""biz"" and even fails at its base attempt at being funny. While trying to make a point about how women are exploited in films, the movie has its romantic leading female running around topless or in see-through tops for half the film. That's just one of the many examples of gross hypocrisy evident throughout the film. If you want to see more, then by all means, check out this ""edgy and hip comedy.""",970617600,3,470,4.476744186046512
1061702,4,6305715769,"I enjoyed this film. Obviously intended to be a comedic look at a tender romance that's slipping through the lovers' grasp against a whirling  backdrop of meddling producers, well-meaning family, U2 concerts, and  things that seem like a good idea when you're really drunk. Performances  given by Dorff and Godreche were great! Dorff's narration lends a quirky  aspect to this 'wacky' film. It is a bit slow in a few parts but well, life  is like that. I'll be watching for more films by Joanou. Note to fans-Bono  and the band appear late in the film and his role is quite small.",967680000,,580,4.637254901960785
1061703,2,6305715769,"I'm sorry to disagree with everyone but i didn't like this movie at all...the storyline was so abysmally boring and predictable that it was a  real disappointment.  I had seen, i'm sure like most others who found this  movie, as a preview before a rented movie and the only reason i got it was  because of the talking cat , which i thought looked hilarious, and also the  fact that U2 was in it seemed to give it some credibility, even though i  knew in the back of my head that Stephen Dorff isn't the greatest actor.  Phil Joanou (director of the film...i think that's how you spell it) should  stick to music videos because he defintely has a knack for cool shots, and  visuals (the reason i gave this two stars), but unfortunately forgot that  no matter how much style and flash you put on, its a good story that sells  a movie, not visual effects.  I wouldn't waste your time, unless you are a  diehard U2 fan..otherwise there are much better movies to be seen..",964828800,6,967,4.395480225988701
1061704,5,6305715769,"I'm so glad I caught a preview for this movie, as I never would have heard of it otherwise.  It is sweet, witty, and original--not so much in the plot but in the way it's told.  Great performances by all involved, and a  well-done crossover to movies from music videos by director Phil Joanou.  See it!",958176000,,302,4.339285714285714
1061705,5,6305715769,"I don't really know where to begin. Maybe it's just the state of mind I'm in at the moment, but this film absolutely blew me away. I've never been a Stephen Dorff fan and I'll be honest, I only rented the movie because I am  a die-hard U2 fan. Every single thing in this movie is so well thought out  and performed by all the actors and the soundtrack is fantastic. I wish  they would realse it on CD. Phil Jounou is a visionary and I will recommend  this film to all my friends. The home movie segment in central park is one  of the most beautiful moments in film that I have ever seen. This movie is  excellent.",957139200,7,613,4.109243697478991
1061706,5,6305715769,A splendid piece of writing and directing.  The movie not only has a story line that will peak your interest but it also has great directing and cinematography.  I would recommend this title to anyone who is looking for  a rivoting movie.,951868800,,238,4.619047619047619
1061707,5,6305715769,"I was interested to see what Phil Joanou would do with a film after seeing his work with music video.  The result is beautiful and briliant.  A great script, amazing images, and the cat had me on the floor. Joanou's music  video experience is evident throughout the film with experimental effects  that not only look cool, they're captivating.  ""Entropy"" is time  well spent.  Thanks for a great film, Phil.",951609600,,407,4.811594202898551
1061860,5,6305715769,"I have to say that this movie should be considered one of the greatest films of all time.  It was story that was never thought of before and Phil Joanou did a great job of putting it to screen.  It's a relatively underground flick, I'm a film student and no one including teachers that i have met have ever scene it.  I wish it was available on DVD, but it'll make it there eventually.  I thought Stephen Dorff did an excellent job, and I'm not a real fan of U2 but they were perfect in this movie.  If you ever see this movie on the rack at your local video store pick it up immediately, you will not be disappointed.",1065657600,2,618,4.116666666666666
1061861,5,6305715769,"I'm not here to write a review, you either like it or you don't. But I am here to help out a few of the song junkies like myself sooth that aching pain of not finding a certain song or soundtrack. I've only seen the movie once, so I'm pulling these out of my head of what I remember being in the movie - I don't have a complete list, I'll try and repost it if I ever find them.
 The U2 Songs are easy to find, just scour the net a bit.
 A few that come to mind are:
  U2 - Mofo among the other harder to find ones.
  Bran Van 3000 - Drinking in L.A.  :: This is the haunting pulse song that seems to resonate during the movie, you'll know it when you hear it.
  And..Im drawing a serious blank. One was titled Vultures, another Female Species, and Sea - those I remember reading during the credits. Sorry I can't be of more help.
  Good luck on your search.",1060300800,2,857,3.9244186046511627
1061862,5,6305715769,"I absolutely did not think that I would love this movie this much. The cover of the movie doesn't really say much and the back part of the box doesn't really make the movie seem that interesting.  But I took a chance on it and I LOVED it.  I watched it on my own and I called my girlfriend up once it was finished and told her that I wanted to watch this movie with her.  It's a good movie to watch with someone you love and don't want to lose.  It's not like any typical love story. It doesn't end in too much of a happy way like other love story movies do. I say that because other love stories go, a guy meets someone he loves and something might go wrong somewhere along their relationship but in the end she'll realize that he's sorry or whatever and they'll live happily ever after.  THis awesome movie doesn't end this way.  Yet, that just makes the love story even better and makes your realize that just because two people love each other doesn't always mean they'll end up together or should. It makes you see that sometimes you might make a mistake in your relationship that can really ruin it forever.  Watch it- it's an awesome movie!",1041206400,5,1147,4.258064516129032
1061863,5,6305715769,"I watch films more than most people I know( and I live in Hollywood), and maybe it was just the point in my life in which i could relate to the film, but this movie is AMAZING!.  After watching it on accident about 2 years ago, I have since watched it about 15 times.  Each charactor plays such a perfect roll to exemplify the entropy we feel in all our lives, and the way people try to interfear with our own paths.  Whether you are a romantic, or a jaded heart-broken movie watcher, you will find true relation to this amazing story.",1028851200,3,535,4.2254901960784315
1061864,5,6305715769,"This is an excellent film. It's especially great for those interested in U2 or film in general. It's a simple love story that takes place between a director and a model in NYC. The theme is based entirely on something that happens to everyone but Joanou takes it and places it in a situation never seen before. Extremely original and funny. It's advertised as a comedy but is much much more. I almost got a little teary-eyed in the end because of its similarity with my own life. This seems like a movie you'd never watch but I have no clue why it didn't make more money. Definitely a must see.

1061865,3,6305715769,"i did find myself strangely drawn to this movie...but I do believe that it was mostly because of the cinematography. It portrayed the relationship of the character Jake(stephen dorff) and his girlfriend  in a way that everyone can relate to and think ""awww"" without it being so ""corny"". The movie took a turn for the worse when the talking cat came, it sort of makes you wonder if you are watching the same movie. After that part it dragged on to the end and U2 sure did not make the movie any better. I think they actually made it worse. The film had a really good start though and I would pay the used price for it...but just turn it off before the cat comes...haaa",1021248000,,667,4.336

1061868,3,6305715769,"I randomly ran across this film while browsing through cable channels one afternoon. What immediately struck me was the clean and polished visual presentation (in both set design and photography) and the fact that the central characters, while looking like the typically vapid, self-absorbed, hypocritical yuppies that normally populate films of this genre (the urban, contemporary romantic dramedy), actually seemed to have some interesting things to say. I ended up watching the rest of the film and enjoying it immensely.
The writing did, at times, feel a bit smug (as if Joanou actually believed that he was saying something that hadn't been said before), but this was forgivable in light of the interesting visual and narrative risks he was willing to take in the film. Also, I was drawn in to Stephen Dorff's refined but energetic performance. The talking cat was a bit gimmicky, but really was quite funny, with some special effects that would put the creators of the abysmal ""Cats and Dogs"" to shame.
So, yes, I did enjoy the film and thought it was well worth watching, but I wouldn't go so far (as some reviewers here have) to say that it even compares with Spike Jonze's brilliant, visionary work in ""Being John Malkovich."" I'm sorry, kids, but a talking cat does not measure up to the tweaked, surreal universe that Jonze was able to bring to life in that film. Also, it seems that most of the reviewers here erroneously believed this film to be Phil Joanou's first feature film since his music video days. Not at all true. Go rent ""State of Grace,"" which he directed back in 1990. It is about the Irish mob in New York and stars Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, John Turturro, John C. Reilly, and Robin Wright (my god, what a cast). It is arguably one of the greatest gangster films ever made, and simply dwarfs ""Entropy,"" as good as it is, in terms of cinematic achievement. The performances are simply flawless across the board. Go rent it now.",996451200,,1961,4.75366568914956

7893269,4,6305715769,I don't know what it is about this film but it's incredibly endearing.  Beautifully shot with every image that tells a story.  Stephen Dorff is excellent in the movie and there are plenty of subtle yet funny performances.  Plus there's Bono and a talking cat!

7893270,4,6305715769,"I've been wanting to see this ever since I caught part of it on cable about twelve years ago.  Finally got tired of waiting for the DVD and decided to dust off the old VCR.

This is a fun movie, one of those if you think about it for too long the less you enjoy it.  My advice is too not over-analyze it and you'll like it better.  It is supposedly based on a true story with many of the scene's taken directly from writer/director Phil Joanou's real life.

Stephen Dorff is good in this film, it's definitely my favorite performance of his.  His character Jake reminds me somewhat of a cross between Christian Slater and Bruce McCulloch from The Kids in the Hall.  Judith Godreche is beautiful, and there are a number of recognizable stars that I was surprised to see in a film that never received a proper stateside release.  Oh, and I simply cannot forget Kelly MacDonald as Pia.  Oh, poor Pia!

I do recommend this lost gem that somehow never got the release it deserved, but again, you may not want to think too much about what you've just seen and you'll like it better.",1345507200,,1076,4.36180904522613
7893271,4,6305715769,"Phil Joanou's use of camera filters, and color highlights, did a fantastic job of setting the mood for this film.

7893272,1,6305715769,"Leave it to Disney to put their name behind Fall Out Boy T-Shirts as well as this overwrought disaster ""starring"" Stephen Dorff. This is quite honestly one of the most pretentious, smarmy movies I have ever seen. It's slickness goes beyond distraction; a character that has to choose between being something like a Euro-trash director or a remarkably superficial relationship with a model. ""Entropy"" almost taunts its viewers with the notion that a life of intrigue depends on the relative shallowness of its most important characters. Slickly made and with style for style's sake cinematography, its direction immediately dates it to the late nineties, a work of film-school camera tricks and Hollywood malaise that's beyond condescending. Joanou never tries to get us to like Dorff's character, but to be honest, we've already decided not to by the time the opening credits have finished..",1187049600,,891,5.2377622377622375

After seeing Dorff's mug, I figured this was going to be another crappy movie; I never liked any of his movies... till this one. I missed the first 10 minutes but the few seconds I saw drew me in almost instantaneously. I've always thought Dorff as being typecasted as a movie ""baddie"" or heel. This movie absolutely redeemed Dorff's image as being a very versatile actor. The movie also had plenty of twists and side stories that kept me amused ( I enjoyed the talking cat scene); and the small narration scenes was a welcome treat due to the humor behind it. A must see! Independent films rock!... not to mention the cameo of U2 added the icing on the topping. This film will definitely be added to my library.",1118793600,4,804,4.476190476190476
7893275,3,6305715769,"Stephen Dorff (Blade, Cecil B. Demented) plays a music video director who becomes a movie director. The film he's working on is a period piece. In filming this movie he falls in love with a French model, Judith Godreche (?),  and they becoming in love and their relationship blossoms. He works on the movie while she models but she thinks he's getting a little carried away on his work. Things happen like in all relationships especially if its a director or an actor and their girlfriend has a jealous fit of rage. So, Godreche goes to Europe for a shoot while Dorff stays back in the US finishing directing the picture. Godreche breaks it off with Dorff because she is seeing someone else, so Dorff is also kicked off the movie so he goes back to doing music videos for the rock band U2 (Bono, Larry, Edge). Dorff meets this a irish woman, Kelly MacDonald (Gosford Park, Finding Neverland), and desides he wants to get married to her right away. Bono of U2 who appears on a television screen tries to convince him not to but Dorff ignores Bono and the 2 love birds get married (its videotaped) in Las Vegas with Elvis playing guitar in the background. Godreche wants to get back with Dorff but Dorff is married to MacDonald...so at the U2 concert, while U2 is playing Mysterious Ways....they show Dorff's wedding video..so Godreche sees it..she runs off and also his friends tell him he's back on the movie so it's this intwinded sort of thing going on..hence the title of the movie..Entropy. Dorff is extremely good but some of it is a little cheesy but hey, what can you say with a movie that has the guys from U2 in it? Godreche as the french girl is miscast but Kelly MacDonald..the shorthair irish girl is cute as ever.
