3467829,4,B001AVCFGK,While I love the movie I just spent several hours being suprised by the a-typical letterboxing of the movie.  While it is widescreen it is more like the letterboxing they put on certain tv shows as viewed on television.  I would have rather had a more noticable widescreen representation.  It's a beautiful movie but the sweeping views have a good chance of being cut out when you don't get the full picture you saw in the movie theatre.,1227052800,,437,4.576923076923077
3467830,4,B001AVCFGK,"I loved the Sisterhood series of books by Ann Brashares and also the first movie, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. In comparing the books and movies, one needs to keep in mind that it is difficult to adapt a book into a movie, more so when it is a series of books as popular as the Sisterhood series. That being said, it is possible to like the movies, provided one keeps an open mind about the adaptations.

I liked this second installment in the Sisterhood series - the girls are two years older and the pants is very much in use, though not looking any worse. The same actresses reprise their roles here - America Ferrara plays the outspoken Carmen who is a student at Yale, Blake Lively plays the emotionally troubled Bridget [her mom committed suicide a few years back] who is at Brown, Alexis Bledel is Lena Kaligaris the artist who is now a scholarship student at an art school in Rhode Island, and finally Amber Tamblyn returns as the strong-willed and fiercely independent Tibby who is studying film in NY.

The four friends reunite in their hometown at the beginning of summer vacation, but all soon go their separate ways and as is typical of the series, they each face personal challenges- Carmen is off to summer drama camp and discovers an inner talent for acting, Bridget goes off on an archaeological dig in Turkey but then heads off to Alabama to reconnect with her past, Lena takes up a summer figure drawing class and is grieving her beloved grandfather's death and loss of her sweetheart Kostos [only to find herself attracted to Leo an artist], and finally Tibby faces a very challenging summer when her long-time BF Brian and she break-up after an unexpected revelation.

The four stay connected through the pants, though their face-to-face interactions with each other are minimal throughout the long summer. Yet, their friendship prevails and is the one tie that binds them all together through all their personal travails.

I felt that the acting was above average - Amber Tamblyn continues to display her acting chops and is truly proving to be a gifted actor [ Joan of Arcadia, the little-known but riveting human drama Stephanie Daley], America Ferrera is definitely proving to be a huge talent [Ugly Betty] and her role as Carmen is credibly done, Blake Lively who was an unknown when she was cast as Bridget in Sisterhood 1 is proving to be a talented actress herself [Gossip Girl fame has only enhanced her talents], and finally Alexis Bledel - though her star seemed very bright a few years back when she did Sisterhood 1 [and she had fame back then too as Rory Gilmore in Gilmore Girls], she has since not been seen in too many film projects [the only one I can think of is an indie flick titled I Am Reed Fish]. I felt Alexis' role as Lena was the weakest in this movie.

All in all, the movie does take a lot of liberties with Ann Brashares' work, but despite that, I enjoyed the movie and the girls' portrayals as young women dealing with challenges and how friendship keeps them afloat, and of course, a certain magical pair of pants!",1226966400,,3073,4.6208791208791204

3467832,5,B001AVCFGK,"SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS 2 is a heartwarming film that follows the story of four friends, Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), Carmen (America Ferrera), Lena (Alexis Bledel), and Bridget (Blake Lively) who have relied on a pair of decorated blue jeans to keep their friendship together.  The storyline is a continuation of the first film, but now the girls are young college women at Yale and NYU attempting to live their lives.  However, through the process, each one experiences individual dilemmas that somehow hamper the friendship -- miscommunication and misunderstandings, or simply not sure of what to do in their particular situation. But in the end, the four find out that the magic of their friendship lies more than in a pair of pants.

The film concentrates on four separate storylines that include high and low points.  Indeed, there is romantic angst that each of the women go through -- Tibby and Brian (Leonardo Nam), Lena and Kostos (Michael Rady) and Lena and Leo (Jesse Williams), and Carmen and Ian (Tom Wisdom, where most viewers will see it as a so-called chick flick.  But beyond that, there are thought-provoking moments that make the film interesting, which involve Bridget.  After spending time at an archaeological dig and visiting her grandmother (Blythe Danner) in Alabama, she begins to come to terms with her mother's death.  And Carmen also experiences daunting moments where she decides not settle as a theater stage hand when she lands a lead part as Perdita in what looks like a summer stock rendering of Shakespeare's ""A Winter's Tale""; Carmen has to deal with her Yale counterpart, Julia (Rachel Nichols), who briefly stirs a hint of jealousy when she gets more attention, especially from Ian and theater director played by Kyle Maclachlan.

Overall, SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS 2 is an entertaining film.  It is a movie filled with mixed emotions that include a few laughs as well as one of those tissue paper moments.  Director Sanaa Hamri and Writers  Elizabeth Chandler and Ann Brashares captures the essence of friendship.",1219449600,,2065,5.044117647058823
3467833,4,B001AVCFGK,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, namely Carmen, Bridget, Tibby, and Lena are heading off in four different directions after graduating from high school.  They will be pursuing drama, archaeology, writing, and art at some excellent schools and colleges. They continue to keep in touch via e-mail, cell phone, and of course the traveling pants.  The girls go through family traumas, the possibility of pregnancy, and various romantic woes, as they learn to make their way in the world without the presence of their best friends.  I have read all of the books in Ann Brashare's series and am glad that they made this movie sequel which is even better than the original.  The whole concept of the Traveling Pants is that no matter what age you are female frienships are a vital part of a woman's life.",1219276800,,803,4.797101449275362
3467834,4,B001AVCFGK,"This is actually the title of the fourth and last Ann Brashares book, which this film is in part based upon. The four friends who've been kept united through first a summer of separation and now college are now doing their first college summer apart. Their interests have also diverged and each member of the sisterhood but one has a love interest (or two) now.

Carmen (America Ferrera), who was hoping that the girls would all be together again for the summer, spent her year lost at Yale.  When she realizes that everyone else has plans they hadn't told her about, she opts to go to a summer stock camp for young actors with her 'friend', Julia (Rachel Nichols). One of the Shakespearean actors in the company, Ian (Tom Wisdom) urges her to try out--and the former backstage girl actually gets a part.

Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), who was at NYU has to return for the summer because she didn't get her romantic comedy done.  She and Brian (Leonardo Nam) take things to the next level with some interesting consequences.

When Lena (Alexis Bledel) attends her Bapi's funeral in Greece, she learns that Kostos (Michael Rady) is married.  Devastated, she comes back to the RISD to art school despite her parents' wishes otherwise. She gets involved with Leo (Jesse Williams) a young male model.

Bridget (Blake Lively) is looking into the past. Before heading off for an  archeology camp in Turkey, she discovers letters from her grandmother.  She never knew the woman wrote her and this haunts her during the dig.  She eventually returns home early to meet the woman she doesn't remember (Blythe Danner).

Overall, this is definitely a chick flick.  But it's aimed at the younger crowd, the YA readers of this series.  Still, being 'forever in blue jeans' myself, I love these stories and have read every one.

The coda for this series is excellent and a good testament to the stuff that binds friendship together.  It's not all blue jeans, but the shared memories and continued communication between friends.

3467835,2,B001AVCFGK,"Director Sanaa Hamri takes over for Ken Kwapis for the sequel to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Bringing back all of the same characters from the original, the film does an exemplary job of telling a new story without requiring the audience to have viewed the first one. Unfortunately, the four interweaving trials of our slowly distancing heroines don't offer up any noticeably authentic revelations or any truly groundbreaking advances in their lives. Many little subplots develop, but most barely affect the whole, and by the end of this lengthy exploration of young women coming of age, nothing warranting a sequel has taken place.

In the first film, four best friends miraculously found a pair of jeans that fit each one perfectly. Using the pants as a way to stay close together as they journey away to college, the four girls mail the heavily decorated jeans back and forth to one another as a good luck charm, and plan to meet up during their summer breaks. Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) works at a video store, and struggles with commitment to her boyfriend. Lena (Alexis Bledel) is studying figure drawing, and is attempting to keep her mind off of a heart-wrenching breakup. Bridget (Blake Lively) is invested in sports and archaeology, but remains troubled over the death of her mother. And Carmen (America Ferrera) is a stagehand for school plays, who isn't quite sure of what to do with her future.

When summer finally rolls around, the four girlfriends realize that each has their own goals and agendas, and that time spent together has become more difficult and seemingly less important. Their coven-like rituals of sharing adventures has steadily lost its meaning, and the foursome discovers that their summer is going to be drastically more independent. But as Lena confronts her ex, Tibby deals with a contraceptive malfunction, Carmen's mother goes into labor, and Bridget reunites with her long lost grandmother, the four girls rediscover their friendship and the importance of sticking together.

The ideals are nothing new, the events that frequent each storyline are generic, and the revelations are simplistic. Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 is an average coming-of-age film that fails to muster up any reasons justifying its existence. It is a continuation of familiar character's lives, and its strongest asset is in its storytelling approach. Whether or not each girl is appealing or relatable, and although many references to the original are made, their stories are plotted out with enough detail that watching the first film is not a prerequisite.

Two love triangles arise, endurances are tested, and miracles are summoned. Jealousy rears its ugly head, betrayal emerges, and every supporting character is physically picture perfect. As each young woman undergoes many trivial and unemotional plot developments, the picture begins to drag. Sisterhood 2 becomes an unnecessarily long film, which constantly reminds the audience that none of the diminutive, unmoving events amount to anything special. For a film with so many lead characters and so many tales to tell, it couldn't be more pointless.

3467836,4,B001AVCFGK,"The impression that ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" gives is that it's a bubbly, bright, and--for all intents and purposes--meaningless sequel to the first film. To my relief, it follows the example set by its predecessor, a surprisingly levelheaded friendship story. Four years after discovering a magically fitting pair of jeans, best friends Tibby Tomko-Rollins (Amber Tamblyn), Carmen Lowell (America Ferrera), Lena Kaligaris (Alexis Bledel), and Bridget Vreeland (Blake Lively) have returned for a second chapter that remains on perfectly equal ground with the first, focusing on coming-of-age issues like maturity, self-discovery, family, and love. Unoriginal ideas? Maybe so, but that doesn't mean they're any less effective. If anything, they make the film's message that much clearer. It helps that many of the girls' problems are based in reality--high school issues, like being pretty and popular, are pushed aside in favor of adult issues, like pregnancy scares and family crises.

If there's anything we learned from the first film, it's that the magic of the titular jeans was symbolic; by in large, the girls worked through their own ups and downs on their own, with no miraculous intervention other than their friendship with one another. We learn pretty much the same thing in this film, which sees each character facing new, more mature challenges. Let's begin with Carmen, who doubles as the film's bookend narrator. She now attends Yale, working as a stagehand for the theatre department. Her mother (Rachel Ticotin) has since remarried and is now pregnant with her second child. When Carmen's hopes of spending the summer with her friends are dashed, she decides to join a Shakespearian theater company in Vermont with a prima donna named Julia (Rachel Nichols). Once there, a British actor named Ian (Tom Wisdom) coaxes Carmen into auditioning for ""A Winter's Tale""; to her shock--and to Julia's horror--she's cast as Perdita. As rehearsals continue, she begins to fall in love with Ian.

Next, there's Bridget, who plays Soccer at Brown University. Lately, her interests have shifted to archeology. While on an expedition in Turkey, her instructor, Professor Nasrin Mehani (Shohreh Aghdashloo), opens her eyes to the fact that she's only running away from her past. Bridget, it seems, is still haunted by the suicide of her mother. And her relationship with her father (Ernie Lively) is worse than ever; before leaving for Turkey, she discovered a box full of letters her grandmother had written her, letters her father wanted to keep hidden. Returning to the United States, Bridget takes a bus to Alabama and finally meets her grandmother, Greta (Blythe Danner), an accommodating woman with a matter-of-fact outlook on everything, including her daughter's mental illness.

The next in line is Tibby, who continues to pursue her filmmaking dreams at NYU. Forced to stay in New York for the summer to rewrite her screenplay, she gets a job at a local video store. She's now dating Brian McBrian (Leonardo Nam), who was introduced in the first film as the ""Dragon's Lair"" champion. When their relationship is threatened (for reasons I won't reveal), Tibby begins to wonder if she was meant for happiness. She does put up a wall every time she gets close to someone, and that's because, deep down, she believes that those you love the most will eventually abandon you. Her attempts to get sympathy from Carmen are flatly rejected; she doesn't appreciate how uncommunicative Tibby has been all summer.

Finally, there's Lena, who attends an art college in Rhode Island on a scholarship. Heartbroken after breaking up with her Greek boyfriend, Kostos (Michael Rady), she reverts to her old timid ways. She then meets Leo (Jesse Williams), the male model hired to pose nude in her art classes. It isn't long before they fall in love, although we suspect it's for all the wrong reasons. All she really knows about Leo is that he's a nice guy, and he's incredibly handsome. But does she know what she wants out of life? Does she even know who she is? How can know she when she's torn between two men?

Naturally, the pants themselves have to play a part in this story, and indeed, they're continually FedEx-ed from friend to friend. The question is: Do any of them need the pants anymore? You'd think that, at this point, a pair of old jeans traveling the world would reveal itself as a big metaphor. They may realize that by the time the film ends. I'm not entirely sure, though.

Moments of this movie are perhaps a little too sentimental, and the general plot may be a little too formulaic. At times, the dialogue is a bit contrived. Consider this conversation: When Tibby says drearily, ""I suck at relationships. I should have been a guy,"" Lena calmly responds, ""A guy wouldn't care about sucking at relationships."" Only best friends in a coming-of-age story could get away with lines like that. Then again, I never expected a reinvention of the wheel. Movies like ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2""--and its predecessor--are aimed at a very specific audience, namely teenage girls; if they can get something out of it other than the sight of four young women looking pretty, if they can leave the theater understanding the more complex aspects of the story, then the filmmakers can include all the predictable dialogue they want. I think this movie will get the job done, not merely for teenage girls, but for anyone open to the idea.",1218067200,39,5471,5.0
3467837,4,B001AVCFGK,"First of all, it is certainly an interesting experience to be the only guy in the theater for a movie like ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.""  At least I was not the oldest person there, and while that person was my date at least we could take comfort in knowing that we have both read all four of Ann Brashares' novels about the ""Sisterhood,"" and therefore were entitled to be there with all the young folks.  Screenwriter Elizabeth Chandler (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-a-Girl-Wants/dp/B00009XITP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What a Girl Wants</a>"") is working mainly from the final book in the series, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forever-in-Blue-The-Fourth-Summer-of-the-Sisterhood/dp/0385729367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood</a>,"" which means that Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) has a pregnancy scare in New York City, Carmen (America Ferrera) is doing a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare/dp/0199535914/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare</a>&nbsp;play in Vermont, Bee (Blake Lively) is on a archeological dig in Turkey, and Lena (Alexis Bledel) is drying to figure out how to draw a nude male model.  However, some key elements from earlier novels are worked in the story, specifically Lena finding out Kostos is married and Bee meeting her grandmother from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Second-Summer-of-the-Sisterhood/dp/0553495011/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Second Summer of the Sisterhood</a>,"" and Carmen's mother having a baby from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-in-Pants-The-Third-Summer-of-the-Sisterhood/dp/0553495046/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood</a>"" (to be clear, the movie tie-in paperback being published as ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" is the fourth book, ""Forever Blue"" and not the book about the second summer).

Having read the books can be a key factor in enjoying the movie because things move really quickly and fans of the series will constantly be filling in gaps.  The best indication of how fast things move is that when Bee goes to Alabama her grandmother (Blythe Danner) immediately reocgnizes her, so they forgo the entire bit about Bee pretending to be Gilda.  The biggest element missing from the final book is Bee's romance in Turkey, but the decision to create a new character, Shohreh Aghdashloo as Professor Nasrin Mehani, is a good move because it places the emphasis on Bee coming to terms with her mother's suicide, which was arguably the most important thing that happened to her in the four books.  Additionaly, following Tibby's pregnancy scare with having to be in the delivery room with Carmen's mother added an additional resonance to Tibby's story.

Circumstances have certainly  changed for the four actresses since the release of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sisterhood-of-the-Traveling-Pants/dp/B000AM4PEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</a>"" three years ago can simply be expressed by noting that when the first movie came out Tamblyn was doing ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joan-of-Arcadia/dp/B0007TKHKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joan of Arcadia</a>"" and Bledel had ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilmore-Girls/dp/B000U0F7RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilmore Girls</a>,"" and now those shows are done and Ferrera with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ugly-Betty/dp/B00005JPII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ugly Betty</a>"" and Lively on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gossip-Girl/dp/B000W6ZUUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gossip Girl</a>"" are currently in the front seat of American pop culture.  There was reportedly some reluctance to get the band back together for this second film, but at least everybody got to go to Santorini this time around and watch Bledel freckle.  However, the main thing I noticed in this second movie is that Amber Tamblyn is clearly the best actress in the bunch, which is saying something if you have seen Ferrera in ""Real Women Have Curves.""  But this is Tamblyn's movie and most of the best moments (and virtually all of the good lines) belong to her.

The other thing I noticed is that the guys in this movie are all good guys.  Brian (Leonardo Nam) is everything Tibby is not, which is exactly what she needs, Ian (Tom Wisdom) is the proverbial Prince Charming for Carmen, and the only downside for Lena choosing between Leo (Jesse Williams) and Kostas (Michael Rady) is that one of the two does not believe there is one person who everybody to love, which is not exactly a deal breaker.  The only really villain in the proceedings would be Carmen's supposed friend, Julia (Rachel Nichols), but that just underscores the point that the girl's are in many ways their own worst enemies.  Their faults, dear readers, lie in themselves more in than others, and for the Sisterhood actualization truly comes from within.  Again, because the film is covering so much, flipping from character to character as the Traveling Pants make their appointed rounds, there is a sense of sketching characters and connecting dots.  Not knowing the back stories, which are necessarily reduced to assumptions without the benefit of actual exposition, can put viewers at risk for enjoying this summer of 2008 film.  Director Sanaa Hamri made her mark directing music videos, so at least she has an appreciation for having to be concise in her scenes.  The net result is not a great film, but certainly a satisfying one for the Sisterhood readership.",1218067200,12,5901,6.3801756587202005

My daughter who is 14 years old, has watched both part 1 and part 2 of this movie. She LOVES them. I must admit I did watch them with her, and it reminded me of the friends I had grow up, the ones that 30 years later, we are all still friends and very close with each other. This cast works very well for this movie, showing four (4) different personalities who mange to stick together and remain friend no matter what happens. Yes there are fights and arguments, but that is normal in any friendship or relationship. Four (4) friends who step up when needed, and take charge when they have to. Friends like these are hard to come by so when you find them you hold on tight!

The story itself was a little over the top (four barely-adult girls just pick up and head to Greece on a whim???)...but it IS ONLY a movie - I can suspend belief.  LOL  But it was cute to watch.  And America Ferrera was excellent, which surprised me a bit - I had only ever seen her in Ugly Betty.",1408665600,,461,4.112359550561798

3467988,4,B001AVCFGK,"You know those nights when you can't really go out because you have to be to work early the next morning, but you are bored and you just kind of want to veg? This is the perfect movie for those nights. It's not too heavy, but it does have enough 'umph' to keep you interested. Four girls who've been close friends for years go off to college. We've all been in the post high school chapter of our lives where we are trying to balance a new life/new friends with our old lives and make it all fit.

I don't think that you would have to watch the first one to understand what's happening, the movie does a good job of explaining everything, but I would highly recommend watching the first one because it's adorable as well.",1406246400,2,721,4.262773722627737

3467994,3,B001AVCFGK,"The problem of the movie is that they change it too much from the book.

3468033,2,B001AVCFGK,"The first Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movie wasn't bad. It wasn't amazing, but it was entertaining to watch. It was a sweet and simple story that had its faults. The sequel kept the faults, but failed to keep a story that could be followed to salvage it.

The idea that all of them are separated and have their own stories to work out made for a better premise than the first movie. It was poorly executed though. Not enough time was given for each story to develop, which just made the movie choppy and disjointed.

It was a good idea to look at Bridget's mother and the way she has handled her mother's suicide. Honestly, the way her mother's death has effected her is the most interesting part of her character. But even this plot ends up going stale after a while. It's essentially the same kind of conversation she had with her friends in the first movie, just with the grandmother we didn't even know existed before.

Lena's story is primarily about her conflict between two men, Kostos from the first film, and the model from her art class. I won't tell you how that ends. Lena's whole story here centers around her love life, and this still manages to be one of the more solid stories.

Tibby, recovering from the loss of her friend and her boring life in a small town, moves to NYC to work in a video store and take a scriptwriting class. Her relationship with her boyfriend of ten months is going well until they have sex. Because, as we all know, when ""good girls"" have sex in teen movies, something disastrous has to happen. To the movie's credit though, it gives Tibby a chance to take a look at her life and what she wants with it.

Carmen is taking and acting class in Vermont. She begins to explore her acting abilities and begins a relationship with a fellow actor. Carmen is the easiest to sympathize with for most of the movie and it's easy to want to root for her as she grows in confidence and begins to go on with her life.

None of these individual plots are bad and all could have been extended into decent movies on their own, but all together they just make for a rushed and jumbled mess.",1303430400,,2120,4.3816793893129775
3468034,5,B001AVCFGK,Bought this as a gift for a someone in their 20's.  This is the 2nd movie in the Traveling Pants series.  If you liked the first one you will like this one also.  This is a movie than can be enjoyed by all ages.  The movie was well received and now they have it their library to watch over and over again.,1296604800,,305,3.870967741935484
3468035,5,B001AVCFGK,"THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS2 stars Amber Tamblyn (daughter of the beloved Russ Tamblyn, star of Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, West Side Story, Tom Thumb, and other films), America Ferrera (of ""Ugly Betty"" fame), Blake Lively, and Alexis Bledel (looks like Keira Knightly, but not emaciated).  This is one of my all-time-favorite movies, mostly because of its celebration of people who devote themselves to the arts.

As with Pants-1, the film uses a pair of patched blue jeans as a device that provides a unifying feature to the story.  Each girl wears the blue jeans for a while, then mails the blue jeans to the next girl, and the film follows the adventures of each girl in succession.  The movie starts with a purse-snatching, but then the camera pans to the right, and we see a movie camera filming the purse-snatching (the purse-snatching was all an act).

Ms. Ferrera, a Yale undergrad has kinds of things going on in her life--her mom is pregnant, and expects to go to Alabama to visit her folks, but she is really destined to go to Vermont be a stage-hand for the summer at the Village Theater Arts Festival.

Then, we see Ms. Bledel at a funeral in Greece, and she encounters her former boyfriend from Pants-1.  She is shocked when she discovers that he has gotten married.  Then ten minutes into the movie, we see the 4 girls meet with the pants, discussing their plans.  Then they disperse -- Bledel to Greece to take art lessons, Ferrera to Vermont, Tamblyn to be a videostore clerk in New York City, and Lively to an archeological dig in Turkey.  There is actually another major character in the movie, Rachel Nichols (looks just like Renee Zellweger), who provides many interesting sneers, snide remarks, and condescending expressions.  In fact, Rachel Nichols provides more quirky expressions than all of the funny, quirky expression from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

COMEDY IN ART CLASS.

Another interesting subtle point is when Ms. Bledel has her first day in the figure drawing class, and the model is a totally naked hunk.  (Don't worry, parents, they don't show anything.)  Bledel is nervous, talks excessively in a nervous manner, and nervously drops her pencil box.  Also, she twiddles her hair nervously.

COMEDY WITH ASIAN BOYFRIEND.

Ms. Tamblyn provides a nice contrast to the other overachieving girls (actress, archeologist, artist). She is just a clerk in a video rental outlet.  Her dialogue is about late fees.  The film centers around her relationship with her boyfriend.  In this movie, they both lose their you-know-what together.  Ms. Tamblyn exclaims, ""Even though I am a feminist, I still enjoy a box of chocolates.""  In the same scene, she asks, ""Was I the first girl to say yes?""  The boyfriend answers, ""Of course not.  I mean, of course you are!""  30 minutes into the picture is a bit of slapstick.  Later on, when Ms. Tamblyn believes herself to be pregnant, she walks down the city street in a daze, and passes a pregnant woman struggling to enter her automobile, and passes a mother fighting with her screaming children (obviously, Ms. Tamblyn is thinking that she has entered Hell).

COMEDY IN THE THEATER.

Ms. Ferrera is back stage tending a curtain raising device, and it spontaneously malfunctions, and the curtain plops on top of actor Tom Wisdom.  This event leads to them meeting each other.

COMEDY IN TURKEY.

More comedy comes from Turkey.  Ms. Lively is at her archeological dig in Turkey.  She finds a mandible (jaw bone), discolored from thousands of years of exposure to the elements. ""Should have brushed more!"" she exclaims.

HIGH POINT OF THIS MOVIE.

The high point of this movie is Ms. Ferrera's success in being promoted from an apprentice stage hand to giving a well-received performance as the leading lady in a Shakespeare play.  While rehearsing her lines in a meadow with Tom Wisdom, Tom observes how people in the United States speak, and how Shakespeare writes: ""Instead of saying, 'Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber,' what we say is, 'Catch some ZZZ's.'""  And during a rehearsal, Ms. Ferrera delivers her lines so elegantly that Tom Wisdom forgets his lines.  Shortly thereafter, the director tells Ms. Ferrera, ""Do NOT go to drama school"" (referring to the fact that Ms. Ferrera is already an extraordinarily accomplished actress).  In my opinion, this particular scene, where Tom Wisdom forgets his lines, is one the greatest scenes in the history of cinema.

OVERRIDING THEME OF THIS FILM.

In addition to the theme of the pants, the movie has this overriding theme--uniting, separation, then uniting again:

(1)  Ms. Bledel is separated from her Greek boyfriend from Pants-1 (the boy who saved her from drowing).  In Pants2, we find that he has married a woman he does not care for.  But at the end of Pants-2, Bledel gets disgusted with the male model hunk, and returns to the first Greek boyfriend, since he had his marriage annuled.

(2)  Ms. Lively is separated from her grandmother for 10 years, due to a complicated glitch due to a tragedy involving her mother, and intervention by her father, but in the second half of Pants2, she is reunited with her grandmother, and they become close.

(3)  Tamblyn gets separated from her Asian boyfriend, because of that sort of uncomfortableness with the false-alarm pregnancy.  But later, they become re-united.

(4)  Ferrera is at first close to Tom Wisdom, a young British actor who stars in their play.  But betrayal from another character in the movie, Rachel Nichols, leads to uncomfortable feelings.  But this is reversed during the course of events.",1289260800,3,5602,4.908413205537806

3468047,4,B001AVCFGK,"To me, this movie felt completely like a chick flick- four young ladies make a deal to stay in touch with each other through a pair of pants (yeah, completely true) and to NEVER lose their valuable friendship no matter what happens.  Of course the girls eventually go their separate ways as they get older and go to college and meet new people, etc.

The entire movie was basically jumping around between the four ladies separate lives, and we got to see the plots that developed from each lady, and each story.  Each story was, I have no trouble admitting, somewhat interesting.  It's just that this is the kind of movie young women should be watching, not grown men like me.

I didn't feel like I could relate to any of these mini stories involving the four women, but the heck with that- I liked the storytelling regardless, and believe girls developing into adulthood will find the most interest in this kind of stuff.

I will say this though- because there's basically four different stories going on, young ladies can find a LOT of things about the story to relate to, such as friendship troubles, relationship troubles involving boys, family issues, and other things.  For what it is, it's worth watching.",1244332800,,1212,4.7156398104265405

3468065,4,B001AVCFGK,Very good movie although I liked the first one better it was still very good.,1231977600,,77,4.2
3468066,5,B001AVCFGK,"This is one of the times when the sequal is as good as the first movie. Well almost as good.  If you liked the original, you will like this.",1231977600,,140,3.8275862068965516
3468067,3,B001AVCFGK,I thought this movie did a great job showing the value of sisterhood and your nearest and dearest friends.,1231718400,,106,4.631578947368421
3468068,2,B001AVCFGK,"I really enjoyed Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  But, the sequal is boring.  The script goes nowhere and even the acting isn't as good.  It might be an OK choice if you're looking for a very light teen chick flick to watch on a rainy day.  I certainly don't recommend it though.  Glad I rented it instead of buying the DVD.",1231718400,,327,4.295081967213115
3468069,4,B001AVCFGK,"I loved this movie!  The story line was great, the scenery was awesome! Great movie to watch with the girls lol.",1231718400,,112,4.333333333333333
3468070,3,B001AVCFGK,Nice scenery and story Makes you want to dance and sing. A movie worth seeing over again.,1231632000,,89,4.294117647058823
3468071,4,B001AVCFGK,Sisterhood stories are the antithesis of Sex and the City. Youth and their coming of age bonds them. Both women rock but in a different way. An NYC backdrop vs suburbia.  Love this flick and recommend it for a pj party and chick flick night.,1231632000,,241,4.355555555555555
3468072,5,B001AVCFGK,was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my daughter & she loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.,1231545600,,108,4.35
3468073,5,B001AVCFGK,"I just want to say that as a parent of a pre-teen girl, I was so pleasantly surprised by the way that this film empowered women. I thought it included a message that pre-marital sex has consequences. I have read the books by this author and I can see that the movie changed several things to make the movie less ""trashy"" than the books. I greatly appreciated that. This was a must see movie for women - 13 and above.",1231459200,2,416,4.2125
3468074,5,B001AVCFGK,"The movie was purchased for my 14 year old daughter.  During the Christmas vacation we sat and watched it together.  We really enjoyed the first one and just as equally enjoyed number 2.  It's great to see the second one of a movie, to see how the actresses matured, and how they still had their friendship even when they lost the pants.  So thumbs up to this movie.
Bev",1231372800,,370,4.318840579710145
3468075,3,B001AVCFGK,I thought it was a cute movie but missing some of the appeal of the last film.,1231286400,,78,3.6470588235294117
3468076,5,B001AVCFGK,"This DVD is great...a great movie to watch with your friends, especially if you're into the books.",1231200000,,98,4.823529411764706
3468077,4,B001AVCFGK,"I bought this movie for my wife for Christmas.  She loved the first movie and really liked this one also.  The scenery in Greece was beautiful, it made me want to actually go to Greece.  My wife was happy, so that's all that matters in the end.",1231200000,,244,4.148936170212766
3468078,5,B001AVCFGK,What a joy to watch with your daughter of age!  My daughter (25 years old) and I saw this at the movie theater and could not wait for it to come out on dvd.  A feel good movie!,1231113600,,176,3.6052631578947367
3468079,4,B001AVCFGK,"Excellent movie.  Never read the books, but I loved the first movie, and love this one just as much!",1230940800,,100,4.2631578947368425
3468080,4,B001AVCFGK,"To be fair, I think this movie should be evaluated on its own merit.  In itself, it's actually a fairly decent story about a group of young adult girls struggling to maintain ties with each other at a time when everything else in their lives is changing.  As close to a female coming of age movie as I've seen, since that genre usually focuses on boys. It's not a great movie, but I wasn't sorry I spent the time/money on it, either.  The difficulty comes into it when it's compared to the first Traveling Pants, because the five star experience of the first film causes the second one to pale in comparison.",1230854400,,608,4.410714285714286
3468081,1,B001AVCFGK,"Why waste your time.  This  movie is the reason why so many have left the theaters to stay at home. Over the last few years the attendance at theaters has decreased.  My wife wanted to see this movie with her daughters. We left ten minutes after the opening credits.

Don't waste your money.",1230422400,,291,4.433962264150943
3468082,4,B001AVCFGK,"This is a good movie.  It brings a lot of happiness and tears.  Three years ago, I watched the first series of this movie.  This again, doesn't bring disappointment at all.  It is a fully well-done movie.  For the story, it is very touchy.  For the acting, they are better than the first one especially for America Ferrera as Carmen.  For the direction, it is all making sense and good.  Finally, the visuals are good as well.  Overall, great movie and I enjoyed it.",1230076800,,466,4.4523809523809526
3468083,3,B001AVCFGK,"The movie was alright, I made the mistake of reading all the books first so I was a little disapointed they cut a lot of stuff out.  Amazon.com was great though, I ordered the movie and had it in the mail 3 days later.",1229385600,,218,3.9545454545454546
3468084,1,B001AVCFGK,dvd cover says its full screen. i payed for full screen but dvd disc says wide screen.,1229040000,,86,4.117647058823529
3468085,5,B001AVCFGK,"I started watching this with very low expectations.  I figured it would be based on the fourth book, and I hated the fourth book, so, you know, not all that excited.  I came out of it a totally happy person.  It seems to me that the screenwriter took everything that was wrong with the fourth book and fixed it.  True, I would have liked to see Win, but that's, imo, the only thing the movie really lacked.  The acting was great, the chemistry was astounding (and here everyone was saying the girls didn't want to do this!), the storylines, amazing amazing amazing.  Upon reading book 4, I was highly disappointed that they lost the pants, but now, watching the movie, I see why it had to happen.
Random comments:
-Alexis Bledel makes a much better Lena than a Rory.  She's so much more natural as a quiet, down-to-earth girl, rather than Ms. Spoiled Rotten.
-LOVED Amber Tamblyn's acting, she's been the best part of both movies.  Her and Brian are just too cute, and her 'miracle' moment was probably my favorite of the entire movie.
-Glad they kept Labor Coach Tibby in!
-Best lines?  Tie between ""And leave me in the middle of my life?  God!"" and ""We are terrible at not loving each other.""  One hilarious, one sweet, both pretty much summarizing the entirety of this movie and real life.
I am not the type to EVER prefer a movie adaptation over a book.  I always think the movies cheapen the written word.  This is the one exception.  Loved it, loved it, LOVED it.",1227830400,10,1469,4.494339622641509
3468086,4,B001AVCFGK,"Okay, so maybe I'm not the target demographic for this film. I don't care. I enjoyed it anyway. The main thing going for it is that Bledel, Tamblyn, Lively, and Ferrera have great chemistry together. They are consistently engaging and genuinely funny. Of course, like action movies, the plot has a habit of getting in the way of the fun, but in the last quarter of the film the four of them are together and deliver the best moments.

There are also some fine performances from rest of the cast. You've got Lucy Hale as Lena's idiot kid sister. (BTW, Hale handles this role much better than Bledel did in Bride and Prejudice, but I'd love to see her cast in something outside of this mold.) You've got Rachel Nichols as acting Carmen's friend/nemesis. As Bridget's supervisor at a Turkish archaeolgical dig, Shohreh Aghdashloo shows once again why she is Hollywood's go-to actress for a strong middle eastern woman. And you've got Blythe Banner as Bridget's grandmother from Alabama. On the male side, you've got reformed Dragon's Lair addict Brian (suddenly sporting washboard abs) as Tibby's guy, Ian as Carmen's British acting foil, and Lena's twin boy-toys, ex-boyfriend Kostas and model Leo. When you combine the stars, the rest of the cast, and the picturesque scenes of Santorini, there is a lot of eye candy, probably something for everyone.

On the downside, the DVD special features are a little on the skimpy side. There are a couple of deleted scenes, none of which are earthshattering. There is a gag reel, but most of the gags are flubbed lines, not too exciting either. There is a brief vignette on the ""cliff scene"". And you can watch the film dubbed in Spanish or French with or without subtitles. I guess the stars were too busy to deliver more like with the last movie. That's okay. The bottom line is that the film is worth watching. It is good clean fun. (By the way, the PG-13 rating is absurd. This is far tamer than Gossip Girl or even Ugly Betty.)",1227225600,,1972,4.6801152737752165
3468087,5,B001AVCFGK,"I won't sit here and go into this big looooong speech about how amazing the movie is and how each part affected me. I'll just simple say that, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series are what ""true"" friendships should be like. Good times or bad, they stick by one another. You can learn so much just from watching the movies. I'll admit I cried my eyes out during the movie, but I also laughed my butt off. This movie is definitely worth seeing but even more to buy. Any of a better review then that, I'd be shocked. =] I hope you'll BUY/watch.",1227139200,,549,4.288461538461538
