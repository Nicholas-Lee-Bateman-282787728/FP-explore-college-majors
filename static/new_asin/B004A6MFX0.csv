8419537,4,B004A6MFX0,"Because of its intense boxing sequences.and a superior performance from Mr. T., ROCKY III is this reviewer's favorite of the six-film series.

Here, champion Rocco Balboa has polished the rough edges from his public persona, while defeating ten palookas hand-picked for him by protective manager/trainer, Mickey Goldmill.

Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a brutal puncher and legitimate title contender, seethes over the phoniness of it all and for not being given a chance to fight Rocky, thanks to Mickey's interference. Clubber humiliates Philly's favorite son during a statue dedication, and calls Rocky out. A seething Balboa agrees to meet Lang in the ring, but Mickey wants nothing to do with it.

Rocky convinces Mick to change his mind, and they begin training for the Clubber Lang match. On fight night, Clubber so upsets Mickey, the old pug has a coronary. Rocky is now more concerned for his friend's health than he is about the fight. Lang is able to KO him in a mere round-and-a-half.

As in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ROCKY-II/dp/6301978129/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ROCKY II</a>, Adrian whines that Rocky should just quit, not try for a rematch against Lang, but, looking to avenge Mickey's death, Rocky ignores her. Former foe Apollo Creed offers to help Rock train and they, Adrian and Paulie travel to Apollo's old stomping grounds, L.A..

Another reused plot device is making brother-in-law Paulie as conniving as ever, a real glutton for the fast buck.

A new pattern established: killing off a main character (Mickey growls his way into Valhalla).
