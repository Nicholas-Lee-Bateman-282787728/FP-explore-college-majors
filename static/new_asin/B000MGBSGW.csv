8168589,5,B000MGBSGW,"This two disc set was an absolute find for me.  Very inexpensive and with hours of great fun.  I'd rate this higher than the blue comedy tv series and way ahead of the Jeff Foxworthy show.  Great stand up , some wonderful musical stars, fun variety sketch comedy and loads of bonus content.  For a few bucks you get hours of laughs. Recommended.",1411776000,,345,4.428571428571429
8168590,4,B000MGBSGW,Jeff Foxworthy is true to form. He works out clever comedy skit versions of the jokes that he has told for 20 or more years! AND he gets the BEST in country music entertainers.,1366156800,,176,4.205882352941177
