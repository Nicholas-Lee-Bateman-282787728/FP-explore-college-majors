The characters are mellow and calming, the lessons are about growing up and respecting the earth, and the music is very good, not at all annoying to adults. I really wish this show had been around longer and caught on more, because it is far superior to many of the other kids shows like Barney.",1471910400,,460,4.554216867469879

8201034,5,B000RJO53M,Personally these are hands down the best shows on pbs... I remember watching these with my oldest son now eight when he was a tiny baby.. The music and characters drew all of us so much I memorized that birthday song for his first birthday and to this day still sing it him. Broke our hearts when they cancelled it. Now we can show his 14 mo old brother and he's getting into then add much as the rest of the family . Truly a great find and if you do buy it!!,1393977600,,459,3.946236559139785
8201035,4,B000RJO53M,"Beautiful, peaceable, musically intuitive, educational.  However the bright colors r way overbearing for the eyes, it can actually hurt. And 2 characters (a monkey and a turtle) though they r a good idea, they look scary for the younger ones, as they were not designed to be cute. This program does not hold my lil ones attention for more than 2 minutes. The makers of this program also makes (Bear In The Big Blue House) which is an awesome program. It holds my lil ones attention very well. The animals r better quality design and the colors r vibrant & not at all overbearing or bright.",1391990400,,589,4.556603773584905

8201037,5,B000RJO53M,"My daughter LOVES It's a Big Big World...she watches it day in and day out, which is why we NEEDED to get more than one of these DVDs.  The Big Big Sleep is very cute and calming to her and sometimes it even helps her close her eyes for a nap, before waking up and watching it again!  This DVD is adorable.",1213488000,3,306,3.9193548387096775
