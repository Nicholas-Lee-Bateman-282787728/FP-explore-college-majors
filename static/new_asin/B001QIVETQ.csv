8335750,4,B001QIVETQ,"Andy does a pretty good job of instruction although he could slow down a little bit on some topics. There are some areas where he could explain better, and in those cases a beginner, intermediate, or beginning advanced player would be helped to a greater degree. The pdf tabs, however, will help fill-in those instruction gap areas. Andy could have been better in the triad fragment section and power chords area. The DVD covers a lot of instruction and I think Andy does pretty well in the beginner and intermediate areas, and just acceptable in the advanced area. No matter how much the DVD is watched, its tough to make out some of the fretwork done by Andy, but that has always been a problem with DVD instruction. Overall, its a pretty good instructional DVD, especially if the learner comes in with a good background of understanding. For the sheer beginner, it will probably mean a lot of rewinding to get the instruction down pat.",1483574400,,938,4.6909090909090905
8335751,3,B001QIVETQ,I wanted to learn how to play lead guitar. I've been playing guitar for 4 years. This dvd does teach you how to play but the guy does not explain anything you have to pretty much rely on the tabs on the dvd. If it weren't for the tabs I'd give it only 1 star,1435276800,,258,3.709090909090909
8335752,5,B001QIVETQ,I gave DVD 5 stars because it is exactly what is advertised I learned some very useful information and would recommend this DVD to any beginning bass player.,1393891200,,157,4.642857142857143
8335753,1,B001QIVETQ,I got this DVD because I wanted to learn to play leads. I am not new to the guitar I play rhythm guitar and been playing the bass for years. But this DVD is awful! The guy giving the lesson shows you a scale one time then he just starts playing all over the fretboard then he says just from these three notes you can play all this. Pretty much that is how the DVD is all the way thru. I bought two DVD's called 200 Blue Licks and 200 Metal licks and gotta say I learned a lot from those. Do not waste your time and money on this piece of crap. Buy the ones I suggested instead.,1331251200,3,577,3.857142857142857
