1225485,5,B00000INEX,My grandson cannot get enough of these.  I plan to buy more for him in the coming weeks.  He watches these over any other tv program.,1457136000,,133,4.076923076923077

1225487,2,B00000INEX,It's not suited for a baby under 1 year age.,1448236800,,44,3.5
1225488,5,B00000INEX,My son loved these videos during his infant and toddler years. Loved that I could buy them new on Amazon from a reliable seller and save some money. He watched them so much that any cost should have been worth it.,1443744000,,213,4.219512195121951
1225489,1,B00000INEX,"My daughter is now seven.  She grew up watching baby Einstein until she was about three years old.  When she was little she absolutely loved it and would WANT to watch it.  Then, something happened and all of a sudden she had a fear of the puppets.  Until this day, she has a HUGE fear of anything baby Einstein which I find odd because before the age of three she was so happy to watch the videos.  Who knows what triggered this fear but it changed my mind about the brilliance of the videos and made me think deeper about what they are psychologically doing to children and we just don't know because they are too young to voice their opinion.  Every child is different.  If I ever have another child I won't be having them watch these videos.",1440201600,,745,4.316546762589928
1225490,4,B00000INEX,Great! My son absolutely loves it!. He always likes to dance to the music! It is his favorite BE video. I only give it 4 stars because he is afraid and begins to cry when the red dragon comes on. Poor guy.,1439424000,,205,3.9047619047619047
1225491,2,B00000INEX,Well I ordered Baby Bach but instead recieved Mr.  Wordsworth. So this was a little disappointing.,1435449600,,98,5.125
1225492,5,B00000INEX,Even infants love the music. Babies and toddlers are fascinated by the colors and music.,1433376000,,88,4.933333333333334
1225493,5,B00000INEX,"Our 6 week old had not stopped crying from birth (only a slight exaggeration).  When we combined this video with a high speed swing and swaddling, she would focus on the video immediately (I swear she would remember it each time it started), she would calm down, and finally get some sleep.  She's still very spirited, 5 years later, but I don't see that this video caused her any harm.  She has a perfect memory, perfect pitch, and is a bit of a musical prodigy.  She definitely had sensory issues back then (and still does), but so much of this took time (years-not months), for her to adjust to things like light, touch, and facial expressions (we don't have a sensory deprivation chamber).  So if the video keeps mom and dad 'off the ledge,' I say go for it.",1428019200,,762,4.453237410071942

1225508,5,B00000INEX,My daughter loves all the Baby Einstein movies and has been watching them since she was 2 months!  There is a definite difference when she watches these movies vs Disney cartoons on TV.  I think it is because there is only one thing on the screen for her to focus on at a time and the music is very soothing,1412208000,,307,4.1

1225512,5,B00000INEX,"Featuring the Baby Einstein ""kids"" from the others a bit older, talking and acting; such fun! I am not that picky about exact music, I just know my wee one loves it and I's rather her watch these than anything on TV.",1400976000,,216,4.166666666666667
1225513,4,B00000INEX,"My baby loved the baby Beethoven, so i decided to purchase the baby Bach too. He doesn't like baby Bach. it seems that it was made long time ago, the baby Beethoven is a newer version, maybe that's the reason.",1397606400,,209,4.25
1225534,3,B00000INEX,"Not the best movie, but it's okay. My son likes it enough but doesn't stay interesting in it. I think the bits with the children/adults laughing talking take him out of the normal Baby Einstein trance. This one seems like they were going for more of a Baby Mozart kind of thing, but it just doesn't get there.",1389830400,,309,4.344827586206897
1225535,4,B00000INEX,Baby Einstein is always great... this was one of my favorites for my kids so I bought this one for a friend.,1385942400,,108,3.9545454545454546
1225536,5,B00000INEX,My autistic grandson loves these video because he loves classical music.  He's 10 and we are on the 2nd disc because he wears them out.,1384905600,,135,4.4

1225538,4,B00000INEX,"My daughter was searching desparately for something to keep her 6 month old son occupied while she tried to get to her household chores. I bought this for her on a recommendation from a friend.  To our amazement, it worked!!!! Keeps his attention for at least 20-30 minutes.  That is a godsend for a busy mom.",1381708800,,309,4.5
1225539,5,B00000INEX,"Excellent! Bought this for my son when it first came out when he was a baby...now he plays classical music! Any link? I think so! Bought this for my 1 year old nephew, hope it works again!!!",1381017600,,190,4.162162162162162
1225540,5,B00000INEX,"Had this CD ten years ago for first grandchild, who loved it. Passed down to #2 grandchild, who also loved it. Then, thinking the family was complete, we passed the CD on to friends.  Lo and behold, new grandson born in July!  He could not miss the simple joy of the music and  visuals. I was thrilled to be able to purchase Baby Bach again. It is definitely the best of the Baby Einstein series.",1378339200,,396,4.253333333333333
1225541,5,B00000INEX,This set of DVDs replaces the Over-the-Air broadcast VHS tapes I made on my home VCR recorder.  It is excellent quality and the DVD convenience is the best feature for repeating segments for my cello students.,1375142400,,209,4.805555555555555
1225542,1,B00000INEX,I HATED THIS AND SO DID MY NIECE! I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO TEACH WITH THIS. AND CONDITION OF THE DISC WAS PROOF THAT THE PREVIOUS USERS DIDNT ENJOY IT EITHER.,1372118400,2,169,4.0
1225543,5,B00000INEX,My son enjoys the program and it keeps him happy while he expands his mind watching the visual effects. This allows me to manage the house a bit more. I find the music to be very enjoyable while I work.,1371513600,,202,4.075
1225564,5,B00000INEX,"Invaluable. We had the VHS version for our daughter and needed to update for our son. A slight guilty feel when you ""prop them up in front of the TV"" ... but it guarantees a precious half  hour of peace.",1370563200,,203,4.075
1225565,5,B00000INEX,"Exactly as advertised. Great music. Entertaining video. Kids love it and watch it over and over. We have Bach, Beethoven and Motzart and we wish the series had many other composers.",1369267200,,181,4.870967741935484
1225566,5,B00000INEX,"These are a great series of short films in which Yo-Yo Ma collaborates with different kinds of artists to make work to the 6 Bach Cello Suites.  My favorite has to be # 5, a collaboration with a famous Kabuki artist.  And #2 with the Mark Morris Dance Group is not to be missed either.  Great for any fan of Bach, Yo-Yo Ma, or great artistic collaborations!",1369008000,2,357,4.298507462686567
1225567,1,B00000INEX,"Hey Julie Aignor-Clark (or whatever your dumb toeheaded rich blonde f-ing name is)...keep your NAZI KIDS out of the video. The video was really amateurely done, and the blonde rich whiny bimbo that shamelessly exposes her ugly kids is disgusting.",1363824000,2,246,5.175
1225568,1,B00000INEX,"My 11 month old daughter has been watching Baby Einstein, (although on a rather rare basis) since she was about five months old. She loved Baby Mozart, and I was pleased to discover that I could stand the video myself. Baby Bach? Creepy. Creepy, creepy, creepy. Clowns, weird music, and random chickens and children being paraded across  the screen. I'm just thankfully that I purchased this from a children's consignment shop for about $3.00. I would have been even more irritated if I had paid full price like many of the other dissatisfied customers who have reviewed this less than satisfactory video. Skip this one and get Baby Mozart or Baby Da Vinci. This one is just too weird for words.",1361491200,4,695,4.743801652892562
1225569,5,B00000INEX,Breath taking music blended with visual compositions. Mesmerizing. I saw this on the BBC many years ago and am thrilled I can watch it over and over again now.,1360195200,,159,4.517241379310345
1225570,5,B00000INEX,This was the perfect little gift for the little man.  He really enjoys it! All babies should have a copy of this!,1355356800,,113,4.136363636363637
1225571,5,B00000INEX,I love all of Baby Einstein DVDs!! Our children love them also! Would recommend them to anyone! The pictures and music are the best!,1353974400,,132,4.541666666666667
1225572,1,B00000INEX,"The title of this review says it all. The dvd tells how an architect (artist) proposes to decorate the plaza of the Boston city hall with a garden area based on the inspiration of Ma's performance of Bach's music for unaccompanied cello. So what I got was pictures of the proposal, narration (bla-bla-bla) with background of Ma's playing and also episodes of him playing out in the boondocks. I'll bet Ma wishes he'd never got roped into this piece of nonsense. I'll stick to listening and creating my own images, thank you!",1352764800,,524,4.706521739130435
1225573,5,B00000INEX,"Please refer to the review marked,""Goo Goo Ga Ga""; this review describes my experience with Baby Einstein/Baby Beethoven. I have not seen Baby Einstein/Baby Bach (even though I did order it for my granddaughter aged 6 months), but if it's anything like Baby Beethoven, then it's sure to have a mesmerizing effect on her-and the above mentioned review shall apply...",1342137600,,365,5.1
1225594,2,B00000INEX,"After receiving Baby Beethoven as a gift for my daughter, she loved it and we decided to collect them all.  This one, however, is one of the worst.  There's very little activity to keep her attention for long.  Ths little girls in it are cute, but they don't really do much,  I would pick Beethoven & Mozart over this one anyday!",1340150400,,329,4.344262295081967
1225595,2,B00000INEX,I have already bought the Beethoven and Mozart DVD which my daughter loves so I bought the Bach too. We put the disc in a new DVD player and find that it freezes and has digital drop out though-out the playback. Hardly worth the 20 bucks or so that I paid for it. If I wanted bad quality I would have bought a pirated version for $3.,1339459200,,333,3.985074626865672
1225596,2,B00000INEX,This DVD is only 30 minutes....not 172 minutes!  Overall a very great DVD.  My 5 month old loves it.  Was just disappointed as I wanted something a little longer for my car DVD player.,1335484800,,184,4.352941176470588
1225597,4,B00000INEX,"The music is great, as well as the scenery - good for both adults and as an educational video to show kids that play the cello",1335139200,,126,3.8846153846153846
1225598,1,B00000INEX,the video is in poor quality. The content is not good either. I'm very disappointed. don't waste your money on it.,1334707200,,114,4.476190476190476
1225599,1,B00000INEX,"Obviously the reason I bought the DVDs is to listen to Ma's cello performance. It is very annoying that the video is always a few seconds lagging behind the sound. I need to reverse/forward and then pause for a while to get it synchronised, only to find that the video starts to misbehave again after a few minutes.",1309824000,,315,4.448275862068965

1225601,5,B00000INEX,I ordered four Baby Einsten CDs which were used and advertised to be as good as new.  The savings in the purchase was significant compared with the listed price.  All four CDs came in excellent condition as promised.  I intent to use this service again in the near future and recommend to any one like me that is in the market for this merchandise,1306454400,,347,4.390625
1225602,4,B00000INEX,I had looked for this video at all of our retail stores that carry Baby Einstein products and none of them carry it any longer.  My Grandson has all of the other cds and videos.  He also has many of the books and toys.  He loves them...and he really wanted this one!  I ordered it for his birthday.  It came quickly and he was thrilled.  Easy to order and reasonably priced...my kind of toy!,1305158400,,391,4.216216216216216
1225613,5,B00000INEX,"Because of Baby Einstein, my son KNOWS the difference between Bach, Beethoven and Mozart by sound alone. I highly recommend this to any parent.",1293408000,,143,5.0
1225614,5,B00000INEX,"These DVDs are not only educational, they are full of great colours, toys and music that you and your child can share.  In my experience the Baby Bach DVD in particular is great for settling an infant mid-tantrum!",1287532800,,213,4.605263157894737
1225615,1,B00000INEX,"i got this for my 5.5 mo daughter at the suggestion of a cousin. maybe i had high expectations based on the reviews, and the fact that i love classical music, but i don't really get the attraction. my daughter was bored pretty quickly. we'll give it one more try when she's a little older but i think it'll end up in the ""donate"" bin by the end of the year...",1287360000,3,359,4.070422535211268

Only now, they watch it when they want to calm down and relax. I watched it with both children when they were infants and they were always mesmerized and interactive with the music and images.",1277251200,,358,4.188405797101449
1225618,4,B00000INEX,"6 short movies by different film makers each corresponding to 1 of the 6 suites. I loved hearing the cello suites (I had not listened to them all before), although each was separated into the different parts/dances and there is dialogue or other items interspersed between them. I will probably buy the CDs some time. I found the direction the movies/projects took very diverse and interesting, and there was one I did not particularly like. I found the sound of the dialogue in the 5th movie a little too quiet, but that may be deliberate as it has a very visual theme. The 6th with Torvill and Dean is simply stunning. Yo-Yo comes across as such a deep person as well as a musical genius. I am very glad I bought these, and I will be watching them over again... There is some CD-ROM content on the discs which is OK, but to me it was a minor addition - the different interpretations of the suites put into film is fascinating.",1252800000,4,928,4.432748538011696
1225619,5,B00000INEX,I bought this for my new granddaughter and she just stares and smiles.  The color and movement are great.,1240704000,,105,4.526315789473684
1225620,4,B00000INEX,"I haven't seen ""Baby Mozart"" and decided to preview this one before giving it to my granddaughter.  If this one deserves the criticism of some other reviewers, the Mozart video must indeed be terrific.  The arresting images made me think I was watching in HD/Blue Ray yet, despite the visual enhancement, they're all familiar objects, toys, and child faces that should grab the little spectator's attention.  The music, too, is ""enhanced,"" and therein lies a potential problem.  Why must all of Bach's music--piano, organ, orchestral, choral--be played on a soft and echoey synthesizer?  It's all quite enchanting, but how often is Bach, of all composers, ever described as ""enchanting""?

I like the repeated use of Minuet in G, since that's the piece kids taking Suzuki or conventional lessons are likely to play after Twinkle Little Star.  But if Bruce Springsteen's ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" is considered suitable for innocent young ears, Bach deserves to have producers less bent on covering up his authentic authoritative voice.",1229817600,,1040,5.191616766467066
1225621,2,B00000INEX,"My baby loves Baby Beethoven, so we tried Baby Bach for a little variety. Her verdict was... BORING. She won't watch Bach, while she remains riveted to Beethoven. I don't think they did testing to see what would interest babies on this product. I still am a strong proponent of Baby Einstein DVDs, but some are much better than others. Pass on this one.",1229212800,,353,4.53125
1225622,3,B00000INEX,"This dvd is pretty good.  It's not as good as the Baby Mozart, but it's not bad either.  My son will watch it, but I have to keep directing his attention back to it at times.  The music is not as peppy as the Baby Mozart, but Baby Bach is still musical in nature-making it better than all of the other Baby Einstein dvd's we have with the exception of Baby Mozart.",1217980800,,364,4.027777777777778

1225644,5,B00000INEX,"This is a wonderful gift for a new baby -- the music lulls them to sleep, and by the time they reach the ripe old age of 3 months, they will be watching the TV as the shapes go with the music!

1225648,5,B00000INEX,"This is an example of the transcendency of J. S. Bach.  I have read various critical reviews of this DVD and actually agree with some of what is said.  Truly I did not know what I was purchasing--actually thougth it was all Yo Yo and Bach, but it is more like a documentary.  Fortunately there are intact performances of each suite contained in this lengthy DVD.  The menu screen is very confusing and difficult to navigate--that is the only negative I find.  Otherwise I see no harm, and only inspiration in comparing and performing Bach's music to our surroundings, architecture, and the visual arts.  Yes, Yo Yo could have used other examples for comparison, but I do not disagree with the validity of what is stated--some reviewers have called his integrations random, I respectfully disagree.
The perfomances are clean and there are obvious changes of scenery during certain perfomances that required dubbing.  This was done flawlessly and with taste.  Overall this was fun and transcendent.  I suggest listening to other artists perform these suites.  Casals, Rostropovich, and Lynn Harrell all have recordings, and each are different.",1183593600,17,1141,5.086021505376344

He has favorite parts, the animated 'singers' and the live children.  I appreciate that he is listening to Bach even though it may not be an actual symphony playing the music.  I know his mind is being stimulated.  My husband & I watch this with him and tell him what he is looking at to put words with the items.",1175731200,,483,4.172043010752688

1225673,1,B00000INEX,"I *love* Bach and the music selection for this video is hardly any of the best stuff he composed and so dumbed-down that it's downright bad (maybe it's not dumbed-down and the people who arranged it had a different idea for the figured-bass than most others have seen it but it still isn't appeasing to the ears). Also, like I've said in all my reviews of the composer vids, the timing is off for the vid portion and in a Bach video that's just not good. The Mozart vid is far better music wise but I suggest buying the c.d.s and forgoing the vids for this collection altogether.",1165276800,3,579,4.37037037037037

It has no puppets, no songs, no animation, no spoken words, and almost no children in it.  This DVD is just plain boring.  It has nothing but shot after shot of random toys and occasionally a not very attractive child.  There is no continuity from scene to scene and the toys have nothing to do with anything going on.  Baby Bach is pure brain candy with no educational value at all and isn't even interesting enough to watch for half an hour.  One positive about this video though is the music.

It's just music with toys and spinning things; like many of the Baby Einstein videos.  One toy was pretty neat (a spinning top with blue water inside).  Other then that, what really is the point of these videos?  I really don't get it.  I can just imagine my kid wanting all the toys they see.  This video also had some very ugly clown faces in it.

I still don't like most of the Baby Einstein puppets and this video is no exception.  At one point in the video you see a chicken puppet clucking.  Then a you hear a voice that starts to say something and then instead of the chicken you see a little girl (Aspen Clark).  She's apparently telling a joke.  The first time you see and hear this you don't really know what's going on because she starts telling this joke while you still see the chicken puppet.  By the time you understand that it's a girl telling a joke, the joke is half over.  Her question is very difficult to understand.  I had to listen four times to get what she says.  She asks, ""Why did the Mozart get rid of all his chickens?""  Then you hear a squeeky adults voice say, ""Why?""  Aspen then says, ""Because they kept saying Bach, Bach, Bach.""  Then you hear a bunch of adults in the background dying of laughter.  I am sorry but it's lame.  It's very poorly understandable and I don't think any babies or toddlers will even understand this joke.  I don't know why it was included.  At the very end of the video you see Aspen again and she says, ""The video of me is all done?  I'm not the star anymore?"" Again, the adults burst into laughter.  Sorry, I didn't find it funny.  I wonder how Baby Einstien got so popular?  Personally the only ones I like are Baby Neptune (water), Baby Galileo (sky) , Baby Newton (shapes), and Numbers Nursery (counting 1 - 5).

I find it helpful to talk about colors one day, sizes or shapes the next, and music on another day. Granted, I know at 5 months she does not understand exactly what I am telling her, however, I do believe that the earlier shapes, colors, sizes, music, sounds, animals, etc. are introduced and REINFORCED, the more your child will get out of the BE program, and you will get to spend quality educational time with your infant/baby/toddler.

They implicity suggest that by watching their videos, your baby will be exposed to the Mozart Effect and will become a genius overnight.  I am no expert in the psycology of music, but I have a feeling that when they were talking about ""classical music"", they meant REAL classical music and not some dumbed down synthesizer sounds.  The truth is, the videos do work - when you need a break in the day, your baby will watch them and fall into a trance.  But you might as well stick them in front of a test pattern or the drying laundry for that matter.  If you're interested in real classical music, I'd just pick up some real classical music CDs and play them while your child plays.  If you HAVE to get a video for some peace in the day, I've always thought Juno Baby did a very nice job (but they're not really available anywhere which is a bit annoying too) or Fantasia (if you can sit through an entire motion picture).  But, if you do watch any of these videos, I've always found it best to interact with your baby while watching - move to the rhythm of the music, dance and hum along, etc.  I understand the need for a break in the day, but these videos can be put to good developmental use too.",1101686400,6,1290,4.279835390946502

Well that happened so I decided to get her a DVD. I bought this one but I am SO happy I did not pay this much for it.

First off I have to say my daughter likes it. Why she does, I cant understand. Its a low production quality DVD with the most cheap looking ""puppets"" you can imagine. I really couldn't believe that this is what everyone had been so excited over. These are toys set to classical music. The music isn't even real instruments its synthesized and cheap sounding.

I had been playing her classical music since I was pregnant and I love it myself. But this is so cheap sounding.

Anyway it really doesnt matter what I think, its not for me. She likes it and is completely enthralled.

They don't seem to bother Six-month-old, though, and neither does the shoddy digital editing that makes the robots look so pixelley to me.

Got this?  Return it.  It's a shame to think some people are going to see this as their first Baby Einstein experience.  The best parts of the series are the varied toys moving across the screen and the playful puppets.  In this video it's just pictures of the toys.  They don't move.  You could play Bach on your stereo and flip through a magazine and have a better experience - at least the magazine only cost $3.  The puppeteer in this series is apparently a moron.  They don't do anything!  I have a sneaking suspicion they had exactly one hour to video tape this - how else can you explain in huge difference in this video from the others?

The only real drawback is that I don't approve of the way the older child is flattered on this video.  She's encouraged to see herself as the ""star"" and gets big laughs for every comment she makes.

Granted, the music is great -- how could it not be?  But to pair such masterpieces with commercial toys in a very clumsy and amateurish video production and call this educational is an abomination!  Really, the only purpose that I see to this pairing is pure and simple -- money.  They want you to buy all the toys.  And after watching this over and over, your kids will beg you to go out and buy them!  Now are the toys really that bad?  Probably not, but for a production that prides itself solely on its educational value, then why are we all subjected to one big commercial for all of these products?  (I find it very interesting that at the end of the video, the narrator/creator tells us exactly where we can buy all of the toys -- hmmm, what is she getting in return for this ""free"" advertising?)
This series had great potential, and does expose kids to classical music(thus the 2 stars).  My two nieces (8 months and 3 years) are mesmerized when they watch it. Entertaining?  Perhaps. But is it educational?  Not in my book. Just think what it would have been like if the creator had paired the music with swirling abstract colors, shapes, and lines, like Disney's ""Fantasia"" where characters morph into abstractions to emulate and support the idea that music is an abstract form of communication.  Or even if they showed people actually playing instruments to make the connection between what is heard and how the music is produced.

I think the best two in this series is the animal ones: Neighborhood and World Animals, but Baby Bach is very good as well.
In this video there are toys in motion to Bach's music. The toys are stuffed animals, trains, action toys. The motion of the toys fits very well to the music, which is superb. I am surprised my daughter will sit the entire 25 minutes to this tape. I think the quality of these Baby Einstein videos is remarkable.

1225870,2,B00000INEX,"I agree with the other reviewers, Baby Mozart is the best of the series.  The problem with Baby Bach, Baby Santa's Music Box (the two others I have seen so far) is that there are scenes with children in them.  My daughter is not at all interested in the people scenes for some reason.  She loves all the movement and all the toys, and in the Bach series, there simply aren't as many moving toy scenes.  (Same goes for Baby Santa which is definitely the WORST of Baby Einstein.)
I think the thing that bothers me the most about Baby Bach is that Julie Clark puts her children in it, and frankly, I find it to be the MOST annoying part of the show, thank goodness it's only for a few minutes.  Trying too hard to be cutesy, believe me, it's not at all cute.
In buying the Baby Einsten tapes / DVDs (in general) I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at my daughters reaction.  She is captivated by the (moving) scenery, it's amazing to see a five month old so interested, I almost want to videotape her watching it, yes it's that cute.  And I think you will be thrilled, too, when you see your child interact.

That said, it is still a nice video and does offer a nice alternative to Baby Mozart.  Our girl can get a bit bored with it, look down and begin playing with something, and then have a certain scene pop up that she enjoys and she'll be drawn back to watching it for a short period.
Some folks have complained a bit about Julie Aigner-Clark putting her kids in the video.  Well, to be honest, I actually like them in it.  I think most babies enjoy looking at other babies and children, and whenever they pop on the screen, my girl tends to drop what she is doing and watch them.  So I can forgive Aigner-Clark's seeming indulgence.  Hey, these videos are for your baby, not you, and babies don't care whose kids are in the video...they like watching them!
The other features of the DVD are nothing special.  My guess is they are rarely used (though I did do the reading feature with my 9-month old the other day, and she was somewhat transfixed with the images even if she is clueless about the words being said).

Several months ago we returned the DVDs and I found I really missed the music from Bach.  It turned out, so did my son. Since he has  become a busy explorer, the videos (including Mozart to a degree)have not been able to hold his interest for long. In addition, he will not watch anything else on the TV -- no other shows capture his interest.  But when I purchased the Bach DVD for him, he was instantly captivated and has been ever since.  I know he remembered it.  While I'm not as thrilled with the content as I am with some of the others (Mozart and both Doolittles especially) I know that my son loves watching the little girls dance and play. I choose to believe that he will learn from their movements as much as he might from the actions of the toys and the music.
I highly recommend all of the videos, but Baby Bach and Mozart are by far the best choices for little babies.",1015804800,6,1374,4.27027027027027

Seriously, this is a good video.  It has less music than does the Baby Mozart DVD, and it isn't as good as holding my daughter's attention, even though the format is the same.  What can I say, I prefer Mozart as a composer also.  Still, it is a nice diversion and a good introduction to classical music.",1012867200,,347,4.3076923076923075
1225917,2,B00000INEX,"After we realized our son liked the Baby Mozart DVD, we decided to purchase more in the series. Being huge classical music fans we decided Baby Bach was the next logical choice. We are rather disappointed with Baby Bach, though. For one, our son (who is almost 1) doesn't seem at all interested in it (and it's not that he doesn't like Bach; he has the Pipe toy and loves to play with it - I've also written a review of that in the Toys area). Secondly, and this is probably just my personal bias, but there's just waaaay too much of the Clark children talking and dancing - it really interrupted the flow. Regarding the flow in general, the whole Theatre presentation seemed just thrown together: clumsy, illogical transitions and lots of extraneous sounds. I would recommend folks skip this one - if you get it as a gift, see if your child likes it, but don't spend the money yourself.",1012780800,21,887,4.481481481481482

My daughter knows when the opening credits come on the TV that her video is getting ready to play and she will stop whatever she's doing and stand in front of the TV to watch (or when the jammies are on she wants to sit in our lap for snuggle time).

The music really vibrated through the speakers, even at low volume.  The makers of this video went out to a novelty gift store to buy the props for this video (lightning ball, rainbow strobe, back-flipping dog, etc.), which made it seem cheap from an adult perspective.
Fortunately, my 3-month-old baby has not yet developed very discerning tastes.  He watches the video quietly and seems to enjoy it.

The music is pleasant (can't beat the classics!), the colors are enticing, the skits short enough to hold her attention, and always educational.  She learned many words based upon objects within this video series.

I started playing the video when he was two months old.  He would watch it and gradually dozed off, but two parts consistently woke him up.  The ""Cluck cluck cluck"" of toy chickens, and the ""clank clank clank"" of coins being dropped into a metal bank.  I continued playing the video until he was three and a half months old, but have given up on it for the moment.
If only the volume had been softened on these two parts, we would have enjoyed the video more.  My son did seem to like to look at the faces of the toddlers, so that part did not bother me.
I received a free CD which had the cluck-cluck-cluck, clank-clank-clank and children's laughter eliminated.  He enjoys listening to the CD on road trips.

 I agree that the dragon puppet at the beginning was startling to her when she first watched the tape -- but once she got used to it, it didn't even faze her and I think she actually finds it entertaining now. Maybe watch it with your child the first few times and give her a chance to get used to it.
 I find it interesting that other reviewers have complained about the segments featuring Julie Aigner-Clark's children -- my daughter is very interested in other children and really enjoys those parts.
 I highly recommend both Baby Bach and Baby Mozart -- it's a delight to see my baby get so much enjoyment out of watching them.",995760000,10,810,4.496598639455782

There's nothing babies love better than watching other babies, and Baby Bach delivers by showing footage of babies and children playing and singing in between the toy performances. Some of my kids' favorites in Baby Bach: the robots, colored blobs floating around in water, and of course, puppets that surprise without frightening.",992131200,,613,5.14
1225985,4,B00000INEX,"I've had this video and some of the other ones in the series for a couple years now, and my two-and-a-half-year-old son still enjoys it occasionally. When he was very young he was extremely colicky, and sometimes I couldn't do anything to make him stop crying. I discovered that the soothing music and images in this video would very often calm him down. Also, when he was older and would awaken from a nightmare this video was useful in helping him to calm down, more than just sitting with him quietly, because it provided a calming distraction.
Besides that, my son really enjoyed watching the video, from before he could sit up until the present, when he can talk about what he is seeing. It shows a fun variety of toys and shapes, which can also serve as a preview of the toys so you can find out which ones you think your child might like to play with.
From a parent's perspective, the segments with the kids in it  are sort of annoying, and didn't hold my son's interest as much as the other parts of the video, which is why I only gave this 4 stars.",984441600,,1057,4.338383838383838
1225986,1,B00000INEX,"In a certain sense, as a Bach fanatic, I support anything that exposes kids to his music.  So my 1-star rating is a bit awkward in that light.  However, I think it well worth pointing out that the music of Bach needs no video embellishment to captivate a child's attention.  As a toddler, I was given cassette tapes of Bach's music, and listened to them constantly.  In a very real sense, from about age 1 1/2 to 6 I lived *inside* the Brandenburg concertos, preludes, and fugues, and the immersive experience has irrevocably enhanced and deepened my perception and enjoyment of music to this day.  So, consider allowing your child to focus on the marvelous harmonic intricacy of Bach without the concurrent distraction of an irrelevant stream of baby photos and implicit toy ads.  Who knows? Maybe (s)he will grow up appreciating such music as more than mere auditory ""scenery"" (to which category Baroque music has largely been relegated in American society).",983318400,2,960,4.895061728395062

My  principal objection is to the static shots of various musical instruments  accompanied by snatches of music that could not have possibly issued from  those pictured. To my mind it would have been more interesting to show  individuals playing those instruments.  There is a certain lifelessness to  the video as a whole increased by an echo chamber quality in some of the  music and voices.  Still, there just aren't that many videos out there for  kids that can't yet talk so I don't want to be overly critical. As far as  the frequent footage of producer's daughters...well it certainly provides  us parents with a warning that what we may find simply adorable in our  children just might be grating to others.

As for the creator's daughters appearing in this video more  than the others, well our son loves those parts.  He laughs and shrieks  with joy when he see them.
