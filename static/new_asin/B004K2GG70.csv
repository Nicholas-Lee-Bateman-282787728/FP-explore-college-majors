8432131,4,B004K2GG70,"I liked The Ancient Dogoo Girls, even more than I did the first series. The series has just the right mix of comedy and drama. Plus all the girls are really cute, especially busty Erika Yazawa, who returns to the series.",1373846400,,220,4.390243902439025
8432132,4,B004K2GG70,"I did enjoy watching this weird show, I bought this because I am a fan of Rina Takeda,she really knows how to fight, but it is a strange show,and the english subtitles are  bad, not saying the show is bad, it is a fun show, I liked it.",1339286400,,235,3.8958333333333335
8432133,4,B004K2GG70,"Season 1 has just 1 Dogoo & she is pretty sexy, even when she is fighting the giant ""Bee Girl"" as she captures her in her Chest.  Season II has not 1 but, 6 Sexy Dogoo Girls to save the day. Has each girl is sexier then the next fighting all kinds of monsters & demons to save the day. Both season are quite funny & have 2 dvd's each in a box. I would recommend you start off with season 1 to see how she comes to this world & then in season 2 how she is reborn.  This is really not for Children under 12. But if you like live action stuff like"" the power rangers"" (only thing that comes to mind at the moment.)But more sexier Then Live action girl(s) in a princess layer type costume fighting monster w/ a plastic sword w/ a little robot partner who identify all the monsters who they are & where they come from is for you. Not to mention Very Poor English subtitles (that half the time don't make sense) but who's watching it for that!!  Worth it if you a fan of this kind of live action stuff.  I give this both season I-II 4 out of 5
