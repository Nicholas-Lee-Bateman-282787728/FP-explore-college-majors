174716,5,0988668106,The DVDs go with the workbook to learn of God's holiness and majesty. We need to truly behold God as He is and we need to see ourselves in light of His magnificience! To God be the glory!!,1446768000,4,188,3.973684210526316
174717,5,0988668106,"This is one of the best teachings about who G-d is and what He expects of us.  It is, also, a good lesson on what will bring people into a relationship with G-d through Jesus.  The church is trying to SELL G-d to people.  What they don't understand that it is G-d and G-d alone that adds to the church people who need Him.  We need only worship Him and tell people who G-d is.  All our human efforts have not produced a great revival in the church.  I think every pastor, who is earnest about reaching people for Jesus, should view this study.",1443484800,6,543,4.173076923076923
174718,5,0988668106,"""What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.""

Our men's group just completed this DVD and workbook study, into rethinking God, as He describes Himself, and as He is described, by the Biblical writers and servants of God who have come before.  In the course of your Christian walk with the Lord, periodically, it is important to rethink our views of God, and to see God as He really is, Highly Exalted, The Holy One, who lives high above.  He dwells in two places, on high, and in the hearts of the broken and contrite spirit.  Get reacquainted with the God of the Bible, from theologians and pastors who will help you to view the Almighty God as clearly as is humanly possible.  This is the type of study that will change your life, if you can find a quiet place somewhere in your home, and open your heart and mind to truly seeking God, not popular misconceptions of Him, but in seeing God as He truly is!  .""The desperate need of the hour is a fresh encounter with the Living God, who is High and Lofty, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy.""",1432771200,6,1094,4.364532019704433
174719,5,0988668106,"Excellent resource for an examination of our perspective regarding what we think about God. Who does God say He is, versus who do we say he is, or want Him to be?  If we know God in the way He has revealed Himself in the scriptures, then the series asks, (in the words of Dr. Francis Schaffer,) ""How then ought we to live?""  It is truly a study of the God of the Bible.  Exhaustive, of course not, but then nothing could ever be when we are learning about The Almighty God, and this is only a 12 week study.  This is one of several studies my family and I have undertaken to draw closer to our God and I can say without reservation that it will draw you closer to having the mind of Christ, than you would be without it . . . significantly. My household is amazingly changed forever because we chose to ""behold our God.""",1431129600,12,820,4.138364779874214
174720,1,0988668106,"Some of the men did this at the church I attend.  They roped me into it.  It's a woefully incomplete picture of God with boring lecture material.  The teacher is poor and inconsistent logically.  For example in one video he says don't read books other than the Bible and then goes on to state that it's really only puritan writers that are permissible.  No surprise, he has his doctorate in puritan literature or something similar.  I was shocked when a friend of mine, who's a pastor, asked me what I thought of it.  I told him I didn't think it was good at all and I thought it left people pursuing knowledge rather than God.  He went on to tell me that he was warned that it was poison for a church. I could see that I guess.  Really left me feeling like Dr. Snyder is really really scared of God, but hasn't quite figured out how to be in love with God.  My experience is that it's mostly older men who have not had a solid relationship with God who really eat this stuff up.  Makes them feel smart, but I haven't seen positive fruit from it.  TLDR:  This is recycled Tozer in a terrible format.  Just get some AW Tozer and you'll be way ahead in your understanding of God.",1425081600,7,1177,4.243243243243243

7795355,2,0988668106,"I do not recommend this study. We are working our way through John Snyders Behold your God workbook. We have finished week seven. Just over half the group found John Snyder to be judgmental of his readers, the church today and other Christian authors in a recurrent way. The group is newly formed but the members are mature in their faith. We are persevering but looking towards the next study. I have found John Snyder to be inconsistent and illogical in his points. His writing style uses the second person making him appear accusatory whether that is his intention or not . He introduces new phrases or terms without defining them. He mixes metaphors. Some of his analysis is extra biblical. Having said this, about one half of our group loved the study, some of the others simply overlooked the negative placing their hopes in the next study. If you are looking for a study that your whole group will enjoy , keep looking. To THE Discerning Reviewer, I will now exit the building.",1517788800,,984,4.660919540229885
7795356,5,0988668106,"The first video class was hard to wrap my mind around and sounded complicated, but then I started the daily lessons and my perception completely changed! The video classes will make a ton more sense if you do the study every day as well. I've already seen God convict me in certain areas and help me change. He the one our focus should be on in every area of life! When we focus on who He really is our actions change, our thoughts change, our understanding of sin changes, etc. We need Him! Nothing else.",1508803200,,505,4.326315789473684

7795362,5,0988668106,"Fabulous study!  If you are seeking God and looking to know WHO God really IS, this is very helpful.  It is completely God centered, directing you to scripture, learning from God himself, not relying on human knowledge or opinion.  What this study really boils down to, in my opinion, is this main idea;  Accepting God is the introduction.  KNOWING God is everything... Knowing WHO He is, what He is like, discovering characteristics that God has stated about Himself.  This study helped to highlight things that I had failed to notice about what God says about Himself as to who He is.",1464134400,3,586,4.752475247524752
7795363,2,0988668106,"Wow was this a disappointment.  The accompanying faith heroes were done adequately but then the video moves to a classroom setting and, believe me, you better know how you are going to use this material.  It is strident, often negative, always doctrinaire and will bury the listener to the point that you just feel like hitting the pause button.  We were going to use this series as a summer series in a expatiate English speaking church with Presbyterian connections.  Not going to happen.",1460246400,5,490,4.867469879518072
