7383393,3,B0145NSQGW,"I must say, I generally everything Leslie does, but this DVD is (for me) a miss. It feels very contrived.
Leslie spends too much time wandering around the walkers and chatting/laughing instead of leading the walk.
A few of the walkers are downright distracting with their exaggeration of the movements (and it causes them to be out of step which then confuses everyone and looks very shoddy on camera).
The incessant ""woooo!""s and random commentary really detracts from the workout and its evident that it distracts Leslie from doing what she does best- actively leading the walk without missing a beat.
I wish the walkers didn't have microphones. It really takes away from the experience.
Will you get a decent workout from this DVD? Yes, as long as you can put up with all of the above for an hour and twenty minutes.",1447372800,12,819,4.734265734265734
7383394,4,B0145NSQGW,"I've been exercising with Leslie's videos for about 5 years.  I own a dozen of her videos.  This video is very good.  I did all five miles and was not bored for even a moment.  She has a fun group of walkers, decent music and her talking, though exuberant, isn't excessive like in some of her other videos. It's always great to see Nick at 6 A.M.  Yes, he could be my son, but who cares!  I had a good workout.  I added hand weights to two of the miles to up the intensity and add a bit of toning.  I'm very happy with this video.",1447372800,45,530,3.9339622641509435
7383395,2,B0145NSQGW,Love the workout but didn't like how it was recorded.  It made me dizzy and it's blurry when everyone moves from side to side.,1447286400,2,126,4.25
7383396,5,B0145NSQGW,"Fun!  There were lots of costume changes, familiar and new faces, new music, which kept the workout interesting.  I got a great workout because I could boost (high impact aerobics) when I wanted to, or I could choose not to boost (low impact aerobics).  The complete 5 miles lasted about 72 minutes, but the exericser can choose 1 mile, 2 miles, etc, up to 5 total miles.  It was well worth the money.  I'm a huge fan of Leslie Sansone.",1447286400,17,436,4.4
7383397,5,B0145NSQGW,"Leslie great !!! This training is the most beautiful that I had and I have them all walk at home!

7383400,5,B0145NSQGW,"Good workout for the ""seasoned"" walkers and well as those who are just starting their walk at home journey.  I like that I can get in a longer workout without having to start each mile with an extended warm up.  The time goes by very quickly.",1447200000,8,242,4.239130434782608
7383401,5,B0145NSQGW,"This isn't like a HITT or intense intervals like in her last 5 Mega Miles DVD. Boost simply means you're amplifying some of the moves. She even has an optional video where she'll show beginners how to boost a move, like side-step, skater, etc. So, if you're new to Leslie, I'd first watch that video she has at the bottom of other menu options. But she'll have one person do a low impact version.

Wish I knew which one. :p

--Mile 1--
Leslie is in a room with four other people. Nick and Nadia are the only two familiar faces. They were wearing yellow-schemed apparel, which does change throughout the miles. Following with a gentle warm up, the next song introduces a boost, or gentle jog. This doesn't last long. Remember, it's not like a HITT. Then there's boosted-kick, Mini-squat-arm-reach, and then at the end of the mile, she'll do another boosted move. There is also a really fast song in this one.

The music here was nice, but it kind of faded in and out. Some of the music you'll recognize from Walking Off Pounds DVD.

--Mile 2--
The music quality sounded much better with a good balance of her voice. There are new people, with Rocky and Wendy as familiar faces. There was a guy in the back who appeared very distracting at first, becuase anytime he moved, he HAD to put rhythm into it to where he was the oddest-moving person. But then I thought, why not enjoy a gentle spirit? There aren't' enough happy people like him anyway. After a while you might even have a laugh with the way he moves.

Some moves involve Boost w/ 8-step,  Skater, Single knee-double knee pattern, and boosted-kick.

--Mile 3--
Immediately, she'll have you do a gentle shift and then boosts the shift into side punches. There's tapback with swing arms, skater, another normal boost, cha-cha, and leg swing. There was a full squat she kind of stuck in there randomly, which kind of made it seem like it was more out of place.

All of the walkers are reunited in this mile and through the rest. It got very noisy by this mile and you'll feel their energy. There is a fast song in this one.

--Mile 4--
Bouncing, 4-step-shift, 4-step-4-kick, boosted-mambo, boosted-8-step, skater, and she'll do lots of mini-squats but in various ways.
Fast song.

--Mile 5--
Kick-back with cross-pulldown, step-tap, grapevine, sit-and-kick (also felt out of place), step-knee (boost), and modify skater.

This round was more relaxed, followed by a somewhat average cool down, also rushed. But even through the stretch, that guy STILL couldn't stop moving. He HAD to dance with the music. If he couldn't move his body through the stretch, he'd sure bob his head. And at this point, it just got hilarious.

Overall, impressive DVD, but I don't think it beats her 5 mega miles. THAT one will get you wishing it was over.",1447113600,97,3015,4.602611940298507
7383402,4,B0145NSQGW,I LOVE this dvd and I own quite a few of hers. I love that you can choose which miles that you want to do. My only critique is that I wish you could select more then 1 mile at a time. It's either 1 at a time OR all 5 miles. I love the variety each mile brings and how you have the option to boost certain moves or not too.,1530403200,,322,3.486111111111111

And if my fitbit is to be believed, the calorie burn is similar to running four miles. Really worth it -- and by far her best dvd that I own.",1528588800,,487,3.84

We like her program because it doesn't require great dance ability, but this video seems to lean heavily on dance moves.  And we have to agree with those reviewers who did not like all of the messing around during the workout. Too much talking over the instructor, doing whatever you want, and just in general not paying the program the respect it deserves.  We struggle with following along and get annoyed by all of the playing around.  Please get a Leslie Sansone video to help you exercise- they are great!

7383430,5,B0145NSQGW,I love this workout. I started with her walk for seniors as Im 68 years old. Then I moved up to a 3 mile walk and then the 5 boosted mile. This is a fast workout and if your older should not start with this one. I am looking for another fast walk similar to this for a little variation Could anyone recommend one.,1519776000,,313,3.90625
7383431,5,B0145NSQGW,"I love 5 Boosted Miles.  All the standard moves plus pendulum, skater, squats and boosted moves keep things interesting. There are five 15 minute segments, all of which include a mix of low impact and high impact (boosted) moves. A low impact option is demonstrated if you want to keep it low. You can choose to play individual segments or use the Play All option depending on the time you have. If I only have 45 min then I would probably choose to do ""HIIT Radio Remixes"" instead as this is a personal favourite.  But I love that, if I have the time, this DVD gives me 75 minutes of energetic exercise. It certainly gets the blood pumping (I'm reasonably fit for my age but I'm nearly 58 so perhaps a younger person would find it less tiring). Leslie's chatting doesn't bother me on this DVD but there is a music only option. One of the team, Michael, provides his own take on the moves.  I quite often do this myself so don't mind this at all, but some other reviewers have found this annoying.

The only cons are really just cosmetic: the dark grey walls suck the energy from the room, and just looking at Leslie jumping around in long pants and long sleeves is enough to make me overheat.  Ignore these and it's great.",1519689600,,1223,4.393805309734513
7383432,5,B0145NSQGW,"This is my all time favorite Sansone video! And I have quite a collection. The music is very energizing and the walkers are really having fun. A friend and I have been walking three days a week and are seeing results. We do the five miles and it goes quickly. These videos show that keeping in pace with the music is what you need to do even if you don't do the arm movements or choose to do low impact while some do higher impact, its okay. Just keep moving and it gets easier with time.",1519516800,,488,4.09375
7383433,5,B0145NSQGW,This is my favorite DVD-I really like the group & it makes you have fun while you're sweating-I have most of her DVD's & love them all-I don't care if she chats-it makes you feel like you're working out with a friend withe some laughs & fun & great sweat!!,1519516800,,256,4.14

Her workout doesn't bother me, pretty much the same old...

But, she stops walking to point out how the other walkers are walking.  UGH!!!!  I don't appreciate that or need her to do this for me.

Leslie, if you are reading this... It's annoying to see you STOP walking.  Seems like you can't keep up with your own walking video.

I might just have to give this one away.",1518307200,,451,4.211764705882353

7383437,5,B0145NSQGW,"This DVD includes 5 mile walks and a bonus segment where Leslie shows you how to boost her different walk moves. By the time I got to doing 5 miles in my fitness regimen, I was familiar enough with Leslies workouts to know how to boost them so I didn't need the bonus part. This is one of my favorite workout DVDs  because of the ability to boost the moves with Leslie. I have found that doing four out of the five miles (I usually skip mile 2 since that is my least favorite of the five) is a good hour long workout. As with all of Leslies workouts, you can modify it to fit your fitness level and I like that she has a walker do low impact so that you can follow that person if you need to do low impact exercises. There is a music only feature for each mile but I have found that I like getting Leslies warnings about upcoming moves. I vary my workout DVDs so I do not have every move memorized. This workout DVD is in my permanent collection and I workout with it regularly.",1517443200,,978,4.067357512953368

I have walked at home with Leslie Sansone for years, and recently have been looking for a little more energy in the walks. This is it! The 5 Boosted Miles is exactly that...Boosted! It is a high energy program that powers up the standard walk at home series. There are a variety of moves that I have not seen on other walking programs and they have walkers for any fitness level. Follow along with the low impact walker for a good heart pumping walk, boost it up with several of the other walkers or modify somewhere in between. With five different miles (the cool-down coming at 1:06 in the full 5 mile walk), it's easy to customize the walking program that fits your schedule. This is absolutely the change I needed in my walk. I work up a good sweat with all five miles, but get an equally energized walk with just 2 or 3 miles. Love the boosted moves, the energy, the music and, of course, Leslie's positive spirit! I highly recommend this to everyone!",1517097600,3,1034,4.50531914893617

7383456,4,B0145NSQGW,"I have at least 3-4 of her other DVDs.  Yes, it's true.  There are not many new moves in this one, but there are only so many moves one can perform.  Overall, I like this program because she explains how one can ""boost"" certain exercises.  If you have never used Leslie Sansone's DVDs, some of the movements may take a second for you to catch on.

I liked this DVD because it was much faster than her other DVDs.  May be the music is faster in this one because individuals can ""customize"" the exercises by ""boosting"" them, i.e. jogging in place versus walking in place.  While the overall music selection is not great, I still think it's a pretty good workout.

I read one review where the reviewer stated that the people backing up Leslie seemed to be doing their own thing and that that was a distraction. I get that reviewer's point but it did not bother me because Leslie frequently said that this is a customizable program.  Her walkers were tailoring her exercises based on their physical level.  I just focused on Nick; Nick is always consistent and does a good job of following Leslie's commands.

There were only 2 real ""issues,"" if you want to call them that.  The camera work and editing were a bit sloppy.  There were times when the camera would swing to a different angle and you could hear Leslie but could not see her.  Then the camera person(s) would focus on someone doing their own thing so I imagine that might confuse someone who has never used one of Leslie's DVDs.  I think that a better job could have been done on the editing.  The second issue was Michael, one of the walkers.  I would start to crack up when the camera would pan to him because HE was really marching to his own drummer.  He kind of was following Leslie, but not really.  He made me laugh because he seemed to be having so much funny and he was just goofy.  I couldn't tell if his wife, who is also in the video, was doing her best to do her own thing because she knows how he is or if she was just embarrassed so she was ignoring him.  Either way, I was both amused and slightly distracted by Michael.

I think this program is more intense than her other DVDs, but I still think it's good for beginners.  Just do the less impact versions of the exercises.  If you just either pay attention to Leslie or Nick, you'll be fine.  I still would recommend this DVD.",1504656000,4,2352,4.339449541284404

I still get a good workout but I usually do this workout with a weighted vest, which gives me that extra burn.  I have her 5 mega miles, which i like because of the strength training segments but I was hoping for a more challenging 5 mile walk.

If you can only do normal then do normal.  I find that I am usually able to do the very short boosts.  I like the music because it's more rhythm than songs.  New move on that, for me, was the skater  It's a bumped up side step and it's awesome.  I could do the five miles in one shot if I wanted, and if I had the time.  But, I split it up and do 3 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon.  Don't know about getting skinny but I feel great.",1501027200,3,607,3.814516129032258

7383464,5,B0145NSQGW,No complicated steps. No ridiculous moves that make you feel awkward. Only consistent pace and movements that get you sweating quickly regardless of your current level of fitness. You do have to put in effort and you do have to build up to getting use to it but once you do you will feel it & will enjoy working out to this. Theres more to it than walking but its not overkill. You burn calories and you sweat and its easy to stick with because the moves aren't making you trip over yourself & you're able to go through the entire video with confidence.,1499558400,,553,4.326923076923077

Either way, you get an excellent workout. It's a lot of fun and everyone in it seems to be very upbeat and having a lot of fun. Some of the other reviews said that Michael was annoying,  but I just thought he seemed like a fun guy. He's not in every mile and the ones that he is in you don't see him the whole time. Just don't watch him to keep your pace though because he kind of does his own thing. No big deal. You can customize your workout to which miles you want to do. I highly recommend this one!

I also don't like that you can't pick which miles to play, so if you are doing less than all 5 or want to do them in a different order, you have to stop and fiddle with the remote after each mile.  That said, I now use this video a lot.  You can boost the moves even when she doesn't (or just jog all the walking parts) for a tougher workout, and at least some of the music has grown on me.  I don't use mile 1 (which includes the warmup) because it is just too slow and boring for me.",1490572800,2,661,3.8308823529411766

This has great moves and I love the balance of boosted and low impact.  Leslie had some real good workout teammates and that Nick is especially engaging.  The camera loves him and he makes you want to try harder.  I don't know what the director was thinking, did say do what ever you can to distract and have the camera focus on you or if she was napping.  I am all for putting your own spin on things and having fun especially in a class but on camera it becomes distracting and some moves he, Michael, did could cause injury.  I bet he is a fun guy in person.  The fifth mile Leslie was too focused on him.  After I turned off the instructions and did the workout I could look away and not get agitated.

While I liked the workouts available on YouTube, my body quickly grew used to them and so I began a search for something more sweat-inducing. I do Shaun T's T-25 and Insanity as well, so on the days I don't do those hard workouts I wanted something active but not so hard since I'm sore from the other workouts.

I love this DVD! I like that you can mix and match however many miles you want to do and which types of miles you want to do also -- you can do 1,3,5 or 2,3,1 or 4,5,1 -- but the only downside is there isn't a separate option for a cooldown on the DVD menu. Other than that -- Leslie is her usual energetic self, the walkers are smiley and into the workout, and you will sweat if you push yourself!

7383503,5,B0145NSQGW,"Leslie Sansone, thank you so much!  Her routines are so easy, you will not believe you are losing weight and getting in shape.  She is not commando exercising, there is no holding it, wait for the burn, wait for the pain, no none of that.  There is no complicated foot work learning dance steps, putting it all together and start from the top.  This is not a class.  This is a group of friends that just come together and move quickly for a mile, a couple of miles or if you really good 5 miles or so!  You can pick and choose which miles.  I have lost nearly 35 pounds with her tapes.  All I want to know is when is the next tape coming out.  I have practically all of her tapes, going back to vhs!  She works every muscle and at the same time you can go at your own pace.  You do not have to learn all sorts of dance moves, it's just steps. You are walking in place and kicking, stepping, lifting your legs, twisting side to side to develop that hour glass and some more stuff and before you know it, you're done!  She always has a mixed group of folks working out with her of varying sizes and ages and it works especially on those mornings when you just don't feel like being bothered to get up.  It's as if you are all working out together and she makes it fun.  I'm not too fond of her solo miles, but I don't consider that a hindrance at all.  She talks you thru the entire tape, you will either like it or not, but I think it's great.  She talks over the music as well, but that too is fine because she gives good info and you can still keep the beat.  And what I love most about her tapes is no matter what the move is, as long as you keep the beat, you are still losing weight.  I cannot rate her highly enough.",1483660800,7,1721,4.011764705882353

7383508,5,B0145NSQGW,Love love love!! Leslie nailed it with this workout! Mile 1 is typical warm up and mile 5 is cool down- both are pretty slow paced but miles 2 through 4 are my favorites. She picks up the speed in mile 2 and then takes off in 3 and 4.  Really great way to start the day. I am not a morning person but try to get some aerobics in before work. Hard core aerobics first thing in the morning is not my thing - I need simple. This is it! Each mile increases in pace with options to up the intensity. I hope this dvd is indication of where she is going with her future DVDs because if it is I will buy every one of them! My only suggestion would be to eliminate the slow pace of mile 1 and start the workout the speed of mile 2. Mile 1 is just too slow for me. I would love a 5 mile DVD starting with pace of this mile 2 with the remaining miles matching intensity of miles 3&4 for the duration of the workout with a cool down of last mile.

7383530,4,B0145NSQGW,"I have a number of Leslie's tapes and I like this one as it is more aerobic than some. I often add 'boosted moves' to the other tapes to increase my heart rate, but it is nice to have it incorporated within the walk itself. The bonus section detailing how to boost is worth a look and can translate to all manner of exercises. Comments about Michael were amusing--his sheer joy didn't bother me though he definitely is dancing to a different drummer. Playing the entire tape took about 72 minutes total, and you really need to do mile 5 as it includes the cool down (and much less strenuous than the rest). My favorite Leslie tapes are the Hiit ones (favorites, radio, party) since the music makes them fun and the time pass quickly, but I vary among all of hers (and others--Chris Freytag is also a favorite).",1473897600,,810,4.442953020134228
7383531,3,B0145NSQGW,I have probably 8 - 10 of Leslie's videos dating back to when she first began.  The only thing I like about this one is the walk itself.  I don't listen to it and I try not to watch too much because the people she has walking with her seem to think they are celebrities...a few of them don't even do the walking they are supposed to be doing and Leslie runs around giggling at them.  It's just silly and distracting...bring back your old style videos with real people who aren't interested in seeing themselves on a video and please get back to your pleasant teaching style.,1473724800,,574,4.345794392523365

She's terrific!!  I also use Denise Austin and Jane Fondas videos and they are fine, but I find Leslie's DVD's to be the best for me right now.  The only things I would like that isn't included is to be able to set a custom workout.  She has a warm up at the beginning and no cooldown until the 5th mile so if you don't do the whole thing, you have to stop the DVD and go over to whatever mile you want to do and then to the cool down section.  Also, there is a guy who does more dancing than working out and although it was cute at first, I find him very annoying and distracting - but not enough to make me not want to do this DVD!

I own most of them, so I really enjoy the refreshing change pace in this one. Some reviewers have also said that this workout isn't boosted. Yes it is. The DVD starts out at a faster pace from the very beginning. There are a few newer moves that really bump up the intensity. When I feel unsure of some of the moves I just jog in place during those parts. By the 4th mile I'm feeling muscle fatigue, but I push myself to the end.

7383546,5,B0145NSQGW,"i have foot issues and was looking for a very low impact kind of home exercise video - i am so glad i found leslie sansone and now have several of her videos - for me they are perfect - i use them when i can't get to my exercise class for whatever reason or on days when i'm not in class and just want a good cardio workout - (also purchased the diamond anti fatigue flooring so i wouldn't be walking on concrete which has helped tremendously)
pros:  -  a lot of the same people are in the videos - i feel like i'm in an aerobics class!
  -  the pacing - mile markers - i prefer them
  -  the videos are not same old same old and sometimes i switch out the videos just for a total change
  -  the variety of movements
  - i can walk/jog at my own pace
  - videos are broken up into segments so i can continue on or stop when i need to and stretch on my own for the cool down
  - very upbeat and just fun to do
  - my body feels great afterwards and my feet don't hurt!
  - time just seems to go by so quickly
cons:  - not the best music (sometimes one piece of music goes on and on for a long time) but she has explained that research
  went into selecting the music for pacing so i'm generally okay with it

the videos offer a good solid cardio low impact workout - you can adapt it to whatever works for you - highly recommend especially if you have issues but still want a good workout",1470614400,,1388,3.8714285714285714
7383547,5,B0145NSQGW,"I'm relatively new to the videos of Leslie Sansone, but I have done a few several times over the last 5 months.  Today was my first experience with this one, and what a great addition it is.  I started right into the workout without watching/learning the boosted moves first, but that's okay.  Time permitted me to do 3 miles, and I did those miles in about 40 minutes, because this video gets you moving pretty fast.  I got my heart rate up and started to sweat pretty quickly, because that's what Leslie does.  She's pretty efficient that way.

I'm considered obese and I have a back injury,  but I can keep up with the pace pretty well (which seriously is faster than some of her other videos) and I don't feel like passing out afterward, which is always a plus. Next time I will take the time to learn how to do and incorporate the boosted moves.  There was a girl in the background to watch if you want to keep things lower impact.  I'm glad I got this video.  I have always loved Richard Simmons, but I am so glad I found out about Leslie Sansone. My husband says I walk faster and more confidently since I started using her videos.  I've definitely noticed a positive difference, even though the scale hasn't moved down as much as I had hoped.

I enjoy this Walk at Home DVD more than most of the older versions.  The DVD allows you to walk all 5 miles, or choose an individual mile, with out without verbal instructions. Mile 1 includes the warm-up and Mile 5 includes the cool down.
So, if you do miles 2, 3, and 4, you don't have either the warm-up or cool-down to follow.  No big deal as I can do it myself and then follow Leslie and her walkers.

The boosted moves make the workout more challenging, but you can do whatever you feel comfortable with.  Leslie continually encourages walkers to customize the walk to their fitness level.",1466640000,,702,4.5476190476190474

The many walkers and personalities helped pass the time. They all seemed to be having so much fun.

I noticed some people giving less than stellar reviews b/c certain walkers weren't exhibiting what they deem to be acceptable behavior.

The studio looks great, the routine is almost entirely total body exercise (all major muscle groups), I love this group of walkers anf their positive energy, and the music works beautifully with the pace and the moves.  In my 20s and 30s I was into all kinds of sports, trail running, karate, volleyball, kayaking, tennis...there wasn't anything I couldn't keep up with.  Then I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and pernicious anemia, both of which felled my like a tree.  Now I'm pushing 60 and although I can exercise, I need to manage my energy carefully.  This routine works beautifully for me.  I do 2 days on, 1 day off, and on that schedule I'm getting in between 6-7 hours per week of boosted walking.  Six months ago, my doctor was pressuring me to add a second blood pressure medication to my regimen.  Today, my blood pressure has gone from 175/90 to 120/77 and I'm completely off blood pressure medicarion.

She keeps it fresh & fast pace so you get a sweaty workout.  Keeping in her Walk, Walk, Walk style you follow her core moves of side steps, knee lifts, kick backs and kicks...but she also shows you how to boost these core moves.  It was nice to see Nick, and Nadia from her other Walk work outs, and I thoroughly enjoyed Michael & Ellie a married couple who were in the group.  Yes, Michael does his thing while following Leslie, and I read a few past reviews who comment about this (some not too nice).... BUT he moves and walks people !! Leslie always says in her workouts, you DONT have to follow perfectly.... JUST WALK !!  This workout is FUN... I look forward to doing this dvd.  The music is also AWESOME !! It's fast paced with a great beat and I love it !!  I've been working out to Leslie and her walk dvd's for about 2 years now and I've kept off the 40 lbs that I've lost just by walking 6 days a week (5 miles per day) and watching what I eat.

I really enjoyed the workout and thought it was one of her best honestly. I got a great sweat and thought it was fun. I am really losing alot of weight with her workouts.,1457740800,6,455,4.206896551724138
7383601,5,B0145NSQGW,Love the DVD,1457740800,,12,3.3333333333333335
7383602,5,B0145NSQGW,"This DVD is fun! You can do all 5 miles or choose the miles you want to do. It is a good workout & gets your heart going, especially when the weather keeps you indoors.",1457308800,,168,3.8285714285714287
7383603,5,B0145NSQGW,"As always, Leslie's infectious enthusiasm carries the day. I log 30-35 miles per week, and this DVD will make you sweat! An excellent option when the weather's too bad to get outdoors. Highly recommend!",1457136000,,202,4.970588235294118
7383604,5,B0145NSQGW,Love it.,1457136000,,8,3.5
7383605,5,B0145NSQGW,"Not sure if my first review was posted so loved the workout. LS workouts are convenient and easy to do (I boost EVERY workout) and I and stay on beat even when Leslie does not (which is often). I think she talks SO much she loses the beat. The music is fast, fun, and upbeat. The downside to this video is the exercise clown, Michael. He is a distraction and looks ridiculous! It is blatantly obvious he loves the camera! Leave him at home, Leslie, and keep Nick and Marvin! They are humble and seem to care about fitness. Other than that, Leslie scored big on this one!",1457136000,,570,4.287037037037037
7383606,5,B0145NSQGW,"This is a great leslie workout!  I like how you can choose how intense you want your walk to be. Lots of opportunity for ""boosts"" but also a great workout all low impact. One of my favorites!",1457049600,2,191,4.162162162162162
7383607,4,B0145NSQGW,"this is a good tape, but I like her 4 mile tape better.  it is a little hard to do the boost options because of a plate in my ankle.  I will continue to use it and would recommend it.",1456963200,,183,3.55

7383611,5,B0145NSQGW,"I've always loved Leslie's walks. But this is by far the best one ever.  She's added several new moves and new boosted movements as well. There is a section that you can view the boosted moves before starting. There are 5 miles but the miles are set up so that you choose how many miles you want to do, which mile you want, as well as the pace that you want, boosted, regular or somewhere in the middle.  This leaves more options for you according to the amount of time you have and the energy level you want to exert.  This makes it tailor made for you.  You can do miles 2 and 3 one day at the regular pace and then the next time you can do mile 5 at the boosted pace which allows many different options if you get bored with one you can change up so as not to get bored with the same routine. For each boosted movement,one of the walkers stays at that pace to demonstrate how to keep the regular pace versus the boosted pace.  There were all new faces that gave even more variations to some of the moves.  Some were like dance or just more energetic than even the boosted pace. This added variation and all in all led to a great workout.  The only improvement I could suggest is that there is a separate cool down section so that when you choose to do individual miles you don't have to fast forward through mile 5 to get to it.",1456099200,6,1331,4.115830115830116
7383612,5,B0145NSQGW,"I love Leslie Sansone workouts, and this one didn't disappoint.  Its high energy and lots of fun",1456099200,,96,4.647058823529412
7383613,4,B0145NSQGW,"I have many of Leslie's walking DVDs and I love them all.  The workout itself is good, the problem is that Leslie seems a little distracted and almost looks like the proverbial ""deer caught in the headlights"".  The participant I am referring to is Michael and he seems to have a personality that is larger than life. Even though he is probably a really nice person, he seems to require a lot of attention to the point that you're not sure who is conducting the class, him or Leslie.  Because of this, the class feels disorganized and chaotic.  I will still use this DVD because the workout is good enough, but Leslie seems a little lost and confused and because of this it throws off everyone in the class, so it is not one of my favorites.
After doing this workout for about 6 months now I have changed my opinion a bit. I think the workout is great! Leslie does indeed seem a little distracted and it probably is due to Michael's larger than life personality, but that's not his fault. He seems to be having a great time during the workout and actually adds some spark to it. This workout is a good one, has a lot to offer (5 boosted miles) and is a lot of fun.",1456012800,3,1163,4.2727272727272725
7383614,3,B0145NSQGW,Good walking video but Leslie drives me nuts with all her chatter. I'm glad it has a choice to do the walking with her muted.,1455926400,,125,4.04

This one is a joke. It's almost as if they are making fun of her walks. The timing is off, people are just doing their own thing. Leslie isn't even doing the walk , as a result her cueing is off. I noticed all of that from the first 2 miles, I can't review the last 3 miles as the dvd stopped playing at the beginning of the 3rd mile. Very disappointing,  but I love amazon, fast and free returns.",1455580800,7,567,4.008849557522124
7383621,4,B0145NSQGW,"It's a good work out, but I agree with some of the other reviewers about Michael being a distraction. I find myself purposefully not looking at the screen when I know he will be in view, and just listening for the audio cues from Leslie. I like the moves, the use of boosts, and the regular walkers.",1455580800,,299,4.2631578947368425
7383622,5,B0145NSQGW,One of her best ones yet. Some of the other ones I have to end up boosting even when she doesn't to feel like I am doing any cardio. This one keeps a good level of higher cardio.,1455148800,,178,3.710526315789474
7383623,5,B0145NSQGW,"I use the first 3 miles 4 times a week as part of my cardio week. Even though I don't ""boost"" because of a bad knee and an easily injured back, I still get a great workout from this DVD.",1455062400,,186,3.675
7383624,5,B0145NSQGW,Choose your level and get moving! The easiest exercise program I have encountered. A friend told me they use her dvds in cardiac rehab. Not bad!,1454889600,,144,4.576923076923077
7383625,4,B0145NSQGW,"The workout is good.  I liked the new music compared to some of her other DVD's.  (So sick of the song called ""Everybody"" that seems to be in all her DVD's).  I wish that the menu on all of her DVD's could be more individualized to specify ""Warm Up"" and ""Cool Down"" in each DVD.  It is too distracting to try to complete a workout without stretches, etc.  In some of these miles, I felt that the cast was too large and some of the camera angles were distracting.  There is also a lot of bouncing in Mile 4 that I did not care for.  I do like how she designated one person to follow if you need modifications.",1454457600,,608,4.0588235294117645
7383626,5,B0145NSQGW,"This is my favorite leslie dvd. I like that it's 5 miles, fast paced throughout, and there are plenty opportunities to boost when you feel the need or desire. Some reviewers complained about the ""annoying"" guy but to be honest, he wasn't bad and is just having a good time. He doesn't distract me at all. The music in this dvd is good too.",1454371200,5,339,4.3125

7383628,5,B0145NSQGW,"I love this workout DVD, hopefully there will be more 5 mile ones for me to pick up. I have  a lot of her DVD's as I have been with her for years. I've tried a variety of others like Zumba & Tae Bo but always she has been my fav.  I'm a little miffed at some of the other comments regarding Michael. I have no prob with him as I get the impression that he's there to show that you can take your exercise as far out as your imagination will allow or remain as routine or limited as you desire. Line dancing wasn't enough and I hate exercise but I like to walk and I so enjoy Leslie. I've lost 65 pounds of a 75 pound goal. I'm 63 years young. I don't care how many Michaels she's got on there, when I tune in, I'm ready to turn up and my focus is all about me and how Leslie Sansone is helping me to reach my goal. So no complaints Leslie if you read this just thank you so much.",1454198400,9,878,3.7923497267759565
7383629,3,B0145NSQGW,"I cannot believe I am commenting but I feel compelled to.  BIG warning!!!  If you do not like obnoxious, ridiculous people who want to steal the show and totally be distracting do NOT buy this. Michael is a total TURN OFF!  I can barely do this video because of him.  I get nauseous watching him.  Love everything else but him.  What a major disappointment  I hope Leslie does not include him in any further videos.",1454112000,16,415,4.453333333333333
7383630,5,B0145NSQGW,"I have been walking and working out to Leslie's DVDs for 2 years, this DVD is my current favorite, I love it! I have approximately 10 others, so that's saying a lot.  The reason I love this one so much is that if you want it, it gives you a really high heart rate, intense workout that can last as long as an hour and 5 minutes if you do all five miles. As with any of her walks, you can also tone it down as much as you need to.  As Leslie always says, it's not the moves, it's the pace that gets you fit.  When I first started using Leslie's DVDs 2 years ago, an intense workout was not what I was looking for, I just wanted a workout that I didn't hate and was doable for a semi-beginner.  As I have progressed and gotten in better shape, I found that I wanted tougher workouts and this is it.  The first 2 miles have minimal boosting and are a pretty steady medium workout that any beginner can adapt to fit their level.  The last 3 miles speed it up throughout the whole mile and get a good steady burn going.  In my opinion, this DVD would be good for all levels of fitness, except for maybe a person who has never done any kind of aerobic exercise.  If that is where you're at, I would recommend Leslie's Walk Off Fat Fast DVD which has a 20 minute walk called the Easy Burn that any level of fitness could do, plus 2 other workouts that you can build up to.  Also, I would recommend to anyone her Tone Every Zone DVD to add a new level of fitness to your routine.  I lost an additional 10 lbs after adding it last spring to my other Leslie DVDs. I do enjoy Leslie's positive attitude and encouragement,, some may find her too sweet if that's possible.  You can always choose to do the workouts with just music and no instruction.  I really hope she keeps the new DVDs coming, I love them and we need choices!",1453852800,19,1816,4.084507042253521
7383631,5,B0145NSQGW,This is a fun walk and really gets you sweating.  She shows you in a separate segment how to boost moves but if you are a seasoned Leslie walker you already know how.  I was looking for a good 5 mile walk that did not require extra equipment.  This one is fun and has both some of her regular walkers but also introduces some new walkers.  The DVD can be played all at once or you can select individual miles from the menu. Warm up is in mile one and cool down in mile 5. I wish they were listed separate from the miles so if you just wanted to do a few miles you could get to them easily.  Not enough of a concern for me to count it against the rating.,1453680000,,653,3.8796992481203008

They reminded me to have fun while I workout- especially Michael! I loved his positivity!  For those that complain about her chatting- mute your TV and work out to your own music. The only downside is that Leslie never features any truly overweight walkers. She should consider heavier folks to remind us that her moves are approachable by ALL people!,1453507200,5,521,4.725274725274725

7383640,3,B0145NSQGW,"I wish I liked this workout more because I do love Leslie. I like the different boosts she adds into each mile, some I hadn't seen before. The miles seems to go by quickly, too. I have a couple of issues with this one though. First is that the warm-up and cool down are not marked as separate chapters, so if you want to try to customize your walk for the day, you'll have to start with Mile 1 for the warm-up and then fast forward through Mile 5 to get to the cool down. Also, I can't tell if the warm-up and cool down count as part of Mile 1 and 5, so if for some reason, a person wants to do Mile 5 but not the cool down, is stopping before the cool down still a full mile? I'm sure I can use my step tracker to estimate, but I shouldn't have to for a workout that is designed to be completed by the mile.

My other issue is one that others have mentioned about the walkers in this video. I am not one to try to dull anyone's sparkle, but there were times when I found Michael's movements to be a bit over the top to the point of distraction. Some of his movements were not even done in proper form, especially during the cool down. I am all for people putting a little ""something something"" into the movements to make it more fun for yourself, but it shouldn't detract from the leader whose giving instructions.",1453420800,5,1315,4.077220077220077

7383647,3,B0145NSQGW,"This DVD has 5 solid miles of high energy walking, but doesn't really have any new moves.  Leslie does a series of her standard walk moves (walking, side steps, knee lifts and kicks) during each mile and shows a way to ""boost"" each move.  She works out with a group of walkers for each mile, accompanied by fast paced techno music.  I didn't think there was enough variety from Leslie's other DVDs to make this one very interesting.  Also, you can choose to do all 5 miles or pick one mile at a time, but there is only a warm up in Mile 1 and only a cool down at the end of mile 5, so you have to search for that if you aren't doing mile 5 as part of your workout.",1452643200,10,664,3.969924812030075
7383648,4,B0145NSQGW,"I Received this video last week and did all five miles And I really enjoyed them. I felt like it was a strong DVD but not as strong as some of her other five mile DVDs. The addition of Michael on miles 2, 3, 4 and 5 sorry to say, was that it was very distracting to me and rather annoying.  Since  the camera was on him pretty much it was very hard To keep focused on my own moves. I enjoyed the music But enjoy Leslie's other DVD's that have more hit music. Hopefully Leslie will reconsider the addition of men on any new dvds and keep it to Nick and  Marvin.",1452643200,2,560,3.938053097345133
7383649,5,B0145NSQGW,"I love, love, love it!  This video is so much fun it's not even like exercising.  Leslie is just the BEST walking instructor ever!",1452643200,2,130,4.375
7383650,5,B0145NSQGW,"I have been using Leslie's tapes/DVDs off and on for several years.  I couldn't have made it through my pregnancy 11 years ago without her 3 mile walk tape.  More recently, I purchased the Ultimate Collection, which had 1, 2, 3 and 4 Mile walks on it.  I only did the 4 mile walk about once a week as a way to add a little variety to my workout routine.  I'd still be using that DVD, but it quit playing for some reason.  I decided to purchase 5 Boosted Miles and I'm glad I did!

First, the boosts aren't difficult.  After watching the instructional segment on how to do the boosted moves, I realized that I had already been 'boosting' my moves as I walked along on the 4 mile walk.  There are some additional boosted moves that add nice variety to 5 miles of walking.

When I put the DVD in for the first time, my intention was to do a 4 mile walk, as I had limited time and I was used to the 4 mile distance.  I have to say, the DVD was so fun, I walked the whole 5 miles!  I have done the 5 mile workout now about 5 times and have to say that these workouts have improved immensely over the years.

A few things I really liked about the new format...

**There is a costume change and very short break for between each mile.

**The companion walkers are a variety of shapes and sizes, although all are relatively young.  There were no over 50 folks like me that I could identify, but they were a fun group and I felt like they would accept a 50-something in the class (especially one watching from home!).

**Leslie actually broke formation several times, stopped walking and circled the other walkers while giving encouragement.  There were lots of different angles covered by the cameraman and plenty of motion shots too.

All of these elements above are important because watching someone walk for an hour or more on a tape/DVD gets old fast!  I am quite happy with the changes in format and don't see myself getting bored with this anytime soon.",1452556800,,1952,4.313186813186813
7383651,5,B0145NSQGW,I'm a big fan of Leslie's.  I like how she gives both the high and low impact versions.  I'm over 60 and can't do all the jumping moves but can still be a part of  a great and fun workout.  Love the music!,1452556800,,205,3.697674418604651
7383652,2,B0145NSQGW,"I like the graduated miles and the boosted moves.  But Leslie Sansone has gotten too lax with the workout overall.  There is too much interaction with the walkers and way too much talking from one individual in particular.  It's good to encourage people to have fun, but there is a limit between fun and chaos, and unfortunately, this video is chaotic after the first mile.  Not to mention, Leslie Sansone seems to lose credibility, at least with me, when she doesn't have control over the group and the workout.  I would like to love this workout, but because of that, I have to give it a big thumbs down!  Too bad!  What a waste because the longer workouts are really what I am looking for.",1452556800,2,692,4.488
7383653,5,B0145NSQGW,Another good dvd by Leslie.  I like that this one is a little more upbeat.  There are 5 different 15 minute sessions which makes it easy to do a long or short workout depending on the time you have.,1452211200,,198,4.051282051282051

7383656,4,B0145NSQGW,"This is a fun dvd.  To be honest, though - the bonus section of boosting the top 10 moves was a bit disappointing.  If you are a seasoned Leslie Sansone walker, chances are you are already boosting moves on your own.  But, for people just starting out with her workouts, maybe it would be helpful.  But, aside from that, this is a good workout. And, even if you are a seasoned walker - this is a great dvd to add to a collection for more of a variety in your walking workouts.  Like most of hers, you can choose different miles and mix up your workout.  This is a fun, fast paced workout that is never boring.  I boost most everything and work up a good sweat doing them.",1452124800,2,671,4.155038759689923
7383657,5,B0145NSQGW,"I have many many of Leslie's DVDs.  This is my newest purchase and I really enjoy it.

It has a choice of 5 different walks!  Each one a mile.  The first mile and the fifth mile include a warm up and cooldown respectively.

The cast is great, as they are in most of her walks.  After you do these for a while you really do feel like you are in a 'class' with these folks.

I enjoy the fact that you can also play with just the music.  I sometimes do the miles I want and then go to mile 1 and do just the music for my cooldown period.",1452038400,4,534,3.790909090909091
7383658,3,B0145NSQGW,"I really enjoy the energy of the walkers on this DVD but it has the same video quality issue as
Leslie Sansone: Walking Off the Pounds, which I reviewed a day or so ago.  When the camera zooms out to the entire group, all the faces look like they are in a carnival house mirror.  It really makes it hard to watch.  I wonder if that is why the price was so low on this DVD.  I am disappointed that Leslie's video production company released such a poor quality video.",1451606400,2,466,4.144444444444445
7383659,4,B0145NSQGW,"This is another gem from Leslie.  I am an avid collector and have been for 20 years.  I must admit that I smiled when Leslie had us doing the side leg swings in this dvd, as that move goes way back!  I loved the variety of movements, and the options to boost for an increase in fitness level and calorie burn.  The costume changes were lovely, as was the hair and makeup, particularly Leslie's.  She looks incredible on this dvd.  The music is very enjoyable on this one...it really kept me motivated and moving, and the miles went by quickly.  I knocked off one star due to the antics of one cast member in particular.  I am hoping that this will not become a part of future workouts, as it quickly became distracting, and irritating to me.  As a mother of three young children, I truly value my ME time spent on fitness, and I guess I take it more seriously.  Anyway, this dvd will still make it into my regular rotation, particularly when I have time for a longer workout.",1451520000,,975,4.337016574585635

7383661,4,B0145NSQGW,"I would love to give this video five stars but there are a few things that made me take away one star. The first is the choreography: it is off with some of the moves in that if you are using the song to follow along then the beat stops, and the rest of the routine falls flat. The second is one of the male walkers seemed to be ADHD, in that he drums to his own tune until re-directed by Leslie, and she had to do that more than once. I have to praise Leslie for making the situation work and her patience. Lastly, After 5 or 6 tapes of Leslie's program, I was hoping she curbed the chatting somewhat, but that has not happened. However, her DVDs are working for me and I am happy about that.",1451433600,3,693,3.9928057553956835
7383662,5,B0145NSQGW,My favorite Leslie Sansone.  (Love Michael!),1451433600,7,44,6.333333333333333
7383663,5,B0145NSQGW,"Another great Leslie DVD.  It has some of my favorite elements.  I like the mile by mile structure, so I can play one mile, or combine them.  I appreciate the high energy of the walkers, the fact that Leslie has someone show a modified lower impact version, the ability to play it with or without the instruction/verbal track, and the music... I think this is some of the best music on her DVDs if, like me, you enjoy electronica and dance techno style. But my favorite element is likely the color changes in the outfits.  I like that each mile, the costumes change to follow a shared color scheme - I love details like that and I LOVE color and design... (Even the lighting on the Walk At Home sign changes every mile!) My favorite Leslie DVDs tend to be the ones with color embellishments, like the HIIT Dance Party walks and the color miles on the Ultimate 5 day Walk Plan. The moves are traditional Leslie, so nothing much new here, except the use of short high energy boosts of various types - but I find that if you've done one Leslie workout, you have a pretty good idea of the types of moves you will need to be able to accomplish.  She does keep switching things up, so I never get bored, but everything is pretty easy to master. On the downside, the warmup and cool down are both inserted into the first and last miles respectively, so if you just choose something like mile 3, there is not warm up or cool down.  I prefer when the warm up and the cool down are separate so I can use them with any combination of miles.  Also, Leslie seems to do more chatting in this one, moving around and talking to everyone while in the middle of the workout rather than leading the steps.  That's okay with me on some level as I always enjoy getting to know the other walkers a bit - it is amazing how much personality can come through just by watching someone walk! - but it seems a bit heavy handed this time.  Michael was the other distraction. He is a new backup walker, and seems a bit of a class clown, wanting to be the focus of attention.  It is obvious he and his wife are a high energy couple and were having a great time.  I admire their sense of fun and energy, but I also found his antics a bit wearisome after a while.  Still, I will probably just learn to ignore them more as I watch the workout more often.  Maybe this different approach is a marketing strategy, trying to appeal to a younger audience or something.  I certainly have noticed a that Leslie's videos have changed through out the years, become more colorful and playful, with a better musical soundtrack (in my opinion)  and with younger walkers - so maybe this is more of the same.",1451347200,4,2660,4.313253012048193

7383665,5,B0145NSQGW,"Leslie has done it again! I've been an avid Leslie Walks exerciser since discovering her in 2008. Since then I've regularly added new DVDs to my daily workout regimen, which I alternate to accommodate my schedule on any given day. With this latest effort, Leslie engages seasoned and beginner walkers with fun, new moves and a ""boosted"" variation of each. As with all of her workouts, individuals can customize to their fitness level and preference but I love that this new one poses a greater endurance challenge while still remaining achievable. After accomplishing all five miles, I felt energized and alive -- partly from the moves themselves and partly because of her upbeat team of walkers who keep it interesting. As always, Leslie is sweet, genuine, and motivating. I highly recommend 5 Boosted Miles!",1451001600,,809,5.044776119402985

7383669,4,B0145NSQGW,"the only reason i gave this video 4 stars is because i truly worked up a sweat in just a couple of miles.  and i was really looking forward to it.

what i don't like: leslie does not always give enough time to set up for moves or make it clear to the viewer and background walkers that the move is over.  the background walkers have some irritating moves and do not always do the move when clearly directed. 2 of the background walkers have NO business being in a workout video.  and the stylist should be fired.  most of the workout gear is hideous and looks like its already out of date.  normally, it wouldn't bother me too much but nicks shorts are very distracting where the neon is hitting his knee or between his legs.  leslie looks like she is being choked in one top.

i will keep this in my rotation for a good sweaty workout, but i'm going to have to try to avoid looking at anyone but leslie.",1449964800,,904,4.184971098265896
7383670,3,B0145NSQGW,"Leslie may love Michael, but he drove me insane!  I just finished all 5 miles, and I plan to go back to Mile 1 where it's just Nick and some girls & NOT Michael.  I understand people individualizing the walks, but Michael was so distracting and always doing his own thing, it felt like he should have his own dance show.  I thought the purpose of the walkers was to help us see how the moves are done.  I felt like he wanted all the attention for himself.  I will definitely be checking future video casts to see who's in them, and if Michael is, I won't be buying!!  (I own at least 1 dozen Leslie videos.  I love her & her positive motivation.  I also LOVED her yellow shirt in this one!  And I love Nick!  He follows along & is pleasant to look at!)",1449705600,20,752,4.089041095890411
7383671,5,B0145NSQGW,"Love this workout video. My only wish is that the boosted part lasted a little longer. Doesn't quite get my heart rate going enough with the short boosts, although I do enjoy them. There is one guy that appears in miles 2-5 that scared me the first time I watched. Mile 2 starts and he is laughing and it's almost creepy sounding. I love his energy but he just scares you at first. This video doesn't have a time ticker, which I love. The time ticker makes me focus to much on ""okay, only 10 more minutes...8 more minutes...7 minutes 45 seconds left..."" I'd rather not know and be surprised when 15 minutes have ticked by and it doesn't feel like it. Leslie is her usual positive self with a fun crew and some new moves that offer a fresh take on all her original steps.",1449532800,3,770,4.280821917808219

7383674,4,B0145NSQGW,"Like this, but wish she would not chat so much.  Just lead the exercise.  I would like the DVD to give me the option of picking 3 miles without doing each one separate then going back to the menu to select the next one.",1449100800,,219,3.9545454545454546
7383675,4,B0145NSQGW,"This is a solid workout.  I enjoyed it through and through and thought it incorporated the boosted moves very well.  Of course, you can add more which I did in some cases, but it was a good consistent pace for all 5 mile with sprinkles of new moves.  I was concerned about Michael, but I got past it.  He did add his own flair for sure, and while I think he should have toned it down some for the sake of the workout presentation, it's not enough to deter me from this.  However, Leslie needs to be cautious of this in the future because it really may turn off customers as some have already noted.  It just comes a point where cute and funny isn't after a while.  She had moments of chattiness but not too bad.  My biggest complaint in the camera roving around at times. I actually got motion sick and dizzy a few times where I got caught off guard by the MTV like shots. So I had to look at the wall or elsewhere during those times so I could continue.  I want to say I thought the music tracks were really good.  Mostly techno/party music but different than others of hers and blended well.",1449014400,15,1093,4.186602870813397

7383677,4,B0145NSQGW,"I prefer 5 mile workouts to help mix things up and keep me challenged.  This is not a bad workout but I have to agree with the other reviewer, the guy (I think his name is Michael) - he was sort of annoying during the workout.  In her other videos, there is ad libbing here and there - some funny faces here and there (Marvin and Nick are good at this) but this guy in the video - he was trying too hard to be funny - trying too hard to make the moves his moves and they didn't translate well- at least for me.  Whats clear is that he and his wife (who is in the video) appear very free spirited.  When I walk, I like to remain fairly in sync with the walkers.  WIth this guy, its a bit distracting - a bit painful to watch.  I admit, I walked in front of the mirror and just listened to Leslie's voice without watching the video after going through the entire workout one time.  I can concentrate better watching myself than the workout.  This will stay in rotation because of the 5 mile option - its not a bad workout.",1448928000,5,1020,4.039800995024875

Someone commented about the one gentleman stealing the show and I agree, he was distracting.  The only set back is that there is no menu customization such as selecting a warm-up, cool down, and any mile you would prefer to do if not interested in completing all 5 miles at one time.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this workout.",1448668800,,429,4.532467532467533

7383685,5,B0145NSQGW,"I just did this one yesterday. All the way through. Well, I stopped between the 2nd and 3rd mile for a while. I won't go into too many specifics, except to say it's perfect for folks in their mid 50s, etc. Fun as usual. There's some girl's husband in it that steals the show so to speak. Maybe a tad much, but I like his ad libbing. Exercise shouldn't be boring. Lots of cool outfit changes.(I couldn't believe I was the only one that notices and/or appreciates these things) Shallow, but I don't care. Eye candy. (The gorgeous Nick is in all 5 miles!) woo hoo ;) !!  Leslie is cute as heck and it's a sweaty, quick workout. Loved it!!! No weights or accessories used. And you get the choice not to boost. Luckily, the 'boosting' in this one is very low impact. Some bouncing around I had to do low impact, but for the most part not too hard on the old joints. I must admit that I miss the old timers. Mary Kay, Linda, Jo., etc. Sorry to be so wordy, but I'm passionate specifically about Leslie. You can tell, she's so real and sweet. I've been doing her videos since 2009.  But I finally got real about my diet and have lost 33 lbs since 1/12/15 doing her MANY videos I own. Yay!

That is more calories than I have burned doing previous 5 mile walks with Leslie.  The menu doesn't let you mix and match individual miles, either the full workout or any one mile.

I've been very depressed and pretty inactive because it was so little I could do anymore. Leslie's workout allows me to get some aerobic activity without hurting my knees because I can still walk I just can't run or do anything high impact or lunges another weight lifting moves. But I can do almost everything in this DVD and the crew that works with Leslie is inspirational and just plain fun to work out with. If you're new to distance work, you can just do the 1-mile segment 2 start for a while and then slowly build each mile on overtime. I had a 3 Mi DVD that I was using and when I got bored with that I went to this 5 Mile boosted DVD.
