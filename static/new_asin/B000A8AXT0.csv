8076231,3,B000A8AXT0,"There are two types of people- those that like the East Side/Dead End/Bowery Boys movies and those that don't.
If you fall into the former, then the question becomes - how bad is the print? These are not bad prints, not great, but until somebody ponies up the money to do a professional remaster, it is the best we can get.
If you are a fan, enjoy- if not- save your money",1362355200,,372,4.180555555555555
8076232,1,B000A8AXT0,"There are 8 movies on 2 discs. That alone would make for not so good a picture. The first movie 'Spooks Run Wild' had a very bad picture,very dark; but I was able to follow the story line. After that,the second movie'Ghosts On The Loose' was just unwatchable. I don't know whether to call the picture frozen or jumpy but it was like that all the way thru. The audio was so broken up it couldn't be understood. The 3rd movie started the same way so I just turned it off. The 1st two movies are the only ones I really wanted and I have them ordered separately;also from Amazon. I really hope they will be watchable. I guess I'll have to throw the 1st 2 discs in the trash.",1284854400,3,670,4.161538461538462
8076233,5,B000A8AXT0,"This is a great collection of 10 East Side Kids movies. I had previously purchased all of these films from Alpha Video. But we all know how the Alpha experience can sometimes be. A severely washed out and cut-up movie missing your favorite scenes. This set from the Diamond Entertainment group is a lot better. I'm still waiting however for TCM to give us the definitive digitally re-mastered collection featuring all the movies. These are the East Side Kids,the group that evolved from the Dead End Kids and eventually became the Bowery Boys. The Eastsiders were my favorite incarnation of the gang. This set features the two flicks that the Kids made with Bela Lugosi(Spooks Run Wild and Ghosts On The Loose)and two of my favorites from the series,Bowery Blitzkrieg and Neath Brooklyn Bridge. It's good fun and a wonderful,nostalgic trip into the past.",1267488000,20,854,4.9375
8076234,2,B000A8AXT0,I think it was worth the 8 dollars.  Only two movies worked.  Both duds.  Boo hoo!,1259798400,13,82,4.0
8076235,1,B000A8AXT0,"The condition of these 2 dics set is very bad quality,some plays then stops and some won't even
play at all. It is a very bad investment to buy this set of The East Side Kids,even though it is just
around eight dollars,8 shows for a dollar each and you caint even enjoy watching them. Not recommended !!!!!!!!",1251072000,15,309,4.344827586206897
