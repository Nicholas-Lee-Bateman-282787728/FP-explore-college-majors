8183132,4,B000O6D6D8,"This is the second copy of this (relatively obscure) German film that I've purchased - the first version was a print of the flik, with a dubbed English sound track, sold as part of 'The David Hamilton Collection'.  The transfer quality of this DVD was very poor - apparently duped from a VHS source - it was grainy & degenerated to the point that it detracted appreciably from the viewing experience - which was annoying because the film offered a lot of great looking women & nudity that just couldn't really be seen clearly - frustrating!!

When I saw this German DVD become available I took a chance that it would offer a more 'original / better quality' image (in the past I've found many German DVDs to have great image quality !) and plunked down the rather hefty purchase price to check it out - even knowing that this version had NO English vocals or subtitles.  I'm happy to report that the Euro product provided a marked visual improvement and greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the movie.  It should be noted that this is a Euro - Region 2 PAL format DVD and requires a region-free player for N. American viewing.

Fortunately I had the (previously purchased) English language version to guide me thru the rather complex plot-line that is involved with a lot of internal familial scheming and intrigue - plus a little bit of 'white slavery' action  on the side.  I was originally drawn to this flik by the presence of hot 80's German actress Olivia Pascal who was very impressively mostly naked in her premiere film effort 'Vanessa"" - hoping to see more of her physical charms on display. ""Island of 1000 Delights""  DID provide a nice sampliing of Ms Pascal sans clothing (as well as a couple of other blonde lovlies!) and I'd have to say that, from my perspective, it IS primarily the liberal doses of naked female flesh that make this film worth checking out.  There are numerous (simulated / soft core) sex scenes scattered throughout and Olivia even has a nice (albeit brief) 'topless torture' episode as her character is interrogated by the 'bad guys'... for those that enjoy such.

All in all - I was happy with this (second) version of the film and would recommend it, principally, for its' attractive cast, and their willingness to shed their clothes -with or without English it's worth a look.",1374105600,,2311,4.669950738916256
