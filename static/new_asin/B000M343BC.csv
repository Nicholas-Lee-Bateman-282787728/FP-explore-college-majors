2722866,3,B000M343BC,"""Flushed Away"" is a film I'm torn over. On the one hand, it's perfect for children, filled with humorous circumstances, borderline slapstick action sequences, and colorful characters. On the other hand, it's unflatteringly unoriginal, despite the unique settings and vibrant plot. It didn't help that I had already seen most of the funnier moments in the trailers and TV commercials, all of which were repeatedly played. They felt hollow by the time I actually saw the film, with all my initial amusement completely run dry. I'm beginning to think that too many animated films were released in 2006. But such a thought is wasted effort; more will be released before the year is over, and I know I'm going to see at least one or two of them. Call me crazy, but even though I'm an adult, I still have a soft spot for family oriented animated films.

And that's why criticizing this film will be difficult. I recognize that it has its good points, and it comes across in the plot; it tells the story of a pampered pet rat named Roddy (Hugh Jackman). While he lives the good life in an upper class British neighborhood called Kensington, he's incredibly lonely, having only his young owner's dolls to serve as friends. He even says ""Goodnight"" to himself when he goes to bed. But such a humdrum life is about to change; one night, a rat pops out of the kitchen sink. Here enters Sid (Shane Richie), a loud, obnoxious sewer rat who decides that he wants the kind of life Roddy has. In desperation, Roddy attempts to flush his unwanted guest down the toilet. Unfortunately, it backfires; Roddy is the one who lands in the bowl, and Sid is quick to pull the flushing mechanism.

Thus begins Roddy's adventure in the sewers of London, one that will force him to reassess his life on the surface. In this underworld, he discovers an entire population of rats, all of which live in an elaborately modeled miniature city. He also discovers other life forms, specifically frogs and slugs. I admit that such an idea was promising, and to some degree, it succeeded. Consider the interesting characters he runs into; the most important is Rita (Kate Winslet), an on-the-run, tough-as-nails rat who pilots a makeshift watercraft. Apparently, a ruthless amphibian crime boss known only as The Frog (Ian McKellen) wants a ruby that's in her possession (why he wants it is never adequately explained), and he's prepared to go to great lengths to get it.

But matters are complicated when Roddy enters the picture. Initially, his only goal is to get back home; never mind Rita, the ruby, The Frog, or The Frog's dimwitted henchman, Whitey (Bill Nighy) and Spike (Andy Serkis). But through a series of ill-timed and accidental events (such as revealing Rita's location and destroying a number of The Frog's best loved souvenirs), Roddy gets himself involved. He now has to work with Rita if he wishes to return home, no easy task considering Rita's distrusting nature. The fact that she steals a computer power cord from The Frog's lair makes the situation even worse; The Frog needs that cord in order to carry out a dastardly plan during the World Series, one that directly relates to his hatred of rodents.

It seems as if I'm describing a completely engaging film. But the reality is that something was missing. Let's start with the underground city: it's impressive to say the least. In retrospect, it's a little too impressive; the local rats have built a near-perfect replica of London, complete with a working London Bridge and a menacing yet attractive Big Ben. Access to electricity doesn't seem to be a problem, and this is proven through shots of the city's miniature neon light displays. If such a fantastic world has been created, one would expect it to be central to the story, relevant enough to warrant serious exploration. This didn't happen in ""Flushed Away""; the best we're given are some brief exterior shots, all of which do little to make the rest of the story meaningful. Example: have the rats created little supermarkets in this city, and if so, do they shop in them? Such a slice of life would have given this film a much-needed dose of credibility.

Rita's circumstances were also problematic; it's eventually revealed that she has a large family living in poverty (in the sewer world, that translates to a floating pile of boxes that continuously rocks back and forth). Her intention in stealing the ruby was selfless rather than selfish; her family needs money desperately. This goes double for her father, whose entire body is wrapped in a cast (much like before, no adequate explanation is given for this). Yes, Rita's plight is touching, but it still didn't make enough of an impact. Her family is given such little screen time that its general inclusion in the story seemed unnecessary (save for a few amusing one liners). Maybe it would have been better if Rita had stolen the ruby for selfish reasons; it may lack any morality, but at least the story would be more focused.

And then there are the side characters, most of which are provided for comedy relief. A legion of slugs is first and foremost in this film. At times they act like frightened children, screaming in weak, squeaky voices at anything unfamiliar (specifically Roddy). At other times, they serve the story as a kind of Greek Chorus, appearing at inconvenient moments to express the characters' feelings through song (most of which are recent pop hits; ""Rolling on the River"" and ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" come to mind). The idea initially worked. But after a while, their continuous presence became repetitive and stale. Then there's Le Frog (Jean Reno), The Frog's perpetually sticky, ninja-fighting French cousin. He's nothing more than a caricature, hollowly portraying a nationality in exaggerated, almost offensive ways. ""I laugh at everyone's pain but my own,"" he says: ""I'm French!""

I realize that I may be analyzing ""Flushed Away"" a little too deeply. The fact that it forced an analysis in the first place is troublesome. Am I not supposed to escape into this fantasy world? Wasn't I supposed to lose myself in imagination and fun? I wish I could say that this film had that kind of effect on me, and I wish that it had enough good points to outweigh its flaws. Sadly, this isn't the case; I can only consider ""Flushed Away"" as a decent attempt that ultimately misses the mark. If saying this upsets those of you with children, especially those who are dying to see this movie, then feel free to flush my review down the toilet.",1162857600,4,6520,4.795373665480427
2722867,4,B000M343BC,"Roddy (Hugh Jackman), a pet rat living in a posh house in Kensington, London, wakes up one morning to find the little girl who cares for him has gone on vacation, leaving him enough food for a month. With the house to himself, he makes a checklist of fun activities and uses the girl's other toys as companions. Later, that same evening, Roddy awakes to a strange noise and arrives in the kitchen just in time to see Sid (Shane Richie), a fat sewer rat, explode through the kitchen plumbing. When Sid realizes where he is, he quickly makes himself comfortable. Roddy is aghast at the messy intruder and comes up with a way to get rid of him. Offering his guest a Jacuzzi bath, he shows him the toilet. Sid is all for the Jacuzzi, but turns the tables on Roddy who is soon flushed away. In the sewers, the pet rat finds a miniature London populated by sewer rats, frogs and slugs. He soon meets Rita (Kate Winslet), the tough as nails skipper of a little schooner. She is wanted by the Toad (Sir Ian McKellan), the local gangster with  a brood of rat henchmen, including Whitey (Bill Nighy), a former laboratory rat who is now an albino and Spike (Andy Serkis, the Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings""), Whitey's none too bright accomplice. The Toad has a master plan and wants the ruby Rita stole from him. When they retrieve that, Rita quickly grabs the ""Master Cable"", the Toad's method of controlling the flood gate into their world. Rita and Roddy form an uneasy alliance to escape and set things right.

""Flushed Away"" is a CGI Animated film from the same people who brought us the ""Wallace and Gromit"" films and ""Shrek"". If you are familiar with Wallace and Gromit, you probably know they are animated using an old fashioned technique; Claymation. The figures are made out of clay and they are moved and changed for every single frame, giving them a rounded look and making them appear three dimensional. You also frequently see thumbprints and imperfections as the characters move and change, but this is part of the charm for this type of animation.

In ""Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were-rabbit"", the filmmakers developed a new software program allowing them to animate the bunnies floating around in the Bun-Vac 6000, while retaining the same look of Claymation. This software was used to make all of ""Flushed Away"". Essentially, the entire film is created with CGI, but the software maintains certain imperfections and shows us an occasional thumbprint. It is an interesting idea and works well. Perhaps too well. I'm sure this new software allows for a faster production schedule, but it also allows the filmmakers to create larger, more complicated landscapes. This robs this type of animation of intimacy. In ""Curse of the Were-rabbit"", it was more than a little endearing to see Wallace and Gromit's little British village come to life. In ""Flushed Away"", Roddy enters a miniature London, complete with replicas of the London Bridge, Big Ben, Piccadilly, neon, ads, shops and more. It is just too large and makes the characters seem lost and more traditionally animated. This scene is reminiscent of the same company's ""Shark Tales""; we watch Will Smith's character swim into an underwater version of Times Square.

Honestly, when I saw the trailers for ""Flushed"" I thought Roddy was voiced by Ralph Fiennes. After his appearance in ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"", it fit. So I was shocked to learn the voice was Hugh Jackman. He does a good job of playing a rich, upper-class rat, used to a life of privilege in the Royal Borough of Kensington. Kate Winslet does a good job as Rita, the skipper of her own boat, with a large family to look after, providing for her disabled dad (David Suchet) and mum (Kathy Burke) and their ever increasing brood. But their performances are just a little too ordinary. They don't add another dimension to these characters.

The real voice talent lies in the supporting cast of characters. Sir Ian McKellan seems to have a great time playing a larger than life Toad bent of controlling his little universe. He has some funny moments throughout the film; for instance when he shows off his prized collection of ceramic representations of the Royal Family, he smiles broadly like a child showing his report card, eager for a nod of approval. He is all bombast and ego as he tries to continue with his evil plan, making him a funny take off of many of the James Bond villains.

Jean Reno is also amusing as Le Frog, the leader of a band of French frogs who wear leather jackets and do the bidding of their cousin, the Toad. At one point, he yells for his followers to respond and they shout ""We surrender."" Later, he is perturbed to have his coffee interrupted and throws a coin on his Parisian caf table before hopping off.

Bill Nighy is also very good as Whitey, the brain damaged henchman of the Toad. He states ""I used to be a laboratory rat. Dealt with a lot of shampoo and now I'm white."" Throughout, he adds a certain goofy charm to the role.

The film contains a couple of ongoing funny jokes. When Roddy first arrives in the sewers, he encounters a large group of slugs, who are as terrified of the rat as the rat is of them. They scream a high pitched squeal and attempt to run away, but their progress is slow. Throughout the film, they return and provide a sort of Greek chorus, singing songs from the 50s and 60s, fitting for that particular moment in the film.

Perhaps the funniest ongoing joke is the Mime Frog. The band of French motorcycle gang frogs have a mime who accompanies them everywhere. When they first appear, they stop for a moment, so he can do a little routine. Later, when they are confronting Rita and Roddy, Le Frog brings out a cell phone with a camera and the Mime places it in front of his face. While the Toad speaks to them from afar, the Mime acts out the Toad's gestures, pace, inflections and more. A couple of times the Toad gets exasperated with the Mime, yelling at him to do something. It is an original and funny sequence.

The character transformations for Roddy and Rita happen way too fast. One moment, they are fighting each other, pairing up simply because they have to. Then they are suddenly longing for each other's company and they want to spend the rest of their lives together. This is not a subtle change and brings to mind the type of character development one would find in an animated series on television. Why couldn't they find a few more moments, another story development to make this more believable? The problem is the kids won't even notice this type of thing. It is the adult chauffeur's who will and keeps the film from joining the hallowed ranks of animated classics.

During the screening, I noticed one father snoring loudly throughout the entire film. Clearly, his interest was not held. And I can't believe he was the only one.

""Flushed Away"" is cute, bright, and full of energy but has story problems and the larger canvas robs the animation of any intimacy. Why try to recreate the look of Claymation in CGI if you are going to try to make the landscape huge? Claymation begs for intimacy. ""Flushed Away"" is a film sure to keep the kids happy and adults will have a few laughs. It is a good animated effort, not as good as some I have seen this year (""Cars"", ""Monster House"", Open Season"", ""Over the Hedge"") and far better than others (""Ant Bully"").

 I highly recommend this movie if you love ""Chicken Run"", and ""Wallace & Gromit"". If you have not seen any of Aardmans other shows/movies you will miss a few sight gags, but that is certionly no reason not to see this! So in the end; This movie is a must see and definitely fun for the whole family.",1162598400,32,497,4.333333333333333
2722870,5,B000M343BC,"Roddy's sheltered life of as pet rat is ruined when: he's flushed down the toilet.
 In the bowls of London, Ruddy matches both fists and whits with sewer pirates, French mercenaries, and even the mafia God-frog.  All in the desperate attempt to escape to the surface whatever means possible.
 This is non-stop laughs with half evolved primordial creatures, high speed sewer chases, and French frogs.
The story spends very little time on character development and plot; this can be considered both good or bad.  This is not drama in an animation not even of the level of Monsters Inc, but this is so much funny.  Character development and plot are glazed over to give place to jokes.
These are jokes so thick they interrupt jokes for jokes.  This is the ""Laugh Candy,"" and it's about as sweet as it gets.",1162512000,5,803,4.7
2722871,5,B000M343BC,"I have to be honest.  This probably deserves four stars instead of five, but despite a sometimes-rushed narrative there were so many delightful moments in this film that I couldn't with a light heart give it less.  In the never-ending search for new subjects to animate, no one had before attempted to tell a story about sewer rats.  Fortunately, the rats in FLUSHED AWAY are remarkably humanoid, largely covered with light-colored skin, and sporting not terribly disgusting tails.  So while this is a story of rats, they are rats with all of the unpleasantries associated with the vermin stripped away.

The film was made by Aardman Productions, the company founded on the success of Nick Park's amazing Claymation projects, most famously the Wallace and Gromit films as well as CHICKEN RUN.  This film is all CGI, I suspect because most of the scenes are set in the sewer, which is surrounded by water.  I'm not sure that it would be possible to do a Claymation project that involves copious amounts of water.  Although the film is CGI, all the characters sport the look that we all associate with Nick Park projects.  Interestingly, Park does not appear in the credits, although the aesthetic he created permeates the film.

The story tells the ordeals suffered by Roddy, a pet rat owned by a little girl in Kensington in London.  When the family is on vacation and the house is invaded by a street punk rat (voiced by Shane Ritchie of THE EASTENDERS), the elegant rat finds himself flushed down the toilet to the sewer, where he discovers an entire community of rats.  Wanting to return home, he is directed to a boat owned by a female rat named Rita.  The rest of the film deals both with Rita's attempt to help Roddy get home as well as their struggles to evade the minions of a toad sewer lord.  The plot is adequate to the task, but what is delightful about the film is the wonderfully fresh and inventive humor.  There are also a number of animals used to great effect that have amazingly been neglected by the legions of earlier animal animators, in particular snails, which are used for comic relief and for -- I am not kidding -- musical background.  There is also a wonderful gang of frogs that are, of course, French.  Led by their chief Le Frog, they are masters of the martial arts and have their very own mime, who provides some of the film's finest comic moments.

One reason the film succeeds so wonderfully is the first cast voiceover talent.  Hugh Jackman gets to put some of his talents to use that were never needed in the X-Men films, even getting to show off his outstanding singing voice on a couple of numbers.  Kate Winlet is appropriately fetching as Rita and Ian McKellan is marvelously over-the-top as Toad.  Andy Serkis and Bill Nighy voice Toad's two main henchmen.  One of the great delights of the movie is Le Frog, voiced by Jean Reno.

I think this is a film that can be equally enjoyed by parents and their kids.  The preview audience that I saw this with contained probably more adults than it will enjoy upon general release, but the few kids in the audience laughed very hard throughout.  So did the adults.  There are a number of animated films coming out in the next couple of months for the holidays, but I have a sneaking suspicion that this one might end up being the best -- and certainly the funniest -- of the bunch.",1162166400,17,3365,4.585284280936455

2723021,5,B000M343BC,"This is a hilarious film, with several plots and sub-plots, including the pet rat of a wealthy family's child, who gets flushed down the toilet by a sewer rat intruder, and wants to go home and rid it of the intruder; his romance with a female rat he meets in the sewer; and an evil, masterminded frog who has a diabolical plot but needs a cable to carry his evil plan - a cable which the female rat is using for a belt.  There's also a sub-plot about a fake ruby.  There are excellent chase scenes on sewer boats, as the evil frog's French cousin and his gang try to catch the female rat with the cable around her waist.  For me, the way this film mocks the French is perhaps the funniest part.

No spoiler alerts here, except to say that the Tom Jones song ""What's Up, Pussycat?"" is played during the final credits.",1470614400,,817,4.251612903225807

He likes a movie and will watch it until he memorizes it.  And when I suggest trying a new one, he tells me that he doesn't want a new one.  So I usually purchase one without telling him and just put it on... then he comes into the living room he will usually just sit down and start watching it.  I will know if he likes it if when I let him pick the movie later, he picks one he watched before.... Flushed Away was one that he has picked on numerous occasions.  I purchase Over the Hedge at about the same time, and he hasn't asked for that one...not even once.",1452124800,,712,4.0212765957446805

It was recorded by Bobby Vinton. When I asked him where he learned or heard that song, he told me that it was from an animated movie called ""Flushed Away."" I asked him if he liked the movie, and he told me that he did. And so I ordered it. I also had the song put on a CD and brought the song up on YouTube so that he could watch the entire song. I think he was surprised to see what the song was truly about. Anyway, my grandson loves the movie and it brought back memories for me as I served in Vietnam between 1965 and 1966.",1408838400,9,679,3.9635036496350367

There were references only adults would get, and silly comedy kids love, with no innuendo or anything to explain.  It's a sweet story with a smart and self-sufficient heroine, and it teaches lessons such as valuing family and loved ones without being preachy.  Surprisingly worthwhile given the poor title.",1397433600,,375,4.920634920634921

2723486,5,B000M343BC,"Gotta love Aardman animation.  Along with Pixar they produce animated features
of wit, intelligence, fun and inventiveness.  Pixar goes deeper, more for the heart,
and for my money may make the slightly greater films.

But Aardman's droll, playful mix of adult wordplay and family fun action, and, especially
great characters (voices here include Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen, all
of whom are in fine form) make their films really special.  The singing slugs alone are
enough to make this a great time.",1376784000,2,517,5.119047619047619

2723525,4,B000M343BC,"Flushed Away is a fun filled and imaginative romp.
The film is computer animated but done to resemble claymation style of animation like Wallace & Gromit cartoons. This allows the film makers to have the look of a hand crafted film but with much smoother animation.  The backgrounds are stunning and impressive in the details added to them.  The ""Sewer London"" is suprisingly beautiful.  The characters are equally well developed and rendered as well.
The film boasts a stellar voice cast with Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellan, Andy Serkis, and Jean Reno in the lead roles.  All bring their ""A"" games to the table instead of just dialing it in.
The writing and pacing are both very well done.  There are enough jokes, gags, and puns to keep most age ranges laughing.  Much like Shrek, there are several slightly risque jokes that will sail right over the heads of younger kids but provide the parents with a chuckle.",1357516800,,924,4.779874213836478

2723529,4,B000M343BC,"This movie answers the ancient question that weaves it way into the other wise restful slumbers of parents world wide:
Does every family movie have to be written to the Disney Formula?

In 2006, Dream Works was not yet tied to Disney. In Flushed Away they proved that a movie can be family fun and not entirely formulaic.
Plot outline:
Favored house pet, Roddy St. James(Hugh Jackman)is a spoiled mouse living in splendid isolation, free to live it up in a world of his imagination, rich children's toys and no contact with any other animals. In a sudden reversal of fortune, he is flushed out of his deluxe apartment in the sky - ok its Kensington, England and down the tubes into the sewer. Here he finds a decidedly Dickensian London world inhabited by all manner of small fury and not so fury denizens.

He quickly becomes involved with a truly underworld, underworld crime boss(Ian McKellen as The Toad), his heavy duty dirty rats and a beautiful mouse maiden in distress. Rita Pantsed mouse (Kate Winslet) is plucky, fiercely independent and not at all impressed with the cut of Roddy, but events keep them together on a classic jewel quest.

So far all of this sounds very traditional and predictable. The structure is. The details are not.

The standard model kiddie/family movie is:
Lots of humor in the beginning; include a few references for the parents
Add in some romance, but keep it at arms length, nothing to offend kiddies' sensibilities or to rouse the ""Girls are Yucky"" in the younger boy viewers
Slowly add in the danger, bringing in enough violence to allow for chase scenes and maybe demonstrate some heroics
By about the  way mark there are few or no jokes until...
At the happy resolution a few final jokes are allowed to offset the resolution of the romance and some maudlin emotions

Flushed away is funny beginning to end. Yes we have chases and typical kid's movie violence. The emphasis is always on fun. The violence is more in the way of adventure than people, ok animal getting hurt.

Dream Works made excellent use of the folks behind the claymation series Wallace and Grommet. Flushed Away is computer animated, but the characters have something of the warmth and physical depth that their W and G artists achieve in clay.

On the personal side, I loved the chorus of singing slugs. To see such an ancient theater tradition revived is such a totally unlikely venue was hysterical. The little guys were magically used to set the tone of scene after scene and to warn the viewers on what to expect next. In other words exactly what an ancient chorus is supposed to do.

Bottom line:
For very few dollars you can entertain the kids, have plenty of fun for the supervising adults, and almost forget that you are eating popcorn.",1350691200,,2757,4.703319502074689

2723565,3,B000M343BC,"I suppose a bit of my own disappointment with this particular film stems from the very fact that Aardman's domestic advertising campaign coupled to DreamWorks boasting that it came from the creators of Shrek left me expecting something much more grandiose then what actually exists here.

What does exist here is an 85-minute tale of one Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman), a decidedly high-class pet rat who makes his home in a polished brass cage within in a posh Kensington flat.

His high society existence comes to a screeching halt when a common sewer rat named Sid pops out of the kitchen sink and decides to stay, especially considering their home land of England happens to be playing arch nemesis Germany in the FIFA World Cup final and what posh Kensington flat isn't complete without a 60-inch flat-screen?

Roddy, sensing the threat to his lifestyle that a dirty, sloppy sewer rat could pose, decides to get rid of Sid by luring him into the ""jacuzzi"", which is in fact the toilet. With the pull of the lever, he could send ol Sid back from once he came.  Classless and manner-less Sid may be, but plumbing he understands! He plays along and instead pushes Roddy into the toilet and flushes him away instead.

There, Roddy meets Rita Malone (Kate Winslet), and high adventure, narrow escapes, and nautical chases ensue.

Reviewers who claimed Flushed Away contains a certain British charm have hit the nail right on the head.  The humor is the odd combination of dry witty dialog (with cultural references galore) and over-the-top slapstick.  Theoretically this should be the secret to success in appealing to everyone (little something for the adults to enjoy while the youngsters snicker at the onscreen antics) but unless the viewer is prepared for the type of sublime dry dialog exchanges that happen without warning, much of the humor and charm could go undetected.

I was particularly impressed with Aardman's ability to duplicate the stop-motion clay animation look of their earlier films and series through use of laser scanning and software animating.  Many of the textures are remarkably lifelike and, not unlike the dialog, require careful examination to appreciate the layers of depth and pop culture references scattered about.

The vocal work is top notch with Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen delivering voice performances no less potent than the live-action deliveries that each is known for.

In all Flushed Away comes off as a charming little romp with a bit more underlying depth (no pun intended) than is common in animated feature films.  It's undeniably Aardman though which means it isn't quite as in your face or over the top as a majority of the DVDs wearing the famous DreamWorks logo.",1283644800,,2731,4.962719298245614

While I am sure children will just enjoy the fun of the story adults may actually be more entertained not only by the story, but by the music, character portrayals (the slugs are marvelous!), and humor.  Hugh Jackman is a fabulous Roddy, so clearly conveying his ""personality"" on the character that at times you can almost see him rather than the rat.  Kate Winslet is super playing Rita, and Ian McKellen as always delivers a delightful performance, evil and yet fun at the same time.

2723571,3,B000M343BC,"""Flushed Away"" is a CG animation produced by DreamWorks and Aardman, companies that brought us wildly imaginative and hugely entertaining ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit."" Their new collaboration ""Flushed Away"" is as an enjoyable ride as the Oscar-winning predecessor, but the creativity and imagination of Wallace and Gromit are somehow missing.

Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is a pet mouse living in a posh house in Kensington. His affluent life is suddenly over, however, when he is literally ""flushed away"" by an intruder, a sewer mouse named Sid (Shane Richie). Through the pipes Roddy goes deep down into the underworld, where he encounters a feisty, street-smart female mouse Rita (Kate Winslet), who is being chased by the scheming kingpin ""The Toad"" (Ian McKellen).

""Flushed Away"" suffers from underdeveloped characters and weak storyline. Of all the animation characters I have ever seen, Roddy is probably the least interesting hero. All Roddy wants to do is going up above, back to his old house, and it is not a very difficult thing to do (Sid already did that). Hugh Jackman does his best, but voice acting is not his forte, and many of his scenes are stolen by The Toad's ridiculously incompetent henchmen Whitey and Spike (Bill Nighy and Andy Sarkis) and the singing slugs.

According to IMDb, as many as five credited screenplay writers (and another six writers who did additional screenplay material) were attached to the project. But you will notice there is someone who should be here. For all funny slapstick jokes, pop culture references (""Finding Nemo"" ""Batman"" etc.) and visual detail of the London underworld, ""Flushed Away"" is a little disappointing, lacking Nick Park's creative genius.",1254528000,6,1734,5.141843971631205

2723575,5,B000M343BC,"What a fun and whimsical movie with the usual Dreamworks state of the art animation.  The computer generated animation gives the characters a semi-claylike look - but not too much.

This is a funny film with rats and mice in the city of London.  Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman) is a pet mouse who lives in a cage shaped like a castle or a fine house.  He has everything he needs and plenty of toys to play with.  He comes across as a ""James Bond"" wannabe mouse.  English accent and fine clothes to appeal to his Barbie Doll pretend friends.

A fat rat of the streets, named Sid (Shane Richie) pops up out of the sink one day when Roddy's owner's have left him alone.  They are out of the house as Roddy hops in his play car with two of his Barbie Doll ""Friends"".  Sid is gross and demanding.  He wants the same life as Roddy.  Roddy does not want Sid around, disrupting his fine times and good food.  He thinks he can trick Sid into jumping into the toilet - tells him it is a ""Spa"" with a ""whirlpool"".  Sid knows it is a toilet and Roddy ends up being flushed away down to subterranean Metropolis - similar to London but for smaller animals and frogs, snails, etc...

Rita (Kate Winslet), a smart, cute young attractive female rat meets Roddy. Roddy and Rita team up after some mishaps, and changes in plans.  There is a villainous Toad (Sir Ian McKellen) and singing snails (delightful songs interspersed throughout).  The toad hates rodents and has sent two goofy hench rats, Spike (Andy Serkis) and Whitey (Bill Nighy),  and his cousin -- Le Frog (Jean Reno) - to see that Roddy and Rita are frozen alive with his other victims.  Liquid Nitrogen is used to do this.

Rita and Roddy are smart and brave and together escape and are chased through several exciting scenes.  The movie is engaging and fun - and as usual the animation is fabulous!",1252800000,,1845,4.4183976261127595

I shouldn't have been. It was funny and entertaining, and I never got bored or irritated with it. Even my teenager laughed, and he's a hard sell.

Roddy (Hugh Jackman) is a pet rat with a posh life--a gilded cage, and when the humans are away, he can do as he pleases, with the dolls from the dollhouse for companionship. Then one day, the house is invaded by a sewer rat named Sid, and when Roddy tries to lure him into the ""jacuzzi,"" Roddy's the one who gets flushed instead.

He ends up in and underground rat city that's busy and full of cute details I had to pause to check out on DVD because there was no way I could catch all of them--things like a teacup ride made from actual teacups, what looked like Lego flowers, and hand-mixer jet skis. It reminded me very much of the Borrowers or the Littles books from when I was a kid.

All Roddy wants is to get home, and in his quest, he gets help from Rita (Kate Winslet)--as long as he promises to pay her, that is--and runs afoul of The Toad. The various characters are a hoot--from the singing slugs to the French ninja frogs, led by LeFrog (Jean Reno), who not only fight, but bring along their own mime.

Roddy's character arc is predictable, but at least he has one, and he and Rita have interesting and distinct personalities.

One thing we all found amusing was that the rats were all into the World Cup, and especially the reaction of the American rat--after living through World Cup fever here in Germany a couple of summers ago.

The story follows a posh pet mouse (Roddy) who finds himself lost in the sewers of London.  Roddy wants to go back home and the adventures begin.  He meets Rita along the way who has the means to help him get back ""up top"" but things are not as easy as he thought.  Rita has problems of her own.  Flushed away has an intelligent plot with some silly slugginess along the way.",1215648000,,772,4.2620689655172415

Best part of the film are the characters, storyline & Rita, the leading lady of this film (Kate Winslet is the voice of Rita), who is a true role model for all girls as she doesn't need to be saved by any man and she even manages to save the leading man, Roddy, in this film!!",1211932800,,456,4.123595505617978

2723592,4,B000M343BC,"One day, my British roommate was watching this movie and he told me to sit down and watch it with him. I saw that it was an animation and quickly glanced at the slapstick silliness of it and said, ""Eh, not now"". Months later a friend gave me this movie in a pile of films to borrow. Yet still, I saved this movie as one of the last to watch. Its so funny how one can misperceive and so quickly brush off a film based on a few glimpses of it. I surely did this, later finding out this is one of the most exciting animation films I have seen in along time. Aardman Animation and Dreamworks team up for an endearing and entertaining storyline.  Aardman has brought us the clay/stop-motion animation of Wallace and Gromit. In Flushed Away, one can see the influences the medium of clay have on this film. At times the film is clearly CGI, other times clay-like.

As for the characters, we have some wonderful ones in this film. The main characters and their personalities are so well-developed, however it is the little characters in the film that make this film feel whole...you will love the slugs and the ninja frogs. In Flushed Away, the writer does what all good animation or fantasy does; creates a world existing in our world, but is hidden. Roddy St. James, the main character in the film, is a pet mouse completely unaware that there is an entire mouse/rat city a toilet flush away. So much fun. Sure to please children and adults. This movie is a must for no other reason then to see where animation is going.",1209340800,,1515,4.4071428571428575
2723593,5,B000M343BC,"Flushed Away was a very satisfying animated film about a mouse who's living in a palace in England.  When the people leave the house, he leaves his cage, and goes on one of the craziest adventures anyone can possibly have.

One night the poor mouse hears a loud noise in the kitchen, and to his shock, a fat rat comes popping out of the kitchen sink.  The rat then goes on to force the mouse out of his own house by flushing him down a toilet.  This is where the adventure comes in.

He eventually finds himself in what you can call a ""mouse paradise"".  Mice roaming around everywhere in a big town in the sewers.  From there, the story really begins when another character is introduced.

There's adventure, there's excitement, and there's plenty of twists and fast-paced moving action to satisfy kids and keep adults entertained as well.  I can't find a single complaint.

I LOVED the singing slugs, the angry controlling frogs, and the fat rat who tried to rule the palace where the mouse once lived.  These were all very entertaining characters.  I loved the movie.",1206662400,,1069,4.597883597883598
2723594,3,B000M343BC,"Well, not really because I watched this while walking on my treadmill, which is a great way to avoid the ""bla bla number of minutes of my life I'll never get back"" scenario.

This movie left me feeling like I'd been dumped in the toilet, flushed, swirled around, and fished out again.  84 minutes of virtually non-stop action with little or no character development left me feeling like ""what...was...that?"".

I expected more of Aardman than this.  The reason why I fell in love with Wallace and Gromit is because the Aardman people did so much with so little:  slight movements, eye expressions, and subtle humor let me get to know the characters so that when the action happened it was truly unpredictable and funny, and the same joke wasn't run into the ground.

In this movie, they did so little with so much.  The animation technology really impressed me, but the characters didn't.  The main ""hero"" rat that we meet up front is such a non-entity of a personality that I really didn't care if he lived or died during the course of the movie.

And the story?  Spoiled rat meets cute non-married jewel thief mom rat who stole a jewel from a gang of theiving frogs, and spoiled rat's solution is to go back to his owners home and steal their jewelry and give it to the mom rat.  So, it's all about stealing stuff, but what makes theft right or wrong is the context.  Those humans didn't need those jewels anyway.

That said, I got a pleasant surprise at the end where the singing slugs do the Ike and Tina Turner version of Proud Mary (a favorite classic tune of mine) and that followed up with Tom Jones singing ""What's New Pussycat"", which was my first favorite song from the radio that I remember hearing when I was four years old.

I am sure this will be fun for the whole family. The humor covers a wide range from physical to witty satire.

The story centers around a high class pet rat that is flushed out of his home literally by a sewer rat. When he ends up in the sewer rat city he must try to survive the new environment and make new friends. Unfortunately he gets caught up in a fight over a large gem between a female rat ship captain and a rat mafia boss that is a frog. Add in some French frog henchman and things get bizaar.

2723602,4,B000M343BC,"""Flushed Away"" may be another CGI-produced animated film replete with celebrity voiceovers (the most bloated sub-genre out there), but the darn thing has its charms, including its fantastic sense of humor, directly taken from the stop-motion Aardman ""Wallace & Gromit"" films as well as ""Chicken Run.""  This is not surprising, as Dreamworks teamed up with Aardman to make an animated film that looks more like ""Chicken Run"" than ""The Incredibles.""  Some of that quirky stop-motion sensibility has clearly permeated this film, and that is its saving grace.

The plot is ordinary.  Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman) is a pet rat in an upper-crust house in Kensington - apparently a ritzy neighborhood in London.  Roddy's owners head out for a few days' holiday, and Roddy romps around the house, playing with the toys and pretending to be James Bond.  The theme is perhaps given away by the playing of Billy Idol's ""Dancin' with Myself"" during this scene.  Future lessons about the values of friendship on the horizon, perhaps?

All too soon, Roddy's idyll is invaded by Sid, a sewer rat.  Push comes to shove and Roddy's attempt to flush Sid down the toilet backfires.  Roddy falls into an alternative version of London in its sewers populated by a whole rat society, which gives the filmmakers a gazillion opportunities to make little jokes . . . and they do so in spades.  Repeat viewings are required to catch all the little gags, and they never fail to please.

Roddy then gets caught up in a ridiculous jewel heist involving Rita (Kate Winslet), who has gone against the Sewer-London's crime lord, the Toad (Ian McKellen).  The Toad also has visions of sewer-domination and wiping out the rat civilization - using a clever ploy involving England's fixation on the World Cup finals.  To this end, the Toad enlists his French cousin, Le Frog (Jean Reno) and his sidekicks.  As an example of the witty British sensibility that permeates this film, when Le Frog yells ""To action!"" to rally his band of henchfrogs, the henchfrogs immediately raise their arms and shout, ""We surrender!""

Look for some amazing animation in ""Flushed Away,"" particularly with some chase scenes through the sewers of London.  But the joys of this movie are found in the jokes, no doubt about it.  And while the movie is not stolen by minor characters as in some other animated movies (such as where the penguins completely swipe ""Madagascar""), a bevy of slugs do their best to provide the movie's great moments.

While surely not the best animated movie out there, ""Flushed Away"" still stands out among the dreck that has piled up in recent years.  While not in the class of ""Ratatouille"" or even ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"" ""Flushed Away"" is nevertheless a solid entry into the family film library.  The DVD has some decent extras, but nothing to write home about.",1193011200,,2839,4.88517745302714

In the sewer, Roddy meets Rita, a captain of a boat.  However, she had a ruby that once was adorned on the Queen's crown.  But soon, Toad has sent his henchmen to capture the ruby back.  In the midst of staking their claims on the ruby, Rita and Roddy escape.  To make things worse, Toad is even more upset because, unknown to Rita and Roddy, Rita has taken an electric cable.

So, of course, there's another chase which Toad has enlisted the service of his French cousin, Le Frog and his ninja team.  While escaping, Roddy is trying to find his way back home.  However, he's also falling for Rita.  Which will Roddy choose...love or his posh mansion?

Ths film fared poorly in the the box office and only just made back it's $100 odd million budget, mainly because of the amount of other films and people seemingly getting sick of ""another CGI film"". Those of you who have not seen this gem, you are missing out. The humour is pure british and some will miss the cultural jokes. Scots and Welsh viewers don't have a heartattack when you see the unionjack representing England. It was the best way to get the message across in the movie regarding the World Cup final plot device involving england and Germany.

The characters are well conceived and animated. My favourite is ""Le Frog"" and his evil henchmen including a frog version of Marcel Marceaux or should that be ""MyCell"" you'll get the picture.

Alot of Aardman ""traits"" can be seen in the computer animated characters. The reason for going to CGI was because trying to emulate water in traditional stop motion animation, would have been too complicated, since the story is based in the London sewers, it made sense to go with computer power.

The voices of all the characters are exceptionally cast, including Hugh Jackman as Roddy the upper crust pet rat from ""up top"". Kate Winslett as Rita a sewerwise scavenger rat with Jean Reno as ""Le Frog"" and Sir Ian Mckellen as the evil ""Toad"". There are some slight ineuendos (sorry if I got the spelling wrong) to justify the PG rating. But otherall a brilliant cartoon, which deserves its following.

I never planned on seeing this movie. I hate these overdone CGI animal adventure movies. Doogal. Barnyard. Over the flippin' hedge. Happy Feet (though that one was ok). Besides crappy romantic comedies, they're the most overdone film genre of all-time.

But, as it so happens, I found myself on a bus to Six Flags in Massachusetts one day as part of a college reunion my dad was in (there was a program for the kids, and our group, age 15-17, was going to Six Flags one day), and they were showing this film, ""Flushed Away,"" on the bus.

Meh. I had nothing better to do. Sleep? I just woke up like a minute and a half ago, it was 9:00 in the morning. Study for my exam I was taking off-campus on Saturday? Yeah, right. Watch ""Flushed Away"" for no apparent reason whatsoever? Sounds like a plan!

Ok, so basically, ""Flushed Away"" is about this lonely (but almost scarily elated) rat named Roddy who gets flushed down the loo one day and discovers a huge underworld city in the sewers of London where other rats live. He meets this girl scavenger rat named Rita who looks for treasures in the sewers and he keeps ruining things for her on her boat...thus Rita gets a huge sense of resentment for this poor rat. Roddy needs to get back to Kensington (hehe, I love that place) where he lives...but has no plan of doing so. Rita just so happens to have a dilemma as well: she has this quarrel with a big toad named...er...the Toad who stole a ruby from her that was going to make her poor family wealthy again. Roddy agrees to help Rita get the ruby back in return for her help in getting him back to the land ""up top."" (Kensington)

As you can see from my basic plot summary, ""Flushed Away"" is an odd film. It has some fantastic voice talent, though, starring Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, and Bill Nighy. It also is pretty funny with tons of British humour (oh, did I mention the evil Toad is trying to rig all the toilets in London to suck the people in during the half-time break at the World Cup? hehe  ) and it reminded me immensely of Nick Park's brilliant ""Wallace and Grommit"" series. There are references to tons of other adult movies that only we would get. The soundtrack is fantastic as well with some very good tunes, including a track by The Dandy Warhols.

Overall--funny, entertaining, and enjoyable, but probably not worth seeing again. It kind of struck me as one of the kids' animated films that didn't exactly work for me, and (most of them) usually do. Ok for one-time viewing.

He sets of on a journey to find his way home, and finds himself interwined in a plot to destroy this sewage London. He learns the importance of family, friednship, and must make some important choices.

I have to admit I WAS skeptical about this movie.  I've never been fond of the previous Aardman efforts.  The Lipless, wide mouthed toothy expressions really weirded me out, and I just nevet thought they were very funny.  After seeing clips of this movie being demoed in a store, my interest grew and I rented it. and LOVED it!

As CGI films seem to go, it attempts to gear jokes to both parents and children, but unlike other movies, the adult jokes are clean enough that if the children DO get them, it won't destroy them, and even the silliest of childish jokes can get a chuckle out of a dirty minded adult (like myself).  There was the occassional joke or gag that wasn't what I would call funny, but those were VERY few and VERY far between.

Funny, charming, and at times just plain silly, ""Flushed Away"" is a rarity nowadays]- especially amongst CGI films that seem to pop up EVERYWHERE.  It's creative and EXTREMELY enjoyable!  THe voice actors are TOP notch, and the characters are loveable and entertaining.

I also have to add that the slugs were DEFINITLEY the best part! Singing helium voiced versions of songs from modern to ""classic"" (more or less) and original songs here and there.",1178150400,,1750,4.609677419354838

The visuals are stunning, the voice talent is the best and most seamless in recent memory, and there is quite literally a laugh-a-minute (for Mom & Dad, too!).

The filmmakers' attention to detail was truly remarkable.  Repeat viewings yield more and more chuckles as you'll notice smart in-jokes and running gags.  The french frog (get it?) swat team wears (what else?) frog suits.  One of them does a hilarious turn as a mime.  At their first call to action, they promptly surrender.

The voice casting was truly first-rate.  Hugh Jackman plays the wide-eyed rat-out-of-comfy-cage role perfectly.  Kate Winslet infuses sassy fun into her hip, Euro-cool, street-wise rat.  Ian McKellan is positively brilliant as the flamboyant frog with a secret vendetta.

The pacing is very much akin to the Indiana Jones series - brisk cliff-hangers with a healthy infusion of humor - but with a more kid-friendly set of scenarios and characters.  Still, when watching it with my young child, most of the big belly laughs were coming from Daddy.

2723640,3,B000M343BC,"It's a bad sign when, after watching the film, the only thing really worth remembering was slugs. Yes, for all its technical marvel and impressive cast list, the only thing that really entertained me were singing slugs. It's hard to figure out where the problem was but it's just something that nagged throughout the whole thing: this should be making me laugh and it's only doing it in parts and even then, the humor didn't even look part of the intended joke. It's not really a terrible film but it's hard to wholeheartedly recommend and refrain from suggesting a better film instead.

Roddy is a pampered rat living in a posh house in England. He plays and daydreams but he's by himself, which he's aware of constantly. One day, a couch potato/slob of a rat comes out of the sink and flushes Roddy down the toilet. A fish out of water among the sewer folk, he runs into Rita, a street-wise rat who's in trouble with the local frog mob boss. Roddy reluctantly teams up with Rita and eventually have to stop the frog's scheme and become friends and potentially something more.

The humor of the film feels like a mix between British humor and American humor as seen through a Britishman's eyes. Even though we're a little sick of fart, burp and hit-in-the-crotch jokes, apparently they don't think so and we got tons. Some will laugh a lot and find the film charming while others will probably barely laugh. Another knock, although it's not as bad as Dreamworks' stuff, is the cast list. Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman plays Roddy and while he does an admirable job, you can tell the voice acting stuff is new to him and he gets overshadowed by everyone else, along with Kate Winslet. Highlights though are Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis as henchmen and Jean Reno as a french bad guy.

The look of the film though works as well although it seems odd at times. The basic premise is claymation-looking characters but animated in the computer. So while everything was done in the computer, the characters look as if they were done in the Aardman-style of stop motion animation like Wallace and Gromit. On one hand, it gives the film a unique look while on the other, having thumbprints on the clay or mouth movements looking noticeably choppy feels distracting. Either go fully 3D worlds and characters or make the world look as if it was stop-motion animated as well. But the way it is just feels clunky.

Is it watchable and something to recommend? Maybe. You wouldn't think an animated film will have a ""love it or hate it"" vibe but that's what I get here. I don't hate it but this is far below what was expected.",1175385600,7,2604,4.593548387096774

2723648,4,B000M343BC,"I'll admit it.  I was thought that Aardman going CG with their animation was a bad idea.  Part of the appeal of their work was that they still used dolls, clay and traditional stop motion.  You could see and appreciate the time the movie took to make and almost feel the love for the art coming right through your set.  Sure CG has a place in the world of animation, but also believe firmly in keeping the older arts alive and thriving.  Aardman was doing a great job with their stop motion work; why change a good thing?

Part of it was technical.  ""Flushed Away"" contains so many scenes with water and fluids rising, splashing and whirling that stop motion would have been next to impossible.  CG was the best way to handle it.  Luckily Aardman kept their traditional look to their characters.  In the end, the mix works wonderfully.  The film is dynamic, fast paced and lots of fun.  The CG helps, and doesn't stand out at all.  In fact the movie is full of details in backgrounds and throw away sight gags that you can watch it multiple times to take it all in.

The voice casting and performances are excellent.  Everyone seems to be having a great time with their parts and somehow manages to make you forget you are listening to a bunch of A-list celebraties.  I'd hate to single any one performance out, because they were all so good.  The score and songs used in the film also work wonderfully.  The songs are picked because they fit the film (and are not shoehorned into the movie to sell the soundtrack), and that is refreshing.

If there is anything wrong with the movie its the simple fact that the script feels overly worked to make it more family friendly.  In other words, some of the simple charms that Aardman has in their films has been polished and scrubbed away.  The film has a total of 15 writers working on it.  At times you can almost feel the number of hands working on this cake.  Some of the jokes have the feel of ""let's put this in here, because kids love that kind of stuff"".  It makes moments in the film seem a bit unnatural and not really in line with previous Aardman films.  However, I doubt anyone but a serious fan of their work would notice.

With that said, I recommend this movie.  It's not as good as ""Wallace and Gromit"", but really what is?  It's great fun, and the voice acting is top notch.  Its too bad that the movie did so poorly in theaters.  it didn't deserve it at all.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.",1174521600,6,2448,4.349557522123894

2723656,5,B000M343BC,"This is a delightful movie.  The visuals are a top notch, but the characterizations are even better.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet play the romantic leads as Roddy and Rita.  He is a upper crust pet rat from Kensington (a suburb within London) and Rita comes from down down down in the sewers.  The rats down there seem to have built their city.

They meet because Roddy's family (owners) leave for a vacation.  Roddy entertains himself as best he can when out of the pipes comes Sid (Shane Ritchie) who clearly comes from somewhere less refined.  Sid announces he is taking over and Roddy's plan to get rid of Sid backfires and Roddy ends up flushed into the sewers.  Roddy tries to get some help to get back to Kensington, which leads him to Rita.  She has real troubles of her own and Roddy's troubles multiply.

Ian McKellen plays Toad, the big boss of this underworld.  He wants something that he claims Rita took, and has some secret plan that I won't get into here.  His main two henchmen are Whitey (the large one - played by Bill Nighy who played Davey Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean 2) and Spike (the small one - played by Andy Sirkis who played Gollum in Lord of the Rings and King Kong).  These two have some great lines together.

Toad also enlists the help of Le Frog (Jean Reno - who has played so many wonderful roles) and his own band of henchfrogs.  And being French they have many lines related to those quirks.  For example, Le Frog says, ""We now have a mission!  Let nothing stand in our way!  We leave immediately!""  One of the henchfrongs asks, ""What about dinner?"".  Silence.  Then Le Frog says, ""We leave in five hours!!""

I am sure there has never been a movie that has used slugs so extensively and to such good effect.  They form a kind of chorus that supplies some of the movie's incidental music, its ambient music, some commentary on the scenes and even draw on our sympathy when they seem threatened.  Essentially, they are the movie's chorus.

While trying to get back to the surface, and escape from the evil Godfather-like Toad (Ian McKellan) and his henchman, (Bill Nighy and Andy Serkis), mayhem ensues and a good family-friendly time is had by all.

The 84 minute film makes up for its thin plot by throwing in singing slugs every now and then, or randomly inserting a movie reference. There are plenty of laughs here (although there are also quite a few gags that fall flat), and the voice-actors are brilliant, but the ""I'm so lonely and I never realized it"" plot line has been played out so many times (and much more effectively) that it seems a bit too bland of an ending by the time you get to it.

The DVD extras are enjoyable. A short ""meet the cast"" featurette definitely provides the kind of information and peek behind the scenes that any enjoyer of animation loves to see. Each actor talks about their character and the overall process.",1173225600,4,1194,4.60093896713615

First, I should probably say why I initially resisted it... 1) The whole concept was unappealing. 2) A long-time fan of Aardman, I had been disappointed by ""W&G and the Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". 3) I knew that this was done with CGI in the style of claymation and that kinda turned me off.

The concept proved much more appealing in its entirety than was evident in the trailers. The plot is serviceable, the casting and the voice talent are uniformly excellent. The plot is certainly better, and better executed, than ""Were-Rabbit"". The animation was top notch. To be sure it was highly stylized CGI to emulate claymation, but it worked brilliantly.

Certainly, the characters are more believable and sympathetic than in ""Were-Rabbit"". Oddly enough, the ones who pretty much steal the show are the slugs who form a very bizarre Greek chorus.

Flushed Away does not disappoint at all. The characters are very funny and charming, specially Roddy and the slugs. This movie also won the Annie Awards for:

Best Animated Effects

Best Character Animation in a Feature Production

Best Production Design in an Animated Feature Production

Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature Production

Best Writing in an Animated Feature Production

The Annie Awards honors lifetime achievements in the field of animation and related categories.

So definitely this movie is a winner in all senses. I would be happier if it was nominated for an Oscar. When I went to see, Monster House, people was so bored that many left the theater... even though I found it OK. Cars was really good, but not for Kids, they were playing all around the theater since the movie is too complicated for a Kid's mind. So, the adults were the ones who really enjoyed it.

Flushed Away is a PG-rated feature from a studio that focuses on stop-motion clay animation.  This movie is a cartoon but retains that feel and also is set in an underground sewer city.  Roddy lives a great life as a pet, but gets flushed into the sewer.  The movie focuses on Roddy's efforts to get back to the surface.  Roddy, voiced by Hugh Jackman, joins with Kate Winslett as they try and outwit the evil frog who has plans to destroy the entire sewer to get rid of all the rats.

The pace of this movie could best be described as frantic.  The jokes come fast and furious and non-stop.  Some will be hard to understand for the kids because of the British accents of the characters and the content geared toward adults.  The slugs in the sewer are the best part of the movie, as they show up at opportune times to comment via song.

This is a kid's movie that adults may just like better than the children.",1170374400,4,1182,4.255605381165919
2723674,5,B000M343BC,"I checked this out because of the voice talent (you don't get better than Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Ian McKellen) and because I love animated films, but this was far beyond what I expected.  The animation looks vintage Aardman Studios (home of Wallace and Grommit), but it's all CGI because water is very difficult to do stop motion.  I was blown away by the multitude of jokes, visual and verbal, in the film, and I know I missed a lot of them -- look at the contents of Roddy's closet, pay attention to what the cocroach is reading, etc.

Top kudos go to Ian McKellen, who voices the baddie -- I can just see the director telling him to pull out all the stops and him rubbing his hands in glee.  His performance is operatically over the top and screamingly funny.  The humor is on two levels -- adults will get some of them, kids will get some, and everyone will have a good time.  And as my title suggests, the slugs are worth the price of admission alone -- go through the credits for a very funny 'disclaimer' concerning them at the end of the film.  They really need to meet Skrat from the Ice Age films ...  Rent or buy this and be prepared for a great time!",1169683200,2,1171,4.266968325791855

His mission, along with a female rodent (Rita), is to get Roddy back home while keeping the evil toad from doing harm.

2723676,3,B000M343BC,"Well I took my 6 year old to the cinemas and wasn't expecting much from Grommit look-alikes. Sad to report, there's a lot of non-stop action, hiding a lack of much else going on in the film. The story is tired. Three or four self-conscious laughs, and those all from accompanying adults. Given that my previous excursion to the cinemas was for another brace of scatalogical humour, the hugely entertaining gag from Melbourne, 'Kenny', the letdown was severe, the flushout, complete. There's no problem with cleverness; part of Shrek's hugely populist appeal are the asides and references to other films. But this one just doesn't cut it, and the references present as mere cliches. And you are on risky ground when you adopt a lookalike Grommit cartoon style. Inevitably it will recall the original, and the creative art has to be impeccable to warrant such an echo. Here, we recall Grommit and measure everything this lacks, intimacy, patience, and crucially, loving detail.",1167782400,2,975,5.0246913580246915

I haven't laughed so much at a movie since Shrek and Shrek2. Even better was that I didn't notice curse words littered throughout the ""kid movie"".  This was the first movie my 3 1/2 year old actually sat in his chair all the way through...that means NOT strapped to a stroller or struggling to keep in grown up chair.  He paid attention all the way through because it visually kept his attention and he understood the basic concepts of the movie...flushing toilet, being chased, etc. I look forward to adding Flushed Away to the dvd collection.

2723679,5,B000M343BC,"Before, after, or I would suggest instead of allowing your children to be indoctrinated into refusing to eat their fish sticks (and possibly refusing to go to church) by a flock of singing and dancing computer animated penguins in the exquisite but execrable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Feet/dp/B00005JPCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Feet</a>, I recommend treating them to this overlooked gem, which is not pushing any discernible message except perhaps that it is better not to be alone.

Rodney St. James (Hugh Jackman) is the pampered pet rat of a little rich girl who like all humans doesn't realize that animals can talk.  Thus Rodney's social interactions are limited to his owner's dolls when she is not around.  After the girl and her family leave for a week-long trip he spends the first day humorously if somewhat poignantly partying with the dolls until his somewhat lonely if well-ordered interlude is shattered by the arrival of a coarse, unrefined, and too tough to beat up sewer rat, Sid (Shane Richie), who takes one look at Roddy's posh Kensington pad and announces that he is staying.  Roddy's desperate attempt to get rid of Sid by convincing him that the toilet is a Jacuzzi backfires (because Sid is not quite THAT stupid) so that it is Roddy who gets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flushed-Away/dp/B000M343BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flushed Away</a>.

What he discovers to his (and the audience's) surprise is a miniature sewer rat version of London built from discarded materials and chock full of wonder and sight gags, but Roddy has eyes for none of it as he is desperate to find a way to get back home to deal with Sid before his owner returns.  Inquiries lead him to the salvage boat (also built of salvage, naturally) Jammy Dodger, captained by the tough and working class Rita (Kate Winslet) who is struggling to support her large family and being hunted by The Toad (Ian McKellen), the malevolent amphibious kingpin of the local rat Mob, because she has something he wants.  Roddy's attempt to ingratiate himself with the Toad by giving him what he wants backfires when the same clumsiness that gave him the opportunity causes him to destroy the Toad's ""priceless"" collection of Royal Family memorabilia.  Sentenced to being ""iced"" (literally), Rita and Roddy are forced to flee together, unknowingly taking something the Toad wants back even more than the first item, leading the Toad's hench-rats a merry chase through the sewers of London, and finally forcing the overly theatrical Toad to call in his dreaded mercenary cousin, Le Frog (Jean Reno), to finish the job and restore to him the Key to his Sinister Plot.

Unfortunately this capsule synopsis cannot do justice to this joke-a-minute joy, which includes clever and sprightly dialogue, sight gags galore, hysterically self-parodying voice acting by McKellen and Reno in particular, a running gag involving a Greek Chorus of singing slugs, out-of-nowhere references to everything from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finding-Nemo/dp/B00005JM02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finding Nemo</a>&nbsp;to the old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B00005LOUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;TV series, the best mime bit I've ever seen, the best waterborne movie chase since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-and-Let-Die/dp/B000LY209E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live and Let Die</a>, a never ending series of French jokes, and even Hugh Jackman's excuse for a singing voice.

Defects?  Well, there might be a few too many belching, farting, and injury to crotch jokes for some (though at least in this movie they are FUNNY), and, no surprise in a mile-a-minute movie like this, some of the plot points won't QUITE make sense on later reflection (Just what was Rita planning to do with a human-sized jewel, could hench-rats really ride mixers like Jet Skis, and where exactly did the liquid nitrogen come from?).  However the total effect is a tidal wave (literally) of fun for the whole family.  Catch it on the big screen while you can; buy it on DVD when you get the chance.  Trust me; you won't want to miss this one!

Note: The above review was written about the theater release; for the DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flushed-Away-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M343BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition)</a>, I'll just add the following: it's a good thing the movie is as great as I remembered it because the rest of the DVD was a little disappointing.  A couple of unskippable previews that have to fast-forwarded past, a couple more selectable from the main menu, a couple of animated singing slug music videos, a couple of ""making of"" featurettes, a couple of ""how to"" featurettes, a couple of video jukeboxes, one directors' commentary track, and a really lame DVD game is about it until you pop the disk in your computer, at which point you get a bunch of printables and 21 games of varying quality and playability.  The limited edition extra DVD available from some retailers adds little more: one new singing slug music video in addition to the two duplicated on the main disk, a slug cam video of a live slug, and a couple of lame DVD games.  Popping this disk in the computer yields a downloadable virtual slug, some slug-tones for your cell phone (one wonders why they didn't add any belch-tones or fart-tones), more printables, and one more game.  Oh, well, perhaps that is all we can expect from a DVD whose blurb defiantly claims it to be ""one of the year's best-REVIEWED films"", emphasis added, instead of, say, one of the biggest box office films.",1164758400,5,5872,5.64472190692395

2723681,5,B000M343BC,"I've heard a lot of bad reviews about Flushed Away, so at first I was a bit hesitant to go see it. My friend and I happen to love these clamation movies, however, and we simply couldn't miss a movie with Hugh Jackman in it stupid or not. We were very pleasently surprised. We simply adore this movie now. The jokes were cute, the characters unforgettable, and the story is engaging.

Roddy St. James(Hugh Jackman) is a high class pet living the high life in a flat in Kensington. He has all he could ever want, movies, golf, a car, a golden cage, and all the food you can eat. Unfortunetely, he has no one to share it with, save for the boring toy dolls his owner has. One night a pipe bursts in the kitchen and up comes Sid(Shane Richie), a sewer rat with horrible manners and a pushy attitude. As soon as he sees all the perks to living in a place like Kensington, he immediately makes himself at home and doesn't plan to leave anytime soon. Roddy is quickly annoyed and plans to show his ""new friend"" to the flats' ""jacuzzi"". Sid isn't that stupid, however, and it's Roddy who gets flushed away to the sewer and into Ratropolis. He instantly wants to get out of this crazy place and back to his comfy home, but has no idea how to get back. This brings him to Rita(Kate Winslet) a scavenger who makes a living finding what she can in the sewers on her trusty boat, the Jammy Dodger. Unfortunetely, this also brings him to The Toad(Ian McKlellen) a wannabe mob boss who hates rodents, rats or otherwise, his two henchmen, Spike(Andy Serkis) and Whitey(Bill Nighy), and his cunning French cousin, Le Frog(Jean Reno). Caught in between all this Roddy must find the courage to survive in a whole new world and find his way back home.

This is a wonderful movie for any age. Believe me, my friend and I are 18 and we truly enjoyed it. Don't take all the bad reviews to heart and miss this. You'll regret it!",1163894400,,1904,4.3605633802816905
2723682,4,B000M343BC,"Roddy (Jackman) is a pet rat who slips out of his cage when his family goes on vacation.  He is enjoying himself until Sid (Richie) arrives.  Sid is a sewer rat who just wants to watch the World Cup undisturbed, so he flushes Roddy down the toilet.  On the other side, Roddy finds himself in a town of sewer rats.  After meeting Rita (Winslet), he makes a deal with her to get himself home.  The one thing in their way is Boss Toad (McKellan), who is out to stop them and destroy the sewer rat's world.

For ""Flushed Away"", Aardman Studios have gone the route of computer animation instead of their usual stop-motion processes that work so well in ""Wallace and Gromit"".  This was to compensate for the high amount of water involved, an element that is difficult for stop-motion photography.  Fortunately, they kept the look of their clay characters, and the resulting product is almost indistinguishable from the look that they are used to.  The voice talent is top notch all around as well.  The humor is there, for both children and adults.  While not reaching the quality of this year's ""Cars"" and ""Monster House"", ""Flushed Away"" is an enjoyable film that is for the whole family.  It is definitely worth checking out.",1163635200,2,1221,4.654205607476635
2723683,4,B000M343BC,"Perhaps that's because it's from Aardman Studios, famous for ""Wallace And Gromit"" and ""Chicken Run.""  Aardman is also well known for their claymation style of animation, which is lovingly preserved, albeit through the use of CGI in ""Flushed Away.""

The story revolves around Roddy (Hugh Jackman), a family pet who gets flushed into the sewers of London by an unwelcome guest named Sid (Shane Richie).  Sid takes over the world ""up there"" while Roddy is left to fight for his life in the seedy underbelly of London's sewers.  In all actuality, though, life in the sewers isn't too terribly bad.  When Roddy arrives there, he finds a near replica of London full of busy streets and shops.  He decides that he must get home, and seeks out the aid of Rita (Kate Winslet), a female rat who's known for shady dealings.  On her tail (pun intended) are the goons of The Toad (Sir Ian McKellan), who says that a ruby he owned which fell from the crown of either Prince Charles or the Queen (I don't remember which) was stolen by her and he wants it back.  Of course Roddy thinks that by assisting him in finding the ruby, he'll get help in return to get back home.  What he gets instead is more trouble when Rita steals something else from The Toad.

From there, the story becomes a pretty decent action/comic yarn where The Toad's cousin, Le Frog (Jean Reno) and his henchmen try to retrieve the item that Rita has stolen.  It's an integral part of a master plan for revenge by The Toad on all of rodent-kind.  Along the way, Roddy and Rita become close friends and Roddy decides that he has to help Rita and her family.  It's all tied nicely together in the end and is definitely fun to watch.

The voice talents are wonderful.  Jackman, Winslet, McKellan and Reno all do wonderful jobs.  Andy Serkis, who portrayed Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings"" and did a lot of the physical movements of Kong in Peter Jackson's ""King Kong,"" plays one of The Toad's henchmen along with Bill Nighy, recent of the latest ""Pirate's of the Caribbean"" flick.

The humor is, as expected, well grounded in British comedy and uses slapstick at will to enduce laughter from children.  There are plenty of crotch injuries, one fart joke, and a few pokes at stereotypical Americans and the French.  It's all done with good intentions and there's nothing really offensive here.

It will hold the attention of both young and old, but children will probably enjoy it more than adults.  I enjoyed it but I have a tendency to enjoy silly children's flicks like this.  I'm also a fan of Aardman's other work, so perhaps I'm a little biased.  Rest assured that whenever it leaves the theaters and eventually hits the DVD rack, I'll be one of the first to buy it for myself and my family.",1163376000,59,2746,4.559183673469388
