7575633,5,B019GY79LS,"Barbie films are always entertaining for my granddaughter, 7. She is an ardent fan of PBS and all I their series if films. A Barbie film came with a Barbie doll, and she enjoyed it a great deal. She has a wonderful agitation, and all if her Barbie dolls end up as bath toys. They go swimming, and on ocean liners, and generally have fun at bath time.

In this film Barbie and her friends are gymnasts, and they become spies after a real spy recognizes their talents. With their high tech tools, toys and equipment, they are off to save the day from gem stealing criminals. This is a very cute film.

Barbie films feature some intelligent friends and ones that don't do as well, but they all have a lesson to them. I enjoy watching with my granddaughter, a good cuddling and bonding time.

It really helped their imagination. They also constantly pretend to practice gymnastics and want to go to the playground so they can ""work on their moves.""

7575714,4,B019GY79LS,"The movie is cute and delivers a good message as always. The reason for a four star instead of five is simply because they changed Barbie's voice. She is usually voiced by Kelly Sheridan and in this movie she's voiced by Erica Lindbeck. While this isn't something a 5 year old would notice, I am writing this from my perspective as a 30 year old.

This time it isn't a princess one but one about gymnastics and being recruited to become part of a secret spy agency.

7575764,5,B019GY79LS,"FINALLY! A Barbie movie I don't cring while my daughters watch! Barbie actually uses skill and science to save the day instead of magic and luck. There is no disrespectfulness to adults or making them look like morons. Who ever wrote this movie should get a bonus because this is actually what Barbie Corporation is trying to tell us is the reason they sell the doll, so that girls would imagine and think they can be anything. Every other Barbie movie I've ever seen is magic dust and hair spray. Only message those send out is be pretty and you'll get a Gary godmother to make it all work out. This movie shows her and her friends actually having to develope skill and work hard.
(spoiler alert) The only complaint I have about this movie is that the bad guy ends up being the only adult male in the movie and the bad teen gets away with a slap on the wrist. She has a change of heart last minute and helps catch the ""real"" bad guy, so that makes it ok, right?? (Sigh, you can't have it all I guess)",1457740800,4,1001,4.2460732984293195

7575772,5,B019GY79LS,"Charlie's Angels meets Barbie! It's a very fun, colorful movie that really does show the true meaning of teamwork and girl power. ""Spy Squad"" is familiar if you're a fan of the old-school spy shows, and if you've seen movies like ""Ultraviolet"" with use of ""dimension compressing technology"", and even Star Wars with the G.L.I.S., a glowing, expandable launching stick that could be summoned back to Barbie, much like the light saber of the Star Wars saga. You'll find easter eggs reminiscent of past Barbie films hidden throughout the movie. I think the film is a great way to encourage girls that they can use their brains and their bodies for much more than just beauty and vanity.",1457395200,3,683,4.796610169491525

7575788,5,B019GY79LS,"I'm been watching Barbie ever since I was a little girl. (I'm 18 now) The classic Barbie movies will always be my favorites and have the most sentimental value but I still enjoy watching the new ones when I can. This one is by far my favorite since the Fairytopia ones and thoses go way back! The new ones are good, but they attempt to be more modern and simple which is unnecessary for Barbie. As a young girl, I was able to follow along the storyline of a princess and a pauper wishing for freedom from their unfortunatd duties to a family of 12 dancing sisters who go on a magical journey of a lifetime. My point is, children are smarter then we may think and don't need simple corny writing. Barbie did a great job with this movie by having a storyline simple enough for kids but elaborate and detailed enough for adults to enjoy as well. That is why I still watch the movies! They caught my attention then and they still have it now! What I liked most about this movie, is that there are multiple nods to others Barbie movies as well as detail. The dress up scene had a lot of dresses that I recognized from the other newer Barbie movies which gave the movie sentiment. Also, I loved how the love interest was between the inventor (Lazlo) and Barbie' s friend (Teresa). It's nice to see that not every guy in a Barbie movie falls for Barbie. This gave Barbie and her friends a lot of personality. Lastly, I love the spy animation with the action and gadgets. I miss the old Barbie look, but I could learn to love this new animation. Girls of any age could come to love this movie. It has great morals of teamwork, see it and be it, and following your dreams.  I'm hoping for a Spy Squad 2!",1456790400,22,1694,4.260869565217392

8745149,5,B019GY79LS,We love the newer Barbie movies narrated by Erica Lindbeck and this one is no exception. I love how Barbie has changed gears to empower young girls more than princesses and frills. These are feminine while also showing that girls can have brains and athleticism. We had to get the motorcycle and car burglar to accompany this movie. And it is nice because my husband and I don't mind watching with out daughter. Hours of fun!,1509926400,,425,4.605263157894737

8745151,1,B019GY79LS,"This is my least favorite because of the lack luster story line, poor character development and ""different"" facial animations there were just....off.  Some characters were thrown in just because they were Barbie characters.  Poor introduction and development on other characters.  Silly scenes were added just for the sake of being silly and not adding to the story, like the chef scene?  That was stupid.  You CAN have silly scenes that add to the story line.  If these girls are supposed to be spies they'd know how to ""blend"" in and be prepared to do their job.  And they'd be intelligent.  They were chosen to be spies because of gymnastic ability but it was short on academic development.  Not spy worthy.

Where are you Rob Hudnut?

It does have the good things that most Barbie movies have.

Strong female characters, over coming doubt, making a change and doing the right thing, perseverance, a touch of romance and pets.",1505433600,,929,4.8471337579617835
