While it presents many challenging positions to biblical thought it can easily be explained as a manifestation from the fallen one Lucifer....Fallen Angels or Demons as some call them can use people to submit world views that lead away from biblical truth and conclusions, many we are told from scripture will fall for this misguided manisfestation....READ YOUR BIBLE FOR CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE.....Here is a free video that addresses the topic for free to those who truly want to learn what is taking place here.........[...]",1456531200,,607,5.141414141414141
7834151,5,6302999391,"No, this ""VHS"" tape does NOT show film footage of flying saucers, like i was hoping, but then turned out to be something 1000's of times greater.
You must see this video before anything else, but ONLY to the sincere God seekers, actually....you may become one after seeing this tape. It's worth buying a $50 VHS player just to view it!

7834152,5,6302999391,"If you're a loner creep like me you have simply got to pick this one up.  Even though I don't own a vcr I bought a vhs copy, just in case.  I've seen very many videos on UFOs and paranormal stuff, but this one takes the cake for me.  Great soundtrack (Deep Breakfast by Ray Lynch) throughout the vid which sets the mood almost too scary-perfectly.  All the greats are in this; Bashar, Lazaris, Seth, as well as a Brazilian man who channels the spirits of long-ago dead painters and can paint in that mode with his toes in the dark, turn on the lights 5 minutes later and it's an absolutely perfect painting in typical Van Gogh-style, etc.  There's no way you'll believe me until seeing this though, but that painter in this vid is worth the purchase alone.  This video takes first place for me, Jaime Maussan's lectures get second place, and then Sightings: the Ghost Report deserves well the 3rd place spot.  All very highly recommended.",1218153600,2,938,4.514792899408284
7834153,5,6302999391,"Hosted by Telly Savalas this video is an excellent introduction to the topics of extraterrestrials and channeling. The viewer will see interviews with various channels, explaining how they became involved in the practice, and hear each of them channeling for a few minutes. Some of the better known channels include Bashar, Lazaris, and a brief Seth audio excerpt. Especially fascinating are the scenes of Brazilian artist Gasparato, who can channel some forty different famous artists from the past. Watching him paint with  his eyes closed, even holding the brushes with his feet, and then seeing the eerie resemblance to the works Van Gogh, Monet, Modigliani, and others is an awesome experience. Why slow is some sections, the production overall is quite an achievement and well worth purchasing.
