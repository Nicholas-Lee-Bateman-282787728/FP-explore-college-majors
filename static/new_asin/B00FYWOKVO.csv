8619598,5,B00FYWOKVO,"Matteo Scuro: a widow and lonely man. He has five sons who line in the continents but who never, never have worried by visiting him; so he decides to see every one of them: Naples, Roma, Florence, Milan and Turin.

Along the trip goes by, one notices how his dreams about the projects of his sons are far from being true. Every date is a dissapointment but his indomitable soul and profound devotion he keeps for them is what ignites his desire for living 8Although this trip means for him his Farewell).

Despite the fact that three and half decades have elapsed since the Italian Neo Realism, Tornatore was capable to
reconstruct the germinal essence of this characteristically Italian expression, thanks -among other virtues- to his poetic vision and innate genius. He manages to recreate the inner tragedy of forgotten and neglected father for a new generation, absolutely indifferent, unable to feel the minimum affection or gratitude to his father who refuses to accept the world is as it is cool and distant cold and bleak.

The film will capture your interest due the fierce spirit of a man who despite of being in the treshold of his life, decides to act without regarding the consequences of his decision. A brave and original script; another notable evidence that carves in relief the coined statement by Jean Luc Godard, one of the most remarkable exponents of the French New Wave and I cite. ""The cinema is the expression of the beautiful feelings.""

It comes to my mind a marvelous affirmation given by Paul Diel: ""The art is the mirror of life but just for all those who are capable to get excited.""

Useless to say we are before the great Marcello giving us another of his most unforgettable peformances ever.",1483228800,,1725,4.7558528428093645
8619599,5,B00FYWOKVO,"This is, possibly, one of the most tragically beautiful films of all time. You can feel the Father's, hope, joy and pain throughout the whole film. And then the ending when he's at his wife's grave, heartbreaking yet beautiful.",1459382400,2,227,4.846153846153846
8619600,5,B00FYWOKVO,"This such a great film by one of the great directors - the director of Cinema Paradiso. Only recently available through some Korean company which, I'm afraid shows in the subtitle translations which are rarely correct but I still love owning this film, full of magic story-telling, vivid cinematography and surprise narrative twists at every turn.",1412121600,2,347,5.214285714285714
8619601,3,B00FYWOKVO,This is one of my favourite films and it should have a 5 star rating but unfortunately the English subtitles were done so badly that it took away from the pleasure of watching it again after all these years. Spelling mistakes and mixing up periods(full-stops) with commas were really too many to forgive. Strange that they went to the trouble of re-issuing this great film on DVD but couldn't bother to find an English speaker to go over the subtitles to check for mistakes. I would have done it for free!,1410307200,5,505,4.56043956043956
8619602,5,B00FYWOKVO,This is the original film that the Robert de Niro version(every body's fine) doesn't even come close to duplicating.  Marcello Mastroiani is excellent as the grandfather who travels to see his adult children who have their own lives and secrets.  A poignant and unforgettable Italian movie.  Glad I could finally get it in DVD that is compatible with US machines.,1400630400,4,363,5.016666666666667

8619604,5,B00FYWOKVO,"Good movie, good story. It has a little of everything. The father has a higher expectations form his childlren. They are not what he likes to thing of them. Excelent story.",1390348800,,172,4.580645161290323
8619605,5,B00FYWOKVO,"One of the greatest Italian films ever made, and one of the greatest films, period. A truly profound film about family love, deception, and self-deception. But rather than write a detailed review, please note that this DVD, which cost me $36.96 (includes postage) from seller Aspireforward on Amazon, is available, and also brand-new, on eBay from seller Panjafe. The Panjafe one comes out of South Korea, but it is the identical disc, right down to disc and picture quality, art work, and the combo of Korean and English on the box. The Panjafe disc cost me a total of $17.49 (also includes postage). So you can buy two for the price of one from Panjafe. Just go to eBay and search for ""Everybody's Fine,"" 1990. Also note that this film bears little resemblance to the cheesey DeNiro version that came out a couple of years ago. This one (1990) stars the great Marcello Maistroianni. Both of the discs of the Mastroianni film mentioned above of course have the same fine and clear English subtitles, probably the ones from the VHS tape that came out in 1990. Please get the film. It's great! I've loved it for the last couple of decades or more.
  At the moment Amazon is apparently using ""Famousfilms"" as its source, but the inflated price seems the same when you add the postage.
  But the main thing is to see this fabulous film as soon as you can.",1386115200,12,1352,4.597510373443983
