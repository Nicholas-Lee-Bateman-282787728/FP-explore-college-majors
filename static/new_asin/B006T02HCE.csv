8503849,4,B006T02HCE,"I saw some of this series while in a waiting room and had to ask where they had gotten it. I then went on-line with Amazon and ordered my own set.  These are great. Hundreds of cable channels and at times, nothing to watch - until now. These can run in the background with or without the sound and when relaxing, the video-scapes just draw you in to the unique and beautiful camera views and scenes. A nice alternative to have available.",1383004800,,437,4.329268292682927
8503850,5,B006T02HCE,"This DVD set is a breathtaking, I guarantee you will find at least a dozen moments of wonder. The visuals and soundtracks are beautiful.
Its like Planet Earth without the dialogue.",1366243200,,180,4.838709677419355
8503851,3,B006T02HCE,Foolish impulse purchase. The videos are cool to watch once then they just get dull. This is a product that is best when not paid for.,1345507200,2,134,4.1923076923076925
