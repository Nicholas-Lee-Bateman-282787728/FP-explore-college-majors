8376060,5,B002OKL1BQ,"I'm an old guy:  55 and I have artificial hips.  However, I still compete a lot in BJJ.  My coaches recommended deep half as something that might work for me, and they showed me a little.  After beginning to study Jeff Glover's DVD, I have incorporated deep half into my game.  It's working great for me, and a lot of the younger guys at the dojo are trying to pick up the techniques as well.  But I'm not sharing my DVDs.  I need some kind of edge against them.  That's the wisdom of age!",1415923200,6,489,4.127659574468085
8376061,5,B002OKL1BQ,In this video you will find half guard techniques that you will not learn at your academy or in any You Tube videos.  In all fairness there are some low percentage moves in the video but I did learn a few moves that are now my bread and butter moves from half guard.  That in itself is worth its weight in gold.,1403395200,,311,4.0
8376062,5,B002OKL1BQ,Best bjj dvd available right now i bought a bunch and this one stands out by far as the most complete,1381190400,,101,3.857142857142857
8376063,5,B002OKL1BQ,Really fantastic series of videos. I have been working my half guard for about 6 months. It really jumped after I starting watching this series.,1353628800,,144,4.8
8376064,5,B002OKL1BQ,"My husband has watched this video for hours. He loves to try new things on his work out partners.  These moves are on the complex side, but it is always interesting to see new moves or even old moves approached in a new way.  It was definitely worth the money.",1297382400,,260,4.18
8376065,5,B002OKL1BQ,"The entries into deep half guard make this instructional worth the $$$ alone. The sweeps are very simple and effective, which made it easy for me to understand and apply. There are useful entries from being mounted, escaping back control (my favorite), and several others. This dvd is entertaining as well, which includes several joke scenes between techniques to keep it from getting boring like many BJJ DVDs do. 5 stars for this one and the favorite in my collection (yes, even over the ryan hall deep half dvd)",1294185600,8,514,4.786516853932584
8376066,4,B002OKL1BQ,"I didn't even know this was a position, much less that you attack from it too. The swiss ball exercises are pretty entertaining. If you are a know it all MMA blogger, you probably won't like it. However, if your cup is empty you could gain something from this DVD.",1265068800,,264,4.3
