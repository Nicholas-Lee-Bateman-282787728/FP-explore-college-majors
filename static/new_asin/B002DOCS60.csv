3912287,4,B002DOCS60,"I got this for my kids,they are 8 and 4. My 8 year old was a little iffy on it at first but once she tried one of the workouts, she was ready to do them all. My 4 year old wasn't really into it. But overall I found it to be a good buy and its something fun for them to do indoors, since its far too cold for them to play outside.",1324166400,,329,3.4594594594594597
3912288,5,B002DOCS60,"When my kids (8 and 11) are being over active, I pop the Fit Factor Kids DVD in and get them moving in a healthy direction... they love it. I (mom) even do it with them sometimes.",1250035200,,179,3.864864864864865
3912289,5,B002DOCS60,"I have three kids (14yrs, 12yr, 11yrs) and they all love the video workout.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has kids or has family members with kids. I will buy a few as stocking stuffers for Christmas.",1248652800,5,212,4.3
3912290,5,B002DOCS60,"Finally...something productive for the kids to do!  My four year old loves doing the ""work-outs"" (although she doesn't know she's actually working out).  My twelve year old even does it with her for fun!  It's nice for them to be able to do something active indoors with our unbearably hot weather.  I am also an Elementary School teacher and plan to take it to school for rainy days or when my students need a little movement.  I'm anticipating it being very useful to keep students with ADHD focused and on task.",1248652800,6,514,4.604395604395604
3912291,5,B002DOCS60,"I bought this to use at home on rainy days - sometimes kids just need to burn off some energy. The workouts were great...not too long (which helps keep a little kid's attention), but long enough to work up a sweat. And my son thinks the hosts are really cool.

We liked it so much that I bought a copy to give my son's Pre-K teacher. She says the kids in his class really like the fun themes and music.",1248048000,3,402,4.025
3912292,4,B002DOCS60,"I bought this to give my kids something to do other than sit and watch tv all summer.  I have a five and nine year old.  At first they did not want to do it, but agreed to after I told them I would join in.  The workouts were easy to follow and with good descriptions. There are six workouts to choose from. Two of them are geared towards younger kids but my nine year old enjoyed them too.  Overall I would give it four out of five stars.  Why not five?  I never give anything a five star rating!",1247443200,,497,3.92
8365663,5,B002DOCS60,My 7 year old daughter kept asking to do my workouts but they were too difficult for her. This has been great! She loves that they are fun but still actual workouts. This was a great purchase!,1442188800,,192,4.216216216216216

8365665,4,B002DOCS60,we used this for kids ranging from 3-7 and it engaged them all.  Great for indoor energy release and fun.,1422662400,,105,4.25
8365666,4,B002DOCS60,Great DVD for getting bored kids up and moving.,1419897600,,47,4.333333333333333
8365667,1,B002DOCS60,This DVD says it's for kids ages 4-12......well my 10 & 11 year old homeschooled sons hated it.  I would say it might be good for ages 4-7 at most.  Not very good as a fitness/PE resource.,1396224000,,188,4.054054054054054
8365668,5,B002DOCS60,We bought this video to do before homeschooling everyday to get them up & moving and ready to start the day. When I first turned it on my boys (4 and 6) were horrified that I was making them do an exercise video but they had so much fun! (My 21 month old had a blast too!) They now look forward to it every morning. I LOVE how there are 6 different short segments that hold their attention. They videos have fun health tips that have helped them further see the importance of healthy food choices. I would recommend this to anyone with young kids ages 1 - 9 (I think older may think it's too cheesy),1389139200,,599,4.128205128205129
8365669,5,B002DOCS60,"Exercises are engaging, and led by kids!  My students love this DVD.  A great 5 to 10 minute time filler, that encourages a healthy lifestyle.",1368921600,,142,4.64
8365670,2,B002DOCS60,"I want to love this DVD, I don't have  a problem with it but as it was purchased for my 4yrs old niece & she's bored after watching it a few (very few) times....maybe it's just not for her, she loves to dance & she loves music but it doesn't keep her entertained.  If it were returnable I'd say try it and see if your little one(s) like it but for the price...",1354147200,,360,3.9178082191780823
8365671,5,B002DOCS60,We use for our YMCA After School care program to keep the kids moving.  They love it!  Something for all ages.,1328140800,2,110,4.190476190476191
8365672,5,B002DOCS60,"Although we try to watch what our children eat, we noticed that our 9-year-old was starting to put on weight -- a combination of being short for her age and not being very active.  In order to help promote a healthy lifestyle, we decided to encourage her to be more active.  This DVD has been a great way to do that, since she uses it several times a week.

It consists of 6 different workouts, each about 5 minutes. She usually chooses four of the workouts for one session.  She likes both the girl and the boy who lead the different sessions; they do a good job of keeping her interest. They take children through a variety of different moves based on themes.  The moves are fun for her and not too difficult to keep up with, even though she is a little on the uncoordinated side.

Bonus: our 4-year-old daughter loves to ""work out"" along with her big sister. The first two sessions consist of simpler movements and are perfect for her.  She can't do all of the moves on the last four sessions, but she loves trying.  She also loves the health tips that the kids share throughout the DVD.

A great purchase that we are really happy with.  My only complaint is that there is no ""Play All"" button on the menu, so you have to select each workout individually.",1327363200,14,1258,4.360515021459228
