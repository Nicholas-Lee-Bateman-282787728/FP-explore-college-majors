8148364,3,B000J10HBW,"This essentially is a basic representation of Zakk's style.  For the most part it is generalized lead playing and a few rhythm chops.  This is good for the player who wants to graze some metal style and learn a few chops when Zakk played with Ozzy.  However, if you are heavily into Zakk and have a gist of metal playing, then I would get something a bit more defined and somewhat more complex.",1281225600,,394,4.36986301369863

Also a part for beginners w intro to minor pentatonic and blues scales.. Parts on country and southern rock approach and licks also very nice, gives u a raw foundation for further approach..",1215043200,2,339,4.230769230769231
