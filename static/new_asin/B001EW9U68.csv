8299625,5,B001EW9U68,"""Amir Naderi is perhaps the best unknown filmmaker in the world.""
Washington Post January 25, 1991
The above was written when Naderi's ""The Runner"" ""DAVANDEH"" was being shown in DC, few years before ""Manhattan By Numbers."" Now, I am so glad to see Naderi's first American movie finally out on DVD. This is a ""Manhattan"" you have never seen before even if you have lived in Manhattan for a long time.

In ""Manhattan By Numbers"" Naderi is still running. He will not stop until he makes his American Masterpiece. His latest American film ""Vegas"" (2008) is a good example that he is getting there!

""Amir Naderi ,(born 15 August, 1946 in Abadan, Iran) is a notable Iranian film director, screenwriter and one of the most influential figures of 20th-century Persian cinema.

Naderi developed his knowledge of cinema by watching films at the theater where he worked as a boy, reading film criticism, and making relationships with leading film critics. He began his career with still photography for some notable Iranian features. In the 1970s, Naderi turned to directing, and made some of the most important features of the New Iranian Cinema. In 1971, his directorial debut, Goodbye Friend was released in Iran. Mr. Naderi first came into the international spotlight with films that are now known as cinema classics, The Runner (1985), and Water, Wind, Dust (1989). The Runner is considered by many critics to be one of the most influential films of the past quarter century. After a number of his films were banned by the Iranian government, Mr. Naderi left the country. Expatriating to New York, Mr. Naderi continued to produce new work. He was named a Rockefeller Film and Video fellow in 1997, and has served as an artist in residence and instructor at Columbia University, the University of Las Vegas, and New York's School of Visual Arts. His U.S. films have premiered at the Film Society of Lincoln Center/MOMA's New Films New Director's series, the Venice, Cannes, Sundance and Tribeca Film Festivals. His ""Sound Barrier"" (2005) won the prestigious Roberto Rossellini Prize at the Rome Film Festival.""",1228089600,2,2104,4.988603988603988
