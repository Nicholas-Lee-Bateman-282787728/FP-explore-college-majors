8034999,5,B00004Y7HE,This is my all time favorite Christmas DVD. I bought it when it first came out on video and then again on DVD. I play it all through the entire Christmas season. It has beautiful Christmas trees... teddy bears... angels... nativities...sparkling lights... gorgeous fireplaces... and WONDERFUL SNOWSCENES (I don't know what the other reviewer was thinking!) I especially like how the director edited the music perfectly with the beautiful scenes. I like the upbeat instrumental versions of the Christmas Carols too. My family's holiday season wouldn't be the same without it. It's our favorite!,1154822400,,593,5.319148936170213
8035000,4,B00004Y7HE,"I enjoyed this DVD very much. The photography was excellent.....very well done! The more serious photography as well as that of the ""sparkle"" and ""tinsel"" was appropriately intertwined with the music, creating the ""gist"" of each of the Holiday songs.  Even though I prefer the more traditional renditions of most Christmas Carols, I found these arrangements to be to my liking.  The songs were fresh and uplifting and well played.  This DVD definitely put me in a ""Holiday"" mood.  I highly recommend it!",1069718400,2,503,5.024096385542169
