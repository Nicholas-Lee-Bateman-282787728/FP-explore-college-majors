7414004,4,B014KEP8XK,"Kirara Asuka returns in this second installment of Iron Girl. Still looking for answers to her real identity and lost memories, she currently works as a bounty hunter and lives as a member of a community trying to survive at the edges of the wastelands. We do learn in the prologue that a global nuclear war in 2042 was responsible for the breakdown of society and the story takes place decades after that. Iron Girl takes on the evil Sparti Group, originally a corporate security outfit but now acting as a bandit gang. Interesting foes such as Lady Poison and the Kill android/cyborg. We also learn that Chris (Iron Girl) was a member of the defense forces before their dissolution and her memory loss. Her armor and powers are slightly upgraded for this sequel- such as the ability to draw a bladed weapon from a quantum field and now has the ability to have her armor encase her at will (think Extremis from the iron man series). Action at beginning and end with plenty of character drama in between. The ending is semi-climatic with third film clearly in mind. Looking forward to post-apocalyptic Tokyo and her adventures (and memories) in Iron Girl 3.",1449792000,8,1157,4.704433497536946

8731112,2,B014KEP8XK,"IRON GIRL II is a sore disappointment to me. The ad copy made me think it would be a another post-apocalyptic Mad Max with a female Max. Instead it turns out to be a female IRON MAN which is a live-action cartoon with Robert Downy Jr (whom I usually like -- except as Iron Man and Sherlock). The heroine, Chris, is mean-spirited woman who even bites the male organ of a man who is trying to help her. In fact, she bites it twice, the second time after he has saved her life. Go figure. Maybe someone should have bitten one of her beautiful breasts. She has a gorgeous, voluptuous body which she doesn't mind showing off, even to her enemies before she touches a mark of her shoulder and is suddenly encased in futuristic weapon-equipped but sexy body armor. It is then that the movie becomes a fantasy and heads downhill. There is also a dufus clown character that follows her around and tries to help her. Maybe this type of idiot character is amusing to the Japanese who seem to be such austere, conservation, and quiet people but not to these Western eyes.

I watched this film before watching IRON GIRL Part 1, but not out of choice. I ordered the first IRON GIRL August 22 and still had not received by September 22, even though it was promised on that date. Another disappointment. It is still not available as of this date, and I was warned that it may be a long wait. I finally went ahead and watched IRON GIRL II.  Only then did I realize that I need not worry about the long wait for the original.

Too bad. It seems that this could have been much more than merely another cartoon fantasy like those put out by Marvel.  A newspaper article mentioned that American audiences no longer like something original on the screen and seemed to prefer the dumbed-down efforts that are being produced. If so, IRON GIRL II should be enough for them.",1474675200,2,1848,4.426470588235294

8731114,2,B014KEP8XK,Not much action in this movie but the storyline leaves room for a follow up movie.  This sequel should have been put together with the first one of the same name.  The lack of action and weak story line make me feel like I wasted money and time.  Let me some up the movie.  A girl with a custom battle suit does not remember who she was or how she got the suit.  I don't recommend buying it as I did.,1461024000,3,400,3.888888888888889

8731117,5,B014KEP8XK,"This movie is so much better than the original Iron Girl. Better story, more action, more nudity, more fun! It feels like the budget got tripled and the director steering the ship actually cared about making an idea into a grind house style franchise.  The Movie sets you up for a third installment and I am looking forward to it.  If the original Iron Girl was not your cup of tea for the first round, this makes up for it. And if you have never seen the first Iron Girl, this Movie retcons most of what the first film was, as it feels like it never happened & Iron Girl is the only character that carries over & no backstory is required.  This film seems to only be on DVD & not BD right now, but I highly recommend the DVD and even watching the ""making of"" feature when you receive it!  Highly recommended for Japanese exploitation fans!",1451779200,13,840,4.2974683544303796
