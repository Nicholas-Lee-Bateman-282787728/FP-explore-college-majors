Michael St. Gerard perfectly captures the role of a disturbed and mentally challanged man. This movie is also much more artful than most horror movies.  There is very little blood and gore so it is not overpowering and does not take away from the meaning behind the acts in the movie. Some may think Henry was just a psycho with an axe, but there is more to the story than what you typically get with the run-of-the-mill horror movie.  Is Mr. Bones really just a figament of Henry's imagination helping him live out a twisted desire to kill, or is he the devil bending the will of a mentally challanged man to achieve evil goals?  A true must see for people who want to think about a movie, not just vegitate for two hours.",1110412800,,880,4.245508982035928
8283283,5,6304267045,"before DVDs ruled the world, this title kept nagging me from its spot in the ""horror"" section of my local blockbuster. feeling in the mood for some cheap gore one day, i picked it up. not finding a spare moment that day, i finally watched it late on the evening before it was due. i cannot remember a film before that having effected my so much, or being so haunted by a circumstance in a movie. henry, a lonely man dispairing over his social worker's vacation, attempts to jump off a building when he is apprehended by a man named sam bones, extolling the needs of his (henry's) audience. they need you, he tells henry, to entertain them. at sam's bidding, henry goes on a killing spree. things go great until wendy, the social worker, comes back. so horrific and deeply effecting, and leaves such a lasting impression. if you've seen darren aronofsky's ""requiem for a dream"" and you thought THAT was devastating, you have no idea. recommended to the highest degree, seek this one out!",1100995200,3,986,4.607954545454546
8283284,4,6304267045,"A moody, dark psychological thriller.  Beautiful camera angles and scenes throughout. A quirky story - a sort of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" gone terribly wrong...  I watched this on a recommendation from a friend and was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it was.",1024876800,,262,4.931818181818182
