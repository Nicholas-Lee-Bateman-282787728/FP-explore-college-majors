As the reviewer before me said, the dvd case is not very sturdy and I would hope if this is re-released that they'd opt to get a better case. Also, posture is not explained at all. They just get right to business which leads me to believe I probably won't be actually using this dvd to work out quite yet. However it looks very fun and I'm excited to do it. Another issue is that the camera angles don't always show you what you need to see to make sure you're executing the movements properly. It's very difficult if you have no dancing experience and even with to do the Monkey see-Monkey do approach if you can't see to begin with. Most of the moves are visible enough but sometimes it's just irritating to try and see what Amy is doing so you can copy it too. Minor problems, but overall I am liking what I see :)",1377648000,,947,4.208791208791209
8380351,4,B002TO9P5G,"I bought this DVD at Hot Pot when it was first made as a supplement to classes and am very happy with it. On the disc there is a workout that's well over an hour long,an interview with Amy, an UNMATA performance and video of the troupe just hanging out with Suhaila.

The workout itself is pretty much exactly how she teaches her fusion classes, drilling isolations and combos and working them into a short choreography. The workout was moderately paced so I wasn't dying by the end but definitely challenging enough to hold my interest. This is a fusion DVD, not straight bellydance, but it's fun and good for dance conditioning.

The extras I found interesting and entertaining but they might not be to everyone's tastes.

The nitpicks I have with it were pretty minor but here they are: the dvd case is made of cardboard, so it's not the most durable. In the middle of the workout section there's suddenly a chunk of footage from the interview that I'm not sure was intentional.

There are two versions of the performance, one normal and a ""psychedelic"" one with visual effects and odd camera tricks which I found pretty distracting. I would much rather have had two different performances because UNMATA is a very creative and dynamic group and I don't think these clips show that as well as other performances.

In spite of the nitpicks I'm glad I bought it.",1324684800,,1363,4.639004149377594
