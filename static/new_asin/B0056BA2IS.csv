8459398,2,B0056BA2IS,"This was a disappointment for me due to the technical problems viewing some of the programs. The supplier has discontinued the sale of this product as far as I am aware, due to the difficulties of accessing some of the programs. I bought, however, the 2 disc set Masterpieces of the Hermitage, which is the very same program. It is in perfect condition and you can access all of the programs. It is also in Dolby Digital sound with very beautiful music. It is well worth owning for anyone interested in art and for someone who has an interest in having a video from one of the greatest museums in the world. The price is great for 9 hours of viewing.",1434585600,,650,4.380165289256198

8459401,5,B0056BA2IS,"This set is a superb and well-nigh comprehensive review of the immense collection of St. Petersburg's incomparable Hermitage Museum. For someone such as myself, who has never been to Russia and probably never will be, this set is the next best thing,  The photography is brilliant and beautiful, and the voice-over narration by a gentleman with a cultured English accent is very amenable and easy to listen to over and over.  The individual videos in the VHS set that I purchased are arranged according to period and school of painting or sculpture, so that one can progress chronologically and even geographically throughout the entire history of art.  A really superb achievement by the British production team responsible for its creation.",1368057600,4,742,5.166666666666667
