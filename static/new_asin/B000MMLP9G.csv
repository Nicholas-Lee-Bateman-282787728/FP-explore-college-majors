2737113,5,B000MMLP9G,"I really don't know where to start on this one, because it is just that amazing.

Firstly, the movie is incredibly beautiful, in a mind-blowing, visually stunning sort of way.  Everything is very detailed,
Secondly, the acting is impeccable.  All of the characters come to life and Masumi Miyazaki does such an insanely good job, I stand captivated long after multiple viewings...
Combined, you are sucked into the world these characters are living in, and sent into the big top of chaos.

Sion Sono, who you may, and most likely know from Suicide Club takes a whack at sexuality, and once again family.  Tossing away society, we take a very intimate look at the workings of attraction, jealousy, memories, and a hurricane of other emotions that spawn from love of any sort; in this case it is a distorted love.

About this DVD:
The packaging is very nice, haha... the apparently newly trendy clear box, with nice inserts.  The disk itself has the full version of Strange Circus, despite what the box says, this is, in fact the full TLA releasing of the movie, with the time as correct on Amazon.com.  Why it is incorrect on the box... I do not know.  There is also a great making of featurette, with English subtitles, that runs about an hour.

Though people say that this movie is highly disturbing and uncomfortable, etc. I didn't find it to be that bad.  Yes there are some more... off-putting scenes, but nothing I wouldn't feel comfortable watching with friends, and definitely nothing inappropriate given the story/goal of this film, that taken into perspective, it's actually quite tasteful, going so far as to let you in on what is happening, but not so far as to be exploiting anyone.  As I said, it is so well done, that you are completely taken along for the ride.  The music is dead on to bring you in too, and the visuals are surreal to ordinary, and everywhere in between, but even when ordinary, it is breath-taking in beauty.  Sion Sono again takes on a big task, and succeeds, in my opinion, and delivers something to take a look at and open your mind up to!

All around 5/5!  A must buy/watch for the Japanese Cinema fan, Sion Sono fan, or the open-minded viewer!!!",1219104000,24,2184,4.6337662337662335
2737114,4,B000MMLP9G,"This movie is like a wild trip thru the minds of a psychotic abused child and her self-victimized mother. Even though it gets a little slow towards the middle and a slight confusing at the very end, still overall: genius. The delivery was on-point along w/ the acting. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the disturbing child abuse. I'm not a fan of some visuals in the movie but I decided not to let my bias disturb the pure genius of the movie. I suggest anyone (over 18 of course lol) watch this.",1215648000,3,518,4.242424242424242
2737115,4,B000MMLP9G,"This is not a horror film by any means, but, the actions depicted were horriffic. Although subtitles often detract from the overall meaning conveyed in foreign film, this is not true for Strange Circus. This film is loaded with art, mystery, meaning, with just a hint of surrealism for good measure. Director Miyazaki effectively addresses the incest taboo with a forceful yet subtly sensitive hand. He does not imply wrong doing,or the emotional pain involved for the young incest victim, but rather illustrates it physically and directly. Bravo! Whether this film was the figment of a deranged writers imagination or the reality of a mother and daughter is left to the imagination of the viewer. A well balanced film along the lines of Ju On minus the horrorific special effects, I would recommend this film for lovers of Asian cinema. But then, when you are working with a good script who needs overt special effects?",1209859200,2,920,4.941935483870968

But I see no point to purchasing a film with a few minutes missing - much less 24-  a quarter of the film - and from the sound of the reviewer I learned this from this is perfectly acceptable because the missing parts offer more detail of the situation. ???

2737118,3,B000MMLP9G,"A nicely-designed film, mostly designed to shock. Prompted by Amazon to write this review, I realized that mostly I remember the real naughty/ shock stuff, but the plot? Guess I'll have to go back and re-view this strange circus, what it's about and what happens all evade me. Maybe that's a good thing; like, I can see it again for the first time.

(I liked SUICIDE CLUB but really disliked MOON CHILD; this falls in the middle, between salacious and silly and interesting in an odd way, I think. Maybe. I just dunno.)",1193875200,,519,4.580645161290323
2737119,4,B000MMLP9G,"Strange Circus is from the director of Suicide Club. Both films are controversial and very uninhibited with their theme.
Very bizarre, uninhibited, disturbingly wierd to its very core, this film doesn't leave much for the imagination, it pushes the envelope in the world of the macabre and the unusual. Actually, bizarre is an understatement. Decapitated limbs, incestuous lovemaking, and blood-soaked walls squeeze deep within the story's convoluted and utterly unnerving nature. It's the type of film that you want to look away from if it wasn't so intriguing.

A film that pushes the envelope this far has to be artistically captivating in its cinematography and immersive in execution to offset its exploitative premise and bypass its dark shadowy premise. The film delivers; with such lurid visual grandeur, dark twisted philosophy and a very strong and aggressive narrative style from director Sion Sono, it manages to rise above that label, but still maintain a feeling of gritty disgust which looms in its endless pit of the unusual. Buckle your seat belts and check your airbags, because all the odd and disturbing twists and turns within Strange Circus could disturb the viewer in a way that simulates whiplash.

As much as I would like to give you details of the screenplay, I'd rather have the ones who happen to rent/buy this title be taken on a ride. Suffice it to say, the film revolves around the decline of child named Mitsuko, and her mother Sayuri/Taeko the novelist. While this is a very grotesque tale of a love triangle, the good cinematography can preoccupy the viewer of this odd tale.

Masumi Miyazaki gives a great performance. She is quite gutsy to pull this off.  She manages to capture the aura of Sayuri's/Taeko's eroticism as well as her twisted presence.  She is quite a sight. The actress must have been hand-picked for this role. Sexy, alluring but with a disturbing aura about her; Miyasaki rivals Aya Sugimoto when it comes to raw twisted sexuality.

Strange Circus is an experience very much alike when you experience motion sickness. Viewers will feel like being grabbed by the spine and shaken until you pass out. For some reason, I managed to sit through the entire film because it gets you curious on how it will end. It has that effect much like when you see a car wreck, you want to look away but for unknown some reason you can't and your eyes are stuck.

Video/Audio: This TLA release video transfer is much like the Japanese region 3 release. The transfer is very sufficient to a film this type. It has some video noise but not bad. The 5.1 DD track is quite crisp. It delivers that loud creepy score.

I would like to warn you that this is not for the faint of heart. It is a journey into the unusual with a VERY shocking level of abnormality. People who liked Lynchian-type mind-benders may want to give it a shot. The film's premise is of such sensitive nature that only the MOST TIMID recommendation can be given.

2737123,2,B000MMLP9G,"Kimyo na Sasaku (Strange Circus) (Shion Sono, 2005)

I know some folks who think Shion Sono is a demigod incarnate, and who think he's one of the best filmmakers walking the planet today. I have never been one of them; he's made some very good movies over the years, but he's always been kind of hit-or-miss with me. I sat down with Sono's 2005 effort Strange Circus last night, and this one definitely falls on the miss side of the markin fact, I think it is my least favorite of the Sono pictures I have seen so far.

Plot: Taeko (A Watcher in the Attic's Masumi Miyazaki in, to date, her final screen appearance) is a novelist who has been struggling with her most recent creation, a story about a young girl named Mitsuko (The Great Yokai War's Mai Takahashi) whose family life is almost unspeakably traumatic. (I say almost because, obviously, Taeko is writing it.)  She suffers terrifying abuse at the hands of both parents, sexual from her father and physical and emotional from her mother. The first half hour of this film is a depiction of the events in the novel (without telling you that these events are from a novel), and it's pretty ugly stuff to watch. We then meet Yji (Samurai Zombie's Issei Ishida), Taeko's personal assistant, who is intrigued with the story and is trying discreetly to find out how much of it, if any, is based on Taeko's own life.

The main problem with the film is its climax. The movie has spent a good deal of time trying to get you to buy into the universe Sono, who also wrote, is pitching here. And as distasteful as the movie is, he almost (though not quite) succeeds in creating a coherent, internally consistent universe. And then, well, there's the climax, and all the bombs he drops that require you to stretch disbelief about a dozen times farther than you've already stretched it to buy what he's been selling you up until now. I have seen at least one article, in Sound on Sight, saying that people are criticizing movies for having twists (and specifically going off briefly on M. Night Shyamalan [linked in original article]). The problem is not that there is a twist. The problem is that the twist stretches the bounds of credulity in a movie that will already be difficult for users to stomach. Why add on unbelievability? **",1399852800,,2281,4.583333333333333
2737124,2,B000MMLP9G,"Because it is Strange!

I have seen too many Shion Sono films and have come to realize how redundant his movies are not to mention how terrible the endings always are. If you like gory bloody violence, gratuitous sex, abstract plots that deviate from reality, and unsatisfying endings that don't bother to explain the reasons for anything you just watch than you my friend will enjoy the films Shion Sono creates. Me on the other hand I'm tired of them and tired of getting burned at the end when I find out the ending is as pointless as the movie itself. Sure, show me violence, show me random sex, but show me a logical reason for it or at least try to have it make sense. For those that don't know are perhaps aren't familiar with Japanese culture Japanese or really Asian films in general usually have some hidden point in them that makes a statement about their countries economic standing,socialism,politics, government, cultural standpoints,societal views etc. etc. etc. There is usually one of these underlying statements in their movies most of the time. Shion Sono likes to take one of those themes and make the most abstract movies around them. Some people like to call it artistic, some like to call it a masterpiece but to other people that see between the lines we call it bull@%$#. These movies appeal to either people that like Gory films (that usually need no plot),people that like sexually perverse films (that like porno's also need no plot), or people that like to blend both of these two worlds into their movies natural born killer style. What's funny is that in the USA Shion Sono is more famous for his gory film Suicide Club. Especially when clips from it circulate over the internet. It's the shock of the gore that lures people into watching and it's what they come for. Not the story, not his message, not any of these. They come for the gore, and ironically that's what his films are renowned for being shocking and gory. Just like M. Night Shyamalan is known for his ""Plot Twist"" endings to the point where it's a pop culture joke now. Some ""homemade"" intellectuals will watch his films and say it's the best most sophisticated film they ever saw and ""you just don't get it"". While others who realize these films are just made by a man that enjoys making gory,violent, and explicative films with a hidden message inside them like a fortune cookie as means to justify the awkward films he creates. It be kind of like Wes Craven saying he made Freddy Krueger to illustrate the twisted mind of a child killer and not because he wanted to make a slasher movie with a good villain. I guess with Shion Sono's films it's like one of those ink blot test. Some see a pretty butterfly and others just see an inkblot. With this film all I see is an ink blot smeared on excuse to create a violently perverted film. I wouldn't go as far to call Shion Sono films ""pretentious"" that be more like an insult. He actually puts a lot of work and thought into his films and while strange they are still filmed and performed well but the way they are executed just is never to my taste.

Side note the acting is very good and the women look good too.",1379548800,,3160,4.532399299474606

There is no silly violence or goofy humor, just lustful adventures between father, mother, and daughter... and a cello case that likes to eat soba noodles.  That's a joke, the cello case is not a joke in the film, just an important part of the adventure.

2737126,5,B000MMLP9G,"WARNING: attempting to avoid any spoiler, but mild allusions and hints present

The movie starts of quite *hard*, but with a surreal element that fades as your believe Mitsuko's childhood has come to an end.  The horror of her upbringing--the emotional, sexual, and physical abuse she endured--that is horror.  Likewise for the wife, Sayuri.  The movie still keeps an element of surrealism all the way through, so that frankly, I couldn't spoil the ending if I tried.  I can't say without closer analysis what I believe the true ending was.  Sion spins enough threads in the story that there despite the horrific and disturbing feelings generated, afterwards, you can look at how much he's improved (imho) since Suicide Club (a great movie, but hard to piece together and make coherent in a single watching; multiple required).

I'd like to say I want to watch this over to look for those points where I could help figure out my opinion, but the movie was physically unsettling to watch.

All that said, Sion does a wonderful job of adding ""light"" music to things, and weaves an intricate story that compliments the ""horror"" elements.  I highly recommend it to any fan of psychological horror, and fans of Sion in general.",1363478400,2,1222,4.8647342995169085
2737127,5,B000MMLP9G,"This movie is great and plays mind games with the viewer until the end and they are very effective. I was thinking WTF is going but it all got cleared up for me in the end. The movie has taboo subject matter and deals with it in a way that I've never seen. Though there are many sexual scenes in the movie you don't see more nudity than a woman's breasts but it definitely not for the closed minded.

Gotta give this 5/5",1319587200,3,420,4.0602409638554215
2737128,4,B000MMLP9G,"What can I say?  Seriously?  It was surreal, confusing, and uncomfortable, all at the same time.  The implied sex between father and twelve-year-old daughter was excellently done, without actually indulging in a bit of pedophilia.  Using her mother as the representation of her was brilliant, and spared many of us the squick of underage incest.

The young man who plays Yuji was stunning.  He was effeminate without being over the top.  You could almost see the glint of psychosis in his eyes as he confronts his mother and father near the end of the movie.  Until then, he seemed almost normal, if a bit of a fanboy.  The psychological twists and turns, and the constant switching of perspective, kept me confused and dazed throughout the film.  I was never sure, even by the end of the movie, what the real story was.  Definitely kept me guessing.

Amazon.com's review of the movie has one thing wrong, however.  There was no sex between Taeko and Yuji.  Kind of difficult, considering Yuji was actually Taeko's daughter.  The self-mutililation, by removing her breasts, to negate the idea that she was just like her mother, brought home with shocking clarity how damaging parental rape and neglect can truly be.  This film is an acquired taste, cerebral in nature, and not for everyone.",1270944000,,1290,4.875576036866359

Still, it doesn't matter- there's no place to hide.  This movie burrows right into your gut and stays there.  It's not a horror film; it's more of a twisting, surreal drama.  And yet it contains just about every horrific taboo subject you can think of.  Rape, incest, forced voyerism, mutilation, physical and mental abuse- if you can think of it, it's in there.  Did I mention the finale also includes a chainsaw?  Yes, it's poetry, but it's a brutal poem that hits you in the gut, over and over again.  If you're only a casual fan of Asian Cinema, this movie will be like staring into the sun.  Don't do it.  Don't watch.

2737131,1,B000MMLP9G,"Oh give me a break.  I'm sick of all these gushing reviews for this movie.  I watched it last night and what an overblown, overrated piece of junk.  If you're all into art-fart types of things go ahead & go for it.  It should certainly be mentioned that some subjects, specifically incest/pedophelia are dealt with in fashions most Westerners will be shocked by, and such things are done in the movie merely as eye candy, nothing really moves the story along as there is so little story.  You just have a string of ""Oh, this might be happening..  Or maybe it's this..  Or shoot, let's all go get snacks."" kinds of scenes.

I don't doubt at all that some of the actors are very talented.  Too bad I wasn't watching them in something else.  It's just too bad all of this effort couldn't have produced a much more sympathetic treatment of the poor little girl.  Nope, sorry, how it played out didn't work for me.

This would have been an interesting, if rather typical, result for an undergrad film project.  Else, meh.

When Mitsuko's mother apparently dies, her father forces the girl to be the substitution to her dead mother, which drives her to attempt suicide with a leap from a height...yet all of this is apparently just the new novel being penned by reclusive, wheelchair-bound author Taeko. But when a young man appears to her life, everything changed. twist after twist, we find out that all of this are just fantasy.

Japan created many strange stories like boys loves his own sister and eventually have sexual relationship, boy falls in love with step mother and wins over his father and so on. They all win the Naoka Literature award which is one of the biggest award in Japan. Yes the story is very much justified by beautifully written and many of you who read it will begin to feel like Oh that can be possible.

This movie same thing happens. Even if as a guy live near the country cannot feel like comfortable about a father making his own daughter forcely put her inside a cello case and make her watch her while him and the mother have sex wildly. And when the mother dies, he even uses his own daughter as another sex tool which is now a substitution to the mother.

The image of the circus, strange house that they are living in- very modern Europian luxurious house that we can only see in the movies, the blood wall, the candle light room, so many exotic images make us slowly that these all are just maybe adult's (Male's) dulty fantasy.

When everything is being revealed, we feel vain, surprise, donno what to do.
And then their comes along the vengence. A bloody violent vengence.

If I may say you haven't seen anything like this before in your life and not many of you will feel repulsive for some reason even if there are so many nudity, violence, strange images.
Because maybe there is classic music involved ,maybe because of the nicely alonged lights, camera walk, so realistic acting.
Sion Sono also made memorable works like SUICIDE CLUB, LOVE EXPOSURE and I am going to see them all.
It won't be easy I know but it will be worth it for sure. Because it will be a new experience.

When I say the movie is not repulsive, still this movie is not for everyone especially those who wants to have a good sweet evening.
This film is still a nightmare especially when a young man appears in the scene.

I am a big lover of Japanese movies and at first I really liked this film. It shows a young girl Mitsuko who opened the door to her parents bedroom door a bit and peeped in during one of their very passionate love making sessions and took off, dad caught her but said nothing, okay it happens. However after that he makes her watch a tape of himself and her mom doing it, then starts putting Mitsuko in a cello case in the bedroom making her watch their sexual activities. After a few times of this one day after they;re finished having sex he opens the cello case revealing their 12 year old child's presence to his wife who freaks out and who also could have nipped it in the bud before what not long after that happens

Mommy goes out one day and when she returns she searches for her husband and daughter opens the door and sees her husband the incestuous pedophile taking their daughter. What does she do? Nothing. If it were me I'd have removed something. Next he starts putting the wife in the cello case having her watch while he takes their daughter

Daddy starts dressing their daughter in moms clothes the mother goes into rabid dog mode releasing her murderous wrath on her child. Later did nothing to stop the molestation mom gets jealous when she and her daughter are alone starts brutally beating and abusing the girl and trying to kill her. I was upset and really disappointed when the mother did nothing to help her daughter

Movie ending, epic

Leading up to the ending starts Yuji a new guy is hired as a writers assistant and is determined to uncover the the long hidden secrets.

But the pleasure comes more from the form than the content.
