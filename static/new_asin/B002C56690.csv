8617348,5,B002C56690,"It is important to note that there are various prints of this great classsic for sale at Amazon and elsewhere. I have bought and/or seen just about all of them, and the print quality of some is so below par as to question the legality of the source. This version of ""Primero Soy Mexicano"" by ZIMA is excellent. Both picture and sound have been restored to a very good condition.

The story, based on the great play ""M'hijo el dotor"" (A.K.A. ""Los dos derechos"") by the Uruguayan playwriter Florencio Snchez, has been done many times since it was first published in 1903. This is a Mexican adaptation with wonderful acting by Joaqun Pardav and Luis Aguilar, plus excellent singing by Luis Aguilar, Flor Silvestre, and Francisco ""Charro"" Avita.

A great classic.",1361836800,,759,4.786259541984733
