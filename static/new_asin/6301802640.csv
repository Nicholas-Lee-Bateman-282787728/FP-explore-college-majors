368381,2,6301802640,"The movie The Littlest Rebel was a very cute, sweet little movie- fun family entertainment. The story of a little ''Southern Belle'', and her mission to rescue her father from the Yankee Troups, and later execution.  The plot is pretty standard, Shirley of course is a very cute, and a quite  appealing young actress. But the film's message is slippery, even dangerous  at times. Incorrectly portraying black slaves as carefree, happy, childlike  and ignorant, this movie was one of many which reinforced the South's idea  of a ''happy slave.'' This was dangerous considering that at this time  segregation and discrimination were rampant in Southern cities. The movie  itself is sweet and family-oriented, very worth seeing, but the film is  symbolic of a very dangerous system and idea.",962323200,9,788,5.149606299212598

368507,2,6301802640,"The Littlest Rebel, 1935 film

It starts with a big mansion where people eat at a big table. [The behaviors and manners are from the 19th century.] Uncle Billy dances for entertainment. Sally Ann gives a doll to Virgie. The children dance. A rider arrives with news of war! The party is over. Whats a war? I don't know what it means myself. The Virginia Grays march to war. Miss Virgie trains her servants. The Yankees ride up. Virgie misses her Daddy, their area is occupied by the Yankees. She sings when Daddy returns (he is scouting the enemy). The Yankees are coming! Food and supplies are hidden. The Yankees search the house and look for secret panels. An officer straightens things out. They are looking for a Rebel spy. Later the battle reaches the mansion. Mrs. Cary is sick and getting worse. Her husband is notified, he will return (across enemy lines).

Massa Cary arrives to meet his sick wife. She will never be ill again. Yankees are riding up again. Cary hides in the garret. Virgie dances with Uncle Billy. But the Yankee officer observes the marks on the floor and draws the right conclusions. [Dust more often?] The Yankee officer offers a favor to Captain Cary, but it can be dangerous if he is caught. A corporal recognizes Virgie and calls for help. Captain Cary is captured out of uniform! He is condemned, along with Colonel Morrison. Virgie sings to her jailed Dad. Can Uncle Billy and Virgie raise more money for train fare to Washington? Yes, and they meet a high government official. Virgie argues for Captain Cary and Colonel Morrison. The President signs an order that will be rushed to General Grant. Later Virgie sings for the officers. There is a happy ending. [No mention of that Friday night show at the Ford theater.]

This is an interesting fantasy. Is it too cute to be true? The Yankee Colonel does not have a New England accent, the Virginians do not have Southern accent. Nowadays, thanks to omnipresent television, regional accents are in decline. The hardships of war are lightly mentioned, the audiences of the 1930s would appreciate this. It seems like a story to settle grievances among North and South (in so far as that is possible). Were the people held in servitude so agreeable to their owners? Do the history books mention that physical punishment for soldiers? This movie tells about what entertained America in the 1930s. Was it less successful than her other movies? Note the casting of the Captain and the Colonel so they like brothers (for an obvious political statement).",1392854400,,2530,4.758542141230068

As for ""racist"" elements, see my comment to D Vance Smith's rant about the Little Colonel, also made in 1935 with much of the same background and elements.
Just wish Fox would condense some of those series (Shirley Temple, Charlie Chan, etc) into one complete multi-disc collection instead of these partial collections.

We don't have to display every historical artifact we possess--no museums do--so I'd urge Amazon to relegate this film to a dusty archive, or at least to give customers an intimation of what they're in for. The film practices precisely the kind of institutionalised degradation that Quentin Tarantino calls attention to in Django Unchained (except he raises it in order to parody it, a kind of reductio ad absurdum). If you thought Samuel Jackson was over the top in his role in Django, then you may not be unduly disturbed by what Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson is compelled to do in The Littlest Rebel. It's difficult to believe that anyone thought Shirley Temple was cute as a precocious slave owner, or that the peremptory way in which she treats most African Americans was anything but stomach-turning.

That's because it has a great mixture of drama, comedy, song/dance and suspense. Almost all the characters are likable. The two dances scenes with Temple and Bill Robinson are excellent....a joy to watch. I don't know if Shirley ever looked cuter than in this film. She runs the gamut of emotions in here quite frequently.

The 74-minute story never has a lull. John Boles and Karen Moreley are people you root for, Willie Best provides good comedy and there is a surprising amount of suspense.

It's like watching a children's version of Gone With The Wind, and possibly one of Shirley's best performances. An interesting footnote: the movie does not openly proclaim in which region of the Confederacy it takes place, but there are plenty of hints for the observant:
1) Shirely's character name is ""Virgie,"" short for Virginia.
2) An opening scene depicts tobacco fields.
3) Virgie's father crosses back and forth between enemy lines throughout the movie, hinting at a hotly contested region.
4) There are several references to Gen. Lee--who served mostly in Virginia.
5) Mr. Cary states that he wishes to take Virgie to stay with her aunt in nearby Richmond.",1218758400,,788,5.1640625

368549,4,6301802640,"One of Shirley Temple's first movies for the newly-amalgamated Twentieth Century-Fox Pictures in 1935 was THE LITTLEST REBEL (based on an earlier play by Edward Peple).

Set in the South during the Civil War, THE LITTLEST REBEL gave audiences another chance to enjoy Temple in a similarly-themed story to ""The Little Colonel"" (released earlier in 1935 to great acclaim).

In THE LITTLEST REBEL, Shirley Temple plays spunky little Virginia Carey--known as Virgie to her friends.  Dearly loved by everybody, Virgie accidentally causes untold tragedy for her father (John Boles), a Confederate soldier, when he's caught sneaking through enemy territory in a bid to see his ill wife (Karen Morley).  It looks like curtains for Virgie's Pa, until the enterprising moppet decides to take matters into her own hands...

Temple is reunited with her ""Curly Top"" co-star John Boles, plus Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson.  Karen Morley and Jack Holt also turn in fine support.  The score includes ""Polly-Wolly Doodle"", ""Believe Me"", and ""Dixie"".

The DVD includes both B&W and computer-colourised versions of the film.",1178841600,5,1101,5.3604651162790695
368550,4,6301802640,"Critics and analysts have used reams of paper to describe the Shirley Temple phenomenon.  To summarize that analysis:  Shirley Temple appealed to a nation going through economic upheavals because of her cheery disposition and general cuteness.  This movie may have its flaws, but Shirley's sunny disposition and a wonderful tap dance performance by Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson with Shirley make this movie one to watch for fans of Shirley and Bojangles.

The plot is relatively thin.  Virginia ""Virgie"" Cary's (Temple) father is Confederate Captain Herbert Cary (played by John Boles).  Captain Boles is a daring scout who successfully penetrates federal lines to gain valuable information.

Virgie and her mother Mrs. Cary (Karen Morley) live on the Cary plantation with their slaves.  The plantation appears to be near the edge of the Confederacy as Yankees make regular appearances.  Virgie, her mother and the plantation slaves lead a relatively good life until a battle destroys the plantation house and exposure to the elements causes Mrs. Cary to become ill.  Uncle Billy (Bojangles Robinson) heads off to retrieve Captain Cary, traveling with him through federal pickets.

Captain Cary attempts to take Virgie to his sister in Richmond with the aid of Yankee Colonel Morrison (Jack Holt), but Captain Cary is caught and both Cary and Morrison are tried for spying and treason.  After a trial and appeal, both are scheduled to be executed in days.  Only one chance remains, and that is an appeal to a court in Washington, D.C.

Will Virgie and Uncle Billy be able to raise enough money to get to Washington?  Once they get there, will they be able to convince the court that both men are innocent?  Will they be able to do all this in time?  Will any of this stop Shirley Temple and Bojangles from dancing and singing?  Will any of this stop Shirley Temple from being cute?  A viewer will need to watch and discover these answers for themselves!

This movie was intended as light entertainment.  It succeeds.  Shirley is cute, regardless of the circumstances.  Shirley and Bojangles put on incredible dance performances.  Even more incredible considering that Shirley was about six or seven years old at the time.  Bojangles put tap dance into public view and gained his own fame by starring with Shirley Temple.

Some critics point to the inaccurate portrayal of slaves.  The criticism is valid.  The movie was stereotypical.  We know that slavery was an institution that continues to be an embarrassment to our country.  However, the movie was a product of its time.  Accept the movie for what it is rather than an endorsement of slavery.  Note that Uncle Billy is intelligent and incredibly brave.  He is also the most talented person in the movie.

Shirley Temple movies remain enjoyable, light entertainment.  The plots are simple and rely mostly on Shirley and her cuteness and in the case of this movie, the talent of Bill Robinson.  They succeed in their goal of entertaining us.  Shirley Temple fans and fans of Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson need this movie for their collection.

Enjoy!",1165104000,2,3097,5.011787819253438
368551,5,6301802640,"Virgie, a brave Southern girl with a big heart is caught in a world turned upside down as the Civil War seperates her from her doting father, Captin Cary (John Boles). As a scout for the Confederate army, Cary visits his family's now run down plantation when possible . . . but it becomes more and more dangerous as Union Soldiers tighten their grip on the neighborhood. Mrs. Cary does her best to manage the plantation, with the assistance of their cooporative slaves. Especially fun loving ""Uncle Billy"", and his hilarious side-kick, ""James Henry"". But then a battle takes place near their genteel mansion, and they lose their home. Uncle Billy sets off to find his master, and brings him back to his ill wife. While at home, the Union Soldiers come searching for him. Can a sympathising Union Colonel and Virgie with her youthful innocence save him now? Only a visit to Washington can tell. This is one of my favorite Shirley Temple movies. There are several cute song and dance recitals with Shirley and ""Mr. Bojangles"", and the simple minded ""James Henry"" provides comic relief for what could otherwise be a depressing movie (war time movies can sometimes be that way). The only dissapointment for me was that John Bole's role as Captin Cary left something to be desired. It was slightly less convincing than in Curly Top. I definately reccomend this.",1160784000,8,1356,4.799145299145299
368552,5,6301802640,"This beautiful Shirley Temple story is simply wonderful-- with lots of songs, dramatic scenes, and dances with Bojangles this VHS is well worth it's pricetag. If your a fan of Shirley or ""The Little Colonel"" then you'll love this movie! With the wonderful Bojangles(from the The Little Colonel) and James Bole(Curly Top) you'll love this movie.

In this film Shirley plays Virgie a very determined, strong-willed girl who lives in the South when the war breaks-- suddenly Virgie is struggling with her mom to survive as her father serves as a spy for the Confederettes-- while have there house pillared by Yankees who routinely visit looking for Shirley's dad. When Shirley's mom tragically dies-- Shirley's dad makes the vow never to have his child ""leave his arms again"" with the help of a friendly yankee Shirley and her dad make an attempt to go to Richmond to stay with an aunt in her home- only problem getting through yankee lines. When Shirley and her father are captured. Shirley's father and the kind yankee are sentanced to execution. The only way to save them is up to Shirley as she goes to ask Abe Lincoln ""You won't let them kill my daddy will you.""

A heartful and one of my favorite Shirley and Civil War movies of all time. This movie shows off all that talent with her dramatic acting ability, lovable songs, and wonderful dance scenes with one of the greatest dancers of all time. This movie is a keeper to own in your family movie collection. This is a great Civil War story since it dosn't really chose either side of the war and it gives a view that makes you feel in the end no one wins. With great acting and all that talent you can't loose when you buy this treasure! Watch this movie and see America's ""Littlest Charmer.""",1107129600,11,1748,4.5993589743589745

Shirley Temple was cute but pass on this unless you wish it were the 1800s again and you rather I was picking cotton for massah instead of writing this review.",1506470400,,354,4.634920634920635
