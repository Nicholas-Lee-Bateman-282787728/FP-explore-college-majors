8468842,5,B005ER6SZK,"This is my favorite DVD that I own. If I had to sacrifice all but one of my DVDs, I would keep this. I've watched it so many times, and it still impacts me almost every time I watch it. It's just the most satisfying thing I've ever seen on video. If you've ever seen the video on youtube of the Native American man telling off a group of immigration protestors, saying, ""We didn't invite none of you here!"", this movie is as satisfying as that, but for 37 minutes.

Pretty much everything she says in this video is just as if not more true today than it was when she was saying it. Which actually makes the 80s aesthetics of it seem all the more poignant, if you compare how much the world has superficially changed since then versus how little has changed in terms of the subjects Lydia talks about here.",1411862400,3,805,4.261437908496732
