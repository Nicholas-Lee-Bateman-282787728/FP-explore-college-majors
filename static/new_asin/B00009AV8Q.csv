1882910,3,B00009AV8Q,"I rented this movie expecting to see a portrayal of ""Goth culture"" in its stereotypical form (e.g. vampires, thrill killings, ""embracing the darkness""), and well. . . I was right. However, me being familiar with the Goth scene (which is just music despite the claims of an angst ridden teenager), I was able to find some priceless humor in the movie. The humor doesn't apply to just the Goth scene, but any type of music scene where a large portion of its members try and make themselves out to be elitists and live their lives according to the image of whatever music it is that they're into. Goth ( the movie) can be easily described as The Doom Generation meets Training Day; except instead of the co stars (Chrissy and Boone [what the hell kind of name is that?]) struggling to make the narcotics squad, they're on a quest to be able to truly label themselves Goth, and prove to the main character - who by coincidence is named Goth - that they're not poseurs; which leads to Goth threatening the couple to take part in bad things (things that Goths allegedly do when they're together) by taunting them with the dreaded question: ""What's the matter? I thought you guys were Goth?"" Of course there are a few twists in this movie, but I can't figure out how to talk about them without giving everything away. It wasn't the best story in the world, but the movie did keep me entertained which is what it's supposed to do, and it had some really good industrial songs by some lesser known bands which I thought was cool. I'll just conclude my review with a few questions I have (and I'm sure you'll have) after seeing this movie: how could this be a movie about Goths if half of the soundtrack is Electronic-Industrial? How did Boone's glass refill itself with Absinthe after he clearly poured it out in the alley? And who in God's name is driving the van?",1065657600,6,1856,4.510385756676558
1882911,1,B00009AV8Q,"This movie was one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever been subjected to....Not even ""B-movie"" quality....terrible dialogue, minimal plot, uninteresting actors, and laughable (if they weren't so bad) effects/sets.....There is a ""corpse"" in the first scene which is obviously a dummy....!  Don't even think about renting this!",1059868800,,329,5.714285714285714
1882912,5,B00009AV8Q,"I have viewed the entire movie called ""Goth"" on DVD.  In my opinion, it the best reality-based independent horror film that I seen and now own.  I word of caution must be said however.  This film has all the the following (and then some)--- betrayal, cruelty, depravity, murder, perversion, sex, vengeance, and violence.  This is not a shiny-happy people feel-good movie.  The negative attributes only serves as a backdrop to the choices and decisions that the three main characters made in this film.
One of the main reasons I like this film is that it makes you think (simple as that).  The film askes various questions about goth (but on different levels).  What is Goth? Is Goth just music, clothes, and literature or a total and complete lifestyle?  Who makes the decision as who is Goth or not?  That and more.
There are some good elements to this film.  For one thing, it is  very character driven.  This gives the film a very realistic feeling to it.  Phoebe Dollar, as the Goth queen, gave a performance of a lifetime.  The cinematic photography, music, script, sets, and the performances are excellent as far as the independent film standards are.
This is a Goth movie.  I do not personally recommend this film for everyone.  However, if you saw the movie ""Requiem for a Dream"", then this film pushes the envelope to a higher and deeper level.",1058659200,2,1353,4.717948717948718
1882913,1,B00009AV8Q,"I rented this to watch with a group of friends, originally. We saw it in the video store, and wanted to see how awful it was. Gluttons for punishment, my friends and I are.
What we were expecting was some kind of sensationalist crap, written by someone who doesn't really know what they're talking about, trying to cash in on what seems to be the current trend. And basically, that's what this movie is. But as bad as I knew it was going to be, I didn't expect this level of awfulness. It looks like it was shot on someone's home video camera, and the script... well, read on.
""Goth"" is the story of a young girl named Chrissy, who has involved herself in the goth scene of LA. Our tale begins with Chrissy and her boyfriend, Boone, heading off to a concert for some kind of Korn rip-off. There, Chrissy meets the movie's title character. Yes, that's right, there is a character in this movie named Goth. (Get ready for all sorts of puns. ""Hi, I'm Goth!"" ""Yeah, so are we!"") According to Goth, she is the most hardcore person in the scene. Everyone else is just a lame poseur. This, of course, includes Chrissy, and Goth wants to take her under her wing and show her what being goth really means.
Apparently being goth means murdering and raping innocent people for kicks and giggles. Oh, and lots and lots of drugs. Goths, says Goth, are beyond the feelings of guilt and repression that keep normal people in line. God help any 15 year old babybat whose mother sees this movie.
So, what happens? Does sweet, innocent Chrissy stop Goth? Or does she turn to the dark side and become Goth's spooky little sidekick? Do you even care? I'm sure that some of you may think that this film sounds amusing, but trust me, it isn't. It's just bad. Save your money.",1056931200,6,1753,4.430340557275541
1882933,3,B00009AV8Q,"okay, if you press play expecting hollywood special effects and shots made with $5000 dollar cameras you will be disappointed.

but if you watch this movie expecting a film about stereotypes, naivety and the malleability of the human mind you'll love it.

this is a movie that needs to be looked at for its story, rather than its production values.  if you like overlooked movies that could have been better with a larger budget, but still hold some merit, this movie will be worth at least one watch

[and the music video on the dvd by erace doesn't exactly suck either]",1172793600,,571,4.623762376237623
1882934,2,B00009AV8Q,"alright first off, yes this movie was shot with a hand held cam. it was shot in my own and i was in it at one point. they cam rolling into town acting like they were soem big shot holly wood producers asking for extras and i got drug along for the ride, the people in the movie actthat way in real life and it's extreamly sad but hallarious. when i saw the movie, my first thoughts were, this sucks, but i'll give them credit for trying considering there were only three ppl besides the actors involved in making this movie",1161043200,3,523,4.188118811881188

1882937,1,B00009AV8Q,"I agree with my fellow critic, Mr Martin.... worst movie ever made.  All I could think after watching this movie was ""that is 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.""  Bad acting, bad special effects, bad script.  The only good thing about this movie was when it was over!  DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!! Set it down and run far, far away.",1128556800,12,339,4.090909090909091
1882938,1,B00009AV8Q,"This is without a doubt the worst movie ever made.

Ya the worst movie ever made.

Let me make sure you understand what I mean when I say that it is THE WORST MOVIE EVER PUT TO FILM IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIE MAKING. This makes Hunting Humans look like the Exorcist.

I would rather give myself an at home vasectomy with my neighbors rabid cat than watch this movie again.

But...  ...If you have to watch, if your curiosity cannot be contained, be sure to check out all of the killer special features (LOL). And be sure to watch the riveting trailer to get ya in the mood. But if you wish, I can give ya a synopsis of the film and spare you the pain that no one living should ever have to know. (Without the aid of some special brownies of course :) )

The story follows the riveting journey of these two characters. One who lookes like Shannen Doherty, and the other that lookes like a wannabe gothic Lance Bass. They are a couple, and they are also ""gothic"". They go to a ""gothic"" club. Just to show you how gothic this movie is so far. The boyfriend's name is Boone, how gothic is that.

While at this ""gothic"" club, they meet this gothic chick (I am not bull sh*ting you) named ""Goth"". You heard it boys and girls a goth girl actually named ""Goth"". The worst wannabe in the history of the gothic culture has never stooped this low. WTF!

Goth tells them the three rules.

1 Embrace the darkness

2 Kill your fear

3 Live for death

To make a long story short, Goth kills a few people while strung out on this flour like substance called White light. Ohhh so scary. The special effects are more like the special olympics, and the acting is even worse.  The retarded kid who played Corkie did a better job.  Kermit the frog is more gothic than anything in this POS movie. This movie was written by a man who knows nothing about the gothic culture from his own admission. Not a single f*@king thing. If your looking to top yourself tonight, be sure to rent this first, because you won't want to live much longer after you do.

Stay away, don't go towards the light Carolann.

1882939,3,B00009AV8Q,"The movie was ok, i like it because of the bloody scenes and the ending was quite differnt but im sure one would expect this. Some parts were stupid, I don't know where to pinpoint it. The beginning was odd. The Actors started out with an English accent and then in the club scene they were talking normally, or in an american accent.
I don't have much to say on this..the plot..is confusing in a way...Chrissy is out to get revenge on her sisters death and she has a feeling that Goth killed her sister. And Goth is showing Boone and Chrissy about the Dark life of being goth. I found the whole steteotypical thing stupid..but oh well. The music is good, i enjoyed it. Theres a lot of Drug usage and boobs in the movie so if you're into that..go for it.",1069891200,,754,4.27972027972028

7990731,1,B00009AV8Q,"I bought this movie yeeears ago from a closing Movie Gallery. At first, I was excited for a film about the gothic subculture- MY subculture.

Upon actually seeing it, that previous excitement came to bite me in the butt. First, it looks like it was filmed with a camcorder, the quality being absolutely awful (though, I didn't expect much with that). Second, the acting was super cringy. I've seen better acting in a high school play. Third, wtf was that plot??? This ""film"" actually made my brain hurt. This is actually worse than Phsyched by the 4D Witch (which is really saying something if you've seen that stinkfest).

After forcing myself to sit through that torment, I hid it away from the world, only getting it out once and a while to remember how terrible it is.

Fast forward to this year, we invited a bunch of friends over, started drinking, and gave it the MST3K treatment. It was still absolutely horrible, but forcing friends to sit through it (whilst making fun of it) made it slightly more tolerable.

This ""movie"" stars Pheobe Dollar, and having seen some of her other work, it's all about the same quality as ""Goth"". Just avoid anything with Pheobe Dollar in it, if you value your sanity.

If you really want to sit through this catastrophe, make sure you have lots of good booze, good friends (ones that you KNOW will still talk to you after seeing this), and a good sense of humor.

WARNING, if you watch this, do NOT try to take it seriously. You will want to shoot yourself.",1481414400,,1498,4.57089552238806

7990734,3,B00009AV8Q,"I'm fairly divided on most movies. They fall into three categories for me: awesome, boring, and painful to watch.
Goth is one of those films that carefully toes the line between awesome and painful to watch, in much the same way as a Coen Brothers film.
Unlike any of the Coen Brothers' work, however, Goth is a low-budget, homemade festival of bizarre stupidity tailor-made to be full of intentional cheese.
The plot concerns a late teen or early twentysomething Gothic couple who live together in an apartment in LA. The beginning of the film makes a huge point of how goth they are, and the couple constantly talking about how goth they are. Then they go to a goth club, just to show how goth they are. Even more Gothic by far? They meet a girl named Goth.
Goth gets the couple wigged out on drugs and leads them on a hedonistic spree of sex and murder. I will say that each and every one of the scenes of sex and violence is impossibly funny coupled with Goth's rants about worshipping death and embracing the darkness.
Just from that summary you've probably figured out by now that this movie sounds absolutely horrible: it is.
However, if you enjoy fake blood and guts, hammy b-list actors pretending to act crazy and/or scared in something vaguely resembling a high school drama performance, and silly lines, you may very well find Goth's infuriating lack of any cinematic quality to be its main charm.",1294099200,,1409,4.64
7990735,5,B00009AV8Q,"I love this movie! Yes, it's low (as in no) budget, but it has a lot of dark, black heart. It's less about being ""goth"" than it is about a girl who is named Goth (Phoebe Dollar from Hell's Highway). Goth is a woman without limits or conscience. I was intrigued by her ability to do anything she pleased without fear or concern. This is a woman who could just as easily kill you as talk to you! I like that in a woman! The couple that Goth kidnaps is in for a hellish ride! So, if you enjoy the bleak world of the unhinged, GOTH should flip your coffin lid!

7990738,5,B00009AV8Q,"Few movies are capable of speaking for an entire culture or generation. There's an intangible connection amongst certain people who share a lifestyle choice that is recognized but never fully conveyed through words. Our director here has captured that essence and made a powerful social commentary in the process. His style reminds me of a young Russ Myers blended with the more refined skill and subtlety Coppola in his early years. The character of 'Goth"" makes us ask ourselves what it is we expect of those living on the fringe, and challenges our preconceptions of those we cannot immediately relate to. One can suggest that our talented young director has used these characters as a representative of Arab or middle eastern persons living in a post 9/11 America. Goth (the character) appeals to the frustration of the youth who have been marginalized by the ignorant society they feel trapped in. She plays on these frustrations as well as their innocence and sculpts their impressionable minds in a way perhaps similar to an Al-Queda or Taliban recruiter might. The film raises more questions then answers and forces us to look inward and confront aspects of our own personalities and culture that mirror the peer pressure placed on the young couple by the character. Existentialists will surely appreciate the obvious influences that Jodorowsky and Kenneth Anger have had on this filmmaker. The dominate acting style of Phoebe Dollar blends perfectly with the more submissive style utilized by the beautiful laura Reilly, creating a brilliant dichotomy representing the internal struggle between our natural ego or selfishness and the values we have absorbed through society. I believe Gandhi said it best when he proclaimed, ""vah haath jholaa kisakaa hai? Kyaa koee yahaan angrejee bolataa hai? Aap mere liye yah anuvaad kar sakate."" Think about it.",1223942400,8,1858,5.176079734219269
