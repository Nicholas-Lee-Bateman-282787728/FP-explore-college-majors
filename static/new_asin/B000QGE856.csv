2838599,5,B000QGE856,"My first guitar was a knock off gold top Les Paul. My second was the real deal. My first tape recorder did not have sound on sound or multi-track ability. My second had both. Getting the point here? Maybe it's my age group, but Les Paul and his work meant so much on so many levels and here comes a riveting doc on his life. How could I resist it? And well I should not.

Les Paul Chasing sound is an awesome story told first hand by an awesome man who changed the course of music and the music business so dramatically. Not only as a player/performer, but as a recording enthusiast and inventor of tools to better record music. That's on the story level.

On the production level, PBS and American Masters may very well have outdone themselves with Chasing Sound. I enjoy all of the American Masters profiles from Ella to Bernstein to Rockwell, but this production is simply the best one ever. Maybe it's all the first hand story-telling. Maybe it's all the incredible guitar playing. Maybe it's going into Les' house to see the old stuff laying around and to hear his 'this is how I did it' tales. I can only say that 2 hours into this production I was still sitting tight being entertained by Les Paul... who to this day remains incredibly personabable and insanely entertaining.",1187481600,,1282,4.497854077253219
2838600,5,B000QGE856,"Les Paul is an icon to all us guitar players.... As such, it's really difficult to construct an adequate description of him..... He has given so much to the music world and, in turn, to the world at large in his nearly 100 years on this planet.... His contribution is pretty astounding.

From his original concept of ""sound on sound"" recording and the first true solid body guitar to his succesful efforts to obtain Django Reinhardt's rightful recording royalties to Django's widow, Naguine.... Les Paul's legacy is literally chasing him down....

This DVD is a must for anyone who has ever had even the slightest brush with the genius of Les Paul. In my house, his recordings with Chet Atkins called ""Chester and Lester"" rank right up there with the family Bible and the invention of hair in degrees of importance.... Along with all of my beautiful Les Paul guitars of course...

If you love popular music, Les Paul has had an influence on you, perhaps without you even knowing it......

Buy this DVD........ It bloody well rules.....!! I don't even have a DVD player and it still plays...THAT's how good it is.......

I love the scene with Eddie Van Halen blushing and kissing Les on the cheek onstage.... It kinda helps put it all into perspective.... All of us career musicians of the last 50+ years owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Les and his genius.........

Plus you get to see Django Reinhardt's own Selmer Maccaferri guitar...

How cool is that.....?

Seeing how Les Paul evolved; inventing and creating trends of sound for and with the likes of other great artists, is just amazing.  Truly an American icon, one of our nations greatest ambassador to music.  Not just every guitarist should want to watch this dvd, every musician, artist, oh heck, everyone should watch this.  It's a great look at early radio, electronics, jazz, American culture and history.  It provides a great window into the past to witness this man's contribution to music.

I just saw the show on PBS/OBP (Oregon's Public Broadcasting ""affiliate"" if you will - this state may be lovely, but do they have to ""pretend"" they invented or own the concept of Public Broadcasting? - I THINK NOT!).

Les Paul IS, without any question, the Greatest Musical Creator. And not just (an obviously bleached out blonde) Richard Carpenter, but anyone who claims to love or have a clue about guitars, music, harmonics, arrangements should be in his (as well as Mary Ford)'s debt.

In this age of techno-this & automated-that, nothing will ever compare with his (or their) unsung contributions! LONG LIVE LES PAUL! And Mary Ford!",1184457600,12,806,4.833333333333333

In this documentary, you see and hear from Les about career, his inventions and life from the early to now. You hear him tell his side of the story in his work with music greats, the people he performed with, where he learned his chops and cut his teeth. Then you'll see and hear from respected industry pro's he impacted and see the effect of his recordings and his 'sound' upon those who are well known household names and those behind the scenes. This is Les Paul's life throughout the ages, from young inventor, to well respected jazz guitarist, to serviceman, to band leader, all throughout his career, retirement and comebacks. It shows takes from early clips and photos,  the TV shows, previous anniversaries and dedication events. Happy Birthday Les and thank you.

While this DVD did do just that, I was disappointed that more time wasn't devoted to the guitar itself. Les Paul DID invent multi-tracking and the music industry was changed FOREVER!  All in all, it was an interesting DVD.",1414713600,,314,4.589285714285714
2838669,5,B000QGE856,"As a guitarist of 55 years this DVD is the best I have seen. Wish it were longer and explained various segments better, but, for 90 minutes I was enthralled by the genius of Les Paul. From Paul's early years to his long life span the DVD is spellbinding. Les Paul and Mary Ford as a duo is discussed, reverently, and, how the two of them created, arranged, produced their sound is reviewed. Many points of Les actually playing guitar with the worlds major renowned musicians. Paul's humbleness and his reverence for his' idols is covered. A must have for any one who plays an instrument, uses a mixing board, or is simply curious about how music evolved electronically, or musically. The sections where Les jams with other musician's is a joy to view, as Paul exhibits ""joy"" during playing.
Too short is the DVD (90 minutes) but an example of a long life, well lived.",1411689600,2,867,4.564102564102564

THEN it kicked into high gear and the research, historic film footage and audio, interviews with THE MAN himself, location shots of his equipment and inventions, all came together in a great presentation of why this man has is so esteemed. Fast paced (after the first 25 minutes or so), compelling graphically, sharp in presentation...! Paul is elderly during much of this, but he is razor sharp--this isn't some wistful view from the eyes of a doddering old man. I was glued to the set, soaking it all in....as you should be. There's not a modern recording of music--or the making of rock music--that doesn't owe it all to this man...a visionary genius, master inventor and engineer, luthier, guitar virtuouso... documented in one DVD!",1407024000,,949,4.9375

It explores his inventions that drastically developed electric guitars and multitrack recording so important in today's music. It also explains in detail his secrets for recording back in the early 1950's that created unusual and beautiful music with rather primitive equipment by todays standards. I saw this and hurried to NYC to see Les in person a few years before he passed away. Despite never getting a high school education, he in fact should have been a recording engineer.

Electronic pickups, overdubbing, multi-track recording, and techniques that influence every pop record made to this day.",1351036800,,369,5.166666666666667
2838690,4,B000QGE856,"Now I have to say that this film is NOT a biography about Les Paul. But it does give you a brief insight to his humble beginnings from a small town to his working relationship to Mary Ford and eventually marrying her. (Which the film did not really cover. A fact that I learn only through the historic video that was included in the film.) The film actually does focus on Les Paul and his accomplishment. But to hear the beginnings of his work from the man himself is like sitting in the room with him and feeling history. Lets not forget, the man can still play even in his late age. More importantly you can see and hear it in his music.

What's great about this film was that it does illustrate how much of an inventor Les Paul was (like his early works in developing a 4-track recording system)!

Overall, this is definitely a great DVD to own, regardless if you're a Gibson lover or a Fender lover. Cause there was bit in the film that did discuss the rivalry between the 2 companies. (Fender Les Paul...? Nah!!) Either way, regardless, the film does justice in giving you a broad view of how the music industry had changed over the decades, in both tone and technology.",1335657600,,1175,4.385321100917431

2838692,5,B000QGE856,"Whether a musician or not, this documentary on the life and work of Les Paul is one of the finest musical biographies I have seen.
By charting Paul's career from the earliest days, it also covers a big part of the history of country music and jazz, and is one of the few
such documents that shows just how closely entwined country instrumental music and jazz actually are.
The show is virtually music from beginning to end, even with the talking heads illustrating points.
The extras are worth the price of admission alone... with a wonderful 90 minute concert at a New York jazz club, up close and personal showing how, at 90,
Les Paul is such a complete entertainer. Just wonderful, uplifting and highly recommended.",1318550400,,718,4.7063492063492065

If you really appreciate good music i highly suggest this video to any anyone. The reason we make albums today is because of this genius. Watch this dvd and i guarantee that you will enjoy and recommend to everyone else. As this film inspires you inspire others.",1296604800,,466,4.367816091954023
2838694,5,B000QGE856,"Anyone who has ever wanted or thought about playing guitar knows Les Paul.  And it really doesn't matter if you don't know what he did or who he was.  He was never bought out by Hollywood or the Record Industry. In fact, he quit making music because of high demands from greedy record companies and producers.  The schedule he was on nearly killed him.

But what about the PBS show?  It is just amazing historical information.  As I sat listening to Les and Mary I was just blown away with his style and absolute genius as not only a player, but as a Sound Engineer.  The guy was Way ahead of his time and really DID change the music industry.

The PBS documentary was VERY well done and at times actually brought chills down my spine and some tears to flow as I missed Les and his character.  The beauty of his works with Mary Ford are very well documented in this video.  PBS producers really did him justice in this video and the only problem is the video just scratches the surface of a legend and a genius.

I was even thinking that this video should be in all American History classes.  He was one great inventor and really understood what most people take for granted.

I recommend this even to those with NO musical talents.  Just the bare history is fascinating in it's own right.  On top of that, the video is entertaining and refreshing.  At times I held back tears because of the beauty of his style and the pairing of Mary Ford's voice onto the tracks... amazing!  If you think about what he had to work with as far as electronics, it is really amazing what he got done.

I don't think you can listen to him play and not feel something that is greater than the man who is doing it.  Yes, he was that good and I dare say he is the best guitar player of our time.

Get this video now!  You can watch it with commercials (very few) on Hulu.  I decided to order this video based on the broadcast on Hulu.  I recommend that everyone who loves great music and genius to get this DVD.

I just wish Les Paul could have stuck around for another 100 years. Will anyone ever matter as much to the music world as Les Paul did?...I think not.",1274659200,,299,4.454545454545454
2838716,5,B000QGE856,"I learned a lot from this video. I knew Les Paul was an innovator but didn't know how prolific he really was. The interviews with him, alongside original guitars and recording equipment (some now in the Smithsonian) are fascinating. His recollections of working with big names such as Bing Crosby, Mary Ford, and Gibson are priceless. Speaking of Mary Ford - I had never really heard her like this. She was incredibly talented; a female Bing Crosby! Excerpts from Les demonstrating multi-tracking and stories of how he and Mary recorded in the bathroom, the car, and anywhere else where he could get the sound he wanted, make you feel like a part of it all. Les's exuberance for life (I don't think there is one moment in this video where he is not smiling!) continued to the end and this video aptly reveals that. Before I bought this video I thought - Yeah, people say Les Paul did a lot of things... Now I have some idea of the depth and breadth of his contributions. And I was pleasantly surprised to see the video contained footage of Les playing with current stars. If you are a guitar fan, if you are interested in recording techniques, if you like music from a by-gone era, I highly recommend this video!",1264982400,,1212,4.564220183486238

Les Paul was one of the few modern innovators who could hold a candle to great inventors like Edison and Bell, and he smoked on the guitar! What he did for the world of music recording is also impressive, and anyone who records a note of pop or rock music is indebted to Les Paul.",1256774400,,361,4.246376811594203
2838719,5,B000QGE856,"Quite often the word genius is bandied about, and given to people who barely deserve it, people who will be little noted nor long remembered.  Let it not be so with Les Paul, one of the most musically innovative people of the twentieth century, whose innovations with sound have inspired generations of musicians.

When you listen to the Rolling Stones or The Beatles or Eric Clapton or many other recording artists, the guitar sound you are listening to may be coming from a Les Paul Gibson guitar, or a Les Paul designed pick, one of the first electric guitars ever made, which enabled a revolution in sound, and the evolution of rock and roll.

If you listen to The Beatles Eleanor Rigby, Paul McCartney double tracking his own vocals, with 'Ah, look at all the lonely people,' this is thanks to Les Paul's innovation in creating multitrack recording.  Similarly, when Michael Jackson multi tracks his own vocals on 'Leave Me Alone'.  Similarly Paul McCartney's first album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McCartney/dp/B000002UC5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McCartney</a>was entirely recorded on a 4 track Studer multi track recorder, with McCartney playing all the instruments.

Les Paul started out as a musician, and became an outstanding one, learning his craft as a jazz musician with greats such as Django Reinhardt, and then becoming a recording artist, even collaborating with Bing Crosby, and having numerous hits with his own wife Mary Ford. He had  a desire to multilayer his own musicianship, and his wife's singing, and this inspired his many innovations in sound.

You may be familiar with one of his number one hits 'How high the moon,' and if you listen, you can notice his riffs are so quick, dazzlingly fast.  If you're like me, you may find this movie inspiring, and next time you listen to a recording you may wonder what aspect of it may have been made possible by an inventiness and enterprise, and the genius of Les Paul.

I hope this review is helpful to you, and I hope you enjoy the movie.",1256601600,,2060,5.086053412462908
2838720,5,B000QGE856,"The DVD is described well by others here but I watched it last night and just wanted to add another positive review. Talk about a person who operated without any creative or innovative boundaries. Les is the man. And this DVD addresses his ability to multitask at the very highest levels in a very complete and organized way. I also found it every bit as interesting for the insights into the life of Mary Ford. She was the perfect collaborator for him and the ground breaking music they made together utilized her intelligence, creativity and natural musical gifts as much as it did Mr. Paul's.

Great DVD. And apparently there's another hour and a half of ""extras"" that I still get to watch.

I had already seen the movie last Fall on PBS and had videotaped it off the air.  After seeing him in NY, I decided to purchase the DVD because of the ""extras"" on it.
I'm SO glad I did!  Besides the TV clips, photos and other goodies, there is a section from his 90th birthday at Iridium.  This is a keepsake as it was just like the night I was there.  In addition, I was floored with the expertise of the video shoot.  It is flawless.  To be able to capture the video in such a small club, make it glossy yet make the viewer feel like they're right there is not an easy task.  The audio is absolute perfection.
I would not be surprised if Les himself had the final word on this mix.  When I left the Iridium that night, I grabbed a brochure on my way out.  The next day I read it and found that the ""Meyer sound system"" in the club was conceived by Les!  I'm an audiophile and former Chief Engineer for several 50KW stations.  When I sat down in the club and heard the sound, I knew then that like me, Les is a perfectionist.

You will really enjoy this DVD.  I give it 5 stars.  Go see him live.
He's there every Monday night.  You won't be disappointed.",1216166400,,1283,4.007905138339921

We first meet the mischievous and questing Les Polsfuss from Wauskeshaw, Wisconsin as he takes his mom's phone and radio to amplify himself for local performances.  We follow him through his earliest country/hillbilly music phase through his baptism into the Chicago Jazz scene, and off from there to California and New York.  Les on his early on-stage schooling by his great contemporaries:  ""Charlie [Christian, in Harlem] just nailed me right to the wall.  I got beat by everybody.  And rightfully so.  And that's why I learned.  I got the privilege to play with the all greats in their prime.""  Along the way, many of the personalities incidental to American music pop in for well-produced commentary.  I found Les' relationship with one-time wife Mary Ford and his partnership with Chet Atkins to be among the most heartwarming parts of the story.

The crafters of the excellent documentary also take full advantage of the music of the era as well as film, video and stills.  This has got to be the definitive film story of the life of this American original, Les Paul, and is a very good companion to other great American music histories.",1210291200,,1395,4.889361702127659
2838749,5,B000QGE856,"This is a fabulous biography of an amazing man. This is a must see for any guitarist. Les Paul was a great guitar player that perhaps does not get enough credit as such because of his choice to make a living rather than just make music, as many of his jazz contemporaries did. Not content or more likely not capable of being satisfied just being a world class musician, he was also one of the inventors of the solid body electric guitar as well as  multi-track recording. He is also the namesake of one of the most successful  guitars of all time, Gibson's Les Paul. At 90 plus years old, he is still playing weekly concerts at his night club in Manhattan.

The director, John Paulson has done an excellent job compiling and editing footage from decades of TV shows and movies featuring Mr. Paul as well as many interviews of the man himself and many of his legion admirers. Anyone watching this movie is sure to wind up feeling like a slacker in comparison to the talented workaholic that is Les Paul. Highly recommended.",1209427200,,1022,4.513513513513513
2838750,5,B000QGE856,"I was amazed at how much about Les Paul I learned from this documentary.  I thought I was pretty knowledgeable, since I have a couple of Les Paul and Mary Ford albums.  I was completely unaware how long Les had been active as a professional musician before that.  I vaguely knew that he had played a fair bit for Bing Crosby, but not much more than that.  And of course I was aware of how crucial he had been for the development of recording techniques.  Many regard Tom Dowd as perhaps the most important recording engineer of the past half century, but he was quite upfront that while he took recording technology to the levels that made the recordings of the fifties and sixties and beyond possible, he became aware of the possibilities of the technology from the pioneering work of Les Paul.

Although much of the documentary focuses on a recent concert by the Les Paul Trio, fronted by Les shortly after his ninetieth birthday (the man has been a professional musician for over seventy years!), there is a wonderful amount of vintage or archival footage, photos of Les playing guitar with Art Tatum, or footage with Bing Crosby.  As I said, I was amazed at how much he had accomplished before meeting Mary Ford.  But the bits with Mary Ford were exceptionally enjoyable.  I personally think that female pop singing has in recent decades gone completely into the toilet.  I blame Whitney Houston, partly just to have someone to blame but partly because she was one of the singers to popularize taking a syllable and using 6 or 7 notes to express it.  Or as one of the commentators in this documentary might express it, she popularized ""bending"" the notes.  I am, on the other hand, vastly more impressed by purer singers, who can sing a note without the use of needless artifice, and sing in clear, undiluted tones.  Linda Thompson is a singer of this type.  So was Sandy Denny.  And Mary Ford certainly was.  Her voice is so lovely that she doesn't have to use vocal tricks to make what she is singing interesting.

The film features a host of really interesting commentators, from music authorities like Gary Giddens to friends to fellow musicians.  Some of them are thrown in simply because they are prominent, even though they have little interesting to say, but several definitely enlighten the topics under discussion.

I was a bit surprised that the documentary held off so long in dealing with the one thing about Les Paul that nearly everyone knows about:  his Gibson guitar and how it came about.  They do get to it, but only as the entire affair is beginning to come to a close.  The documentary thus displays the three major ways that Les Paul has had an impact on modern music:  1) the pioneering of sound on sound recording; 2) the creation of the Gibson Les Paul guitar, which is still -- along with the Fender Stratocaster -- the most widely used solid body guitar by professional musicians; and 3) his own music, whether performed as part of the Les Paul Trio, with Mary Ford, or with someone else.

On top of all this, the documentary makes him seem like an extraordinarily nice man.  I've seen him interviewed before (for instance, once on Conan O'Brien, where he presented Conan with his very own signature Les Paul guitar) and every time I've seen him he does indeed seem enormously likable.  All in all, this is a fine documentary, celebrating the man, his music, and his enormous contributions to modern music.",1208476800,,3437,4.6583747927031505

2838769,5,B000QGE856,"Les Paul was, and is, IT.  And this DVD details why and how LP is 'da man'.  Even being a relatively old guy myself, in my youth, a Les Paul was a guitar, not a man.  But indeed he is a man, an extraordinary man that set the standard and capabilities for so much that would come in the modern rock world and more.  The DVD covers a great deal of musical history and the pleasure of it to see Les Paul the man in action, both as a youngster and today, at over 90 years old.

For those of you who may be hoping that this video concentrates on the Gibson Les Paul model guitar, that mainstay of rock music over the last 55 years, you may find yourselves disappointed.  Certainly the evolution of that guitar is chronicled here, but is very far from the primary thrust.

Anyone wishing to know about the early days of multi-track recording, popular guitar back when Les was king, and even learning about Les as a TV star, will find this a joy.  I've watched my copy about 5 times now!",1194652800,,980,4.175531914893617

Simply put, Les Paul is the inventor who made one of the first electric guitars (Leo Fender developed one around the same time).  Les was looking for something different than the cumbersome guitars available, and even though his starting place was a railroad tie, his Les Paul guitars are going to be his part of his legacy.  For more of his legacy - you've got to buy this DVD!

Les Paul has been a gigging musician for most of his 90 plus years.  He's the inventor of multitrack recording and he's a hero to a great number of the men and women who are on your i-pod right now.

This program was originally broadcast on PBS and I waited with my catcher's mitt for the moment the DVD would be available.  Watch this program, buy this program!

I am glad to say he still lives and plays with still amazing skill at 94 years old to sold out crowds in New York city. This video does such a wonderful job honoring a man that was driven to create a better way to record and improve the guitar so much so that Gibson named a model after him when he redesigned it.

2838792,5,B000QGE856,"After that ridiculous tribute that seemed more like a ""cover-up""--""American Made/ World Played""--I was beginning to suspect the 90-year-old (now 92) legend was all illusion, more Wizard of Oz than Wizard of Waukesha.  Rest assured that Les is no, not yet at least, mere icon or totem.  Far from a barely preserved specimen wheeled out on stage in a rocker, he maintains his balance on a precarious stool and serves as ringmaster for the Monday night festivities at the Iridium.  Of course, he's surrounded by and partly carried by some ace New York musicians, who enable Les to bask, deservedly, in the spotlight and evade anything resembling breakneck virtuosity on the instrument.

This is a five-star DVD for the 90-minute PBS history alone--OR for the 90 minutes worth of extras, such as the Iridium set.  Add the two together, factor in the bargain price, and this disc is nothing less than 180 minutes of indispensable, must viewing.  The audio fidelity and production values are first rate, whether the music is vintage Lester or his more recent musical activities which, for the most part, have gone unrecorded for the past 30 years.  The extras include ""honest"" musical exchanges with Keith Richards and a rare opportunity to see and hear a latter-day Kay Starr, no worse for wear than Les, singing ""Exactly Like You.""  Then there's Merle Haggard and Les doing ""Pennies from Heaven,"" both of them practically honoring the tune's simple melody.  And a delightful duet on ""Avalon"" with Chet Atkins circa 1990 (The secret's out.  The supposedly ""intuitive"" musician Les knows keys! Rather than holding down one finger to signal one flat, he mouths ""F"" to the piano player for his solo turn).

One can only hope that some of the guitarists on the ""American Made/World Played"" CD will discover this DVD and subsequently go to some of the pre-1948 Les Paul recordings.  He may not have been a harmonic-melodic genius, but he was a superb technician and tasteful musician in the Django tradition.  His early trio recordings are 2-3 minute masterpieces, and as the featured jazz guitarist to appear at the first Jazz at the Philharmonic in 1944, he and fellow headliner Nat King Cole managed to bring down the house, whether on up-tempo blues or the challenging but always welcome (in fact, the most-recorded pop standard of all time) ""Body and Soul.""",1188777600,24,2352,4.939086294416244
2838793,5,B000QGE856,"Maybe it goes without saying...but just in case it doesn't, ANYONE who is reading this either knows enough about who Les Paul is, and needs to buy this DVD; or you don't...and need to buy this DVD! Obviously done by people who know and respect the living legend, this DVD is a great overview of the Man; a loving tribute while he is still with us. Juxtaposing current footage (YES he still performs), with some heritage showing why he is revered as the inventor of modern recording techniques, this DVD is the bargain of the year for musicians, and lovers of music alike. Sure, as a guitar player/collector I wish they'd focused a bit more on the his involvement with the development of the Gibson Les Paul model that I cherish so much. But anyone who has been an icon for over half a century needs more than a 90 min DVD to cover even the basics. And I also realize that for most viewers, the history of why and how someone could so influence music, that even after 50, 60, 70+ years we're only still only fine tuning his ideas and designs might seem a bit too...geeky (if that's a word?). In many ways he's the Edison of modern music, and EVERYONE who has read this review to this point should just spend the $15 or Les this DVD costs and thank me later...

2838795,5,B000QGE856,"This DVD is such a joyous celebration of Les Paul and his life, his influence on the recording industry and his influence on musicians, that for a reviewer, especially a novice one like myself, with so many positives aspects to discuss about this DVD, it would probably be best if I just said, ""Buy it.""

But, I can't...  because there just aren't that many quality biographical DVD's out there that have no flaws.

In ""Les Paul Chasing Sound,"" you have the life of guitarist extraordinaire Les Paul and his amazing story of taking his guitar talents first to Chicago, and all its jazz clubs, then to New York City, and finally to Hollywood.  As he takes this journey, he shares with the viewer the reasons for his choices, and how each one built upon another.  The editing is superb, with the director choosing clarity for the viewer over continuity, as pieces of interviews conducted in several environments are interwoven to give the viewer an excellent, well thought-out story.

Then, there is the story of Les Paul the inventor, as he recounts the set-backs he encountered in developing a solid core electric guitar, first for Epiphone, then Gibson.  It was only after Leo Fender developed the Fender Strat in the early 1950's did Gibson come a calling for Les to show them what his solid body guitar do for them. It is disputed between McGinty of Gibson and Les Paul as to Paul's actual involvement in the process, but there is not doubt that having the name ""Les Paul"" on the head stock didn't hurt sales any.

The story isn't always a happy one, the automobile accident on a snowy road broke his right arm so badly that the doctor wanted to cut-it-off; however, another doctor said, ""This man is an amazing musician. We cannot end his musical career that way.""  So, it was decided to set his arm in such as way to allow him to continue to play the guitar.

The late 40's and early to mid-50's were glorious times for Les Paul and his wife Mary Ford (original name Colleen Summers, but renamed by Les so that her name would be short in length, like his, and it would fit better on the billboards), as they had Top-Ten hit after hit.  Then, Rock-and-Roll came and his music fell out of favor.

I could go on-and-on about the program, but I won't, why should I tell you  everything, but what I will tell you is that this DVD is worth its price just for the extras: the clips of Les playing with Keith Richards, Chet Atkins, Kay Starr, et. al., the full-length performances of him and the Les Paul Trio playing at he Iridium Jazz Club in New York City, clips from TV appearances, and extended conversations featured in the movie that you can view easier as an extra to the DVD.

Finally, there's one other reason music lovers and musicians, guitarist or otherwise, should buy and listen to this DVD on Les Paul, there is the exuberance that Les Paul, at 90 years young, still shows for life.

I entitled this review ""A Joyous Celebration of Sounds Caught and Thrown Back to Others,"" because, to me, Les Paul took and developed those recording sounds we take for granted today...  sound-on-sound, sound with sound, echo, over-dubbing, and he, like one of those fishermen on a TV fishing show does when he catches a 10 pound bass, throws those concepts back so that others can learn them and make better recordings.

This DVD is a celebration, it is a joy to watch, and it gives us so much insight into Les Paul, the evolution of music, especially jazz, in the mid-1900's.",1187568000,16,3474,4.568438003220612

We see LPs New Jersey home, his sound equipment and his guitar collection and we hear great anecdotes concerning Gene Autry, Miles Davis and Bing Crosby.  We go to Gibson and see Les Paul guitars coming through their creation/assembly line and see the tribute to LP at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Most important, we see Les play and we hear Mary sing.  We see his initial tape recorder/additional head construction that made overdubbing possible and we see Les inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame (a very select group).
