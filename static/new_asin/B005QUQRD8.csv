4860298,1,B005QUQRD8,This movie takes you in many directions never really completing a story. Very disappointed. I haven't seen a movie this bad since Red Riding Hood. Not only am I am recommending you don't buy..don't rent it.,1332288000,,206,4.75
4860299,3,B005QUQRD8,"TANNER HALL is like a very interesting puzzle delivered to the audience in pieces so disconnected that we never get a final reward form the completion of the puzzle.  Written and directed by newcomers Francesca Gregorini and Tatiana von Furstenberg it has a script that seems to want to be embellished or at least reinsert what seems to be like fragments of a longer film that still dwell on the cutting room floor.  But for what it is, it is an entertaining stage for the presence of some very fine actors about whom, despite the shred of information about each, we learn to care.

Tanner Hall is an all girls (with the exception of the Head Mistress's son Peter as played by Ryan Schira) somewhere in New England: the stately buildings are crumbling just like the lives of the girls who study there. Fernanda (Rooney Mara sans piercings and tattoos!) relates the story by remembering a time in her childhood when her friend Victoria (Georgia King) committed an act of meanness - allowing an old lady's pet parrot to escape.  Hold that thought.

At the school Fernanda, Kate (Brie Larson) and Lucasta (Amy Ferguson0 are best friends and when Victoria is dropped off to yet another new boarding school by her abusive mother she joins the clack. From this point the entries into love, alienation, mischief, decisions about sexuality, and adultery color the fragments of the film.  Gio (Tom Everett Scott) is married and expecting a baby but falls for Fernanda and the two have a challenging relationship.  Lucasta must face her conflict as to her needs and rebuffs physical advances form delivery boy Hank (Shawn Pyfrom), and Kate flirts with teacher Mr. Middleton (Chris Kattan) married to the sex obsessed and frustrated Mrs. Middleton (Amy Sedaris). Victoria is left yearning for the world of relationships to make sense but not finding the path. There is the beginning of a storyline as the girls escape confinement with Victoria's theft of a key, but that eventually goes nowhere except fizzle.

The themes of the film have been used before - and will be used again: girls becoming women is a never ending source of story material.  The aspect that makes this little film shine is the presence of the fine acting of Rooney Mara, Georgia King, Brie Larson, and Amy Ferguson.  They are a pleasure to watch perform.

4860300,5,B005QUQRD8,"We, the 99.9 percent of the world that wasn't in attendance at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, have to consider the recent DVD release of Franny Gregorini and Tatiana von Furstenberg's gal drama, Tanner Hall, the film's public debut. So, despite being a movie filmed in late 2008 and not going public until late 2011, this super stylized drama is a 2011 film, and one of the most surprisingly fulfilling watches we sat for all year.

Staffed with a cast of A-level young talent (led by Rooney Mara, Georgia King and the sizzling Brie Larson), this New England boarding school ensemble flick rolls through scenes with no clear cut story arc, instead playing through as a glimpse into the lives of a group of A-level teen girls going through the way crazy stage of puberty, full blast. Pure fire.

We see details of relationships morphing when the new girl, Victoria (King), arrives and fearlessly stomps her way into the pack or sisters. The crew's soul captain, Fernanda (Mara), is the most powerful and interesting character, and she's brought to life with grace by the Girl With the Dragon Tats herself. It's a performance that could've maybe even been considered legendary, had only Tanner Hall been treated as a major release. Mara's moves are so good that we have to assume this was the film that helped David Fincher find his new discovery.

Imagine if Sophia Coppola rewrote the Little Women script for John Hughes in the late 80s and you'll have a good idea of the haunting appeal that is Tanner Hall. As far as film art and storytelling goes, this is one of the great surprises of 2011. An incredible mix of design, writing and performance. Better late than never.

4860301,5,B005QUQRD8,"this is a coming of age story as 'romeo and juliet' and 'sid and nancy' are both great love stories. It tells a story of a brief time in the lives of four young women. They don't come of age, they deal with their own particular struggles together and lonely and alone. True to life, i felt lucky to be privy to observe their joy and pain in a particularly time of life that is so turbulent and intense for all of us.
I appreciated the absence of cliched hollywood fallbacks like cheap titillation, simple characters and plots, and predictable hollywood endings. these actors did a wonderful job as did the writers. the characters are complex and engrossed me because they were real to me.
i highly recommend this movie and give it five stars. i respect the prior reviewers opinion, just mine is different. i suppose i could be critical too, but i was too busy enjoying watching this film. i hope you enjoy it near as much as i did.",1324166400,3,931,4.4186046511627906

4860313,5,B005QUQRD8,"This movie, though as observed by others, does contain a cliche or two. What I found different about this particular boarding school movie is how each girl is given her own story. They are all discovering their own strengths, weaknesses, limits,and forming their own personalities while away from their families. They rely upon their friends, fool their teachers, get into trouble, and delve into adult situations they believe themselves to be capable of dealing with. There are humorous moments and heart-wrenching ones. You don't have to be a girl to identify with what one of these characters experience.",1430870400,2,607,5.204081632653061

4860315,2,B005QUQRD8,Actors did what  they could with the script they were given. Not enough script background and uses lazy crutch of narration.,1398988800,,124,4.904761904761905
4860316,5,B005QUQRD8,"""Tanner Hall"" is basically ""Wild Child"" meets ""Girl Interrupted"", if you enjoyed ""Cracks"" you should seek out this film.  It is an extremely modest production but the entire budget makes it onto the screen, the four main characters were realistically developed, and the four actresses playing them were well directed. Amy Sedaris plays a secondary character who effectively provides a necessary comic relief,  thereby leaving the four main characters free of something that could have tainted their connections to the viewer.

Fernanda (Rooney Mara) has the standard Winona Ryder part and the storytelling is essentially from her character's point of view, with the same voiceover narration of Ryder's character in ""Girl, Interrupted"".  Rooney's acting has an ephemeral quality that transforms ordinary scenes into something special, perhaps best illustrated by her nonverbal reaction to discovering Victoria alone and crying in the rest room.  The editor explains this through Fernanda's voiceover, but the scene has already communicated Fern's shifting attitude as she processes her unexpected connection with Victoria's vulnerability.

The climatic scene in which Fernanda becomes protective of the bullying Victoria (Georgia King) did not entirely ring true - it was perhaps too extreme - Victoria's mother needed a better build-up.  But I find scenes where a seemingly weaker girl becomes protective of a stronger one to be irresistible, probably become they challenge a viewer's preconceptions.

And challenging viewer preconceptions is what ""Tanner Hall"" is all about.  Like ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", this is a film more about what is happening inside each viewer as they watch the film than about what is actually happening on the screen. Your reaction and the film's entertainment value will have a lot to do with your own experiences at that age or at least your sympathetic awareness of the difficulties that some of your classmates were experiencing. Meaning that if you don't connect and are not mildly blown away by the understated realism, then you and your friends simply weren't dysfunctional enough.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1378684800,,2167,5.400593471810089
4860317,4,B005QUQRD8,"Tanner Hall (2009) was interestingly written by not one, but two women: Tatiana von Furstenberg, the daughter of Diane, and Francesca Gregorini. I serendipitously saw the movie at the 2010 Gen Art Movie Festival here in New York before it won the jury prize for best film.

There were two prominent age-discrepant relationships in the film. In the first part of the clip, boarding school student Victoria (Georgia King) starts part-two of the seduction of her English teacher, Mr. Middlewood (Chris Kattan). In the second part of the clip, Fernanda (Rooney Mara) begins an affair with Gio (Tom Everett Scott), the middle-aged husband of her mother's best friend from college.

I kept watching, hoping for some kind of a redeeming twist or resolution, but there wasn't one.  I know Rooney Mara was nominated for an Oscar for Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and that's wonderful, but she sure does stink in this movie.  Than again, so does everyone else.  Yikes, what a fail.",1351900800,2,422,4.648648648648648
4860320,3,B005QUQRD8,"There have been a fair number of good 'coming of age' flicks but this isn't one of them.

Here's the scoop. A group of friends at an all girl, east coast, boarding school begin their senior year. A new girl is throwing a monkey wrench into the previously secure friendships and all the girls end up a little older in the end.

This movie suffers from a poor script and some bad casting. As far as the script is concerned there is a fair amount of cliche, poor pacing, bad set ups and an overall jumpiness. Victoria is the new kid with the alcoholic mom. She cuts herself, has attempted suicide and wants everyone to be as unhappy as she is. Fernanda is the usually sensible one who ends up in a relationship with an older 'friend of the family.' Lucasta is becoming confused about her sexuality and Kate spends a lot of time teasing a sexually repressed teacher. We've seen this before and none of the characters reaches much above the level of cut-out. Victoria is said to be charismatic but we don't see it. The girls jump to her side and think she's cool way too early in the movie. We don't really see why. The relationship between Fernanda and the adult happens way too fast as well. Nothing actually leads up to the relationship. It's more like he stalks her and uses his adultness to put the move on her. She falls hopelessly in love with him but why? We don't see things develop. Scenes don't flow. They jump from one to another. Too many of them don't flow to the next scene. They just stop.

This IS a good looking film. Shot on the east coast in the fall? What's not to like? And the school has a lot of character. I could have stared at it for hours. The music though barely reaches above generic. The casting had some peculiarities as well. Chis Kattan and Amy Sedaris as a misfit husband and wife are too comic to fit in here. The directing tries to play them only mildly comic but it couldn't be done. I just didn't believe any of this. Maybe if I were a coming of age girl and not an upper middle-aged guy this might dig deeper. But I am what I am and this doesn't ring true.",1348531200,,2091,4.275252525252525
4860321,1,B005QUQRD8,"With due respect to the earlier reviewer, I found this movie thin and uninteresting.

Well, there is I guess with any movie of this type a supposed story line to keep you entertained throughout, but if there was I missed it very early in!
College situ movies need pace and dynamics, none of that here. I need not concern about giving any 'spoiler' as there's not enough substance in the script to enable this. As a TV Soapie I may have been a tad more forgiving.

Fine actors and well photographed in this Blu-ray, but a shame that the presentation didn't live up to the quality.",1341964800,,579,4.452830188679245
