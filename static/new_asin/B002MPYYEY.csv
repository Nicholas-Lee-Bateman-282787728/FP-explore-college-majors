8373982,3,B002MPYYEY,"Although I would definitely not put this movie into the A list of Hong Kong movies I have watched I still found it interesting. The movie takes place during the 1960s-1970s when police corruption, bribery and violence were apparantly rampant within the Hong Kong police force.  It tells about how the British leaders in London decided to crack down on this criminal behavior within the police ranks by establishing the ICAC - Independent Commission Against Corruption and bring about some sanity and professionalism within the police force.  It shows the effects this had on both the mobsters and on the police themselves. I have not seen any other movie tackle this subject of rampant police corruption so that made it both educational and entertaining for me. There is a little too much time spent on a criminal named Gale and his relationship to his nine...yes count them...nine wives when the time could have been better spent on more of the actual police story. That was a somewhat distracting departure from the main story which masqueraded as character development. I thought they could have shown more about how the ICAC developed it's improved interrogation techniques as opposed to their infamous interrogation techniques and how they developed more effective anti crime procedures. The ICAC story was basically too over simpllified in the film. The film does have a lot of violence in it.  Anthony Wong, Tony Leung Ka-Fai and Eason Chan give good performances. It does not go unnoticed that ICAC are the first letters in the title words of the movie I Corrupt All Cops. Recommended for those with an interest in this historically based story of the ICAC.",1341273600,2,1665,4.982014388489208
