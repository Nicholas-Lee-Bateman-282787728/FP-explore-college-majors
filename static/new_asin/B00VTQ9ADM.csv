8711207,5,B00VTQ9ADM,"The Brussels Affair is simply extraordinary. You may well be thinking ""Oh No, not another live Stones album"". Whatever else you get of the Stones have this. Indeed if you were only to own ONE Stones album make it this one. Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor are simply amazing but the whole band is on fire, Keith, on Midnight Rambler, pushing the band to playing it much faster than ""Ya-Ya's"" version.
Why we have been denied this concert for so long is indeed a mystery but don't delay - grab it.
The Marquee Club is very good too, the vision and sound is superlative.",1516665600,,562,4.413461538461538
