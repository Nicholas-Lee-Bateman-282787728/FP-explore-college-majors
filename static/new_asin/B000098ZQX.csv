1881300,5,B000098ZQX,"I run a Community Center in a neighborhood with a lot of horse racing background, and this DVD was a wonderful addition to our Match of the Century Anniversary Party (the race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral)! The actual footage of the 1938 race is amazing!
Well worth the purchase!",1226275200,2,285,4.72
1881301,5,B000098ZQX,"Very nicely done, explains WHY this horse uplifted all of America! Watch this, then watch the movie, if you are so inclined.",1171324800,2,124,4.681818181818182
1881302,4,B000098ZQX,"I found this in a bargain bin, and what a bargain it is!
First of all, the details: This is a single- sided DVD (which is not enhanced for 16X9 viewing) with a single page insert that has a list of chapter stops. There is not a single frame of matted, widescreen, or letterboxed video. And this DVD is not at all any sort of promotion of the Universal dramatic film release of 2003 (and I think there is one mention of the movie that took all of 4 seconds, so it isn't a platform or publicity release). The DVD has a slide show, a ""Seabiscuit Trivia Game,"" and ""Races on the Radio,"" which has lengthy radio broadcasts of some Seabiscuit matches.
I was expecting a lame production, but the producers found some very informative people to give insight into the story. Even the music was better than I expected. It was a mix of period- style music with a dab of modern every now and then, but the music wasn't overbearing.
I still have yet to view the Tobey Maguire movie or any other documentary of this incredible story and was prompted to purchase this while shopping for other items after I saw its price. Honestly, the video doesn't dazzle you with the lighting or recreations (the producers saved some money by simply inserting stock footage of generic horses, jockeys, and races to add additional color) and is by no means an award- winning presentation a la ""Ken Burns"" style. But the DVD is information- rich, which kept me entertained. One really neat item is that narrator J.J. Johnson explains the origion of the phrase, ""So long, Charlie!"" that is so popular.
Those in love with horses or caught by the story of Seabiscuit and the humans that rallied behind him are encouraged to grab this DVD. The staff interviewed people who had direct or indirect knowledge of Seabiscuit, its owners, trainers, or jockeys (so you'll see a good share of talking head segments). But they mix enough footage and archival photos that yield a decent balance for the documentary. There is even some footage of some stars like Bing Crosby, Joe E. Brown, Jimmy Durante, and Lucy and Ricky.
One final note: I tried the trivia game and although it's somewhat elementary (it took me back to memories of the pop quiz in school), its quirkiness was still entertaining. Just check out the reactions the DVD plays when you fail to answer a question correctly. It kinda humbles you when you hear the jeering!",1065398400,52,2389,4.610328638497653

1881307,5,B000098ZQX,"Contrarian Advantage is teasing us with a stock that profits from ""movable pipelines"" that they say may mean we'll never have to approve another old-fashioned pipeline again.

1881308,1,B000098ZQX,"I thought I had ordered the movie, but neglected to use the full title:  ""Seabiscuit the Movie"".  What I got was a weak documentary that only touched on Seabuscuit's career.  It was mainly old interviews with horse people talking about all sorts of unrelated subjects.  Very disappointing.",1369526400,2,289,5.085106382978723

1881310,4,B000098ZQX,"I will have to admit the story of anyone or anything beating the odds and overcoming all of the obstacles life can throw at you, always tugs at my heart strings.  I wished there would have been more actual photos of Seabiscuit but there are still plenty of him to give the viewer a real look at this incredible horse.  I highly recomend this documentary to all horse lovers, and to anyone that just loves an inspirational story.",1301097600,3,428,4.4743589743589745
1881311,3,B000098ZQX,"Some of the product information shown, specifically the production credits, is inaccurate.

According to the credits at the end of ""Seabiscuit - America's Legendary Racehorse,"" this documentary is narrated by J.J. Johnson, directed by Nick Krantz, Oscar Harrison, and Barry Rubinow, produced by Nick Krantz, Oscar Harrison, and Don Blocker (Assistant Producer), and written by Kate Cravens.

Unfortunately, the liner notes do not show any of this information, it can only be verified by actually viewing it, and, because this title is not listed on IMDb (the IMDb link provided takes one to the page for ""Seabiscuit - The Lost Documentary,"" not this title), Amazon will not accept a correction for this listing.

Since Amazon shows the same production credits for both DVDs, I assert the discrepancy between the product information provided by Amazon and the actual content of the DVD is the result of Amazon apparently confusing this documentary with ""The Lost Documentary."" Additionally, of the 41 Customer Reviews that Amazon lists for this product, only eleven of them are actually reviewing ""Seabiscuit - America's Legendary Racehorse,"" the rest are for ""The Lost Documentary."" Of course this can be misleading for buyers who don't notice they are reading a review for a different product.

Since this is not a particularly big seller, I guess Amazon doesn't feel the need for this product page to be either accurate or informative. Too bad, I expected more of Amazon.",1285027200,,1473,5.2025316455696204
1881312,2,B000098ZQX,"I'm a huge fan of documentaries, but this video contains too many scenes of current horse races and interviews with people (who are totally unrelated to the story) about what they thought of Seabiscuit. But on the plus side, the video did contain some facts regarding jockey George Woolf that I found interesting because I've never seen it before in any other related documentary.",1238889600,5,380,4.953125
