8112021,5,B000EOTUVM,"To truly understand those with learning disabilities and the social struggles faced by them, one should really watch this video.  It should be viewed by those in education, counseling, and those who actually suffer from the disorders, as well.  Teachers, parents, relatives, and friends could all learn how to help those who have these disabilities by watching this video, or at least attain a greater and more meaningful understanding of their struggles and their lives by watching it.",1389139200,,486,5.217948717948718
8112022,5,B000EOTUVM,"This is a remarkable presentation with very useful information for all, regardless of whether they are parents, teachers or parents and teachers of `disabled' or `normal' children. The information applies to all.

Dr Lavoie starts with whether schools should teach children social skills. While many may give a negative answer, studies show that it is the social skill deficits that make learning and teaching difficult. Many social skills problems are closely related to particular disabilities (for example, a child with certain learning disabilities does not/will not ask the teacher for help). In a neatly organized program, Dr Lavoie gives short talks on many different problems of learning disabilities. He provides many examples to make his points (example: a learning-disabled child who may be a superb baseball player may not be able to read). He has also kept up with the various studies done on the issue.

The section on Hidden Curriculum- unwritten, unspoken rules, the unique culture specific to each school- is most interesting. The 'average' child understands these rules without being 'taught', but the 'disabled' child does not.

Valuable examples throughout the program open the listeners up to seeing the world from a learning-disabled child's perspective. Without seeing from the child's understanding and perception, a parent, teacher or anyone who deals with the child cannot help the him/her adjust to the world or learn anything.

This program is quite an eye-opener, especially for those who need help and do not know where to turn. The speaker talks too fast at times, which makes it a little hard to follow. But the program menu allows for going back to any section of the lecture.",1331942400,4,1709,5.226277372262774

I highly recommend this for parents or teachers who are new to having or working with children with a learning disability.",1291766400,,262,4.479166666666667
