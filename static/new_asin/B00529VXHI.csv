8453657,1,B00529VXHI,"Do NOT buy this!  If you want to see it, check it out from your library, it's not worth the money.  There was a few things I liked, but for the most part, it is very annoying and not a good video for teaching young children their ABC's.  The part that annoyed me most, was the airplane narrator.  He's cute, but he's so hard to understand with his high-pitched nasal voice.  Unless I was watching the pictures carefully, I had no idea what he was talking about (like when I got up to go to the kitchen, I couldn't understand a word.)  I liked the music, but the intro to the music however, was a loud alarm sound, which I hated.  I liked the pictures of all the animals they had to represent each letter, but when they did the songs, the letters always wiggled.  Cute, but not good for trying to teach children letter recognition. Also, a lot of the animals they had were some from around the world I had never heard of before.  This would have been ok, even make it more interesting and educational, if I could understand what the little airplane was saying about them!  One thing that was good, they spelled out the names of the animals, but some of the animals had very long names, which would be hard for little kids to follow.",1359936000,,1231,4.29004329004329
