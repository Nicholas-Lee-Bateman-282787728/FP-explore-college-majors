8114035,1,B000ESWY6G,"I really didn't care for it.  It was a series of 3 intertwined stories.  I was really hoping for a GLBT movie, not a woe is me in the era of drugs and wild sex.  I didn't watch more then about the first 20 minutes.  I was very bored and gave up on it.",1195171200,,251,3.5925925925925926
8114036,1,B000ESWY6G,"The description makes this film sound fantastic, but it is a train wreck. It is boring as well as offensive. It may not have offended me had it actually been funny, but it was in bad taste and lacked any wit that may have pulled it together. Please don't waste your time or money, this movie is just plain bad.",1188086400,,310,4.183333333333334
8114037,2,B000ESWY6G,"Can anyone tell me what ""The Last Lovers on Earth"" intends to say? It touts itself as a film that ""finally dares to tell the truth."" Well, that long-awaited truth still eludes me.

Is it that gay leaders have done a terrible disservice to gays by acting like clowns? Can you avoid AIDS by not participating in AIDS protests? Is the scientific community out to kill every last gay?

I'm probably suffering from a lack of information here. Knowing how political the AIDS epidemic became--and remains--I may not know enough of the background to understand the film's self-proclaimed ""humor and satire.""
""The Last Lovers on Earth"" presents itself as iconoclastic. But like so many things with iconoclastic intent, it manages only to be recondite, at least for me.

I guess I'm one writer who doesn't get this particular ""writer's film.""",1183680000,3,832,4.928571428571429
8114038,5,B000ESWY6G,"On the cusp between humor and terror, The Last Lovers on Earth brings to fruition the techniques of underground films, Brechtian drama, and the Theater of the Ridiculous.  There are three stories (or parables) told in rotation.  Each makes an incisive point, and the film as a whole makes one huge point -- a simple message, which few gay men have dared to apprehend.  Every element of the film is first-rate: the words of poet Charles Ortleb, the acting, the direction, the original illustrations, the music, and the editing.",1141689600,4,526,4.887640449438202
