8483117,4,B005QBSRNK,"I was impressed by the originality of the plot. The whole Native American curse thing has been done--but not like this. It's a very cool concept, and made for great slasher fun. Lots of gory Native American revenge.",1374969600,,215,4.684210526315789
8483118,4,B005QBSRNK,The Curse of Blanchard Hill really sucked me in. Reminiscent of some of my fave classic horror flicks. I've watched this a couple of times,1374710400,,138,4.56
8483119,4,B005QBSRNK,I'm definitely a fan of a good slasher flick going back to Friday the 13th and all the classics. This has a similar classic to some of those movies with a ghost story kind of vibe. Let the killing begin.,1362441600,,203,4.1
8483120,4,B005QBSRNK,"I really enjoyed this film, as a collector of slasher films i was immediatly drawn in by this really cool DVD cover, i was worried that because the cover was so cool that the film would suck? Thats not the case here, the film is just as good if not better & bloodier then the cover itself. I really felt like I was watching a great slasher film from the heyday it had great pacing a really cool story & terrific gory kills with no cgi which again is a bonus. These were all straight up Tom Savini like Kills none of the gore had to rely on post. Anyways the story is of a group of campers who have a run in with a man who dissapeared 22 yrs ago on Blanchard Hill and are confronted by the man & the Curse, the corpses mount as Nature takes its bloody revenge, I highly recommend this to any slasher & horror fan alike.",1329696000,5,818,4.024539877300613
