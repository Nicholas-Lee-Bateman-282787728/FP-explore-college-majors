3116466,5,B0013LPRTE,I got this because i saw the original many moons ago on public access channel 13 in my old town of N.Y. It was awesome and informant and depressing. Hosted by Mister James Bond himself no not Sean Connery but Roger Moore ( my fav Bond).  Picture quality is pretty bad . they could have ndr it or something to make the picture better but its better than a vhs. Overall I'm pleased.,1288137600,2,380,4.205479452054795
3116467,4,B0013LPRTE,"General overview without a lot of unique details. Seen it all before. However, Audrey Hepburn is a wonderful subject to visit anytime you get the chance. Try to find the A&E Biography version DVD/VHS.",1243987200,7,200,4.911764705882353
3116468,4,B0013LPRTE,"This was a very nice, well put together documentary of Audrey Hepburn.  They have so many of the great people who've worked with her and those who were her close companions.  It's a really nice insight of the great actress through the eyes of her friends/co-stars.  PLUS, there are many interview clips of Audrey Hepburn, herself that I have never seen before.  Audrey never really enjoyed talking about her life, but when she started working with UNICEF, Audrey thought it was a good idea to put herself out in the public so attention will be drawn on UNICEF and the countries they've helped.

Though the clips and interviews with these prominent people are rare and genuine, the quality of the sound and picture fall by the way side.  For this, one star was taken off of my rating, but other than that, great buy.

Recommended to: Audrey Hepburn fans and Gregory Peck fans.",1236643200,29,875,4.6797385620915035

It includes photos of the very young Audrey I have never seen in any of her biographies, as well as reminiscences from her son Sean, former husband Mel, and many who worked with this captivating actress.

Interviews with Audrey herself underscore what a humble and eloquent speaker she was. The documentary clips of her kissing the hands of starving children and their mothers in a Sudanese refugee camp are particularly haunting and heartbreaking.

Everyone who ever met Audrey commented on her kind & generous spirit. Audrey also had good insight regarding her own personality and fame. She never thought she was all that beautiful or that great of an actress. She was very humble. During a great portion of her later life, Audrey was an ambassador for UNICEF. Audrey knew that her fame allowed her to bring the work of UNICEF into the public eye.

3116848,5,B0013LPRTE,"Where do I start about this amazing woman who enchanted the world from her first feature film ""Holiday in Rome"" with Gregory Peck, who foresaw her winning the Oscar for this part and also demanded the studio give her equal billing. This show covers from her birth just outside of Brussels to living through World War II and going to school in Arnhem, Netherlands and the life she lived there under the Nazi's and then post-WWII famine relief guided her UNICEF work in her later years and of course, her professional career.

This documentary is filled with interviews of her co-stars, directors, friends and family that clearly show her Joie de vivre. I chose this French phrase that means cheerful enjoyment of life; an exultation of spirit, because that is what clearly come through in this show. It is amazing to see how she has this natural grace, even in the small parts she played in the few movies she made prior to ""Holiday in Rome"". It never left her either. One of her director's states, ""It was like she was kissed on the cheek by God when born"".  Amazing.

It also reveals the non-movie star side of her. Her two marriages and a long partnership that lasted to the end of her life.  Mel Ferrer, her first husband speaks of her with love for her still in his voice and her final partner, Robert Wolders, also talks of their time together and with her children.  Although, her second husband, Andrea Dotti, who was living while this show was made, doesn't make an appearance here, a Google search of him will explain why.

Roger Moore, who is the host, obviously has great affection for her and her memory. Consequently, he leads us through the life of this beautiful, funny, charming and most of all, loving person.

I believe this is a must see for all movie enthusiasts or anybody else that knows and understands the meaning of LOVE.",1373155200,,1846,4.609756097560975

I had seen the show on PBS and knew the young lady should like it. And she did! Quite a lot of black/white film of Audrey as a young girl, her family, early career. And I'm old enough to know that I don't think this material was widely available in the actual lifetime of Ms. Hepburn.

3116854,4,B0013LPRTE,"There's only ever been one Audrey Hepburn.  This documentary, completed with the support of Hepburn's partner Robert Wolders and narrated by Roger Moore, presents a very intimate remembrance of the movie star who was every bit as beautiful on the inside as she ever was on the screen.

Hepburn starred in some of the great Hollywood romances (""Sabrina"", ""Funny Face"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and her Academy Award-winning triumph, ""Roman Holiday""); but the woman behind the screen was just as fascinating.  Enduring the horrific German occupation of Holland during WW2, Hepburn and her mother moved to London after the liberation, where Audrey learned that too much precious time had been lost, and she'd never fulfil her dream to become a classical ballet dancer.

Acting really just fell into her lap.  Minor roles in several British films (including ""The Lavender Hill Mob"") led to director William Wyler plucking her almost from out of the blue to co-star opposite Gregory Peck in ""Roman Holiday"".  Almost at the same time, she enjoyed two hits on the Broadway stage (""Gigi"", ""Ondine"", the latter earning Hepburn a Tony Award).  The rest, as they say, is history.  In retrospect it seems incredible that she even made it at all!  She wasn't Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Sophia Loren or Elizabeth Taylor.  But she was magic all the same.  And audiences adored her.

This documentary is filled with clips from many of her fondly-regarded hits (and a few rarities) plus insights from those who knew Hepburn best (friend Connie Wald, son Sean Ferrer, director Stanley Donen and former husband Mel Ferrer chief among them).  A ""loverly"" reminder of what true movie magic is all about...and why we're all still head-over-heels in love with Audrey Hepburn.

Hosted by Mister James Bond himself no not Sean Connery but Roger Moore ( my fav Bond).  Picture quality is pretty bad . they could have ndr it or something to make the picture better but its better than a vhs. Overall I'm pleased.,1288137600,2,380,4.205479452054795

3350965,4,B0013LPRTE,"This was a very nice, well put together documentary of Audrey Hepburn.  They have so many of the great people who've worked with her and those who were her close companions.  It's a really nice insight of the great actress through the eyes of her friends/co-stars.  PLUS, there are many interview clips of Audrey Hepburn, herself that I have never seen before.  Audrey never really enjoyed talking about her life, but when she started working with UNICEF, Audrey thought it was a good idea to put herself out in the public so attention will be drawn on UNICEF and the countries they've helped.

Though the clips and interviews with these prominent people are rare and genuine, the quality of the sound and picture fall by the way side.  For this, one star was taken off of my rating, but other than that, great buy.

Recommended to: Audrey Hepburn fans and Gregory Peck fans.",1236643200,29,875,4.6797385620915035

Interviews with Audrey herself underscore what a humble and eloquent speaker she was. The documentary clips of her kissing the hands of starving children and their mothers in a Sudanese refugee camp are particularly haunting and heartbreaking.

3351345,5,B0013LPRTE,"Where do I start about this amazing woman who enchanted the world from her first feature film ""Holiday in Rome"" with Gregory Peck, who foresaw her winning the Oscar for this part and also demanded the studio give her equal billing. This show covers from her birth just outside of Brussels to living through World War II and going to school in Arnhem, Netherlands and the life she lived there under the Nazi's and then post-WWII famine relief guided her UNICEF work in her later years and of course, her professional career.

This documentary is filled with interviews of her co-stars, directors, friends and family that clearly show her Joie de vivre. I chose this French phrase that means cheerful enjoyment of life; an exultation of spirit, because that is what clearly come through in this show. It is amazing to see how she has this natural grace, even in the small parts she played in the few movies she made prior to ""Holiday in Rome"". It never left her either. One of her director's states, ""It was like she was kissed on the cheek by God when born"".  Amazing.

It also reveals the non-movie star side of her. Her two marriages and a long partnership that lasted to the end of her life.  Mel Ferrer, her first husband speaks of her with love for her still in his voice and her final partner, Robert Wolders, also talks of their time together and with her children.  Although, her second husband, Andrea Dotti, who was living while this show was made, doesn't make an appearance here, a Google search of him will explain why.

Roger Moore, who is the host, obviously has great affection for her and her memory. Consequently, he leads us through the life of this beautiful, funny, charming and most of all, loving person.

I believe this is a must see for all movie enthusiasts or anybody else that knows and understands the meaning of LOVE.",1373155200,,1846,4.609756097560975

I had seen the show on PBS and knew the young lady should like it. And she did! Quite a lot of black/white film of Audrey as a young girl, her family, early career.

3351351,4,B0013LPRTE,"There's only ever been one Audrey Hepburn.  This documentary, completed with the support of Hepburn's partner Robert Wolders and narrated by Roger Moore, presents a very intimate remembrance of the movie star who was every bit as beautiful on the inside as she ever was on the screen.

Hepburn starred in some of the great Hollywood romances (""Sabrina"", ""Funny Face"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and her Academy Award-winning triumph, ""Roman Holiday""); but the woman behind the screen was just as fascinating.  Enduring the horrific German occupation of Holland during WW2, Hepburn and her mother moved to London after the liberation, where Audrey learned that too much precious time had been lost, and she'd never fulfil her dream to become a classical ballet dancer.

Acting really just fell into her lap.  Minor roles in several British films (including ""The Lavender Hill Mob"") led to director William Wyler plucking her almost from out of the blue to co-star opposite Gregory Peck in ""Roman Holiday"".  Almost at the same time, she enjoyed two hits on the Broadway stage (""Gigi"", ""Ondine"", the latter earning Hepburn a Tony Award).  The rest, as they say, is history.  In retrospect it seems incredible that she even made it at all!  She wasn't Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Sophia Loren or Elizabeth Taylor.  But she was magic all the same.  And audiences adored her.

This documentary is filled with clips from many of her fondly-regarded hits (and a few rarities) plus insights from those who knew Hepburn best (friend Connie Wald, son Sean Ferrer, director Stanley Donen and former husband Mel Ferrer chief among them).  A ""loverly"" reminder of what true movie magic is all about...and why we're all still head-over-heels in love with Audrey Hepburn.

A great companion documentary for A&E Biography's ""The Fairest Lady"", which is available on the DVD for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Steal-a-Million/dp/B0002B15YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Steal a Million</a>.",1298678400,17,2027,5.496774193548387

8251872,5,B0013LPRTE,"Of course I knew who Audrey Hepburn the ""movie star"" actress was, but I didn't know much about her beyond her classics like Breakfast at Tiffany's. After watching this doc, I felt compelled to write a review to express how moved I was by the legacy she left behind, her dedication to UNicef, & the selfless way she seemed to engage herself. A role model for all, especially the celebrity, who has the power and position to make a difference, effect change, and use influence for a greater cause, other than one's own ego.
A beautiful example of what it means to be a mother, role model, and exemplary human being. Generous, selfless, creative...",1505433600,,645,4.666666666666667

She was a lovely, elegant lady and it was inspiring that when she became older she chose to use her fame to improve the lives of children. The only negative about this documentary was that I knew a few facts about Audrey that I didn't see in this presentation.  Otherwise, very good.",1486339200,,402,4.493150684931507
