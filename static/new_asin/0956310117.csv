A good thing is that for sure you sweat doing this, but is not that you learn nothing you couldn't invent by your self ...",1350432000,,272,4.150943396226415
172296,4,0956310117,"This is a very tough workout. Prepare to sweat...a lot, and prepare to be very sore. Ibuprofen will be your friend. This is not a workout I can do everyday. I'm 40 and in pretty decent shape, but I have to take a day off, at least, in between workouts. I've been attempting Yan's beginning Qi Gong on ""off"" days with this video. I can feel my body changing for the better. My lung capacity seems to have gotten better, and I seem more limber.

I would give this video 5 stars (a perfect rating), but my only real criticism is that the people doing the workout are facing the camera. It makes it difficult to perform the combinations. In a classroom setting, I would be facing the same way as the people in the workout. In this video's scenario left is right and right is left; this gets difficult when the turns happen. Have your remote nearby and use slow-motion.

Overall, this video will whip you into shape and give you a more powerful punch and kick.",1325462400,3,955,4.359550561797753
172297,5,0956310117,"This is my second time working out using this DVD.  Im very impressed by this DVD By Shifu Yan Lei.  I honestly recommend this DVD ( Shaolin Warrior - Workout - Vol 1 - Beginners ) to anyone looking to get a nice workout in, and learn some basic punches, Martial Art stances - positions - Poses.  On this DVD there will be some stop, and go, as you transition from one move to the next set up of moves.  I'm glad Shifu Yan Lei did have some breaks here, and there so I could re,gain my composure - breath.  This DVD just like a lot of Workout DVD's you can make it as intense as you need it to be, based on your level of Health, and Fitnes.  This was a excellent buy for me.  Also when I buy DVD's I go to other Sources Like Utube so I can get a pretty good Idea if I can feel safe buying a particular DVD, or product.",1323734400,10,818,3.8622754491017965
172298,5,0956310117,"I've been training with Crossfit's programming on or around the prescribed workout of the day for over two years and this Qigong workout is great.  They focus on all body weight exercises (which I love, because it is very hard to injure yourself with them) and the movements have a built in dynamic stretch to them.  Since I've been doing it, my pistol squats have become easier and my hips are far more flexible (adductors in particular).  If you do these routines, then you will have an overall better feeling mentally as well as physically.",1311724800,15,543,4.6947368421052635
172299,3,0956310117,"Putting the word ""Beginners"" in the title is somewhat misleading. Unless you already have experience in martial arts or you have a lot of patience and DVD player with slow motion, it becomes extraordinarily frustrating trying to follow along with most of program. It's possible he may be a good teacher in real life, for the most part he is incapable of teaching by video. The simple moves and stretches are easy to follow, but they would be easy to follow by mimicking anyone doing them. The more complex moves are typically done one time at about half speed (which is still quite hard to follow for someone unfamiliar with the moves) and then he will typically stand off to the side while he has his students perform the movement a few times at a speed that is even harder to follow. In my opinion, a DVD for beginners should be primarily focused on teaching each movement thoroughly so the student can learn to execute each with good form. With this DVD you receive almost no instruction and can only hope your attempt to copy the movement is correct.
The program is also filmed completely from the front. This makes it very difficult to learn the moves as you are face to face with the person doing them, rather than facing the same direction as you would if the moves were also shown from the back (picture being face to face with someone... their left side is on your right and vice versa). This creates a situation where you are trying to follow along with a move that is already not explained well and you also have to do everything with the ""opposite"" side of the body.
I still gave it 3 stars because about half the moves are simple enough to copy right away and as far as a workout goes, the pacing is good for a beginner.",1306454400,15,1733,4.435736677115988
172300,5,0956310117,I like the exercises and it is a good extension to the first one. I plan on purchasing the third DVD in this series. thanks!,1303776000,2,124,4.0
172301,5,0956310117,"On reviewer wrote, ""If you have any fundamentals in martial arts, you might not find this DVD set all that useful."" For what I ask? This is Kung Fu and not exactly the same stuff in forms as the rest of MAs. Now if you want to begin learning authentic Shaolin from a Sifu who is the real deal in your own living room, I have seen none better. The is the beginner workout, and it's not easy at all. It's a fairly lengthy workout that is practically non-stop. The Sifu does some warm ups, works on stamina, some forms, (the forms will really help for the uncoordinated, BTW) just about the right amount of stretching to be able to do this workout without injury (hey. you can work on serious flexibility at another time. It's not necessary to spend too much time here), some basic punches and kicks, and a little Chi Gong at the end to cool and calm down. As far as the workout, I can virtually guarantee you (I am not a shill, BTW and this is an honest review) that if you are out of shape or have too much body fat, if you do this workout say three times a week and watch your diet (that's another topic which you need to master) you will be buff, yes buff. This is how demanding this workout is. So I agree to learn some basic Shaolin Kung Fu and to get into shape, this is a great DVD. As far as street fighting for self defense, no you won't be a great fighter, but you sure as heck will be better off by being in shape, more flexible, and with a more powerful kick and punch than you had before. Besides, this is just the beginning, not the end. To summarize: if you want to build your stamina, be more flexible, get coordinated, and get buff, this is a great session. Buy this video. This is the real deal, the stuff you see the actual Shaolin practitioners doing when you watch those you-tube vids of them doing workouts at the temple. This is supposed to be the easiest of the three Warrior Workouts. He also has a series called Boot-camp which is supposed to be harder than the advanced session in this series! I hate to see that one even the beginner session.

[Edit 2/8/2012: I have heard that some have said this DVD is too hard. Well, yes, it is hard, but you do not have to do the whole thing at each session. Perhaps you are not flexible, are overweight, or you have weak knees or legs. These things are just typical. You can start by practicing a horse stance building up your time in the stance for leg strength. Begin with 20 seconds and add a few seconds a week (or even four a day or four every other day. Do this stance once in the morning and once in the evening or night. I guarantee you will notice your muscles in your upper leg, leg strength improvement, and it getting easier in just a couple weeks time. While doing this work on your flexibility. At the same time maybe you can do just the warm-up, stamina training, and Chi Gong of the DVD. This by itself is a fairly decent workout using just three sections. Also do some walking during the week and perhaps some light jog/walk once a week. Not too much you may hurt your knees if you are too heavy and not used to jogging. Then when you get to your proper weight add some more sections (or one at a time). As far as diet I recommend this book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-RAVE-Diet-Lifestyle-3rd-Edition/dp/0972659064/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The RAVE Diet & Lifestyle - 3rd Edition</a>.

It tells you everything you need to know to eat healthy and lose weight. It's a vegetarian diet which is far superior to any other kind. R= no refined foods, A= no animal products, V= no vegetable oils, E= no exceptions and exercise. There is also a DVD called ""Eating"" by the same author.  I recommend aiming for 3 pounds a week until you reach your proper weight. Make a log. You will learn what it takes to lose two to three pounds a week by getting to know your body. There are calculators on the Internet that will tell you how much you should weigh and give a range. They are general but pretty good in most cases. Just losing the weight will make many of the exercises and forms much easier to accomplish. Imagine how much easier just a horse stance will be after losing say 40-50 pounds. Most people are at least 30 pounds overweight. Another great book from a Buddhist perspective (don't get hung up on the word Buddhist. The stuff will not contradict your mainstream religion except in a few sentences perhaps and you can just ignore those parts if you come across any. It will actually reinforce your religion in practice and actually tell you how to use your mind to do it instead of just saying ""don't do this-do that"")is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savor-Mindful-Eating-Mindful-Life/dp/0061697702/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life</a>.]

[Edit March 5, 2012: I would also add these two great books by Dr. Joel Fuhrman&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eat-to-Live-The-Amazing-Nutrient-Rich-Program-for-Fast-and-Sustained-Weight-Loss-Revised-Edition/dp/031612091X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eat to Live: The Amazing Nutrient-Rich Program for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss, Revised Edition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Immunity-The-Essential-Nutrition-Guide-for-Boosting-Your-Body-s-Defenses-to-Live-Longer-Stronger-and-Disease-Free/dp/0062080636/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Immunity: The Essential Nutrition Guide for Boosting Your Body's Defenses to Live Longer, Stronger, and Disease Free</a>. Both in the same vein as the RAVE Diet. Many of the recipes are great in these books.] These two books are a little more flexible than the RAVE diet, but generally the same kind of approach to food. I recommend reading all three.

Good luck. Well, you really don't need any luck, just the intent. Yes, it will take time but just stick with these things. You will be richly rewarded with a healthy body and peace of mind. Rome was not built in a day. And if you just can't take the diet 100% all the time, by all means treat yourself to a cheat meal a week, but don't over do it.",1302998400,65,6197,4.995159728944821
172302,4,0956310117,"I have a black belt and this was a little more than beginner level.  Anyone can attempt the moves, but as far as correctly executing them...that's another story...it's fun to do, and I really enjoy the teacher's passion!",1302566400,3,220,4.7894736842105265
172303,5,0956310117,This is a great starting point for beginners in Shaolin. Yan Lei is a good teacher and one would find it hard to find a more authentic Shaolin workout than his teachings.,1300579200,,170,4.34375
172304,3,0956310117,"If you have any fundamentals in martial arts, you might not find this DVD set all that useful. I have many years of experience in martial arts both as a student and as an instructor.

This DVD series was created to simulate a classroom setting. Learning in a classroom and learning from a DVD are different. In DVD workouts, the instructor must be working out WITH the viewer so the viewer can receive correct visual feedback immediately. Some would say the students in this DVD set serve that purpose. The students in the DVD don't offer consistent correct feedback. Again, this is DVD learning.

A good example of proper DVD instruction is Shawn T's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insanity/dp/B002QZ1RS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insanity</a>&nbsp;workout program. For the most part, Shawn does the entire workout with the viewer so the viewer can always watch him and use him as the standard for how a technique should be executed for each workout. He has others who follow but he sets the standard and you can always get the feedback you need immediately.

Unfortunately, in this DVD set you get classroom instruction rather than DVD instruction so you will need to become fast at running back the DVD a few frames to get to the short, proper instruction and visual feedback you need to be successful.

The instructor in this DVD set is really good. No question. I would have preferred that he perform every repetition with his students.

Anyhow, if you want to learn some basic movements and just get doing something physical, this will help. Heck anything will help. If you're looking for more than basics this DVD set might not be for you.

If I could do it all over again, I would have put the $70+ towards a good set of Thai Pads instead.",1295568000,12,1792,4.996644295302014

172313,4,0956310117,"Well, Shifu Yan Lei will not get the giggly, bouncy, bubbly instructor award of the year.  He is very serious and VERY good at what he does.  I am a bona fide beginner and this workout was a little over my head (speed-wise).  I think this workout would be a bit more beneficial to those with some Kung Fu experience; there is not a lot of step by step break down of the moves.  He announces a movement (his English is very broken), he demonstrates once or twice (he's really amazing!), and then the students take off like whirlwinds.  I think over time (with a lot of pausing and reviewing) I can make it through the combinations.  I really liked the stretching segment (toward the end of the workout).  He gave a lot of modification advice for those of us whose joints have not reached the consistency of spaghetti.  He also gave a lot of breaks between each set of exercises (punches, kicks, forms), so my heart rate never stayed up.  It's really going to take patience on the beginner's part to slowly learn the footwork and hand placement if you are not coordinated or already knowledgeable in Kung Fu.

Even for a beginner of Martial Arts, this instructional video is easy to follow [clear audio and visual instruction], adaptable to your physical fitness level and level of flexibility, and you can see benefits early on in your training [if you exert yourself with some level of effort].

I also find his blog posts very helpful [ [...]].  In them he gives additional insights to assist your training, and to encourage you along the way.  With the workouts, it is a good 1-2 punch.
