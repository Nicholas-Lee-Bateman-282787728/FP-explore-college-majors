2299108,1,B0009KQP6Y,This is the kind of movie you watch and think... I can't believe people actually put time and money into this movie... certainly there is no talent.  Even more unbelievable is that it was ever picked up and released...Wow... slap a good lookin alien on the cover and hope for the best... Avoid this waiste of time and ...... well time,1122076800,13,334,4.475409836065574
2299109,1,B0009KQP6Y,"I bought this dvd cause the cover's alien was extremely similar to the alien in the original Alien movies. BIG MISTAKE. L.Lamas was in this movie for may be 10 mins. tops. The Alien is nothing like the photo on the cover and it, of course is nothing like the Alien movies. The cover said a ""new breed of predator"" This movie is the stupidist movie I have ever seen. IT IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MY MONEY AND MY TIME. !!! If there was a way to do it - I would rate it in the minus ( - ) instead of the + column ...SO DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE...",1120867200,16,549,3.824561403508772
2299110,1,B0009KQP6Y,"I thought that there isn't a movie out there that can make me truly hate it so much that I can get off my seat and leave. But this movie did. Within the first 15 minutes of bad acting, cheesy gore, very bad CGI and crappy dialogue I couldn't continue watching it. It is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I thought nothing would change my opinion after M. Night's Signs. But it did. Don't waste your 5 bucks renting it.",1120867200,8,422,4.096385542168675
2299111,1,B0009KQP6Y,"this movie seriously stinks, spend 90 minutes of your life doing something else,  riding your bike or reading a book, even listening to Clay Aiken or Celine Dion is more pleasurable. First this movie has no connection with the ""Alien"" movies. The story makes little sense, the alien is about as scary as anyone on the WWE. The actors go from intense overacting (the Phoebe character esp.) to not acting at all (Lorenzo Lamas and anyone in the OPI). The only redeeming portion of the movie is the beginning there is actually some nudity that is interesting, but it goes downhill as soon as they enter the cave and find the treasure. I found myself watching it with spanish subtitles to justify wasting my time on it (I was at least keeping up with my spanish). If I had to choose between this movie and having to stand in leech infested water, I would choose the leeches",1120867200,13,869,4.535031847133758
2299112,1,B0009KQP6Y,"Horrible, a definte C movie! Lorenzo Lamas must really be desperate for work! The alien is so fake looking and the action scenes are totaly fake looking! The only thing that was decent is the killing, it is real graphic! The acting really sucks in it! If you like gore than get this movie for a good laugh!",1120608000,2,306,4.293103448275862
2299113,1,B0009KQP6Y,"WTF is this?

The monster is just a crossed eye powerranger reject.

And the interview with the ""monster"" was so lame.. whoever was involed into making this movie should be publically guillotined.",1180742400,2,196,5.09375
2299114,1,B0009KQP6Y,"I can't believe I actually spent my hard earned money on this DVD (even though it was on sale for four bucks).  I figured seeing Lorenzo Lamas and Priscilla Barnes' names, it might be entertaining.  Wrong!  Based on the lousy acting, special effects (if you can even call it that) and story (or lack, thereof), the people who made this DVD must have made their money back from all the suckers (me included) who wasted their time and money on buying it.

The plot was so ridiculous!  An invisible alien is hiding in a cave in the mountains guarding (or eating?!?) a cache of gold treasure and swords!!!  Of course, when the alien starts killing people, a secret government agency starts to investigate.  For whatever reason, a team of the most un-mercenary-like mercenaries (including a punk rock/goth girl!) are called into to assist.  Apparently just wearing mismatched camo pattern clothes makes you a mercenary.

There's a gratuitous sex scene between the punk rock/goth merc girl and some middle aged mercenary.  As a typical, red-blooded American guy, I like gratuitous sex scenes.  But this one was so pathetically bad, I actually felt embarrassed for those actors.

What made this movie even worse was the fact that the B-list actors (Lamas and Barnes) didn't even interact with the other unknown actors, except in one short scene.  It was like filming two separate movies and then piecing them together to get this mess.  Ugh!

I'm sure there are a lot of worse movies than this one but Alien 3000 definitely should get ""honorable"" mention with them.",1180656000,,1558,4.870722433460076
2299115,1,B0009KQP6Y,"I bought this DVD sight unseen because I love Horror/Sci-Fi and it read good on the box.

It took me three different attempts to view this tripe.  Every time I sat down to watch it, I turned it off and did something else!  The dialogue was horrendous.  It is the usual crappy, horney, gut-ripping, rubber monster stuff which is just an insult to anyone who is looking for a good scare.  And what's with the team leader keeping that disgusting hateful psychotic woman on the team?  Who would trust such a person?  Just goes to show you what a crappy script this is.

I can't convey to you how bad this thing is except to say, LOOK AT ALL THE 1-STAR RATINGS IT GOT!",1179014400,,663,4.290322580645161
2299116,2,B0009KQP6Y,"This movie would have been not bad if it was 30 minutes long...

What we have here is the right ingredients but not the right formula.

We have pretty good gore, a monster...not too bad of a rubber suit, and

so so actors.  I knew the film was in trouble when we had close up breast

shots at the beginning...that lasted a bit too long.

......and why after pumping a million bullets in this creature,,,the actors are still shooting at it....

as you see there are problems....and before the end of the film ...you

will probably shut your dvd player off.....to spare you more pain...",1160956800,2,584,4.495238095238095
2299117,1,B0009KQP6Y,"The movie is a good idea but like its prequal ""unseen evil"" the production and DVD value is incredibly low. Poor filming and horrid script made it a film that not-even cable will show again. The story is a survivor of the first film is contracted by the government to work with mercenaries to find and capture this alien entity. First, last i checked the US government has no need to contract mercenaries, we have the largest and most trained army in the world. The second thing i found really annoying is the aliens shape. We see about three different body-suits used for the alien and its cloaking is a bad omage of the predator movies. All in all the film was to bad for me to completly finish as it was to agonizing and the DVD picture quality and sound was below an awful bootleg.",1158364800,,785,4.383561643835616
2299118,1,B0009KQP6Y,"I just bought this movie for cheap at my local video store previously viewed. Should have known there was a reason for the $3.99 price tag!! The only ""good"" thing about this movie, if you can call it good b/c the blood was so fake looking, were the gory killing scenes. Other than that, it' a cheap and poorly acted movie! Plot: mutilated bodies are suddenly found outside a cave in the woods and the  military is sent to find out who or what is killing these people. Stupid plot that tries to be a combination between Alien and Predator. Boy do they have a long way to go to even come close to either film. Please don't waste your money on this movie!!!!!!!!",1143244800,3,659,4.314516129032258
2299119,1,B0009KQP6Y,"This is the type of horror movie they made back in the old days. i.e. low budget, bad acting, guy in a fake looking rubber monster suit. The concepts for this movie were likely copied from Alien, Predator, and Independence day. The DVD cover's alien looks similar to the creature from the Alien movies, however the actual movie's alien looks different from the DVD cover. The alien can become invisible like the creature from Predator. One scene was obviously copied from Independence day (the alien has it's tentacle around the dead scientists neck, making the scientist's body say ""...r e l e a s e... m e...""). Perhaps the alien may have been more believable if it had been filmed under dim lighting conditions, however views of the alien were in full daylight making it obviously a badly designed fake rubber monster suit.

The special features consists of an interview with the director who is wearing a rubber monster mask. I guess I would also hide my face if I were involved with making this movie.",1130112000,3,1006,4.715909090909091
2299120,3,B0009KQP6Y,"I think the people who give this movie a bad review are missing the point.  It stars Lorenso Lamas and went straight to DVD, so of course the plot is bad and the effects are horrible, but that's part of the charm.  Everything about this movie, from the acting, to the effects to the plot, to everthing else are bad, that it's fun to watch.  If you like to do MST3K at home, you will like this movie.  If you want to watch Aliens, then skip this and just watch Aliens.",1128988800,3,467,4.0989010989010985
2299121,1,B0009KQP6Y,"Halfway through this horrendous clunker, you may realize it's actually a sequel to the equally bad UNSEEN EVIL.  (I had the misfortune of seeing that one, too, so I knew when the flashbacks occurred, I was in for trouble).  Lorenzo Lamas, looking seriously bored and only in the movie for about 10 minutes, is pretty bad, but the rest of the cast is worse.  The effects are some of the worst I've seen recently and the screenwriter is one of those who thinks that every character must have at least three profanities in his dialogue.  You may recognize Priscilla Barnes as the mysterious doctor, and you may wonder if she wants you to recognize her!  The movie is filled with unlikeable characters and the few good ones are offed.  Nothing like the cover suggests, so beware dear viewer!",1126742400,7,787,4.666666666666667

8062741,3,B0009KQP6Y,"Most people are quite familiar with the pony-tailed B legend known as Lorenzo Lamas. Whether you want to admit it or not, you've probably enjoyed one of his classic works at some point in life. The man launched his career in the 90's as an action powerhouse, most notably as Reno Raines in the uber B show Renegade, and has never looked back. When you have such a successful B action career you tend to get a bit restless. The non stop neck snappings, explosions, and stables of women can become tiresome. This could be the one reason Lorenzo decided to branch out and sign himself up for a journey into the world of sci-fi with Alien 3000. Now to be clear, this movie was about as horrible as any movie could possibly be. The creature on the cover has nothing to do with the alien in the movie. Maybe they casted the aliens more B brother instead because this thing was hilarious. The only reason this earned a three star rating was in honor of the mighty Lorenzo and a cameo that even we were not prepared for. When Scott Schwartz, Flick from a Christmas Story, showed up on the screen we almost lost our minds! The man was a better actor at 10 years old with his tongue stuck to a telephone pole.  What's even more funny is remembering his did a few adult films back in the 90's, which added an even larger dose of B to the already nightmarish film.

Alien 3000 opens up with some peep freak with binoculars checking out a chicks rack. Seriously they opened up the movie with nudity...which is something Sid from 94 would have been thrilled about. Not only did they open with it but it lasts for a good 35 seconds. This was their way of letting you know this movie is going to be horrendous. After some rackage we follow this crew of flunkies into a cave where they stumble upon a bunch of gold. Instead of the gold being protected by a little Irish maniac, it's protected by one of the cheapest CGI aliens anyone could create. When they try to take its gold the creature chops everyone in half. This now leads to a girl in a mental institution that has visions of this aliens killings, gathers up a team of even bigger losers, and heads out to stop this alien. We're not sure where Lorenzo really comes into play, but he's seen at the start and end of the movie. He plays an army guy that winds up having a sword fight with the alien. None of this makes any sense and is actually quite challenging to even attempt to explain. Bottom line is the movie is horrific and as confused as Santa on the toilet when a slow fellow opens the stall door.

Alien 3000 could easily have been created on a $50 budget with the actors being paid in Big Uns. The cast, except for Lamas and Flick, seemed as if they'd never been involved in any form of acting. It's almost like they all randomly showed up and were asked ""hey do you want to be in a movie?"" You could even tell by Lamas's face that he couldn't believe he was involved in this nightmare. And considering his resume, that's pretty disturbing. The acting was actually nowhere near as horrid as the special effects. Most of the time the alien was invisible with a slight outline, similar to Predator...just lacking any level creativeness. It was like a mentally challenged version of predator. When the alien was materialized it was pretty hilariously cheap. But leaps and bounds above the CGI version. We can't advice you spend any time watching Alien 3000, but we will dare you. In fact we triple dog dare you!",1341014400,,3459,4.393135725429017
8062742,4,B0009KQP6Y,"I know what many will say: ""4 stars?  Is he nuts?""  Well, allow me to explain.  Alien 3000 (aka Unseen Evil 2) is by no means a good movie.  Its cast is comprised of inept no-names poorly delivering badly written lines.  The story is nonsensical, being hacked together bits of established Sci-Fi movie tropes.  Bits of The X-files, Aliens, Predator and who knows what else have all been mashed together in a movie that contains Government Agents, ""Green Berets,"" a traumatized survivor of an alien attack, and the worst gang of Mercenaries ever assembled. The effects are worthy of the bargain-bin and the cinematography is, frankly, bush league.  This looks like a half-hearted student film, released by a college freshman with next to no budget and filmed in probably two locations.  Heck, the Alien on the cover is actually from another film, and has nothing to do with this one!  So why do I give it 4 stars?

Because, dear reader, this movie is absolutely awesome!  It's everything hilarious that a purveyor of trashy sci-fi/horror films could ask for.  What's there to enjoy?  The combination of over and under-acting provides a treasure trove of one-liners and inside jokes to share with your friends.  The first couple of minutes of the film include a completely gratuitous flash of breasts.  Over the top blood and gore transform what should seem tragic (maybe) into a series of sight gags and ""what will they do next?"" moments.  A hero named McCool who wields a toy machine gun.  It's a joy to watch a film that includes little toy helicopters, Tonka(TM) trucks and cardboard box buildings masquerading as the real thing.  Lorenzo-Freaking-Lamas.  Seriously, this movie has it all.  If you're the kind of person that enjoys laughing AT a film instead of With one, you have no reason not so see this.

Make no mistake, this is a D-grade piece of straight-to-video crap, but the entertainment value is through the roof.",1298419200,4,1927,4.8496932515337425
8062743,1,B0009KQP6Y,"I bought this to see an acquaintence's brief moment on camera as he attempted to make it as an actor. Luckily he got zapped after about 30 seconds. The other ""actors"" lived long enough to ruin any chance of a further career.  This is apparently a home-made video for 12 year olds......just kidding, but it IS amateurish beyond belief.  The Alien ""special effects"" are ludicrous.  I did get a couple of disbelief laughs in the beginning but then it was too stupid to finish.",1283299200,,473,4.607142857142857
8062744,5,B0009KQP6Y,"Clearly many of the reviewers did not realize that this was a B movie. As such, the ratings (if you go in for B movies) have to be adjusted accordingly. As a B movie, I give it 5 stars. If I were to grade it on the quality I would expect from an A list movie, I would have to give it less than 1 star. But lets be realistic here folks, buying a movie just because the picture on the box is reminiscent of an A list movie, does not ""ever"" make the movie a great or even good movie. This is schlock at its best. FX are not so bad for a B movie. Yes, the only two recognizable names in the movie have less than stellar parts, heck even somewhat limited parts. To be honest, I never realized Priscilla Barns could look so bad. And, I used to have a crush on her. Well, if you were married to the person I was married to at the time, you would understand. But, I digress, and I do now have a wonderful wife. The funny thing about this movie is, that it's a sequel to a movie called ""Unseen Evil"" also of poor quality. With a very similar plot-line ""If you see the beast you are already dead."" This story picks up with the one lone survivor of the first movie in a nut-hutch etc. Sound familiar, it should, it's been done in many horror movies in the past. So,if  you like B list movies, poor FX, and you know what you are getting when you buy this, you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you prefer a higher class of loser as Garth sings, then stay away from this movie.

8062745,5,B0009KQP6Y,"I have to say that enjoying this type of movie requires an enquired taste.  I have seen many types of films in my day, from Hollywood, mainstream, independent, low budget or whatever.  As a matter of fact in my college days I used to make movies (not those types of movies) and did freelanced work with film/video.  Therefore I feel I am able to appreciate a good movie or a bad movie.  Please don't mistake me, just because I use to work with video/film doesn't mean I have a better taste than others, this is just my excuse for loving schlock. :)

With this introduction taken into consideration, I have to say that ""Alien 3000"" is so bad that it is awesome.  To say the acting is terrible is an understatement, the story is awful and has the continuity problems to prove it; the special effects are brought to you in part by Xbox and/or Kmart Halloween costumes.  In other words, if you want to watch an ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" movie, then just watch an ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" movie.  Nevertheless I feel that ""Alien 3000"" was much more entertaining that ""Alien vs. Predator"".

The plot is simple a woman named Kate (Megan Malloy) is in a mental institution after witnessing everyone from her camping group killed by an ""unknown"" being.  I must say that Megan Malloy is really attractive, sadly her looks don't bleed over into her performance. The mental institution looks like it was filmed in an extra room at an elementary school.  I digress, the military need Kate to track down this ""unknown"" being.  This leads to a motley crew of Special Forces to track down the ""unknown"" being A.K.A ""Alien"".  One of the Special Forces team members is this Goth-type girl with a potty mouth who looks a lot like a girl I use to date. As for the other team members, well if the United States had to recruit this group to pour a glass of milk we are all doomed.

The vast majority of this movie takes place in the woods and/or mountains, so already the production budget of this movie is being saved.  The ""Alien"" is really fake looking, man it is so bad.  Also the ""Alien"" has loot and/or gold if you take it then you have already signed your death certificate. This gold-death conduit is never really explained.

Anyway, there is plenty of blood, guts, screaming, bad acting, dummies, more dummies, exploding body parts, toy helicopters, dummies, fake bats, CGI that mirrors Xbox and oh yeah dummies.  I was laughing so hard during this movie I couldn't stand it. I found myself rewinding stuff just to crack myself up. This movie was non-stop cheese that was either Gorgonzola or Havarti, I still can't decide.

This movie also features Lorenzo Lamas, who seems sedated in his 12 minute part as a solider, Priscilla Barnes (the third blonde from ""Three's Company"") plays a doctor and Scott Schwartz (the kid from ""The Toy"" and my personal favorite ""Raiders of the Living Dead"") has a small part.

The only special feature is a gallery of trailers/previews, yet the trailer/preview for ""Alien 3000"" isn't presented.  Then there is a mock interview with the ""Alien"" about his part in this movie.  The ""Alien"" is just a guy wearing a mask, pretty lame.

This movie has received some pretty low ratings in this forum.  I totally understand why, this movie was a shoddy attempt at a sci-fi and/or horror movie.  This movie plays more as a comedy than a horror or sci-fi movie.  So don't let the cover of the movie seduce you, it isn't a great movie.  However, I lowered my expectations (way down) when I watched this movie and I loved it.  In conclusion, if you walk into an Outback Steakhouse and get a steak you aren't going to be surprised.  I knew what I was going to get from ""Alien 3000"" and that is why I enjoyed it.",1224460800,,3711,4.563444108761329
8062746,1,B0009KQP6Y,"This was the most pathetic excuse for a movie ever made. My god. I wasted $20 on this crap.

It's about some invisible creature who can only be seen if someone shoots paintball at it. It eats gold, lives in a cave and looks like a scarecrow.

The worst part of this movie is that it REALLY takes itself seriously. They HONESTLY think that this movie has a point. Just look at the scene where they shoot the bat? They put some ridicilous MIDI music (MIDI!! they use MIDI files throughout the WHOLE movie) which is supposed to make us feel worried for the characters. Honestly.. I think anyone who starts watching the movie will hope that EVERYONE dies (and they do).

The inteview with ""THE MOSTER"" is nothing more but some pathetic idiot wearing a mask talking about his childhood.

8062747,1,B0009KQP6Y,"Lorenzo Lamas must have took part in this movie after losing a bet! The best part is the peeping Tom scene at the begining, trust me, shut off the movie about 5 minutes into it. It has; No brain College students, a gratuitous make out scene (cut short), a monster which never seems to look the same from one scene to another, merc's who act like they are doing this 'cuz they just lost their jobs as ""Walmart greeters"", a helicoptor that in long shots is an R.C. model and the inside has crap stuck on the walls to make it LOOK like its a helicoptor (like a ""High Voltage"" sign somebody swiped from a warehouse).
