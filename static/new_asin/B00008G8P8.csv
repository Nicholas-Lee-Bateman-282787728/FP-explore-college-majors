1843911,5,B00008G8P8,Oh my! I am completely stunned by this new series. The artwork is beautiful and the characters are the best! This is a series that is a great addition to anyone's collection.,1055376000,2,174,4.46875
1843912,5,B00008G8P8,"I've only been watching anime for a little over 6 months now, but I've managed to see a LOT of it, and Saiyuki has to be one of my favorites.  The interaction between the characters, the bishounen, the interesting stories... the bishounen...(oh wait, I already said that.) Seriously, though. Saiyuki has a truly individual feel to it - part Western, part fantasy, part comedy buddy movie.  I, personally, love the crazy little anacrhonisms like the dragon that turns into a jeep and Sanzo's credit card of the gods.
Another thing I enjoy about this series is that it tends to be very episodic.  While there are overarching plot arcs, (Hakkai's past, how the group got together, etc) once you've met the main characters, you can skip around in the series and not get too lost.
As for packaging and how the DVD was presented, I'm fairly happy with my pretty colector's box.  The X-large t-shirt it came with is way too big for me, but it's very nice.  The menus on the DVD are a little difficult to navigate sometimes, too.
I would have to agree with another reviewer about the English dub.  I'm usually one of those purists who won't watch in anything but subtitles, but the curiosity got the better of me the other night and I watched the last episode in English instead of Japanese.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The voices were pretty on, except I think that Hakkai sounded a little young and Yaone (I can never remember how to spell her name) sounded a little old.  Also, there is quite a bit more swearing in the English version for some reason.  I just can't seem to get my mind around Hakkai saying... some of the things he says in the dub... it's just not right. Other than that, it's very watchable. The Japanese is still my preferred language, though.",1055289600,2,1760,4.576433121019108
1843913,5,B00008G8P8,"I have had a copy of this anime for the longest time and didn't get around to watching it until recently, and it is one of the BEST animes I have EVER seen in a LONG time! The characters are fun and interesting, they make you want to keep watching, just to see what will happen to them, and to learn more about them. There is a nice balance of comedy and drama, and there is an interesting plot along with many other fascinating subplots.
It's based on a Chinese myth, but don't think you need to know chinese folklore just to understand it. It's great and I recommend it to ANY anime fan!",1053734400,3,589,4.175438596491228
1843914,3,B00008G8P8,"Yes, three hot biseinen and one ever-hungry bakazaru (stupid monkey)!  The official review above mentions how 'loosely' this is based on the classic ""Journey to the West"" but frankly Saiyuki is far closer to the classic legend than the much-touted Dragonball. Which *still* isn't saying much, unfortunately... ...  If you want the original legend, Amazon sells some very nice translations, but if you want broody fun, handsome main characters and plenty of off-beat adventure, give Saiyuki a try.
There are dozens of anime series out there that feature girl-heavy casts all panting after one or two main male characters - the stuff of most 15-17 year old boys fantasies, it seems - and a powerful marketing force, at least in most producer's eyes.  But half the world's population is female after all... this is an action-adventure series that still appeals to the boys for it's frequent use of rather slapstick humor as well as violence, but it's slanted to the girls too with a whole pack of angst-ridden characters just trying to survive in a strange and ever-changing fantasy world.  That's another point to mention; this is an odd amalgam of fantasy/modern times.  Just go with it!  There are guns and jeeps and cigarettes but also horse-and-wagon transport, rural life, magic and apparently fuedal political structures.  There is no real attempt made to explain the rational behind the world's setting, but then a great deal of anime asks you to accept even wilder premises, so Saiyuki doesn't break the mold that much.  Except for the fact that the some of the 'villians' are more sympathetic at times than our heroes!
You'll hear the term 'bishounen' tossed around a bit on anime reviews, but that just means 'pretty boy' and is more commonly used because so many anime series tend to be about high school aged protaganists - however, 'biseinen', as I used it above, means 'pretty men' and that's a huge distinction.  Because the Saiyuki men certainly ain't boys... except for Son Gokuu.  Expect a bit more 'adult' humor and situations because of that.

I bought the NewType USA with the preview CD with the initial episode for this release on it.  And the dub, frankly, stinks.  The voices aren't distinct enough to make the characters unique and the 'Americanizing' done to the script drastically alters at least one of the main character's personality.  Nope, sorry, Hakkai is NOT a foul-mouthed surfer-boy as he seems in the preview.  He's supposed to be a soft-spoken, polite and rather reserved man.  I shudder to think of what else ADV has changed about the dub story as well, given just the inital preview.  So I suggest you watch the subtitled version instead to get the real Saiyuki experience.  And no, this isn't a profound anime experience like ""Spirited Away"", but then, it's not touted as such.  This is character-focused action-adventure that occasionally asks some interesting questions about loyalty, friendship and determination.  But it's not deep and it leaves a great deal of it up to the viewer - or at least it did in the original.
I only gave this DVD 3 stars for ADV's version of Saiyuki based on the horrible dub preview disk.  But if the subtitled version available on this DVD sticks to the actual story (and rumor has it that it does *whew*) then it's still worth the price.  Frankly, I'm an otaku-anime-geek who only ever watches subtitled versions anyway but I understand the economic necessity of dubs for the general viewing audience - I just wish the material was treated with more respect by the importing companies.  And while this means anime is coming over to the US faster and faster all the time, it's disturbing that companies like ADV feel it's their right to change the original stories so much.  Leave it be.  The cultural differences aren't *that* hard to explain - and the changes in the dub that I saw weren't improvements at all, in my humble opinion.  They were just annoying.
But join Genjo Sanzo, Cho Hakkai, Sha Gojyo, Hakuryuu and Son Gokuu on their journey West!  It's a heck of a ride...",1050105600,17,4051,4.850290697674419
1843953,5,B00008G8P8,"Like most anime, it has its good episodes and weak ones. I saw this whole series first and really enjoyed it, then went looking for the manga it is based on. Others reviews and write ups will give you the whole historical journey to the west legend, so I'll just say that the anime is nicely faithful to the manga, both in artwork and plot. In some cases it's almost scene for scene. The real ""easter eggs"" of the manga are what the anime sugar-coated or left out. I'm only up to vol. 5 of the manga so far, but here are some of the highlights:

***Spoiler space if you don't want to know****

Kanan was Gonou/Hakkai's blood relative older sister, but they were raised in different orphanages. They kept this a secret when they became lovers. The town where they settled gave Kannan over to the demon king, since she was just a stranger and and orphan, as a sacrifice to protect their own daughters. Gonou started off his massacre with the human townspeople, then moved on to the demons.

Hakkai wears a monocle to hide the fact that he tore out his own right eye when confronted by one of the demon survivors right before he tried to go bury Kanan's remains. (I haven't finished the manga, so I don't know if he somehow gets a new one or not, but he tore it right out by the roots and was going for the other one when Goku stops him.  Under that calm mask, he really is a crazy baka.

In one episode a youkai punk  taunts Gojyo about his hair color, asking if the ""hair down there"" matches his famous red mane. ie, if the ""carpet matchs the drapes."" In both the anime and manga Gojyo coyly says only the prettiest ladies get to find out , but in the manga Goku lets slip that he's seen the truth in the baths.

*

*extra spoiler space*

The carpet does NOT match the drapes (it's black according to Goku), although Gojyo's red hair is natural anyway.",1112918400,2,1851,4.295977011494253
1843954,1,B00008G8P8,"the manga of this is a lot better. they twisted lots of stuff in this, and the character voices really don't fit their age and even the characters' personalities are messed up. don't waste your money on this. buy the manga.",1098748800,2,223,4.463414634146342
1843955,4,B00008G8P8,"First, this series is intriguing. I like it. Honestly, I rented this DVD on Saturday, and liked it so much that I sunk $100 into buying the first four volumes. Still, this series has flaws.
First, for the uninitiated, ""Saiyuki"" is the Japanese name for the ancient Chinese classic ""Journey to the West"". The very famous fable of the the Monkey King (Wukong in Chinese, Goku in Japanese) is presented in the book, and the anime series is a (very loose!) retelling of this amazing tale. All in all, the series is fresh and interesting. Here, the priest Sanzo is commanded to undergo a journey to the land of India to fetch stolen scriptures from a demon and a trio of mad doctors attempting to resurrect a horrible monster. He is accompanied by three unique beings, each demon himself, who possess both mighty powers and mysterious pasts. The story takes a bit to find its footing, but the relationship of the four ""friends"" keeps it afloat early. In later DVD's, the character's pasts are presented, and the story becomes MUCH better.
The animation of the series may not appeal to all, but I find it novel and exciting. There are many still shots, but the camera work is excellent. However, some parts are annoying (including the cheesy deaths of the demons, and the CRAPPY drawings of the spiders and crabs - maybe the animator should stay away from eight-legged monsters?). As I mentioned above, the story takes time to lift off, and the writing (or maybe translation) is very uneven. Sometimes, the wit will leave you in stitches, but many times you will groan at the lines.
By far the worst aspect of the series is the English voiceover. It's a shame - for once, the dialogue isn't stilted, but wow, are the voices bad. Some are lovably awful (Gojyu sounds like our old friend Butthead!), but others are just terrible (the lead doctor's voice screams hunchback Igor, not genius Dr. Frankenstein). This is the reason for the deduction of a star.
Still, I would recommend this to anyone, particularly those who know the tale of the Monkey King. It is fun to watch!",1076889600,5,2065,4.675824175824176
1843956,5,B00008G8P8,"The Journey to the West has been done in hundreds of differant ways with this being one of the latest versions.  Is's nice to see Sanzo being this sexy dude with an attitude, instead of a wimp who breaks down into tears when things go wrong.  Actually I like the English dubbing, the voices are just fine to me and by watching both the english and japanese versions of the story, gives one a better appriciation for the differances in culture and how the story is perseved.",1069632000,7,473,4.425287356321839
1843957,4,B00008G8P8,"I first watched the japanese with the english subtitles. In english they seem to change the characters personality's which I did not like. Hakkai is suppose to be a nice and gental person that fights with a smile and stay's some what culm. But in the english he is a smart month with a smile. I did not like that at all. People write reviews on the cartoon it self. People need to write about the DVD's as well as the plot and amagination of the cartoon. They changed Sanzo to but, he sometimes has his attitude which in the japanese voice he always has a attitude. Goujo is still the same and Goku some what. I can say that the english voices was not very well done. Japanese is better it shows the real emotions of all what they are going throw. Even the evil demon prince and his female Yaone changed their personalitys too. What was they thinking seriously. They seem to do this to alot of great anime. The dvd it self has plus points. like a poster with each DVD. The art work with some funny notes and it only has the theme and ending theme song on the dvd without credits. The show you the japanese and english voice acters. Well I guess that's it but I really wasn't please with the english. I really wish the company's in USA would stop trying to improve it in their way cause they just make it worst. This DVD has english and japanese with english subtitles and english with japanese subtitles. The series itself I give a 5 but how america messed it up a 3. So I'll give it a 4.
And the english version has way to many cuse words. What is up with that? UNKNOWN TO ME. Well great series and this DVD has 5 episodes.",1064880000,3,1624,4.208333333333333
1843958,4,B00008G8P8,"There is no lack of anime series that feature a group of people going an epic journey to fight evil.  Whether they involve card decks or swords the offer enjoyable, but fairly predictable fare.  So my first reaction when reading the announcements for Saiyuki was to put it on my 'someday' list.  Well, 'someday' has arrived, and with it the surprising discovery that Saiyuki is much more than another adventure story.
It starts out unassumingly enough.  In an alternate world of Chinese mythology, demons and humans have coexisted peacefully until recently.  Now, many have dropped all restraint and are actively at war with humans.  Sanzo Genjo, a priest, has been assigned by his gods to seek out the source of this crisis and bring it to an end.  Accompanying him are three 'peaceable' demons.  Son Goku, a monkey king, Sha Gojyo, a semi-human water sprite, and Cho Hakkai, a full blooded demon with a pet dragon who does double duty as a jeep.
Behaving more like a rock band on tour than a group of do-gooders, this team sets out through Asia headed for the source of the mystery in India.  They fight, drink, wench, and eat their way across the countryside.  For the most part, the plot itself is straightforward, bash demons, save young maidens, and indulge in other heroics with a good jolt of comedy.
There is a serious side to their antics, and, layer-by-layer, we discover parts of the true stories behind each of out heroes.  We also get to meet the villains, and discover that there is more to them than meets the eye.  There are no classic 'pretty boys' in this series.  Certainly, Saiyuki is a much more complex story than its surface would imply.
What makes the tales unique is the dialog and byplay between the companions.  They play as a group of guys who share a bond, not as archetypical bold heroes.  And they are very much adults (all in their 20's or 500's).  Anime (or films) that depict this kind of male interrelationship are almost non-existent, but the writers have done a successful job of creating characters and dialog which is entertaining (if a bit blunt), but lacks any 'cute' overtones.
The result is an interesting story, much fresher than the norm for it's genre.  It has a somewhat rough artistic style, but the animation is solid.  The dubbing is a bit milder than the subtitles but is close in spirit.  I feel that from the onset, Saiyuki is worth viewing.",1060300800,7,2395,4.673031026252984
1843959,5,B00008G8P8,"Saiyuki (The book of Western venture - Chinese title) is one of the most well known ancient Chinese fantasy novels.  There have been tons of presentation of the story and/or the characters including the inspired Anime show Dragonball Z.  This is a very creative version of the story (a small but important section of the novel).  The modern clothes and dialog, the smoking and gambling monk carrying a revolver and the sexy goddess (actually the character is a scary looking male showing himself in female form according to Buddhist legend) are all controversial in the religious and traditional world when the manga released a few years ago.  Watch beyond the modern presentation you will see a very in-depth story combining personal soul search, friendship and belief.
I watched the entire series in Japanese and I am waiting for all the English DVDs out before purchasing the set.  So I can't comment on how good is the English translation.
The animation is superb and characters have clear and likeable personalities.  I highly recommend this show to all Anime fans.",1059264000,,1070,4.98314606741573
1843960,4,B00008G8P8,"Ok, I bought this DVD without knowing what was it was a bout, but my friend told me that there's a very good anime called Saiyuki, so that's more or less why I got it.
 The characters are very unique and they will practically always send you laughing, the constant fighting between Gojyo (a pervy water demon whose afraid of water) and Goku (An ever-hungry monkey god) are the main high points.
Now I know people's feelings about dubs, but trust me on this one, this dub aint half bad. I started watching it in English first (No I don't like to read for EVERY frame, so sue me) and they did a very good job, one low point is that Hakkai (A VERY polite and quiet member) swears and in Japanse he doesnt, that annoyed me, but to be honest the English version made me laugh more than the Japanse version.
 But I say that any anime fan HAS to have a look at this series!",1058918400,,866,4.179640718562874
1843961,5,B00008G8P8,"The reviewer has a point about the numerous camera pans, but the art is great so it doesn't really detract from the show.  I didn't even notice it till after reading the review and going back to look for it.
The anacronisms like Sanzo's pistol, a dragon that turns into a jeep, and some characters showing up in jeans give the show a unique atmosphere.  The humor is riske but a lot of fun.
The main characters are quite likable (even, well especially the villians), despite Sanzo's best efforts to be otherwise.  The hints of background given in the first volume are what truly hooked me on the series.",1057708800,,603,4.513761467889908

It's the perfect price for just trying the anime out and it shipped pretty quickly. All around thumbs up. If you don't like watching it in Japanese with the subtitles and settle for the English I do warn that the voices my seem a little odd compared the the Japanese settings but it's still worth it and a good show.

Ok,

Well the storyline of Saiyuki has been, and always will be great! But the anime......blah.....

Lets just say, without the amazingly fantastic storyline, this anime would be a total flop;

The fighting scenes are seriously corny, alot of the english vocals are corny/non-fitting, and the animation/art in some parts are, well, not as good as i expected.

So would i recommend spending $27.00? No way in hell. But i do recommend watching it, if you liked the Manga. Just go to eBay, or rent it from blockbuster or something.......

(Much cheaper that way....)

You shouldn't pay $27.00 for it,

it or any other anime DVD personally.......I beleive Overstock.com has it for cheaper too......

(I rented it....)

Well i hope that helped.....

7982917,5,B00008G8P8,"Many nay-sayers basically call Saiyuki ""an overblown Xiyouji fanfic"" & others say ""the manga was better. But this isn't about Xiyouji OR the manga, this is about the anime.

Okey, here's my personal big-shocker; this is one of those 2 in 300 anime's you'll see where the dubb is BETTER. Why is the dubb better? Because the Japanese voices of all but Hakkai are annoying & ill-fitting (wich kills the humor of Goku & Gojyo fighting)& the dubb adds hillarious swearing & gay jokes (well, Minekura does specialize in BL manga, so it seems fitting).

The fact that each episode is a little different from the manga chapter it's based on it GOOD because you won't know what to execpt all the time & get bored. Sometimes the episodes seem loosely based on a manga's chapter & some just come out of nowhere.

It's really funny when you get into their psyche & see the bond from Goku's POV. Gojyo is like his big brother, Hakkai is like the father, & the others tease Sanzo about being motherly with kids. (I wouldn't want him as MY mother)

The music is excelent. The few annoying aspects of the anime are that Gojyo is refurred to as having purple hair (it's red no matter how much you look at it)& that the boys are pretty unnatractive (especially Hakkai, but Gojyo's not bad at all).",1135468800,2,1279,4.5

7982919,1,B00008G8P8,"Unfortunately this series has been misnamed.  It should not have been called Saiyuki.  Instead it should have been called ""At least one pointless, boring fight before every commercial break.""  I guess that would have been too long, though.

Saiyuki starts telling the story before the background has even been properly fleshed out.  No matter... even though there's some typical Big Threat out there to be dealt with the characters are cardboard cutouts, so you probably won't care where they are going, or why.

But hey... at least one of the protagonists has a cute little pet dragon!

That can transform.

Into a WWII-era Jeep.

When was this story supposed to be taking place again?  Wasn't it supposed to be based off a myth?  Oh who cares... it sucks.

And for the love of god... if I have to sit through one more anime that makes use of those stupid, stupid pantomines that the Japanese seem to love so dearly... I'll have to kill someone.

Poor animation, amateur use of special effects, an uninteresting plot, horrible dialogue, and no characterization all doom Saiyuki from the start.  Maybe it got better after the first couple episodes, but frankly, I couldn't be bothered.

If you don't mind having your intelligence insulted then you'll probably enjoy this anime.  Everyone else should avoid it at all costs.",1129680000,2,1322,4.887387387387387
