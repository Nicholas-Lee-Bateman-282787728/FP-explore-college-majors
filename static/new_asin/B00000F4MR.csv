When you pop the tape into the VCR it starts right away telling you that this is a children's movie (which it is not, even though I did watch it as a little kid all the time from a copy taped off a midnight movie TV show)- there's even a little boy who tells you how to adjust the tracking, and warns you that there will be previews at the end of the tape.

I believe because this is ""supposed"" to be a children's movie, that they edited the two following scenes.

-The raft murder sequence where a woman is partially devoured and then bleeds to death in the water. The entire middle of this scene has been chopped- leaving just the appearance of the monster, and her bleeding to death in the water.

-A part of the monster fight at the end where the Pterodactyl pokes the Pleisiosaur's eye out.

I'm not a gore fan or anything, but I was just sad that this wasn't the entire movie I remembered. But it is still so good.",1096588800,3,994,4.2105263157894735
8180515,5,B00000F4MR,"You never would have thought a movie could be this bad....It is very unfortunate that it is so difficult to get a copy of this bizarre gem. Really folks, the movie screams bad taste but, god is it entertaining. Strangely though the copy i own says the rating is PG..i really doubt it (says on coverbox and on the video!). Oh yeah.. Some of the monster models are definitly made out of styrofoam.  BUY ME!",1014076800,5,404,4.386666666666667
8180516,4,B00000F4MR,"the most absurd and audacious film to come out of japan. This Jaws-like movie features a mean plesiosaur eating the residents at a lake by Mt. Fuji eventually fighting a pteranodon. Outrageously violent, disturbing in the extreme with effective (albeit dated)music sets the tone for sleazy viewing pleasure. The direction by Junji Kawata is pretty much ""art house"" and shocking. Viewers beware: This movie is not for everyone.",998438400,2,426,5.279411764705882
