2088515,4,B0002F6AJI,"What a shame that Amazon.com reviewer Bret Fetzer chose to look at the film in a political context rather than review it for the performances and technical achievement.

 I first saw this film on Showtime and was pleasantly surprised by the performances, particularly those of Penny Johnson Jerald (of FOX's ""24"") as Condoleeza Rice, and Mary Gordon Murray as Laura Bush.

 The intersplicing of real 9/11 footage with the filmmakers' shots is well done. And, while the end of the film could be seen as a campaign poster, the editing of the footage returns us to the reality that 3000 people lost their lives on September 11, 2001... which really is the point after all, isn't it?",1091491200,26,679,4.777777777777778
2088526,5,B0002F6AJI,We recently visited Ground Zero and my daughter had so many questions.  I felt this documentary explained the days events in a way that a 12 year old could begin to understand the horror we all went through on that day.,1358726400,,219,4.341463414634147
2088527,2,B0002F6AJI,"I like documentaries and docudramas depicting historical events like Thirteen Days; The Reagans; The Kennedys and United 93. They are films done effectively to portray what we felt as a nation during those times. Mixing actual footage with actors is done impressively on a positive note here. The actors did a convincing job that there was some human emotion exchanged between Bush, Cheney, Rumsfield, Powell, Rice and company, particularly the hug between Cheney (Lawrence Pressman) and Bush, or the scene of Condoleeza Rice (Penny Johnson Jerald) weeping over her television, although America never saw these leaders as the film shows. The only portrayal and script of any of the actors in the film that America did see both on the nightly news and this film comes from Donald Rumsfield, as actor John Cunningham does successfully. Also, the films ending was unique in that it edits actual footage of Bush's speech to congress with clips of actor Timothy Bottoms and there the film concludes with the hopes and intent to seek ""justice"".

However, on the negative side, if Timothy Bottoms were elected president over George W Bush, 911 would never have happened. This film represents President Bush as a leader that would have stopped, or the least took heed to the documented warnings we all know now Bush and our expensive defensive industry ignored whether intentionally or accidentally. After the attack, Bush relents on concentrating on Iraq rather than the capture and punishment of the real ""evil doers"". This film portrays Bush as a devout Christian, passionate, articulate and take charge intellectual leader and Cheney as a ""stand down for the president"" type of VP, which is far from the truth. The scene where Bush gets choked up in front of the media cameras and the public on his thoughts and prayers for the victims has never surfaced if it exists or at least not to the emotional extent the film shows. This is not propaganda unless the machine of conservatism works to convince Americans that the events in this film are real and an honest depiction of George W. Bush, the man. It appears to be a wishful dramatization for hardcore conservatives and fans in denial on the fact that invading Iraq, killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and capturing Saddam Hussein somehow brings justice to fighting a ""new kind of war"", yet still, Bin Laden did manage to successfully flee ""justice"" and those famous words of ""whoever did this will pay"" nor did the nations of Germany, Pakistan, Egypt or Afghanistan ever answer for their harboring or ignoring this terrorist cell as Bush promised. Instead, we invaded the enemy of our enemy.

If this were my film, I would have simply made a documentary of interviews, real footage and a timeline of what President Bush the American citizen and leader of the most powerful nation in the world rallying our response to the horrors of that September morning. Instead, we get over two hours of a desperate attempt to humanize the man as a romantic soldier complete with direction and confidence barking orders to the secret service, his Vice President, his wife and consoling the nations broken heart like a Sunday pastor and fatherlike executive. All this, taken from what writer Lionel Chetwynd managed to absorb firsthand from Bush himself, so we can pretty much conclude that this film, and the angles, opinions and emotional takes, came from the brain of George W. Bush himself.",1344556800,,3443,4.965337954939342
2088528,5,B0002F6AJI,"If you want to learn about Flight Suit Boy's behavior on 9/11, this isn't it.  Here, Bush is a True American Hero, rather than the sniveling little coward who hid away in Kansas.  This is pure propaganda from the worst president in our history -- somebody who wasn't even elected!  There is, of course, no mention of the fact that he was specifically warned about Osama bin Laden only a month before the attacks but was too busy clearing brush to do anything about it.

Timothy Bottoms does a good job as this Bush That Is Not Bush.  It's like tuning into a parallel universe.  The time was a tragedy, but Bush was farce.  Intelligent viewers will be able to sort out the lies.",1256256000,,677,4.411290322580645

If you like a suspenseful drama well-made and of high quality,  this is it.  I would recommend it to all my friends as a keep-sake of that very important event in our lifetime.

2088533,4,B0002F6AJI,"Some might say it puts a positive spin on the Bush administration's activities on 9/11 and the following days but I would challenge anyone to find anything portrayed which was not factual.  Consider it a dramatization of historical events which changed our lives forever.  You can be sure it will be shared with my children and grandchildren.  There should be more of this genre produced based upon factual events.  It is a shame the likes of Michael Moore get so much more publicity for pseudo-documentaries based on half-truth and out-right lies while this film, which factually portrays our leaders in a positive light, is pushed aside as propaganda due to political bias.  ""A Bright and Shining Lie"", ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""DC 9/11 A Time of Crisis"" should all be presented in high school history classes.  They display America at its best when the rest of the world is running the other direction.  This movie is a rare opportunity to see what happens behind closed doors as historic decisions are made.  It also gives the viewer great insight into the intricacies, variables, cause and affect of the decisions made by the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government during a true crisis.",1161993600,4,1190,4.885572139303482
2088534,2,B0002F6AJI,"This movie is funny. I'm not even considering my political view in this.

The actors look nothing like the people they try so desperately to portray. The actor does a better job on Comedy Central then here. But it's so comedic that I'm shocked they didn't sponser this. With the exception of the Con. Rice, the people don't act nothing like the real-life counterparts. When it's not funny, it's depressingly bad.

I cannot give it one star, as I laughed too much. But I feel three is too much. So two stars it is.",1160438400,2,513,4.446808510638298
2088535,1,B0002F6AJI,"Hmmmmm.  No ""0 star"" rating, so ""1 star"" will have to do.

The summary says ""Based on real life accounts,"" but this is so far removed from any ""real life"" events that it should have a content advisory label to warn viewers against excessive levels of historical distortion.  Apparently there is only some small fraction of 1% of ""docu"" needed to sell a partison acid trip like this and call it a ""docudrama.""

I don't remember actually throwing away a DVD before, but ""DC 9/11 Time of Crisis"" was so bad that I actually destroyed the disc before putting it the trash  ---I just had to be sure that there'd be no risk of it ever spinning up again.

If you want to see content that truly is ""Based on real life accounts,"" treat yourself to Greenwald's ""Uncovered - The War on Iraq.""  There's almost no commentary, just a steady flow of interviews, news footage, etc., and, without the benefit of screenplay propaganda, the Bush administration presents the ""real life accounts"" that show the true colors behind their leadership and management....",1159660800,5,1043,4.7292817679558015
2088546,1,B0002F6AJI,"This is a movie about 9/11 made with only one purpose, and that is to tell us what the Bush administration wants us to believe happened immediately after the WTC attack.

The plot is something like this: WTC attacked, world is shocked. The Great President is shocked. The Great President talks to advisors. The Great President realizes the attack was made because the terrorists envy the wonderful American democracy and the wonderful American freedom.

Timothy Bottoms makes a decent job playing The Great President, but he certainly doesn't play George W. Bush. He doesn't talk like him and he doesn't act like him. This is even more obvious in one of the last scenes, where they cut from Bottoms playing Bush to actual footage of Bush. It's laughable. I don't think I've ever seen any portrayal of a contemporary real-life person that is so obviously re-written and polished in order to make the person look like the hero he really isn't.

This movie made me think of those old WW2 propaganda short films where the narrator tells the audience what they're supposed to think, ""Why We Fight"", etc. It's so ludicrous and yet so frightening that this kind of movie can be taken seriously.

This is an awful piece of propaganda and it's offensive to all the victims of the 9/11 attacks and to everyone who lost somebody that day.",1156118400,7,1327,4.756521739130434
2088547,5,B0002F6AJI,"I am amazed at the venomous tone of some negative reviews posted for this film.  As I read them through, I am struck by the language used -- the writers ""don't think"" this is what really happened, or say ""this isn't how the real President Bush really is.""  They say the president ""hid in a secret bunker until it was all clear.""  They say with stunning certainty that it's a ""crock"" that the president reads his Bible before going to bed.  They brand the film ""pure propaganda.""  They use juvenile terms and childish names in attacking this president.

One easily can see the mindset behind such absurdities.  The Michael Moore-minded, who hated this president from the moment he took office, will always create reasons to continue to hate him.  And in their closed minds, anything showing him in a good light cannot possibly be true.

The negative reviews on this Amazon page originate not in any inherent flaws in this film, but in the fires ignited and fanned by the Left these last five years, flames of irrational hatred for this president that have labeled him -- as the Leftist fashion of the moment has dictated -- as stupid, or incompetent, or a brilliant warmonger who deceived all of Congress, or a brainless puppet in Cheney's hands, or a liar, or a criminal, or a fiend who actually took part in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  Such vitriolic, contradictory absurdities as THESE are the lies, and the hindsight of history will prove as much.

This may, in fact, be one of the most accurate television docudramas ever made.  Its screenwriter interviewed dozens of persons inside and outside the White House and found each personal account corroborating the next.  And throughout the story, in many places and wherever possible, verbatim dialogue was used.

The Bush you see in this movie IS the Bush currently sitting in the White House -- a man of faith, a man of morals, a Christian man of honest intent driven by personal conviction, not opinion polls.

This movie, within the framework of television drama, does a very good job of conveying the actual events of those traumatic days in 2001.  It is superbly written, well directed and edited, and brilliantly acted.  While the docudrama format demands some liberties be taken, this film never strays far from reality.

2088548,2,B0002F6AJI,"This movie presents a behind the scenes view of the white house and they are depicted exactly the way every patriotic American would like them to be.  It strikes me as very much in keeping with the tradition of war propaganda films from WWII, but with the focus being on the character and wisdom of our leader rather than appealing to our patriotic tendencies and passion for principles such as freedom and justice (these elements are here, but they are secondary).  Personally, I'd rather rally around the flag on this tragedy based on a behind the scenes look at first responders and other directly impacted American --especially since the current administration still has a stake in events yet to unfold (as a the actor portraying Don Rumsfeld says, this is a war in ""slow motion""). Prudence would seem to demand that America take more time before we digest events and portray them dramatically let alone speculate on behind the scenes events. So all this subject matter at this point in time makes me a little uncomfortable.

That said, if you need to see your leader in the best possible light, this is the film for you. If you use rely on film to flesh out your understanding of reality, viewing this flattering movie should be balanced by viewing a critical perspective such as Fahrenheit 9/11. Yes, both have an agenda, no doubt about it. Some will find the agenda of this film distasteful especially if they find the current administration somewhat disingenuous prior to its participated in this production. Others will not feel that such collaboration undermines the filmmakers objectivity in any way. You will need to ponder on this and decide for your self.  Wherever you stand, while the casting of the look-a-likes is interesting and reinforces a sense of authenticity at a dramatic level, the acting will be seen as completely substandard by all discerning viewers. The content and context makes this portrayal powerful, not the acting, writing, or directing.",1127001600,6,1974,4.936746987951807
2088549,1,B0002F6AJI,"The person that said that scares me. ""This is how it was""? Were you there? Because the people who made this film weren't. It's largely stuff said in meetings that nobody could possibly know about. And worst part is there is a scene faked where the media is involved. The scene where Bush is crying on the telephone. The media is there filming it. That never happened!

And this Bush is just ridiculous! I WISH Timothy Bottoms was the president! He's a heck of a lot better than the real Bush! The Bush in this movie has plans. He has ideas. He has morals. He has a brain. He has a spine! All things the actual president is lacking.

2088550,5,B0002F6AJI,"I first saw this gripping film with my church prayer group, afterward we bowed our heads and thanked The Almighty for blessing this great nation with such a strong, moral Man of God as President of the United States of America! This movie shows how God can take a semi-retarded, coke-snorting, failed businessman and reform him into a brave, noble, and decisive leader-the best our nation has ever seen!

I know godless liberals would have you believe that this film is nothing short of ridiculous, horribly-done, over-the-top propaganda, provided solely for ignorant, kin-pumping rednecks, but that's just because they hate freedom and liberty and are disengaged with reality. Every night I pray that these Michael Moore-loving pagans will get their lives right and see the light. Jesus is the light, and W is His Messenger!

I think this film, which truthfully depicts our President's finest hour, should be required viewing for all Americans, especially those (the ethically-challenged liberal elite media) who attempt to slander our righteous leader! In my opinion, this film is as accurate as Gospel. Believe me I know, I'm a political science major at Bob Jones University. My fellow church-going conservatives and I were so compelled by this docu-drama that we almost enlisted in the service to help fight the cause, but unfortunately it's not God's Will, I'll be needing all my limbs to serve our nation, so instead we bought yellow ribbons for our SUV's because it's our patriotic duty to ""support our troops"" as they fight for this God-fearing nation.

I also remember Mr. Bush hiding out in a secret bunker for a couple days until it was all clear.  This is heroic???!  Rudi Guiliani was MUCH more of a hero during this crisis than the president.  Where is his docu-drama?!  At least Mr. Guiliani stayed in NYC and tried to maintain order and keep the people calm.  Why is it that we, in America, do not quite understand the definition of a hero.

Most of the reviewers seemed oblivious to, if not grateful for, the lies.

2088571,5,B0002F6AJI,"I just finished watching the film DC 9/11, and I was very impressed with it.  Granted, it is a film that is made to present President Bush and his administration in the best light possible.  This film definitely presents Bush as heroic in his handling of the 9/11 crisis.  But, in a way, how else could Bush be portrayed?  Put aside for a moment America's division over Bush's actions later in his administration (Iraq, etc.).  Think back to Bush's performance as President in the week of the 9/11 attack, which is the subject of this film.  I think any reasonable individual would say that Bush handled the situation extremely well, and was able to rally the nation to a firm resolve to recover from the tragedy.

Plus, when one thinks about it, a film that centers on an important leader can either present the person as very heroic or very villainous.  There are few films that find the ability to present a person's flaws and virtures (Patton would be one of the few).  Look at films like Thirteen Days (which portrays Kennedy as being near godlike in his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis) or Nixon (which presents that President as pratically the devil incarnate).

There are several reasons why I think that every American should see this film:

1) Despite the film's pro-Bush slant, the film is actually very accurate in its potrayal of what happened in the White House during 9/11 and in the week following the attack.  The best source available on this subject is Bob Woodward's book, Bush at War.  The book details the players, actions, and decisions of the Bush administration from the day of the attacks to the military operations in Afghanistan.  Woodward had full access to White House documents and personnel to write his book.  As anyone who is familiar with Woodward's work knows, he is not anyone political patsy.  In fact, he later wrote a book, Plan of Attack, which has been touted by both Bush supporters and anti-Bush people as THE book to read on the administration's decisions leading up to the invasion of Iraq.  The reason why I bring up Woodward's book, Bush at War, is because this film's potrayal of events line up extremely well with the facts laid out in Woodward's book, and with other documented accounts of the events.  Therefore, despite its biases, the film is a great, factual look at how the President and his administration handled the crisis, which is a vital story for Americans to know about our recent history.

2) The film also give clear indications about how the Bush administration came to the course it took in handling the war on terror.  The military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Patriot Act, and other elements, are clearly forshadowed in the scenes involving meetings between the President and the National Security Council.  As President Bush himself told his people in one of these meetings, ""we are fighting an unconventional war against a very different kind of enemy.  We have to start thinking in unconventional ways.""  The film also shows through these scenes the disputes within the administration over how broad the war should be prosecuted (Powell and Rumsfeld and their  disagreements over Iraq, for example), and the weaknesses in America's intelligence community before 9/11.  For example, in one scene, President Bush asks the directors of the CIA and FBI why they were not communicating with each other about the suspected terrorists effectively, one of them replied, ""well, sir, our computers don't network with each other.""  Bush looked like he was about explode with frustration.

3) Timothy Bottoms did a fantastic job in potraying President Bush.  He lacks Bush's pronounced Texas accent, but that was probably a decision on his part and that of the filmmakers to avoid any chance of his performance coming off as some comical impersonation.  Instead, Bottoms performs the role of President Bush with a focus on copying his demeanor (hand jestures, posture, facial expressions) mixed in with a focus on the President's emotions and mind set.  You get to see the personal side of Bush in those days, since the filmmakers interviewed Bush and those close to him to get a sense of his thoughts and feelings at that time.  It really shows Bush as someone who developed a resolve to do everything he could to prevent another 9/11.  One can argue about how he went about fighting the war on terror later, but few can doubt that his actions come from an internal impulse to never see another day like 9/11.  A masterful performance that should have earned Bottoms an Emmy, and would have if it were not for the political bias of those in Hollywood.

This film masterfully captures an important moment in history through the point of view of the leadership in America the time it happened.",1096761600,39,4769,4.839704069050555
2088572,4,B0002F6AJI,"It is only fair to aknowledge that DC 9/11 is essentially the way President Bush and the members of his administration tell their story. That said, it is all consistent with the known facts, and even republicans are entitled to express their point of view - particularly about their own actions.

  If - make that when - a flattering behind-the-scenes drama is made about the Clinton White House, Clintonites will - rightly - expect it to be taken at face value; at least as long as there is  nothing in it that is proven false. Those who disbelieve this portrayal of Bush and Company are entitled to their opinion. But, it is only opinion.

  This account is plausible. In my opinion it is accurate. The President deserves recognition for the tremendous burden he has taken on. He has done better than most of us would have - and he has not complained. Laura Bush, Condaleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Karen Hughes and many others portrayed here deserve credit for rising to this tragic occasion. The War on Terror is a greater challenge than any of them expected when they signed on at the Bush White House.

  It is amazing that Timothy Bottoms could play a serious George W. after playing him as a likable buffoon on ""That's My Bush"". The rest of the cast were also excellent. At times I was reminded of some of the better episodes of ""The West Wing"".

  All in all; one side of the story very well told.",1095552000,26,1402,4.515873015873016

I guess if this is revisionism then the Discovery Channel and PBS are on the revisionist band wagon by showing a National Geographic Documentary on Air Force One, and a President and 9/11 special. This docudrama caught that day, showing the mistakes of the Phoenix memos, and the initial responses.  Politics aside, this film shows The President's true feelings and that he did respond during those infamous 7 minutes.  Let's try and leave politics out of a movie review. (...) Just remember this, if you were President what would you have done?  Back to the DVD- the actors looked and sounded like the people.  Bottoms did great as President Bush and Lawrence Pressman (coach in American Pie and in Winds of War on TV) was uncannily a double for Vice President Dick Cheney.

To see how Al Gore has acted the past 3 yrs & his rants close to the way Howard Dean or Micheal Moore speak make me wonder how he would have handled 9-11...This movie is the first one of its kind to show how our president handled this day & shows that only 99% of the media & left coast loonys in hollywood are anti-bush.",1095033600,18,691,3.971223021582734
2088598,5,B0002F6AJI,"This is a very well-done depiction of the White House and its response to the events of 9/11 and its immediate aftermath.  Amazon claims that it is pro-Bush, but I don't agree.  In fact, the country was united behind the President for a time during and after 9/11, and that is what this film is all about.  Yes, the film depicts Condi Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, etc. as ""selfless civil servants""  (See Amazon editorial review).  Never mind what is so bad about that.

The film does a fine job of bringing out the effort by the White House team to ""think outside the box"" and come up with a creative and unconventional way to destroy Al-Quaida and liberate Afghanistan from the tyranny of the Taliban.  In doing so, a small American force accomplished in 3 months what a huge Soviet army failed to do in 8 years.  What's not to like?  The film brilliantly highlights the planning that went into this.

I know that I was too busy dealing with the effects of 9/11 (stock market crash, effects on my business, other events, etc.) to really keep track at the time of what was going on.  This film does a fine job of putting the events of that terrible time into perspective, and re-acquainting us with the difficulties faced by the White House at the time.  Contrary to some reviews, e.g. Amazon's, the film does bring out some uncertainties and downright errors that the President and his team made at the time, such as Bush's less than stellar first TV broadcast to the nation, and the issue as to when he should return to Washington DC.

Timothy Bottoms is uncannily like George W. Bush.  The rest of the cast is also quite good.

This is splendid entertainment, and excellent historical fiction.  Enjoy.",1094947200,34,1712,4.600660066006601

It's a straight forward telling of the events of 9/11 from the White House perspective.  Anyone watching it will be able to relate since I'm sure all of us know where we were and what we were doing at the exact same time.

But I really wonder about the venomous 1-stars I see on here: do you hate President Bush so much that you can't even recognize what a horrible tragedy was committed against us that day?

That you would completely trash a well-crafted film documenting what happened to this country?

This is ""propaganda""?  Read Bob Woodward's BUSH AT WAR, look at the record.  I'm completely flabbergasted at these charges.

This is no comedy though.

I'm neither a republican nor a democrat and it's ashame that people view this film in a partisan manner, because that's not its purpose.  This film was made by the same network that got so much heat for making the Ronald Reagan movie starring James Brolin.  I might also point out that Showtime is far more liberal in it's programming (re: Queer as Folk, The L Word, etc) than HBO and it came to a shock to many people that they were even remotely involved.

2088604,5,B0002F6AJI,"Fast paced and riveting, this is one of the best Showtime productions I've seen, and certainly the most moving, and is an excellent dramatization of 9/11 from the perspective of the Bush Administration, and chronicles the events that were taken from that fateful day to the president's speech to congress on September 20th.
The actors are marvelous, and convincing in their parts not just because of any physical similarities, but more impressive are the speech patterns and body language that are so like the people they are portraying.

Timothy Bottoms is terrific as President Bush, with his mix of toughness and sentiment, and the subtle variations from the halting, insecure first talk to the nation which is perfectly replicated, to the strong and affecting episode at Ground Zero. Other memorable performances come from John Cunningham as Donald Rumsfeld, Lawrence Pressman: Dick Cheney, Mary Gordon Murray: Laura Bush, Penny Johnson: Condi Rice, Gerry Mendicino: George Tenet, Allan Royal: Karl Rove, Scott Alan Smith: Ari Fleischer, Carolyn Scott: Karen Hughes, Andrew Gillies: Tony Blair, Stephen Macht: Paul Wolfowitz, and Gregory Itzin is stupendous as John Ashcroft.

Written and produced by Lionel Chetwynd, and directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith, this is respectful and accurate, and has actual footage of the events cleverly interspersed with the dramatic interpretation. The scene from the National Cathedral on September 14th, and the final section at the Capitol are particularly well edited.
As a political junkie and C-SPAN addict, I found this to be a faithful and meticulous telling of the horror of 9/11, and our response to the faceless hate that is terrorism, and it is refreshing to see a film that shows respect for the office of the president.
Way above average cable production; total running time is 128 minutes.
