""Beauty and the Beast"" is, without a doubt, THE BEST sci-fi/fantasy/drama ever made for television.  The writing and scripts were outstanding.  Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton made a powerful presence as Vincent and Catherine.  Story lines drew people in on a dime.  You were hooked each week.  It was different.  It was special.  It was amazing.  Republic really needs to release this series on DVD and really should consider re-running the series on cable.  I'm sure there is a whole new group of people waiting to see just how special this series really is.",1104537600,7,653,4.75

8214761,4,6303540236,"A friend of the tunnel dwellers is being forced into an arranged marriage with a man she doesn't love, and kept away from the man she does love.  For helping her out the tunnel dwellers face the wrath of an organized crime  faction from Chinatown.  For invading the tunnels the criminals face the  wrath of Vincent.  Through watching a couple in love battle obstacles to  achieve their union, Vincent and Catherine have occasion to ponder the  circumstances that keep THEM apart, not least of which at a wedding where  they pay a lot more attention to each other than to the bride and groom.  ""China Moon"" finishes strongly with an emotional scene between  Vincent and Catherine (not unusual for the series).
In 1998 I conducted a  poll among Beauty and the Beast fans asking them to rate the 44 episodes of  the first two seasons on a 1-to-10 scale.  31 fans participated.  ""China Moon"" finished 32nd out of the 44 episodes.
I placed  ""China Moon"" 22nd in my own personal 1-through-44 rank-ordering  of the episodes.",960422400,6,1017,4.725714285714286
