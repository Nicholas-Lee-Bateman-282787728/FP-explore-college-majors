6356805,3,B004LYWFNG,"""It's okay"" is about the best I can give this zombie film. As you would expect it is a small-budget affair with all the attendant aspects that a small budget creates. It takes place in the sticks so there's no need to show wrecked cars and ruined cities or suburbs, and there is a small cast of non-professional actors. Well, that goes all the way back to Night of the Living Dead, so obviously it doesn't preclude making a good film. I've seen all kinds of indie films and can make the allowances you need to make to enjoy them. I really don't like it when some reviews of an indie zombie flick compare it to the successful big budget offerings of the genre as if budget s didn't make a difference. Still, all things considered, this film falls short.

First of all there is a general thing. After the glut of zombie films and television presentations a feeling of zombie fatigue seems to be settling in. Let's face it, we really have been there and seen all this before. The zombie concept, revolutionary as it originally was, is a very limited plot device. It's a wonderful monster, this unthinking, ravenous, unnatural force of nature but you can only do so much with it. You can be holed up somewhere with them attacking, fighting them here or there, or have the zombies be more of a backdrop to groups of survivors in conflict fighting each other whether within one group or between groups. The one innovation was speeding them up by making them ""infected"" rather than undead, and that makes them more dangerous but also robs them of their eeriness and makes them ultimately, as one person said, enraged soccer fans. But either way the plot choices face the same limitations.

That's what's basically wrong with this film. It's the ""small group of survivors hole up in an isolated farmhouse"" story that we've seen many times before. For this to be really good the plot would have to have some interesting twists or the acting would have to be really good. In fact the story is by the numbers and the acting is excruciatingly amateur. The ""dumb redneck who is a jerk"" is way over the top in the way bad actors always do bad guys over the top, almost to a comic parody level. The kindly grandmother type is so kindly she's busy making fried Coca-Cola for everyone (a cookie like thing) as if there wasn't a zombie apocalypse going on (though you could get away with claiming this is a coping device).  People also do the usual tired dumb things like going down to the dark basement alone...Really?

Filmed in the San Antonio area, the film does start off with promise with a scary encounter in a cornfield, but then sets off in a routine direction. The pace quickens near the end as they learn that the army plans to soon firebomb the entire area. But this is thrown away at the very last moment where the survivors look upon a scene that's full of the cheapest computer-created effects, the type you'd find on a zombie short film made by a gang of teenage boys on You Tube. To just have them looking in the distance would have been so much more effective.",1470960000,2,3060,4.508108108108108

Virtually all follow the same path - ""somehow"" (toxin, mysterious disease, etc) folks begin turning into zombies, panic spreads and we follow the plight of a group of stranded folks with the proper age, ethnic, gender and career attributes.  There's usually a showmance, absurd decisions, lots of predictable action and endless attempts battles with the undead (yawn).

A Killing Strain is not terrible but it is certainly not good.  The acting is not top-rate, slightly amateurish (low budget) but the worst aspect was that virtually every scene has been done before and done much better.

6356917,3,B004LYWFNG,"This was not a great movie but it wasn't horrible. The plot was okay with decent acting, although many of the scenes were completely unrealistic. It begins with a presumably married couple taking a country drive while in route to a short vacation. They begin arguing. This is supposed to be time for the two of them; but he's arranged to meet some clients from work. The car strikes something in the road and causes a flat. The husband gets out to inspect the damage and proceeds to change the tire. While he's replacing the tire, the wife has other ideas. She grabs her camera and begins taking a stroll through a corn field to snap some photos in the unknown location. She eventually enters someones property with a home and then snaps several pictures before turning to go back to the car. She stops to view the photos she'd just taken and recognizes a human figure was standing in the photos that she hadn't seen when snapping them. She zooms in on the image and realizes she took a photo of a standing human figure who appeared to be dead. As she begins running away, the figure chases after her and eventually catches up. The husband finishes the tire change and realizes his wife hasn't returned. He takes the tire tool and enters the cornfield. He finds the camera on the ground, picks it up and continues to look for his wife. He almost immediately finds her as she's being eaten by a zombie. He realizes she's still alive, kills the zombie, picks up his wife and carries her back to the car. The radio suddenly comes on and plays a public service announcement that reports a virus has infected the area and all residents should avoid anyone who might be contaminated. The husband escapes the infected wife and ends up at an abandoned house with boarded windows and doors, while trying to escape zombies that followed him. There's already several people staying inside the house which ironically; has been abandoned for several years but still has remnants of furniture, an operational gas stove and electric lighting but no running water. There's even a stockpile of colas, whiskey and military MRE's stored in the basement. As you can see, the plot is not very realistic. There's no special effects and nothing to scare your pants off, but it is a zombie movie. Enjoy..",1444435200,13,2280,4.646039603960396
