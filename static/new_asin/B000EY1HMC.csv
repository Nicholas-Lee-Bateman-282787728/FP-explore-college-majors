8115680,4,B000EY1HMC,"This documentary was cheaply made, but it was not too bad. It was entertaining to hear how people are living on the edge; basically held captive by their gambling addiction. No really big name people in this documentary and there was actually only a handful of ""bustouts"" covered in the documentary. I'm sure a little work would have uncovered even more people living this way.

It would have been interesting for the filmmakers to find online players living paycheck to paycheck to keep playing. The people covered were old players who have seemed to been around the game forever and never been on the lucky side of the cards. Poor money management, impulse control issues, or just lack of poker talent have led these men to a low place in life. What may be the saddest part of this documentary is that none of them even seemed the realize it. Bumming money to play in the next game and owing money to someone all the time was just part of everyday life.

I have not seen a documentary covering this area before and thought this dvd offered a unique look at what can happen when people lose perspective of their failures. Because it is barely an hour long and the production value is that of a home video, I can only give it four stars.",1313798400,,1237,4.493333333333333
8115681,4,B000EY1HMC,"This documentary type video does show some of the seamier side of the poker world - now often very over-glamorized on television.  And there is truth to it, as I have played with most of the people shown.  The unfortunate aspect is that it gives a false impression that this is the low end of this world.  The true low end of this world is much worse - really sorry dogs and very damaged people.  As simple entertainment it is not bad (more realistic than Hollywood's attempts), as reality it is still misleading.",1221523200,,513,4.483870967741935
8115682,4,B000EY1HMC,"This is a specialty DVD that was created, I believe, to coincide with the poker boom that has swept the nation. It purports to tell the downside of being a professional poker player. While there are some serious losers on display here, readers should know that the most famous person presented, Tomer Benvenisti, is not a bust out. He's interviewed to give prospective about ""the life."" He isn't in the gutter and, as we know from ESPN, is an accomplished player. The same can be said of Vinnie Favorito who has a real job and merely plays on the side. Some of the other guys are definitely at the end of their tether though and the examples of Cowboy and Mike Tullis are horrifying. They have been reduced to the status of hobohood. On the whole, the DVD is valuable and quite educational, but it is wise to remember that these tales are not universal. You can see a certain emotionality and defeatism prevalent in many of these fellows. Despite being staked and given a ton of chances, they never seem to make it. Many have nothing in the way of bankroll management skills, and are unable to control their impulses. The future will not be bright for those tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Although, there are three important things to remember, which aren't mentioned here, about those who opt to become poker professionals: 1. The rake online is half; usually only 5 percent as opposed to 10 percent in a casino, 2. There are no tips owed to dealers or waitresses online, 3. You can multi-table games which cuts down on the boredom that results in stupid plays, and it also provides more money making opportunities.",1144281600,6,1623,4.619377162629758
