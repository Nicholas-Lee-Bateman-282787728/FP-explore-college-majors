8678737,5,B00NJX1G0S,Spanish BluRay release.  One of my all time favorite films with a fantastic early career score  by Jerry Goldsmith.  If you liked North by Northwest  the screenplay was by Ernest Lehman who also penned The Prize.  It is almost a remake.,1524614400,,236,4.658536585365853
8678738,5,B00NJX1G0S,"I've been waiting for the blu-ray version of Metro Goldwyn Mayer's The Prize and this Spanish version ifullfills my expectations in all ways.  First it should play just fine on blu-ray players in the U.S. and the blu-ray version is decidedly sharper than the DVD version.  One of my favorite films from The Sixties - great story with plenty of intrigue (screenplay by Ernest Lehman (Screenwriter of North By Northwest); featuring some of the best actors of the time - Paul Newman, Elke Sommer (at her best), Edward G. Robinson and an International cast;  filmed on location in and around Stockholm Sweden.  Highly Recommended.",1481414400,,626,4.990384615384615
