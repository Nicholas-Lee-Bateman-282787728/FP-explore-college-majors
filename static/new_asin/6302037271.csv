420579,1,6302037271,Excellent if you like this sort of thing. Great acting with the unique touch oh Edgar Allen Poe. Nice work,1379548800,,106,4.35
420580,3,6302037271,A good movie to put on the tv to sleep by. Turn the sound down and set the tv to shut off in 80 min.s and sleep like a baby.,1378425600,,124,3.1666666666666665
420581,3,6302037271,"kind of old but interesting.  Looks like it was colorized.  A little dramatic, for the time, very well done. Thanks",1377648000,,115,4.7
420582,1,6302037271,Not worth the time to watch it. Tedious and difficult to follow. It does a very real disservice to Poe.,1372636800,,103,4.2
420583,1,6302037271,"Edgar Allen Poe probably composed his famous script, ""Never more"" after watching this Turkey. Don't buy this movie! There must be better versions of this classic mystery.",1367452800,2,170,5.333333333333333
420584,1,6302037271,The movie was suppose to be the original with Bela Lugosi but instead was a 1970 production with Jason Robards!!,1363305600,3,112,4.65
420585,2,6302037271,"I'm sure there are many who will enjoy this movie but it just wasn't my ""cup of tea"". Very dated look, stiff performances, and not enough going on to encourage me to tough it out to the end.",1362441600,,190,4.026315789473684
420616,2,6302037271,"boring, plodding, Poe at his worst.",1413676800,,35,5.0
420617,5,6302037271,This movie has always been one of my favorites. They just don't write or make pictures like they did in the old days. Everything has to be too gory these days.,1408320000,,159,4.161290322580645
420618,1,6302037271,Don't waste your time...didn't even watch the whole thing.,1405123200,,58,5.555555555555555
420619,1,6302037271,So far off the book it shouldn't even have the same name.  I couldn't get into it once I realized hor different it was.,1399420800,,119,3.9583333333333335
420620,1,6302037271,"I could not even finish watching this horrible (felt like made for tv) movie.  Very dated and had that horrible 70's feel.  I love Poe so I would just say I was stupid to think his works could be somehow made into a great film.  The acting was horrible - ugh, I don't want to think about it.  Great Poe story and my opinion is just read Edgar Allan Poe.  Forget these low budget 70 and 80s films. There are a bunch of these out there and I should have grabbed the Stephen King book I was reading earlier and finished that instead of wasting even 10 minutes on this movie.",1396742400,,571,4.108108108108108
420621,3,6302037271,"I thought I would be watching the ""usual"" Murders in the Rue Morgue.  This was not that film, which is OK - sometimes it's good to see something unexpected.  However, this film was mediocre at best.  Jason Robards is a fine actor but he must have needed the money to have accepted this role.",1395360000,,291,4.351851851851852
420622,5,6302037271,awesome movie does not resemble the book as closely as id like but it will do. i love edgar allan poe.,1394064000,,102,3.9047619047619047
420623,1,6302037271,Every aspect of this movie is sub-par. No redeeming qualities. Robards performed like a cigar store indian.  And the dwarf?!,1391126400,,124,5.2
420624,1,6302037271,Poor acting. Looks like it was done by a couple of high school kids. Don't waste you time with this.,1389657600,,100,4.05
420625,5,6302037271,"Even though the movie is old, It is still a great Poe story.  No one writes them like he does.  The story keeps you guessing until the end!",1388793600,,139,3.9285714285714284
7820666,2,6302037271,"This was hard to sit through. I did it primarily because of Jason Robards. I had never seen him in a really bad movie until this one. Other than the name, this movie has very little in common with Edgar Allan Poe.",1500336000,,213,4.095238095238095
7820667,5,6302037271,This is a 5 star classic movie! Its awesome!,1486684800,,44,4.0
7820668,1,6302037271,Even talented Robards could not help schlocky re-telling of Poe.,1485129600,,64,5.5
7820669,3,6302037271,"It was ok like a B rated movie. I wanted to not watch it after the first murder, but I thought I had seen Christopher Lee in the audience at the 13:01 mark. I fast forwarded through some mundane scenes that didn't seem to add to the story. I mostly kept watching to see a glimpse of who I thought might have been Christopher Lee. I saw that same audience member again at 1:24:51 as well. It sure looks like Christopher Lee.",1483660800,,423,4.170731707317073
7820670,4,6302037271,Good movie good plot,1478217600,,20,4.25
7820671,1,6302037271,This was NOT good and randomly matched the book,1476403200,,47,4.333333333333333
7820672,3,6302037271,"good movie, didn`care for repeated flashbacks",1475712000,,45,6.666666666666667
7820673,3,6302037271,Entertaining but predictable,1447632000,,28,8.666666666666666
7820674,3,6302037271,"Sorry, I was brought up on the Phantom of the Rue Morgue.  This is ok but not the better of the two!",1433721600,,100,3.5454545454545454
