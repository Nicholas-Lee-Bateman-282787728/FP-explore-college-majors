4860823,1,B005R1X6QW,"Really boring, very slow moving, did not care about the characters at all. The plot line seemed thin at best",1381104000,,108,4.45
4860824,2,B005R1X6QW,"Sorry but I 'm a Brit and I've watched lots of seventies movies, err..i mean films and this one had to be one of the worst that I took the time to sit through. Admittedly I did fast forward more toward the end as time was getting on and it was rather slow. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone. The actors and actresses used were o.k. but using some original period music from known artistes would have held me more maybe. The storyline is rather thin although it did actually reflect the time's of the period and the actions of the youth back then.  If you are intrigued then do watch, but watch at your peril. !!",1378944000,,620,4.254237288135593
4860825,1,B005R1X6QW,"What a waste of time! This movie is not entertainingly bad, its boring bad.  The acting is awful; the plot, nonexistent.  It would seem to be a morality play without a moral.  The behavior of the characters is incomprehensible.  The production values are amateurish.  One the plus side, it was free; unfortunately, I felt like the producers should have paid me for watching this junk.",1378339200,,384,4.846153846153846
4860826,2,B005R1X6QW,Not impressed with the direction of this movie.  The plot was very weak and very disjointed in my opinion.  I would not recommend this movie.,1378166400,,141,4.6
4860827,1,B005R1X6QW,"Since Mr. Cooksey has provided a rundown of BFI's Blu-ray contents, I'll focus on the package's main feature: Essentially a plotless, 90-minute acid-rock music montage/psychedelic cautionary tale, 'Permissive' is as much a test of one's nerves as it is an exploitative ode to London's vacuous hippie-era groupie culture. That isn't to say there isn't something for certain tastes-- a snapshot of Britain's seedier side circa 1970; abundant nudity and passionless softcore sex; omnipresent soundtrack by and gig footage of, among other noisemakers, a really hairy bar band called Forever More, which could as easily have been named Jerry Garcia Fronting Led Zeppelin and They Only Know Four Songs (later to re-form as The Average White Band!)-- but for the sentient moviegoer, this is independent filmmaking at its most dreary and self-indulgent. Poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly written, poorly conceived, 'Permissive' earns 1/2 star for a couple down-and-dirty guitar riffs by my new favorite gaggle of unwashed electric minstrels. Print looks decent in hi-def, considering its grainy 35mm source, and sound quality is very good.",1367971200,9,1131,5.505747126436781

4860831,3,B005R1X6QW,"Bleak look at a distant time period. Lindsay Shonteff's Permissive (1970) is not a film that many viewers today will enjoy for its subject matter. In fact the producers of the film were not expecting such a realistic portrayal of the late '60's London music scene with its listless groupies following bands in hopes of being close to someone who could become famous.
I have read many of the reviews on this site and feel that the power of this independent film by one of England's most eclectic low budget directors lies in its brutal portrayal of a London that very few tourists see. Filmed in the West End we don't see the double decker buses and happy Picadilly crowds listening to the latest British Invasion superstars. We get the hangers on following the working bands of the day. It was not a glamorous life, far from it. Life in a working band on the road was hard. It was lonely and it was dirty. Traveling in a van from one gig to the next, staying in seedy hotels, trying to find pleasure in whatever way one could. This is not life with the Stones or Zepplin but rather with Forever More.
The performances capture some of the hopelessness that these groupies felt. The performance by Maggie Stride hits the mark. Life on the road was a struggle to get by. You do what you can to find happiness. Often the groupies were used and then thrown aside. This may be the story that rock does not want its viewers to see. It is closer to the truth than many of us want to know. No it's not a great film. It's not a fun film but it does present a slice of life that we don't really know about and it makes us want to avert our eyes. No matter how you see the film it presents an historical picture of a time and place that is now gone. It is worth watching for that reason alone.
BFI has done us a service by restoring this lost film for a new audience. The visual transfer is as good as it's going to get. The soundtrack is by the band Comus and other at the time program rock bands. If you are a fan of that musical type you will welcome the onstage footage.  The film may be hard to like but it is worth seeing as a record of a lost Britain.",1416787200,4,2146,4.196125907990314

4860834,4,B005R1X6QW,"I can understand the disappointed reviews, given that many viewers are probably going into this expecting a groovy skinflick. And while there's plenty of skin on display, it generally isn't meant to titillate. Permissive has the feel of a documentary in its detached, bleak portrait of a group of people moving like zombies through their empty lives, all set against a London in sharp decline. To that end, there isn't much of a plot and the performances are uniformly low-key. The music scene shown here isn't a glamorous, non-stop party, but a succession of boring road trips, perfunctory hook-ups in cheap hotels, and whatever pointless drama the dysfunctional gang manufactures.

But is it art? Permissive is still a cheap indie movie. Boom mics dip into several shots, and some of the non-actors give very non-actory performances. But the sum is a lot more than the parts. At its most basic, it's a twisted rags-to-riches story about naive Suzy's integration into the scene. But what the movie shows-- without being either preachy or melodramatic-- is that the scene isn't much more than a magnet for the lost, the emotionally stunted, the mentally ill, and (in the form of the group's aging manager) those who are more than happy to exploit them. Add to that an absolute ton of footage of 1970 London, and it all adds up to an unusually thoughtful little film that benefits all the more for its matter-of-fact approach to the material. The definition of a hidden gem, as long as you know what you're getting into.",1399593600,11,1519,4.864864864864865

4860838,3,B005R1X6QW,This movie was set in the 70's. It needs a remake. The story plot is very good but poor acting. Has plenty of T and A and lots of explicit sex seens. But acting and sound are terrible. Would like to see it remade with modern stars. Leave all  the sex and nudity in it.,1382572800,10,268,3.8727272727272726
