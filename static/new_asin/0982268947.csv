What struck me in this fascinating episode was how deliberate and methodical under-painting should be. I'd say it reminded me of the value of values. This DVD is valuable as a process because each brushstroke made sense. It's clear why fresco forces you to consider the process and make no excuses.

iLia kept repeating that he isn't copying his cartoon but was following the values carefully analyzed and drawn on it (Volume 2, ""Cartoon""). It's one thing to hear or read  but invaluable to watch this unfold in real time. He emphasized that he was putting these value layers down according to what the plaster absorbed, at it's own pace, and how the values and form develop because of the thin layering necessary.

What I didn't realize about applying Verdacchio even after doing it was the importance of being sensitive to the porous plaster surface and how it's subtlety must be attended to less you ""break"" the surface, when the lime mixes in with the pigment and you create a muddy instead of transparent layered under-painting. Along with tools and material information, this was a great tip.

 As modern artists we're used to painting on forgiving supports that we can mess around with. Since working in fresco, applying information from this and the other DVD's in the 5-volume set has given my work much more ""punch."" Even if I work abstractly instead of in my usual more realistic style, I'm much more conscious of the impact created by thinking through my values and constructing them beforehand, not muddling about while painting.

I highly recommend this DVD to all artists, beginners or professionals. We can all use reminders, and this one was easy to watch and absorb. I'm sure I'll be using it for reference frequently.",1377993600,,1991,5.444805194805195
