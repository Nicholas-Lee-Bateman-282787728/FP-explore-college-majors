4696073,5,B005GYSUYI,"I bought this for my husband after we loaned out his Band of Brothers set and never got it back.  It was an anniversary gift and did not disappoint.  The box opens/folds out and is accordian-style.  The graphics are really good and overall it looks awesome.  We're actually glad we ""lost"" the other set because this one is much nicer.",1325721600,,334,4.516666666666667
4696074,5,B005GYSUYI,"Took awhile to find this, couldn't get it in stores anywhere, so when I finally found it I took it, it's a Christmas gift for my father, packaging is great, came in an orderly fashion, I'm pleased with it",1325548800,,204,4.256410256410256
4696075,5,B005GYSUYI,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday this year. He loves Band of Brothers but we've never ended up buying it on DVD.
My husband has really enjoyed this boxed set - the special features and behind-the-scenes footage was really interesting and he has watched most of it.
The packaging is put together nicely. My only complaint about the whole thing is the packaging doesn't fit well with the other DVD's on our shelves. In the picture it looks like 2 different boxes, but it's one large one.
We love the content though, and that's what counts!",1325548800,,550,4.565656565656566
4696076,5,B005GYSUYI,Had the separate sets but this made a perfect package gift set!  Son loved it.  Great set of movie series to watch on a cold rainy day or anytime.  Full of history.  Highly recommended.  Good looking packaging also.,1325203200,2,215,4.552631578947368

4696078,5,B005GYSUYI,"This item was a complete hit with by 16 year old, she loved it. The only problem is Band of Brothers came with 2 copies of disk 3 and no disk 2.

4696079,5,B005GYSUYI,"I bought this for my husband who really enjoys reading history and war books. He was excited when he opened this.

4696127,5,B005GYSUYI,"Band of Brothers is an EXCELLENT series that I have watched multiple times.  The Pacific is a good series as well, though I feel it spends a little too much time off of the battlefront.  That, along with the well established fact that you don't create the same personal relationship with the men keeps it from being the excellence that is B.o. B.  Of course, this is just my opinion, and opinions do vary.",1513468800,,405,4.445945945945946

4696142,5,B005GYSUYI,"Outstanding presentation of the original HBO series that I missed. when it came out.  Ten plus hours of a great true story about this small battle group during WW II and the horrors of war that they endured.  The cinematography and special effects were awesome ! Actors and backdrops were extraordinary!. Interviews with some of the real paratroopers that survived made it all the more real and important.

I look forward to watching The Pacific Special Edition after I ""digest"" the Band of Brothers.

4696230,5,B005GYSUYI,"It is unbelievable how well this show stands the test of time. After watching it for the first time years ago, I was astonished at the quality of the series. The acting was top notch, and many of the actors were made famous by this show. for people I had never seen or heard of, I was absolutely stunned by their performance. I think their choice to use unknown actors was for the best, because you don't go into the show with any preconceived notions, or thoughts about past roles and performances. The story doesn't pull any punches, as they did not change the truth to make a better story, the best possible story actually happened, and was told faithfully by this series. Their were a few slip ups, due mostly to conflicting accounts, but they are insignificant, and do not detract from the magnificence of this show. You can really see the relationships the soldiers had with one another. You feel their pain, sorrow and joy. There is one scene later on that really hits you hard, I won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it. They do not show a whole lot of most of the casualties, but this is because they obviously did not survive to tell their story as the survivors did. There is only one thing that I would have changed, and many people will disagree with me. I would have made the series longer, it is already almost 11 hours long, but I feel that trying to convey a story spanning years is extremely difficult to convey in even 30 hours. They probably had limitations, both by the material they had to work with, and from HBO, and anything longer was out of the question. The cost was already astronomical, and anything longer would have been even more expensive. I'm still in disbelief of how well they conveyed the story in the time they had, though at times I was disappointed by the gaps in the narrative, especially at Bastogne, when Doc Rowe left to help injured soldiers, and you missed much of the battle. I usually don't like shaky camera work, but I do feel it adds to this show, as it almost makes you feel like you are actually there, not just watching in your living room. The battle scenes in general were extremely well done, and were stunningly realistic and heart pounding. You held your breath when they were outnumbered, or being fired on, you sighed in relief when they made it through. The one thing it does not convey as well is the casualties, it focuses on a select few men for obvious reasons. By the end of the war, they had taken 150% casualties, a staggeringly high number. The interviews are one of my favorite parts of the series, as you can here the real heroes tell their story. It adds a surprising amount of meaning to the show, and foreshadows what is to come in the episode. The interviews, especially in episode 10 tug on your heart strings, and it just means more coming from the men who saw it themselves. They truly were the greatest generation, and this show shows you why.",1465516800,5,2935,4.4572490706319705

4696253,1,B005GYSUYI,"Don't waste your time or money on bad writing and mediocre acting with just enough action to keep you from nodding off. Both of these series are just riding the coattails of saving private ryan, but in a watered down version hanging on Spielberg and hanks political views of men at war. Both series continually focus on the few  dissenting or cowardly soldiers/Marines who s*** thier pants while only one hero saves the day B.S. They need to take a class from Clint Eastwood on how to make a good action film about war and keep thier ignorant socio-political jargon out.",1461283200,,570,4.643564356435643

4696255,5,B005GYSUYI,Awesome collection!!!!,1459900800,,22,10.5
4696256,5,B005GYSUYI,"If you want to watch some of the best shows ever made, look no further than this collection.  While HBO has a history of very well made and prolific series, I would consider Band of Brothers and The Pacific as two of the best.  Both set during World War II, Band of Brothers follows an airborne unit throughout the war in the European theater (France and Germany mostly), while The Pacific follows a marine unit in the Pacific theater.  The shows very much give a similar vibe to Saving Private Ryan, which makes sense when you notice that they were made by a majority of the same people including Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.  As you would expect from these creative minds and an HBO show, the production values are top notch, with superb acting from all the cast to boot.  While I am a history buff of all things World War II, I would personally consider Band of Brothers to have a stronger focus as a character piece and the camaraderie of the unit, while The Pacific has more of an action movie feel to it.  That isn't to say that the former lacks action, as both display the grotesque and awe of war as few other shows or even movies do.  Overall I cannot recommend this set highly enough.  I have owned both shows since they first came out, then later upgraded the the blu-ray sets due to the superior visuals and sound.  I have also bought this set for at least 3 other friends and relatives, and they too have not been disappointed.",1459814400,,1443,4.394736842105263

As a former US Marine, and self considered novice Military Historian and Leaders, I found this series very intriguing. Especially the interviews of the survivors / brave men and women. I even looked up and read most of the brave men that were portrayed in the movie on Wikipedia. Very interesting true to life stories.

4696328,5,B005GYSUYI,"Both of these series should receive 6 stars. My favorite is Band of Brothers as I think it did a better job of detailing the emotional roller coaster these soldiers lived minute by minute.  Both do an excellent job of portraying the realities of each battle, war, and loss.

4696390,3,B005GYSUYI,The Band of Brothers tells a true story of Easy Company in the 101st Airborn Division.  As a grown man I'm not scared to say I cried to this one.  One of the greatest war stories ever.  However; its only getting 3 stars because its paired with The Pacific.  A series told 10 years after the production of Band of Brothers with a whole different feel.  I couldn't get past the fifth episode and while I'll most likey finish the series just for the hell of it; I couldn't stand the modern day production mixed with a poor attempt of capturing the past.  The story was more focused on a few individuals while the cast of BOB was more diverse and showed multiple view points.,1433721600,,671,4.328

4696412,5,B005GYSUYI,"Band of Brothers and The Pacific, two ground-breaking, emotional, triumphant and phenomenal series that cover two sections of World War II; the European Theater and the Pacific Theater. produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, both shows are considered to be not only two of the best representations of WWII in terms of filmmaking (I say filmmaking because, while they're seen as miniseries, they're basically extended movies), but incredible in every way possible, from the direction and writing to the acting and the production values. Saving Private Ryan, arguably the best WWII film, pales in comparison when looking at these two works. I won't detail their synopses, since information can be found pretty much anywhere, but i'll talk about their merits and the differences between the two.

Band of Brothers, an emotional powerhouse that puts you in the shoes of Easy Company dropping into Normandy from the skies, with a group of men that fight not just for the world and their country, but for each other. With gripping performances from Damian Lewis, Donnie Wahlberg, Kirk Acevedo, Ron Livingston and a slew of other actors throughout the series. What makes Band of Brothers even more incredible, though, isn't just the production, visuals, or direction, but how you come to love nearly every character, including the small parts as they all come together and fight in such a horrific and gruesome war that defied reason. The Pacific differs from Band of Brothers not just in it focusing on the Pacific Theater of War instead of the European Theater, but that it lessens (just a tad), your love for the characters to show the effects war has on the psyche, the sheer brutality, relentless terror and violence. You still come to love and feel for characters, just not as quickly. Also, The Pacific does have the feeling of being grander and bolder, but not better. Both miniseries are brilliant, haunting, epic and outstanding in every department, with both outdoing one another in a single area.

The blu-ray box set has some of the best video and audio technical specs to ever be on blu-ray, and if you do not yet own either series, this is a must-own. It also comes with a bonus feature that doesn't come with either series separately, called ""He Has Seen War,"" a 54-minute documentary that's extremely well-put together and informative. Here's to hoping Spielberg and Hanks team up again with HBO to deliver one more WWII series that focuses on the North African campaign of WWII, as it could complete their World War II Saga, similar to Clint Eastwood's Battle of Iwo Jima film saga.",1429315200,,2598,4.929223744292237
4696413,5,B005GYSUYI,Everything about this is wonderful.  It looks and sounds great in my home theater.  Can't believe that anyone actually made a series this good about WW II.,1428451200,,155,4.703703703703703

Personal preference: I did not enjoy The Pacific film as much as Band of Brothers. I didn't buy in to the John Basilone character; he seemed too stiff & choreographed for my tastes &, as a result, the episodes in which he was depicted fell flat. I also didn't appreciate what I thought was the gratuitous sex scenes. Were they necessary to the plot? Hardly.",1425513600,,557,4.742268041237113

When he unrapped the plastic and opened the main box that contained book of DVDs, the sides of the box were ripped. Now we have to be careful when we place the book back in so in won't rip any more than it is.
Everything else was perfect it's a great gift the only reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because the condition of the main box was in when he unrapped it.",1422144000,,534,3.9537037037037037

4696461,5,B005GYSUYI,"Band of Brothers is freaking FANTASTIC lets just get that out of the way first.  Its a great true telling of the story of the 506th E company during WWII.  Blue Ray really brings this to life.  I have yet to watch The Pacific but if it is even half as good as BoB then I will be delighted.

the gift set here is an extremely high quality box.  It is a top open/close with a magnetic catch on it.  Once you open it you are met with a ""book"" containing all of the discs to the shows.  Even this ""book"" feels robust and of good quality.

I would highly recommend this as a gift, or to purchase for ones self if you do not already own one or the other on Blue Ray.
In my case I already had the DVD set of B.o. B.  However I was wanting Blue Ray for quite some time.  I stumbled upon this combo and was instantly adding to cart and checking out.

BoB is really a must watch for everyone who is interested in some of the specifics of WWII and the key battles it involved including D-Day, Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge. The packaging for this is first class and the item shipped in a heavy cardboard protection to protect it as another layer of protection - so I'm very please with it. Like to also add that the contents of this Blu-ray include the interactive field guide or timeline which makes a re-watching of the show especially interesting since you get a lot of added information behind the actual events the episodes portray. The only thing I wish it had was added audio commentary for each show as it would have been nice to hear production details for such an epic series, instead there is only one making of documentary, which is not bad.

The Pacific was done differently than Band Of Brothers and at first, I was a bit disappointed with it but after watching the complete first part of it, I was hooked and wanted to see all parts and loved it as much as Band Of Brothers.

4696504,5,B005GYSUYI,"As a baby boomer and having known family members who suffered and experienced the death of loved ones in the Pacific, I can only say that this WWII generation is the greatest generation of our nation.  Watching these two series of the young men of that time who suffered, lived through and died in this war only made me cry out in gratitude for their sacrifices.

These two series are so realistic in their portrayal of those times but I am sure the actual reality for those who experienced these acts of war was far more horrific and soul scaring than we can ever imagine.  I encourage all to watch both of these depictions of WWII for never was our country so united and so dedicated to these young men.  And, never have the men of our nation been so overwhelmingly dedicated to defending our country.

As Japan celebrated their success in the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the architect of the attack, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, worried that the triumph would be short lived as he spoke the now famous words, ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.""  And, so the giant awoke.

4696509,5,B005GYSUYI,"One of the best conceived tributes to those who gave their lives to save the free world from one of two dictators.  I much preferred ""the Pacific over Band of Brothers"" because, at least for me, it presented a more intimate character presentation.  The Pacific theater was so vast, that it is impossible to cover fully in a dramatic series, but the preludes to the episodes and the accompanying specials highlight the surviving troop's thankfulness that someone finally attempted to tell their story, with renditions of the European theater being plentiful.  It contains some of the most vivid realistic battle scenes drawn and the 5.1 sound makes them even more gripping.  A marvelous achievement.",1404864000,,698,5.0964912280701755

4696545,5,B005GYSUYI,I served for 24 years in the Army and I believe this movie captures the the whole experience better than any other.  From the terror of war to the boredom (and soldiers getting into trouble) of waiting.  Great acting and hearing from the real soldiers is very special.  I am just very impressed every time I watch it.,1398988800,3,317,4.431034482758621
4696546,5,B005GYSUYI,"What can I say, except for just WOW!  Band of Brothers is probably one of the greatest documentaries/films/shorts/whatever you want to call it that I have ever seen.  I wish that my schools would have taught me some of this stuff growing up because I would have found class a whole lot more interesting.  The hell that these guys in Band of Brothers and the Pacific is just mind numbing, and as I have always felt, we should be treating out Vets with a whole lot more respect than they get.  These are the heroes of America and who keep us going and who have built us up, and they deserve A LOT more.

The quality of these movies are fantastic, as they are Blu Ray, and the sound quality is perfect as well.  The packaging is pretty cool too as the inlays on each page are on very sturdy material and the pictures included on each in lay are perfectly clear and just fantastic.  I wish I would have watched these years ago, and have not seen them until I bought this recently, and I loved Band of Brothers with the utmost love.  I would give Band of Brothers a 10/10, but I would give the Pacific a 6/10.  It was just an alright series, but maybe it was just because Band of Brothers was so incredibly amazing, that anything after will only be sub par.  It seemed like you cannot connect with the characters as well in the Pacific as you could in Band of Brothers.

But none the less, if you like HBOs work, then this will not let you down.",1398643200,,1440,4.218978102189781

I'm under 18, and before, I'm not really fond of joining the military, but after watching the dramatization of world war 2 and these noble men,  I'm considering of doing it. It's an overwhelming miniseries, both the Band Of Brothers and The Pacific. I like the Pacific more, prolly because I saw it first before BoB. Already told my friends who haven't seen both of the tv miniseries to watch them. If you saw the two miniseries already and wanting to purchase, buy this one. The box is very well finished and it gives you this premium feeling. Plus, it has some good special bonus features that are quite extraordinary. Watch the Band of Brothers for the European theater of WW2, the Pacific for the Pacific theater of war. They're phenomenal.",1398470400,,888,4.6923076923076925

BOB is based on the heroic deeds of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division...true American heroes...their experiences brought to this generation by the author Stephen Ambrose. The Pacific is based on the writings of members of the 1st Marine Division: Robert Leckie (Helmet for my Pillow) and Eugene Sledge (With the old Breed). I own this set because it reminds me of the reasons I served...it reminds me of the adults in my neighborhood when I was growing up...and it reminds me of what made America great.

The story of Easy Company of the US Army 101st Airborne division and their mission in WWII Europe from Operation Overlord through V-J Day. Drama, suspenseful, and gripping war action. The DVD includes life profiles of the actual participants of Easy Company. Interviews are with some of the military participants, their family and friends.

Pacific is much the same. These are films I think any man could watch over and over and never tire of them. And I believe women would get a lot out of them to.

There are characters in these series that teach manhood by giving examples of real men. Men willing to give their all for the greater good, men willing to lay their lives down for their friends..

Beautiful stories of heroism. These men are real heroes.

I just happen to be that guy that likes original cases and packaging.  I'd buy again, for a gift of for myself if I ever lose my current set somehow.  As far as the shows themselves go... The first time I saw Band of Brothers was many years ago, and it was then and still is now one of the finest presentations of not just WWII but also war in general that I've seen.

I started by watching a war movie, but finished by experiencing a deep emotional attachment to the characters. There was no glory of war or glamor of violence. This was a journey through the best and worst moments of these soldiers' lives, and we the audience got to experience these moments intimately.

Never has a war movie been put together like this one.",1335744000,,263,3.888888888888889
4696846,5,B005GYSUYI,"First of all: I waited to get both Band of Brothers and the Pacific together and this box set was perfect for me. It was only slightly more expensive than buying each series individually but the box is of great quality and the blu rays look great as well. I haven't seen the exclusive documentary yet but I plan to soon.

I had seen Band of Brothers many times over the years but never the Pacific for some reason. After enjoying Band of Brothers for the 10th time when I got this box set, I watched the Pacific. I think part of the appeal of Band of Brothers is that you can watch it many, many times and it gets better everytime. You start to relate with the characters and understand their plights. When you watch something for the first time, it's kinda hard to remember who is who under their helmets or why you should care. That's how I felt during the Pacific. Only watched it once but I found it hard to care like I did with Band of Brothers. Now that being said, there is no doubt in my mind that I will watch it again and there is also no doubt that it will grow on me further.

Both series are absolutely incredible. What I said above about the Pacific was just a nitpicking personal experience. Taken alone, each EPISODE could be it's own movie. The production qualities are fantastic and the action is amazing. Much better than many movies today.

And the blu rays quality and sound is astronomical. I would often turn to my girlfriend and go ""Look at the detail on the jacket!!!"" or ""SURROUND SOUND!!"" when bullits were flying through the rear speakers on Pelilieu in the Pacific.

Great box set. HIGHLY recommended.",1334880000,46,1630,4.40531561461794
4696847,1,B005GYSUYI,"WARNING TO HBO CUSTOMERS:

After purchasing this set on bluray I discovered that I received a redundant copy of disc 3 of Band of Brothers and that disc 2 was missing. After contacting customer support they told me I had to mail the redundant disc to a third party to have a new disc sent. I followed their instructs and three months later I still have no response from this third party, the CI-Group. HBO Customer Service claims they have no way of contacting this third party other then their address. So now I am stuck with an incomplete set of discs, since the set has been opened, it cannot be returned to Amazon.com, and because it is missing a disc, it has no resale value.

Here is my correspondence with HBO Customer Service:

To be abundantly clear, there was no consumer-caused damage to any disc and the set was authentic, purchased through Amazon.com; the media I purchased contained two copies of disc 3 and no copy of disc 2 of band of brothers on Bluray. Your refusal to help me in this matter is very disturbing as there is no phone number or email address to contact the ""CI-Group"" to which I have been directed and who have not issued me a copy of the disc I have requested despite my having mailed them the redundant copy.

I don't understand how you can use the CI-Group to issue replacement discs if you cannot contact them, this is unacceptable and not what I would consider customer service. Now I am left with an incomplete set, out of pocket.

Please provide me a direct contact on this matter, I've been patient with
this issue, but simply telling me I've contacted the wrong department does
not help me. Please redirect me to the correct department and contact.

The bonus features on each disc allow for an even better understanding of how these particular units contributed to their respective operations.  The background and other materials on the bonus disc was quite enjoyable as well.

I would recommend this set to anyone. Likely, if you enjoy BOB, you'll like THE PACIFIC. Spend the extra money and get the set of both, we're glad we did!

The immortal phrase from Winston Churchill's dictum in the House of Commons on August 20, 1940 on the Battle of Britain is applicable to the American fighting men portrayed in Band of Brothers and The Pacific: ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."" Our brave soldiers fought valiantly and suffered  much in World War II to defeat worldwide fascism. They paid the ultimate price and should never be forgotten.",1327622400,2,546,4.628865979381444

While any can see these 2 films well deserve the accolades laid at their door, there is an improvement on the wings I believe would be very meaningful. This is in the editing. Edit the two films together into one film by timeline. This would give viewers an idea of what was happening on one front and the other at the same times. Besides a more world view of the war as seen from the two theaters, I also think it would give an additional emotional depth to the Pacific veteran stories of fighting and then coming home a more poignant and sorrowful ring.
