8738715,5,B00726IF16,This DVD was done well to explain mushing to non-mushing folks.  I do run dogs and I in fact got a second copy to be able to loan the first copy to friends so they can see and learn a bit about what I do and what it takes.  Donna Quante did a good job filming and producing this video with the thought of covering one musher and his team as they proceed through the race.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone wishing to learn something about this sport.,1380844800,,454,4.022222222222222
