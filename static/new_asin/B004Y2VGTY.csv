8447896,3,B004Y2VGTY,Nothing against Marco Olmo but the movie was a bit disappointing how it was put together.  Seems very solemn in parts of it.  He was an amazing runner should have been more upbeat.,1415923200,,180,4.424242424242424
8447897,5,B004Y2VGTY,"We decided to carry this DVD in north america, because Marco is an amazing runner who is not well known over here in the US.  Though it is kind of a sad story, we love the look at Marco's life as a construction worker and who he is beyond his running.  The music is also very inspiring as well.",1386720000,,294,3.9661016949152543
8447898,3,B004Y2VGTY,"But, I wonder why this DVD is not about the years when MArco was a winner, not only her last years !",1372636800,,100,3.590909090909091
8447899,4,B004Y2VGTY,well done and it shows different aspects of Marco Olmo's personality. I liked because it is not only focused on his racing career but also on how he become an untramarathon runner,1370390400,,179,4.625
8447900,1,B004Y2VGTY,"I love these types of movies. I can watch them hundreds of times for the training, scenery, event, people, etc. But this movie started slow then went backwards from there. Really disappointed as it could have been special and drawn me in with the story. Oh well you can't win them all.",1369699200,,285,4.5
