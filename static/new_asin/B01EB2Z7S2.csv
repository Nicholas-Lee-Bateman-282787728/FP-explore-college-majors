8758267,2,B01EB2Z7S2,"The three operas, Aleko, The Miserly Knight, and Francesca da Rimini, are staged with similar principles: The orchestra is on stage, the principals are almost static on a big stair case, the customs are strange to say the least, and the producer intends to use lighting to create the movement and staging effect.  If not for that lighting and the customs, they could be characterized as semi-staged operas as have been seen at Carnegie Hall and other venues. Aleko and The Miserly Knight are based on Alexander Pushkin writings, while Francesca is based on Dantes Devine Comedy.  These are short operas written at different stages of Rachmaninovs life.  Their commonality in terms of plot and music score is tenuous at best. Staging them in similar manner doesnt add too much to each one individually or to the troika.
The singers are quite good, but their almost robotic movements and strange customs distract and require so much effort to see that the music seems to be a second priority. The sound recording is fine, but not great. Francesca has some climatic music that recording doesnt seem to convey strongly enough. In addition, I heard some noise in Francesca (in the surround version) that bothered me, although I couldn't identify it.
In summary, the staircase, the static actors and the lighting did not succeed in conveying the producers intentions for me.  Since there are not many DVD recordings of these operas, this DVD can serve the curious, but should not be taken as representative of these compositions.",1497225600,,1523,4.96078431372549
8758268,1,B01EB2Z7S2,"I embrace any interpretations of classical operas when it is done in good taste and with good knowledge of the original stuff.  The two pieces of Rachmaninovs Troika are based on works of the colossal talent of Russian literature Alexander Pushkin and the third on Dante.  Rachmaninov  used  all the  works of literary geniuses  to give  them  second great  life  in music.  Apparently the producers of Troika hardly even read them and mutilated everything to  the degree of vandalism.  Not a trace of the original ideas were left in this nightmarish phantasmagoria.  Especially terrifyingly absurd were the costumes  (apparently the designers of this production  worked  under the leadership of Mad Hatter).  It was so painful to watch how fine opera singers were wasting their fine vocal talents trying to save Rachmanivov, Pushkin and Dante from the barbaric approach of this production.",1486166400,,890,5.191489361702128

This set of discs is likely to split opinion between opera enthusiasts and the fundamental issue will be what is meant by the term opera. This will be discussed in relation to this set of three operas further on during this review.

Firstly, there are non-controversial elements of the set to acknowledge. The recording itself is clearly an HD presentation providing both surround (DTS 5.1) and stereo sound. This is well-balanced and faithfully portrays the presentation of the opera as seen here by delivering a realistically representative sound-stage within which vocal and instrumental timbres are faithfully conveyed. By this stage the composer was very experienced and skilled at handling large forces on a broad canvas and the recording does the music justice. The only regret on these grounds is the lack of a Blu-ray option but the DVD still delivers good quality sound.

On purely musical grounds, Mikhail Tatamikov, the young Russian conductor, clearly has a good grip of the music as does the team of Russian soloists. The Belgian choir have a very limited vocal role to play but do so well. The essential musical and recording considerations are therefore well up to the task.

The production concept and its staging are different issues though and that is where these discs may prove to be controversial. The accompanying booklet is largely focused on the idea that these operas are a visual experience and goes on to deal with issues of light and dark. That is a reasonable view and will not be a matter of concern so far. Opera is indeed a visual experience and the plots are often concerned with dramatic ideas which can be seen as dark and light.

In this case both Aleko and Francesca da Rimini are concerned with marital betrayal related to considerable age differences and the possible consequences. They also deal with set-up situations where the avenging older husband has arranged a situation where unfaithfulness and evidence of betrayal is almost certain to be the result. Puccini deals with a similar age miss-match in his opera il tabarro (the Cloak) and the possible consequences although in that case there are no suggestions of manipulation. The central opera, The Miserly Knight, also deals with a form of betrayal as the elderly miser denies his son access to his fortune. The opera concludes as the miser lies to the local ruler by accusing his own son of an intention to kill him for his money. The son is guiltless. The stress causes the miser to die from a heart attack.

All three of these plots lend themselves to some tense stage action and that can be seen in the superb Glyndebourne production of the Miserly Knight under Jurowski. Here, however, the three operas are staged as essentially motionless vocal works where the drama is intended to be conveyed solely by the use of light displays projected over static tableaux. This will not convince anyone expecting to watch an opera unfolding as a musical play with acting. Even the solo characters in this set fail to face those to whom their words are addressed. They continue to face forwards, isolated. Rachmaninov could never have envisioned such a production, even producing a specific Womens Dance in Aleko, which in this case translates to a dance of light over motionless figures.

So, this is a set that will split opinion. The issue is not one of any musical nature, either in performance or recording. The issue is entirely about the concept of what makes an opera an opera. Good musical values but one has to ask, ""Is this production actually anything to do with what the composer had in mind?""",1473465600,7,3760,4.966613672496026
