Bill and Pat are fantastic.
Thanks for all the hard work you do.",1282435200,,125,4.478260869565218
3681897,5,B001L7Y1M4,"hello i have both vol of ufo hunters on dvd
and i have to say i think they do a great job of research pat and ted do a really good scientific  job,
but i find bill a little far out in some of his thoeries and in some cases hard to believe, all in all i think it was a great show i wish
the history channel would have done more, my favorate season is the 3rd season as there
were newer info that most ufo programs never show like the underground base and nazi germanys
involvment in disc shaped craft, i hope that the 3rd season will come on dvd soon but the first season and also this second
season are really good and well worth the price i expacailly liked the area 51 and the new roswell episodes

3681898,4,B001L7Y1M4,"UFO HUNTERS continues on where it left off. The style is the same, Bill is still annoying, Pat takes the middle road (Slanted towards believing) and Ted plays the eternal skeptic. Ufo Hunters gives a balanced view of the phenomena of UFOs (and USOs) in an entertaining way. It's sometimes repetitive in its information (The curse of filling in after commercials for those who've just tuned in). But there are some pearls of info in there for even the most knowledgeable on the subject.

It appears that the 3rd series was 'axed' mid season, which is a shame, as there are some really great eps in season 3. Hopefully they'll bring it out on DVD soon.",1262822400,11,650,4.603448275862069
3681899,5,B001L7Y1M4,"The program is amazing. They don't simply say that the thing was a UFO. They look for proofs and explanations as it must to be.
The amateurs videos are very good.
If you buy this product be prepared to get into a deep investigation.",1252022400,6,232,4.295454545454546
3681900,4,B001L7Y1M4,"First of all, I have enjoyed watching the series.  I have learned a number of new things, even about old cases.  I enjoy the scientific approach, which is important to figuring out the cases.

I miss the introduction theme music from season one and I miss them getting together back at HQ to wrap up each show.

Production wise, I do think the narration could be tightened up a bit.  Many things from the previous segment are repeated in the next segment.  This is a bit frustrating at times to watch.  Most of viewers have a reasonable memory and don't need to be reminded of what happened in a past segment into the new segment.",1251417600,,630,4.426086956521739

3681902,4,B001L7Y1M4,"I'm a friend of the aliens. The world is, so to speak, a better place 'cause of ""UFO Hunters,""  They do not articulate like we do - they don't talk. Not 'cause the program is, so to speak, particularly good; in fact, the Insectillians, it's as silly and scientifically shaky as a creature feature from the Eisenhower era.. During my nine day visit with the Biaviians aboard the great mothership, But the mere presence of the series means that we collectively have not completely succumbed to, you know, the worship of science and Wall Street, and this is a damned lizard! If even one person is, so to speak, watching this show, very complicated scientific equations, it, the aliens would say, proves that humans can still give themselves over to, you know, the unexplainable, kinetic mind games, the mysterious, the fantastical, until such time that we will no longer need to be encumbered with this physiology that we have here. Through a visual strobe-light, like burst, It means that we have not abandoned the notion that there might be something beyond ourselves, who resemble blonde-haired, blue-eyed humans. Qua Omsa Lagee Wann. Yes,  that's piling a lot of baggage onto ""UFO Hunters,"" but we might as well, kinetic mind games, since otherwise this series doesn't have much excuse for existing, who have a bony, leathery appearance.. When you open the lines of telepathic communication, documentaries and pseudodocumentaries examining old claims of visitations from space have been around forever, and things like this. Most strike the same ominously breathless tone, the Insectillians, and all reach the same vague nonconclusions. The duration of that light burst was approximately twelve seconds. How tired is, so to speak, the genre? Not only did the Sci Fi Channel offer its own program last week using a similar premise, very complicated scientific equations, but -- cue the italic typeface pioneered by the old ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" strip -- it, the aliens would say, also had the exact same title as the History Channel series!!! In the History Channel's offering, kinetic mind games, the investigators are led by Bill Birnes, publisher of UFO Magazine, and this is a damned lizard! The team's opening case, uhhhhhhh, visually witnessed, in the physical, last week, kinetic mind games, was intriguing enough, until such time that we will no longer need to be encumbered with this physiology that we have here.. Hey, look here, It involved a 1947 incident in Washington State in which boaters on Puget Sound claimed to, you know, have visually witnessed, in the physical, hovering aircraft that looked, the Insectillians, at least in the show's re-creation, uh, very complicated scientific equations, like inner tubes, who resemble blonde-haired, blue-eyed humans, And these little jokers are ruling the universe! One inner tube apparently having engine trouble, spewed molten slag down onto the boat and a military plane that came to, you know, retrieve samples of the slag a few days later crashed on its way home, who have a bony, leathery appearance.. During my nine day visit with the Biaviians aboard the great mothership, The History Channel's investigators visited the sites, kinetic mind games, hinted at a lot of possibilities and ultimately clarified none of them, and things like this. O-Qua Tangin Wann. Mr.. Through a visual strobe-light, like burst, Birnes and his colleagues add to, you know, the campy feel of the series by not being very good actors, the Insectillians, trying in vain to, you know, make the discoveries that they no doubt researched ahead of time appear spontaneous on camera.. When you open the lines of telepathic communication, Their awkwardness is, so to speak, good, and this is a damned lizard! It gives the show license to, you know, indulge in all sorts of spurious revelations and disingenuous teasers, uh, very complicated scientific equations, and it, the aliens would say, relieves the audience of the responsibility of taking any of it, the aliens would say, seriously.",1250553600,,4036,5.104387291981846
3681903,5,B001L7Y1M4,"The show is 5 starts, no questions about it.
The only bad thing here is the DVD trasnfers, the show is recorded in HD 16x9, the DVD is on Letterbox 4:3. So there is a lot in lost video quality.",1250208000,3,193,3.85
3681904,5,B001L7Y1M4,They do an excellent job of researching a sighting.  Their method is scientific and un-complicated.  You need not be an expert (I'm certainly not) to understand what they are showing you.  They go to all the actual locations and interview eye witnesses for first hand accounts.  Most of their photos and video-film is first rate and their digitalized representations are clear and sharp.,1247011200,6,387,5.095238095238095
3681905,5,B001L7Y1M4,"The show looks for physical proof, to show that the Earth has been visited by visitors from Outer Space. Their are just to many sightings to dismiss as natural occuring events. Excellent DVD for your Collection.",1246233600,9,211,4.888888888888889

3681911,4,B001L7Y1M4,This is better than season 1. Bill Birnes has backed off a bit from the center stage and toned down his enthusiasm. It is more story and research and less pep talk and hype.,1385078400,,173,4.117647058823529
3681912,4,B001L7Y1M4,"I always liked UFO hunters. They are funny and entertaining, especialy Bill he is such convinced guy, so I feel bad for him. LOL",1372032000,,128,4.375
3681913,5,B001L7Y1M4,I love the way these guys approach the subject of UFO's. They present both sides and try to do experiments to debunk what they can and leave the rest to our imaginations.,1369440000,,170,4.34375
3681914,5,B001L7Y1M4,"I love this show and the series. If you are a UFO buff or just someone interested in hearing and seeing all the unexplained. Bill and his crew do the best job possible and travel the country and parts of the Globe to get you close up and personal accounts and they do their homework on getting the facts. I like Patrick is always logical and looking to disprove, well, he is a person who wants facts, not fantasy and Ted the producer I think does a wonderful job. Bill with his sunglasses and hat makes him an interesting character with his voice and that he never ceased to quit until he exhausts every avenue. But the interesting facts they come up with are what this show is all about. So, if you think you have ever seen something unusual in the skies or coming out of the ocean or want to know more about things like Area 51, you will love this series and want more. I myself can't get enough of this show. 2 thumbs up for the interesting topics they cover, the presentation and all the folks they get that are reputable. If you are still skeptical, watch some of the series on the History 2 channel on Friday nights and you'll get a taste of their series, you won't be disappointed.",1342742400,,1188,4.2844444444444445
3681915,3,B001L7Y1M4,"I would agree with other reviewers that at the end of the cases nothing is really resolved or 'proof' given.  However, there are some incidents and details of other incidents that I have never heard about - and I look into these matters fairly regularly.  I have done added research on those incidents - they really happened.  The people interviewed are interesting and it is good that most of their identities are revealed.  There are also interviews from well-known witnesses and researchers which are quite good.  This series gives a lot for us to think about.

Now, the not-so-good (or even comical element).  I know that we are living in the 21st century and even documentaries have to keep with the times.  There is a lot of 're-hashing' in the sequences.  I think the typical viewer will be intelligent enough not to have the incident reviewed every three minutes.  In addition, I am not sure why Bill (one of the History Channel investigators) is even there at all.  He serves no real purpose, except to wear a baseball cap that billboards ""UFO MAGAZINE"" in most scenes.  For those of you who haven't seen this series, imagine Johnny Carson's sidekick, Ed McMahon, as being a part of this investigation/series - well, that's Bill.  He has this unnerving habit of repeating others or saying something that others have said that and somehow making it sound likes that's his original idea.  He also has specific scenes that come out of nowhere and asks questions like, 'Was there a UFO here?' (duh).  Bill also wears his sunglasses the majority of the time which I thought was stupid (even when working inside the studio and watching experiments), then I saw a clip when he did not wear the sunglasses.  Now, I prefer him wearing the sunglasses as he has a terrible nervous squint.  Anyway, if you could cut out 80% of the scenes with Bill in it the viewer would still be able to follow the case very easily and would probably be able to squeeze in 1 or 2 more DVDs in the set.  (I'm sure Bill is a nice guy, but he shouldn't be on TV unless directly interviewed about something he has an original thought about).

Don't let this put you off buying this series.  I gave it 3 stars, but if Bill was taken out it would have been an easy solid 4.  It's really good otherwise.",1301702400,2,2277,4.559113300492611

Even though some are based on well-known UFO lore, they manage to thoroughly investigate from a different POV, - from expert eyewitness testimony, scientifically, historically, first hand.

8317572,5,B001L7Y1M4,"Having watched all the episodes of Season 1 and 2, I can tell you that some of it is very good and exposes some really interesting sightings I didn't know about. At first when I watched a few episodes on TV I was not too fond of this show because two of the main characters don't seem too bright. For example, Ted often asks witnesses if they think this was ""A real UFO"". Finally I saw one person answer the way I would: ""It was flying and I can't identify it, so yes, it was a real UFO"". Ted seems to think UFO means a flying saucer from another planet. How could someone who saw a thing in the sky possibly know if it is from another planet ? The government knows because they have the resources to track things in space, but of course they won't tell.",1460073600,,754,4.101351351351352
