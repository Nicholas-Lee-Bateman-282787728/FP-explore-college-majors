3912542,4,B002DQSKO2,"Something has come to the desert to feed and apparently it's digestive system can't process noses.  I don't review movies too often but figured I'd throw one up here since no one else has, if only to let people know what they're getting into with this movie.  It's the usual story here:  group of friends heads out on a road trip across the desert and run into some strange things.  Something in the desert is feeding on travelers.  What?  I can't tell you.  Why not?  Because I watched the whole movie and there is no monster to be seen.  That will probably be the number 1 complaint about this movie.

The entire movie is spent building up suspense and then just when you think the payoff is coming the credits roll.  I'm not complaining though, ok maybe just a little.  The director does a very good job of building tension here.  The actors are all decent and what little special effects are used are functional.  The atmosphere is nice and creepy as well.  Overall, I really liked this movie and will definitely watch it again.

Going to go out on a limb here and say this film is not going to be for everyone.  A lot of people will not like it at all simply because they don't show you the monster.  If you're the type that can deal with that then definitely check this film out.  If you're a gorehound looking for an action-packed creature feature you may want to look elsewhere.",1256774400,22,1386,4.407114624505929
8365916,1,B002DQSKO2,"Terrible film: script, acting, editing, plot, photography. Very amateurish. Seems like it was a student film. Director has no idea how to build suspense (there is none). The overacting is typical of amateur student actors. This must have been a student project. Do yourself a favor, and skip this. You're welcome.",1508630400,,313,5.1568627450980395
8365917,2,B002DQSKO2,"but with ambiguous creatures instead of a witch; and a side of pro-veganism. That pretty much sums up 2006 Feeding Grounds, a micro-budget horror flick about eight bickering youths in Southern California who get stuck in the desert and encounter the unknown.

To get anything good from Feeding Grounds you have to be able to acclimate to its low-budget style and limitations. I did and was able to find some rewarding elements, but its mainly a tedious and one-dimensional barely-a-budget horror flick. Despite the lack of funds, theres some evidence that the filmmakers have talent. Parts of the movie have an eerie, arty ambiance in a good way. So the filmmaking is noticeably better than the do-it-yourself amateur (non)tone of the similar Delirium, which came out just after Feeding Grounds.

There are a couple of things that make the movie worth investing in, like the voluptuous redhead in the opening act, Rachel (Rebecca Gannon). Unfortunately, its just a glorified cameo and you have to endure an eye-rolling lesbian romance sequence to appreciate her. Secondly, and more importantly, theres a notable rock/metal song that plays during the end credits. While the credits list the five or six songs that appear on the soundtrack I was unable to pinpoint which is the one that plays during the final credits. Its obviously a no-name band, but its outstanding; very creative.

The eight youths that make up the cast are diverse and believable in their roles, not spoiled college kids, Just ordinary people, but they're only so-so interesting; and mostly not. If the script was tweaked they might be more compelling. Plus there are no real babes aside from the aforementioned Rachel from the brief prologue. Still, I appreciated the distinctions between the characters and their overall realistic portrayal.

As for the attackers or creatures, it becomes clear that they have a way of initially infecting the victims via some kind of bite or sting (or whatever), which makes them sick, semi-drugged ripe prey. Now and then youll hear a radio broadcast that provides info on what may be happening  unknown disappearances in the desert and the theorizing thereof, which is reminiscent of the occasional TV broadcasts in 1968s renowned Night of the Living Dead.

A few plot holes: Why do the creatures allow the police to come & go without attacking them? Why does one driver refer to the lack of exits on the highway when its a two-lane road, not an interstate? Speaking of the road, why is it paved with people occasionally driving by and then mysteriously morphs into a dirt road and (I think) back again?

The film runs 82 minutes and was shot in Southern California.

8365918,4,B002DQSKO2,"Well, this was a welcome change, a road trip horror movie that doesnt suck.  This one, in fact, was pretty decent.  Written by two of its stars, Alex Ballar and Jamie Gannon, FEEDING GROUNDS is the story of 8 friends, 4 guys, 4 girls, on their way to a cabin owned by one of them, traveling through the desert, who have to stop for a few hours because the cabins not ready yet.  The sister of the girl whose family owns the cabin hasn't vacated yet, so they decide to kill some time on the side of the highway with some sandwiches and pot.

The groups split up into twos as the pairings are established, and much fun as good conversation is had until one of them finds a human ear on the ground.  Everyone freaks out and they pile back into the cars and take off.  They drive for longer than they should have, never seeing an exit or any signs of civilization, until the cars stall and won't start again.

By now the paranoia and aggression has begun to sink in, and the effects of the darts they were unknowingly hit with have started to manifest.  Back when they stopped before, they didn't know they were being watched--by what, we don't know--or that the watchers had drugged them.

Soon everyone is sick, dehydrated, delirious except Mary, the vegan, who claims they're not after her because, they know I won't eat them.  Who are they?  Again, we don't know.  In fact, the only suggestion were given about our groups unseen attackers is what sounds at first like the paranoid ramblings of a man on a radio talk show they're listening to as they drive.  He talks about undiscovered animals lying in wait for hundreds of thousands of years, hidden from humanity.

FEEDING GROUNDS is an interesting addition to the road trip genre.  Theres no escape killer on the loose, no clan of redneck cannibals, nor do the members of the group turn on each other (okay, so theres some in-fighting, but those come as a result of longstanding tension between the characters dating back to long before we meet them).  Theres something out there, for sure, but we don't know what, where, how many, or how theyll attack.  In fact, from what I gathered watching the movie, the drugs they attack with eat you up from the inside, drying you out, making you loopy, then you wander away and throw up.  After that, you're defenseless and they can attack and eat you.

Junior Bonner directs and this is, to date, his only credit in that capacity, although hes got 3 more recent editor credits.  I won't say hes a great director, as I think most of what made this movie so work was the script and the cast, but there were definitely some touches here and there that were stylistic enough they were obvious director choices, and they were good one.  He certainly has a knack for using the camera to heighten tension and cause confusion.  He representation of the paranoia among the characters is also well-done, and he injects a ton of atmosphere into his scenes.

The cast was entirely unknown to me, but from what Ive found in my search, they make a lot of low budget movies together, the men do at least.  The women in the cast don't have a ton of credits, and not a lot of it was anything Id heard of.  For over half a dozen relatively unknowns, they did a pretty good job, I thought.  And their characters were very well-developed, coming across as three dimensional people you might actually know in some area of your life.

I don't have a lot negative to say about FEEDING GROUNDS, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  Then third act had a great deal of tension in it, and the ending was very satisfying.  I don't mind that there was no real explanation for the creatures, I think the point of the movie was more what was happening with the characters and their sense of helplessness.  If we had understood the creatures more, I think it would have lessened that hopeless feeling because once you understand it, you can try to find its weakness and fight back, so in retrospect that was definitely the right choice as it kept that tension level high.

For having bought this movie for, basically, $1.25 (in a 4-pack of other road trip movies for $5), FEEDING GROUNDS was well worth the price, and one I don't mind recommending.  Its not setting any new standards in the road trip from hell genre, but its definitely entertaining and has several original ideas.  This was a welcome change from the usual.",1387497600,,4404,4.506297229219143
8365919,1,B002DQSKO2,"For a movie made in 2010 I have no idea how they got the feel (and wardrobe) of a student film of the late 90s.  It's all pretty bad.  Acting, writing, directing.  I couldn't even get to the action-filled parts of the movie.",1359763200,,224,4.162790697674419
8365920,2,B002DQSKO2,"The film opens up with some promising girl/girl action before the opening credits. We then switch to 4 young couples who stop in the never ending ""Doom Desert"" on their way to a cabin. The couples range from vegans to a pair that drop acid. Nice to know some things haven't changed since the sixties. The movie consists of a lot of talking/kissing between the couples while something that make ""predator"" type noises stalks them.

In this low budget film, you never get to see the creature, just some low budget body parts with bright red blood on them. Heck, we don't even get to see the lizard everyone else sees. There are clues in the conversation about cross species breeding, although nothing is certain.

The acting and dialouge weren't half bad. The horror aspect was so-so as it dragged on without us ever seeing a kill or the creature. Available on a 20 pack horror set from Wal Mart for $10.00.

8365921,3,B002DQSKO2,"As far as low-budget ""road trip to hell"" movies go, I would rate Feeding Grounds just slightly above average.  It follows the stereotypical storyline we've all seen about a thousand times by now, but it manages to avoid any ridiculous moments, features some pretty good special effects and decent acting, and wraps the whole thing up with a fairly effective little ending.  This is not to say that everyone is going to like this movie, though - especially given the fact that the ""monster"" is never really seen (although we get plenty of POV shots from his perspective and see a little bit of his handiwork).

So, basically, these four guys hook up with these four girls and head off across the desert to some cabin somewhere, fully expecting a good time to be had by all (well, three of the couples, anyway).  As they pass a crudely made sign marking the beginning of ""Doom Desert,"" we already know what awaits them - and it's not a good time.  Since they have some time to kill, they decide to pull over and have a little desert picnic (apparently, this isn't a very hot desert).  Tomfoolery and an escalation in tension between the guys ensues - until one of them makes a small but gruesome discovery.  Deciding it's time to leave, they all rush back to their cars and burn some rubber.  For various reasons, though, they end up pulling over several more times further down the road.  Some unidentified sickness begins taking a heavy toll on them one by one, even as they are taunted by signs of some kind of avian monster.

Don't expect a lot of blood and gore here (puke yes, but blood and gore no), as this film is more about the suspense and tension of these characters trying to deal with their deteriorating physical and mental states - the monster is always out there, lurking on the fringes, but he never actually pops up and says Boo!  That puts the full weight of the movie on the shoulders of the actors and actresses (and the scriptwriter), and I think these young people pull things off pretty well for a low-budget movie of this type.  Their bickering and emotional reactions to fear and stress may get on your nerves eventually, but not to the point where you'll be exhorting the monster to hurry up and kill any or all of them.  Unfortunately, the film never really succeeds at invoking a palpable sense of dread or suspense (but that can be said of most movies in this particular genre).  What did impress me was the ending.  The filmmakers keep it simple and avoid any attempt at a lame ""twist,"" and they also manage to bring an obscure plot point full circle in the process.  It all adds up to a slightly better than average little horror film.",1306195200,2,2666,4.522916666666666
8365922,2,B002DQSKO2,"Feeding Grounds is one of those horror flicks in which the DVD cover is more interesting than the movie itself.  While the story itself had some potential, it will only leave you disappointed in the end.

Feeding Grounds is the story of eight road trippers who make a stop in the desert on the way to a remote cabin for a fun weekend.  One by one, they are picked off by a mysterious creature that feeds on unsuspecting travelers.  To make matters worse, they become infected with an illness that makes them irritable and distrustful of one another.

Normally I would start a film review with praise for a movie's strong points, but unfortunately there aren't any.  While most of the cast has some film experience, none of the performances stand out.  While I cut director Junior Bonner some slack for this being his first film, the directing and cinematography don't stand out.  The color correction is poor, and the film simply looks low-budget from start to finish.

One of the most irritating aspects of the film is that it's filled with plot holes.  You never find out exactly what makes the victims become ill, or why the creature intentionally doesn't eat specific body parts.  The story becomes downright painful when one of the women knowingly suggests that the creatures don't want her because they can sense that she's a vegan.

The most frustrating thing of all is that we never even get to see what's hunting down the victims.  We can either chalk this up to a budget too low to create a costume, or the writer's idea to create tension by not revealing the creature.  So what you're left with is 81 minutes of strange sounds, and a single shot of what we can only assume is the creature's clawed hand.

One of the only redeeming features of the film is that it starred gorgeous Native American actress Candise Lakota.  Aside from that, this was your typical low-budget flick that failed to deliver.  This would hardly be worth a $1.00 Redbox rental, let alone a $1.99 instant play through Amazon.  My suggestion is that you pass on this one.",1297555200,,2054,4.642659279778393
8365923,4,B002DQSKO2,"Feeding Grounds is one of the more interesting films in the horror genre.  No, you don't exactly see any intense or violent images on screen, nor is there a particular moment that truly stands out as gruesome or shocking.  The film is more about building suspense and guessing just what *is* the monster supposed to be.

I was sitting there on the couch guessing just what that constant, terrifying growling sound being released deep in the darkness of the desert was supposed to indicate.  I guess it's up to speculation just what was causing terror and chaos to the teenagers (actually more like young adults if you ask me).  Me?  I was guessing everything from werewolves to whatever kind of vivid imagination the writers were going for when creating Feeding Grounds.

My only complaint is that it took around 45 minutes to actually GET somewhere.  During the first 45 minutes, you're basically forced to put up with teenagers doing nothing even remotely interesting- just acting like typical, drugged up, arrogant teenagers trying to hit on the closest girl around and sharing personal stories about themselves.  More time and energy *should* have been devoted to the great atmosphere that only ended up being about 30 minutes of film, which was unfortunate.

Still, if you can find a way to sit through a bunch of nonsense that doesn't really translate to any kind of compelling storytelling, by all means, the final 30 minutes is definitely what I consider quality horror atmosphere.  Those growls were definitely edge of your seat suspense.",1294358400,4,1547,4.957364341085271
8365924,2,B002DQSKO2,"I'll keep this brief, as this film already wasted 90 minutes of my life. Let's start with the positives, however. First, the video and editing equipment used for this were top notch (esp during the night scenes which a quite well lit - unlike so many videos of this kind, and the camerawork was decent. Several of the actors were actually decent, a step (barely) above the usual shot-on-video-no-budget C-horror movie. It is the script which kills this one. The dialog is ridiculous, as though they didn't bother with read-throughs and simply chose to recite the lines verbatim, regardless of how awkward and stilted the interactions between characters. Nothing can save this from the tedious and boring production that it is. You won't care one bit about the characters in the opening (when any film should be drawing in the viewer, setting the tone for the rest of the film) and you'll care even less as this one rolls on ponderously to its welcomed conclusion. That is a shame, as some of the actors here obviously have talent. Just amazing to me that so many pieces on this one were in place, but the dialog, plot, and storytelling were just abysmal. Avoid this one, as I really have nothing reasonable to recommend that would warrant my suggesting you rent it. If you like C-movie horror, this one will still disappoint - despite the usual investment in the DVD's cover artwork, which will undoubtedly cause some folks to give it a try (like myself). Trust me, do NOT judge this book by its cover.",1273190400,2,1502,4.714828897338403
8365925,1,B002DQSKO2,"Feeding Grounds is a minimalist bad movie.  The focus of the movie is on how well young people can get along with each other while in party mode rather than on the danger in the background.  The movie appears to be filmed with a video camera, and the slightest monster indications appear to be standard rubber Halloween costume type material.  The black makeup on the girls' faces is supposed to make them look real scary as a sign the danger is approaching but instead just makes them look silly.  One guy wants to bash in a car window over nothing and then runs off into the desert alone as the danger approaches; a girl wants to stay in a stranded car as the night and the danger approach; it's all very ridiculous and not worth the money.

I like to appreciate the various elements in movies regardless of budget size.  I appreciate lower-budget movies like The Dark, Future Force, and Mark Of The Beast, because the specific elements and the overall effort combine to produce movies that are interesting to watch, even though I've seen negative reviews of those movies.

Unfortunately movies such as Feeding Grounds represent a minimalist trend that needs to be reversed.",1258070400,3,1176,4.7073170731707314
