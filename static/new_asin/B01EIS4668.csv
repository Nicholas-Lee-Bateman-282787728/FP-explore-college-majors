7735780,5,B01EIS4668,This series is far the best and we are very unhappy that it has been cancelled.  In this case rage British writers are making a big mistake.  This was the greatest.  As good as Midsomer Murders.,1491868800,2,194,4.333333333333333
7735781,5,B01EIS4668,"The last three years have taken a dreadful toll on my favorite British policemen:
-- ""Foyle's War"" ended in 2015 after eight seasons.
-- ""New Tricks"" ended in 2015 after twelve seasons.
-- ""Inspector Lewis"" ended in 2016 after nine seasons.
-- ""DCI Banks"" ends in 2017 after five seasons.
-- ""George Gently"" will end in 2017 after eight seasons.

We may come to look back on the last ten years as the Golden Age of British Police on Television.
Christopher Foyle, Robbie Lewis and George Gently are better known to us Americans than Alan Banks or the eccentric geezers from ""New Tricks"".
Inspectors Foyle, Lewis and Gently all received national exposure on Masterpiece Mystery.
But my local PBS station (Univ. of Illinois) never broadcast ""DCI Banks"" or ""New Tricks"".
I found them at the library and took a chance.

DCI BANKS:
This excellent and gritty British police series debuted in 2010.
Set in the industrial North of England.
Filmed in and around the city of Leeds in Yorkshire.
My apologies to the Chamber of Commerce, but this is really dreary real estate.
Not a tourist attraction like the Sussex of ""Foyle's War"" or the Thames Valley of ""Inspector Lewis"".

Since the series began, Stephen Tompkinson has played Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, and Andrea Lowe has played Detective Sergeant Annie Cabbot.
There is a surprising amount of sexual tension on this show.
D.S. Cabbot took maternity leave at the start of Season Two.
Nobody knows who the father is, and there is a great deal of speculation among her fellow officers.
[No, DCI Banks is not the father.]

In Season Two, Caroline Catz, as Detective Inspector Helen Morton, was brought in as a temporary replacement.
I have a major crush on this woman
(DCI Banks was filmed simultaneously with ""Doc Martin"").
D.S. Cabbot came back as a single mother for Season Three, but D.I. Helen Morton has caught on and is now part of the team.
All three are back for Season Five.

My major problem with the show is that there was entirely too much fraternization between the ranks, especially in Season Three.
Too much ""Boinking""
Too much ""Rogering""
Too much ""Shagging""
Too much ""Taking Old One-Eye to the Optometrist""
--- British euphemisms for sexual intercourse (from the Online Slang Dictionary)

The implied sexual tension of Seasons One and Two is out in the open.
I would have thought the lower ranks were off-limits to Detective Chief Inspectors.
In my thirty years of experience with the British Police (a lot of TV watching),
this sort of thing never turns out well.*

Surprise: When Season Four opened, the romance between DCI Banks and DS Annie Cabbot has fizzled.
Sergeant Cabbot has gone back to her old boyfriend.
Complication: D.I. Helen Morton's husband has just announced that he wants a divorce.
Most of Season Four was spent with DCI Banks mooning about for his lost love.
But there was a surprising turn of events in the final episode.
Season Five will be interesting.

* Why fraternization between the ranks never works out well:

-- 2013: ""The Fall"" Season One, Episode One
Police Superintendent Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) visits a crime scene,
where she notices handsome Sergeant James Olson.
Without waiting for an introduction, she hands Sergeant Olson her hotel room key,
and orders him to report for duty that night.
No consequences for Superintendent Gibson.
Grave consequences for Sergeant Olson.
I used to think I was fairly liberal about such things, but just realized that I am a prude.
Thanks a lot, Scully.

-- 1992: ""Prime Suspect"" Season Two, Episode One
Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren) seduces Sergeant Bob Oswald.
By the end of the series,
DCI Tennison is fast-tracked for promotion to Superintendent.
Sergeant Oswald is out of a job (he's still better off than Sergeant Olson).

It remains to be seen how the romance between DCI Banks and Sergeant Cabbott will turn out.
I won't give it away - you'll have to watch Season Five.
Although I did warn you that this sort of thing never turns out well.
English SDH subtitles.
Full-length UK versions.
My only real complaint is the lack of Blu-Ray.

7735806,5,B01EIS4668,"I'm sorry to say that I was surprised but glad that the Annie character is no longer a love interest for DCI Banks. The crime stories in these episodes are excellent, but I found the love longed Banks annoying with his relationship with Annie, appearing like a love sick teenager that, in my opinion, detracted from the overall stories. Hopefully, Banks will act more like the DCI he's suppose to be and lead his team while solving these excellent challenging crimes.",1509408000,4,467,4.777777777777778

7735809,2,B01EIS4668,"Spoiler alert!

Okay, so THE MOMENT Katie and Balls admit their love for each other, I casually remarked off-the-cuff that she was a dead woman.  Well, who knew?!  WTH?!  You killed off the best character of the show!  Dumb thing to do.  You thought we watched this to identify with Banks?

Redeem yourself and make an episode where Banks wakes up from a coma, having been injuring *saving* Katie, where the other episodes were his delirium.  Or, renegotiate her contract so you can do the above.

It was SO awfully predictable, and he so awfully impotent (was that the feeling you want us to identify with?) that ""tiresome"" is a polite description of an otherwise entertaining, amusing and energizing show.  Tragedy of errors.",1508025600,3,727,4.837398373983739

7735842,5,B01EIS4668,"Banks has always been a gritty, intense, & probably realistic British cop procedural - what I like most about it is that all the characters have very visible flaws & clear favorites among their professional colleagues.  In spite of those impediments to teamwork, they do form a team that is effective and interesting - due, in large part, to how different they are from each other.  Without giving everything away, one of Banks' coppers doesn't last through the end of the season.  I saw it coming, but was still emotionally torn by the storyline and Bank's reaction to the loss of one of his team rang true to me.  This was probably the best season & I understand this is the last of DCI Banks - I'm sorry there won't be more.",1504915200,4,727,4.484848484848484

7735846,4,B01EIS4668,"Another well done British series full of believable, likable, hate-able, annoying characters with better than average story lines. Great actors, too.
I would have given it 5 stars, except for one character: Annie Cabbot. She was, from the very first scene, aggressive, annoying, bitchy, defensive, selfish, disobedient, manipulative and cold-blooded.
I couldn't believe Banks was attracted to her. I never bought into their relationship. I did not give a toss when she was killed while--yet again -- disobeying Banks' order to stay clear of the bad guy's wife. And who would leave a restaurant in the pouring rain, cross the street and go down an alley to make a call? Really bad writing for that death scene. But, aside from that character and her ridiculous death scene, I'd love to see the show continue for a few more seasons.",1503705600,,830,4.9784172661870505

When we discovered Midsomer Murders we enjoyed the stories and the scenery and tried more BBC series.  While interesting, DCI Banks is almost as brutal as its US counterparts.  Understandably, crime and detective stories have to show some of the underside of life, but I watch these for entertainment, so this was not my cup of tea. Also, I don't miss the character of Annie Cabbot since the convoluted relationship between her and Banks was distracting and the stories would have stood on their own merit without this sideshow.",1502668800,6,656,5.0
7735849,5,B01EIS4668,Hubby is a huge DCI banks series.  We loved the main character when he was on Ballykessal (spelling?) and Mr Tompkins is great if this series too!  Also we like Caroline Katz from Doc Martin series so adding her in this was a nice touch for us!,1501632000,,244,4.170212765957447

I thought the first two or three seasons were okay despite what I felt was the miscasting of Stephen Tompkinson in the Banks role.  But I have grown tired of his overacting, which has increased with each passing season.  Because of this and the several far-fetched plot developments in Season 5, I cannot recommend it, especially to anyone who is a fan of the books.",1497830400,3,473,4.476744186046512
