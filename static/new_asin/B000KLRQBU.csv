8158055,5,B000KLRQBU,"I have owned the 1984 VHS tape version for many years.  My HD TV will play two inputs simultaneously on the screen with both pictures exactly the same size.  So I played the DVD against the VHS and both perfectly synchronized with each other so that I could make a comparison between the two.

The DVD video quality is 50% better than the VHS.  And the DVD played in surround sound which the VHS tape did not.

The classical music and flying is totally mind boggling.  The $20 for me to upgrade to the DVD was easily worth it.

Be aware that this video quality is not up to current standards, but this not significant when compared against the total ambiance of the presentation.",1284681600,,679,4.42741935483871
8158056,5,B000KLRQBU,"The actual filming took place in the 1980's which made it possible for the photography team to film from a much closer view due to a change in the laws of planes and proximity.  While the colors are not ""in your face"" vivid, it is a breathtaking piece of work.  Since there is no narrative, refer to the enclosed map to chalk out the tour trail either before or after you see it.

The viewer gets his money worth on this tour of almost 2 hours of very relaxing and beautiful scenes.  It would take many physical trips (hiking, fly-overs, etc.) to see what is included in this DVD.",1245801600,,580,4.293577981651376
8158057,5,B000KLRQBU,"This is a great DVD, I've been to the Grand Canyon many times, this DVD shows it just as it really is in all it's glory! If you've never been the Grand Canyon to see the real thing I suggest you purchase this DVD, you won't be disappointed!
Enjoy!!",1207353600,,248,4.081632653061225
8158058,5,B000KLRQBU,"I spent a most enjoyable, calm, peaceful two hrs.
viewing this video.  Not only worth watching but the
music is worth hearing.  In the early 1960's my
husband (now deceased) and I, drove our V.W. for a two
week vacation through that part of the west.  We ""saw""
the Painted Desert and Grand Canyon.  We both loved
the west and all our vacations were in that direction.
 Naturally, the canyon we saw was from the tourist
views along the south rim.  (We did walk down in to
the canyon a sort distance to see Indian drawings on
the walls.)  This video is proof of what I always felt
- what a beautiful country I live in.  Please forgive
my over exuberance, but I just want to say how
much I have enjoyed this video and will continue
to enjoy it over and over.",1187827200,,755,4.230769230769231
8158059,1,B000KLRQBU,"The video quality is not clear and after 5 minutes the content seems repeatative and rather boring. Seems like a home movie from a chartered helicopter. Music is nice but there is little variety to maintain the viewer's and listener's interest. If the video quality were good, it would make a pleasing musical method to document this spectacular scenery. Found it quite disappointing.",1181174400,2,384,5.111111111111111
8158060,5,B000KLRQBU,"Wow! Having never been able to visit the Grand Canyon in person, this video is a real treat.  It is a very relaxing experience and is not cluttered with narration or technical details. It has a great classical soundtrack and the views are magnificent!  Highly recommended.",1170892800,,272,4.891304347826087
