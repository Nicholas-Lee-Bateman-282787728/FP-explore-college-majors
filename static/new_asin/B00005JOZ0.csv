1544513,5,B00005JOZ0,"This movie really took me by surprise. I am sooo happy I took a chance on watching it. The message was nothing less than inspiring, funny, educational, and loving. I am going to buy the DVD plus the soundtrack. The theme song, ""African Queen"" is truly a beautiful song. Everyone needs to see this movie, especially young girlz experiencing problems with their body image.  Many big thanks to Nnegest Likke, Monique, and Jimmy Jean-Louis, for a job well done.",1159228800,3,458,4.7974683544303796
1544514,3,B00005JOZ0,"This movie is corny and inconsistent, but that's what makes it funny (my favorite scene was when Jasmine was at the burger joint). Jasmine was too emotional and overreacted at times, almost to the point of becoming aggressive. Since she had boxing gloves at home, you would've thought she'd take some type of kickboxing class to help her release frustration and lose the weight at the same time. Anyway, the message being reiterated throughout the movie is for big girls to love their bodies, have more confidence, and go for their dreams. That's a good message (for any woman), but being overweight is still a health issue (diabetes, difficulty walking, asthma, HBP, etc.). Nothing funny about that.",1159228800,3,700,4.9914529914529915
1544515,4,B00005JOZ0,"It was really nice to finally see a movie where the lead actress was not a size 2.  What a refreshing change this was and I only wish it had been a bigger box office success so more people had a chance to see it and learn the message in here.

Monique wasn't as funny in here as she was in The Parkers, but she was very good.  She plays Jazmin who thinks love is out of her reach because of her size and that it is also holding her back from achieving success in her professional life.  She want's to start a clothing line for full figured women.  She works in Bloomfields where she is constantly discouraged at all the thin girls and the lack of clothing for larger women.  She wins a competition to spend a weekend at a Palms Springs resort with her best friend and cousin and while there, she meets Dr Tunde who is over from Nigeria on business.  He is captivated by her (in Nigeria they say that the bigger the woman, the richer and more beautiful she is).  Because she doesn't yet love herself the way he begins to, she thinks he isn't genuine and believes he lied to her about his whereabouts one night.  On her return to LA, things take a different turn after she gets out of the funk she was in and she starts realising her dream of becoming a designer.  Without spoiling the end, there is a message in here that you must love yourself before anyone else can love you.  On the only negative note, I have to say that while she wants to be loved for who she is, she want's a fine guy and not a nerdy overweight guy herself.

This movie didn't make me laugh out loud on a regular basis, although there are funny moments scattered throught the movie, but it's enjoyable for the mere fact that there wasn't any anorexic actress in here.  I really hope this is a movie that mothers of young girls will make watch because there is something for them to learn from it.  I really liked it and hope everyone else will too.",1158969600,,1920,4.2103825136612025
1544516,3,B00005JOZ0,"Mo'nique plays Jazmin Biltmore a hefty woman who thinks her shape is what's preventing her from finding a meaningful relationship. She's been on all kinds of diets and is currently taking Metabo Pills in her efforts to lose weight. Jazmin works in a department store whose plus-size section is severely lacking and she begins making her own clothes because stores don't carry anything attractive in her size.  Her end goal is to show her designs to the head buyer of her store and launch her own clothing line. When she gets shot down for a loan to create her own clothing line, she gets lifted back up by winning a Metabo Pill vacation to a five-star resort with her best friends. There she meets a Nigerian doctor who has no problems with her size, but does have a problem with her self-worth.

Overall, Jazmin's story was relatively uplifting though at times it moved too quickly. The end of the movie looked like it was just thrown together and too many plot points were resolved at the last minute. Also, the film quality is pretty poor and at times it looked like this movie was shot with someone's home video camera.

Though I found this film fun and amusing, it's definitely borderline R-rating. I wouldn't watch this movie with kids because it has all of the vulgarity and profanity that anyone who knows Mo'nique's work would expect. I thought it was funny, but anyone who wanted something cute to watch with their kids would be in for a rude awakening despite the PG-13 rating.  If you liked Coming to America and the Queens of Comedy, I think you'll enjoy this one too.",1158537600,2,1581,4.615658362989324
1544517,2,B00005JOZ0,At times this movie was funny. But the plot was all over the place and there were parts that were so corny I was like come on. I felt the main character felt too sorry for herself and was mean and spiteful to some of the other characters. Anyway black men like fuller figures so I didn't understand why she felt it so hard that this gorgeous doctor was in love with her. But overall the movie did have a very postive message.,1158537600,2,425,4.132530120481928
1544518,3,B00005JOZ0,"While it's not nearly as bad as the IMDb rating would suggest (1,9/10 as of this writing), ""Phat Girlz"" is a very uneven movie. At times it's cute, but the screenplay should have been rewritten and the plot tightened up; the pace slows down too much at times, especially in the middle of the movie.

The main character, Jazmin, is at times too rude to get the viewer's sympathies. She doesn't like being picked judged by the way she looks, but she tends to be equally shallow when judging others. Mo'Nique gives all she's got, and her fans will enjoy her performance. The rest of the cast is not very good with the exceptions of Jack Noseworthy and Eric Roberts's cameo.

Overall, ""Phat Girlz"" is a slightly-below-average comedy which is likely to appeal mostly to people who sometimes feel bad about being overweight.",1157328000,3,818,4.713286713286713
1544519,4,B00005JOZ0,"This is a very positive and uplifting movie.....and funny too! If you had second thoughts about seeing in the the theater - this is  your chance to see it. You won't be disappointed.

If you have an adversion to fat or to people who DO NOT wear a size double 00, then this is NOT your kind of movie.

1544520,5,B00005JOZ0,"I shared this movie with my tiny daughter and a group of friends.  I was seeking a message of acceptance but got much much more.  It is a great dramatic comedy with a great message, a lesson in culture and a romance.  It is a good movie for women in search of acceptance (all of us) and for those who put others down because of their differences (all of us).",1156204800,12,358,4.085714285714285
1544521,4,B00005JOZ0,"I have to be honest when I first heard of this movie. My first thought was another bad movie like the Cookout. To my pleasant surprise It was really good. It has a positive message which will appeal to anyone. Monique plays a salesperson trying create a clothing line for plus-size women while battling the prejudice that she meets from others as well as accepting who she is. A movie about self-esteem,self-improvement, self-awareness. I would recommended this to anyone.",1145318400,24,472,4.987341772151899

1544689,5,B00005JOZ0,"Within the withering spotlight as no other film has ever been before, Nnegest Likks ""Phat Girlz"" had is world premire April 7, 2006, until last night Id never experienced it. And now that the wraps are off, the mystery has been exposed and Ms. Likkes and the RKO directors have taken the much-debated leap, it can be safely stated that suppression of this film would have been a crime. For, in spite of some disconcerting lapses and strange ambiguities in the creation of the principal character, ""Phat Girlz"" is far and away the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture to be seen here in many a moon. As a matter of fact, it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood.
Count on Ms. Likkes; she doesn't do things by halves. Being a mercurial fellow, with a frightening theatrical flair, she moved right into the movies, grabbed the medium by the ears and began to toss it around with the dexterity of a seasoned veteran. Fact is, she handled it with more verve and inspired ingenuity than any of her elder craftsmen have exhibited in years. Upon the screen she discovered an area large enough for her expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence is that she has made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts.
As for the story which he tellsand which has provoked such an uncommon fussthis corner frankly holds considerable reservation. Naturally we wouldn't know how closelyif at allit parallels the life of a Two plus-sized ladies who meet the men of their dreams in the most unexpected of ways.
Over the course of the film we see two large women, one a tart-tongued gal (Mo'Nique) who wants to be a fashion designer, struggle to find love and acceptance in a culture where thin is in. Their lives take a dramatic turn when they meet the men of their dreams in ways that are completely unexpected. ***SPOILER The Phat Girlz are thrown a major curve ball when the men of their dreams who come from a culture where big is better.
We would, indeed, like to say as many nice things as possible about everything else in this filmabout the excellent direction, about the sure and penetrating performances of literally every member of the cast and about a stunning manner. Space, unfortunately, is short. All we can say, in conclusion, is that you shouldn't miss this film. It is cynical, ironic, sometimes oppressive and as realistic as a slap. But it has more vitality than fifteen other films we could name. And fun fact, the food facility used to film the FatAssBurger scene was the Fatburger in Palm Springs, California.",1471478400,2,2661,4.71244635193133

1544747,4,B00005JOZ0,"This movie is amazing. Not only do they touch on serious topics such as African-American women self hatred and full figured women self-hatred, they also implied that individuals can reach a point in their lives when they are mature enough and experienced enough to deal with the reality that they are not perfect, and no matter how much society tries to convince you if we just changed this or that about our outtet we can reach that level of perfection. All that we all know there is no such thing as perfection and, that's okay. That's the world, especially Western culture, placing unrealistic expectations on us all. I think there should be more movies like this, that not only show the harsh reality that we live in, in a comical way, a film such as Phat Girlz also suggest a solution and that's a few of the things that I really appreciated about this movie.",1466380800,2,864,4.580645161290323

It gave good insight into how big girls feel about being overweight & how they're frustrated with the options they have for clothing; such as frumpy options rather than trendy, flattering options. Great part of the story line is Mo'Nique's character works in a clothing store & she has great ideas for trendy, fashionable clothing for big girls & it's her dream to be able to have her designs in a store. She also designs & makes her own clothes in this movie & she looks fabulous in her outfits, esp. that ""yellow dress.""  Did a good job with Mo'Nique's love interest by making him be this tall, dark, fine, good-looking man from Nigeria where the men love big women. They also added the skinny cousin that gave great laughs because she thought she was ""All That"" since she rcvd a lot of attn. from men in America then when she met the men & women from Nigeria they thought she was sickly since she was so thin.",1456704000,,1008,4.390374331550802

I thought the movie would be a silly and trite ghetto story by the way it was advertised, but it had more substance than most movies out there today. On the surface it is a fat girl's Cinderella tale, but it delves into much deeper themes such as self-love and self acceptance, what true love is and isn't and learning how to just be comfortable in your own skin. I think our society could really use that message. 2 THUMBS AND 8 FINGERS UP for this movie!!!",1354665600,,632,4.552631578947368

1545407,2,B00005JOZ0,"Mo'Nique is Jasmin Biltmore (ha ha, get it), an inspiring fashion designer who is disheartened that she's in a world where skinny women are ironically living large.  She tried to use diet pills, but she kept eating food and getting into verbal assaults.  But suddenly, the bitter, disgrunted woman had a chance of a lifetime.  She just happened to win a five-day resort with her friends, so they travel in style.  From there, she just happened to find an attractive Nigerian doctor, who found her alluring because he just happens to be into hefty women.  At one point, these two and their friends go to a Nigerian feast where people who gobble up food is a compliment.  And they all live happily ever after.

Let me understand the message in ""Phat Girlz"": if you're a fat woman, hope that you win a lavishing location so you can find a man of your dreams who's in chubby, and if you want to be with him, you have to eat lots of food.  That is messed up.  Okay, that's not really the case in this movie, Jasmin has to believe in her inner beauty, be confident, follow her dreams and such, but the first-half is certainly manipulated to be that way.  I don't like how it's set up by chance, not by how Jamzin initiated herself to eventually find her dream man, so it was rather phony.  I also don't like how the film was shot, how the flashbacks were done on the cheap, and how goofy and mean the jokes are, like the burger joint scene.  The movie's heart is in the right place, but it's poorly told. Not to mention this is quite a morbid fantasy.

It's not a good movie, but to be fair, ""Phat Girlz"" does have one merit worth mentioning. It occured in a scene when Mo'Nique when through a midlife crisis after leaving the resort, and she was sobbing like crazy and then trashed her own room out of metamorphosis (preceed by a TV showing some fat lady verbally degrading herself).  That was so depressing, almost unnecessarily so given the previous scene a while ago where Jazmin goes to a fast-food place called 'fatass burger'; it's like Johnny 5's tragic moment in ""Short Circuit 2"" or Adam Sandler's last moments in ""Click"", having one downer moment in an otherwise obnoxious wacky comedy. She really went out at that point, and in my personal opinion, her one burst of hysteria might be more shocking that her entire performance in ""Precious"".  That's probably because I was surprised.

Also, that Kendra C. Johnson actress doesn't look bad for a woman of her stature.",1279238400,,2471,4.531531531531532
1545408,5,B00005JOZ0,"This is what I call ""substance comedy"". It was a very surprsing enjoyable comedy with something to say: ""joy comes from within"" and ""it's not what you are, but who you are"". MoNique is just fantastic, and we identify with her as she struggles to find her own self-identity, and cheer her triumph of the human spirit. Both my wife and I laughed a lot, especially in Fat Ass Burger scene that had just the funniest lines. I've seen that scene three times already. It's a classic. To the full bodied or skinney, this is a movie for all people who may feel incomplete, and plays on the theme that we make our lives what it is with our attitude, and when we have the right attitude, the breaks we need come. Maybe not to all of us, but this is a feel good fanatsy, so why not just start believing. When you see this film, you will understand why the great Mo'Nique was cast in ""Precious"" that won her a well deserved Oscar. Indeed, she's a prodigious talent. It's a darn shame that this movie only grossed over seven million dollars in its domestic theatrical release. Guess it was poor marketing.",1268956800,,1092,4.410891089108911
1545409,1,B00005JOZ0,This is the worst movie I've watched in a long time!  The acting was awful and the plot was very lame.  I'm not usually this harsh but this was really bad.,1268179200,,155,3.967741935483871

1545411,4,B00005JOZ0,This movie is funny and worth the purchase.  If you are feeling bad about your size and need a pick me up buy this movie.,1257292800,,121,3.84
1545412,2,B00005JOZ0,"I like Mo'Nique and I really wanted to like this film but it falls flat for me. The concept is decent but the execution is a clumsy one to say the least.

Phat Girlz is about Jazmin(Mo'Nique), a plus sized woman who dreams of owning her own clothing line for plus-sized women. Jazmin, her friend Stacey(Kendra C. Johnson) and her cousin Mia(Joyful Drake) go on a trip. Both Jazmin and Stacey end up meeting the men of their dreams.

What I like about the movie: The concept is a decent one. I like the message of the movie about loving yourself no matter your size and weight. I also like the fact that the movie has the ladies hooking up with African men which I find admirable since we hold someone else's standards of beauty in high regard for far too long. Plus it has a few funny moments hence the two stars.

What I dislike about the movie: Where do I start? The humor is forced and sometimes the jokes could be spotted 2 miles away. The scene at the burger restaurant where she breaks out into the dozens with the smarmy employee has to be one of the cheesiest scenes in movie history. She was using your mama jokes that I was using back in 1991 when I was in middle school. The messages the movie sends is not bad but the way it sends these messages are flat out corny. Case in point: Jazmin is sassed by a couple of women in a club. She tells them that their insulting her weight because they hate themselves which is true. But she tells them in a Hallmark/Lifetime channel type of way that makes the message hard to take serious. You can convey comments like that without sounding like a person that spent way too much time watching Full House. Everything else that happens after wards is just cheesy including the ending where Jazmin breaks the fourth wall to tell us that we would have to order the sex tape between her and her man.

In short Phat Girlz isn't a bad movie but it isn't a good one either. Under better direction and better writing it could have been good. But instead we get a movie that falls short its potential due to a stale script that phones in everything from the humor to the storyline itself. Two stars and nothing higher.",1242777600,,2158,4.334158415841584
1545413,5,B00005JOZ0,Monique and Jimmy Jean-Louis do an outstanding job together and actually the whole cast was phenomenal!  I hope more comedies come out as good as this one!!!,1240444800,,157,4.814814814814815
1545414,4,B00005JOZ0,"I think this film is funny, but I must say a little bit unreal. It is like she wants to make every girl fat? that is not even healthy! but I do believe we all are beautiful and it doesnt matter if you're fat or skinny how you feel is what you will reflect.",1231632000,,256,3.759259259259259
1545455,3,B00005JOZ0,"Phat Girlz is a hard film to hate because it comes from a genuinely real and unique perspective.  It is also a great task to defend for being of such poor production quality and having jokes that miss more often than not.  My wife informed me that she would no longer read my reviews if I didn't take her suggestion to see Phat Girlz and review it seriously.  I initially did not want to sit through it but upon further consideration my wife sat through my silent horror movie phase, so I owed her one.  Film is one of the few things we don't share the same level of appreciation for.  Besides, I've always taken some pride in watching and reviewing a share of notoriously bad films.

Anyway, Phat Girlz is produced and directed by virtual unknowns and it sort of shows.  That's actually being very kind.  The film is primarily a vehicle for actress/comedian Mo'Nique Imes, better known as just Mo'Nique. I have no doubt that she influenced this film in every way creatively, for better or worse.  She plays the film's protagonist Jazmin, an overweight would-be fashion designer whose awkward attitude about her own weight and resentment to those around her (particularly skinny girls), make for an interesting viewpoint although it does wear out its welcome by the film's conclusion.

The internet movie database indicates this film as among its bottom 100.  I don't think that's a fair assessment but the film is definitely not very good.  I hardly think the morality behind Mo'Nique's film was taken into the same consideration by the mobocracy on that site as it is here.  Again, I'm rating this down based primarily on the production quality and the fact that the jokes don't work as often as intended.  The film gains two stars because it means well and has a different voice.",1228262400,,1782,4.7064516129032254

I find Mo'nique a very good actress and she delivers her lines with comic timing.  I found her character very believeable but also I think she as a woman would be a great friend to have in your life.",1210118400,,329,4.125
1545458,4,B00005JOZ0,"In the large clothing chain where Jazmin Biltmore works the embarrassing plus size section is hidden in a corner of the store. Jazmin and her co-workers avoid it like the plague for fear of having to sell something from it to a customer. Plus size Jazmin makes her own clothing and always looks ""Fat-tabulous!"" Her dream is having her own clothing line in production and on the curves of other thick women; unfortunately, she can't get to the head buyer of her company and the bank won't give her a loan.

Just when she thinks she can't get any more depressed she wins an all expense paid trip to a five star resort in Palm Springs. Jazmin and her best friend, who is also thick, quickly learn that Palm Springs is the stomping ground for the rich skinny butts. Well, not everything... while hanging out by the poolside the three ladies are approached by a visiting doctor named Tunde from Nigeria. Tunde is instantly smitten with Jazmin, much to everyone else's surprise. The ladies are invited to a Nigerian dinner conference where they learn that there are indeed men in the world who know how to treat a lady with curves.

Unfortunately, Jazmin isn't used to all this positive energy and can't see the genuine affection. Her own insecurities cause her to self-destruct and she ends up sabotaging her relationship with Tunde, fleeing home to wallow and binge for three days on a bed buffet of junk food. She finally realizes she will never be a size 5 and that she has to start living now. With her new skin of determination she finds the nerve to approach the head buyer and sell her self. Next thing she knows, she's an international success in plus size clothing design in charge of a hot new line of clothing affectionately called ""Thick Madame"" in Tunde's honor. But she still has one major regret she needs to take care of.

Phat Girlz is a comedy for sure but there are surprising emotional scenes when Mo'Nique breaks down that I never expected from this comedian. The main theme of this film is the power of kindness and respect. A positive kudos for this film is that Jazmin didn't have to lose weight to find her bliss. A number of great songs including Brick House, So Luscious, and African Queen (I love that song!) keep the movie charged. The film pokes fun at a few stereotypes like the junk food buffet bed mentioned above and again when Jazmin and her friend OVER order at the fast food restaurant but they are bearable.

I was resistant to watch Phat Girlz because I have never been a huge Mo'Nique fan despite her fat acceptance popularity but I'm glad I did. Fat chics need more films that highlight their lives and are not all about changing the number on the scale to find happiness and success. It's really a feel good movie. Reviewed by M.E.

This is Phat Girls! Love Yourself, Your Big Booty, Your Delicious Double Mints, it is you, so why spend time hating it!?!

Please if you have any doubts of the above statements, rent Phat Girls.

When I saw this movies title I was skeptical, but eager to check it out right away. I had to wonder what angle this movie would take. It certainly was not what I expected, but it was Fab-U-lous-sious!

Any woman who has been made to feel less than will appreciate this movie.

It may open some peoples eyes as well. It is commonly known that fat women appeal to attractive and successful men worldwide. Some just havn't figured that out yet! Skinny or fat we can all be our full potential and become beautiful.

Imagine a handsome, kind, sexy, God-looking African (Doctor no-less), is interested in you because you are the most beautiful woman he has seen? He tells you this as me admires your round plush soft sweet curves. He is interested in marrying you, and respecting you, fulfilling your desires, and making you his Queen. Well that is just one tasty bit of this complex movie.

One of the tastiest bits being one of THE best kiss scenes I have seen in a long while.

I could never have imagined that my own life could mirror this movie. I was dating a wonderful gorgeous African King, when this movie came on video. I went to Africa, where the culture is rich and friendly. I was finally in a culture where my blessings were celebrated, and I felt like I was Giselle doing the cat walk down the street.

So everytime I watch this movie is like remembering when I was falling in love with my African King.

This movie may seem simple, but it holds deep emotions for anyone who has dreams and insecurities all in one.

It was nice to see a film with actresses who are not anorexic and who are self-confidant regardless of their looks. Too often a woman is valued only for her physical appearance. I thought all three actresses were attractive, funny, and did an excellent job. One bugaboo:  I would've liked to see her cousin develop a bit more empathy. The fact that she stood aside while Jaz took abuse rankled with this reviewer a bit.

1545538,3,B00005JOZ0,"I wasn't overly excited about this movie. I think it was just average at best. However, I read some of the previous reviews, and I won't call anybody out or anything, but here's what I gotta say about that. First of all, I just need to say that the person who posted approximately two posts up under mine needs to know that their review is the most hateful, childish, and unintelligent review that I've ever read since I've been on Amazon. I am in utter amazement at how rude and nasty this is towards fat people. None of that was necessary. You wanna talk about hate..It seems like you got a lot of hatred towards fat people. Maybe, it's just fat black people. Clearly, you knew nothing about Monique or her stand-up act as a comedienne before you watched this movie because if you did then you would know that Monique was just being the same Monique as always. Monique just represents big women period..white or black. Second of all, you talk about a big women getting oral sex like that's a bad thing. I don't care whether she was fat or skinny that's never a bad thing. I think you need to grow up because there are tons of men in the world that love themselves a big woman. On top of that, I don't here any complaints when men are getting serviced in that manner, so don't give Monique crap about it. If you don't like fat people, and by the hostility I read in this post it obvious that you don't, then I guess you should've found another movie to watch instead of ""PHAT GIRLZ"". Frankly, everything about this post is totally offensive and you should be ashamed of yourself. With that being said..Is this movie gonna win any Golden Globe or Academy Awards? absolutely not! Is this movie a masterpiece or a major piece of cinema that's gonna impact the world? absolutely not? This movie is just for pure enjoyment and nothing more. It's not meant to antagonize or inspire hatred. It's not black vs white, nor is it fat vs skinny, but it is about accepting yourself no matter what you are. I think that's a message that needs to be heard around the world. Especially, when you have people dying to be thin, by starving themselves, or having a whole lot of uncalled for plastic surgeries. People need to be happy with what they are given instead of trying to look like the celebrities. With that being said, I also have to say that some of the scenes, and some of the language in this movie is kinda strong for a pg-13 rated movie. I wouldn't recommend letting a samll child watch it.",1174089600,,2487,4.420479302832244

  This movie has a great message, a great concept, and a script that had some bugs in it but was pretty good overall.  If you need a pick-me-up and you're into size acceptance, you have GOT to own this DVD.

  I'm sad to say this movie didn't survive long in the theaters for good reasons (and we NEEDED this movie to be in theaters to spread the ""good news"" about self-acceptance!)  Trouble is, this was the director's first, every single attempt at humor bombed horribly, and the acting was horrible.  On that last note, I will point out one exception: the scene in which Jazmin has a breakdown was an extremely strong moment, as was the following morning.  It was real, raw, and deeply moving; for a second it was easy to forget that you were watching a craptacular movie.

  I'm also confused by the fact that in terms of production values (lighting, props, camerawork, costuming) the first ten minutes or so of this movie are very strong, mostly.  As the movie wears on, things just get progressively more pathetic -- a previous reviewer was right in saying it looked as if it was being shot with a home video camera.  And I kept feeling nagged by all sorts of prop issues.  Why, for example, at that lavish Nigerian buffet are they using paper plates and plastic silverware while sitting on cheap metal/carpet ugly chairs?  Why doesn't that department store feel realistic?  Why, if Jazmin has really ""made it"" at the end of the movie, is she carried down the catwalk in a litter constructed of cardboard that looks as if it would fit better in a 3rd grade play?  It required the audience to be in a near-constant state of ""suspended disbelief"" in order to enjoy it.

  Oh, and speaking of the fashion show -- for the most part, those clothes were horrible, even though Jazmin was often dressed impressively.

  *sigh*  We're going to have to wait decades for anything like this to come around again and be done right.  So Phat Girlz is better than nothing.",1170288000,,1984,4.594285714285714

1545542,4,B00005JOZ0,"Jazmin Biltmore's really ""built""

A healthy, smart brick house

She feels that since she's overweight

She'll never find a spouse

She's into popping diet pills

To get down to size 6

But that's a feat for David Blaine,

And other guys with tricks

One day she wins a holiday

And heads off to Palm Springs

And never in her wildest dreams

Does she guess what this brings

She meets a man who really likes

That she's built like a dam

And although he's Nigerian

This is no money scam

She and her friend soon realize

That bigger can be better

She learns to love her curvy self

And not let folk upset her

This really gives her confidence

Her inner dream to voice

And soon she finds that she's the one

To give phat girlz a choice

A comedy with good intent

It's funny and it's smart

You'll learn that size don't matter

in the matters of the heart
