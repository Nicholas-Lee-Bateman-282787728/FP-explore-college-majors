4713588,3,B005JZBPAK,"I watched them all, and found three to be 3 star, and the others, I fell asleep waiting for the movie to get better.",1369008000,,116,3.875
4713589,5,B005JZBPAK,"Originally, I was looking for one particular film, which was not available as a single, but was included in this 6-film pack. I had not seen the other 5, so I said, ""what the heck, sounds like a bargain to me"". I am pleased with the pack; actually bought another one as well.",1366934400,11,275,4.2075471698113205

4713591,4,B005JZBPAK,Six movies for a cheap price. I watched them all to the end because I was avoiding housework. Some were charming and some were a little awkward and B movie style.,1365120000,,162,4.258064516129032
4713592,5,B005JZBPAK,Have enjoyed each one of the movies...acting and dialogue exceeded my expections.  Would not hesitate to purchase more of these types of movie compilattions.,1364947200,6,157,5.541666666666667
4713593,3,B005JZBPAK,"All stories are adult subject.  Some are harsh and difficult to watch, while 2 are excellent.  For the low cost it was worth the purchase.",1360454400,6,138,4.48
4713594,5,B005JZBPAK,"I rated this at 5 stars because 4 of the 6 films are excellent in quality and content. ""The Shipping News"" tops the 6 films for me,very good acting from major stars,lush locations and excellent story. ""About Adam"" is a close second, a very good story with some fine comic performances by the stars of the film. ""A Walk on The Moon"" was the surprise package for me, a strong story about family values,set in the sixties,taking place during a long summer holiday. Next came ""My Life So Far"", which turned out to be a story about life from a small boys point of view, interesting but a little slow. The other two films ""A Price Above Rubies"" is about a Jewish married couple,interesting to see Christopher Ecclestone in this role,good film,fine acting. Lastly ""A Month By The Lake"",an interesting study of older people who find love late in life. All in all a good buy for me.",1360281600,47,873,4.531645569620253
4713595,5,B005JZBPAK,Some of my favorite films.  I remember seeing these films years ago and now I can ejoy them when I want to watch some great films.,1357430400,7,130,4.0
4713606,5,B005JZBPAK,"I was wonderfully surprised to find that all of the movies were indeed very good, well worth purchasing.

They are fantastic value for money and a great way to build your collection",1390694400,,181,4.65625
4713607,5,B005JZBPAK,I buy these compilations for my sister for Christmas and birthdays because the price is unbeatable and you can't beat getting 6 or 8 new movies on one disc. It's awesome for space saving too! some of the movies are good and some are lame but that's all personal preference. I've found some new movies that I like that I wouldn't have given a chance had they not come on one of these compilation discs.,1389657600,2,401,4.36
4713608,5,B005JZBPAK,Six great movies all in one package.  I will spend many a pleasurable hour watching these special films.  Arrived ahead of time and in great shape.  Thanks will order again.,1389225600,2,173,4.7
4713609,4,B005JZBPAK,"Yippee - I love getting these multi-movie DVDs..... in this case ---- 6 films for the price of 1 --- that's my kind of deal. And I've only seen one of them so far. Yup, I'll definitely get more than my money's worth here.",1377734400,,221,4.045454545454546
4713610,4,B005JZBPAK,Loved these  movies.  If you like romantic movies I feel that you will enjoy these.  Quality of the dvds is excellent and they were shipped promptly.,1377475200,,149,4.653846153846154
4713611,3,B005JZBPAK,"I didn't care for the whole set of movies included in the pack, but for the most part it was okay.",1376352000,,98,3.7142857142857144
4713612,5,B005JZBPAK,"My favorite film on this six-pac is ""Shipping News"" with Kevin Spacey.  It is a very tender story and I love the film version of that beautiful novel. It's fun to visit Novia Scotia with the film and not have to leave your living room. The other films are good too but for me ""Shipping News"" is the best.",1375574400,,304,4.1525423728813555
4713613,1,B005JZBPAK,I wish I would have known how terrible the picture quality would be. I can't even stand to watch it. I gave it away.,1373414400,5,116,3.875
4713614,4,B005JZBPAK,"I personally bought the pack for two movies ""A Walk On The Moon"" and ""A Month By The Lake"". Both movies are very entertaining with good performances by Diane Lane and Liev Schreiber in ""Moon"" and Vanessa Redgrave in ""Lake"". ""The Shipping News"" was too depressing for me but others may find it enjoyable. ""About Adam"" was a typical Kate Hudson movie (with the exception of ""Almost Famous""). ""A Price Above Rubies"" was missing something. I liked the movie but Renee Zellwegger seemed so miscast. I've yet to get through ""My Life So Far"". You do take your chances with movie packs. The price is definitely right!",1370390400,,609,4.700934579439252
4713615,5,B005JZBPAK,I love this type of movies. They are a few R rated moments. I think that these movies are directed to the grown-ups but still very good movies.,1370217600,,143,4.142857142857143
