8705459,4,B00UDFRHX0,I use this with my rowing machine at home! It works! The scenery is interesting because you can see the changes in vegetation as you go lower in elevation. The flow varies some allowing you to do double time when the pace is a little slower so you get a good workout. I really like having something to watch while I row. This keeps me motivated!,1467504000,,345,4.242424242424242
8705460,5,B00UDFRHX0,"This DVD includes a walk through the snow in the high Alpine mountains, which gives me a great feeling of calm and coolness.  There are wonderful views of rugged, snow-capped peaks surrounded by clouds, and I can see a turquoise lake with a slight covering of ice.

There is a fast-flowing steam beside me with the sounds of the water gurgling around the rocks, and this generates a lovely, invigorating feeling for me.  Then I find myself walking among green farmland with rustic, wooden fences  and cowbells ringing in my ears.  There are picturesque Alpine villages and a church lodged on top of a grassy hillside with its tower pointing to the bright blue sky.  Next it feels as if I am on a nature trail through lush green, wooded parkland.  Then, creating a gentle sense of peace, dusk is falling as the sun sets over the distant mountain tops.",1432598400,,850,4.626666666666667
8705461,5,B00UDFRHX0,"Indulge the armchair traveler within you with a choice of 3 walks (or cycling journeys) through amazing scenery in the Alpine mountains.  If you love the mountains, this DVD is for you.  This is fabulous, real scenery  not CG graphics -- and the DVD played beautifully on my HDTV.  All three walks have captured the sounds of nature, whether its the wind whistling through trees, birds calling, or water rushing by in a river.

In walk 1, enter the realm of the high Swiss Alps with powerful snow-capped peaks where you feel you can touch the clouds.  This segment has its own stark beauty and varied topography, including glacial rivers and all sorts of snow-covered rocky scenery.  End your journey at a beautiful lake as you head to a nearby chalet where you can probably enjoy a much needed rest!

In walk 2, enjoy a trek through the incredible Dolomite Mountains.  Youll head past a chalet, go under bridges with stone embankments and meander through lush forests - watch out for fellow travelers on your journey whether in cars or on motorcycles.  I especially loved the feeling of heading through the mountains towards incredible peaks while going past split-rail fences and meadows.

Walk 3 was one of my favorites.  It was peaceful and breathtakingly beautiful with the only interruption being an occasional cyclist or two.  A winding bike path takes you next to a river and through lush, beautiful greenery.  The walk then changes a bit as you work your way through meadows and forests.  The ever-present Alps are amazing.  Loved the end of the walk as you come into a small, picturesque town.  Only wish I could have stopped and sat down on one of the benches just to enjoy the view!

Working out was never this fun before!  Time literally flew by.  Thanks Tony and crew for another great DVD.",1430611200,2,1804,4.721153846153846
8705462,5,B00UDFRHX0,"This is a great video for those of us who love the mountains and the snow.  You have a choice of three different walks.  My favorite is number one it is as if you are walking at a higher elevation in the mountains complete with the melting snow along the walkway.  The nature sounds are realistic from mountain winds to streams.  The clouds are ever changing.  One of the walks even includes a darkening sky which I found most enjoyable.  There is even a scene that includes cowbells in the distance.  Very nice dvd.
I own several of the Isis Visual/World Nature Videos by Tony Helsloot and they are some of the best I've found.  I purchased many nature, fireplace, aquarium dvds for relaxation and exercise accompaniment.  However, their dvds are by far the best quality.  They are realistic and many have music and nature sounds.",1429574400,,831,4.63013698630137
8705463,5,B00UDFRHX0,"This is a wonderful DVD. I just finished watching all 3 tracks - each has its own special features. My personal favorite is Track 1 - I LOVE it! I love the snow, the mountain peaks AND the fact that the clouds are hanging so low some of the time, it makes me feel like I'm walking right in the clouds! Then there's the beautiful turquoise lakes here and there. I was fascinated by this walk. With all the differences including the rocky landscape and sometimes huge snow piles (from previous plowing) at the side of the road, I didn't take my eyes off this one.

Walk 2 is quite different - the majesty of the mountains in the background is awe-inspiring - I'd love to see the Alps in person, but since I can't, this is the next best thing. When you get to the spot where the sun is shining over the top of the peaks, it's really beautiful and almost feels surreal. The blue sky on both Walks 2 and 3 are also brilliant!  This is a great walk/cycle track too.

Walk 3 is my least favorite of the 3, but only because there are less of the mountains to be seen. It's a gorgeous green walk on a cycle path with a rushing stream along side at times. It really is pretty there, but to me, this film looks similar to other forest walks. Walks 2 and especially Walk 1 are more unique.",1429315200,,1277,4.161943319838056
8705464,5,B00UDFRHX0,"This DVD is different than the other Virtual Walks DVDs which I know. Here you can work out in the snow or in the sun. Video 1 is my favorite, where you are high in the mountains and you feel as if you can touch the clouds. The waysides are sometimes very snowy and you can also see blue-green mountain lakes on which is partly also snow. With this video, jogging is very suitable. In video 2, it goes very fast-paced from the sunny and green mountain country back to the mountains in the snow. In the sunny section you can hear the cowbells ringing, then it will dim to a mystical backdrop of snow-covered rocks. Video 3 performs bright green meadows and forests, as someone imagines the hill country. A very varied and scenically impressive DVD, which is great fun particularly on the exercise bike.",1429315200,,801,4.493150684931507
8705465,3,B00UDFRHX0,"If someone likes walking in cold environments, then this DVD is for you.  However, this is not one of my favourites ""Virtual Walks"" workouts. I personally like the ones that are filmed on a sunny spring/summer/autumn day, with lots of varied landscapes. In this particular DVD I think Walk 3 is the best and shows really nice scenery and it travels at the right pace, but Walks 1 and 2, which show for the most part rocky mountains covered in snow, did not keep my interest.  There is not much variety in Walk 1 and although Walk 2 is better in that sense, I felt it belonged more in a 'Virtual Cycle' DVD, because the pace is somewhat too fast for walking.  You can watch a trailer on the producer's website www.worldnaturevideo.com and also of the other many DVDs in this collection.  I generally like most of these DVDs very much, but unfortunately this is not one of them.",1429228800,3,876,4.490566037735849
