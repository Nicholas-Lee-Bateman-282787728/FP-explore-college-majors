8726030,5,B012D2WXDO,"Gustafer puts out another great album that kids and adults will love. The food themed songs are better than ever, from the peaceful but haunting Strawberry Love to the catchy, upbeat Brightest Beef. This is our 4th album owned by Mr. Taylor. Definitely a keeper!",1444435200,,262,4.844444444444444
8726031,5,B012D2WXDO,"My kids (5 & 2) LOVE Gustafer Yellowgold. We saw the band and the animations in concert last year and they're still talking about it. The music would work in ANY rock setting (meaning great for grown-ups too...seriously!), and the Gustafer character is about as fun and quirky as anything you've seen since Spongebob. Forget nursery rhymes. Gustafer's got the new kids jam, and it's totally out of this world!",1441411200,2,409,4.857142857142857
