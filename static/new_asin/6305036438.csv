951907,5,6305036438,"Of course, most of it is an ""artists impression"", but based on what everyone knows about these two men with many eccentricities and very strong personalities. Bob Gunton does a great Dick Nixon and Rick Peters does a really good Elvis, minus the singing voice. The factuality which the story is based on is the letter Elvis sent to Nixon which is fantastic itself and the photo of Elvis in the purple cape suit with the President in the Oval Office - proof that the meeting did occur.

Of course the film is meant to be a comedy, and it is very funny. A lot of the funny stuff is based on ""legends"" that have a good grounding in the truth as well: Elvis really did stop at a donut shop on his way to the Washington Hotel and he really did check in then fly to LA without checking out. We're told that by the narrator's who are played by themselves - Graham Nash, Tony Curtis, Art Linklater, Wayne Newton who repeatedly intone ""You can't make this up!""

If you like political satire and character studies you'll enjoy it, if the only comedy you enjoy is slap-stick and sit-com style comedy, then you might not get it.",1092528000,7,1116,4.360576923076923
951908,5,6305036438,"I saw this movie on Showtime back in 1998, and have been hoping it will break into the DVD market soon.  A brilliant account of true events.  It gives you an enjoyable experience of the King of Rock and Roll, as he journeys around Haight-Ashbury and then around DC, ultimately visiting with President Nixon in the hopes of becoming a DEA agent to fight the war on drugs.  A great insight into the similarities of two totally different characters, Elvis and Nixon!",1087689600,8,463,4.621951219512195
951909,4,6305036438,"This highly entertaining, hilarious film, that originally aired on Showtime; examines the time that Elvis flew to Washington, D.C. to meet President Nixon to convince the President to make him a federal marshall. The movie is very loosely based on fact and as the film's narrator points out, if that's not the way things happened then it should have been. This movie portrays Elvis and Nixon as two very similar persons on opposite sides of the cultural spectrum. The film also illustrates how very human these two powerful giants were and that besides their power, the only thing that separated them from ""the rest of us"" were their very odd eccentricies. Highly enjoyable film.",1052611200,5,679,4.964912280701754

951911,5,6305036438,"I was too young to appreciate Elvis and I hated Nixon with all my heart. This said, both of these figures are larger than life and this movie plays it for laughs and gets them. I have showed this movie to several friends(I saw it 5 times in one week). Everyone of them loved it and still can't believe they had never heard of this movie. It is a great romp.",998956800,8,357,4.042253521126761
951912,5,6305036438,"This made for t.v. movie is an undiscovered gem. From the very beginning when Elvis shoots out the t.v. because he hates Robert Goulet, you know you are watching something special. Rick Peters does a great Elvis, and Bob  Gunton is an hysterically funny Nixon. This movie has great lines, and my  teenage kids loved it as well. It is something to watch when you want to  laugh. Hopefully, it will be re-released on VHS or DVD. It might be the  best movie no one has seen.",945820800,8,471,4.379310344827586
951913,5,6305036438,"With cameos from Dick Cavett, Edwin Newman and Wayne Newton, ""Elvis Meets Nixon"" is an hysterical look into the famous photograph taken in December, 1970. The film primarily focuses on Elvis's real-life trek to the  White House where he discovers just how out-of-sync he is with American  culture of the late 60s. Along the way, Elvis holds up a donut shop,  badmouths some hippies, shoots a few televisions and eats lots of airplane  food. Through it all, President Nixon ponders the fact that the children of  America hate him while he considers adding the Beatles to his infamous  enemies list. Bob Gunton as Nixon and Rick Peters as Elvis are sensational  as they inadvertantly create one of the greatest ""buddy"" scenes  in film history. Gunton, an established actor, richly deserved awards for  his show-stopping performance. Hilarious and almost heartbreaking, this  film truly taps into the future plummets of both American icons. Any buff  of contemporary American history should check out this little gem that is  as tasty as a peanut butter and nanner sandwich.",911606400,9,1071,5.091954022988506
7881093,5,6305036438,"This is a brilliant movie, celebrating the wonderous world of Elvis myth and reality. ""...when the legend is better than the truth, print the legend"" - an old moral from the days when editors had them.",1480464000,,201,4.611111111111111

7881096,5,6305036438,The reason I gave this movie five stars is because the story is so cool and yet also bizarre at the same time.,1427328000,,110,3.8260869565217392
7881097,5,6305036438,"Stumbled across this movie one night right around Aug. 2012. Gotta say it's a great comedic twist to a side of Elvis few may actually know. Very entertaining and cleverly funny to the point where you ask yourself, ""what in the world is he going to do next!"" I am a big Elvis fan and there are times during the movie when I want to believe things happened exactly like the movie suggests with regards to Elvis' humor, wit, and generosity. A great movie and fun to watch.",1348099200,2,469,4.340909090909091
7881098,1,6305036438,"I find it sad that so many purported Elvis fans find this ""mockumentary"" funny. There are amusing bits, yes, but most come at the expense of the actual truth, not the ""truth"" the film makers sell. That's what makes this film most offensive to me. You can (and they did) make up so much of this stuff! Do your homework, ""fans."" While the general outline of meeting Nixon is true, there was no walk on Sunset strip, no record shop moment, etc.  So many scenes have been manufactured. The fact that neither Sonny West nor Jerry Shilling would lend their names to it as ""characters"" tells you something, particularly since they were there for some of that actual meeting. What this is is a hodgepodge of various moments arranged by movie folks with an ax to grind, if not with Elvis, most certainly with Nixon. I can't respect that kind of ""truth.""",1337990400,,844,4.552631578947368
7881099,5,6305036438,"I saw this movie on tely about 4 years ago and loved it, so funny. Rick Peters did an amazing job as ELVIS as did the actor who portrayed Nixon.  I have tried everywhere (the past 4 years ) to buy this video, with no luck. Then I heard someone talking about Amazon. I now have my video and was so impressed with the quick service from amazon and the supplier. I received the package within a week in perfect condition, I couldn't be happier.",1261958400,5,441,4.188235294117647

7881101,5,6305036438,"Another ""made-for-Showtime"" original movie that wildly exceeded expectatations (see also my review of the Patrick Stewart vehicle ""Safe House""), ""Elvis Meets Nixon"" details the two days in December of 1970 when Elvis Presley, for reasons known but to himself, left his home in home in Memphis, Tennessee on his own for the first time in his adult life, criss-crossing the country to Washington, DC, then to Los Angeles, CA, and finally back to DC for a meeting with...President Richard Nixon.
Of course it's all a dramatization of events, and perhaps more than just a bit of artistic license has been taken with the two main characters' personalities.  But as an Elvis fan who holds the artist and the man with reverence, I found this to be one of the funniest movies I have ever watched.  The almost child-like detachment from reality with which Elvis and Nixon lived their lives at the time is incomprhensible at times.  Bob Gunton's portrayal of President Nixon rivals that of Dan Hedaya in ""Dick"" (also made by Canadians, by the way) for sheer genius of comedic timing, and Rick Peters is so amazing as Elvis (the ""doughnut shop in DC"" scene is one of the most amazingly surreal moments I've ever seen on film...and I own ""Bubba Ho-tep"", as well) that it took my about six viewings of this movie to realize that he has brown eyes rather than the King's royal blue (how did that detail get overlooked in pre-production?).
Everything that occurs in this movie takes place from a slightly skewed angle; of course it could not possibly happen today (could it?), but to the amazement of everyone, Elvis was able to pull it off some 35 years ago (""Watch and learn, son...watch and learn"").  The ""interviews"" with contemporary artists Wayne Newton, Tony Curtis, and Stephen Stills(?) as well as Dick Cavett and the surviving ""characters"" associated with Elvis and Nixon at the time are hilarious, as well.  The documentary angle is well-played, but the individual performances of Peters and Gunton (try to keep a straight face whenever Nixon swears in this movie, I dare you) are really what carry this movie.
For better or worse, Elvis and Nixon did more to shape the culture of the second half of the 20th Century than practically anyone else; it is natural that they seem somehow inevitably drawn together, and this movie tells the story the way I truly and dearly wish it had actually happened.  I'll be watching it tonight (16 August, ""Ascension Day"", as I call it) eating doughnuts and cheeseburgers.  You'd do well to check this one out, as well.",1124150400,17,2550,4.808219178082192
7881102,5,6305036438,"I just recently saw this movie with a group of friends, some die-hard fans like myself, and others who know very little about Elvis. This movie was great! Everyone enjoyed and laughed out loud at the absurdity of the reality these two men lived in. Both were so out of touch with everyday life... they were destined to find each other in this truly ironic way.

As a life-long fan, and someone who has seen virtually every incarnation of Elvis, real or unreal or surreal, on film - I can truly say this is informative inspite of it's inevitable truth and silliness. You really can't make this stuff up. If you can find this one, pick it up immediately!",1117238400,7,652,4.4789915966386555
