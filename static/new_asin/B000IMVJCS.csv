8146409,5,B000IMVJCS,"This documentary features three scholars discussing the historical evidence for Jesus.  A lot of the footage is filmed on location in Rome and Jerusalem which is interesting.  And there is some very good information contained within the video regarding history and Christ.  The Josephus document regarding Jesus is talked about at length and the parable of the coin and render under Ceasar what is Ceasar's is very well explained.  My one complaint is that the scholars make some pretty bold and broad sweeping statements without giving us a specific example to back it up.  For example, the American scholar based in Israel says Jesus was a genius.  That the way he puts together the Old Testament and the New Testament semantically is highly intellectual.  That is the sort of thing we'd love to be able to repeat to folks, but he doesn't tell us a specific case of when Jesus does that for us to repeat.  And this happens repeatedly throughout the movie, which is a little exasperating at times from an intellectual point of view.  However, there are enough historical details to make it worth the while such as there still being remnants of an earthquake that took place at the time of Jesus being nailed upon the Cross being visible under the Dome of the Rock.  So the movie is worth the while to pique one's curiosity, but it will also leave one yearning for more.  Which in the end, is an excellent thing for it to achieve.",1329955200,,1430,4.68
8146410,5,B000IMVJCS,"The evidence for the existence of Jesus is stronger than any other historical person according to Michael Green, Internationally renowned theologian from England. Joined by American scholar Steven Notley and Dutch scholar Jacob van Bruggen, Green uses historical resources, literature, and archeology in this exploration to answer yes to three important questions. ""Did Jesus exist?"", ""Was Jesus more than merely human?"" and ""Was the resurrection an actual event?"" The scholars discuss Josephus's account of Christ and defend the reliability of the Gospels. The validity of Jesus' miracles is also examined. Bruggen asserts that the reality of Jesus' power was so evident in the first century that no one living at that time even attempted to deny it. Another argument is made in defense of the reliability of the Gospels, examining how these multiple accounts of the same events prove that they really happened and noting that it is also clear that the Gospel writers did not embellish their stories because at times they even put themselves in a bad light. A variety of topics are discussed including Jesus' family, his respect for women, and the construction of the temple and its destruction. We are asked to study first century Jewish culture, to hear the words of eye witnesses as they would have, and to read the gospels as historical biography seeing Jesus as a person in Jewish history.

Bonus features on Behold the Man include excerpts from other Vision Video DVDs, including Jesus, the New Way; So, Who Is This Jesus?; and The Incomparable Christ, which features a lecture given by John Stott. Also include on the DVD is a downloadable PDF with an annotated program script with discussion questions. This on location 43-minute documentary is a mix of apologetics and historical information, making it a good choice for adult education or small study group discussion. Ideal for Christians who want an introduction to historical studies of Jesus.",1213315200,6,1957,5.154088050314465
