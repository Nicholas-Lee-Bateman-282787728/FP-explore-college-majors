7882200,5,6305063850,This woman makes it look so so easy.  I had to have this tape for my own.  I had borrowed it so many times from the library that they were thinking of putting my picture on the box alongside Debbie's.  The faux tortoiseshell finish is very neat and I am contemplating just what thrift store find to bestow it upon.  She is very adept at teaching you how to take mediocre items and make them into one of a kind pieces.  With that charming British accent she is a pleasure to watch and listen.,1160006400,,491,4.180851063829787
