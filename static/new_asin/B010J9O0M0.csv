7313441,5,B010J9O0M0,"The private eyes in ""I Love a Mystery"" are a pretty bland lot compared to Boston Blackie or the Lone Wolf, but I am a sucker for all B-Movie Detective series.
And I love a mystery.

Back in the 1940s, Columbia Pictures produced overlapping B-Movie Detective series.
The studio was competing with itself:
-- The Lone Wolf: fifteen films 1935 to 1949 - nine starring Warren William
-- Boston Blackie: fourteen films 1941 to 1949 - starring Chester Morris
-- Crime Doctor: ten films 1943 to 1949 - starring Warner Baxter
-- The Whistler: eight films 1944 to 1948 - seven starring Richard Dix
-- I Love a Mystery: three films 1945 to 1946 - starring Jim Bannon and Barton Yarborough

Warren William, Chester Morris, Warner Baxter and Richard Dix had been Hollywood stars in the early Thirties.
But their careers were clearly on a downward trajectory by the time they signed with Columbia.
In contrast, the stars of ""I Love a Mystery"" - Jim Bannon and Barton Yarborough - were anonymous radio actors whose film careers were virtually non-existent outside of these three films.

""I Love a Mystery"" was a detective serial on radio from 1939 to 1944.
Jack, Doc and Reggie were three soldiers of fortune who joined forces to form the A-1 Detective Agency.
Their slogan was ""No job too tough, No adventure too baffling"".
Unfortunately, the actor who played Reggie committed suicide in 1942, but Jack and Doc carried on without him.

The screenplays are pretty intricate, with a strong element of the gothic and supernatural - In the first two films, the victim is beheaded; the third film is a haunted house mystery.
I imagine these scripts would have worked equally well for any of the other detectives on Columbia's roster.
Three films, each slightly longer than an hour, on one disc.
Picture quality is only fair, but the sound is good.
DVD-R, but it played fine.
No subtitles.

As an unadvertised bonus, OnesMedia enclosed a copy of a 1973 ""I Love a Mystery"" made-for-TV movie.
Horrible.
Former ABC newsman Les Crane was cast as Jack.
Future ABC newsman David Hartman (first host of Good Morning America) was cast as Doc.
Also Ida Lupino and Don Knotts.
Grotesque.

GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD
A-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.
B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.
Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)

PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE
- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.
- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).
- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.
- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss. He never actually reformed, but was conked over the head and woke up with amnesia.

PHILIP MARLOWE / SAM SPADE
These two detectives were the most famous Private Eyes of all time, but they don't really belong on this list.
They were A-Movie detectives all the way:
- 1931 The Maltese Falcon: Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade
- 1936 Satan Met a Lady: Warren William as Sam Spade - adapted from 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett
- 1941 The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade
- 1944 Murder, My Sweet: Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'Farewell, My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
- 1946 The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 Lady in the Lake: Robert Montgomery as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 The Brasher Doubloon: George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'The High Window"" by Raymond Chandler

But two Philip Marlowe novels were adapted as B-Movies for other detectives:
- 1942 Time to Kill (Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne) - adaptated from 'The High Window' by Raymond Chandler
- 1942 The Falcon Takes Over (George Sanders as The Falcon)) - adapted from 'Farewell My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
