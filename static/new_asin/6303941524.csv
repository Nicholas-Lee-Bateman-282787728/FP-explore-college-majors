Proving that people can change if given a better goal and incentive and why and that it can be done no matter where you came from, who you are, and that life is what you make of it... And if you truly want enemies are only enemies because you make it that way

I <3 This Movie",1360886400,,454,3.778947368421053
7856502,2,6303941524,"Soldier Boyz, where to start? The plot of this movie isn't really believable at all.. It is about a humanitarian, Gabriel, who is captured by a post war north Vietnamese radical group. Oppose to what would really happen, a SEAL team sent to rescue her. It is decided that former Marine and Nam veteran (Micheal) will be contracted by the father of Gabriel whom is a millionaire. Micheal's character working in a correctional facility demands that he gets to take some of those prisoners with him and those who survive the mission get a full pardon.

The movie seems like it wasn't thought out and was directed by someone who knew very little about the military and procedure. One small thing i noticed was Micheal's character is a former Marine yet the officer whom comes with Gabriel's father is in the uniform of a Army officer. While it is possible they did serve side by side in Nam it is unlikely that he would've be in direct command of Marine units which intern would be Micheal. That is one little thing i noticed about the film and how it delivered the story.

This movie seems like someone watched The Dirty Dozen and decided to make a remake with a change in plot and setting. This movie is a lot of B-list acting and B-list action. It does have a few funny moments like when one of the guys was being questioned if he liked his MRE (Meal Ready to Eat which is military food used in the field).

I cannot make myself waste more time talking about this movie. It was chalk full of inaccuracies, unrealistic fights, poor acting, mediocre action, and a completely unrealistic plot.

Soldier Boyz is not a good movie it earns 2/5 stars.",1353283200,,1643,4.521885521885522
7856503,1,6303941524,"Ok, this movie wasn't good at all. I didn't like it one bit, I'm glad I recorded it on DVR instead of buying it. I will never waste my time watching this crappy movie ever again, the actors were probably too good for this movie. Please don't waste your time on this film!",1310860800,,271,4.132075471698113

Plenty of action and some interesting issues for the thought. Well edited and a secure direction.",1199318400,6,335,4.583333333333333
7856506,5,6303941524,A former U.S. marine takes six teen prisoners into Vietnam to fight the terrorist and rescue a girl who is held hostage in Vietnam. Three of the prisoners have died in the war. What was a great ending for me was when the black guy blew up the chopper.,1121644800,2,251,4.142857142857143
7856507,5,6303941524,"Too bad there wasn't a showdown between Michael Dudikoff and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Real ""Mortal Kombat"" time, but no. As long as lots of stuff blows up, this movie, ""Soldier Boyz"" is a treat to any action fan. Halloween has come early to me every time I watch this movie. At least I can watch this and its content will not harm my teeth like sugar. Maybe my brain, but this stuff is Lordage, with a capitol L. ""Don't move means don't move,"" yes, you tell them Tolliver (Dudikoff). Those misfits are only kids. That boy on the bridge messed it up, asinine child. The movie is funny to watch at times, so please put this on DVD now!",1044144000,7,630,4.3474576271186445
7856508,4,6303941524,"the problem with people today is that they don't know how to sit back and enjoy a movie without picking at it and destroying the mood. Soldier Boyz is one movie that I feel people write off as being stupid and predictable  and so not possible. But I say. Hello people of course not its a movie!  anywho the story takes off when a rich girls plane is shot down over a  modern day vietnam. She is then taken hostage by a terrorist who demands  war funds for her safty. And now it is up to a bitter war hardend youth  prison worker to get her back. but only under one condition. he can bring  six of his vicious teen inmates with him with the promise of freedom for  anyone who survives the mission. And so he joins forces with a skin head,a  drug dealer,a gangbanger,a rapist,a wrongfully accused martial artist, and  for fun, a axe weilding street smart girl. Once in vietnam they have to  learn to get over their differences or it could be lights out for these  teens! I really enjoyed this movie becuse of its hidden message to get  people to overcome racism towards color and sex in order to complete a  goal. Also a whole lotta stuff explodes and the action is exciting! And  also my personal congradulations to Demetius Navarro who played Lopez,my  favorite charecter. Dont miss this flik it will definitly become a  favorite.",948931200,6,1330,4.45643153526971
7856509,3,6303941524,This movie is okay but the fact that taking people out of prison to fight instead of a really special forces squad to do the job well watch it see what I meen,945302400,2,158,3.8181818181818183
