7878569,5,6304860714,"I found this 52-minute long video quite fascinating.  The segment on the Soviet downing of civilian flight KAL 007 over international air space in the summer of 1983 details the many unexplained mysteries surrounding this extremely significant tragedy.  It is somewhat surprising that this incident has faded out of the national memory; it occurred at a time of heightened Cold War tensions between the world's two superpowers and did much to empower President Reagan's initiatives for fighting (and eventually defeating) the menace of Soviet aggression and Communism.  It provides a good summary of the facts we have on the case: the Korean airliner embarked on a flight path well north of its proper one, sent false signals to tracking stations of its location, veered into Soviet airspace over particularly important military functions not once but twice, and was shot down by a Soviet jet's heat-seeking missile.  It covers the stories put out by the American, Soviet, and Japanese governments, noting the contradictions inherent in these ""official"" versions and the fact that information was almost definitely withheld on all sides.  It presents speculative theories in an objective, lucid manner-in particular, the suggestion that the plane was being used to gain intelligence on Soviet capabilities, including newly installed long-range radar stations.  It mentions initial reports of the plane actually making a safe landing and the notion some have made that the plane was shot down for the principal reason of killing controversial Georgia Congressman Larry McDonald, but it does not dwell on such more extreme conspiracy theories.  One thing it does not do is cover the quite probably tampered black box data the Russians eventually released after many years of assertions as to their nonexistence.
The Chernobyl segment is also quite good.  As the years pass, it is easy to forget the significance of the disaster that took place there, although the thousands upon thousands of innocent individuals suffering short-term as well as long-term consequences remember it all too well.  The video offers a basic, easily understandable explanation of what went wrong.  Many people may not realize just how much stupidity went into the tragic event.  Plant personnel were running a test on the reactor, during which they shut off all of the emergency systems; when they detected the core's temperature continually rising to dangerous levels, they plodded on with their work without restoring any of the systems that would have prevented what happened.  Chernobyl epitomizes the impracticability of the whole Soviet system: corruption, lack of incentive, and human mistakes eventually blew up in the system's face, then the Soviets attempted to lie and cover up the extent of the damage only to be forced to admit everything many days later as irrefutable proof in the form of a huge radioactive cloud began to settle over all of Europe.  The video does spend a good deal of time detailing the cleanup efforts that went into preventing a complete nuclear meltdown, offering true praise to the heroes, many of them volunteers, who withstood incredibly high levels of radiation (which, it must be said, their government did not make them fully aware of) in an effort to contain the disaster.
The videos in this Myths and Mysteries of the Twentieth Century series are a little uneven in terms of quality, but this particular one is exceedingly well done, informative, and very interesting indeed.",1041033600,10,3496,5.232558139534884
