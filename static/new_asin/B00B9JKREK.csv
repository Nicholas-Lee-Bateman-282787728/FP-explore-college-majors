5564448,4,B00B9JKREK,"I wasn't going to watch this because I thought it was going to be bad. Boy, was I surprised. First of all, I will say there is some dialogue in the movie that seemed kind of off to me as filler material which slows the movie down in certain parts. But with that said, the beginning to the movie is fantastic. We get some background during the opening credits and it's spaced out nicely. There are a lot of parts in the movie where they have different coloring used in scenes and different artistic angles, etc- it's awesome. It's very different for a horror movie and it looks really nice. The cinematography is excellent. The acting is even pretty good. I loved the old school horror feel to it. A lot of people haven't mentioned the sack the killer wears on his head- there are a couple of scenes with him wearing it that are just extremely creepy the way he looks at the camera. I got this through red box but this is one worth owning because it's so much fun. If you are huge fan of low budget  horror movies, you will love this even though it doesn't look real low budget. Excellent direction, photography, camera angles used, and pacing. Loved it. :)",1374364800,4,1156,4.376744186046512

5564450,3,B00B9JKREK,"It's not bad for a first time ,small budget production. One or two spots where minor things noticed. Lacked blood and needed a few more kills earlier in film. Overall there are alot worse films out there.",1370563200,,204,4.54054054054054
5564451,2,B00B9JKREK,"This is a generally amateurish, low-budget film that has nothing new to contribute to the psycho-slasher genre. However, two things on the disc kept it from being a complete waste of time.

First, Richard Tyson delivers an occasionally arresting, professional performance. His narrative of the legend of Pitchfork did draw me close in around the campfire, listening to him. He has a more mature, macho ease that commands some respect on screen.

The second point of interest on the disc can be found among its bonus extras. It includes three audition videos. There's the audition of the young woman ultimately cast in the lead female role. Then it includes two different actors auditioning for the lead male role. There's quite a difference between their deliveries. With one, there is no ""chemistry"" with the female lead at all. He ended up being cast in a supporting role. The actor who ultimately got the lead role continues to read in a rather scripted fashion, but is definitely more animated.

More DVD's should include audition footage among their bonus features.",1370390400,,1070,5.033898305084746
5564452,1,B00B9JKREK,"I am a huge fan as is my husband of horror films. We have family in the entertainment industry in Hollywood and am not afraid to rent low budget or direct to DVD releases. This movie was terrible! Did not hold our interest at all. And, coming from having a son who does tons of horror movies and not all great ( don't tell him I said this) this movie was not watchable .",1369353600,,370,4.013513513513513
5564453,3,B00B9JKREK,"This pleasant low budget horror film takes place in LA (Lower Alabama). It has a main plot and a minor subplot. Steven (Jeremy Ivy) brings his girlfriend Amanda (Sherri Eakin) home with him around Halloween. We get to hear and see some of the local flavor as the film builds their character, lines like, ""You're not from around here"" and ""roads that go no where."" And of course every proud small town in the south has ""the best BBQ in the state."" They plan to take Capt. Morgan's Haunted Hayride, a local tradition which features ""pitchfork man"" based on a local story. Here in Barnwell, we have ""rakeman."" He doesn't kill people, he just rakes leaves, sort of like Sling-blade, but creepier.

Meanwhile a killer has escaped who might pass for Toj Johnson's son. In the opening scene the killer walks slow dragging an ax. He is able to catch up to a young panicking female at a flat out run...okay she stopped to rest for a second. A pair of odd couple cops are looking for him. Their lines were stale and predictable.

This was a low budget production. In spite of that the filming aspects, special effects, etc were done well. They filmed in color, didn't use any hand held stuff and had multiple camera angels (i.e. multiple cameras), just like real movies. The acting was so-so, to fairly decent. The Hayride itself takes nearly an hour to happen.

While the film wasn't bad, it barely held my interest. The dialouge was too boring with the opening restaurant scene lasting way too long. The slasher scenes needed panache. Makes for a mediocre rental. I won't rush out and buy.

5564454,5,B00B9JKREK,"As a Movie Lover I'm not a Slasher/Horror Movie Fan. This Movie was good and not to much Blood. Some gory parts but much less than I expected. Had a easy story to follow. Cool it was shot in my hometown of Fairhope, Alabama. For a low budget movie, the Director/Producer Terron R. Parsons (I know his Mom) did a good job. I'd watch it again. I gave it a 5 Star rating because of the talent effort on Terron's behalf, the familiar background areas, the interesting storyline and it kept me glued to my seat. Heard Hayride 2 was now being made, must be because of the twist at the end of Hayride. Watch it for yourself and see what you think. -Signed Movielover supports this local made Film.",1368057600,6,690,4.315384615384615

5564456,5,B00B9JKREK,A suspenseful movie with an actual storyline..  All of the horror aspects are purposeful and not much unnecessary gore.  But some of the kill scenes are pretty intense.  Definitely would recommend seeing this!,1361145600,5,209,5.2727272727272725
5564457,4,B00B9JKREK,"I'm usually not a big fan of horror/slasher movies but this one was surprisingly enjoyable and well-made. I saw a showing of ""Hayride"" at an actual corn maze in Summerdale, Alabama.
The atmosphere may have added to the spookiness of the film because there were a few moments (I'm not embarrassed to say) I almost jumped out of my seat. The acting was alot better than I expected, especially for a lower budget horror movie. And a pretty awesome twist at the end.
Besides a few moments where the audio is a little bad, it was pretty professionally made. Overall I really enjoyed Hayride! 4 Stars",1360540800,13,594,4.613207547169812

5564464,4,B00B9JKREK,"In Mobile, Alabama (filmed on location), the police surround an abandoned building. When the S.W.A.T. team enters, they find the rotting remains of six young girls, their bodies so badly decomposed, it will take a coroner to identify them. A serial killer named Guffin (Shannon Box) is chasing girl #7 in the adjoining woods and he kills her before the police arrest him. He's a brooding, overweight man whose stare could melt ice. The last time we see him (for the moment), he is in the back of a police car being transported to a penitentiary. We then see a young couple, Steven (Jeremy D. Ivy) and Amanda (Sherri Eakin; EARTHRISE - 2014) at a barbecue joint talking about making the long ride to participate in Steven's Uncle Morgan's (Richard Tyson; FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: OUTBREAK ON A PLANE - 2006; a character actor I have admired since the 1980's) annual Halloween Hayride, where characters such as ""Pitchfork"" and ""Rawhead Bloodybones"" run out of the darkness and scare the crap out of the people on the hayride. There is also a stop in the middle of the ride, where all the paying customers take a scary tour through a terror-filled barn. We are then at a crime scene on the side of the road, where there is a dead police officer in his car, an unknown male dead in the bushes nearby and Guffin, the serial killer, has escaped. Detective Loomis (Corlandos Scott; his screen name is probably a tribute to Donald Pleasence in HALLOWEEN - 1978), the lead detective on the case, says no one really knows Guffin, except he is ""bat-**** crazy"" and his next move would be to find clothes so he can discard his bright orange jumpsuit. Since neither of the two dead men are Guffin's large size, chances are he will be traveling to the nearest farm to try and find clothing. It looks like if they don't catch this murderous killer, there just may be a new Pitchfork for the Hayride this year (You may think you know what is going to happen, but most of you would be wrong). Steven takes Amanda to meet Uncle Morgan, but first Steven runs into cousin Corey (Jeremy Sande; UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: DAY OF RECKONING - 2012), who is glad to see Steven back in town, but they always make fun of each other (Corey gets the last licks in by calling Steven a ""dick"" and then driving off in his truck). Uncle Morgan is a womanizing letch (he has two women with him; one called ""Beautiful"" [Kara Riann Brown] and one called ""Dumb"" [Kelly Houk]), but he is also a very good guy who cares about the quality of the Halloween Hayride to make sure that people get their money's worth (He jokingly hits on Amanda, but pulls Steven aside and tells him not to let this one go. She seems like a keeper. Steven agrees.). A short distance away, Guffin steals some rope from the back of a truck and kills the driver (off-screen) with a sledgehammer. Around a campfire that night, Steven asks Uncle Morgan who is playing Pitchfork this year (Morgan retired ""Rawhead Bloodybones"" from the hayride when his grandfather passed away, since he was the one who created and played him), but since Steven is just a paying customer this year (but he is still family and helps all he can before the hayride commences), Morgan won't tell him. Morgan relays a story to everyone (in a really bad flashback technique) that Pitchfork was once an actual person. He was a farmer named R.W. Rayborn (Wayne Dean), who always carried a pitchfork with him whenever his beautiful daughter was with him to keep all the young men away from her. Morgan believes Pitchfork murdered his wife (with a meat cleaver) for letting his daughter run away with a young man. Since Pitchfork doesn't know who the young man is, he goes from farm to farm killing everyone in his path, both man and woman, leaving a trail of dead bodies in his wake. Morgan believes that Pitchfork never found his daughter or the young man and then Corey comes jumping out of the darkness carrying a pitchfork, scaring the crap out of everyone around the campfire. Morgan says that the story of Pitchfork is still true. The night before the Halloween Hayride, it rains like hell, destroying a lot of the props outside, but Morgan is an optimist and his unending drive to rebuild everything is infectious, so everyone (including Amanda) chips in to restore the hayride's attractions to their former state. Two police officers are doing a house-to-house search for Guffin and they check out an abandoned house, only to be run through and chopped-up with a machete by someone dressed like Pitchfork. The Halloween Hayride begins and Morgan only has one rule: Make the first couple of rides children-friendly so they don't go home scared out of their minds (this man really cares about his customers), but go balls-to-the-wall on all the rides after that. But I highly doubt that Morgan meant that in the literal sense. Pretty soon, Pitchfork is using his favorite weapon to start dispatching some of the hayride riders. Detective Loomis and Deputy Wincer (Randy Hicks) show up at the hayride and Wincer tells Loomis that the legend of Pitchfork is real (most legends are based on true events that are over-amplified, except this one). By the time they get to the hayride, half of the workers left or are dead and a S.W.A.T. team finds the remains of the two police officers in the abandoned house, so Loomis and Wincer go there. As more and more people end up dead (and hidden), Morgan wants to put on the last hayride for the night, but he is short-handed, so Amanda volunteers to portray the victim that gets pulled off the cart by the resident psycho. By now, Pitchfork is killing people out in the open, because the audience (many of them drunk) think that it is part of the show. When Steven accidentally knocks himself out in the woods and comes to, he discovers a dead body and races to save Amanda on the hayride. Pitchfork plants an axe in the skull of a Jason Voorhees-wannabe and then attacks everyone on the hayride with a chainsaw (and killing a few), Morgan intervenes and tries to keep Pitchfork busy with a machete. It doesn't last long, as Pitchfork thrusts the chainsaw into Morgan's body and kidnaps Amanda (it will make sense in a little while). A couple of days earlier, Morgan complained that someone stole all his bear traps and we now see them in use, as the survivors of the hayride run into the woods and have their legs caught in bear traps or killed with other booby-traps. Steven makes it to the hayride a little too late, where he finds his Uncle Morgan dead and severed body parts littering the hayride carts, so he grabs a machete and goes out to save Amanda and get a little payback, to boot. He finds Amanda tied-up in the Terror Barn, the hayride's midway-through walk-through horror maze, and gets into a fight with Pitchfork. Both an untied Amanda and Steven are still trapped in the barn's maze (Pitchfork sees a fake arm come out of a wall to scare customers, pulls it out and throws it to the floor). Pitchfork runs his favorite weapon through one of Steven's hands, but Steven manages to get away and runs outside. Amanda is now being chased by Pitchfork, but he is impaled in the stomach by a broken handle of a pitchfork sticking out of the ground. He pulls himself off the handle and moves closer and closer to Steven and Amanda, but he falls to the ground just before he gets to them. Amanda then tells Steven she is pregnant (Really? This is the right time to make such an announcement?) and Corey comes jumping out of the darkness telling the couple that everyone is dead (a little late bonehead!). Detective Loomis, Deputy Wincer and the police force finally show up, where at least a dozen people are dead and dozens injured (Thankfully, bear traps don't kill unless you fall face-first into one of them). When Loomis and Wincer pull the burlap bag off of Pitchfork's face, it turns out to be R.W. Rayborn (Who we see in flashback kill serial killer Guffin for being in his barn. Imagine that; a serial killer being killed by another serial killer.). Wincer asks Loomis, ""Is he dead?""  to which Loomis replies, ""No!"" (Amanda reminded Rayborn of his daughter). Start the end credits, but stick through to the end for two small stingers which sets up the basis for the 2015 sequel HAYRIDE 2, which contains some of the same characters in this film (Steven, Amanda, Corey, Detective Loomis, Pitchfork, all played by the same actors here and made by the same director/screenwriter) and borrows a lot of footage from this film (which is why Richard Tyson is listed as being in the cast). Only this time Pitchfork is a bigot, too (look for clues in this film when the two police officers check out the abandoned house) This is enjoyable for what it is, but totally predictable, especially to fans of slasher films. I guessed that Guffin wasn't Pitchfork halfway through the film and most slasher fanatics probably did, too. The always dependable Richard Tyson (THE BLACK WATERS OF ECHO'S POND - 2009) throws himself into the role even though it is obvious this was a low-budget film that was going directly to DVD and streaming. He's a dog in this film when it comes to women, but family is his top priority, proving so by paying tribute to his grandfather by taking ""Rawhead Bloodybones"" out of the hayride because his grandfather portrayed him. This is director/producer/screenwriter Terron R. Parsons' first full-length film and the sequel is his second. While this film gets generally favorable reviews, the sequel doesn't fare too well because too much footage from this film is cribbed. You can tell most of the actors are local, because they have that Alabama twang which just sounds like poetry to people like myself and makes the film more realistic. Besides the awful flashback technique used to tell Pitchfork's origin, the technical aspects are good. So just put your brain in neutral and go along for the bloody hayride. Oh yes, there will be blood! Also starring Josh Nelson, Jessica Blevins, Mitch Bryars Jr., Dustin Hicks, Brandon Wright, Tiffany Parsons Rezner, Pam Kelly, Christopher Howell and Armand J.

Needless to say, this is not a pretty picture. What is it about all these back roads where bad things happen; there are always damn cornfields and bad things lurking around inside of them. Scarecrows aren't exactly high on my list of my favorite things either.

I suppose I'll get over it in time as I did my other horror movie phobias........maybe.

The actor who delighted us around the campfire with the monologue about the murderous farmer was brilliant.
A really excellent monologue is not easy to pull off and his telling of the story was wonderful, it pulled you right in and made you want more.

The premise and setting of the story was also well conceived.
The acting is a little spotty at times but the film is no basically no nonsense, to the point, very human and very entertaining.

5564509,1,B00B9JKREK,"I give it one star because of bad writing, some horrendous acting, and horrid production. The ADR is bad, shots are bad, editing was bad, and the story made me want to punch myself in the mouth until my teeth fell out. Skip this movie, unless thats what you wanted to see, which was why I watched it.
The plot is dull, doesn't like to explain itself, but its enjoyable to watch with some film snobs so you can all tear it apart.",1402185600,,428,4.168674698795181

5564518,1,B00B9JKREK,"This was a poorly done movie. Not just due to the low budget and bad acting, that can sometimes be overlooked, but the glaring editing errors made it unwatchable.  In one scene a character is brutally bludgeoned to death. When the sledge hammer is raise up, there is barely a speck of blood on it after cruyshing someones skull. I don't need bloody gore in  a movie and believ that less is more in horror, but this seemed strange.

In other scenes things change from frame to frame. The worst was the long, boring dialogue. This is a problem with many scripts written by inexperienced writers. Rather than show you, they tell you. The result is a long monologue that seems unnatural and a lot of filler that does nothing to move the story forward.

We don't get to see the back story being played out fully, Instead we get to hear various people tell the story of pitchfork man while actors play out the scene in cut off frames. Its difficult to describe how terrible it is to watch the killer in flashback with most of his body and most of his actions cut out of the frame (done with an annoying grainy texture and strange underlying crackling noise) while a voice over tells you what is happening.
Its just not worth watching.  When the final reveal comes and we see who the killer really is, it makes no sense. Its as though the writer ran out of story and just threw something in.",1388620800,,1384,4.411764705882353

This was beyond low budget- cars would drive by on screen at 5-6 mph (trying to fool people that they are going 40-50 mph) character interaction was clearly forced, the lines were laughable, and the plot was terrible. this movie isn't worth watching, i didn't get 45 mins into it before I couldn't put up with it anymore...",1387238400,,471,4.7439024390243905

5564525,4,B00B9JKREK,"Two events collide in HAYRIDE to create the backbone of the story. Event #1- A behemoth-sized,  mass-murdering maniac named Duncan is captured, escapes custody, kills his police escorts, and goes on a fresh killing spree. Event #2-  An annual Halloween hayride takes place nearby. On the night before the festivities, the hayride's creators have gathered around the fire, telling tales of ""Pitchfork"", a crazed, homicidal farmer out to punish everyone for his daughter's disappearance. Finally, the big night arrives. The real, gooshy fun begins when Duncan shows up, and starts dispatching unwary victims one by one.  But wait, how can we be sure that it's Duncan and not the legendary Pitchfork? HAYRIDE is an ultra-low-budget film that makes the best of its limited resources. Are there clunky spots? Yes. Is there a bit of cheeeze? Sure, but overall it's an effective Halloween retro-slasher. This movie even contains some character development! Now, THAT'S scary!...",1381708800,3,971,5.333333333333333

5564527,2,B00B9JKREK,The acting is awful - very stiff and forced.  The premise is fantastic for a slasher flick but it is very slow to get started.

5564529,3,B00B9JKREK,Hayride is your classic Halloween movie. You are drawn in by the first few scenes but it gets a little slow. But once Pitchfork appears the movie takes off. It gets a bit predictable for adults but the younger crowd will love it. There is some gore but everyone from age 12 up should be fine with it. It will keep most audiences jumping. We watched it with the lights all off and had a great time. I'd include it in a Halloween film fest or movie night.,1380844800,2,453,4.159090909090909

5564533,1,B00B9JKREK,Worst acting and may be in fact the worst movie I have ever seen. I have students doing non class video projects that are much better than this.

5564535,3,B00B9JKREK,"This movie weaves a local culture into the ""rural legend"" realm, and recalls the ghost and campfire story aesthetic of predecessor films like ""Friday the 13th,"" while attempting to tap some of the savagery of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  It misses the mark a few times, going off on some tangents, but still manages to deliver a visceral fear that belongs within the setting in which the story takes place, a concept often lost in films of lesser caliber.",1376352000,,458,4.7974683544303796

8564648,4,B00B9JKREK,"This movie showcases some great charm and has some likable and at times funny characters.  Among them are Steven, his hot girlfriend Amanda, Steven's cousin Corey, and Steven's beloved uncle Morgan aka Captain Morgan.  Not to be confused with the spiced rum pirate.

Steven comes to his old farmhouse in Alabama with Amanda to help out his cousin Corey and his uncle Morgan(as well as the other people working at it) with their traditional family scary haunted hayride for Halloween.  In the meantime as theirs always been their little campfire tale of a local farmer that went on a killing spree simply referred to as Pitchfork; as that was his preferred weapon of choice.  As they prepare for the festivities, a big/menacing local serial killer successfully escapes police captivity and is heading their way.

While this movie isn't perfect, as I said the characters are interesting, likable, and charming.  The whole deal with the killer killing unsuspecting people while they partake in the hayride and new haunted house not only proved a different idea, but it worked pretty well.  I will admit that a bit more gore would've been welcomed but given the unique environment with the isolation of a small town in Alabama, the lovely cinematography, the hayride and their new haunted house, the intensity of the killer, the occasionally funny cops on the case, and just how this guy has a huge arsenal of weapons that he never runs out of, this movie actually proves entertaining.  My only criticism about this movie is the shaky and at times off center camera work.  PS Hayride 2 however should be totally avoided like the plague it is.",1476662400,,1638,4.88086642599278
