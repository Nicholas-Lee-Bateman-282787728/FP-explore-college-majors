This DVD transfer even comes with a complementary VHS tracking line throughout the entire movie.  It has a message that the picture ""has been modified to fit your screen"" WTF? It was modified to fit the VHS tape from which this crap DVD was ripped.

I do not know what the Westlake release is like but recommend buying over the Visionary Release.",1469232000,,478,4.746987951807229
8078333,1,B000AEZU0G,"I didn't buy this movie from Amazon, like I should have. Had I, I would have gotten a fairly good deal on the VHS, (0.28!) but then again, I would have missed out on Pizza Man, and I need that movie in my collection. Well, whatever, you make mistakes...Back to the movie...

  I bought this thinking that it might be good. It was a part of a double Movie set, and I didn't want to miss out on ""Pizza Man"", so I purchased this mess at National Wholesale Liquidators for 4.99. The audio in this movie is AWFUL, I truly mean it, I could barely hear or understand a word on my T.V. set, so I watched it in my computer instead. It opens in an office, with a young woman talking about her problems to her psychiatrist, and she opens up about her sexual abuse when she was younger. This is to sort of give a background as to why later on she will lash out on men that get near her. She get's diagnosed as ""dangerous"", and must be kept away from men at all times.

Okay...Are you lost? It's okay, I think everyone else is, too...

We then get introduced to some kid who would later on be her love interest. He's the typical, cocky, ego-centrical jerk, who has flings with all types of girls and then leaves them. however, when he meets Krystal, all of that is about to change. This movie drags ALOT, and not much builds up. The ending is a bit absurd, and the acting is completely overdone. If you have seen ""The Guy from Harlem"", you know what to expect here. However, ""The Guy from Harlem"" tried damn hard, and held your interest well. This movie bored me to tears. The acting is somewhat okay, I notice that scenes that require more emotions the actors tend to fall flat, such as the ending. However, the earlier scenes, such as when the characters are talking, have too much dialogue and not enough actions, and the actors don't display enough talent, (that is, if they have any) but alot of B Films tend to suffer from these type of scenes. Overall, I highly suggest passing this movie. It's not worth it, and you'll just kick yourself for not only wasting money on it, but for wasting your life on it too...",1146268800,,2105,4.292191435768262
