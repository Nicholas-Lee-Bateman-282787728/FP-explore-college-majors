2607283,5,B000GFLKEE,"OMG, what can I say?!
This movie is soooo good.  My daughter and I watched it together, laughed and cried together, and I got my husband to watch it and HE cried, too!  It is such a heartwarming movie that is good for the whole family.  I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of if you have children or not.  It's the story of 2 orphaned girls who find a puppy.  They end up getting adopted, but their new home has a ""No Dogs Allowed"" policy.  What they end up doing to keep this puppy as their own is for you to watch--I will not spoil it.  It is an extremely good movie that will pull at your heartstrings.  WE LOVED IT!!!",1195948800,,639,4.138211382113822
2607284,5,B000GFLKEE,"After coming across this DVD by complete accident at my local library, I must admit that for me, a prominent draw to the film was the fact that ""Starring Abigail Breslin, Star of Little Miss Sunshine"" was written across the front of the box. Surely, this little advertisement is understandable, given young Breslin's recent Oscar nomination and steadily rising status as a consistent child actress.

With two adorable little girls and a charming puppy adorning the cover of the DVD, it already indicates that genre that many of us love, especially in today's world--87 minutes of purely bright, fluffy entertainment that can be enjoyed by children, teenagers, college kids, adults, and basically just about anyone who likes this kind of thing. If ""Chestnut"" is your type of movie, you know exactly who you are, and after all, nothing hits home quite like a story with cute kids and lovable family pets.

Ideal for reeling in even the youngest of children, the plot of is simple: orphaned sisters Sal and Rae (approximately 6 and 8 years old, respectively) come across an abandoned Great Dane puppy, take deliberate measures to hide it from the orphanage staff, and encounter an even messier predicament when they are adopted by a young married couple from Manhattan. Finding a permanent home with one another is a dream come true for these tight-knit siblings, but once they arrive at their dog-free apartment building, they must rely on all their resources to keep Chestnut away from their adoptive parents (one of whom is severely allergic to dogs), their fellow residents, and a very crabby apartment director.

Winner of the Heartland Crystal Heart Award--an honor that praises the film's positive message and appropriate quality for all ages--""Chestnut"" is, plain and simple, a lot of fun and easy to love as you begin watching it. The story has the perfect mix of humor and poignancy, making you laugh out loud at some points (watch for a great improvisational scene where Sal and Rae, dripping in fancy jewelry and irresistable side ponytails, jam to the catchy song ""That's What Girls Do"") yet also depicting some raw, authentic human bonds that are a pleasant asset to the story. Some other reviewers here have commented about questionable scenes with the robbers who target the girls' apartment building, along with some saddening scenes near the end of the film. While an certain accident involving Chestnut might be VERY mildly frightening to some more sensitive children, it's not anything inappropriately graphic, and it's pretty unlikely that kids will lose sleep over it when they watch it. The overall tone is heartwarming and innocent, so it is reasonable for parents to perceive the movie as such.

Although I've already mentioned her in this review, I have to emphasize again that Abigail Breslin is quite an impressive little actress and does a nice job playing Rae. Sweet, adorable, and impeccably gifted at emoting in front of the camera, she is a complete joy to watch and, while immensely talented and natural, is not so overexploited as other starlets her age who shall remain nameless. Makenzie Vega--who recently appeared as Meg Ryan's daughter in 2007's ""In the Land of Women"" and is the younger sister of actress Alexa Vega--is equally solid and likable as young Sal, serving as a loving and protective big sis to Rae as she does her best to keep everything in order. Breslin and Vega work very well together, creating a convincing formula as onscreen siblings and endearingly mischievous little girls. If there's only one thing I can say to prove that these kids have promising acting careers ahead, it's the fact that they were both required to cry for practically half of the movie's duration, and they were so incredibly competent at getting in character, the camera was able to zoom right in their faces and pronounce those emotions in a truly believable way. I don't know how they got those kids to sob so effortlessly in scene after scene, but it's some pretty good stuff, and it's sure to make your heart break.

Also appealing in this film is the wholly positive example that is set by the adults in the plot. We've all seen those children's movies about the cold orphanages and the cruel people who run them, but that is absolutely not the case at the institution where Sal and Rae live at the beginning of the story. Organized by a group of Catholic nuns (another character stereotype that many filmmakers have a field day with), this orphanage is warm and inviting, the children are treated well, and for once, you can sit back and enjoy a movie that values portraying these things in a nicer light. Of course, what's even more beautiful is what we discover with Sal and Rae's adoptive parents. With the real-world problems that exist with some marriages and orphaned children, isn't it refreshing to watch a genuinely loving husband and wife who are willing to not only give a couple orphans a stable home, but are also amenable to taking in older kids? Hopefully, we will continue to see more people like this in real life--people who eagerly create their own family dynamics, practice attentive and hands-on parenting, and give children a safe, trusting environment to grow up in.

With that being said, this isn't a DVD title that too many people know about, since it did not appear in theaters or receive wider advertisement, but if you happen to see it in a store or as a video rental, I'd recommend that you give it a shot. Unfortunately, there aren't many movies with the same pure quality as this. I guess ""cute"" and ""charming"" are the best words I can come up with right now, but hey, those simple words tend to be the mark of something that's actually worth your time, so if you are lucky enough to catch it, get the family together and enjoy a heartfelt story with plenty of youthful spirit and energy to go around! :)",1189123200,28,5872,4.8262164846077455
2607285,5,B000GFLKEE,"My 4 year old has watched this movie 3 times in less than 24 hours, she is completely captivated by the story.  The tone of this movie is a little more somber than many modern family flicks but it was actually a nice break from our usual selections.  I would suggest watching it alongside your child(ren) the first time through--my daughter was a little teary through some of the scenes.",1187913600,,387,4.514285714285714
2607286,3,B000GFLKEE,"I rented this movie to watch with my 5 yr old grandaughter who just got her first puppy a few months ago.  I thought there was a very wrong message sent in the beginning of the movie when the young girl ran out in traffic to save the dog. Then at the end of the movie, I thought it was totally unnecessary to the plot and too tramatic for a younger child to have to see Chestnut stabbed by the robbers and then bleeding profusely. Come on, movie-makers, you shouldn't have done that.",1183334400,4,483,4.193548387096774
2607287,5,B000GFLKEE,"We rented this movie first as a fluke and my 8 yr old ended up watching it 4 times over that 2 day period.  She said it was her all time favorite movie so  I went ahead and bought it for her.  She watches it over and over.  It is a sweet, heart-warming story with no foul language or inappropriateness at all.  The mother is a wonderful example of a loving, understanding mom and the girls are just super sweet.  We have an adopted daughter so if you are concerned about the orphan theme, you needn't be; we were very pleased with it's upbeat take on adoption.  Would heartily recommend for any family!",1171843200,,602,4.274336283185841
2607288,5,B000GFLKEE,This movie was a real surprise for me.  My daughter picked it out at the video store and I had never even heard of it.  We took a chance and we loved the movie.  It is a very heart warming story.  There are a couple of very tear jerking moments.  My eight year old daughter absolutely loved it.  She can't stop talking about it.  It was very moving for her. I highly recommend it for any household with girls.,1168041600,,409,4.10126582278481
2607289,4,B000GFLKEE,"If you have a little girl around the house this is a great movie to watch. Two orphaned sisters are adopted by a childless NYC couple and move from their rural orphanage to an affluent high-rise overlooking Central Park. The plot thickens with their smuggling their Great Dane puppy in with them. As the puppy grows, so do their problems. Cynical adults will have a lot of problems with the plausibility of all this, but a little suspension of disbelief with go a long way toward making this an enjoyable movie.

The movie's best feature are the two sisters played by Makenzie Vega {younger sister of Alexa of ""Spy Kids"" fame} and Abigail Breslin, now famous for ""Little Miss Sunshine"". The two girls really carry the movie.

A lot of light-hearted family fun.

2607290,5,B000GFLKEE,"This is a very heart-warming story that my nieces and I really enjoyed.  I had never heard of this movie until Dec 18th when my nieces saw it previewed on TV.  It hasn't received much publicity which surprises me.  The story line was predictable to me but still very enjoyable.  The two sisters are orphaned, spend time in an orphanage, then adopted.  But this part of the story is shown in a way that is not upsetting to my nieces (ages 4 and 6.)  They watched it over and over. It held their attention - it did not have any boring parts.  Really fast-paced and cute.  I would recommend this for all young girls!",1167523200,6,613,4.315789473684211

2607406,5,B000GFLKEE,This was a cute movie. My five year old loved it. A little tearful in some parts .It still ended well though. The two little girls were very good actors in this movie and very relatable. I give it five stars because my daughter loved it so much.

2607473,5,B000GFLKEE,Love this movie.  One of the best ever.  Like where the little girls rescue the little dog and where they have to keep sneaking it in and out of both the foster home and their new parents apartment.  Also love the ending where they finally allow pets to stay in the apartments after Chestnut catches the robbers. Very good movie for the whole family.,1438992000,,350,4.4375

2607531,4,B000GFLKEE,The story was cute especially the two sisters who hide the dog from their new adopted parents for so long.  It is more of a younger persons movie but I still enjoyed it.

2607534,4,B000GFLKEE,"I'm very picky about the types of movies that my boys ages 5 and 8 watch.  I typically avoid anything with bathroom humor or cursing of any kind.  This movie was one of the most appropriate movies I've seen recently for young kids.  Other than the fact that the girls are being deceptive by hiding the dog from their adoptive parents and taking the blame for the dog's messes to keep their secret safe, the lessons learned in this movie are pretty positive.  The humor is a little unbelievable, but my boys laughed so hard that it didn't bother them that adults can't really swing from a ceiling fan, etc.  There were two fairly brief scenes where alcohol was involved.  In one the adoptive mom is toasting wine with her friends at work over the upcoming adoption, and in another there is a wedding reception where guests are seen drinking from cocktail glasses, although all eyes are really on the dog who is crashing the party.  I appreciated that there weren't any immodestly dressed people in the movie and no swearing.  There is one comment about ""a place to poop"" but it is when the girls move to their new high rise NYC apartment and the adoptive mom shows them the balcony connected to their room, and the little sister points out excitedly that there is a place for the dog to go.  So, it's not the typical potty talk and crude humor in most kids movies. All in all it's a winner.",1400112000,2,1389,4.458498023715415

And I'm so glad that I did!  The acting is great (Abigail Breslin - love her!!!), the script is cute and believable, and could Chestnut be any cuter?

2607554,3,B000GFLKEE,"CHESTNUT is one of those you-can't-help-but-like family movies featuring adorable kids and an equally adorable dog.  To the film's credit, a positive spin is given to adoption and to adoptive parents, thus avoiding the usual cliches.  The use of a Great Dane as the titular hero also allows a wider assortment of crises.
Future Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin and Makenzie Vaga are charming and Justin Louis and Christina Tucci do nicely as the girls' new parents.
CHESTNUT is certainly a good family film and one adults should be able to tolerate.",1357776000,,546,4.989010989010989

2607562,4,B000GFLKEE,"This is a good clean movie that you won't be embarrassed to share with the family come movie night.  There are no surprise situations that will catch you off guard and leaping for the remote to fast forward through.  This is actually one movie that you won't find any arguing of any kind, and only a small amount of slapstick humor and violence, if you can even call it that. Surprisingly it has a lot of actors/actresses that we have seen before, the big name being Abigail Breslin who is so young you almost don't even recognize her!

The movie is about two orphan sisters who live together at the Catholic orphanage.  The younger sister, Rae, constantly asks her older sister, Sal, questions about everything and wants to sleep with her every night because she is afraid of the dark.  All throughout the movie Sal shows a huge amount of patience with Rae and replies with love and kindness at all times.  Never once does Sal raise her voice or make Rae feel like she is being a pest or bothersome or that her questions are dumb.  Sal is always caring for Rae.  This also goes for many other characters in the movie: the nuns, the other children at the orphanage, the adoptive parents, they all only show kindness and patience.  Even when at times (the girls hiding a dog in the house, Sal running away, ruining the fathers architecture work, unraveling the mother's knitting, etc.) most would not have patience at all, they never raise their voice or get angry.  So in that aspect it is far from reality, as is a lot of other things written into this movie.  But I compare it to the type of far out writing of ""Home Alone"".  There are situations you would hope a child would never be placed (running in front of a rig to save a dog, running away from home to central park in the middle of the night, etc.) The bumbling burglars breaking into apartments, crashing a wedding, and planning their next robbery is just as outlandish.  There are silly references to ""poop"", which they say/use over and over again, gets old very fast.  The adoptive parents also hire a nanny who does not speak English, bringing some stereotypical casting into play.  The movie does hint a few times on the death of the girls mother and how they never had a dad before.  Rae also will only wear golashes because that is the only thing Rae remembers from a picture showing that her mother wore golashes.

This is a nice little movie that families can enjoy together.  The movie moves fast and gets quickly to the plot. There is no yelling or arguing and that is a refreshing change from movies for children these days.

As far as the reference others have made about the dog getting stabbed in the end, it is really not that bad.  I almost did not let my child watch this movie because of it and that would have been a shame.  I can honestly tell you it was not bad at all.  The scene shows the dog staring at the burglar.  The burglar grabs a letter opener. The dog jumps on the burglar.  The dog is shown laying on the floor with a hint of blood running down his armpit.  The way I saw it, the dog jumped on the burglar and happened to land on the letter opener.  He did not get stabbed, or at least there is nothing to lead you to believe that.  They never show the burglar stabbing the dog or even making an attempt to stab the dog.  I think this whole scene has been blown out of proportion by a few reviewers.

The movie was also not that big of a tear jerker.  It was really light hearted with a lot of heart at the same time.  Sure there were some sentimental scenes that may tug at your heart, but a box of Kleenex is sort of going overboard.  In the end, it is just a good wholesome movie for those families that are trying to keep the unnecessary violence, arguing and language away from their young impressionable children.  For that I commend them, keep up the good work!",1307923200,2,3862,4.364145658263305

2607572,5,B000GFLKEE,"I generally find kid/animal films, especially the early Disney ones, to be a bit too slick, self-consciously attempting to elict planned responses from the viewers.

But not this one.  The delightful girls are allowed to act quite naturally, without trying to be ""cute"" and hamming it up.  If anything, they underact, which is refreshing.  They don't mind in the least being upstaged by a great dane (one a puppy, one halfway grown, and the third, fully grown and powerful). In fact, they obviously have a lot of fun with this charmer (all three sizes).

Much of the credit goes to the director of the film, Robert Vince, who seems to hava an instinctive knack of working with children and animals together.  He has quite a background as a film producer, i.e., Space Buddies, Snow Buddies, etc., which has stood him well in this very successfu directorial effort.

There are lots of ingredients in this film:  a rural Catholic girls' orphanage, an urbane Central Park East setting, we even get to take a trip to the top of the Statue of Liberty, and many beautiful walks through Central Park.  The cinematography by Arthur E. Cooper is admirable, he is really a master at capturing the vividness of color.  New York City never looked so beautiful.

The Problem:  the girls find and love a puppy, get adopted by a New York couple and sneak the puppy into their private quarters on Central Park East.  But puppy doesn't stay a puppy.  Also, we've got a couple of bad guys running around the neighborhood--cat burglers, at that--and without giving too much away, all works out as it should, and even the Scrooge-like owner of swanky NYC apartment buildings (Barry Bostwick at his very best) finds out he's got a heart, as well as a cash register, in his nature.

One watches a completely innovative creative idea come to life in, of all things, the closing credits of the film.  This is usually a time for the viewer to start doing other things or begin to leave the theater.  But not so here, because on the upper quarter of the screen, both visual and audio footage is shown of the rehearsals for the film.  Some of it is just as hilarious as the comedy in the movie itself.

Get ready to laugh a lot, but keep your hanky nearby.  This film offers a real good time.  They are so rare nowadays.",1270425600,2,2292,4.596059113300493
