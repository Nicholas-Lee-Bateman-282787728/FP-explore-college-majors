2958445,5,B000VXWY4Q,"If you've read Bram Stoker or seen any standard version of Dracula, you'll figure it out even with no knowledge of French.  Sit back and enjoy!  The singing and staging are outstanding and worthy of the phenomenal score.  The ""tango"" with Mina and Dracula is one of the most sensuous pieces of choreography in the last decade.

Hopefully, some insightful producer will invest in an English version for the US and others who would prefer a piece in that language.  Meanwhile, have fun with the original.........",1217980800,7,510,4.883720930232558
2958446,5,B000VXWY4Q,"I have not yet gotten the DVD (which is to become available in January or February 2008), but I have seen the musical 23 times.

I love the music composed by Roger Tabra (lyrics) and Simon Leclerc (music). The performers and their performances are all wonderful! Admittedly, I am a huge Bruno Pelletier fan and he was my initial draw to the project, but have since appreciated the others in the cast as well.

Bruno IS Dracula and his incandescent performance is a thing of beauty. His voice is strong. Sylvain Cossette as Jonathan Harker has one of the most haunting pieces to sing in ""Mina"". Andree Watters as Mina makes a splendid debut. The other novice is Daniel Boucher as Renfield and definitely a star is born in his case. The cast is rounded out by veterans Pierre Flynn (a fantastic Van Helsing), Gabrielle Destroismaisons (Lucy), Louis Gagne (Grand Lui - the narrator), Elyzabeth Diaga, Brigitte Marchand and Rita Tabbakh (the three vampiresses), background singers Claude Pineault, Julie Dassylva and Martin Giroux. In addition two musicians play live: Dan Mongrain (guitar) and Jean-Francois Groulx (keyboards).

I'm definitely looking forward to adding this DVD to my collection to enjoy for years to come!

Addition:

Now that the DVD has been released and I have obtained mine, I can tell you it is simply breathtaking! As the musical is soon to embark on a tour of Asia and Europe, it is a special treat to have it preserved with its splendid original cast.

(One minor note: Despite what this listing says, there aren't any subtitles, but that should not lessen anyone's enjoyment of this incredible spectacular.)

Dracula Entre l'amour et la mort is very much still a ""work in progress"". It has changed quite a bit from its debut in Montreal at the St-Denis January 31, 2006. Songs and dialogue have been changed, deleted, added, and moved around. The show that was seen in Lyon, France this year was a little different still. For instance, the setting for the song ""Entre l'amour et la mort"" is totally different on the DVD than it was originally, and the song ""Urgence"" has been moved from the first act to the second, replacing ""Rester debout"" (also sung by Andree Watters).

I love all incarnations of the show, and I watch the DVD incessantly! I hope someday the United States will get with the program and bring the show here in its English form. That would be waaaay cool!",1212796800,10,2405,4.775903614457832
2958447,5,B000VXWY4Q,"This is an amazing dvd. The quality of the music, the commanding performances, both vocally and dramatically, are superior to anything I've seen for a very long time, if ever.  I am especially delighted that it is a production entirely qubcois.  What a marvelous testament to the great talent to be found in ""La belle province!""  The sets and special effects are very creative as are the new twists on the story.
Although I speak almost no French, the fact that there are no subtitles does not diminish my enjoyment.
Bruno Pelletier's highly original portrayal of Dracula is truly masterful and he achieves the impossible: as vile and cruel as his character is, he is able to convey his tortured soul and evoke sympathy in the listener.  I found ""Le Temple de Satan"" especially heart-wrenching, as well as one of the most exquisite songs.  The entire cast performs admirably and the haunting music by Simon Leclerc is stunningly beautiful.  This great musical deserves worldwide exposure!",1205366400,5,988,4.957575757575758

8220504,3,B000VXWY4Q,I did not know there is no subtitles. So I really like the songs and performs but I can't understand the story and songs.... It would be better if it has notice about no subtitle... It's quite shock it has no captions at all even english... But the delivery is good and state is good.,1466294400,,284,4.181818181818182
8220505,4,B000VXWY4Q,Beautiful music.  Too bad it is not in English.  But well done.,1457136000,,63,4.166666666666667
8220506,5,B000VXWY4Q,This is a wonderful musical especially Bruno Pelletier's performance is breathtaking. I wish it had english subtitles. The song mysterieux personnage is great.,1369094400,,159,5.956521739130435
8220507,5,B000VXWY4Q,"If you like French musicals, you will enjoy this show. Great performers and strong voices. Bruno Pellitier and Rita Tabbakh-to name few. My favorite part is the tango with Dracula.",1342915200,,180,5.033333333333333
8220508,4,B000VXWY4Q,"I think the play it is okay, music was about the same, not so dramatic as Don Juan which one of the best. The love of dracula for girl and the other guy in between, but at the end dracula let her go. I wanted more in sense of drama and music and perhaps the plot. I can't wait for the new Dracula on dvd in United State available for us. I gave 4 rating, because is not too bad, but for my taste I want more.",1342656000,,408,3.7011494252873565
8220509,2,B000VXWY4Q,I was really looking forward to watching this DVD since I am a big fan of the the Notre Dame production with Bruno Pelletier. But there are NO sub-titles on this DVD. I wish this was made more clear before I ordered it.,1338768000,2,219,4.116279069767442
8220510,5,B000VXWY4Q,"I know about three words of French.  So the lack of subtitles was a real problem.  I was totally confused the first half of the show.  And the 'look' of the show <urban grunge> threw me off.  In short, I hated the first half of the show.

But then it started to grow on me.  Parts of the story still left me confused, but I let myself relax and just enjoy the music and scenery.

If someone asked me my opinion, I'd say ""It's...interesting"" and leave it at that.  But I'm glad I saw it.  And I suspect I will watch it again and enjoy it more.

Edited to add...

I've now had the chance to watch this again and revised my rating from four stars to five.

This is really an amazing version of Dracula.  Though there were still a couple of places where I'm a bit confused as to exactly what's going on, I found that it made a lot more sense the second time through.  And the *look* of it has grown on me (though I still prefer my Draculas with a long, black cape <grin>)

Most importantly, I can now better appreciate the singing and the acting.  Though everyone was good, the man who played Dracula stole the show.  Even though I couldn't understand what he was saying, I could tell how he was feeling by his acting and the emotion in his voice.  A superb performance.

I would strongly urge any Dracula fan to give this a chance.  I think you'll enjoy it.",1320451200,2,1354,4.174418604651163
8220511,2,B000VXWY4Q,"I bought the DVD because of Bruno Pelletier and his talent. I am a French teacher and was interested in showing the musical to my students.  Unfortunately, the music overpowers the singing. Sometimes,you can't even hear at all the singers. I think the sound quality of the recording is horrendous. I am French and I had real difficulties to understand what was being said and though understanding the plot. I would not buy this DVD. It's a shame because the setting is beautiful, the singing is good (from what I can hear) and the music is quite cool (it has a rock feel to it).",1308182400,4,578,4.504761904761905
8220512,5,B000VXWY4Q,"I got to watch a friend's copy a few weeks ago, and I love this production. The album, which I got maybe a year ago, gave me a good taste but did not prepare me for the awesomeness of actually seeing it performed. I've been a fan of Bruno Pelletier since seeing/hearing him as Gringoire in Notre-Dame de Paris, and his performance as Dracula does not disappoint. The whole cast is excellent, the actor portraying Grand-Lui has the perfect voice for that character, and the man they have playing guitar onstage is a rock deity. The creative use of a digital mini-cam and two video screens integrated in the set also enhance the production and, for me at least, make up for the lack of subtitles. I finally got to purchase my own copy, and it will become a much-loved part of my personal library. J'adore les musicales francophones!",1260489600,4,830,4.577181208053691
8220513,5,B000VXWY4Q,"This is a fantastic musical and even though it's in French with no subtitles.  However, if you are familiar with the Dracula story you should be able to follow along even if you don't know any French.

Bruno Pelletier - who played Gringoire from the musical Notre Dame de Paris, another musical favorite of mine - does a fantastic job as Dracula and one of the main reasons I decided to purchase this DVD.  Even without knowing the language, he made me feel for Dracula in a way I never had before.  The rest of the cast also give awesome performances and there are quite a few that I will want to follow career-wise from now on.",1232928000,3,629,4.35042735042735
