It IS entertaining in a bizarre kind of way. Anything with Uschi Digard deserves a look, and there are a couple of other attractive women here. None of them gets naked all that much, even though the plot involves a prostitution operation aimed at truckers. No full nudity at all, which is disappointing.

More disappointing is the transfer (really, really, REALLY bad in places--there's a scene near the end that's so dark that you seriously can't make out any shapes--just one very small swash of red--for close to 30 seconds). I understand that this is taken from the best source material available. Just get ready to be annoyed at least a little by the reality of that.

The part of this that's actually entertaining is the ineptness of the filmmakers and the willingness to cut pretty much every corner to get this film released. It's right up there with some of the worst movies I've ever seen from that standpoint. I had trouble figuring out what was going on through much of it, despite a fairly noble effort by the lead actors. The cinematography is awful (poor cropping, out-of-focus shots, bad lighting); the audio is atrocious (ADR that sounds like it was recorded in a cement basement); the editing is non-existent (dropped or flubbed lines seemed to be no big deal). But the biggest head-scratcher of all is that from all that I can figure out, a fairly  significant plot point was rewritten after being shot, yet both scenes still remain in the film making the final product a totally nonsensical wreck.",1419724800,,1619,4.690140845070423
