7856559,5,6303953646,"This video is clearly geared for children...and fire engine enthusiasts! I would rate it ""middle of the road"": child-friendly/orientated, not scary, maybe even a bit simplistic? ...but excellent for 5-7 yr. old youngsters. We got a kick out of the NY accent. :)",1461196800,,261,5.093023255813954
7856560,5,6303953646,"My son received this video from his Grandmother.  What can I say?  It's a hit!  It's a non-fiction account of what actually goes on in a fire station, the difference between the types of fire trucks and rescue equipment, how the hoses work for large and small buildings, etc.  In addition, it's well-written and down to earth without being insulting or downplaying the intellegence of an average kid interested in the subject.  In fact, our whole family (Grandma included!) learned a lot from this short film.  About 30 minutes long, and very, very good.",984009600,7,554,4.840425531914893
