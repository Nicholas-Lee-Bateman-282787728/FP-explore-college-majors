8394038,5,B003BWQDQY,"I watched a portion of this series on Canadian TV recently during a trip to Montreal and am looking forward to seeing how everything ends (I never read the prize-winning book) when I get the DVD. From the first-half I watched, this is an extremely well-made film, with terrific acting and a quite interesting story. Lead actor David Julian Hirsch may well remind you of Hugh Grant. I always enjoy watching Elliot Gould's performances and Andrew Martin (whom I fondly remember from SCTV) fits her part very well, too.",1275350400,2,516,4.808988764044944
