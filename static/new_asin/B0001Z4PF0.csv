8018599,3,B0001Z4PF0,"I noticed the high price on this item and thought I should let people know that they can get it for far less. And here on Amazon! It's on the ""Western TV Heroes"" DVD set. I've seen it for less, but you can get it on Amazon for about $20. Plus, there are 299 other TV westerns included!

Seems like a no-brainer to me. Instead of 26 minutes for over $40, you get 132 hours for about half that.

The film itself is pretty bad. It seems to be a quickly thrown together TV showcase for Johnny Cash. However, the music is worth putting up with the poor script and horrible acting. Plus, Dickie Jones plays an unlikable character, far removed from his youthful sidekick to Range Rider or cheerful Pinochio. And there's Eddie Dean, a little past his prime, and the great Merle Travis. And, of course, Mr. Cash.

So, it's worth a look. Just don't over-spend.",1410134400,,850,4.367088607594937
