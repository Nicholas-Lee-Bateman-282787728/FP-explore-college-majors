Monty Walsh has got to be one of my favorite westerns of all time. Tom Sellecks humor, and his honest portrayals of western men is just wonderful. He is a classic, and so is this collection.

3104105,4,B0013D8M44,"Yes, I'm not a huge western fan.  I was burnt out by my dad's rabid taste for the old B&W serial westerns of the 30s, 40s and 50s.  Same tired stories and lame acting over, and over, and over again. But that's not to say I don't appreciate a well done movie, whatever the genre.  This is one.  I bought this for mom, who loves all things Selleck, as part of the Tom Selleck Western Collection.  I thought I'd seen this as well as the other two films (Monte Walsh, Crossfire Trail).  I was mistaken about this one. It was a pleasure to see the Carradine brothers together and a very young Haley Joel Osment as Selleck's (Paul Cable's) son.  Suzy Amis is excellent in her role as the take-no-guff frontier wife who feels her marriage may be over due to the changes the civil war has bestowed on her husband's psyche. He is disillusioned by the atrocities of war he witnessed and deeply saddened to learn of the loss of his youngest daughter during his absence. I won't go into further detail as it's been done exceedingly well by others here.  Suffices to say the writing, acting and all other aspects of this movie are very well executed. I would recommend this movie and the Tom Selleck Western Collection to those who consider themselves fans of fine movies.

PS: I only gave this 4.5 stars not to dis' this excellent movie, but to note that there are better westerns IMHO. True Grit, The Shootist, Open Range, Sons of Katie Elder, Shenandoah (always makes me cry) are all as good or better in some cases.",1216684800,16,1506,4.447272727272727
3104106,5,B0013D8M44,"Last Stand At Saber River is one of my favorite roles that Tom Selleck plays.  The man not only knows sacrifice but he shows it also.  Crossfire trail has my favorite script and is my favorite western ever made.

Tom and Sam are true cowboys to the bone and I am so thankfull to Universal studios for the chance they were given.  To think that Tom gave up ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" to honor the contract that he was under tells you a lot about the character of the man.",1216598400,5,469,4.1208791208791204
3104107,5,B0013D8M44,"I grew up at a time when westerns dominated television and John Wayne was the world's #1 movie star so it was inevitable that westerns would become my favorite film genre.

And then suddenly, westerns just seemed to drop off the face of the earth and with the exception of the occasional film - Unforgiven / Dances With Wolves and a few others, this genre was verging on extinction.

But thank goodness for people like Clint (in his earlier years), Sam Elliot and Tom Selleck, who have done their very best to keep the western alive.

This collection of Tom Selleck's TNT / made-for-television films is a wonderful addition to anybody's collection of great western films. Tom is a very believable and credible cowboy, who epitomizes the code that many western men of the late 19th century lived by - honor/ integrity.

We, of course, had our first glimpse of Tom as a western star in some of his earlier films - The Sacketts / The Shadow Riders / Quigley Down Under and he continues to maintain the level of excellence he established with Monte Walsh / Crossfire Tail and Last Stand At Sabre River.

I think what sets these types of films apart is that they have little choice but to stand on nothing more than compelling stories and solid performances. Unlike so many of the movies that are so popular today, these films don't rely on incredible special effects or computer generated images to hold our attention. The story and character development is the primary appeal of these films.

Monte Walsh is a tough act to follow as it's a remake of the classic western film that starred Lee Marvin and the incomparable Jack Palance as two aging cowboys who have to deal with the fact that the west of their youth is changing and the 20th centruy is looming very large.

Tom as Monte and David Carridine as his life long pal, Chet, are more than up for the challenge.

It's a wonderful story with great performances by the two stars and supporting cast.

Crossfire Trial is an adaptation of a great Louis L'Amour book and deals with a common theme in westerns - the good guy dealing with seemingly insurmoutable odds to fend off an ambitious and ruthless antagonist (played very well by Mark Harmon).

Again, Tom turns in a wonderful performance as a man, who made a promise to a dying friend to look after his widow.

Finally, in Last Stand At Sabre River, civil war veteran Tom Selleck returns to his family after a 3 year absence to resume the life he once know and again, has to deal with forces / people who are commited to seeing him gone.

These are three great films and are highly recommended.",1212451200,96,2599,4.565591397849462
3104108,5,B0013D8M44,"Tom Selleck starred in three excellent Westerns made for TNT between 1997 and 2003, and all three are now being made available in one collection. Here are brief synopses and reviews of each individual film:

""Last Stand at Saber River"" - 4 stars

Selleck is Paul Cable, a Confederate cavalryman who has come home from the Civil War (only slightly) early. He knows the war is lost for the South, he is worn out, and he only wants to take his family back to their homestead in Arizona to live a normal life. His wife, who was told that he was dead, is less than thrilled to have him back home because she is resentful that he left to fight in the war in the first place. Suzy Amis does an excellent job as Martha Cable. She is not the stereotypical beauty who runs around in a bustle under fancy dresses. She is a tough frontierswoman who has experienced many hardships and gets her husband out of some tight spots as the movie progresses.

While the majority of the movie is good at depicting the divisions between North and South that caused the Civil War and which the Civil War then exacerbated, the subplot of the inner struggles that Paul and Martha Cable face is far more interesting. It's a great movie until the end, when we get the additional time-worn subplot of a Confederate soldier who just can't give up the Lost Cause. No, it's not Selleck's character who has this problem, but Selleck already had covered this territory in 1982's ""The Shadow Riders"" (though it wasn't his character who wanted to keep fighting in that movie either); John Wayne's ""The Undefeated"" is another well-known Western with the Lost Cause plotline. In spite of the needlessly melodramatic ending, this is a strong Western, and both Selleck and TNT kept getting better and better with ""Crossfire Trail"" and ""Monte Walsh"".

""Crossfire Trail"" - 4 stars

This is the second of the TNT/Tom Selleck Westerns. Selleck revisited his early Louis L'Amour, TV-Western roots here and also re-teamed with director Simon Wincer, who directed Selleck's best big-screen effort - ""Quigley Down Under"" - as well as the all-time classic Western miniseries ""Lonesome Dove"". The result is an excellent film that, while breaking no new ground, contributes to the rich mythology and legacy of the American cowboy.

Selleck plays Rafe Covington who, at the beginning of the film, promises a dying friend that he will take care of the friend's wife and ranch. Selleck and two partners set out to do just that, and they add a new friend from the nearby town (played by Wilford Brimley) shortly after their arrival. The film is predictable: the widow is suspicious of Rafe's motives, the town bad guy has been wooing the widow in order to get at her land, the bad guy hires a hit man to eliminate Rafe, and so on. And yet, even though the viewer can see right through the plot to the end of the film, every element is so well handled that it is a pleasure to watch the movie.

I read several articles just before the film was released about the painstaking efforts made to have authentic costumes, props, sets, etc., and I must say that the filmmakers' efforts certainly paid off. The film is set in Wyoming, but was filmed in Alberta, Canada, which gives the film some of the best mountain vistas in a Western since the real Grand Tetons were featured in ""Shane"".

The reasons this film only receives four stars from me are the plot's predictability and the fact that it contains some needless strong profanity (which seems oddly out of place in a movie that continually emphasizes values such as honor and integrity). I suppose they wanted to emphasize that the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad (since the bad guys also utter the worst obscenities), but this was accomplished equally well in the other two films without the use of such strong profanity.

""Monte Walsh"" - 5 stars

This 2003 remake of ""Monte Walsh,"" also directed by Simon Wincer, was Tom Selleck's third (but hopefully not last) Western for TNT, and it is probably the most stirring film tribute to the end of the Old West and the cowboy way of life. This is saying quite a bit as some fine Westerns like ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Shootist"", and (even more recently) ""Open Range"" as well as other movies have dealt with the changes resulting from progress as the U.S. was about to enter the twentieth century.

Having mentioned that the film is set during a time of great change in the American West, I won't cover the plot line in great detail. Suffice it to say that, while Selleck's Monte Walsh is the hero of the picture, he is portrayed with character flaws intact as well. Montelius Walsh loves three things in life: horses, women, and drinking (and the order of these things changes at different times in his life). He is stubborn, afraid to commit to Martine (his favorite prostitute whom he does seem to love), and refuses to change. He is also hard-working and loyal to his friends, especially his best buddy Chet (played by Keith Carradine), and these qualities are what make his character heroic and the storyline affecting. ""Monte Walsh"" is an elegiac tribute to the passing of the Old West and the American cowboy. May both continue to live on in films!

I'm convinced that if Tom Selleck had starred primarily in Westerns throughout his film career, then his movie success would have dwarfed his ""Magnum P.I."" role. The TNT Westerns, along with his three previous Westerns dating back to 1979's ""The Sacketts"", establish him as a premier cowboy actor. ""Monte Walsh"" is the finest of his Western efforts to date, and it is to be hoped that Selleck will 'saddle up' again soon; perhaps he'll even reunite with Sam Elliott with whom he starred in his first two made-for-TV Westerns (1979's ""The Sacketts"" and 1982's ""The Shadow Riders"") and who has also made some first-rate Westerns for TNT.",1207008000,220,5842,4.677702044790652

3104683,5,B0013D8M44,"A great collection of 3 awesome westerns.  For the money this collection is hard to beat.  When John Wayne and then Clint Eastwood quit make westerns this genre was close to going extinct, but with Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott and Robert Duval a whole new wave of the American Western came into existence that to me added a wonderful new dimension to what is The American Western.  These three movies, Monte Walsh-Last Stand at Sabre River-Crossfire Trail, in my mind are his top western movies right beside his roles in Quigley Down Under and The Sacketts.

My favorite of these three is Last Stand at Saber River, where is character is a man who left his family to fight in the Civil War for the South, and comes home to a wife that is angry with him for leaving to fight for a dying cause, when his place should have been with his family.  She lost a child while he was gone and clearly is putting some of guilt she feels on him (the sentiments and anger she expresses seems so real for what I can only imagine that many spouses felt back then).  And as Selleck's character wrestles with his own guilt and trying to reclaim the land that is rightly his from men who have taken it over, he is also dealing with southerners who can't let go of the war.  I also love the role of the actress who played his wife, (Suzy Amis), who shows that real western women were as tough as the men, and she fights right along with him, her killing some of the outlaws herself.  Keith Carradine plays opposite Selleck, and is fabulous (he is also in Monte Walsh), along with David Carridine, as two of the ornery people Selleck has to deal with.  The whole movie has numerous side plots adding a wonderful dimension to it all and building to a final showdown that takes several great twists.

This collection is just great western movies and needs to be in any collection along with Quigley Down Under, El Dorado, Tombstone, Lonesome Dove, True Grit and the other classic westerns.",1418169600,,1962,4.455307262569832

3104876,4,B0013D8M44,"There is no way to do half stars, otherwise this would be 4 and one-half, but as such, I will filter this into the 5 star films.

-LAST STAND AT SABRE RIVER - my least favorite of the three, and a three star movie to me at best - though the story is written by a classic author of westerns (Elmore Leonard) this as a story does nothing for me - I do not pull for the hero, nor the family, and the structure of good and bad is blurry, and at best, trivial when it comes down to the Civil War is the enemy (in essence) and people's knowledge of its outcome is used as a weapon - not to say that this is not a good movie, but again, very tired themes, and slow story-telling

CROSSFIRE TRAIL - this is a well told story by one of the best known of the three author's in the western genre (Louis L'Amour) and was one of the last L'Amour stories turned into film. this movie is about a promise, pure and simple, and one that Tom Selleck's character will do everything to fulfill. The villain is good and believable, the story is flowing and good, and the overall story is well done - it retains the 4 star rating simply because the gun-for-hire was a bit cardboard for me, and brought the ending scenes down with a lack-luster performance.

MONTE WALSH - this is the 5 star tale of the trio, based on the novel by Jack Shaefer, who wrote SHANE - I loved all of the characters, and what turns out to be the villain is not someone that does it to be mean - life turned this person into what they became, and that is what I loved about this movie - not your typical I am Bad because I want to be type of villain - great characters and wonderful storytelling, and I completely loved this film.

I buy any movies with Tom Selleck and/or Sam Elliott because as you heard here and you will elsewhere, they truly know how to make you feel you are there.  It's a real talent these actors have in drawing the audience into the era and moment.  Add to that the other actors, producers, directors, camera operators (truly talented and no ridiculous camera spinning), locations, sets, and music are all outstanding.  I highly recommend this set.

One -- I like Tom Selleck in Western's; he's natural in his characterizations -- hero with convictions.  I like NCIS' Mark Harmon; it was interesting to see him play the bad guy in CROSSFIRE TRAIL.  Secondly, I like stories where the good guy wins.

The scenery in both movies is absolutely breathtaking; makes one want to head out west.

I had not seen MONTE WALSH before so I didn't know what to expect.  I haven't thought of a cowboy's work as a vocation, but, as so many other lines of work have vanished, the theme brings to mind how often this has happened -- even today with the introduction of the computer.  On the surface, the story just seems to be about a cowboy, but, I think, the
more important theme is changing times & ability to adapt.",1334016000,5,839,4.437908496732026

3105131,4,B0013D8M44,"I've always loved Westerns and these don't disappoint.  Tom Selleck seems to have been born in the saddle; he rides with ease and seems comfortable and very believable in each of these roles.  Monte Walsh is my favorite, though somewhat sad since his western way of life is disappearing.  I really liked Crossfire Trail, too; my only complaint is that there didn't seem to be a lot of chemistry between Tom and Virginia Madsen.  She does a fine job; I just didn't care if they got together or not.  Very different in Monte Walsh; I really was drawn into the relationship he had with Martine (Isabella Rossellini).

Last Stand at Saber River is my least favorite.  The worn theme of Civil War soldiers who don't give up after the war (the Carradines) was tiresome and he and his wife weren't getting along so well since he came back from the war.  Not my kind of story.  If I'm going to immerse myself in the West, give me a western town, a rugged hero, good guys, bad guys, a shootout, a fistfight, and a romance that builds along the way and ends happily.

But the awesome scenery in all three, the excellent depiction of the west and of cowboys, and the veteran actors in each are worth watching. Barry Corbin, William Sanderson, Wilford Brimley, Keith and David Carradine, Mark Harmon - wow.  All three movies are well done.  If you like Selleck in these kinds of roles, you'll like having the set.  I give the collection 4 stars.",1265932800,9,1433,4.529182879377432

Selleck brings much to the characters for everybody. Looks rough and tumble enough for the guys, but handsome enough for lady viewers. Enough story to keep you involved, and enough action to make you want to strap on a sixgun, and shoot a bad guy. And all without vulgarity, and nudity which,to me, is refreshing.
I recommend this set to any western fans ot those looking for a movie you can watch with your kids without cringing.

Monte Walsh was different. It was a little sad and I found that Montes life as a cowboy uncomfortably paralleled my own life. I shed tears for him but liked this film immensely.",1256774400,3,490,4.455555555555556

In fact, you WANT your kids to watch these movies.  There is no bad or unnecessary language,,, I mean NONE, and of course, while there is some violence (as is the case in Westerns), its done with class and is not done to shock your sense of propriety.

3105136,5,B0013D8M44,"At first I bought this because I not only like Western's, (a recent fascination as I didn't as a child) I mainly got this because I loved ""Quigley Down Under,"" which was absolutely great for a long range shooter like myself, but I've always enjoyed Tom Selleck shows and movies as he is very talented in whatever genre he acts in!

I must say I like him in Western's the most, the way he just sits back so seriously and takes such a serious scene and then turns around at the end with his wit will just leave you wanting more!  I can't remember anything from this collection right now, but it's like the ""Magnum"" character in ""Magnum P.I."" series we all just loved and wished we could be when we got older.

His lines are delivered perfectly in everything I've seen, in any genre, and are either written exactly for him, or their lines most likely ""addlibbed"" by Mr. Selleck himself, one line the comes to mind is when he's talking to the British officer in Australia in Quigley Down Under, ""well sir, seems like we already kicked the trash out of our country"" with the classic ""Selleck"" look just before he lights up his cigarette leaving the British soldier speechless...  I almost fell out of my chair as I was laughing so hard!  Oh, I could go on and on quoting straight faced hilarious lines delivered in every one of his pictures or television shows, but I won't and I definitely don't want to  ruin any movies for anyone, but for those who have watched him in other shows, you know what I mean.

Well, if your looking for three separate Western movies and not a series with part 1, 2 & 3, then this is the set for you, you can see how he plays each part as a different character but still has that Selleck wit and flare we have all grown to love over the years!  IMHO!!!",1248825600,5,1777,4.331325301204819

3105138,5,B0013D8M44,"...who am I to differ?

All three films in this collection are great. The production values are superb and the casting is just first rate. If these three films don't bury the notion that Tom Selleck is nothing more than a serviceable screen hunk then nothing ever will. Selleck has great screen presence and is a fine actor. Had he been born 20 or 30 years earlier he could have been a western superstar in the mold of a John Wayne.

To clear up any confusion: Last Stand at Saber River is in full screen 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Crossfire Trail and Monte Walsh are in widescreen 1.78:1 aspect ratio. And although Selleck has starred with Sam Elliott in other westerns, Elliott is not in any of these.

In short, if you have any interest in the western genre you owe it to yourself to check out these films. Don't be put off by any ""made for TV"" reservations you might have. And save a few bucks and buy all three together in the Tom Selleck Western Collection. They're just the three separate DVDs, cases and all, that have been put in a new box.

Same tired stories and lame acting over, and over, and over again. But that's not to say I don't appreciate a well done movie, whatever the genre.  This is one.  I bought this for mom, who loves all things Selleck, as part of the Tom Selleck Western Collection.  I thought I'd seen this as well as the other two films (Monte Walsh, Crossfire Trail).  I was mistaken about this one. It was a pleasure to see the Carradine brothers together and a very young Haley Joel Osment as Selleck's (Paul Cable's) son.  Suzy Amis is excellent in her role as the take-no-guff frontier wife who feels her marriage may be over due to the changes the civil war has bestowed on her husband's psyche. He is disillusioned by the atrocities of war he witnessed and deeply saddened to learn of the loss of his youngest daughter during his absence. I won't go into further detail as it's been done exceedingly well by others here.  Suffices to say the writing, acting and all other aspects of this movie are very well executed. I would recommend this movie and the Tom Selleck Western Collection to those who consider themselves fans of fine movies.

3338604,5,B0013D8M44,"I grew up at a time when westerns dominated television and John Wayne was the world's #1 movie star so it was inevitable that westerns would become my favorite film genre.

And then suddenly, westerns just seemed to drop off the face of the earth and with the exception of the occasional film - Unforgiven / Dances With Wolves and a few others, this genre was verging on extinction.

But thank goodness for people like Clint (in his earlier years), Sam Elliot and Tom Selleck, who have done their very best to keep the western alive.

This collection of Tom Selleck's TNT / made-for-television films is a wonderful addition to anybody's collection of great western films. Tom is a very believable and credible cowboy, who epitomizes the code that many western men of the late 19th century lived by - honor/ integrity.

We, of course, had our first glimpse of Tom as a western star in some of his earlier films - The Sacketts / The Shadow Riders / Quigley Down Under and he continues to maintain the level of excellence he established with Monte Walsh / Crossfire Tail and Last Stand At Sabre River.

I think what sets these types of films apart is that they have little choice but to stand on nothing more than compelling stories and solid performances. Unlike so many of the movies that are so popular today, these films don't rely on incredible special effects or computer generated images to hold our attention. The story and character development is the primary appeal of these films.

Monte Walsh is a tough act to follow as it's a remake of the classic western film that starred Lee Marvin and the incomparable Jack Palance as two aging cowboys who have to deal with the fact that the west of their youth is changing and the 20th centruy is looming very large.

Tom as Monte and David Carridine as his life long pal, Chet, are more than up for the challenge.

It's a wonderful story with great performances by the two stars and supporting cast.

Crossfire Trial is an adaptation of a great Louis L'Amour book and deals with a common theme in westerns - the good guy dealing with seemingly insurmoutable odds to fend off an ambitious and ruthless antagonist (played very well by Mark Harmon).

Again, Tom turns in a wonderful performance as a man, who made a promise to a dying friend to look after his widow.

Finally, in Last Stand At Sabre River, civil war veteran Tom Selleck returns to his family after a 3 year absence to resume the life he once know and again, has to deal with forces / people who are commited to seeing him gone.

These are three great films and are highly recommended.",1212451200,96,2599,4.565591397849462
3338605,5,B0013D8M44,"Tom Selleck starred in three excellent Westerns made for TNT between 1997 and 2003, and all three are now being made available in one collection. Here are brief synopses and reviews of each individual film:

""Last Stand at Saber River"" - 4 stars

Selleck is Paul Cable, a Confederate cavalryman who has come home from the Civil War (only slightly) early. He knows the war is lost for the South, he is worn out, and he only wants to take his family back to their homestead in Arizona to live a normal life. His wife, who was told that he was dead, is less than thrilled to have him back home because she is resentful that he left to fight in the war in the first place. Suzy Amis does an excellent job as Martha Cable. She is not the stereotypical beauty who runs around in a bustle under fancy dresses. She is a tough frontierswoman who has experienced many hardships and gets her husband out of some tight spots as the movie progresses.

While the majority of the movie is good at depicting the divisions between North and South that caused the Civil War and which the Civil War then exacerbated, the subplot of the inner struggles that Paul and Martha Cable face is far more interesting. It's a great movie until the end, when we get the additional time-worn subplot of a Confederate soldier who just can't give up the Lost Cause. No, it's not Selleck's character who has this problem, but Selleck already had covered this territory in 1982's ""The Shadow Riders"" (though it wasn't his character who wanted to keep fighting in that movie either); John Wayne's ""The Undefeated"" is another well-known Western with the Lost Cause plotline. In spite of the needlessly melodramatic ending, this is a strong Western, and both Selleck and TNT kept getting better and better with ""Crossfire Trail"" and ""Monte Walsh"".

""Crossfire Trail"" - 4 stars

This is the second of the TNT/Tom Selleck Westerns. Selleck revisited his early Louis L'Amour, TV-Western roots here and also re-teamed with director Simon Wincer, who directed Selleck's best big-screen effort - ""Quigley Down Under"" - as well as the all-time classic Western miniseries ""Lonesome Dove"". The result is an excellent film that, while breaking no new ground, contributes to the rich mythology and legacy of the American cowboy.

Selleck plays Rafe Covington who, at the beginning of the film, promises a dying friend that he will take care of the friend's wife and ranch. Selleck and two partners set out to do just that, and they add a new friend from the nearby town (played by Wilford Brimley) shortly after their arrival. The film is predictable: the widow is suspicious of Rafe's motives, the town bad guy has been wooing the widow in order to get at her land, the bad guy hires a hit man to eliminate Rafe, and so on. And yet, even though the viewer can see right through the plot to the end of the film, every element is so well handled that it is a pleasure to watch the movie.

I read several articles just before the film was released about the painstaking efforts made to have authentic costumes, props, sets, etc., and I must say that the filmmakers' efforts certainly paid off. The film is set in Wyoming, but was filmed in Alberta, Canada, which gives the film some of the best mountain vistas in a Western since the real Grand Tetons were featured in ""Shane"".

The reasons this film only receives four stars from me are the plot's predictability and the fact that it contains some needless strong profanity (which seems oddly out of place in a movie that continually emphasizes values such as honor and integrity). I suppose they wanted to emphasize that the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad (since the bad guys also utter the worst obscenities), but this was accomplished equally well in the other two films without the use of such strong profanity.

""Monte Walsh"" - 5 stars

This 2003 remake of ""Monte Walsh,"" also directed by Simon Wincer, was Tom Selleck's third (but hopefully not last) Western for TNT, and it is probably the most stirring film tribute to the end of the Old West and the cowboy way of life. This is saying quite a bit as some fine Westerns like ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Shootist"", and (even more recently) ""Open Range"" as well as other movies have dealt with the changes resulting from progress as the U.S. was about to enter the twentieth century.

Having mentioned that the film is set during a time of great change in the American West, I won't cover the plot line in great detail. Suffice it to say that, while Selleck's Monte Walsh is the hero of the picture, he is portrayed with character flaws intact as well. Montelius Walsh loves three things in life: horses, women, and drinking (and the order of these things changes at different times in his life). He is stubborn, afraid to commit to Martine (his favorite prostitute whom he does seem to love), and refuses to change. He is also hard-working and loyal to his friends, especially his best buddy Chet (played by Keith Carradine), and these qualities are what make his character heroic and the storyline affecting. ""Monte Walsh"" is an elegiac tribute to the passing of the Old West and the American cowboy. May both continue to live on in films!

I'm convinced that if Tom Selleck had starred primarily in Westerns throughout his film career, then his movie success would have dwarfed his ""Magnum P.I."" role. The TNT Westerns, along with his three previous Westerns dating back to 1979's ""The Sacketts"", establish him as a premier cowboy actor. ""Monte Walsh"" is the finest of his Western efforts to date, and it is to be hoped that Selleck will 'saddle up' again soon; perhaps he'll even reunite with Sam Elliott with whom he starred in his first two made-for-TV Westerns (1979's ""The Sacketts"" and 1982's ""The Shadow Riders"") and who has also made some first-rate Westerns for TNT.",1207008000,220,5842,4.677702044790652

3339180,5,B0013D8M44,"A great collection of 3 awesome westerns.  For the money this collection is hard to beat.  When John Wayne and then Clint Eastwood quit make westerns this genre was close to going extinct, but with Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott and Robert Duval a whole new wave of the American Western came into existence that to me added a wonderful new dimension to what is The American Western.  These three movies, Monte Walsh-Last Stand at Sabre River-Crossfire Trail, in my mind are his top western movies right beside his roles in Quigley Down Under and The Sacketts.

My favorite of these three is Last Stand at Saber River, where is character is a man who left his family to fight in the Civil War for the South, and comes home to a wife that is angry with him for leaving to fight for a dying cause, when his place should have been with his family.  She lost a child while he was gone and clearly is putting some of guilt she feels on him (the sentiments and anger she expresses seems so real for what I can only imagine that many spouses felt back then).  And as Selleck's character wrestles with his own guilt and trying to reclaim the land that is rightly his from men who have taken it over, he is also dealing with southerners who can't let go of the war.  I also love the role of the actress who played his wife, (Suzy Amis), who shows that real western women were as tough as the men, and she fights right along with him, her killing some of the outlaws herself.  Keith Carradine plays opposite Selleck, and is fabulous (he is also in Monte Walsh), along with David Carridine, as two of the ornery people Selleck has to deal with.  The whole movie has numerous side plots adding a wonderful dimension to it all and building to a final showdown that takes several great twists.

This collection is just great western movies and needs to be in any collection along with Quigley Down Under, El Dorado, Tombstone, Lonesome Dove, True Grit and the other classic westerns.",1418169600,,1962,4.455307262569832

3339373,4,B0013D8M44,"There is no way to do half stars, otherwise this would be 4 and one-half, but as such, I will filter this into the 5 star films.

-LAST STAND AT SABRE RIVER - my least favorite of the three, and a three star movie to me at best - though the story is written by a classic author of westerns (Elmore Leonard) this as a story does nothing for me - I do not pull for the hero, nor the family, and the structure of good and bad is blurry, and at best, trivial when it comes down to the Civil War is the enemy (in essence) and people's knowledge of its outcome is used as a weapon - not to say that this is not a good movie, but again, very tired themes, and slow story-telling

CROSSFIRE TRAIL - this is a well told story by one of the best known of the three author's in the western genre (Louis L'Amour) and was one of the last L'Amour stories turned into film. this movie is about a promise, pure and simple, and one that Tom Selleck's character will do everything to fulfill. The villain is good and believable, the story is flowing and good, and the overall story is well done - it retains the 4 star rating simply because the gun-for-hire was a bit cardboard for me, and brought the ending scenes down with a lack-luster performance.

MONTE WALSH - this is the 5 star tale of the trio, based on the novel by Jack Shaefer, who wrote SHANE - I loved all of the characters, and what turns out to be the villain is not someone that does it to be mean - life turned this person into what they became, and that is what I loved about this movie - not your typical I am Bad because I want to be type of villain - great characters and wonderful storytelling, and I completely loved this film.

Though Selleck has a couple other westerns worth watching, I bought these three movies for 10 dollars, and I got my money's worth and then some - a must own for Selleck fans and Western fans alike.",1391385600,,1883,4.122615803814714

I buy any movies with Tom Selleck and/or Sam Elliott because as you heard here and you will elsewhere, they truly know how to make you feel you are there.  It's a real talent these actors have in drawing the audience into the era and moment.  Add to that the other actors, producers, directors, camera operators (truly talented and no ridiculous camera spinning), locations, sets, and music are all outstanding.  I highly recommend this set.

One -- I like Tom Selleck in Western's; he's natural in his characterizations -- hero with convictions.  I like NCIS' Mark Harmon; it was interesting to see him play the bad guy in CROSSFIRE TRAIL.  Secondly, I like stories where the good guy wins.

The scenery in both movies is absolutely breathtaking; makes one want to head out west.

I had not seen MONTE WALSH before so I didn't know what to expect.  I haven't thought of a cowboy's work as a vocation, but, as so many other lines of work have vanished, the theme brings to mind how often this has happened -- even today with the introduction of the computer.  On the surface, the story just seems to be about a cowboy, but, I think, the

3339628,4,B0013D8M44,"I've always loved Westerns and these don't disappoint.  Tom Selleck seems to have been born in the saddle; he rides with ease and seems comfortable and very believable in each of these roles.  Monte Walsh is my favorite, though somewhat sad since his western way of life is disappearing.  I really liked Crossfire Trail, too; my only complaint is that there didn't seem to be a lot of chemistry between Tom and Virginia Madsen.  She does a fine job; I just didn't care if they got together or not.  Very different in Monte Walsh; I really was drawn into the relationship he had with Martine (Isabella Rossellini).

Last Stand at Saber River is my least favorite.  The worn theme of Civil War soldiers who don't give up after the war (the Carradines) was tiresome and he and his wife weren't getting along so well since he came back from the war.  Not my kind of story.  If I'm going to immerse myself in the West, give me a western town, a rugged hero, good guys, bad guys, a shootout, a fistfight, and a romance that builds along the way and ends happily.

But the awesome scenery in all three, the excellent depiction of the west and of cowboys, and the veteran actors in each are worth watching. Barry Corbin, William Sanderson, Wilford Brimley, Keith and David Carradine, Mark Harmon - wow.  All three movies are well done.  If you like Selleck in these kinds of roles, you'll like having the set.  I give the collection 4 stars.",1265932800,9,1433,4.529182879377432

Selleck brings much to the characters for everybody. Looks rough and tumble enough for the guys, but handsome enough for lady viewers. Enough story to keep you involved, and enough action to make you want to strap on a sixgun, and shoot a bad guy. And all without vulgarity, and nudity which,to me, is refreshing.
I recommend this set to any western fans ot those looking for a movie you can watch with your kids without cringing.
There is violence, but no intestines or brains splattered all over the place, and of course it is good guys vs. bad guys with no gray area as to which is which.",1256860800,9,826,4.47682119205298

Crossfire Trail and Last Stand at Sabre River are average western stories of good versus evil with the good guys triumphing in the end. These are the sort of films I loved as a teenager and I viewed these with some nostalgia.
Monte Walsh was different. It was a little sad and I found that Montes life as a cowboy uncomfortably paralleled my own life. I shed tears for him but liked this film immensely.",1256774400,3,490,4.455555555555556
3339631,5,B0013D8M44,"I am a Tom Selleck fan and a Western film fan.  This collection has both for me, and it is a terrific value!  Great product!",1256083200,,124,3.92
3339632,5,B0013D8M44,"As an avid John Wayne Western fan, its refreshing to see the Selleck Western collection.  Monte Walsh is just plane awesome and Selleck and Carradine make the movie a classic.  What I enjoy most about these movies is that you don't have to run for the remote and shut it off just because your daughter or son come into the room.  In fact, you WANT your kids to watch these movies.  There is no bad or unnecessary language,,, I mean NONE, and of course, while there is some violence (as is the case in Westerns), its done with class and is not done to shock your sense of propriety.  When the bad guy gets it,,, you say ""yeah!.""  When a good guy gets it, or a child is hurt, or a woman is hurt, you sympathize!  Awesome drama.  These movies will endure and will serve that we were a civilized society, at least once.",1250467200,6,815,4.246753246753247
3339633,5,B0013D8M44,"At first I bought this because I not only like Western's, (a recent fascination as I didn't as a child) I mainly got this because I loved ""Quigley Down Under,"" which was absolutely great for a long range shooter like myself, but I've always enjoyed Tom Selleck shows and movies as he is very talented in whatever genre he acts in!

I must say I like him in Western's the most, the way he just sits back so seriously and takes such a serious scene and then turns around at the end with his wit will just leave you wanting more!  I can't remember anything from this collection right now, but it's like the ""Magnum"" character in ""Magnum P.I."" series we all just loved and wished we could be when we got older.

His lines are delivered perfectly in everything I've seen, in any genre, and are either written exactly for him, or their lines most likely ""addlibbed"" by Mr. Selleck himself, one line the comes to mind is when he's talking to the British officer in Australia in Quigley Down Under, ""well sir, seems like we already kicked the trash out of our country"" with the classic ""Selleck"" look just before he lights up his cigarette leaving the British soldier speechless...  I almost fell out of my chair as I was laughing so hard!  Oh, I could go on and on quoting straight faced hilarious lines delivered in every one of his pictures or television shows, but I won't and I definitely don't want to  ruin any movies for anyone, but for those who have watched him in other shows, you know what I mean.

Well, if your looking for three separate Western movies and not a series with part 1, 2 & 3, then this is the set for you, you can see how he plays each part as a different character but still has that Selleck wit and flare we have all grown to love over the years!  IMHO!!!",1248825600,5,1777,4.331325301204819
3339634,5,B0013D8M44,Three great movies.  Wish there were more in this collection.  I am not sure how many westerns there actually are with Selleck but these were great.  I got these for my husband and he  and I have enjoyed each movie.  Ofcourse we have seen all of them before!!  The quality is great in these films and is well worth your money!  Enjoy,1246233600,,333,4.274193548387097
3339635,5,B0013D8M44,"...who am I to differ?

All three films in this collection are great. The production values are superb and the casting is just first rate. If these three films don't bury the notion that Tom Selleck is nothing more than a serviceable screen hunk then nothing ever will. Selleck has great screen presence and is a fine actor. Had he been born 20 or 30 years earlier he could have been a western superstar in the mold of a John Wayne.

To clear up any confusion: Last Stand at Saber River is in full screen 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Crossfire Trail and Monte Walsh are in widescreen 1.78:1 aspect ratio. And although Selleck has starred with Sam Elliott in other westerns, Elliott is not in any of these.

In short, if you have any interest in the western genre you owe it to yourself to check out these films. Don't be put off by any ""made for TV"" reservations you might have. And save a few bucks and buy all three together in the Tom Selleck Western Collection. They're just the three separate DVDs, cases and all, that have been put in a new box. If you like one, you'll like them all.",1244246400,6,1082,4.346534653465347

3339637,3,B0013D8M44,The 3 movies in this collection are great. They would only play in 1 of my dvd players and jumped terribly in my PC dvd drive. Only my high priced player would play them so be careful. These 3 movies are the best morden day westerns made good for the whole family.

3339638,5,B0013D8M44,Just got these movies in and watched them within a week. All three are excellent as Tom Selleck makes the best cowboy around. Can't go wrong with the price either....box set of three movies for less then $8.00. Doesn't get much better than that and they are good enough to watch multiple times.,1239148800,3,294,4.566037735849057
