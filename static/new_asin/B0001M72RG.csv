8014570,3,B0001M72RG,This was posted as a prior rental and it shows a lot of wear mainly the screen going to blank a few times and a lot of action of the screen around the bottom of the screen. I would list it as fair condition and no good as listed. It is clearly marked as a Holllywood Rental and this goes back a long time and now out of business. The price was low so I guess worth the price After I finished the film I noted that I was told to clean my video heads a total of 4 times throughout the movie. I looked at the one I had received and the tape was filthy and covered with a white powder.. All in all I was able to understand the movie but clearly not as listed. I will through it away as it wasn't that good anyway rather than go through all the trouble of fighting with the seller. It as a sheep ;buy and so I found out why.,1433894400,,819,3.7953216374269005
8014571,1,B0001M72RG,"This endeavour to produce a television pilot film is blessed with having location shooting in Hong Kong, easily one of the Far East's most picturesque cities, but the work was understandably not claimed as forerunner of a TV series since the artless heroics of the eponymous hero, Joe Blade (Terry Lester), although adequately vigourous, are no substitute for a well-crafted script, and such is not available here.  Action opens at a retirement banquet being held for a venerable Hong Kong businessman (Keye Luke), who we learn has adopted Blade as son, and during the festive function Joe, a private investigator, foils an attempted assassination of his ""father"", following which he chases the culprits, a pursuit that leads him into many dangerous and fairly absurd situations, during most of which he is physically attacked, as is customary with fictional private eyes.  Joe also utilizes the proffered aid of a local street ragamuffin and finds opportunity to develop a romantic relationship with an attractive clothing designer, played by Ellen Regan, but most of his activity is composed of somewhat monotonous and quite predictable episodes that engage him in trying to protect his adoptive father who seemingly has little concern for his own safety.  There is scant suspense fostered by this routine melodrama, with the script including a good deal of expository dialogue that is meant to provide backgrounds of the characters and, in addition to being less than subtle, this is indicative of typical television productions along with the single takes and obvious editing of scenes to provide for commercial breaks.  Leslie Nielsen, and Nancy Kwan, are cast as a deceitful entrepreneur, and his wife, and come off better defined than first billed Lester, who wants authority within his conception of his part, notably so in romantic sequences with Regan; as might be expected, Luke wins acting honours handily as he makes something substantial of his lines.  There is a good deal of footage depicting Hong Kong, perhaps the most interesting minutes of this by the numbers affair.",1141516800,,2087,5.199404761904762
