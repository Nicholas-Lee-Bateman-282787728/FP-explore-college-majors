8575384,3,B00BY8DNM4,"First off, I have to confess I am not big on musicals.  I got this film because I am a fan of Fred Allen, and you don't get many chances to see him on your TV screen!

The story is pretty standard for the genre.  If you like good old singing and dancing, there is a lot here for you.

Fred Allen does a good job as the manager of Sally, Irene, and Mary, aspiring performers who are down to their last can of beans.  Gregory Ratoff plays a rich foreigner who ""wants a honeymoon"", and keeps changing his mind on who to have it with!  Jimmy Durante has a rather small role as a street sweeper, who ends up working with Allen, and has one singing number.

Of course, Alice Faye and Tony Martin do most of the singing.

A light film, not spectacular, but still entertaining.  In my highly biased opinion, Fred Allen is the best thing in it!",1375660800,2,835,4.136645962732919
8575385,3,B00BY8DNM4,"Funny how our minds trick us when it comes to memories of films we have seen in the past.
I recall this being a wonderful musical comedy of the 30's. But the film is really a slapdash vehicle for Alice Faye. Joan Davis steals the film as she did so often but it is not enough to make up for the standard script and production.
The quality is ok...............Fox Archives needs a great deal of help in the area of quality control.",1369094400,2,430,4.2560975609756095
8575386,3,B00BY8DNM4,"By 1938, Alice Faye was big news at the boxoffice and ""Sally, Irene and Mary"" was one in a series of lightweight musical comedies which built her to stardom. This one capitalised on her recent marriage to Tony Martin of the smooth tenor. Their rapport, particularly singing the duet ""I could use a Dream"" is obvious. The film traces the exploits of 3 manicurists who are trying to break into show business as vocalists. The other two are Joan Davis, of the broad comedy, and Marjorie Weaver, being singled out for stardom but never making the big time. Daryl F. Zanuck, head of the studio, had a very successful formula with these musicals, filling them with comedians and specialty acts. In this one, Jimmy Durante has an amusing role, Fred Allen, famous in radio, has a prominent part, Louise Hovick (Gypsy Rose Lee) is on board for some acid comedy, the Brian Sisters appear in the swing number ""Who Stole the Jam"" and Gregory Ratoff steals every scene in which he appears. The musical highlight for me is ""This is Where I came in"" sung in loving closeup warmly and emotionally by Alice Faye in what became her trademark delivery. This was the material of a superstar (which she subsequently became.)

The film has been released as a DVD on demand from the 20th Century Fox Archives. This means it is no frills with no chapters, no extras, no nothing.  At least the print is good.  One last thing; the print does not contain a number of scenes and musical numbers which were cut when it reached television. When will we see the Faye/Martin duet of the haunting ""Half Moon on the Hudson?""",1367798400,9,1590,4.6113074204946995
8575387,5,B00BY8DNM4,"I bought this DVD because I'm a big fan of Alice Faye and because so few of her films from the middle 1930s are available on DVD or VHS. I was not disappointed with the film and I'm thrilled to see this one available on DVD. Thank you, 20th Century Fox for finally seeing that there is a market for these films!

I have had CDs and record albums featuring the songs from this film for years and it's nice to finally hear them in the context of the film! The big surprise for me was the delightful number by Jimmy Durante, which was not included on any CD I have. As usual, he's a scene stealer and pretty much leaves the rest of the cast in the dust whenever he's in the mix.

As part of the Fox Cinema Archives series, this DVD is completely bare bones: no chapters, no trailer, no extras of any kind - just the movie.

Alice, Joan and Marjorie Weaver are manicurists who dream of their chance singing in a Broadway review. Through a series of mishaps and Jimmy Durante popping in, Marjorie's uncle leaves them an old steamer that they turn into a showboat. A lot of improbable circumstances ensue but, of course, it all turns out fine in the end.

Also in the cast are Alice Faye's husband (at the time) Tony Martin and comedienne Joan Davis. I must admit that Joan Davis is an acquired taste (kind of like the Ritz Brothers) but I like her, although I can't picture that voice as part of a singing trio. Look for Louise Hovick (aka Gypsy Rose Lee ) as the wealthy protagonist.",1367712000,4,1479,4.271428571428571
