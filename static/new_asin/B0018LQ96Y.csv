8269993,5,B0018LQ96Y,"For her birthday, I sent my granddaughter (9 years old) this book along with the Jugglebug clubs, the Duncan Juggling Balls, and the Dancing Scarves ... all from Amazon. I might add that I did my research and the best products and prices were on Amazon. My granddaughter loved it all! I also sent her parents an informational sheet I found on the internet about how juggling makes you smarter and improves coordination. Evidently some pro football players took it up to improve their ball handling. Once I started looking into this juggling thing, it seems that a good half of the people in the USA are juggling.",1444348800,2,612,4.675925925925926

Nice scenary too. Good quality, worth the price, a great gift for anyone.",1231372800,7,242,4.853658536585366
