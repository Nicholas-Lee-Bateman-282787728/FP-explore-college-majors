If you pay attention, you'll see heineken product placement all through the entire movie.lol",1355356800,,129,5.190476190476191
3036635,4,B000YW8RNG,The movie was great and the person I brought the movie from is great and i am happy to have purchase this movie,1328918400,,111,3.869565217391304
3036636,5,B000YW8RNG,"Wow, The music is fine, the dances are great, the story could be better, but over all was a fun movie, with a little bit of love and gansters rappers...",1232496000,2,152,4.1
3036637,1,B000YW8RNG,jennifer Lopez should stick to singing because this movie she directed is aweful and boring the previews make you think its all about dancing but its not there is like maybe 3 parts of dancing in it it is a waste of time to even watch it,1217116800,5,237,4.0638297872340425
3036638,1,B000YW8RNG,"There are definitely worst movies than this,but it's an ok movie, Omarion can't act but keeps get movie roles i don't get it & his rapping was horrible,the best thing about the movie was seeing Zulay Henao",1213142400,4,205,4.5675675675675675
3036639,1,B000YW8RNG,"I had to force myself not to throw this one away.  I am an avid movie watcher and tend to watch simply for entertainment purposes.  I try not to set my expectations too high and always try not to be critical of someone else's creativity.  Having said that, I fall short on all points when it comes to this movie.  There isn't a polite or nice way to evaluate it...IT SUCKS BIG TIME!!!  After watching You Got Served, I thought Omarion did an okay job acting.  Considering he's a singer he did better than many others who preceed him.  Which makes me wonder why people at the hieght of their own craft would subject themselves to criticism for something that they don't ""have to"" do?  It's like listening to an awful song on one of your favorite artists cd...you think to yourself...did they really think this was a good song when they were recording?  If after reading a script, they feel as though it's something they want to be a part of, I can understand that.  What I can't understand is, if after they start to filming, and they things aren't going too well - why don't they pull out or regroup?

Shame on JLo for allowing this to be released under her name.  It's not like she needs something extra to win fans.

I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie for rent or purchase.",1205625600,8,1283,4.431623931623932
