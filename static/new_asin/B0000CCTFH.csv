On the cover it says lessons are shown and with explanations.  Well, there maybe explanations, but they are in Taiwanese and guess what, I don't speak Taiwanese!  Nice examples of some forms, but lessons . . .explanations . . .short range combat volume 1, I don't think so!

Go spend your money on ""Unleashed"" or ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"".  It's money better spent with no illusions.",1162080000,,518,4.637362637362638
