8160039,4,B000L42NLO,"Ignore the simpleton who obviously didn't bother to watch the documentary, but rather decided to base his entire review on the incorrect date Amazon attributed to the film.  Anyone who has ever seen anything filmed in the 60s can tell right away this isn't that old, not to mention (c)2001 is the date at the end of the credits.  Anyway, with regard to the actual content, it's a schoolroom style documentary, fairly slow but informative, and if that's something that interests you, give it a look.  If you want something faster paced, give it a pass.",1524355200,,551,4.71875

8160041,2,B000L42NLO,"This documentary is nearly as old as the Arthur myth itself, dating to AD1969. If you want to learn what historians have learned in succeeding decades, there is plenty of well-researched information online.  I suggest that this film be removed.",1518307200,,244,5.1

8160043,5,B000L42NLO,"This documentary explores the ancient and modern cultural contexts which surrounded the development and continued popularity of Arthurian legend. Accompanied by unique footage of various important sites, the narrator presents details that I have never heard elsewhere. Here you will hear the basic structure of Arthur's tale, and may also gain a more thorough understanding of the myths and legends upon which the tales were based. They wrap it up nicely by exploring the impact this ancient legend still has on the minds of people today.

Five star rating based on the footage of important historical sites and the depth of information regarding popular beliefs at the times of origin of different elements of the legend.",1452124800,3,722,5.224137931034483
