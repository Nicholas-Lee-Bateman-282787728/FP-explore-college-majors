838256,5,6304293925,"This is a great, great film. One of Disney's finest live action films. It ranks right up there with The Swiss Family Robinson and Treasure Island. So Disney, where is the DVD? I am not talking about the Full-Screen DVD thrown out for members of the Disney fan club, I am talking about a beautiful widescreen transfer with James MacArthur commentary. I think a movie which is one of Peter O'Toole's first (pre-nosejob) performances, and one of Finch's finest should be available for me to buy on DVD.

Please, no more Fox and the Hound 2. Focus your efforts on Kidnapped. If Candleshoe can be on DVD, so can this.",1169683200,,612,4.5636363636363635
838257,5,6304293925,"I have nothing to add by qualitative review beside reinforcement of the opinion of it as being a rare masterpiece within the Disney field.

Here you are selling VHS copies for as low as $0.59 per copy while the British are selling their DVDs at 5 pounds, or the like. My question is: who's the idiot, or should I say, ""developmentally diabled executive"" at Disney who can't figure out how to market this classic to all the high-spirited people of Scot Ancestry in America. You know, the ones who are still rewinding their worn out VHS trying to get to the part where Alan Breck Stewart ""cannae kill a man who plays the pipes a brae as Robin MacGregor""",1153612800,2,651,4.470588235294118
838258,5,6304293925,"It was my utter disappointment with the 2005 British production of Kidnapped, as shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theater, that caused me to see for the 2nd time this more faithful 1960 Disney production.  Whoever directed the 2005 film completely changed the plot from that found in the original.  Not only were scenes not found in the book included in the film, but the names of the two main character's Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour
were shortened and changed to simply Alan Breck and Davie Balfour.  The 1960 film, however, was so well done when I first saw it while I was in high school, it inspired me to read the original book.",1140048000,2,635,4.601769911504425

Peter Finch is top notch as Alan Breck and leads us through the Scottish highlands with zest and a real sense of adventure. James MacArthur is a cracking good David Balfor. And Peter O'Toole is simply wonderful in his cameo as a dueling piper!

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaay overdue on DVD in the US, it has been readily available in the UK on Region 2 disc. Hopefully, Disney will release a deluxe Region 1 disc in the very near future. They could give us Walt Disney's introduction and backround from the early Disney television program, a biography of Stevenson, a pdf file of the book (long in public domain), etc. Think of the potential!

A fun film for the whole family! Really.",1121299200,4,752,4.732824427480916
838260,4,6304293925,"I love most of the Disney live action movies. Any fan of their movies like ""Swiss Family Robinson"" and ""Treasure Island"" should enjoy this movie. Some great acting from James MacArthur, Christopher Plummer, and Peter O'Toole add to the believability we are in Scotland and living the adventure with them.

 A wonderful story of a Scottsman's adventure after his fathers death. An Uncle that does not wish to share his estate with his brothers son, has him kidnapped. Adventure on the high seas and land both make it an exceptional film. Some great fight and escape scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting, directing, scenery, and music make this Disney movie stand out as one of the best in their series of classic movies.

 I hope along with many of the other live action Disney movies that are coming out on DVD this will be put on DVD as well. It would be great to get some more background of Scottish history in a documentary included with the movie.",1083888000,5,972,4.568965517241379
838261,5,6304293925,"Originally released in 1960, filmed 10 years after Disney's ""Treasure Island"" (Both are based on books written by Robert Louis Stevenson). This is a grittier more realistic film than Treasure Island, not as flamboyant. Coincidentally, Disney Director Robert Stevenson wrote the screenplay based on the novel but he is not related to the original writer.

Set in 18th centurey Scotland, it features James MacArthur who made 5 other films for Disney as a young man, and later moved on to ""Hawaii 5-O"". The film starts with a plot of a young man finding out he has an estate after his father dies, and when he goes to reclaim it his uncle tries to cheat him out of it. There is a famous scene where the uncle tries to kill the young man by sending up a tower in the dark... with missing stairs. Peter Finch is the Hero that takes him under his wing. They have to battle their way off a ship as cutthroat sailors try to murder them. The movie draws you in, as it is very realistic and loaded with period atmosphere, costumes, sets, and weapons. The British are chasing the Scottish Highlanders all over the countryside which is loaded with friends and traitors, and so they can trust no one. There are many character actors that add to the richness of the film. This film is a rollicking good time, and has intrigue, adventure, and mystery as well. Swordfights and gun battles galore! There are numerous authentic Scottish actors and accents, as it was filmed on location in Scotland. While Disney films that were made in Europe were criticized for being ""too Americanized"" they loved this film and praised both it's authenticity to the original book.

The color is beautiful on this nice clean print. This film is not for the smallest kids as it does have some scary scenes and some violence. (But keep in mind that the film still takes a strong stand against killing and drinking/gambling. Nice moral lessons without being preachy. The stars fight because they have too, and truly regret having to participate in violence to defend themselves).",1045094400,13,2042,4.717086834733894

838436,3,6304293925,"As a family we recently read out loud and loved the classic Robert Louis Stevenson book.  It's always hard for a movie to live up to a book that is loved.  We felt that both David and Alan were both miscast, and were not able to convey the dashing vibrancy and extraordinary bond between the two characters.  The screenplay was okay in its attempt to extract a 90 minute telling respectful of the book's tale, and at some key moments literally cut language directly from the book into an actor's mouth.  A few of the supporting actors were vivid and their characters were compelling, for example, Ebenezer and Ransome.  But, what makes the book so great is David and Alan's hearts and humanity, and the actors fall short of bringing this to life.",1468540800,,746,4.578947368421052

838569,5,6304293925,"The Scottish landscape and music, the vigor of Alan Breck, the decency of David Balfour, and the adventures they have in Scotland are all things I love about this 1960 Disney movie.  Peter Finch does extraordinary acting as the hotheaded, but noble and sensible, Alan Breck, who desires Scottish independence from Britain.  His counterpart, David Balfour, played by James MacArthur, is a young man whose sense of clear right-and-wrong behaviors is challenged by numerous experiences he has with Alan.  There is actually a lot of political substance to this movie regarding the appropriateness of violence and what to do when the supposed rightful heir to the throne of Scotland, or to David Balfour's estate, is being opposed.  David Balfour is the rightful heir to the House of Shaws, but his uncle won't let him have it, and gets him shanghaied on a slave ship to the Carolinas.  The ship encounters fog and smashes nationalist Alan Breck's boat, and Alan joins David on the slave ship.  They encounter difficulties getting to land and just as many dangers from unprincipled men, including the Campbell clan, on land.  Alan and David share an interesting relationship and ultimately work together to help David gain the estate he's entitled to.  I really enjoy the feel of Scotland in this movie, and the action, dangers, interesting dialogue, and Alan's cunning.  Peter O'Toole also is in it briefly, playing the bagpipes.  I very much enjoy Walt Disney's period movies from this era.  It's an amazing coincidence that Robert Stevenson adapted to a screenplay, and directed, a story by Robert Louis Stevenson!",1444089600,3,1612,5.068181818181818

Peter Finch is definitely the best Alan Breck: swashbuckling, warm-hearted, generous, and open. The scene of him and Peter O'Toole as Macgregor playing the pipes is hilarious.....the young man who plays David Balfour is a bit wooden, but I can forgive that as the rest of it is so good. It's true to the SPIRIT of the book.

838792,5,6304293925,"This film has long since been a favorite of mine that I haven't seen in decades.  I was surprised at how accurate my memory was, everything was exactly as I fondly remembered it.  It starts as so many Disney films did with a recently orphaned young man (James MacArthur) out to claim his inheritance.  (Disney seemed to gravitate towards stories involving dead parents.  Kind of takes the `family' out of family entertainment.)  The plot is rich with scoundrels, villains, intrigue, a curse on the House of Shaws, a shipwreck, a murderous uncle (John Laurie as the aptly named Ebenezer Balfour), soldiers on the prowl, and yes, a kidnapping.  There's also a duel with bagpipes featuring Peter O'Toole (as Robin MacGregor).  Accents fly fast and furiously and MacArthur manages to maintain his throughout this film.  There's one troublesome death scene but it's done off camera.  The pace is quick, the story is handled in 95 minutes.  The acting is uniformly good.  It's a substantial adventure film that never really got its due (some critics condemned it as `dull').  I'm glad to have found it for my collection.

838897,4,6304293925,"Went into this thinking this would be yet another fluff piece from classic Disney, a bit of harmless fun. Wow, was I taken aback! This was absolutely wonderful!

About as un-Disney as you can get and still carry the brand name.

First, it's spoken entirely in honest Scot and legit Gaelic. There's no 'Americanization' of the characters, so typical of Disney productions; converting a people and their heritage to be palatable for what was then its primary audience. In fact, as I think about it: From a business standpoint, why did they green-light this? It certainly didn't fit in their business model. Very interesting.

Second, death is no boundary. It's depicted without mercy, nor pity - not hallowed or righteous - just the bitterness of killing. The murder of a young boy at the hands of a drunk sailor, whose body is then unceremoniously dumped overboard. Wow. That stark realism alone made this unusual, possibly even unique, as far as I know of Disney films for this period.

Thirdly, we get an unromantic insight into the history of Scotland. Certainly the story of English conquerers and their conquests have been fair game in recent films. But the truth is, even without English interference, the Scots would've been at war with one another. They had battled with one another for centuries before England and continued after. Blood feuds were common and even glorified by both cultures; the enduring enmity between Highland and Lowland Scots has rarely been exposed so vividly as in 'Kidnapped'. Truly amazing.

I'm genuinely stunned.

The adventures of young David Balfour and his journey home to claim his birthright was truly enjoyable. After being tricked by a conniving uncle, young David has to survive being sold into indentured servitude in far away America, a hand-to-hand ship battle for his own freedom, and a terrifying shipwreck on the storm-riddled Scottish coast. Accompanied by Alan Breck Stuart of Clan Stuart, admirably played by Peter Finch, a soldier in the service of an outcast king. I've always appreciated him as an actor, but this incredible performance has elevated him in my eyes. I suspect few could have pulled off the hardened combat veteran who fears no man and bends knee to his King and his king alone.

And you can't help but notice a small bit part played by a very young Peter O'Toole. Fans of the man tend to point to 'Arabia' as his defining role. And while I have respect and appreciation for that work, it's his smaller, less grand performances that I've always enjoyed best. This small role is one of those.

A near five-star rating for me, save for the fact that the audio re-dub wasn't quite in synch and the stock print being washed out. But the story and the sincere performances of every actor involved is worth every penny.

Repeat viewings may be necessary for those accustomed to subtitles, of which this bare bones edition has none.",1306627200,3,2896,4.869918699186992

Another irriation was that the DVD has no special features whatsoever--and it deserves them if this is going to be a DVD that is only available to Disney insiders. Well, I've got it at last. I only wish the House of Mouse had been less thrifty with this release.

  James MacArthur, Peter O'Toole and a few others were still alive when this format was chosen and should have at least appeared to offer their recollections about the film---but nothing!

  I'm vaguely hoping that when Disney finally releases ""CHILD OF GLASS"" on DVD that they will pad the special features with cast and crew input.

839006,5,6304293925,"Originally released in 1960, filmed 10 years after Disney's ""Treasure Island"" (Both are based on books written by Robert Louis Stevenson). This is a grittier more realistic film than Treasure Island, not as flamboyant. Coincidentally, Disney Director Robert Stevenson wrote the screenplay based on the novel but he is not related to the original writer.

Set in 18th centurey Scotland, it features James MacArthur who made 5 other films for Disney as a young man, and later moved on to ""Hawaii 5-O"". The film starts with a plot of a young man finding out he has an estate after his father dies, and when he goes to reclaim it his uncle tries to cheat him out of it. There is a famous scene where the uncle tries to kill the young man by sending up a tower in the dark... with missing stairs. Peter Finch is the Hero that takes him under his wing. They have to battle their way off a ship as cutthroat sailors try to murder them. The movie draws you in, as it is very realistic and loaded with period atmosphere, costumes, sets, and weapons. The British are chasing the Scottish Highlanders all over the countryside which is loaded with friends and traitors, and so they can trust no one. There are many character actors that add to the richness of the film. This film is a rollicking good time, and has intrigue, adventure, and mystery as well. Swordfights and gun battles galore! There are numerous authentic Scottish actors and accents, as it was filmed on location in Scotland. While Disney films that were made in Europe were criticized for being ""too Americanized"" they loved this film and praised both it's authenticity to the original book.

The color is beautiful on this nice clean print, but I do not think the remastered it again for this DVD release.  This film is not for the smallest kids as it does have some scary scenes and some violence. (But keep in mind that the film still takes a strong stand against killing and drinking/gambling. Nice moral lessons without being preachy. The stars fight because they have too, and truly regret having to participate in violence to defend themselves). Keep an eye out for Peter O'Toole in this film.",1207699200,35,2156,4.668421052631579

7867560,2,6304293925,"The movie might be without any question very good with and has an interesting cast (Peter Fench, James MacArthur, and in his debut Peter O'Toole who became later ""Lawrence of Arabia"") - adapted from a famous novel into a ""for children watchable"" adventure movie.

The most dissapointing Thing of this DVD release:
the wrong Picture Format of 4:3 instead of Aspect Ratio:  1.75 :1
Also the Picture Quality isn't really up to date. It could be (for a Major Studio/Label like DISNEY) sharper, cleaner, and also the Colors could be brighter.

For the Picture Format it could be possible, that Disney used for this DVD Version the 2-part cut/Episode which was used for their TV Show ""Disneyland""

Language: only English with English SDH

Also there are NO Bonus-Features and the DVD Menu are kept very simple (with other words: cheap). Sorry Disney - in my mind very poor",1503446400,,866,4.824324324324325
