8234526,4,B000YZG6FE,"I apologize in advance for my rant:)....Tony Hawk is ageless when it comes to his fans. He appeals to all Skateboard fans of all ages. I have 9 and a 5 year old nephews and the other Tony Hawk Secret Skate Tours had some cursing but it was blanked out. This one is slightly shorter but more professionally done. However there is a clip of an interview where a patron at a park says he feels like he just had sex from seeing all of these pros at his local park. This one little clip that in no way made the film made it so that my nephews could not get it for Xmas because they are obviously not ready for ""the talk"" I feel that the editing crew was intelligent enough that they should have known not to put that in there and Tony should have screened it and realized that his demographic of fans is broader than the late teen/early 20 kids that the clip would be met with a chuckle. If you are not a parent and getting this go right ahead....it is worth the money but if you have a kid in the pre ""talk"" age then you might want to skip it or have someone edit it out with their computer or something.",1262044800,,1100,4.0504587155963305
