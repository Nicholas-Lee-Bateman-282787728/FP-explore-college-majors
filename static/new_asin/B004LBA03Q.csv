8434140,2,B004LBA03Q,"This DVD mainly covers the development,production,deployment,and operational maintenance of the P-38.
It has few interesting combat actions other than some strafing. Only three outstanding aces are mentioned
by name (Bong,Zempke. ) and only Bong (top ace with 40 ) is mentioned in any detail. P-38s shot down
Yamamoto's plane,but if that was mentioned, I missed it. Some lack of combat action was probably due
to the design of the P-38 as a high altitude interceptor (and subsequent use as a ground attack plane).
I did like the description of its development,and the details about the main designer Kelly Johnson
who was born near where I live. If you want to read more about Lockheed,get the book Skunk Works.",1336608000,,711,5.033898305084746
