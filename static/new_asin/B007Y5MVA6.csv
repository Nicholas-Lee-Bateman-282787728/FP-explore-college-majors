8523064,4,B007Y5MVA6,"I saw John Mayall with this band in the last year in Austin TX and Napa CA and John himself on the Mark Hummel Sonny Boy Williamson II tour with harmonica players Rick Estrin, Curtis Salgado, James Harman, and (on both on amazing harp and Robert Jr. style guitar) Little Charlie Baty.
Live in London shows off John Mayall's current band with a brilliant no-note-wasted guitar, a playful and powerful Jaco Pastorius-style guitar and a cooking drummer. The only complaint is that the lighting could have been a bit brighter but again, this is the blues.
The best cut (among a consistently strong program) is Room To Move which Mayall told me that he based on Sonny Boy's opening riffs to ""Room To Move.""
Mayall is a treasure (can you believe he and chittlin' circuit kind harp master Bobby Rush are 80? Neither looks over 60! Both played with Sonny Boy.",1390262400,3,851,4.642384105960265
8523065,4,B007Y5MVA6,"I have heard the cd of this concert but not seen the dvd of this 2010 London concert and Mayall was in great form, especially considering that he was 78 when this was recorded. I would like to read a review of the Mayall video not the Carpenters DVD that is linked to this product. Help!!",1378598400,,288,4.160714285714286
