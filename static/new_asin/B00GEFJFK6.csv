8622526,4,B00GEFJFK6,"This is a 2 disc set that has been produced for the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination. Both discs total together about 310 minutes; however there are no closed captions. There are times where the voices and what is being said is not very clear during the film clips from the past. I found myself turning the volume up and down trying to understand everything.  Both discs also contain 2 commercials for Ortho and Liberty Mutual.

Disc one deals with the family itself, explaining the philosophy and wishes of Joe Kennedy, especially not to trust anyone and the deaths and lives of the family and the election of JFK as president. There are many recollections from friends, relatives, and historians as talking heads. Thankfully, since there are so many, they are identified each time they appear. There are lots and lots of photos and newsreels used.

Most of the 2nd disk deals with JFK's death and then Bobby and Edward Kennedy.
 There is a section that goes through all the assassination conspiracies; including a part where whispers and blurry colour negative images are shown for some sort of effect. It also goes into the investigation of the Senate and inquiries of the CIA and their involvement with many other assassinations. There are statements that say who knows if they were involved in Dallas.

This is a DVD that will interest those who want to learn about the Kennedy family and also those who like to look at the assassination conspiracy theories.",1413763200,4,1484,4.873015873015873
