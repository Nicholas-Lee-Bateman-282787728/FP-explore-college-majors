8429596,2,B004HKZFT0,"MY REVIEW HERE WAS DELETED SUDDENLY! This colorized volume is great for fans of the post- 1934 titles ; the casting here of Spanky and the OBNOXIOUS ALFALFA  which is not my cup of coffee.. TITLES OF comedies are NOT LISTED ANYWHERE IN PRODUCT REVIEW and I took the chance on this volume only; only a few starred MY FAVORITE CASTING of the EARLIER SOUND TITLES. (>.>, FOUND ON 3-DISC VOLUME 1.-COLORIZED<) which includes Jackie Cooper and Farina MARYANNE AND OF COURSE WHEEZER!  It's great to add THIS VOLUME 2, though--to ANY COLLECTION OF MOVIES! Timeless and priceless are these--and coming from the COMEDY-ONLY  STUDIOS of HAL ROACH . ALSO NOTE that there are SOME TITLES HERE , in these lil rascals volumes -- which were made POST 1938 when MGM took over with their insidious policy of destroying talents ALREADY PROVEN-- literally- ALMOST DESTROYING  the careers OF THESE MASTERS, contracting them to star in HORRIBLE VEHICLES FOR- LAUREL & HARDY. THE MARX BROS, BUSTER KEATON.> beautiful people with their respective talents for comedy offered seemed IGNORED --  following the ROAR OF THAT LION....  !!! ..>>>> ANYWAY; NOT COLORIZED-- is the COMPLETE SET of the HAL ROACH SOUND ORIGINALS /OUR GANG (LIL RASCALS)--and  all  true fans should  not be without!!  ( and I wish they would have COLORIZED ALL OF THEM! )  >>However aside my rating I found  SEVERAL CLASSIC EARLIER -MADE TITLES  IN THIS VOLUME  and they ARE LISTED IN THE SECOND ROW OF TITLES WHICH ARE ON THE BACK COVER .( which naturally cannot be seen here in the product-review)THOSE  WITH PETE THE POOCH includes ""THE POOCH"",  and ""FOR PETE'S SAKE""...ALSO HAS THE CUTE ""FOLLIES OF 1938"" which I believe was nearly at the END of the MAGIC THAT WAS THERE IN THE Hal Roach titles,  PRIOR 1938..",1501286400,,1761,4.816666666666666
8429597,5,B004HKZFT0,My grandchildren loved this.  I like finding old movies to show my 10 & 8 year old grandchildren.  They end up enjoying them after the quit moaning about old movies.,1400630400,,165,4.466666666666667
8429598,5,B004HKZFT0,I am already a huge fan of Spanky and the gang so was thrilled when I learned this DVD came out in color!! These guys were my after school treat so watching this brought back a lot of happy family memories. I recommend this too for the kids in your life--they will get a kick out of it!,1395619200,,286,3.9482758620689653
8429599,1,B004HKZFT0,"I so looked forward to receiving these DVD's, 1 of the DVD's won't play and the other only played half way through before skipping and cutting off.  I thought maybe just maybe it was my player, but I tried it on another machine and it did the same thing.  Super disappointed!  I will be returning these!",1388966400,,303,4.375
8429600,5,B004HKZFT0,"I have over 50 episodes of The Little Rascals on DVD. I am pleased to get the new color releases of them.
Thanks again for your excellent service.",1378944000,,146,4.25
8429601,3,B004HKZFT0,"Brought back memories. My three little grandchildren could not get over how kids were treated then. Spankings, ran around alone day and night and had more freedom than kids have today. Things like playing outside without supervision.",1358985600,,233,5.324324324324325
8429602,5,B004HKZFT0,"It was nice to see these old films of the Little Rascals in color. It, of course, makes it more viewable for the younger generation.
However, in color or black and white these films bring back a lot of memories and hope they do the same in the future for my grandchildren.
