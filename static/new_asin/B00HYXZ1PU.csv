6243405,5,B00HYXZ1PU,Love Green Acres.,1413331200,2,17,5.0
6243406,2,B00HYXZ1PU,"This was one of the more disappointing purchases I have made recently.  The Green Acres movie was okay in quality, not the acting, the transfer to DVD.  However, The Gilligan's Island movie is a real disappointment.  From the beginning I knew the quality was bad. It had so many sparkles in the opening scenes that it was very hard to watch.  I turned it off & have not made my way back to it yet.  If your a nostalgia buff, then try to see these 2 movies if you never have, otherwise wait for a better copy to come out.",1411084800,5,520,4.16
6243407,5,B00HYXZ1PU,"2 great movies for a terrific price! Green Acres is the place to be, farm living is the life for me! (After a 3 hour tour of course!)",1406332800,,133,3.7857142857142856
6243408,5,B00HYXZ1PU,"This is a good set if you are a Green Acres and Gilligan's Island fan.  This is two DVD's instead of one. Green Acres had all of the original cast and so did Gilligan, except Ginger was played by someone else.  Still good movies for classic TV fans.  Great price too.",1402185600,2,267,4.196078431372549

6243410,3,B00HYXZ1PU,Okay...if you liked Green Acres then you'll probably enjoy this as much for seeing the original characters as anything else!,1443484800,,124,5.25

6243415,4,B00HYXZ1PU,"watched as a kid
never saw either ending...
was good  to see how the series ended.",1423180800,,82,4.125
6243416,4,B00HYXZ1PU,If you are a big fan of either of these shows you need this combo pack.  The picture quality of the Gilligan movie is not good for the first few minutes but the rest is fine.  The Green Acres picture quality is good.  These movies both suffer from time extension fatigue.  In the half hour format these shows are both crazy but at an hour and a half a lot of that craziness gets lost in the plot.  It is nice to see old friends again.  Good deal if you like these shows.,1423094400,4,470,4.0

8637328,5,B00HYXZ1PU,"The Gilligan's Island movie was so-so, I'd seen it before on TV. But the Green Acres episode is just great. I didn't realize how long ago the series was made and that Eva Gabor and Eddie Albert had been dead for so long. They had such an amazing chemistry and timing, not to mention the clever writing. Just great to see the ""final"" episode of that series.",1487548800,2,356,4.3283582089552235

8637335,1,B00HYXZ1PU,Mill Creek (the quality is much much worse then a 20 year old VHS that was in rental)  It is hard to believe this can be sold.,1459900800,,126,3.6666666666666665
