2420651,5,B000BJS4UI,I love The Cosby Show. It's so funny and not only that it's very family friendly. You can absolutely enjoy it with your kids with any worries. I can't wait for Season 3.,1156291200,,169,4.151515151515151
2420652,5,B000BJS4UI,"just like season 1, the huxtable family has put together a great compilation of episodes.  Good old fassioned, clean humor.  Great to watch over and over.",1152748800,2,154,4.884615384615385
2420653,5,B000BJS4UI,"""NOW WE'RE TALKING,GREAT IDEA"" WERE THE WORDS OF CLAIRE HUXTABLE ON ""CLAIRE'S SISTER"" ONE OF MY FAVORITE EPISODES CAUSE THE WIVES WERE MAKING FUN OF THEIR HUSBANDS & BECAUSE THIS SEASON IS UNCUT,NOT LIKE THE FIRST SEASON THAT WAS CUT!!

I HOPE YHAT ALL OF THE COSBY SHOWS DVD SEASONS ARE RELEASE UNCUT & NOT CUT LIKE THE FIRST SEASON,THOUGH I BOUGHT IT TOO FOR THE LOVE OF THE SHOW!!!",1151712000,,384,4.485714285714286
2420654,5,B000BJS4UI,"If for none other than ""Happy Anniversary"" this is The Cosby Show at its very best. The lip-syncing is superb of the Ray Charles classic ""Night Time Is The Right Time."" Especially Rudy. That particular segment is also memorable for the last scene with its, ""just your feet now, just your feet."" And ""A Touch of Wonder"" ranks right there with it, Mr. Stevie Wonder and ""Robert"" ""Jammin' On The One"" ""I Don't Know What To Say"" ""Baby, Baby, Baby"" are as fresh as the original broadcast. But ""The Juicer"" ""The First Day Of School"" ""The Dentist"" ""The Auction"" ""Theo and Cockroach"" ""Full House"" ""The Card Game"" and many more, bring back the fondest memories of the best season also. Television Perfection.",1147392000,4,699,4.737704918032787
2420655,5,B000BJS4UI,"Good 'ol Bill Cosby! He always brings a smile to my face! This season had a lot of great episodes. ""Denise Drives"" is my favorite; followed by ""Rudy Suits Up"" and ""The Dentist"" with the late great Danny Kaye in his last TV performance. ""The Card Game"" is also another great one. There are more special features this season also. Can't wait for season three!",1142726400,5,357,4.507692307692308
2420656,5,B000BJS4UI,"The Cosby Show season 2 DVDs are indeed uncut.  I bought them today.  I watched episode 16 ""The Dentist"" from an old recording I have of the syndicated version, then watched the same episode on the new DVDs.  There is additional material in the DVD episode.  Clair argues with Theo about the new highrise being built, as she is upset about their water usage.  Cliff reveals that Theo is interested because he heard 55 stewardesses would be moving into the highrise.  Also, Dr. Burns (played by Danny Kaye) tells two jokes with the big teeth model instead of one.  This puts the episode run time at 23:39 instead of 22 minutes for the sydicated version.

This is the only episode I have compared.  I expect the others to be uncut as well.  Kudos to Urbanworks for doing justice to the best sitcom ever.",1142640000,26,801,4.538461538461538
2420657,5,B000BJS4UI,"A solid and very enjoyable second season that is much better and funnier than the first, but not the best season of the series. The second season has an assortment of great episodes among the good episodes though none of the episodes from this season are bad. It includes the family lip synching to Ray Charles' classic tune ""The Night Time Is The Right Time"" (the ""Happy Anniversary"" episode), one of the most memorable moments from the entire series. The first appearance of Elvin as Sondra's boyfriend (future husband) in the episode ""Cliff In Love"". I also can't help but laugh every time Rudy's friend Peter appears in an episode, just the expressions on his face (""The Dentist"" episode), and the way he runs out of a room when there's trouble (""The Juicer"" episode) cracks me up. Theo's best buddy and partner in rhymes, Cockaroach (Carl Anthony Payne III), makes his first appearance in ""Theo And Cockaroach"". Stevie Wonder guest stars in an episode, inviting the family to the recording studio (the episode ""A Touch Of Wonder""). My favorite episode from this season is hands down ""Theo's Holiday"" when eveyone in the Huxtable house teaches Theo a harsh but funny lesson about what it's like to live in 'the real world'. This episode is still hilarious after many repeated viewings.
""The Cosby Show"" is my favorite family comedy series. Though it's not outrageous like ""Married...With Children"" or ""Roseanne"", my second and third favorite family centered comedy series, it is not as sweet and sentimental as ""Full House"" or ""Family Matters"". It's right in the middle, dealing with real situations of adolescence and family affairs and still being genuinely funny. I grew up watching ""The Cosby Show"" and also I grew up watching ""Married...With Children"", and I liked having that contrasting view of family life presented on tv. Whereas ""Married..."" showed us the low class family lifestyle, ""Cosby"" showed us the upper class family lifestyle, and both were funny and seperately identified with by many different families. Dr. Heithcliff Huxtable is a great father because he taught his children lessons in life, not the clean cut way Ward Cleaver did on ""Leave It To Beaver"" and not the cynical way Al Bundy did on ""Married...With Children"", but his way that was original and clever, sometimes harsh but always caring. Clair Huxtable is the best tv mom of all-time in my opinion. The most outrageous tv mom would be Marie Barone in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" or Peg Bundy in ""Married...With Children"", but the best tv mom is definitely Mrs. Huxtable. She's intelligent, beautiful, successful, funny, strong, loving, and caring. Then there are the Cosby kids, and I liked all of them. Sondra was the oldest and the most cerebral and complex character, especially her rocky relationship with future husband Elvin (the episode ""Cliff In Love"" and ""Full House""). It was definitely Denise who had the most responsibilites of the Cosby kids left in the household (the episode ""Denise Drives"" and ""Denise's Decision""), being the oldest of the the kids left in the house. Theo and Vanessa, being the teens of the family, made most of the mistakes and had most of the lessons being taught to them for those mistakes (the episodes ""Vanessa's Bad Grade"", ""Mrs. Westlake"" and ""Theo And The Older Woman""). Rudy was smart for a child her age as well as cute (""Rudy Suits Up"" and ""Happy Anniversary""), but in later seasons, Olivia (Raven Simone) was the smartest and most adorable little girl in tv history (far and away more than the Olsen twins were on Full House, plus she is a very beautiful woman now which I can't say at all for Mary-Kate and Ashley).
I highly recommend buying the second season of ""The Cosby Show"" instead of watching the re-runs on Nick At Nite or TBS in the morning. It is definitely worth it to be apart of the best tv family.",1141516800,14,3844,4.870229007633588
2420658,5,B000BJS4UI,"Another great season of this Giant show.  If you like season 1(or 3), you'll like this too.

There's a bunch of classic episodes here:

49th anniversary

Theo's teacher: Ms Westlake

Cliff(Cosby) runs in a rely race competition. guest: Valerie Brisco-Hooks

Stevie Wonder guest stars, and sings

Peter: the kid who never said anything-funnier than you'd think

Denise gets her driver's license

Good classic Family stuff!",1139616000,11,421,5.3538461538461535
2420659,5,B000BJS4UI,"First and foremost, the publisher has promised that this DVD set will come with the original, uncut editions instead of the crappy syndicated versions they used in the first season.

So, with a decent release, this is a must for Cosby fans, given that this is one of the best seasons. Obviously the writers still had a lot of ideas, the kids were young and funny...

This is the first season Sabrina Leauf joins the regular staff as Sondra. There's also some interesting guest stars, such as Robin Givens, Sonia Braga, Stevie Wonder or Tanya Wright.

Really, don't miss this boxset if you are a fan. And if you are buying for a fan, this is a great gift.",1131667200,58,654,4.4789915966386555
2420660,5,B000BJS4UI,"Well,THE COSBY SHOW finished its first season at #3 in the Nielsen ratings. Here's where it finishes at #1(for this season) and the following four. This season has a new opening montage with the cast moving in rhythm,or dancing. Just watch Clair(Phylicia Ayers Allen) shake her ass when she moves! Cliff(Bill Cosby) just moves his head all about. Sabrina LeBeauf as the oldest Huxtable daughter Sondra,is now a regular cast member. LeBeauf first appeared in the Season 1 episode BON JOUR SONDRA. That was the beginning of her recurring role. The youngest Huxtable daughter Rudith,or Rudy(Keshia Knight Pulliam),just jumps up and down just like any 6-year-old would. Denise(Lisa Bonet) ""bumps off"" Cliff,while dancing. In the first episode,THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL,which premiered September 26,1985,Denise,Vanessa(Tempest Bledsoe),Theo(Malcolm Jamal Warner) and Rudy prepare for their first day of school. Rudy's was humiliating because she was teased by a classmate by making fun of her name. He called her ""Rudy Huckleberry"". Other highlights this season include Denise getting her drivers' license,Theo developing a crush on one of Denise's female classmates,Rudy and her white friend Peter Chiara making a mess in the Huxtables' kitchen with a new juicing machine that Cliff purchased,Cliff's parents Russell(Earle Hyman,recurring) and Anna(Clarice Taylor,recurring) celebrating their 49th wedding anniversary. While NIGHT TIME IS THE RIGHT TIME performed by the late Ray Charles is playing,the Huxtables pretend they're performing the song themselves. Get a load of Rudy belting out ""BAY BAY"" while the other Huxtable women,with their backs to the camera(s),sway and move their arms. Theo and Denise are in an auto accident with a limousine carrying R&B legend Stevie Wonder. Stevie invites the Huxtables to one of his recording sessions. He and Clair do a short rendition of Stevie's 1984 hit I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU. Also,Geoffrey Owens and Joseph C. Phillips make their first appearances on TCS. Owens is Elvin Tibidaux,Sondra's boyfriend,whom she met at Princeton University,where she still is at this season. Elvin appeared recurringly this season,the next,and became a regular from season 4 to 8(the last). Phillips guest-starred in one episode as a date for Sondra. In that very episode,which was Owens' inaugural episode as well,Sondra and Elvin had broken up after she was stood up by him repeatedly. Eventually,they'd reconcile. Phillips joined the TCS cast in 1989 as navy Lieutenant Martin Kendall who would become Denise's husband. Also,the Huxtables host a Halloween party for Rudy and her friends(aired October 31,1985,perfect timing!) In the season finale,aired May 8,1986,Denise announces her plan to attend Hillman College upon high school graduation(she was a high school senior this season while Theo was a sophomore). Also,Theo and his buddy Walter ""Cockroach"" Bradley,a recurring character played by Carl Anthony Payne II,are bombarded with snowballs thrown by young children. I visited TCS set in December 1985 while on a field trip to NBC Studios in New York City. Unfortunately,I never met Cosby or any other of the cast. They must have been off that week. We'll be anxiously awaiting the Season 3 set.",1127865600,6,3238,5.452191235059761

2420758,1,B000BJS4UI,"""The Cosby Show"" was praised for it's ""wholesomeness, great role models for African Americans"" during a decade of Eddie Murphy type comedy, etc. But none of that makes this a good, much less great show. This has all the appeal of ""Full House,' minus the ""You got it dudes."" So it is worthy of sitting the kiddies in front of the TV to watch. How any adult could stomach it, especially in hindsight amazes me to this day. It's full of ""Awwwww"" type cutesiness, endless pounding of ad-nauseum scholastical preachiness, and feel good fashion statements, as it were. All of which perfectly fits the mold of ""The Brady Bunch."" In fact, this show is the Brady Bunch of the 1980s (compare the 2 series and prove me wrong). It's a meandering, pandering, suck up of a show that is funny only to those who are laughing before the show even begins. It typifies the other over rated, unfunny sitcoms of the 80s that were celebrated because TV had to hand out awards to someone. So why not hand it to the wholesome Huxtables, no matter how hammy, saccharine, predictable, redundant and horribly written and acted it is. This is the most over rated ""comedy"" in the history of TV. Don't waste your time or money. You want the best Cosby comedy ever with lessons and morals to boot, buy the ""Fat Albert"" cartoon series. It was actually funny. This one is just plain corny, predictable, sappy, and so sweet it hurts your teeth. And Phylicia Rashad brings to TV the most annoying character since Granny Clampet of ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The fact that this show was number one for so long is an indictment of how much garbage TV is able to cram down viewers throats- a testament to P.T. Barnum's ""there's a sucker born every minute."" Remember, ""Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" too were huge ratings winners. So much for ratings.",1373328000,,1813,4.633540372670807

2420777,5,B000BJS4UI,The Cosby show is a must for any family. It's timeless humor keeps everyone laughing of all generations.  Today's sitcoms really rely on immoral humor that just lacks the raw values of everyday life.

So what happens is that one of the DVD's is always subject to be scratched. And yes something is wrong with DVD #1. It will not play disc #1 properly. The second show on that DVD get's stuck and will not play.

I will try to get this fix with the company but the best thing to do is to get a better set.",1343779200,3,431,3.5851063829787235
2420784,5,B000BJS4UI,"My husband and I were newly married back in 1984 when this series first aired. Thursday nights were definitely the ""must see"" TV people talk about primarily due to this show. We rarely missed an episode and when we weren't going to be home, we recorded it on our VCR (remember those?).

Fast forward many years and with a daughter added to our family, we bought these in 2007 and watched the first three seasons again.  Just a few weeks ago, we pulled out season 1 and laughed our way through it.  We kept going and ended up finishing Season 2 last night.  My daughter is 17, my husband 55, and I am 50 -- a wide range of ages and yet all of us are laughing from beginning to end and appreciating what a comic genius Bill Cosby is. The cast is incredible, the characters full of quirks and personality, the writing is stupendous.

If you haven't seen these before and are looking for good, clean fun give them a try. If you saw these years ago, give them another go since this is definitely a series that has stood the test of time.",1335830400,,1032,4.271794871794872
2420785,5,B000BJS4UI,"We just purchased season two as we have season one and love this T.V. series, its clean fun and funny! Great for family laughs! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.

Looks like that is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like the Cosby show!

While shopping on Amazon we selected the used copy we wanted and while still shopping someone else purchased the copy we had in our cart so we lost that copy and had to select another copy that cost more. I guess that goes to show how great this show is, everyone is grabbing copies of it.(which is good, because this should show producers that people really want to watch).

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find a used copy for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it! (I even have the Cosby Show set as one of my ring tones on my cell phone!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family  fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show! This show could even go for parental education!

Happy viewing!

2420788,2,B000BJS4UI,I was very disappointed when I opened this video. There was no episode guide included as there normally would be. There is no way to know what is on each disc without putting it in the dvd player. There is not a list on the cover or included inside.

2420790,5,B000BJS4UI,My husband I have been looking for some decent tv shows to watch with our 8 yr old son.  We stumbled on the Cosby show one night on TV Land and my son laughed through the whole show.  We bought the dvd to watch it together when there is nothing on TV to watch (which is frequently) and we laugh at ech episode.  I forgot how good this show was and how much I enjoyed it when it was on TV.  It's a great dvd for the whole family!,1285718400,,428,3.7752808988764044

There is no show on TV today that matches the humor and family friendliness of this series.  Bill Cosby proved that humor does not have to be crude and base to be funny.  Season 2 is filled with tear filled laughter.",1269043200,,346,3.971014492753623
2420793,5,B000BJS4UI,"I cannot say why it is that I haven't reviewed this sooner but I fully intended to review all the Cosby Show seasons at one time or another. If I recall I've only reviewed the last three seasons so I really need to get working on the first five. So I'll present them starting now and in no particular order. The main reason I'm reviewing this now is because this was the season I first saw The Cosby Show during it's first run. Now this is a great season over-all but this season reminds me of one thing:RUDY RUDY RUDY!!!!Somehow or other Rudy tended to be kind of a star of this season of the show. There are in fact two episodes little Keisha Knight Pulliam introduces the episodes as being ""for you kids,but grown ups can watch too"". One of these I remember of course all too well is ""The Dentist"",in which Rudy's tacitern friend Peter doesn't want to go to the dentist and winds up with both of them being entertained by the wildly madcap Danny Kaye. I loved the episode at that time and still find it hugely entertaining since I am more attuned now to Kaye's humor than the kids reactions to him. Another thing I like about this season is that the kids,even the older ones such as Denise and such are still kids and not dealing with all the ironies and reality checks that made for some of the more awkward moments,for Huxtable parents AND kids in later seasons. In fact a great episode of this season revolves around Denise haggling with her dad over buying a car. Even if there's a rather tense scene where she does challange her parents authority over the issue it never hangs a dark cloud over the rest of the show. Some of the best episodes this season involve Theo and the ""creature teacher"" Mrs. Westlake,who turns out to be a very well meaning and caring teacher once Theo and Cockroach find out what makes her tick (especially after a hilareous visit from her and her husband to the Huxtable home). Of course I have three favorite episodes that stand out as classics of this season and the whole show in general here and all involve music in some way. One of my favorite characters in this show is Slide Hampton as Cliff's rather Russell. I have to agree with all the classic TV moment shows I've seen that ""Happy Anniversary"" is one of the ALL TIME great Cosby moments,featuring the kids miming to Ray Charles' ""Nightime Is The Right Time"" with Rudy passionately pretending to belt out ""BAAAABY!!!"". This goes beyond cute to me-the kid has some SOUL! ""Play It Again,Russell"" is a story about the elder Huxtable losing and finding his musician mojo and featuring his ""band"" The Jazz Caravan featuring big name jazz musicians such as Jimmy & Percy Heath,Tito Puente,Eric Gale and Art Blakey. NEVER before (or since) The Cosby Show have I ever seen an American primetime sitcom that so openly and happily flaunted the love and enjoyable qualities of jazz. It really bought out the music should (and could) be for everyone to get into just as with The Cosby Show. Of course this has ""A Sense Of Wonder""-we start with Theo and Dennise getting run into by Stevie Wonder's limo and culminates in Stevie inviting the family to a jam session where he records them for a mix tape and also treats us to a really funny speech from Theo on the ""advantages"" of being a musician,that is told from a 14 year old's point of view. To me this represents The Cosby Show's finest period,before the storylines became so involved with preachiness or the generation gap. Those were relevent points and important for this show. But it's hard not to find this seasons potent but still intellectually relevent stories highly entertaining.",1267488000,,3626,4.571428571428571

2420795,5,B000BJS4UI,"Even though the Cosby Show is around 20 years old, it's still one of the best sit-coms ever. Bill Cosby is hilarious - a comic genius. His reactions to events are so spontaneous and creative. I haven't seen another comic quite like him. Best of all, the show's plots are both family-friendly and funny. Unlike modern sit-coms, the characters don't curse and talk about sex every other scene. Rather the episodes are centered around family dramas that are realistic but always resolved well. The cast includes everybody from Phylicia Rashad as the tough and very intelligent Mrs. Huxtable, to the young and adorable Rudy. This makes the show accessible to a wide range of audiences. I am glad these finally came out on DVD. I hope one day to share this treasure with my children.",1263168000,,778,4.770370370370371

And the amazing thing is, we never have to worry about what they are seeing. It's simply pure comedy, joy in the family and happiness! No bad stuff, like the ones kids are shown on TV these days!

Let me say that while I am a fan of hardcore comedy like Dave Chappelle, Eddie Murphy and the late Richard Pryor, The Cosby Show is a classic and shows you don't need adult humor to have a funny show!

Episodes include the classic ""Anniversary"" one where the family 'sings' Night & Day for the grandparents and the one where Vanessa and Denise get into a fight on the show! Plus other funny moments that make you laugh and think at the same time. As a friend at work says, they don't make shows like this anymore.

I understand they've put out all 8 seasons in one pack but if only want one season and can't decide, may I recommend this season! It is classic TV!",1241740800,,790,4.225165562913907

The Cosby Show - Season 2 is just as great as season 1, possibly even better! This tv series is very funny and witty! It is also educational for both parents and children, concerning parenting and teaching children what's right and wrong and what is important in life.

Some of my favorite episodes in this season are: Halloween: where Vanessa falls in love at a party.  Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous as Tina Turner!, Clair's toe: Clair breaks her toe and she and Cliff have a ""smooth"" contest.  Denise's Decision:  Denise finally picks a college.  This DVD includes bloopers and an interview with the director.  Definitely worth buying!",1218153600,,521,4.786516853932584
2420807,5,B000BJS4UI,"The Cosby Show is a really funny show.  As an almost 40 year old woman, I still get a kick out of watching this show.  I watched it when it was on tv originally and I still laugh just as much, if not more, as I did back then.  This show is good for the whole family with clean comedy.  Bill Cosby is funny, of course, but I think that Phylicia Rashad is hysterical.  She portrays a strong, independent woman yet cares very much about her family and their well being.  I think that this is a timeless classic comedy.  Even in the midst of the comedy, there are still lessons that can be learned.  Again, I definitely would suggest this for the whole family.",1216944000,,656,4.192
2420808,5,B000BJS4UI,"The Cosby Show had a fantastic first season but I find season two to be an improvement. First of all, I enjoyed season two's theme song much more than the original and it's hysterical seeing Bill Cosby dancing...well trying to dance. Not only was season two's theme song more enjoyable, Bill and Phylicia's chemistry got even better.  And Elvin Tibideaux (played by Geoffrey Owens) became a recurring character. The Cosby Show season two was also the start of a five year era of having the number one Nielson Ratings.  But not only was the Cosby Show season two an improvement over season one, so is the DVD release. None of the episodes are edited like they were an season one and it's nice to know that Urban Works gave season two proper treatment. And there are some nice bonus features included with season two, Jay Sandrich does a commentary for ""Denise's Friend"" and there is an interview with Jay as well. The last two are Cliff's Parenting Tips which just features clips from episodes of the series, and last of all some hilarious bloopers.

I love the episode ""Full House"" which is from season two, Cliff just wants to find a place to read his newspaper but the kids are in every room of the house. I love this episode because I live in a small house and it can drive me nuts when I just can't have some privacy. Oh and I love ""Theo's Holiday"", I must have watched it at least ten times since I've got the set.  Oh yeah, speaking of episode descriptions, the only disappointment that I could think of for this set are the episode listings, season two lists each episodes title but there are no episode description, but this is just a minor complaint. Well since some people might not know which episodes are included on this set I will list them below.

2420809,5,B000BJS4UI,"It's the second season of The Cosby Show.  All the classic laughs of the first season are still afresh in everyone's minds.  We watch Rudy, Vanessa and Theo have misadventures with their lives, education and - household appliances.  Denise finishes high school and learns to drive.  [Witness Dr. Huxtable immitating her car of choice: ""I pressed down on the gas, and - you think I'm lying - the car said, 'What?'""

We also witness Sabrina Le Bauf becoming a series regular as Sondra Huxtable and the introduction of her future husband, Elvin Tibbadeaux (performed by Geoffrey Owens), the macho male cheuvanist that Sondra adores.  (Can you sing, ""The flowers have died; there is no morning dew; the crickets know no love songs, and I feel so blue!"" with me?)

The only other section of this set that needs additional mentioning is ""Full House"" when Denise's date, Eddie who sings along with a music video, ""Sponji Reggae"" by Black Uhura.",1215648000,,937,4.855345911949685
2420810,5,B000BJS4UI,"I personally love this DVD set. It has many great unforgetable episodes. For instance, there is the Stevie wonder episode, the hilarious episode where Theo is taught what it's really like to be on your own in the real world, the episode with Denise and Vanessa fighting over a sweater, and many more. This DVD set also includes bloopers and Cliff's parenting tips.",1205107200,,364,4.7936507936507935

They have watched it over and over again . . . it has a permanent place in our DVD player.  An added bonus - it's totally entertaining for parents as well.  Brings back great memories.  A couple of the shows seem to drag a little bit but they are fun to watch just the same.  Great addition to any DVD library.,1199750400,,425,4.121951219512195
2420814,4,B000BJS4UI,"I bought this product along with the other three seasons off amazon because with their amazing prices you certainly can't go wrong. In the stores they sell for twice (some times triple) times the prices sold on amazon.

I can say proudly that I do not regret getting these dvds for one second because the laughter keeps coming. The different actors have this special bond which makes them really stand out like a true family that at many times you forget that they're actors playing roles.

There is really nothing negative I have to say about this DVD set except for the lay out. The DVD's just like some of the fresh prince seasons, lay on top of each other. Where Disc 1 lays on Disc 2 and Disc 3 lays on Disc 4.

This layout is my least favorite because the DVD's aren't secure on the plastic and the dvds tend to slip out which puts them in risk of getting damaged.

Other than the lay out of the DVD's every thing else concerning this season is a positive.

It would've gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor lay out for the DVDs.",1191456000,,1038,4.275510204081633

2420816,1,B000BJS4UI,"C'mon ""Cosby Police."" You know who you are. The ones who are compelled to silent my reviews of ""The Great Cosby Show,"" because I dare to call it as I see it. So...I find it amusing that my original review of this drek of a program was muted- I'm sure there's some PC monitors who found it offensive that anyone dared to diss the great Cosby Show. That was actually part of the point of my original review. It was praised for it's ""wholesomeness, great role models for African Americans"" during a decade of Eddie Murphy type comedy, etc. But none of that makes this a good, much less great show. This has all the appeal of ""Full House,' minus the ""You got it dudes."" So it is worthy of sitting the kiddies in front of the TV to watch. How any adult could stomach it, especially in hindsight amazes me to this day. It's full of ""Awwwww"" type cutesiness, endless pounding of ad-nauseum scholastical preachiness, and feel good fashion statements, as it were. All of which perfectly fits the mold of ""The Brady Bunch."" In fact, this show is the Brady Bunch of the 1980s (compare the 2 series and prove me wrong). It's a meandering, pandering, suck up of a show that is funny only to those who are laughing before the show even begins. It typifies the other over rated, unfunny sitcoms of the 80s that were celebrated because TV had to hand out awards to someone. So why not hand it to the wholesome Huxtables, no matter how hammy, saccharine, predictable, redundant and horribly written and acted it is. This is the most over rated ""comedy"" in the history of TV. Don't waste your time or money. You want the best Cosby comedy ever with lessons and morals to boot, buy the ""Fat Albert"" cartoon series. It was actually funny. This one is just plain corny, predictable,  sappy, and so sweet it hurts your teeth. And Phylicia Rashad brings to TV the most annoying character since Granny Clampet of  ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The fact that this show was number one for so long is an indictment of how much garbage TV is able to cram down viewers throats- a testament to P.T. Barnum's ""there's a sucker born every minute."" Remember, ""Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" too were huge ratings winners. So much for ratings.",1187654400,2,2207,4.542713567839196

2420825,5,B000BJS4UI,The best of situation comedy peaked with the advent of the Cosby Show. It proved that the greatest comedy isn't distasteful nor off color. These episodes are to be and most certainly will be cherished for years to come.,1169856000,,219,4.641025641025641

2420828,5,B000BJS4UI,I believe that season two is by far the pinnacle of Cosby's career.  What started out as a review of his comedic writings in season 1 has matured and come to the fullness of the real life family of actors that made up the Huxtable family.  Few shows have delighted my heart the way this show has and season two is top notch viewing.  I'd buy it again and again!,1168473600,,361,4.128571428571429

Although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later.  Regardless, this is a great collection and a must for Cosby fans.",1168387200,,485,4.25

The Cosbys are a family that respect and love each other.  They also understand that mistakes can be made without it being a life sentence, and you can learn from them and go on.

The ""I Have A Dream"" show where the family gathers around the TV to watch Martin Luther Kings' speech still brings me to tears. Watching the looks on all their faces is mesmerizing",1162512000,4,552,4.310679611650485

The good news, however, is that all future seasons of The Cosby Show, including this one, will be uncut.

So, now that we can rest assured that we will never again see syndicated Cosby on DVD, this show is a must have.  Theo's smart remarks that bring about Cliff's smart comebacks are hysterical to see.  My favorite episodes from this set are ""The First Day of School"" and ""Mrs. Westlake.""
