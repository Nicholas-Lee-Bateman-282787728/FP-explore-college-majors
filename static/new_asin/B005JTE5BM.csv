Teutonic ancestors did practice meditation as Michael William Denny points out in the DVD. The DVD covers a variety of energy practices that allows one to get in touch with the great Gods, Goddesses, and also our own innate mystical power. You will learn ways to connect with the great Goddess Hulda or Holle, Thor, Freya, Freyr, Nerthuz, Sunna, Ing, and Woden (Odin). In addition you get to contact the mystical Runes and empower yourself through variations in the exercises to include Runic chanting. My first time trying these techniques was very informal to simply get the feel of them. Even though it was informal I was surging with energy afterwards. Practicing the techniques formally produced much more energy. So much so I had to ground the energy thoroughly due to the intensity. These techniques also allows the monkey mind (thoughts, excessive thinking)to slow down so that you can connect with your body and the energy flowing from within and from the Deities. I look forward to getting all of the DVDs to complete the series and work through them in my day to day life.",1369526400,,1172,4.835820895522388

There is some interesting and good information in it. I enjoyed it, and although I thought it was a little pricy, did not regret my purchase. This is a series, and I intend to explore the other titles at a later date.",1355875200,,433,4.425
8475986,5,B005JTE5BM,The exercises on this video have brought me closer to the gods of my ancestors. The efficacy of the practices themselves rival the most powerful practices in Yoga or Qigong. I especially enjoyed the explanation of the ING Rune. Mr. Denney has discovered a powerful way to integrate this Rune on a psychic and energetic level. A+,1321401600,,328,4.771929824561403
