8748684,5,B016NUSHMI,This DVD is great. I have been searching for a DVD to teach my kids Polish and this is exactly what I needed. The teaching method in this DVD is engaging and simple for the little ones to follow. The main topic of this DVD is food. I look forward to the release of other topics!,1453593600,,278,3.982142857142857

Lesson is not too long so toddlers don't get bored and they manage to pay attention till the end. Great idea to make quizzes - children participate actively in lesson. I'm looking forward for next lessons! Highly recommended!",1452902400,,335,5.109090909090909
