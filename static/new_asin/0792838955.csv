141406,5,0792838955,"The Film:
Fiddler on the Roof is based on the tales of Russian Jewish life written by Shalom Alechem in the 1800s, with music scored by John Williams.  Directed by Norman Jewison, it's widely acknowledged to be one of the best musicals ever made.  Tevye, played by the famous jewish actor Topol, lives in the enclave of Anatevka with his wife and _6_ daughters.  Insulated & protected by their Orthodox traditions, Tevye must face, with a poignant combination of humor, sorrow and acceptance, the marriage of his three eldest daughters in a series of increasingly unacceptable unions.  How far can tradition be bent and still maintain the center of his family and his community's existence?  Do we place tradition over family?  Oswald Morris' beautiful cinematography and Jewison's compelling film-making pursue these questions both for the residents of Anatevka and for us in our ever-changing worlds.
The DVD:
A marvel, this film has never looked or sounded better for home viewing - a remixed Dolby 5.1 soundtrack and crystal-clear picture on a double-layer disc make this a contribution to your film library you'll not regret.  Jewison & Topol's commmentary give you some ideas behind the making of the film, what the director was trying to achieve, and how Topol moved his character from stage to screen.  Director's full use of the 70mm aspect ratio demands the anamorphic widescreen format used in this printing.",979171200,222,1419,5.086206896551724
141407,5,0792838955,"I was two when ""Fiddler"" made its initial theatrical run, so needless to say I missed it.  Recently, my father-in-law lent my wife and I his VHS copy.  To be honest, I didn't want to see it.  After all, it starred that guy from Flash Gordon!  Well, at my wife's insistence, I watched the opening sequence (the song ""Tradition"") and I was hooked.  Such life!  Such humor!
Later, as a gift, I bought my wife the DVD that we've played again and again.  The transfer is wonderful; the sound is clear and deep.  This DVD is a must for any collector of fine cinema, or musical theatre.
Oh, and as for ""that guy from Flash Gordon"", Topol gives the definitive performance of Tevye.  Watch this DVD and marvel how well it captures his command performance.",972864000,8,746,4.466666666666667
141408,5,0792838955,"""Fiddler on the Roof"" is my all-time favorite musical, both on the stage and on film.  This is a story of tradition, love and marriage in a Jewish family living in the face of persecution in Tsarist Russia at the  beginning of the 20th century.  Based on the 19th century stories of Sholom  Alechem, it tells of  how Tevye, a poor Jewish dairyman, Golde, his  somewhat shrewish wife, and their five unmarried daughters face their  dreams amidst the reality of rampant anti-semitism.  Director Norman  Jewison's treatment of this story is wonderfully sensitive.  The cast -  especially Topol as Tevye (nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for  this role) and  Norma Crane as Golde - bring  to life all the strength of  character, the comedy, and the poignant tragedy of life in the village of  Anatevka.  The music and choreography are  sheer magic throughout!  ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is a timeless classic, and should not be  missed.",958867200,49,936,4.840764331210191

141410,4,0792838955,"I have always had a special fondness for Fiddler on the Roof.  What an exceptional story!  Tevya is outstanding in it.

141411,5,0792838955,"I have seen this film on TV many times and I enjoyed it very much, so I expected it to be fantastic on DVD but it's not the case, I'm very disapointed.  The images are beautifull but the tranfer to DVD is very  poor.  It's like watching an old DOS game on a Commodore VIC 20.  Full of  ""staircase"" all along the film, sometimes like watching through a  ""moustiquaire"".  If I can give my advice, do not buy  ""Fiddler on the Roof"" on DVD format, it's very bad.",952128000,6,458,4.125
141412,5,0792838955,"I consider that this film must won an Oscar Prize.  It is fascinating with regards to: - Music - Actor (The father) - The dances I have seen this film many times and every time I shiver when I see it.  It's so meaningful.  It's not only a question of Jews and Russains.  It's a social problem that  may occur in family whether they are eastern or western families.  Marriage  of girls all over the world is a problem and parents are always after  marrying their daughters and don't worry that much about son's marriage.  It also deal with parents' love,  money problem and how in some countries  marrying young to old rich men seems to be solving poverty problem  regardless of happiness or unhapinness of marriage itself.  It also deals  with Jews versus Russians an item that I am not up to discuss.  But in my  humble knowledge it deals with misery that happened to the jews.",945734400,,878,4.462025316455696

141496,5,0792838955,"Who was Shalom Aleichem, the author of this tale, and what is this tale about? Shalom Aleichem is the pen name of the famous writer Solomon Rabinowitz, who wrote hundreds of humorous tales in Yiddish, and became one of the three most famous early Yiddish writers, along with Mendele Mocher Seforim and Yitzchak Leib Peretz. He was the only one of the three who wrote in a humorous vein. A close reading of the humorous tales reveals the pain suffered by Jews in the nineteenth and twentieth century.
There is a film bio about him that is excellent called ""Shalom Aleichem: Laughter in the Darkness"" which captures this insight. He wrote his humorous tales at a time when Jews suffered in Russia from pogroms and other State-supported Russian murders of Jews. Despite the suffering around him, his humorous tales address how Jews adapted to the modern world and the crisis of identity they suffered as Jews in the modern period.
During his heyday, Shalom Aleichem wrote and published a new story every Friday in the Yiddish newspaper so that fellow Jews could read a funny story on the Shabbat. It is said that he chose the pseudonym Shalom Aleichem, Hebrew for ""hello to you,"" as if to say, ""hello, I am here again."" The famous play and film Fiddler on the Roof is based on some tales of his about Tevya the Milkman.
He was born in 1859 in Russia in a shtetl, a small town made up mostly of poor generally unenlightened Jews. His father was interested in the enlightenment, a movement to give Jewish children a strong secular education and a chance to become part of the modern world, and he sent Solomon to a secular school. Solomon gave private lessons to obtain money and married the daughter of a rich man who he taught and lived a wealthy life until he went bankrupt due to bad investments. He spent every day until around 3 PM as an investor, then spent time writing from 3 PM throughout part of the night. Some scholars think that he began to think or over-think about his stories and did not give sufficient attention to his investments. His mother-in-law paid his debts but she was so disgusted with him that she refused thereafter to speak to him.
Even before Fiddler on the Roof, about Tevya the Milkman, there was a 1939 film called Tevya. One of the main points in Shalom Aleichems story about Tevya was that Tevya was unable to come to term with one of his seven daughters marrying outside Judaism. The films changed this theme and show a reconciliation between father and daughter. All versions show Tevya believing in God in an uneducated painful way, but despite his belief, he was unable to understand and accept the suffering that he understood God was sending him.
Shalom Aleichem died in 1916 in America after years of illness, illnesses that could be treated today. He had escaped to America to avoid the many pogroms. Over 200,000 people attended his funeral. His books continue to be popular in Israel and the US a hundred and one years after his death.",1510876800,3,2977,4.640151515151516

Andrews Blu-ray Review: I am a massive fan of film musicals and growing up in the early to mid 1960s and an era when many of the greatest film musicals were made, like the film adaptations of great Broadway shows like Carousel, Bye Bye Birdie, The Music Man, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music was the typical cinematic fare. Walt Disneys Mary Poppins was another of my all-time favourite film from that era and I remember many a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, I would run off to our local cinema intent upon watching my favourite stars sing and dance their way across the silver screen.

Alas, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, just as I was strating to grow up to my young adulthood, those big splashy film musicals suddenly lost much of their allure to audiences in general, but not for me. One film that really successfully bucked this trend was FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. For nearly forty years now, this film adaptation of that great, long-running Broadway play of the same name has remained one of the most popular and nay, may I venture to say, the most beloved film musicals of all time. FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is a beautifully told story of tradition, love and marriage in a Jewish community living in Czarist Russia at the beginning of the 20th  century and is based on the 19th century story Tevye the Dairyman, by Yiddish storyteller Sholom Alechem.

The story line of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF [1971] is fairly simple; in Norman Jewison, the director's own words, ""It's the story of a man and his God, and his problems with his five daughters."" The man, Tevye, who struggles between the traditions of his Jewish faith and the wills of his headstrong daughters, three of whom are of the marrying age and eager to do something about it. In a role originated on Broadway by comic Zero Mostel, the film's casting drew controversy when the man playing Tevye in the London version, an Israeli actor named Topol, was chosen for the part. Topols understated performance is what made the film the success it did, and served as a sharp contrast to Zero Mostel's over the top antics that worked best onstage. Topol, however, quickly faded into obscurity after the film FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, as did the rest of the cast, actually with one exception and that was Michael Glaser, as the character Perchik, one of the daughter's suitors, would enjoy some great television success in the kitschy mid 1970's TV series Starsky and Hutch as cool policeman Dave Starsky.

Topol is Tevye, who dreams of a better life even as his wilful daughters rebel against his plans of arranged marriages, and the prejudices of the outside world threaten to ruin his cosy existence. John Williams' adapted score was one of the pair of Oscars gleaned from the eight it was nominated for. Jerry Bock's fine songs are actually few and far between, while the plot's political undertones play second fiddle to the trials and tribulations of Tvye. Look out for the actor Paul Michael Glaser from the Starsky and Hutch TV Series.

FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is at its heart a very humorous and poignant examination of that age-old rite of passage from generation to generation, played out in the dusty Russian hamlet of Anatevka in 1905. Director Norman Jewisons treatment of this story is wonderfully sensitive. Tevye, our protagonist, is a man wedded to the centuries-old traditions of the Jewish culture in which he lives. Its a culture that calls for him, as the father of five daughters, to arrange suitable marriages for his children, without regard for their desires. The film is played out against the backdrop of the anti-Semitism that was so rampant in Russia during the first decade of the twentieth century. This bigotry rears its ugly head at unexpected points in the film, adding an excellent element of tension and suspense to this wonderful family-oriented comedy-drama.

Norman Jewison was well respected as a director, thanks to In the Heat of the Night [1967] and The Thomas Crown Affair [1968], two very tough and masculine films. Whereas FIDDLER ON THE ROOF was thus a formidable challenge as it was his first foray into the musical genre. Early on in the project, Norman Jewison determined that the film's success depended on a strong element of realism throughout the production, hence his extensive travels from Canada to much of Eastern Europe. Norman Jewison finally settled on parts of rural Yugoslavia to serve as the film's fictional town of Anatevka. It  was a good choice for location authenticity; the crew was able to use many of the area's existing houses and structures as is, without needing to age or distress them to look like early twentieth century Ukraine. The famed English Cinematographer Oswald ""Ossie"" Morris wanted the look of the film to retain an earthy feel to be able to best communicate the colour and sentiment of the land, so he stuck a nylon stocking over the camera lens. Oswald ""Ossie"" Morris voraciously defended this technique, which raised a few eyebrows when the cinematography was nominated for an Oscar at the 1972 Academy Awards as being the ideal shade to convey his message of genuine simplicity.

Ultimately FIDDLER ON THE ROOF would gross over thirty-eight million dollars; perhaps not surprisingly Norman Jewison attempted another musical in 1973 with the film Jesus Christ Superstar, but it did not do nearly as well. Then Norman Jewison hit a ten-year career slump before successfully remerging with Agnes of God in 1984 and Moonstruck in 1985 a year later and certainly made a comeback that would cause anyone to shout ""MazelTov!"" What I feel with this film, and especially which I feel is very relevant in the 21st Century, is near the end of the film one winter day, the Jews of Anatevka are notified that they have three days to leave the village or be forced out by the Czarist government, where Tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of Europe and the United States and where we see the Constable silently watches as the mass evacuation of Anatevka takes place, definitely a reflection what is happening to communities around where the war torn conflicts are happening on a daily basis and as the famous saying goes, what goes around comes around, meaning: The status eventually returns to its original value after completing some sort of cycle. A person's actions, whether good or bad, will often have consequences for that person.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox, Metro Goldwyn Mayer and United Artists have come together to bring us a stunning 1080p encoded image, plus an equally stunning 2.35:1 accurately framed aspect ratio. Much has been said already about the quality of the film transfer, and my observations are consistent with those who have already praised it. The image features excellent contrast, deep and strong black levels, richly saturated colours and although the palette is heavily towards earth tones, but we also get very pleasing, warm flesh tones. Fine object detail is very good and particularly with the close-ups of the actors, though softness inherent to the source material is also apparent from time-to-time. Theres no indication of attempts to fix those issues with digital processing tools, and likewise theres no signs of heavy handed grain reduction. All in all it is a totally amazing and terrific looking transfer befitting a classic film in this 40th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox, Metro Goldwyn Mayer and United Artists gives us a stunning 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix is consistently clear and intelligible. Surround activity consists mainly of support for the orchestral score, though the effect is very nicely balanced and seamless. Detail in the audio track is best illustrated by the Fiddlers violin solos, which have the satisfying solid sound of the bow grabbing the strings. Low frequency effects are non-existent, but the audio track has great depth and fullness throughout all the musical numbers. John Williams led orchestra fills the surrounds.  Ambiance effects are well positioned especially at the start of the film, and the dialogue is very clear and understandable, even with the accents, coming out of the front speakers. Unfortunately, the ADR work sounds very bad, flat and lifeless, and there's a lot of it as they mouthed the lyrics on the set to music played back and sadly it does not sync very well either, which is the only disappointing aspect to this otherwise stunning film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

In this Original Theatrical Release, and precisely at around 1 Hour 51 Minutes with the film we get an intermission and the Entr'acte and Music.

Audio commentary by Director/Producer Norman Jewison and Actor Topol: Here we are introduced by Norman Jewison and Topol who were recorded separately but edited together very smoothly. Both of them offer interesting facts about filming in Yugoslavia and also talk about the cast and decisions made during filming. Between the two men, there isn't any dead space and I enjoyed listening to this, especially Topols track which was also really very funny. This is a good commentary track, though Norman Jewison and Topol despite not actually together in the same room. They have each got great titbits on the production, from Norman Jewisons point of view he needed to make the film as real as possible and in order to achieve that sense of realism. When Norman saw Topol appearing in the stage version at the Her Majestys Theatre, which is located at the Haymarket in the City of Westminster, London, Norman immediately knew Topol was perfect for the part in the film and was the final reason he chose Topol over Zero Mostel, despite the head of the studio demanding Zero Mostel, but Norman stood his ground and won the day. On top of all that Topol loved playing the part and also felt the part was perfect for him because he had that aspect of being an ideal character that had the Eastern European tradition persona. They each give heart-warming stories about the horse that follows Tevye throughout the film and was very old at the time and loved Topol and we hear how Norman Jewison actually saved it from being slaughtered and ending up in a glue factory, and by sending money back to someone who had a farm in Yugoslavia allowed the horse to live a happy like for another four years grazing on the farm. When you see early on with Topol in the barn, and tells us he was suffering from a very serious tooth ache and that is why he has a pained look on his face. When we see the young daughter walking home with the cow and rescued from belligerent Russian men, she is saved by the handsome Russian man, well Norman informs is that this actor was actually Italian and despite this, felt he was right for the part. When you see the dream sequence in the cemetery, when you hear the rabbi speak, this is actually Norman Jewison doing the dubbed speaking. When we get to the wedding scene ceremony, Norman informs us that to get the right atmosphere on the screen, the film was filmed with a piece of silk stocking over the lens that was offered up to them with a young lady secretary who worked at Pinewood Studio and was also used for the rest of the filming. As we get to near the end of the film and the scene with the Tevye and his family have left their village and the fiddler is following them and Tevye wants him to follow them and that that point Norman Jewison says, Thanks for staying with us, especially if you have stayed with us this long and it has been an experience for me, and to look at this film again, that was made many years ago and I guess it was one of the Top 30 all-time grossing films and it has played to millions and millions of people all over the world and many languages and thanks to M-G-M and United Artist, and will go onto play for many many more years, and as you read all the credits, it is a film that has had great contribution by a lot of talents and it was an extra ordinary talented group of people, who helped to put all this together and I shall always be eternally grateful to me. And so ends another wonderful and special audio commentary by the very talented director Norman Jewison and actor Topol, who gave us some many very special moments about the film and also special information about all aspect of the film and what happened behind-the-scenes and one should make an effort to listen, despite being 181 minutes long.

Special Feature: Norman Jewison, Film Maker [1971] [480i] [1.37:1] [49:33] The National Film Board of Canada finds us on location in Yugoslavia and four months into production and looks at the making of the film FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. It was very interesting to see him direct on the set and talk about his background and working in the Hollywood system. The production was epic, as well as looking like chaotic mess, especially for the time, and we get to see Norman Jewison throwing hissy fits on the set, especially with a hilarious scene where he is trying to get a flock of geese to react in a certain way to be filmed. We also get to see him agonizing over the non-cooperation of the weather, especially where he wanted snow, but Yugoslavia, where much of the exterior scenes the film FIDDLER ON THE ROOF were shot, decided not to have snow that November; and Norman Jewison wanted overcast days, but instead it would be sunny. We get to see him chastising his cast. We also get to see him crying at a moving performance. In other words, Norman Jewison is a very emotional filmmaker or at least he was back then. Norman Jewison also gives us behind-the-scenes insights and scoops on the state of Hollywood in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the differences filming in someplace like Yugoslavia versus, say, New York City, ""creative bookkeeping"", and the ""suits'"" concern with budgets over artistry. A lot of this stuff is surprisingly candid as well as the emotional outbursts. We see also see images and clips from his previous films like Forty Pounds of Trouble [1962], The Thrill Of It All [1962], Send Me No Flowers [1964], The Art of Love [1964], The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming [1966], In The Heat Of The Night [1967], The Thomas Crown Affair [1968] and The Cincinnati Kid [1965]. One interesting comment Norman Jewison makes is about the actor Steve McQueen that appeared in two of his films and says that he was one of the worst actors he ever had to work with, as he use to mind games. Contributors include Tony Curtis and Topol.

Special Feature: Norman Jewison Looks Back [2007] [1080i] [1.78:1] With this special feature, it is broken up into five separate options. The five sections include: On Directing [3:28] Here Norman Jewison talks about how he was hired for the job and how his name played into it and also how Norman Jewison got involved in the film adaptation, in particular how the executive producers reacted when he revealed he was a gentile. Strongest Memory [00:57] Here Norman Jewison talks about the cast and the actual villagers from where the film was made and reflecting on trying to capture the films iconic image. Biggest Challenge [1:11] Here we hear how the weather was Norman Jewisons worst enemy for this film since they were trying to capture every season on film. On Casting [1:20] Here Norman Jewison talks about the controversial choice of picking Topol over the originator of the role of Zero Mostel. Finally A Classic? [2:34] Here Norman Jewison attributes the universal success of the film to themes such as tradition that resonate with many cultures including the Japanese people.

Special Feature: Tevye's Dream in Full Color: Here we have two separate items relating to the same subject, where we get a look at the full colour version of the concocted dream sequence story by Tevye before it was desaturated for the final film and so nice to have the two comparisons, which is as follows: Tevye's Dream Sequence in Full Color: With An Introduction by Norman Jewison [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1 / 2.35:1] [5:56] and Side-by-Side Comparison [2007] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:39]

Special Feature: John Williams: Creating A Musical Tradition [2006] [1080i] [1.37:1] [11:32] Here we get to see master composer John Williams talks about adapting the score of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF to the Big Screen presentation and tells us his intentions and how he felt about the original work and how grateful he was to be able to work on it and it has John Williams speaking about how important this film was to his career. John Williams also speaks about how he had to adapt the original music from the stage play to play bigger than it had on stage because Norman Jewison had built up this entire world from the foundations of the play. We also get to view some rare black-and-white images of behind-the-scenes of the film and we also get to view some clips from the film. Contributors include John Williams [Composer], Joseph Stein [Screenwriter], Sheldon Harnick [Lyricist] and Jerry Bock [Composer via Telephone Interview, March 2006] (archive sound only).

Special Feature: Songs of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF [2006] [1080i] [1.37:1] [14:43] Screenwriter Joseph Stein, lyricist Sheldon Harnick, and original composer Jerry Bock reflect on the creation of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF signature melodies and lyrics, who were the original team behind the music with a mix of new interviews, and some older recordings which allows all to participate in this segment even though two of them have now sadly passed away. We also get to view some clips from the film, plus we also get to hear personal and insightful comments from Joseph Stein [Screenwriter], Sheldon Harnick [Lyricist] and Jerry Bock [Composer via Telephone Interview, March 2006] (archive sound only) talk about the original play and how much they really liked the film version.

Special Feature: Deleted Song: Any Day Now [2006] [1080i] [1.37:1] [3:07] This song was meant to introduce Perchik [Paul Michael Glaser] to the film, but was decided not to be included in the film and we get to hear a rare audio demo song of the deleted musical number Any Day Now, but thankfully was saved and kindly provided by composer Jerry Brock. Since it was never filmed, here it is accompanied by a series of black-and-white and colour still images, as well clips from the film.

Special Feature: Tevye's Daughters [2006] [1080i] [1.37:1] [16:28] Here we get a hear the three oldest daughters that appeared in the film, which are Rosalind Harris [Tzeitel], Neva Small [Chava] and Michele Marsh [Hodel] talk about how they were hired for the film and recount their experiences working on the film. We also get to hear comments from Lynn Stalmaster [Casting Director] and Sheldon Harnick [Lyricist]. This is a wonderful interview with the three woman and they each talk about how important the film was to them personally and what an amazing time in their lives it was to be in this wonderful film. They also praise the director Norman Jewison, as they found him to be a very kind person and also felt he had a soul. We also once again get to see some rare black-and-white and colour behind-the-scene images from the film, as well as clips from the film.

Special Feature: Set In Reality Production Design [2006] [1080i] [1.37:1] [9:50] Here we get a talk with Robert Boyle [Production Designer] who discusses the locations and sets in making an effort to make the village look real and well used. Robert Boyle also informs us how he really wanted Anatevka to be a real place and not just a film set and that is why so many pains went into making the place seem as real as possible. Apparently due to the German army in the Second World War removed and destroyed so many towns like the one in this film, it was difficult to find the perfect shooting location, but in Yugoslavia they were able to find just the right location. We also get to compare the roughly drawn storyboards with the actual  film clips from the film, as well as rare black-and-white images.

Special Feature: Storyboard To Film Comparison [2006] [1080i] [1.37:1] [21:04] Here we get to view a view the comparison of several musical sequences from the roughly drawn storyboards and with the finished scenes in the film, especially relating to Tradition; Matchmaker; Introduction to Miracle of Miracles; Tevyes Dream; Lazar Wolf and Tevye.

Special Feature: Trailers, Teasers and TV Spots: Here we to view six separate trailers and they are as follows: Original Theatrical Trailer [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:04]. Original Re-release Theatrical Trailer [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:52]. Reserve Your Seat Teaser [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:46] With information for reserve seat ticket purchasing. Will Rogers Teaser [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:03] This was a screening to benefit the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital. TV Spot [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:31]. TV Spot [1979] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:28] to promote the theatrical re-release. With the Reserve Your Seat and Will Rogers Teaser Trailers, for some unknown reason they showed the image squeezed that should have been viewed in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio.

Finally, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF [1971] is a totally sheer delightful film from start to finish! The acting is wonderful throughout, performed to perfection by a strong ensemble cast. There is a marvellous chemistry among all the actors, so its hard to single out any one performance as being more exceptional than the others. Topol who was nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for his performance and reprises his Broadway role as the tradition-bound yet dreamy Tevye and he succeeded the late Zero Mostel, who originally played Tevye on stage. The late Norma Crane is equally brilliant as the strong-willed, sharp-tongued Golde. The part of Perchik, the radical student who wins the heard of Hodel, is expertly played by one of the few widely recognizable faces in the cast Paul Michael Glaser. This film version of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF remains remarkably true to the stage version. Despite the length of the film, which is nearly three hours long, but despite this the film FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is sheer magic and entertainment at its best. It also offers some great music that makes you want to get up and sing the IF I WAS A RICH MAN and feel you are dancing with Tevye. Norman Jewison did an admirable job directing this film, because it could have easily veered away into saccharine or gone too dark. The film does an admirable job of blending generous humour along with some heavy themes. Add in the amazing original music and the contributions of John Williams and you have a winner. So, go ahead journey back in time to the dusty Russian village of Anatevka and fall in love with Tevye and Golde and Lazar Wolf, Yente, Mendel and Mordcha. It is a journey well worth making! Highly Recommended!

Be advised that this marathon operetta is exclusively from the Jewish point of view.  At another level, it documents the breaking down of Tevya's iron grip on tradition as his daughters get married off - the first in the traditional way through a match maker to a wimpy, effeminate taylor, the last to a wimpy, effeminate Communist.

141843,5,0792838955,"It's a great musical and the acting is nothing to scoff at.  The storyline is perfectly summarized in Amazon:
""Norman Jewison's adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical is set in the Ukranian ghetto village of Anatevka. Tevye the milkman, played by Israeli actor Topol, is constantly being challenged by his poverty, the romantic entanglements of his five daughters, and the prejudicial attitudes of non-Jews., Tevye carries on lengthy conversations with God whenever the weight of the world becomes too much for him, he does not answer but he is at least more willing to listen than the milkman's remonstrative wife Golde. Tevye is forced to do some quick rearranging when his oldest daughter Tzeitel falls in love with poor tailor Motel Kamzoil after he has already arranged a marriage between her and wealthy butcher Lazar Wolf. Fancying himself more broad-minded than his gentile oppressors, Tevye cannot accept the notion that his other daughter Chava would want to marry Fyedka, a non-Jew. When Tevye and his neighbors are forced out of Anatevka by the Czar's minions he must find a way to change his tune and his entire life.""

Secondly, I read many reviews saying the HD transfer wasn't that great, or didn't seem like true HD, I have to disagree with other reviews. I thought the picture looked great! Sharp, clear and crisp (but, I was also watching it on a 4K HD TV with a 4k upconverting blu ray player.) Plus any movie from the 70's, 80's, 90's or even the early 2000's will show limitations when given an HD overhaul. Overall I thought Fiddler on The Roof was great on blu ray, if you're a fan of it then you can't go wrong with this.",1459987200,2,771,4.181208053691275

142016,5,0792838955,"I saw Fiddler on the Roof in the movies as a kid and the stage production of it at Jones Beach Theater in 1974 when they still produced full-scale plays (only music now) followed by music and dancing to the Guy Lombardo Orchestra in the tents on the ground level of the theatre. A year or two later, I played one of the daughters in a musical number at a school concert singing Matchmaker Matchmaker (the daughter that went to Siberia). So by the time I was about 11, the show had made an enormous impact on my life. Next up is the current Broadway play, which I am looking forward to seeing.

Anyway, I cant believe I never purchased this until now, considering my history with it. But I was flipping through the channels one day and there is was and I realized I didn't own it. I ordered a copy that day.

I think everyone knows the premise of the story, at least generally. An Orthodox family of Russian Jews, along with the entire town of Anatevka, face religious persecution and expulsion from their homes and village. In the meantime, the main character Tevye, played by Topol, is experiencing the changing times in his own family as his older daughters (he has five) marry, one by one, to men that, by traditional Orthodox standards, are not exactly who Tevye would choose for them (a tailor, an activist, and GASP, a Christian!). Though he reluctantly accepts the first two marriages, he cannot accept the marriage of his third daughter to a Christian and shuns her.

Topol holds this production together with such sensitivity, you will have tears in your eyes during certain scenes and then be howling with laughter in others. Some of the scenes are so powerful  the three girls dancing together in a field, silhouetted, Tevye asking Golde if she loves him, the attack on the wedding party, the expulsion march out of Anatevka, an old woman being carried out of the village in her bed, the cemetery dream sequence, the ferry carrying refugees  absolutely stunning. And yet some of the most poignant scenes are the most simple  Tevye pushing a milk cart (his horse went lame) to make deliveries in the village whilst conversing with God on this matter or that.

Norman Jewison, the director of Moonstruck and many other notable films, does an outstanding job of capturing all of the emotions and tribulations the family faces as they move into an unknown future in a changing world on their way to a new life in New York.

When I started reading up on this movie in the last few weeks, I was surprised to learn that Topol was only in his 30s when he made this film (hes about 80 now) and saddened to learn that Norma Crane who played Golde died just a couple of years after this film came out at the age of 44 (cancer). Also, Leonard Frey who played Motel the tailor passed away from complications of Aids in the 1980s while still in his 40s.

Its really such a beautiful production that every person should see at least once in their life, especially since things like this continue to be a problem in the world today.

142022,5,0792838955,"I can't explain the hold this film has on me.  I love several other Jewison movies--""The Russians are Coming..."" and ""JC Superstar"" being all-time favorites--but this one never fails to have me helplessly stifling my blubberings lest those around me have me committed.  I'm not Jewish, I'm not a history fanatic, and I certainly don't fall for every musical I see.  Yet ""Fiddler"" feels like an old pair of leather gloves, puts me in a place I long to be.  It strums all of my sentimental chords.

What I noticed on my most recent viewing is that none of the actors are really singers in the traditional sense (not counting Barry Dennen portraying an earnest, black-hatted Jew two years before his astounding turn as Pontius Pilate), yet their flawed performances enhance the film's emotional sincerity.  Even Topol doesn't hit all the notes, but not once does the viewer doubt what he's singing comes from his heart.

I don't know if it's the stoic perseverance through hardship, the infringement of modern problems on hallowed traditions (TRADITIONS!), my own yearning for village-sized community, the portrayal of people stepping outside their roles to show unanticipated humanness, or the sheer artistry of every shot--but ""Fiddler"" has been and will always be my cinematic companion through my ironically areligious life.  I'm happy to pass it on to the next generation.",1451692800,,1374,5.075555555555556

A few decades later, and I am more knowledgeable of the plight of the Jews during the pogroms. (A pogrom is a violent riot aimed at massacre or persecution of an ethnic or religious group, particularly one aimed at Jews. The term originally entered the English language to describe 19th- and 20th-century attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire (mostly within the Pale of Settlement in present-day Ukraine and Belarus.  This information comes from Wikipedia, but apparently I will not be able to paste the link to it here.  Please search for ""pogrom"" on Wikipedia to learn more about it.)  The story, itself, comes from the series of short stories about ""Tevye the Dairyman"" and ""Tevye's Daughters"" (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_5?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=tevye+the+dairyman&sprefix=tevye%2Cstripbooks%2C156), by Sholem Aleichem (http://www.amazon.com/Sholem-Aleichem/e/B001HOSS52).

I have read the script for the broadway musical for fun, which is available for purchase. Of course, the film has more entertainment value than fact.  No one is killed as it was during the pogroms.  It's very much pg rated and can be watched by the whole family.",1436313600,,1313,5.595959595959596

I think they do a wonderful job in the movie, and the cast, particularly Topol, is excellent.  As I get older, I identify with different characters, but the idea of change, generational, political, and economic is as universal as can be.  It allows Fiddler to always be new and always be relevant.  Can't get much better than that.  I read that Harnick and Bock were very clear in the aim to keep the ""flavor"" of a shetl and to make their vision of life there as real as possible. Jerome Robbins worked to make the universality come through as well as that sad time.  It was all quite wonderful, and every once in a while I want to see it, sing with it, and cry with it.",1433721600,,804,4.256578947368421

142540,1,0792838955,"I saw this movie when it premiered at New York's great Rivoli theater.
 Earlier in the year I had seen the original production towards the end of its' long run just a few blocks north at the Broadway Theater.
I was so disappointed in this film. It captured non of the color and brilliance of that stage production. That production was filled with brilliant yellows blues and greens while this was a poorly lit and washed out bore. The original was stunning and filled with life. In this dreary documentary styled presentation you wonder why anyone wants to be alive.

And god the miserable way Robbins great choreography is treated. Just the opening Tradition tells you this is going to be one of the worst adaptions possible of a great stage musical. We get nothing but a montage of daily drudgery. Look at the openings of Sound of Music and West Side Story. The films are shot off like rockets while here Jewison looks like he was late with a homework assignment.

I only give this one star(well I have to) for the wonderful performances of Leonard Frey and Rosalind Harris. They fill their characters with humor and pathos giving us a glint of what this film could have been.

I've tried watching this film on TCM but I can't. It's as dull as I remember it. And I wonder why people are complaining about the picture quality of this DVD. It looked pretty bad on the Rivoli's huge curved screen. 16mm blown up to 70mm.  This film is nothing but dark, depressing and tedious. I guess this film is so loved because the story and songs are so great. Fiddler is filled with enormous pain and anguish which of course life is. But it can also be filled with energy, hope and love all of which the stage production conveyed. If only Robert Wise had done this film. I'm sure he was offered it. I wonder why he didn't do it.",1432857600,,1816,4.457831325301205

142634,5,0792838955,"Set in 1905 Russia as tradition is subtly and sometimes violently supplanted by change, Fiddler on the Roof is a study of a Jewish family and village in general and the family's papa in particular.  Try as he might, he cannot stop the nonstop changes that sweep over them.
Topol stars as Teyve and Norman Crane as Golde, his long-suffering wife. They have 5 daughters, and with 3 of them at or near the age of marriage, the sub-plots engineered by the village matchmaker and the daughters complicate the parents' lives beyond human endurance. The film is rare in that every character, from the daughters to their suitors to the fiddler to the neighbors, seem perfectly cast.  Meanwhile, the pogroms ordered by the Czar throw their entire village and many others into chaos.
The film is like an immersion into what Judaism was like for those who lived in Europe  in the early 20th century: tight knit families and communities where their Rabbi and  Scriptures determined every day life and survival,  even when it meant fleeing, often to America. Teyve's many conversations with God reveal a faith and understanding that is sorely lacking today, among Jews and Christians alike.",1430179200,,1177,4.894472361809045

The final print looks fantastic. Brilliant detail but with the color just be washed out enough that it looks like it's pre WWI Russia. (If you make a period piece like this look TOO realistic, you take the time period out of it and make it look too modern)

This movie was so well made with so much attention to detail that it deserves to be watched in full HD with 5.1 channel stereo sound for the music.

When viewing over the Firestick I did not notice any of the audio syncing problems people seem to be having with the Blu Ray.

Fiddler has a special place in my heart. It makes me feel like I understand what it was like to be Jewish in Russia during the diaspora.

I love the music, I love singing along with some of the songs, and I work to make sure that I'll be able to finish the movie in one sitting. All too often, I have had to stop watching in the middle, and I hate that.

He is pulled between his traditions and a changing world. The family is caught up in a movement out of their control, and eventually must face a new future.

I love the ways that deep themes are often treated in musicals. There is the historical treatment of the prejudices against the Jews in Russia. This was a great way to introduce my kids to a little history and a little culture difference's from today's youth.

When I was younger I loved the"" Matchmaker"" song, and now I love the song ""Do You Love Me"". My teens cracked up over the Tevye's comments to God about his life.  This is a wonderful movie to watch as a family.",1408665600,,784,4.319727891156463

Also, dishonoring your father by going against his wishes, ummm, no..... Not the way to show love and respect for your parents.

Even through the difficult sections containing confrontation between the villagers and the ""Russian Administrators"", it remains a story for all time, very much like Les Mis. It is a human story about the right of people to simply exist, told with irony, humor, romanticism and even some hard truth.

143732,5,0792838955,"On one of the features on the collector's edition DVD set, director Norman Jewison said he considers a ""classic"" something which transcends national, religious, cultural, and generational differences and provides a universal human connection.  By that definition, this is indisputably a classic.  In the quality of the filmmaking, it also is.  I'm a huge film buff, and I know when something is done with quality sometimes just from seeing the trailer and otherwise after 5 minutes of the movie.  It'd been probably 10 years since I saw this movie, though I've seen it in live theatre between then and now.  From the opening sunrise on this musical movie, it's already got an aura of quality.  The cinematography got an Academy Award for good reason.  John Williams also earned his first Academy Award for adapting the stage musical's music to a larger orchestra and adding instrumental music for the movie.  Norman Jewison also deserves a lot of credit for his casting choices, especially Topol as Tevye, and for the energy and feeling of day-to-day realism the movie has.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE DVD EDITION:  The collector's edition has features about the songwriting and orchestrating process, retrospectives by the 3 actresses for Tevye's 3 oldest daughters, and a few other features, not in the special edition.  The collector's edition has more special features than the special edition.

Its theme is the desperate attempt to keep stability in your life as society and your own descendants change.  Japan embraced the movie even more than the US and Europe did because they were throwing off centuries of traditions very quickly.

I really enjoy the first half of the musical because it's a storyline befitting a comic opera or situation comedy where deception helps solve an interpersonal problem.  I'd probably only choose to see the musical once or twice total if the second half, significantly darker, was all there is.  The first half makes it worthwhile for me to watch the whole musical.  A lot of the music is delightful, and my favorites are ""If I Were a Rich Man"" and ""L'Chaim"".  Most of the time, I feel like the dialogue is very realistic and believable, which is what Jewison wanted the film to feel like.  The only time I feel like it's hokey is when the third daughter insists to Tevye that the world is changing as she wants to marry outside the faith.  Interracial marriage between a Jew and a Gentile was unacceptable to both sides in eastern Europe.  That was one area in which larger society was NOT changing.  I also feel like the musical should have spent 5-10 more minutes on developing the romances of Tevye's 2nd and 3rd daughters.  It is unclear to me how the 2nd one falls in love with a Jewish revolutionary who's almost tunnel-visioned about overthrowing the government with little interest in her.  It makes for some interesting humor as he calls marriage a socioeconomic bond, but it's not very believable to me.  I would have liked a little more development of how the 3rd one becomes infatuated with a nice man of Russian Orthodox faith just because he protects her from some potential bullies and tempts her with a smile to read a book he has.  Is that enough to cause a deep romance?  And at the end of Tevye's opening monologue, where he says without tradition, their lives would be as shaky as a fiddler on a roof, I've always been confused, because WITH tradition, their lives are as shaky as a fiddler on a roof!  The fiddler is a symbol of how traditions/customs add stability and enjoyment to life, and the roof is the shakiness of that stability.  Thus that line where Tevye tells what the title means doesn't make sense.  Those criticisms are minor.  I have a lot of respect for the musical genius of the melodies and the careful placement of songs through the musical, and for the acting, pace, and cinematography.

This was the last ""traditional"" movie musical before the 1970s and 1980s brought on new countercultural styles.  Hello, Dolly! came just before it.  It is interesting that movie musicals sometimes encapsulate entire eras.  American national optimism had died about the time the Camelot movie was made and wouldn't come back until the Reagan presidency.  The Camelot musical is, of course, associated with JFK, who liked the musical (died several years before the movie, though).  My Fair Lady was the last movie to feel like old Warner Brothers showmanship, late in Jack Warner's tenure there.  It kind of wrapped up 30 years of the Warners' influence on Warner Brothers.  As for Fiddler on the Roof, it reflects back on the Holocaust and on how the authorities rationalize injustice by saying they're just following orders.  Coming out in the early 1970s, it also seems to be the perfect encapsulation of the last several years of turmoil.  Neither the stage musical nor the movie's filming and release were designed to be timed with certain social changes, but I find that an interesting coincidence.  The Fiddler movie is 1) an indirect reflection on the Holocaust, 2) encapsulates the generation gap and loss of stability which Americans felt in the early 70s, and 3) stylistically embodies its own theme of ""tradition"".  It is the last movie musical with a spectacular style similar to big-budget ones like My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music, the last vestige of that ""tradition"".",1398211200,,5356,4.865342163355408

Hits like, ""If I was a Rich Man,"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" and ""Tradition!"" are just a few of the songs that are so catchy and apropo. So often in musicals, people bust into song at times that seem so weird - here the music is seamlessly integrated that it seems normal for them to continue the story through music.
Topol's performance is magnificent. He has humor and pathos and a likable quality that is really irresistible. The rest of the cast is great and the direction is spot-on.
Highly recommended, not just as a musical, but as a wonderful movie about people dealing with traditions in an ever-changing world and the loving compromises they make. This movie ROCKS!",1397520000,2,941,4.476744186046512

143757,5,0792838955,"You must watch this movie when you have 3 peaceful hours to give it your undivided attention.  The first time I tried to watch it among distractions, and it seemed slow and boring.  Then, I started watching it again on my iPad on a late flight, and I was saddened by the fact that the plane was landing during the movie.  This is the type of movie that you get absorbed in.  The HD is not very HD, so you're probably better off with a standard definition version if it's cheaper.  That got me to thinking if they'll ever do a remake.  If they did, it would be a let-down because no one will ever top Topol as Tevye.  The really weird thing, is that I find myself strangely jealous of these poor Jews who are being run out of Russia.  How is that possible?  Because, while their life is hard, it is also simple yet replete with an ethical standard.  In a strange way, that makes them rich, despite extreme hardship.",1396915200,,914,4.261627906976744

143786,5,0792838955,"This is one of my favorite musicals. The songs, some humorous , some heart breaking, are brilliantly interwoven into the story line. It is easy to feel and see how life was  for Jews living in Russia before the Revolution. The main focus is on one of these families, seen through their timeless traditions. These traditions are vitally important to the ""PaPa"" of the family, but eventually his daughters choose to follow their own hearts, rather than their ""PaPa's"" wishes. Life in a rural Russian town had many hardships but despite prejudice, the Jews attempted to live in their own little enclave, going about the business of daily living. The local  commissar, seen early on as sympathetic to the Jews, receives some disturbing orders from the Central Government. How must he carry out these orders on those whom he thinks are ok, not really a nuisance? This becomes a dilemma for the whole town, but it is soon resolved. This movie, even for those who dislike musicals will hold your interest from beginning to end. To Life!",1395360000,,1029,4.807909604519774

It gos beyond musicale and introduces a lifestyle that no longer exists. Historicly it preserves a time on film that would be lost if not for it's telling in this classic. The turning of time is captured, we see tolerance by the Russion nationals who live by this community. Shockingly we see that people will do anything to save themselves, forced to burn, beat, kill anyone that is different. We see lives ripped apart, humiliated and forced into a life of no hope.

143870,4,0792838955,"Beautifully remastered, shot with the eye of the masters on canvas, cast mostly with perfectly attuned actors, but the wildness of the stage, the heat of the ""in your face"" presentation live is so difficult to maintain in a film....Ron Marshall got very close in CHICAGO but with all his talent and hard work, Mr. Jewison didn't quite hit the mark.  He was afraid of a Tevye too large and too ""theatrical"" I suppose.  But sticking to the reality of film as opposed to the  creative world of theatricality, for me, leaves a big gap from the level of success that this piece deserves.  And when they transferred Tevye's dream in such a surreal, theatrical manner it pointed out how easily a little bit of this might have added to the entire film.  But, it's like complaining about a terrific dinner that needed a bit more creative cooking and some extra spice.  The music is wonderful, the story still breaks the heart and allows us to crack a smile....and who knows, one day this will be the only history of the original musical, so at least they all did their heartfelt best.....but on the other hand.....",1391990400,,1105,4.612244897959184

The gentleman that played Tevye sounded SO MUCH like Topol!!!  It was like watching the movie!  If you LOVE musicals, you WILL LOVE this film!!

Oh for the days when moving to America was seen as a chance.  We Americans would do well to view this history lesson in ""Real Life"".  This is a film filled with real people struggling with real tragedy brought on by real prejudices which even those who persecute unfairly do not chose to participate in persecution.

143957,2,0792838955,"The movie is a five star movie in my opinion.  The actual content of the blu ray disk sparkles with amazing color and detail.  The sound, as far as I am concerned is excellent with good lip synching.  However the fact that every time the movie is stopped it starts over from the beginning is a real negative compared to the standard DVD which will remember where it was.  Stop the movie to feed the kid -- it starts over.  Stop it to answer the phone, again a restart.  I think I must have seen the opening credits at least 10 times just to watch the movie through once!  This is inexcusable since blu ray can be authored to remember location.  Also the menu set up for the extras is bizzare -- a ribbon at the bottom of the screen that cannot be accessed until the opening sequence of the movie starts.  If you have a big enough screen to benefit from the additional detail of blu ray you might want to consider buying this edition, however unless you watch your movies all the way through in one sitting with no interuptions be prepared for frustration.",1389052800,7,1055,4.341836734693878

It shows the style of living and the traditions that were a strong part of their culture, and how displacement of these people causes them to change and forego their traditions.

I don't blame the film itself...I blame Amazon Instant Video...although they refunded my money...it was STILL an unpleasant and frustrating experience!

143971,3,0792838955,"Although this blu-ray/dvd version is in High Definition and in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio for the blu-ray version, I give this product only 3 stars. Why? Although there are English subtitles, this only applies to the dialogue but does not cover the songs which happen to be the heart and soul of this timeless classic. The sound level is so weak that the volume level of my player has to be pumped up all the way to Volume 24 when other movies I see on blu-ray are only on Volume 12! There is that difference. The key to total enjoyment of a blu-ray product is excellent picture and sound which is why I am collecting my favorites on blu-ray even if I already have the dvd versions. While the picture quality of this blu-ray version is excellent, this is not complemented by the sound quality which is weak and leaves much to be desired especially since this is a classic musical. As consumers, we deserve nothing but the best and not something which we should just settle for.

The story/musical is enjoyable and serious. Good acting, catchy tunes with words easy to understand. Good insight into the situation of the Jews in Russia during the time period that the story is set. Well worth the watch!",1386979200,,609,4.205128205128205

They were fascinated with the story. Papa picks the groom?!?!  The larger political/social narrative was way too much for them to comprehend (except for the 13 year old). I was able to share the music that I loved and they loved it too.  A three hour movie with intermission and they stayed to the end. They wanted to get back to the story and see who marries who.

For those who have not seen it, I recommend this on many levels:  as a cinematic treat, a timeless story that could be taking place right now in different countries and to different groups.

The acting is extremely well done.  The cinematography is beautiful, and directing provides for an actual ""storyline"" not just a bunch of people bursting into song.  This film is also based on real/true events during Russia's tumultuous days during the Bolshevik Revolution, World War I, the initial rise of Communism, and how it effects a small village of Russian Jews with each village member simply trying to raise a family, and provide some form of income.

144059,5,0792838955,"The fiddler on the roof is symbolic of the difficulty of maintaining balance in a complicated and sometimes hostile world. Israeli actor Topol portrays Tevye, the poor milkman in a Russian Jewish village. He is the boss in his family, nominally at least, because he is the Papa. His domestic problems involve living in a home with six women, his wife and five daughters; his bigger problem is the current of anti-Semitism in Czarist Russia. He is a fiddler on the roof.

A staunch upholder of tradition handed down for millennia, Tevye assumes he will dictate the marriage circumstances of his daughters, particularly the three older girls who are already of the appropriate age. The village matchmaker arranges for the eldest daughter Tzeitel to marry the wealthy local butcher, a widower past middle age, but Tzeitel wants to marry Motel, the timid tailor. Tevye sings to himself in working out the dilemma, invoking Tradition!, but bending to his daughters wishes as he tells himself on the other hand...  His second daughter wants to wed a radical revolutionary, an even harder decision for Tevye, but, on the other hand When the third daughter wishes to marry an ethnic Russian peasant who is also a Christian, Tevye reaches the breaking point: on the other hand no! no!, there is no other hand!

Fiddler on the Roof is a wonderful evocation of time and place, with a stellar cast. The film is loaded with atmospheric detail and numerous darkly lit scenes, all tremendously improved by the high-definition restoration in the Blu-ray edition. Dozens of improved scenes could be cited, but for example look at the amazing detail revealed in Tevyes stamping dance in the loft of the barn, with the dust rising from his feet; or the dream scene which Tevye uses to convince his wife that their daughter should not marry the butcher. Having seen Fiddler several times over many years, the high-definition version was a revelation, and almost like seeing the film for the first time.

Released in 1971, Fiddler on the Roof is a perfect film for a high-definition restoration, because the minute details, the colors and the many memorable songs are all given new life by Blu-ray technology. Whether you already love it, or have never seen it, this is a must-see.",1378598400,2,2260,4.892950391644908

Comment: why can I buy a movie on the website and not have it go to my amazon roku player??? I'm not stupid enough to pay for the same thing twice. This should automatically be added to my account no matter where I want to watch it.

144105,5,0792838955,"but I do have a biased viewpoint. I did see Zero Mostel on stage, and I did find the casting of Israeli bass Chaim Topol from the London stage an act of genius. Mostel, who is not a singer but a comedian, played the role for laughs. Topol brings a voice and a gravitas that does Bashevis Singers's story justice.  Topol's Tevye is a man who believes he is living as G-d commands him to, and is bewildered at  why the world won't let him keep on living that way. He does not like how the world is changing, but his duty compels him to survive in it and to protect the traditions that made his life meaningful. This story resonates with me because my forbears were driven from their home in the Pale of Settlement by these same pogroms in 1914
  The DVD is technically perfect. The artistic and production values cannot be improved. There will never be any need for a remake! The scenery, the sets, the costuming are all painstakingly accurate to the region and time. I like that  there was no silly show-that-this-is-a-different-country-by-making-everyone-speak-in-fake-British-accents. There is one tiny glitch--which I have noticed only because I have watched this movie so many times: In the song ""Far from the Home I Love"" --which was deleted from a re-release version of the film--someone forgot to cover Michele Marsh's dental fillings and they flash in the light. I am bewildered that ""Fiddler on the Roof"" did NOT win the Best Picture Oscar.",1373155200,,1448,4.73015873015873

Topol, the star figure in the cast, transcends other roles he has had, with an absolutely perfect portrayal of Tevye.  The same can be said for Norma Crane in the role of Golda.  The other members of the cast lend credence, humor and pathos to the story line as well.  Is it any wonder why the movie made such an impressions on critics the world over.  I've seen it on stage and on DVD, and each time I see it, I come away with the grandeur that I experienced the very first time I saw it.  The music and the story are magnificent, be it presented by a high school drama class or on a professional stage.  I purchased the DVD so that I might show it to my grandchildren whenever I am called on to baby sit, hoping that it will be remembered as one of the greatest musicals ever.

The cinematograghy is splendid, locations may not be in Russia but you wouldn't know that unless some one tell you that but I believe Russia never looked that authentic. I can't prise it enough, it's more than you might expect if you don't know it, which it's hard to believe, who doesan't know: Sun rise, sun set?

I returned it and got my money back, but I wanted the movie and was disappointed that I had to go through all of that. You would think that they would make that(the region)clear for the sale and/or if you are requesting to ship to a state in the US that they would realize you are requesting Region 1.

I saw the Musical in High School and once again later on with my parents but the movie is MUCH better and the music is BEAUTIFUL!

He is now working on movie sets as a crew member for setting up the sites and locations. Gran Torino was his favorite experience so far.

144193,5,0792838955,"I never was a big fan of musicals. To me, they are characterized by an excess of sentimental slush, paper-thin plots, two-dimensional characters and contrived scenarios for an excuse to add another song or dance. However, Norman Jewison's Fiddler on the Roof seems to exhibit more of the genre's strengths than weaknesses.

The episodical plot involves the everyday life experiences of a Jewish milkman named Tevye and how each of his three older daughters marry away from the law and tradition, one 'pushing the envelope' a little further than the one before. Tevye is high-strung, hot-tempered, gruff, cantankerous and sometimes plain annoying but if you look beyond his rough exterior you'll see that he really does love and care about his family. One of his most consistent traits is that in spite of having almost no spare time to read the scriptures as he often longs to, he carries on a constant conversation with God.

One thing I admire about Jewison's direction is that he doesn't fall into the trap of casting big stars (Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, etc.--all undeniably favorites of mine.) in the leading roles simply because the iconic names would sell more tickets. He chooses his actors based on who is most suited for their parts regardless of their popularity or star status. In other words, he is more concerned with the artistic quality of the film than making a quick buck. Chaim Topol (Tevye) lights up the screen with his stagey, larger than life, multi-dimensional performance in the leading role and won a richly merited oscar nomination although he didn't win it. And it does not matter as the Academy is mostly a popularity contest with actors, having little to do with true merit. You win the trophy, you are the talk of the town for a week and then everyone forgets you in the next two or so decades. What really matters is the quality of your performance--that you gave the audience something to remember for years to come. (Julie Andrews losing out a Best Leading Actress nomination for Maria in The Sound of Music is a perfect example.) Topol can do more with a look in his eyes than most actors today can with an entire script. The scene where Lazar Wolf says ""This means a lot to me Tevye because frankly I'm lonely. I like her."" referring to Tevye's eldest daughter, and Tevye thinks he's talking about his milkcow is a perfect example. Norma Crane (what a sadly underused actress who died tragically young) is also superb as Tevye's wife Golde, the grumpy old shrew with a heart of gold. The scenes where she and Tevye re-evaluate their marriage ""Do you love me?"" and where she tells him tearfully that her third daughter has married against their will is profoundly moving. All three elder daughters (Rosalind Harris, Michele Marsh and Neva Small) are very well cast. They are not made up to look like fresh new Hollywood starlets; (manicured eyebrows, make-up, lipstick and bangs) they resemble real, plain, ordinary farm girls with freckles, moles, etc.) Usually, I like to see the actresses prettily made up, but here the gritty realism works perfectly. Leonard Frey is solid as Motel the Tailor. If I don't give him the Supporting Actor nomination he recieved, it is not because he is bad but simply because he never really stood out to me in anyway. Molly Picon is hilarious as the eccentric matchmaker Yente. Even in the bleakest moments, she can still find room for a joke. ""Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly been the Garden of Eden.""

The best (and most powerfully done) scenes were:

1. When Lazar Wolf tells Tevye how lonely he is and how he wants to marry Tzitel and Tevye thinks he's talking about the milkcow he wants to buy.

2. Tzietal and Motel's wedding. ""Sunrise Sunset.""

3. When Golde runs to her husband with terrible news-Chava has married a Gentile. He tells her Chava is dead to them and she must forget her. Golde cries and trembles all over. That part was very emotionally draining.

4. When Chava comes back with her new husband to say goodbye and Tevye ignores her. The expression on Golde's face during this scene is well worth watching. Like Topol, Norma Crane could do more with a mere look than many actresses can do with a whole script.

5. When Tevye and Golde think back over their arranged marriage and discover that they've learned to love one another. ""Do you love me?""

The musical score was one of the oscar winning features. It deserved it because it was magnificently orchestrated and did a great job balancing the sad and humorous. Oswald Morris' autumn and winter cienematography contains muted, subtle shades of yellow, orange, green, brown, black and white.

The only percivable flaw I can find is that some scenes go on a little too long. You could probably cut out fifteen minutes and it wouldn't hurt. One such example is the opening sunrise. We get three minutes of a town's sihlouette before Tevye's narration. The ending is also too drawn out. When Tevye picks up the wheelbarrow with all the family's possessions, he says to his family ""Now let's go."" and they leave the house. We get another shot of the two youngest daughters opening the gate for him. That would have been the perfect place to wrap it up. But instead we get a series of shots of the other Jews leaving their homes with the constable inspecting them on his horse while the dirge-like ""Anatevka"" song is repeated over and over. The film editor didn't have to do this because we already know beforehand the villagers of Anatevka are leaving their homes.

I recommend this film. Great for discussions and more deep than your average musical. Five Stars.",1367107200,,5636,4.77025641025641

At 3 hours long, this movie takes dedication, as I feel I have other things I could spend that time on, but it was not time ill-spent. I really enjoyed it.

The main character is a likable peasant Jew, who is desperately clinging to the old ways while the world he knows is rapidly disintegrating and disappearing.

This film compares to the live Broadway musical, with memorable performance moments.  Topal's acting endears us to Tevia even all these years later.  Norman Jamison's film effects capture the live musical well and creatively.  The cinematography is beautiful; I expected to off-put by antiquated film effects, but it is alarmingly realistic.  This must be digitally remastered as it is sharp and clear even on our large screen.

Creative movie-watchers will enjoy the performance techniques.  The issue is that our contemporary audiences process film effects differently than in the 1970s.  Therefore, it can be distracting from the great and gutsy story and music.  All said, the music still goes into the ""gut""; and you would be hard-pressed to find someone not walking away mumbling-- or even outright singing-- the addictive music.

Our children are nine and thirteen and loved the story; it gave us lots to discuss about the historical time, prejudice, injustice, priorities, family love... we're still talking about it.

As for myself, MY opinion is one of deep pity and admiration. The reasons for my pity speak historically for themselves... the admiration can be laid at the feet of their tremendous courage, world-changing contributions to the arts, sciences and humanities IN SPITE OF the causes of my pity.

The milkman Tevye (Topol) acts as storyteller as well as being the main character. The film was made in 1971 from the Broadway production of 1964. The story itself is characteristically light-weight, as the focus is on the music and dancing - which are excellent. The plot is about Tevye's efforts to get his daughters married off, preferably to rich husbands who can provide for them. The Jews have always attached great importance to their traditions in order to maintain the stability of their way of life. But now the Jewish persecutions in Russia are threatening their wellbeing and in the end they are forced out of their home, Anatevka.  Tevye's headstrong daughters also want to marry the men of their choice rather than those chosen for them by the Matchmaker Yente. The music was composed by Jerry Bock with lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. The screenplay was by Joseph Stein, from the story `Tevye and his Daughters' by Sholem Aleichem, so it has a very authentic Jewish atmosphere.

144731,5,0792838955,"I just watched Fiddler on the Roof for the first time.  I watched it on the suggestion of a friend, a man who was born in Poland during the interwar period into a very religious, observant Jewish family.  His descriptions of his close-knit, loving family and its values, steeped in rich tradition, is something I find both enchanting and heartbreaking.  Knowing that a beautiful way of life was destroyed, starting with World War I and crushed during the Holocaust, makes me want to learn as much as I can about it before everyone who experienced it firsthand is gone.  When I told him that I wanted to know what life was like in the Shtetl, he told me to watch Fiddler on the Roof.

I am not a lover of musicals in general, but this one captured my heart; I was enchanted and wrapped in the colorful and warm world of Tevye's family from beginning to end.  I loved seeing the world of the Shtetl, which I have read a lot about, come to life.  Being a musical, I'm sure it's not completely accurate, but many of the scenes were familiar to me from my reading.  To me, the story is about the pain, inevitability, and hope that goes along with change.  It's the beginning of the end of Tevye's idea of family; his five little girls who strain against the confines of tradition as they grow up and fall in love with men who aren't chosen by their parents.  It's the beginning of the end for his community, as the world is quickly modernizing and the ever-present anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe intensifies.  It's the beginning of the end for his very way of life.

The music was absolutely wonderful.  I especially liked ""Tradition,"" which makes me smile whenenver I think about it, and the lovely ""Sunrise/Sunset,"" so sweet and hopeful.  It's a love story, and a history lesson, a plea for tolerance and a bittersweet glimpse of a beautiful way of life, all wrapped up in a magical, colorful, richly rendered and beautifully performed musical.",1345507200,4,1942,4.57514450867052

144759,5,0792838955,"First saw this movie when I was too young to appreciate it.  It must have been the 1960s version which starred Zero Mostel.  All I've recalled about it these years hence has been just two details: how Tevye spent his troubled days talking familiarly with God (or was, you might say, a very early practitioner of ""the presence of God"") and how he once said to God:  ""I know we're the chosen people--but why don't You choose somebody else sometime?""

Lately spending time viewing old musicals that I either saw a long time ago or never saw at all, I came across this 1971 version.  From beginning to end, was surprised to find what a GREAT movie and musical this is!  Am so glad I didn't miss it--it's certainly one of the most excellent movie-musicals I've experienced.

So many good songs with both interesting and funny lyrics, but as for fine music, it would be utterly fulfilling if one viewed no more than just the preface song ""Tradition"" followed by the Fiddler's solo at the very beginning of the action.  What an exquisite musical opening!

The words of the ""Tradition"" song bear careful attention as they establish the foundation for the story that lies ahead.  ""Tradition tells us who we are"" (is the source of identity and customs), and ""tells us what God wants us to do."" ""Without Tradition, we would be as shakey as the fiddler on the roof.""  Challenges to Tradition in this story arise out of a determined loosening by the young people of the usual strictures surrounding love-and-marriage.  The challenges place pressure upon the ""Papa"" figure Tevye who manages to find justifications for bending and bending, and then refuses to bend any farther.

All the actors/characters are engaging.  I enjoyed especially how the character of the ancient rabbi was interwoven into the story from time to time.  The whole village turned to him as its ultimate authority figure--He remained dignified even if he was a doddering, almost comical spiritual guide, very lovable in his unpretentious simplicity.  And the match-maker, lovable too but a character who tended to drag in some dreadsome prospects to the hearts of the young girls.

With the thwarting of the match-makers role and Tevye's as the giver of marriage permissions, Tevye does some of his typical out-loud reasoning about this disturbance of the rightful traditions.  He asks God who was the match-maker in the Garden of Eden and then realizes ""YOU were!""  He is able to relax, accordingly.

Of course, there is great tragedy in this story--and yet the fiddler with his irrepressibly high-hearted music is always apt to appear as a foil to it.

(I wonder what was the exact symbolism of the fiddler in the original story....)

Amazon's review and those of other reviewers here are informative and express excellent accolades so there's no use in me rewriting them in my own words.  I'll end by recommending the reader to them for further reading.

(My version of the movie was on 2 VHS tapes and it ran about 3 hours long.)",1337385600,,2992,4.8101761252446185
144760,5,0792838955,"This movie is a pure joy to behold. Topol really makes the character of Tevye his own (no disrespect to Zero Mostel intended). The performances by all actors are second to none. In this day of Hollywood blockbusters bent on entertaining audiences with violence and nudity and vulgarity, it is so refreshing to see a movie with such a timeless and universal story. Fiddler on the Roof makes life look so simple and wonderful.  For example, when Tevye receives the news from the Russian officer that there is a ""demonstration"" imminent (a pogrom), Tevye proceeds to dance with the Fiddler, symbolizing the Jewish resolve to find joy in even the darkest of times.  Tevye repeatedly shows his humanity in this film, to his wife, his friends, to a complete stranger who shows up in town one day (and ultimately marries one of his daughters), as well as to his daughters themselves.  If only life today in the 21st century could be so simple, we'd all be much better off.  The music is also a joy to behold.  The ending is sad, though not tragic, and shows us that when faced with difficult circumstances in life, there is always a chance to move on with our lives and our families intact, and make our lives better, as is symbolized by the Fiddler following Tevye and the rest of the townsfolk away from their beloved Anatevka.

144798,2,0792838955,"My star review is based on this Blu-ray, not the film.

I did NOT notice the audio syncing problems that others have commented on.  I'm thinking that might possibly be a problem with specific players (older ones?) playing the disc.  Don't know - all I know is no syncing issues jumped out at me.

What I do know is this Blu-ray has:

1) Poor picture quality. Perhaps it is because I just recently watched the Sound of Music Blu-ray which was STELLAR, but from the opening scene of this I was VERY disappointed in the picture quality.  Very heavy pixelation.  Honestly it looks like they didn't remaster at all and just tried to plop the source material into HD without any kind of help for such an old film.  I really am thinking that's pretty much what they did.  The colors were alright, and there were some scenes where you could clearly tell that this was indeed HD.  But unlike The Sound of Music, those scenes were few and far between.

2) Poor audio mix and options.  This thing comes with a 7.1 DTS-HD mix and that's the only English audio option available (minus the commentary of course).  Maybe if you have a 5.1 or 7.1 setup, it sounds great (others have seemed to imply it does).  I watched with a Stereo setup and I can tell you that this 7.1 mix does NOT downmix very well to 2 channel stereo.  Again, unlike The Sound of Music, which did do so nearly flawlessly, this one didn't.  It sounds like they moved a lot of stuff at least partially into other channels that you don't really hear very well because they didn't appropriately mix them in the main L/R channels.  The levels themselves are also really soft (I had to crank my volume WAY up) to even be able to listen.  I like Blu-rays to have lossless 5.1 or 7.1 mixes, but if they're not going to ensure it also sounds decent in stereo, then they need to include a different audio option (i.e. Dolby 2ch) that does.

3) A non-common type menu.  Doesn't use the standard type interactive menu we've all grown used to, but rather a text-only ""pop up"" menu.  For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to get to the menu to access the special features - the ""menu"" button on my remote did nothing and the disc instantly starts playing the film when it is inserted.  After some searching online, I discovered it uses a ""pop up"" menu.  I did see a ""title/pop up"" button on my remote (far away from the menu/navigation buttons) and when I pushed it, low and behold, a menu did indeed pop up where I could access the special features.  Clearly the pop-up menu option is a way for disc manufacturers to avoid the expense of having to create those full-color, custom interactive menus, but can instead just program these text-only pop-up menus to jump to features on the disc.  Fine by me, but it would be very helpful if they would bother TELLING YOU on the packaging that it is a ""pop up"" menu that requires accessing it in a different way, especially since most people are not even remotely familiar with this.  I know out of the Blu-ray's I own, it is my first experience with it.  Before realizing what was up, I was frustrated - frustrated enough to look into returning the disc!  Given that's what I did (and I'm actually a ""techie""), I would expect this mistake alone to lead to people unnecessarily returning these discs and costing the manufacturer serious money.  I hope they realize that.

Bottom line: I've never watched the DVD so can't comment too much on comparison between the two, but I would think it entirely possible that a person could just stick with the DVD and probably not be missing too much and possibly might even enjoy it more.",1329264000,19,3622,4.4522003034901365
144799,5,0792838955,I already have this on DVD and was hoping it was now sold in Bluray.  This is one of my most favorite films that I continue to watch every year or two.

144800,3,0792838955,"My only complaint is that with subtitles on, there are no subtitles to the words of the songs. That's a big chunk of the dvd, since it is a musical. Perhaps I need to look into a different, more recent version of the dvd?",1328659200,2,221,4.045454545454546
144801,2,0792838955,"I really wanted to love this Blu-ray. I had waited for years for a really good, clean, crisp version of Fiddler On The Roof to come out. It is one of the best movie  musicals of all time.  I was so disappointed I just wanted to kill myself. This Blu-ray technically is exactly what the folks at the movie company wanted it to be. Unfortunately, it isn't what the movie buying public and consumers of Blu-ray products wanted. When we bought our Blu-ray players we wanted clean.  We wanted crisp. We wanted a sharp picture, with vivid colors. Then the restoration technicians produce something like this. How can people just completely and thoroughly miss the point?

First let's talk about the good things. There are some nice extra features on this Blu-ray. I love the discussion with John Williams about adapting the movie music for the big screen. It was also good reminiscing with the daughters.

Another one of the good features is the sound quality. If you shut your eyes, and don't try to listen and watch at the same time, the soundtrack and the quality of what you're listening to is pretty astonishing considering the age of the material. It would have been nice if they could have synched the audio soundtrack to the video but apparently that was a little too much to ask for in this version. Amazing. They can take the Sound of Music, or something as bad as the movie version of South Pacific, and make you feel like you're watching a movie that was released two weeks ago. Then they take a movie as important as Fiddler On The Roof and can't even sync the sound and the picture consistently throughout the film. For all of the discussion about preserving the original intent of the director, I'm sure Norman Jewison really intended to have the sound and the picture sync together no matter how many nylon stockings he put over the camera lenses.

Now, let's talk about the video quality. The colors are actually pretty good. Nice saturation...nothing too faded, no color shift, etc. So what the heck is all this garbage about soft focus, nylons, trying to give the overall feel of a flesh tone? But on the whole, the Blu-ray version is actually worse video quality than the DVD version that was done five or six years ago. The bottom line is, in all honesty, they just messed up and messed up badly. The DVD version issued with this release is easier on the eyes than the Blu-ray. They should have just made Fiddler look as good as The Sound of Music or any of the other recent restorations of movie musicals from the 60s and 70s, instead of trying to do an artsy historical restoration that added nothing to the film. This restoration actually degraded the quality of the film, and I hope is not the last revision of one of the finest movie musicals ever made.

This, unfortunately, maybe one of those movies that just doesn't make the jump to Blu-ray. If that's the case here, that's okay. But in the future I wish they would put some kind of warning on the label to alert the consumer that they're buying a blurry version of an old movie who's audio is out of sync with the video.

Funny. I buy a steam iron and I expect it to be perfect. I buy a car and I expect it to be perfect. And for it to have the features that I paid for at the dealership. Why can't the movie studios the same thing for its consumers? It's one thing not to like a movie after you leave the movie theater. We sort of expect that sometimes. But for an established movie, and a Blu-ray release to fall this short... Somebody really should get beat with a lamp cord. If it is available, buy the DVD version contained in this release. Skip the Blu-ray.

And for those who already purchased the Blu-Ray...there is hope.  No you haven't had a stroke.  It's made that way.",1328486400,25,3755,4.4751461988304095

It's wholesome, uplifting, enchanting, thought-provoking, and quite telling of how it was for Jews back in old Russia (and elsewhere).  I now see why people speak so highly of the movie.  You've a family, devoutly Jewish with applicable tranditional behavoural restrictions and customs.  Throughout the movie, we witness those traditions being challenged and defeated by the daughters.  The struggle pulls the family apart, only to be held togther by the love of family. The fiddler's role is the metaphorically portray the Jewish heart, and core strengths, values, traditions, ...like a musical catalyst in moments where such things are needed.  It's all very well written and acted.
  As for the DVD set itself:  The quality is great, very clear, sound is equally clean, colors vibrant.  I have an old 'up-converting' DVD player so it may have enhanced it a little, but I doubt it (not HD or Blu-Ray).  The second disc is quite informative.  Be warned the 'making of the movie' segment has dirty langage, but is very illuminating.  The director has a foul mouth, which is in dramatic contrast to the tale he is filming.  I was hoping for scenes of Topol explaining his role, and all, but he is very absent in this.  If you watch the movie with 'Commentary' clicked on, the Director and Topol are in that...  and even there, Topol is less than informative, given his foundational role in the movie.

144952,1,0792838955,"How thoughtful of Fox to ignore the way DVD menus have been done for years and make us work so hard to find the features we paid for....  Their record with musicals on video is really bad.  One thoughtless sloppy release after another.

The Fiddler Blu-Ray was obviously not quality/compatibility checked by Fox.  When you put in the disc, after some loud pretentious self-promotion from Fox, (and remember this is NOT their movie) the movie starts.

No menu or other options, in fact, when you push the menu button, you get an error icon that means ""not allowed on this disc.""  Two discs, no extras to be found on either, and it illustrates all too well that the Blu-Ray version isn't much better than the DVD.

Update 4/38:  Well I heard something about some new Blu Ray releases not having menus intentionally (stupid idea) in favor of some pop-up stuff.

I put in the disc and hit every button on the remote until about 4 options came up in bland, boring generic text.  Selected one of the features, and then after a while tried to get the options up again.  No luck.  In fact, it locked up the player - wouldn't respond to ANY of the buttons on the player or the remote, and I had to unplug the player.  So Fox doesn't consider you might actually want to get from one feature to another.

Yeah, this is a pretty ""Foxed-up"" disc.

Don't buy it.  The movie on Blu Ray isn't enough of an improvement to warrant replacing the last version on DVD (the one with decent bass and color, where the menus and special features were easily reachable).  I'm sorry I sold my old copy of Fiddler as this one clearly isn't what it should be.

It's true about the synch problems, and the sound is also a badly mixed mess.  Apparently no one is left who remembers how stereo movies were mixed in the pre-Dolby days: three to five channels across the screen, and ONE surround.  Instead of being faithful to the intended direction of the sound, this mess mixes them all up and the surround is just an echo of the front.

And color: Tevye's dream is supposed to be in Black and White.  Period.  Whoever mastered this must've seen Schindler's List and thought the red in this scene should still be red.  Just like they saw Wizard of OZ and incorrectly assumed the B&W segments of another 60s musical should be sepia tone.

All that booming base under the Fox fanfare is nowhere to be found in the ""Tradition"" sequence where it's been on every other video release of this movie.  By comparison to Fox's pretentious fanfare, the movie itself sounds like a cheap transistor radio.  See where their priorities are?

Considering how many roadshow movies are in their own catalog, Fox still remains aggressively ignorant of what an Intermission is.  Fiddler's Intermission title from the film is missing here, replaced by a jump-cut to a bad graphic that covers the Entre'Acte music.  There is not even the slightest beat that would allow the viewer to reach for the remote and hit the pause button to do what people do in an intermission.  And that graphic is not 2.35:1, it's the old standard def Entracte title created for the old discs, stretched ridiculously out to something like 6:1.  For proof, look at the oval shape of the sun in the corner.  Very very sloppy.  All they had to do is leave the movie's original Intermission title on, let it fade out, leave at least a five second pause and run the Entracte music over black.  But they were in SUCH a hurry to cut that Intermission title off, you can even hear the sound fading out too early.

Or did they even bother to DO a new transfer for Blu-Ray?

Captions/titles: is Fox's legal dept afraid to reproduce the song lyrics because they think they haven't got the full music rights?  Dropping out the lyrics is just careless and sloppy and there is no excuse for it.

Even the packaging is a letdown compared to the DVD, which wasn't so great itself.  Fox has a long repeated habit of ignoring the much nicer original poster art for ugly generic covers that make every catalog title look like just an old movie.

Careless and sloppy is how studios like Fox will continue to handle catalog films, passing them off to some unknowing fool to handle unless someone throws some extra money at them like they did with Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno and Valley of the Dolls.  Add the dicey, unreliable and difficult navigation to the awful audio synch issues mentioned elsewhere and this is a definite No-Buy.  Until Fox admits it did a bad job and issues a replacement.

The best bass comparison is in the song tradition. I even turned UP the bass all the way to see if it was on my end - still low quality bass. What crap.

I think most people critique the VISUAL quality over the SOUND quality and that may be. People like Scott Bosco (See The Ten Commandments) and others who really KNOW and remember sound effects need to be thanked. he is 100% correct.

144995,5,0792838955,"In 1894, Sholem Aleichem would create stories about Tevye the dairyman.  Written in Yiddish, the character would be best known for the fictional memoir ""Tevye and his Daughters"" which was a story about a Jewish milkman in Tsarist Russia and the trouble he would have of raising his six daughters.

The memoir was extremely popular and it would receive a musical adaptation in 1964 courtesy of Jerry Bock, Sheldon Harnick and a book would be written by Joseph Stein.  While slightly different from the memoir, the musical would feature Tevye trying to raise his five daughters while maintaining his Jewish religious traditions but outside influences are starting to change his daughters.

In 1970, a film adaptation by Norman Jewison (""The Thomas Crown Affair"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", ""Moonstruck"", ""Agnes of God"") was created.  The film which was created for $9 million would go on to make $50 million which was fantastic for its time.

The film would be nominated for eight Academy Awards and would win three for ""Best Cinematography"" (Oswald Morris), ""Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Song Score"" (John Williams) and ""Best Sound"" (Gordon K. McCallum, David Hildyard).

""Fiddler on the Roof"", the movie is presented in two acts and incorporates music from the film from Tevye and his family's perspective.

VIDEO:

""Fiddler on the Roof: 40th Anniversary"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widesecreen 2:35:1).  The film looks absolutely magnificent and holds up extremely well 40-years later.  As what Twentieth Century Fox has done for ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", the goal was to present the film as it looked originally and that includes Oswald Morris' Oscar winning cinematography which has a unique look to it.

I did notice there were some speckles and blemishes on the film at times but considering the age of this film, during the time it was created (when studios barely wanted to give money to films as the studio system was hurting), watching ""Fiddler on the Roof"" again but this time on Blu-ray, this film looks great!  A very good amount of grain, skin tones are natural, you can see the blues clearly in Tzeitel's eyes, you can see the detail in the villages, the grime on the faces of the characters and more.

I don't think Twentieth Century Fox gave the full-on restoration and remastering like ""The Sound of Music"" and not sure how well the original negatives have held up (a lot of '70s films are not in the greatest shape when it comes to the original film and negatives and are unable to undergo any major restoration) as there are small issues of flickering, speckles and dust and a few blemishes but while not a pristine PQ, it's still much better than anything that has been released on video thus far.  The film looks great despite my minor quibbles towards the picture quality.

Fans of the film should be happy of how awesome this film looks in HD.  I was definitely pleased by the cinematography and all that research that Norman Jewison and crew did in order to capture the look and feel of the village during 1905, was quite an accomplishment and it shows in the film!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Fiddler on the Roof: 40th Anniversary"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French 5.1 DTS.  And it's one thing to have crisp and clear dialogue but for a film such as ""Fiddler on the Roof"", the one thing that you will want to hear in lossless is the soundtrack.  Jerry Bock did such a magnificent job in creating the music and working with conductor John Williams to really capture traditional Russian and Jewish themes but through lyrics by Sheldon Harnick that just want to make you smile and even laugh at times.  It's the music that I remembered back then and it's the music that continues to resonate strongly today.

In fact, I still have the musical soundtrack for this film that I purchased back in the '80s on cassette and then a CD version and it was one thing to love and enjoy the music but to hear it via lossless and to see how it was incorporated via 7.1 and hearing various instruments through the surround channel, I was just amazed.  Sound effects placed in the surround channels, especially during the more ensemble performances sound spectacular.  Once again, I was in awe of this lossless soundtrack and this is the best I have heard of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" ever!

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

EXTRAS:

""Fiddler on the Roof: 40th Anniversary"" comes with  a slipcover case and also comes with a DVD version of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" (1970's Decade Collection version).  The DVD is presented in widescreen (2:35:1), English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English, Spanish and French mono.  Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

""Fiddler on the Roof"" was a film that captured my attention at an early age and I guess you can say that I  have a connection to it as I grew up in a family who believed in tradition and in fact, even I grew up expecting family (ie. my grandmother) to arrange for me to marry someone from her country.

As the oldest of the grandkids, I was raised by my mother's side ala a Western upbringing while my father's side tried their best to instill a traditional upbringing.  And there was no doubt a conflict between which upbringing was right and which was wrong.

When I moved with my father's side of the family during my teenage years and I was pretty much stripped of certain ""American"" conveniences and had to learn how things were done traditionally and I'm not going to lie, at first I disliked it but as I looked back, I understood what my family wanted me to learn and that was tradition, learning how they were raised and to not forget those traditions because so much has changed with how they were brought up and of course, how things were going to change even further as they moved to America.  Do they worry about it or do they accept it?

""Fiddler on the Roof"" resonated so strongly with many people because not only was it a wonderful film with beautiful, catchy and enjoyable music but there is an important story behind the music about a family having to go through changes.  A father who believed in tradition, knowing how much of it is being lost and seeing it upfront, close up as his daughters, that he raised believing in tradition, now going against it.  But also seeing a land that he loved, a livelihood that he was so used to, now being destroyed by the government and literally being kicked out of the country.  We know from history that many of these Russian Jews moved to another country and many settled in the United States, while many perished and their young generation were killed during Nazi control during World War II.

So, the film had a strong story, wonderful music but to make it happen, it needed wonderful direction, location and to achieve realism and that is where Norman Jewison comes in.  Back in the 1970, the Hollywood studios were in disarray and suffice to say, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" was the only film at that time who was able to get a high enough budget to create the film and give Norman Jewison the leeway to research and develop this film.  To make it happen and he achieved it with great efficacy.  And also, Joseph Stein did a remarkable job with the screenplay.

And the interesting thing about Norman Jewison is that I can easily call ""Fiddler on the Roof"" as a masterpiece, a classic for the filmmaker but his list of accomplishments from his oeuvre as a filmmaker, as this film does standout, so does many of his other films.  But where ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is achieves success is that he had high ambitions and his crew wanted the same, to create a realistic atmosphere of and bringing that memoir created by Sholem Aleichem to life.

And even today, similar to how these FOX classics such as  ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" are easily remembered and people can still remember the music for those two films, the same can be said for ""Fiddler on the Roof"".  From Tevye's ""If I Were a Rich Man"", my favorite ""Tradition"" by the company and then my wife's favorite ""Matchmaker"" by Tevye's children and of course, along with the music comes memorable scenes and who can not forget the Tevye's dream sequence which was one of the most surprising and freaky-ish ""pre-Michael Jackson Thriller"" scenes that I have seen from a film and of course, the choreography of the ""Wedding Celebration/The Bottle Dance"".  This is one memorable movie that received a fantastic Blu-ray release to celebrate its 40th anniversary.

Is it the ultimate Blu-ray classic release?  Well, 20th Century Fox raised the bar with ""The Sound of Music"" from restoration, remastering and to presentation with its many special features.  In the case of ""Fiddler on the Roof"", although the film looks great and it's the best looking version of the film that I have seen-to-date, it does have its moments of speckles, flickering and blemishes but these are very minor and unless you are watching closely, then you will see it.  But you do get a Blu-ray and the DVD of the film.  You get the awesome special features from the 2006 DVD release and you get the newly remastered 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack.  And as mentioned, this is the best I have heard of ""Fiddler on the Roof""!

If there was one thing that I would have hoped for, it would be a major reunion of the surviving cast and crew members for the film. In 2006, we do get the three eldest daughters together but it would have been nice to have a major reunion as part of the special features and a genuine 2010-2011 special feature for this Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""Fiddler on the Roof: 40th Anniversary"" is a wonderful release and if you are a fan of the film, I'll tell you right now, this is the best looking and sounding version of the film to date.  And if you really enjoyed this film, this is a must-buy.  Highly recommended! (4.5 stars)",1302652800,8,12529,4.74815157116451

Anniversary Edition of Fiddler on the Roof Blu-Ray/DVD Combo! This set comes with two Discs. One is the movie in Blu-Ray with loads of extras & the second is the movie on DVD. As I have only viewed the Blu-Ray Disc, this review pertains to the beautifully remastered Blu-Ray version of the movie only. That said, any problems I have experienced in the past regarding the quality, or should I say lack thereof, on Blu-Ray Discs in general, have been easily rectified by updating the Firmware on my Blu-Ray player. Most Blu-Ray Disc manufacturers recommend this as do I. I am pleased to report that I had no such problems with this Blu-Ray Disc. Fiddler on the Roof is one of my all time favorite classics! In this version, the extremely talented actor, Topol, is still Papa! I absolutely cannot get over how great this film looks in Blu-Ray! I must admit that I was skeptical before viewing the film! However, I was very pleasantly surprised! The Blu-Ray looks beautiful & sounds great as well. I certainly wish I could say the same for several of my old favorites remastered in Blu-Ray. Would they all turned out as well as Fiddler on the Roof! Regarding the inquiry about this version including ""Italian Audio 5.1"", I only see the following printed on the box for the Blu-Ray: ""Audio: English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono & French 5.1 DTS"". For the DVD: ""Audio English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English Mono, Spanish Mono & French Mono"". I hope this information is helpful. This version is in Widescreen with an Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1. I must confess that I haven't the means which will enable me to watch one version of a movie directly next to another version simultaneously. However, I was unable to detect any discernible differences between my old VHS version of Fiddler on the Roof compared to this Blu-Ray version. Therefore, if there are any differences, I consider them to be negligible. As is always the case with Amazon.com, The 40th. Anniversary Edition of Fiddler on the Roof arrived very well packaged, with lightening fast speed & was very reasonably priced at the time of purchase. As it so happens, we do not have a Costco in our local area. It would cost much more than $2.00 in gas to drive to the nearest one. I highly recommend this Blu-Ray Version of Fiddler on the Roof!

144998,4,0792838955,"The new blu-ray version arrived, and my first watch was with some mixed emotions.  Colors are strong, but it seems to be a bit on the dark side to me. It is also not as sharp as I expected, and seems to be a bit soft on focus. I think I read some time ago that the film was shot through a stocking which gives it an overall cast of a flesh tone, extremely subtle, but it is there. You get a brief view of the stocking in one musical number when the sun hits the camera from the front, just for a few seconds. The package says it is widescreen, 2:35/1, but it seems to be more like 1:85/1. It hurts in some musical scenes, when I get an impression that I am not seeing all the action. The only thing that is 2:35/1 is the image shown while the intermission music is playing. I suspect this was not made from a new Hi-Def master.  I was hoping for the improvement that blu-ray made to ""An American in Paris"" and ""Gigi"", but it is not here. I am a big believer in wide screen, and want to see all of the director's creation, and not some cut off version.
As to the performance, this is one of the all time best musicals, superbly cast & photographed. I really caught the moment in time perfectly, while delivering some superb entertainment.  It's just too bad it isn't all there.

And, the story is a classic. Tevye the Dairyman is played brialliantly by Topal. You can't go wrong with this purchase.

Watching this film finally led me to wonder who had written such a great story and developed the character of Tevye. I wondered if it was the play producers and song writers or some writer. I had never heard of Sholom Aleichem. He is the creator of Tevye the Dairyman. I read the book. The character in the musical is an excellant portrayal of the character described in Sholom Aleichem's book. I am now reading another book by the same author ""The Adventures of Mottel."" Tevye is a writer's creation - and quite a creation this Tevye is. We can't forget the writers of all these great classics.

The songs written by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick are classics also. After watching it you will be humming ""If I Were a Rich Man"" for at least a week. This is a keeper. It can be watched and enjoyed over and over. It is worth every penny and I'm a penny watcher.

My wife and her sister watched it with me for their first time. Both of them were unfortunately unfamiliar with the history. It was interesting to field their questions as the play unfolded. So many of us know so little history. Once again this is a production that has everything: pathos, charm, great music, history, tragedy, philosophy, religion, hope, sadness, wit and humor. This is one that you can buy now and watch forever ... it will never get old.

'Fiddler on the Roof' is an exception to the rule, with a story that is very compelling and songs that are catchy. You will be humming them for days following watching this very special film.

Aside from a great story and music the cinematography is beautiful and as 3 hour films go, this one breezes by like a warm afternoon. I caught this film on an HD channel and it looked wonderful. I do not have any information about the various DVD editions, but if you're looking to getting into some musicals, this is a good place to start.

145114,5,0792838955,"I remember taking my parents to see the Broadway Show.  I saw that several times, then the movie when it was released.

My parents left the theater in tears (so had I).  It was so true.  My parent's parents fled Russia and they related to the film's story.  Seeing their parents lifes in their homeland was like watching a family film.  Perhaps it is a ""Jewish Film,"" perhaps it breaks through the barriers and everyone, regardless of their nationality, will feel the pain and the humor and the lifes of people who were always ready to move away from where they were to a place they don't know.

I don't believe that the film is dated.  Historical in plotline, it's not a documentary.  It's reflective of the times, customs and everyday life of the Jewish people who loved Mother Russia, but were hated by the Csar.

The Rabbi was once asked... Is there a proper blessing for the Scar?  Yes my son, the Rabbi answered.  ""May God Bless and Keep the Csar... Far Away From Us.""

The songs from ""Fiddler"" are still played at appropriate times (weddings, bar/bat mitzvas, deaths), but as far as I feel, the songs are always appropriate.

145118,2,0792838955,"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is a VERY long film of the musical. It's 181 minutes long. That, friends, is three hours. Enough! The acting is good; the musical adaptation (by John Williams) is good; the choreography (by Jerome Robbins by way of Tom Abbott) is good. What isn't good is the uncomfortable incompatibility of style: You can't mix photorealism with the intrinsic theatricality of song and dance. People in the middle of a bone-chilling Russian winter will not burst into song at a moment's notice with full (though invisible) orchestral accompaniment. And, of course, these Russian Jews wouldn't be speaking (and singing) in English. The success of such a film depends too much on our willing suspension of disbelief. That's why a musical like THE MUSIC MAN is so much more successful, stylistically. (Even the otherwise brilliant WEST SIDE STORY suffered from this dichotomy.)

These comments, of course, won't change anybody's mind about the show. It's been a classic for how many years now? But I do wish a better film could have been made of it.",1258070400,2,1051,4.937853107344632

145143,5,0792838955,"This is fantastic.  It is based on the play, which was based on the writings of Sholom Aleichem.

I heard Sholom Aleichem's granddaughter on the radio.  She had taken her mother to see the play.  The mother complained that her father, Sholom Aleichem, did not like the rich, that he would not have gone for ""If I were a rich man..."".  I have the writings, and they really are quite different.

My only bone to pick with the DVD is the lack of subtitling during the singing.  Well acquainted with the problems of the deaf and hard-of-hearing due to relationship, let me say that subtitling is not only a good idea, it's the law.  I can understand the presumed difficulty in translating Tevya's Hebrew prayer while his wife was yelling at him to see Lazar Wolf, the Russian commander's instructions before the attack on the communists, or even translating the Russian during the singing at the barroom after the engagement.  These issues could have been dealt with by transliteration instead of translation, if need be.  But why not subtitle the songs, which are predominantly in English, and are so much a part of the movie?

It's still a great DVD, although of course it takes some knowledge of Jewish and Czarist cultures to understand it all.

I also have ""The Chosen"", ""Ushpizin"", and ""School Ties"".  These first two, together with ""Fiddler on the Roof"", are a great three-movie introduction to Jewish culture.  Consider also the DVD ""A Life Apart: Hasidism in America"", narrated by Leonard Nemoy, a Jewish guy who grew up near the Museum of Science in Boston and then played Spock in the original Star Trek series.  ""School Ties"" shows more Catholic prep school culture than Jewish culture, but it makes its point.

One more thing.  For Fiddler, I have the DVD of Fiddler and the CD of songs from the 1970s together.  Amazon is using the same reviews for different ""versions"", if releasing a DVD with a CD can be considered to be a different version than the two DVDs together.  Maybe another DVD does subtitle the movies; I don't know.",1250812800,,2040,4.711864406779661

145146,5,0792838955,"An old film of the double feature time with intermission music but no exit music is a great pleasure to reminisce about these old days. But has that film aged well or just grown old?

The story is well known and the problems it contains and deals with are extremely serious. The anti-Semitism of the beginning of the 20th century in Russia, in fact next to Kiev, which makes it the Ukraine but under the Czar anyway. The various approaches are all the same in the end: traditions are the normal rule in this small community but the world is changing and many of these traditions are flying away like pollen in the wind: the matchmaker is waning out under the pressure of love, the exclusive community that does not allow any mixed activities, particularly love is breaking up on these very rocks named love, the fact that men dance with men and women dance with women falls down like a sand castle under the tide, etc.

The first daughter marries within the Jewish community to a hard working young tailor she loves, against the first agreement negotiated by her father to get married with the rich but at least middle-aged butcher. The second daughter runs after a young communist who is arrested and deported to Siberia to get married there, with her father's blessing... and permission .

This second daughter was already difficult but the young communist was a Jew. Quite different is the third daughter. She gets married outside the community, outside the faith, in the orthodox tradition because she falls in love with a young orthodox Russian. She will get her father's blessing in extreme conditions. The last two daughters are too young still to get married, and even to fall in love.

The film is rather interesting in the way it shows poverty within dignity or dignity within poverty, the way it depicts all kinds of traditions like the matchmaker, Sabbath, a Jewish marriage, bottle dancers, a very tamed pogrom episode during the marriage celebration, with some surprising anachronisms like pumpkins and corn, I mean Indian corn. These were imported from America and it is surprising they had reached the Ukraine so early and as the dominant crops of a Jewish community in a small village. But after all why not? We can and may believe in miracles.

But the best part of the film is the music, the songs, one long and haunting tune ""If I were a rich man"" that comes back over and over again. That's maybe a good song, though a little surprising and in some way a clich about the dream of all Jews to be rich one day. The constant asking God to do something for these Jews, for this one in particular speaking now hence always coming from the concerned person sounds slightly like begging for God's help and favor. This is too much centered on faith. The Jewish attitude is action first that has to be in obedience to God's commands and rules, and faith in God of course and in the knowledge that God is not at the service of the elected people who have to help themselves first, and we are back to action.

When the community gets the order to leave within three days they accept their lot, pack and go. Apparently it did not go that easy in many cases. Maybe the final images of this exodus and the very final image of the poor milk farmer and his wife and the three daughters who are left, the tailor who is the husband of the eldest daughter and their baby, the milk farmer pulling the cart with their few belongings and behind them the Fiddler who has come down from the Roof, a mythical vision the milk farmer has in his mind's eye all the time, is no longer an exodus but rather a new Diaspora of a scattered community that has become isolated individuals or families.

That makes this film mythical if not mystical and yet slightly old. We do not look at this period and at this situation with such clichs in mind. Things were hard, very violent, bloody but also collective and with a deep inner sense of resistance in the name of survival, as if God could only go on existing if the Jews did not die all of them: the survival of the elect to perpetuate God. That inner resistance is not really captured and shown and the synagogue is vacated and the rabbi goes away with the sacred artifacts without any protest, without any help from the community and he disappears in the crowd in no time.

Too bad because the film has great qualities.

No - it's not a soundtrack CD, which explains the relatively low price - it's a CD of 70's songs.

Milkman Tevye (Topol), his wife, and five (!) daughters in pre-revolutionary Russia. I remember my parents going to see this at the theater, probably back in 1971, when it was released, and listening to my mom and some of her friends swooning over Topol. I have to say, I can see their point. It's not the appearance, it's the character.

One by one, his older daughters buck tradition and choose their own husbands by falling in love: a penniless tailor, a revolutionary teacher, and a local, non-Jewish Russian boy. And despite his bluster at not being obeyed as the head of the household, one by one they twist him around their little fingers. (The last one almost doesn't succeed.) One of the sweetest moments in the movie comes when all this romance gets to Tevye and he asks his wife of many years if she loves him.

It's a wonderfully emotional snapshot of the setting--the time and the place, but it's not just historical drama. It's about the struggle to find, accept, and hold on to one's roles in the family and in society, something everyone can relate to.

The historical parts--the anti-Semitism that forced these people from their homes--were hard to watch, but important, especially if the thinking they provoke extends beyond the specific people, time, and place. The lesson is all the more powerful for being surrounded by warmth and humor.

The music is, of course, the first thing I think of, and is just perfect. Even my kids liked it, and I've heard warped versions of ""If I Were a Rich Man"" around the house a few times since we finished watching the movie.",1227052800,,1779,4.546875
145229,5,0792838955,"If you own only one classic musical film get this one first. It is a wonderful integration of music into a story. A brilliant translation to the wide screen. And Topol is outstanding in his somewhat underplayed (relatively speaking) performance which allows the rest of the cast their moments of glory. It may not represent the poverty of the Russian shtetl, but it is a warm,ingratiating story of how one man came to accept the modern world. And a little bit of ancestral cultural feeling. And shows why groups often reject change as it tears down the traditions that sustain their human pride in a dizzy political mire that was Eastern Europe for Jewry. Just wonderful technically in its use of the wide canvas of Panavision. Let's look for a blu ray DVD soon...",1226793600,,764,4.708955223880597

Her Performance group in middle school are going to present their version of this play and she wanted to see the dvd in order to understand and be able to relate to the story. I had not seen the Broadway performance of the long running version, but I loved the music and knew what the story was about. This dvd was excellent and gave me a certain warmness towards the culture that existed in the period of the story. It gave a good message regarding acceptance and forgiveness. of a sorts, towards family even though their restrictions were
not upheld. I recommend this to the whole family for its sorrows and hope.

145283,4,0792838955,"This has got to be among the top 5 musicals ever adapted for the big screen.  You could argue that this the screen version is even better than the original stage version too.  Many musicals have great difficulty in balancing the music and dance with the storyline as they are either too heavy on the one side over the other but here you get excellent music and choreography and an equally excellent storyline.

Set at the turn of the 20th century in Russia, the film tells the story of a small Jewish community struggling to make ends meet in a very harsh environment having to battle the elements as well as racism and persecution as seen from the eyes of the protagonist, Tevye, played so well by Topol who should have won the Best Actor Oscar for that year too.  The Fiddler on the Roof is a euphemism for the attempts of Tevye to hang on to the many traditions of his faith but facing a losing battle against the fast-changing modern world trying to balance the two without falling headlong on either side.  This is not a new thing for the Jewish community which also had to fight against Hellenism from the time of Alexander the Great for example in having to struggle against the ""corrupting"" influence of the secular world on the hearts and minds of the youth.

Tevye although a firm believer of his faith and traditions is also a loving father and his ability to look beyond strict adherence of the law and to understand the spirit of the law instead helps him to overcome in most part the attacks on his traditional beliefs when each of his first 3 older daughters decide to choose their own spouses.  This movie is 3 hours long and yet it is so enjoyable that I didn't even feel the length and the Intermission at the middle of the movie actually irritated me rather than giving me a sense of relief at the break.  The anamorphic widescreen presentation as well as the brilliant scoring and camerawork makes this an unforgettable cinematic experience.

The only downside about this dvd version is the unrestored picture quality which means white spots abound on most of the frames to the extent that it actually took away a great deal from the overall enjoyment of the film.  The sound quality though is very, very good having been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and is only apt that a great musical has great sound options.  The special features on the reverse side of the disc are also very good with a very good documentary:""Norman Jewison, Filmaker"" and ""Stories of Shalom Aleichem ..."" which is read by the director himself.

I'm hoping that with the advent of Blu-ray that they take the opportunity to do a proper picture quality restoration to remove all the white spots and other imperfections to do proper justice to this great musical classic.  Other than the inferior picture quality though the rest of this dvd version from the excellent sound quality to the great special features makes this a great version of how all dvds should be made.

Great movie but perhaps you should wait for another better restored picture quality dvd version either in Blu-ray or standard dvd format.",1224115200,2,3117,4.643636363636364

Fiddler on the Roof is a 1971 film version of the Broadway musical about a Ukrainian Jewish Family circa 1905 Tsarist Russia.  I normally don't care for musicals, but I really liked this one.  It won three Academy Awards, including one for arranger -conductor John Williams.  It was nominated for a number of others, including Best Picture, Best Actior Chaim Yopolas Tevye and Best Supporting Actor for Leonartd Frey, who played Motel the Tailor( both had originally acted in the musical; Topol as Tevye in the London production Frey in a minor part as the rabbi's son). The decision to cast Topol as Tevye instead of Zero Mostel was a somewhat controversial one, as the role had originated with Mostel and he had made it famous.
Recording was done at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. Most of the exterior shots were done in Croatia in Mala Gorica, Lekenik and Zagreb
The film follows the plot of ther stage play very closely, although it omits the songs ""Now I Have Everything"" and ""The Rumor"". It takes place in the Jewih Village Anatevka in Tsarist Russia 1905 and centers on the character of Tevye a poor milkman, and his daughters' marriages. As Tevye says in the introductory narration, the Jews have relied upon their traditions to maintain the stability of their way of life for centuries; but as times change, that stability is threatened on the small scale by Tevye's daughters' wishes to marry men not chosen in the traditional way by the matchmaker  and on the large scale by popgroms and revolution in Russia.  Probably my favorite songs are ""Tradition"" and ""Matchmaker"" And ""Do You Love Me""

145339,5,0792838955,"`Fiddler on the Roof' released in '71 has been called by many as a celebration of the Jewish spirit. While that is a correct perception, it's not limited to being simply a ""Jewish"" experience. This amazing film is a inspiration to all, Jew and non-Jew, serving as a universal affirmation of the inner strength and faith within each and everyone of us. The faith and traditions that make us who we are and help us face the challenges that await in this everchanging, often hostile environment.

For Tevye (Haim Topol), a poor, kind-hearted husband and father of five daughters it's his love for God and family that keeps him strong enough to face the continual trials and tribulations brought about by pressures both within his faith community as well as the greater community-at-large. His spirituality is expressed to all by his devotion and adherence to the faith and traditions of Judaism, which are personified on-screen by a solitary fiddler that only Tevye can see.

This film will make you laugh and it will make you cry as it takes the viewer through the full gamit of human emotions. Thank you Norman Jewison for directing such a beautiful film and thank you Topol for becoming the living embodiment of Tevye, Shalom Aleichem's literary creation.",1196640000,11,1255,4.887323943661972

The basic premise is the breaking down of ""old-school"" traditions and incorporating new ones. With mature family members helplessly watching those previous barriers fall, in spite of their own point of view.

It takes the example of three daughters, in this particular family and setting, to demonstrate how far the breaking down of those barriers go. Each asking for just a little bit more compassion, understanding, and love.

The movie sets are exquisite and I don't use this term lightly. Even though it happens around a poverished village, it goes to show how rich and rewarding people can still live within those realms.

The music is so apart of the story and general mood, it doesnt matter if one is a movie musical fan or not.

My favorite musical sequence was the part when Tevye informs his wife of a made up dream he had, which is meant to become a bad omen for an already fixed marriage plan of the oldest daughter.

But all he wishes is to be left alone to read the holy scriptures and keep his family around him, and maybe have a little money in his pocket.  But time after time he is forced to compromise his values, until all that he wishes for is gone.  And he realizes that he lost it because he compromised his values.  An important lesson, especially today.

I saw the play on Broadway three years ago.  Alfred Molina played Tevye and I loved it.  But there is no one better suited for the role than Topel.  He is Tevye.

145484,4,0792838955,"'Fiddler on the Roof"" is one of my favorite musicals; written by Jerry Bock, it was directed by Jerome Robbins on Broadway.  I loved this movie the first time I saw and heard that marvelous Jewish music, and all the times I saw it later on television.  ""Tradition"" set the tone and substance to show the audience what the Jewish story is all about, breaking traditions.  Zero Mostel played Tevye and performed in the soundtrack I own, the original LP album of the original Broadway cast recording.  The music was wonderful; the ending of the story very sad.

'Fiddler' became the longest running musical of its time until overtaken by 'Grease,' which was later overtaken by 'Cats.'  ""Matchmaker"" was another memorable song about the close-knit family getting reading for Christmas Eve when the matchmaking works most of the time.  Joe Stein did the screenplay for the movie version, which was directed by Norman Jewison.  He liked the smell of the blue candle.  It's a question of intention.  Eddie Fisher had a marvelous record of ""Sunrise, Sunset.""

Bacharach says that Chuck had to get the girl in 'Promises, Promises.'  To the song, ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again,"" it is proven that you don't win all the time.  Leonard Bernstein proposed: ""If we survive as a decent, cultural people. we'll go in the direction of decency and culture.""  Music is always about being successful.

145490,5,0792838955,"'Fiddler on the Roof' is about a humble milkman who schemes to marry off his pleasant daughters according to his family's 'traditions.'

'Fiddler on the Roof' is about a simple villager who insists that without their old traditions, he and the other villagers would find their lives ""as shaky as a fiddler on the roof.""

'Fiddler on the Roof' is about a firm believer who carries on conversations with God, gently complaining about the afflictions the Almighty had put upon him...

'Fiddler on the Roof' is about a soft-hearted father and his self awakening to a ""new tradition"" which he experiences with his three eldest daughters whose actions call for reform...

'Fiddler on the Roof' is a powerful statement about the evils of prejudice and the importance of maintaining a warm and communicative family life in the midst of severe oppression...

'Fiddler on the Roof' is about traditional values at a time, like today, when there is confusion over those values...

'Fiddler on the Roof' is about love and fear, devotion and defiance, persecution and poverty, pride and dignity, sorrow and oppression...

'Fiddler on the Roof' takes place in the midst of a hostile and chaotic environment...

'Fiddler on the Roof' could be safely placed in the great tradition of film musicals... The songs evoke happiness and tears... The fiddler's hauntingly beautiful music came from the violin of the world's greatest virtuosos, Isaac Stern... Composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick captured the drama and conflict of the story from its incisive opening to, ultimately, the powerfully silent human circle at the very end... Their treatment of the music produced some outstanding hits like 'Tradition.'

'Tradition' is more than a simple musical number... The brilliance of this song is in its ability to introduce the impoverished village and its characters - from the figure of the funny fiddler to the pathos and witty humor of Tevye, to the creaky old rabbi, to the bright-eyed matchmaker, to the sharp-tongued Golde, to the indecisive tailor, to the audacious revolutionary, to the enthusiastic butcher, to the Constable who brings that terrible order - It is the solid center of the film.. Yet one by one, the traditions that the very poor dairyman of Anatevka and his people have cherished and lived are broken during the course of the film, as marriage are no longer arranged by the 'papa,' as men and women dance together in a public place, and, most grievous of all, as children marry out of their faith... The shattering of these traditions becomes even more intolerable to Tevye in the shadow of other dangerous forces which threaten to destroy the very life he is trying to preserve...

Under Norman Jewison's direction, the entire cast delivers a depth performance and a spectacular energy that brought smiles and tears to the audience... Few musical characters are so fully realized or so deeply engaging...

Topol warms hearts and evokes laughter with his deep humanity, wisdom and humor... He brings his own magnetism and appropriate world-weariness to the role... With his raspy voice, virile appearance, and alternating expressions of compassion and implacability, he reveals his thoughts to the audience, always quoting ""the good book."" He even shakes a czarist soldier's finger rather than his hand, and questions his loyal wife after 25 years of marriage on whether or not she loves him...

Norma Crane brings out a concerned mother and a devout Jewish woman...

Molly Picon shines as the garrulous Yente, the village matchmaker who fails to arrange suitable marriages for the three strong-willed daughters...

Rosalind Harris makes her plain Tzeitel somehow beautiful... She defies 'Tradition' to marry for love rather than arrangement...

Michele Marsh is Tevye's second daughter, Hodel, the decisive young girl who follows an activist against the repressive regime...

Neva Small is both radiant and pathetic as the delicate middle daughter Chava, who unbelievably chooses love over family...

Leonard Frey is Motel, the young impecunious tailor who tells Tevye that he and Tzeitel had made each other a pledge...

Paul Michael Glaser is Perchik, the radical student from Kiev with liberal ideas, who asks Tevye's blessing, not his permission...

Zvee Scooler is the beloved Rabbi who offers this prayer for the Czar: ""May God keep the Tsar...far away from us!""

Nominated for eight Academy Awards, 'Fiddler of the Roof' proves to be a splendid achievement with its strongly emotional songs that grows out of the characters' feelings...",1167436800,,4561,5.171195652173913

Each of the daughters breaks one of the time honored traditions Tevye holds so dear. And the musical is about how he handles it. The ending is not a happy one.

It's called 'Fiddler on the Roof' because life is shaky, like a fiddler trying to maintain his balance on the roof. One slight shove and it all comes toppling down.

145602,5,0792838955,"At one time Fiddler on the Roof was the longest running musical in Broadway history.  The musical was based on the books of Sholom Aleichem.  Both the books and musical are considered cultural icons.  So to film this, Norman Jewison was chosen and despite the name he is not Jewish.

The story is sort of a Jewish version of Pride & Prejudice.  Tevye is the village milkman with five daughters to marry off with not much to give by way of a dowry.  Therefore, beggars cannot be choosers.  Marriages at that time were arranged by the family through the matchmaker, Yenta.  (Matchmaker, Matchmaker, make me a match, find me a find, catch me a catch....)

 The opening number ""Tradition"" shows the microcosm in which the characters live.  The specific microcosm is the Jewish section of a village during the last Czarist's reign.  The village has tradition for everything, ""how to sleep, how to eat, how to work, how to wear clothes"".  You may ask were did the traditions start, no one know but they are traditions.  The family is run by the father.  All major decisions are made by him.  But the mother runs the home.  The children are there to carry on traditions of the family.  But until they leave the home, the parents make all their decisions, including who they marry.

Tzeitel is the oldest daughter.  She is at the age that she must marry soon.  Yenta has found a great match, well at least he's well off.  The butcher Lazar Wolf wants to remarry and has decided that Tzeitel would be perfect.  But to Tzietel, marrying Lazar would be like marrying her father but older.  But more importantly, she has found someone that she loves, the tailor Motel.  This is not the tradition.  But the look in Tzeitel's eyes tells Tevye that she truly loves him.  So he decides that he must allow her happiness.

Now the problem is how to break the marriage agreement with Lazar.  Worse, how to tell his wife.  Tevye devises a plan, ""Tevye's Dream"".  Golda falls for it and the match with Lazar is off.

While making his Sabbath deliveries, Tevye encounters a young radical, Perchik.  He invites Perchik to say with his family for the summer in exchange for lessons for his youngest daughters.  At Tzeitel's wedding he breaks the tradition that men and women do not dance with each other and dances with Hodel.  Perchik decides his mission in the village is done and needs to go elsewhere to fight for the people.  Hodel does not take the news well, until he asks her to marry him.  The tell Tevye that they are getting married and he says no.  They explain that they are not asking for his permission just his blessing.  They are getting married no matter what he feels.  Tevye contemplates that like Adam and Eve, Hodel and Perchik have the greatest matchmaker.  And despite the traditions, he gives them his blessing.

Tevye tells Golda that he has given Hodel and Perchik his permission and asks her ""Do You Love Me?""  Perchik goes off to Moscow.  After he is arrested and sent to Siberia, he asks Hodel to join him.

While bringing the cow home (don't ask where it's been), Chava is harassed by some ""outsider"" farmers.  But Fyedka, an ""outsider"" farmer, comes to her rescue.  They begin to see each other.  After Hodel leaves, they arrange a chance meeting with Tevye.  He tells Chava that marriage outside the religion is forbidden and to never see Fyedka or speak of him again.  Chava rebels and elopes.  When Tevye is told that of the elopement, tells Golda that she is dead to him.

The Jews in the town are told that they must leave Anatevka in three days.  After a life together the village disperses.  Some  go to Jerusalem, some  go to Chicago, Tevye and family go to New York.  In the emotional end, Chava returns to let the family know they are also leaving to Krakow.  Despite everything Tevye wishes them to go with God.

This movie is one of the last great movie musicals.  Director Norman Jewison took what he learned from directing TV variety shows and the great movies of the 60's to make a truly evocative film about the oppressive life of Jews in Russia.  Even though this film is bleak it also shows the hope that all the people of that time lived with.  This is a masterpiece.

From a technical view, the score is one of the best.  Much of the production design is actual locations in Yugoslavia.  And one thing I found out from a Jewison tribute is the color was created by shooting the film through a nylon stocking.

I was lucky to see a stage production of Fiddler with Topol about ten years later.  And it confirmed that the film was an accurate reproduction of the stage show in content and feeling.

DVD EXTRAS: Located on Side 1

Commentary by Norman Jewison and Topol

DVD EXTRAS: Located on Side 2

Norman Jewison film maker - A 49 minute National Film Board of Canada documentary on Jewison and the filming of Fiddler.  This is principally about the filming of Fiddler but in the middle Jewison talks about his experiences at Universal and UA Mirsch.

Norman Jewison Looks Back - Five mini documentaries where Jewison talks about the creation of Fiddler.  These were filmed for the DVD release and are a look back. (10 minutes)

Deleted Song: Any Day Now - Created for Perchik (Michael Glaser - before Starsky and Hutch) to replace his romantic ballad Now I Have Everything.  But it was cut too.  This is sound only with stills (3 minutes).

Tevye's Dream in Full Color - Tevye's Dream was filmed in full color but then filtered to give it more of a dreamlike quality. This has an into by Jewison and also a side by side viewing of a portion of the number. (7 minutes)

Historical Background - Norman Jewison gives some historical background on Jewish life in turn of the century Russia. (12 minutes)

Production Design and Storyboards - Production and storyboards from the film and five storyboard to actual film comparisons. The comparisons are always great to see.  This shows how it was conceived and how close the actual film was to this. (20 minutes)

Original Production Notes - Normally, I skip these but I decided to look.  This is broken into four sections: casting, make-up, call sheets and shooting schedule.  The casting are appointment sheets with the names of actors (many which were unknown at that time) auditioning for parts.  Interesting names were Ron Rifkin, Rob Reiner, Richard Dreyfuss, John Rubenstein and John Ritter for Motel, Leland Palmer, Katie Sagal, Talia Shire, Darlene Carr, Meg Foster and Ann Jillian for one of the daughters.  Richard Thomas for Fydeka

Photographic Production Diary - Like everything else this is broken into subsections.  Therefore, you can choose which aspects to view.

Promotional Materials - Various print material for the original and the re release.  The best is the animated souvenir program which shows the entire souvenir program page by page.",1136246400,34,6939,4.6697019867549665
145603,5,0792838955,"Most of my life I have always hummed along to ""If I Were A Rich Man"" and ""Sunrise, Sunset"" without even knowing where they came from. Luckily for the first time last summer I was able to see the musical (with Harvey Fernstein) in Broadway, NY, and now I feel even more glad to have found this DVD version to enjoy this wonderful yet haunting musical at home. I never would have thought that this would be just as perfect as the play itself. Every actor, musical number, and scene was just PERFECT. I can't emphasize that enough. This is a perfect work of art, no other movie version should be made.

As for Tito Munoz's question of whether or not this play is even Jewish if the scenery and costumes were taken away, that's like saying if you took away the scenery and costumes from Les Miserables would it still be French. Who ever said that the events and themes in Fiddler on the Roof was exclusive to just the Jewish community? Who ever said that any events or themes in a play was exclusive to just that one community? That's not really the point; the point is that regardless if the plot or scenes are related to a certain community or event, they all center on a universal theme, and that's exactly what Fiddler on the Roof and all musicals are meant to do.",1135555200,5,1264,4.3559322033898304

145652,5,0792838955,"With so many reviews of this film already available (106 to date) there's no need for me to provide another summary of the storyline. However I would like to offer a few thoughts about what I consider to be the greatest musical of all-time.

""Fiddler On The Roof"" has been called by many as a celebration of the Jewish spirit. While that is a correct perception, it's not limited to being simply a ""Jewish"" experience. This amazing film is a inspiration to all, Jew and non-Jew, serving as a universal affirmation of the inner strength and faith within each and everyone of us. The faith and traditions that make us who we are and help us face the challenges that await in this everchanging, often hostile environment.

For Tevye (Chaim Topol), a poor, kind-hearted husband and father of five daughters it's his love for God and family that keeps him strong enough to face the continual trials and tribulations brought about by pressures both within his faith community as well as the greater community-at-large. His spirituality is expressed to all by his devotion and adherence to the faith and traditions of Judaism, which are personified on-screen by a solitary fiddler that only Tevye can see.

This film will make you laugh and it will make you cry as it takes the viewer through the full gamit of human emotions. Thank you Norman Jewison for directing such a beautiful film and thank you Topol for becoming the living embodiment of Shalom Aleichem's literary creation, Tevye.

Own It! Watch It! It Will Never Fail To Lift Your Spirits! L'Chaim!",1124668800,30,1551,4.797752808988764
145653,5,0792838955,"Norman Jewison's Fiddler on the Roof is best on the ""Shalom Aleichem"" plays and portrays the life of a poor milkman, Tevye in Russia near Ukraine. Though the movie shows the life of the Jews amidst the others, it shows the transition of life in that part of the world. The movie is wonderful in its humor, especially Tevye's conversations with God and his interpretations of the Bible. Each one of his five daughters is drawn in a different direction. The songs in the movie are beautiful and haunting with violinist Isaac Stern doing his magic. Right from ""Tradition"" which shows why he believes in his religion to the aching ""Matchmaker, matchmaker"" where you can hear the longing in the girls voices, each song is unique. The part where they dance in the bar show that the Jews and Christians then could get along too. This is accompanied by the song ""L'Chaim, to life"". Perchik, comes up with a Communist version of the bible, ""From the story of Jacob, never trust an employer"".

The humor is fantastic, when one person reads bad news, people tell him ""Why should I care about the outside world? Let the outside world grow its own head"" Now Tevye responds, ""He is right, if you spit in the air, it lands in your face."" Here Perchik says ""Nonsense, you cannot be blind to what is going on outside. "" Tevye says now, ""He is right too"". Now the first person says ""He is right and he is right, they cannot both be right."" Tevye says, ""You know, you are also right. Goodbye."" Tevye's shrewish wife Golde also does a superb job in the acting. When she tries to get Tzeitel to marry Lazar Wolf, the butcher, the job Tevye does to convince her otherwise is outrageous (""Tevye's Dream"") The Yiddish theatre legend Molly Picon comes as Yente the matchmaker, who plays a wonderful part.

When the Jews are evicted from their village Anatevka, it is very sad. They say, ""After all, Anatevka was not exactly the garden of Eden."" The longing with which they remember their times there shows us that happiness is something of the inside. While a lot of the movie may not appeal to people who may not understand the times and the context, the Tsar, the coming of the revolution in Russia and the Pogroms, those who can relate to it will adore this movie, both for the story and for the songs. However, people who are orthodox Jewish will not accept some of the interpretations in this movie. Despite this, it is an outstanding movie. Almost every song can be remembered separately. It is unfortunate that this movie won only 3 of the 7 oscars it was nominated for. All the major awards went to the French Connection. I do not think that many people remember this movie now. However, Fiddler on the Roof is a timeless classic.",1124668800,3,2713,4.557377049180328
145654,5,0792838955,"The music alone is a great reason for purchasing this film, but there's nothing like seeing songs like ""If I Were a Rich Man"" and ""Matchmaker"" performed on screen as opposed to hearing it on the film's soundtrack alone.  This superb film does a terrific job portraying turn-of-last-century Jewish life in then-czarist Russia.  A must-have for any movie collection.",1122854400,,364,5.1525423728813555
145655,5,0792838955,"I've talked to many people who do not like this film--maybe it's too gloomy or too weird.  It is one of my all-time favorites, however.  You can learn so much from this film about history and other cultures.  There are some really great (and funny) songs as well.  Is it a little strange?  Sure, if you don't know what to expect.  It's very enlightening, however, and it shows not just a glimpse of another culture, but the struggles encountered when cultures conflict.  I think we all face those situations to some extent, and this movie is very helpful in showing flexibility.  Overall, I enjoy this film immensely.  It is funny, smart and insightful.  Take a chance, and watch with an open mind.",1120089600,,698,4.647540983606557
145656,5,0792838955,"It is hard to recapture how powerfully the play and then the movie of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" permeated the culture of the sixties and seventies.  You would think that with all the hippie and free love stuff that such a traditional style musical would be so popular.  However, the traditional musical was still alive even if it was waning.  And it was a musical that so many civic groups could pull off and audiences came to every kind of performance.  Why, you ask?

Well, you have to start with the story.  It is a story of family, of tradition, of changing times.  In the sixties every family was going through the same kinds of changes.  Then there are the wonderful songs.  People could and did sing them.  How many amateur performances of ""Sunrise, Sunset"" have you heard?  I can't count that high either.  Finally, there is the magnificence of Tevye.  What a character.  You love him and feel for his plight.  The rest of his family is also enjoyable and each plays her part, but the story is for and about Tevye.

I am not sure where I fall in the range of reactions to the story, but I am one of those who thinks the daughters are wrong in their rebellion against tradition.  I like the opening number and understand the anchor and strength that come from tradition.  On the other hand, I can admit that accepting a tradition that would leave these daughters in lives of grinding poverty and with men they don't even know might not be such a wise tradition after all.  I just would like the change to be more structured.  But it never is, is it?

My favorite scene is when the idea of marriage as a love relationship finally dawns on Tevye and he asks the tough and wonderful Golde if she loves him.  She is so uncomfortable with the notion that she runs from it, but finally yields.  Wonderful stuff.  All married couples need to ask themselves this question more often.  In this recent viewing of the movie I didn't realize until I heard the words that I have been married to my wonderful wife longer than Tevye and Golde have been married!

There are several extras including commentary by the director, Norman Jewison and Topol, who played Tevye.  Quite interesting.  There are also a couple of deleted numbers and some other background material.  Strangely, there is no booklet - just the case and disk.

A fantastic movie for family viewing and discussion.",1120003200,3,2369,4.545023696682464
145657,5,0792838955,"""Some things will never change"" Tevye (Topol) shouts at one of his daughters when he finds out she wants to marry a man who is not Jewish. And that line is really the basis of the film. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is a story about where does tradition fit in a new modern world. As the times change, must our beliefs? But we can't abandon everything, because to do so would cause a void in our moral life, whatever that is. We need some sort of structure, some sort of guidlines to live by.

 Actually that description makes ""Fiddler on the Roof"" sound like a very serious movie. Well in fact it is. The musical aspect of the film though drowns that out. I think the same thing happen with a film like ""Cabaret"". Here we have two musicals that take on some very serious subjects; traditional values and Nazis, and adds music to them. What happens in the end is most people just walk away humming the songs not fully knowing what the film was trying to say.

 But if people do just walk away humming the songs does that mean the movie did a poor job of explaining what it is about? I don't think so. ""Fiddler on the Roof"" explains itself rather frankly. It doesn't hide behind its songs. And even the songs explain the film's theme. Take a song like ""Tradition"" for example.

 Many people by now know that this movie was based on a hit stage play and when released as a film was met with equal enjoyment by fans of the stage work. What some may not know is director Norman Jewison did not want to direct this film when first asked. He thought the producers were only asking him to direct it because they thought he was Jewish. When he explained to them he's not, they said we know, that's exactly why we want you to direct it.

 Jewison has directed some very good films including the Oscar winner ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", and some of his recent films have been quite entertaining, ""The Hurricane"" and ""The Statement"".

 ""Fiddler on the Roof"", according to my father, who is a musican, is the greatest musical Hollywood ever made. And the songs are memorable. My favorite is ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and almost everyone likes ""If I Were A Rich Man"".

 I think it's too bad this didn't win ""best picture"" when released. It lost to ""The French Connection"". Here would have been my choice for the best film of the year.

 Bottom-line: Besides having a great musical score ""Fiddler on the Roof"" has some serious things to say. It is a wonderful film.",1116633600,,2465,4.400881057268722
145698,5,0792838955,"""Fiddler on the Roof"" is one of the best films ever made. It is a musical with wonderful songs, but at the same time, it is so much more. First and foremost, it is a film about family ties, values, and conflicts. It is a film about love. It is a historical film. It is very funny, very witty, and very sad, all at the same time. I laughed, and then I cried. It has memorable characters: Haim Topol, who played Tevya the milkman on the stage in London, is made for the role, and has become identified with it. He portrays an authoritative, yet sympathetic father, and he is the source of many witty and very funny comments about life. Just to give you a few examples: ""Would it spoil some vast eternal plan / If I were a wealthy man?"" or ""A bird may love a fish, but where will they build a house together?"" or in attempting to explain how a certain tradition began, ""I'll tell you. I don't know.""

Norma Crane is equally wonderful in playing Tevye's wife. Life has not been good to her, and this shows, and she has never experienced romantic love. It takes 25 years to realize that she loves Tevye, to whom she was married through the matchmaker. But she is a good, loving,forgiving mother, and a devoted wife.

There are other memorable characters, such as Yente the matchmaker, Lazer Wolf the butcher, and Mottel the tailor. The three eldest daughters are beautiful and dream of a great match. Their song, ""Matchmaker,"" is one of the best songs ever written for a musical. Going contrary to tradition, each of them foregoes the services of the matchmaker and marries out of love, even if the price is poverty, suffering, or banishment from the family.

The first part of the film focuses on ordinary everyday life in the village of Anatevka. The second part dramatizes a dark page of history, as the village Jews first suffer a pogrom, and are eventually driven out of their village at the orders of the czar. Some of them head for America, others for the Holy Land, but some move to a different part of Russia or to Poland, and we cannot supress the knowledge that this is a very sad ending indeed, as we know that they and their children will end up in Nazi concentration camps.

The film is replete with humour, wit, love, and great songs, among which ""Tradition"" (accompanied by wonderfully clever film shots, ""Matchmaker,"" ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" ""To life,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" ""Anatevka,"" some merry, some hearbreaking, all utterly enjoyable and touching.

Pay attention to the opening shot of the film, it is absolutely brilliant. The cinematography is splendid, the colours are strong and fresh. The locations are beautiful and faithfully recreate village life.

The second disc is replete with information, such as a documentary on the shooting of ""Fiddler,"" on location in Yougoslavia, in 1971, which is excellent and in parts brought me to tears, as the director talked about the historical context of the film; a shorter interview with the director, Norman Jewison, reminiscing about the making of this film (by the way, he recounts that the producers at MGM thought he was Jewish, because of his name, and were surprised to learn that he is actually Christian); authentic period photographs; the director reading from two stories by Shalom Aleichem; a deleted song, ""Any Day Now,"" which I regretted they deleted; posters, trailers and TV spots.

I really urge you to buy this DVD, it is a film you will constantly love to rewatch, and to which you cannot remain indifferent. You will laugh, cry, be entertained, as well as deeply touched. It is one of my most treasured DVD acquisitions, and one that will never lose its grip. I had seen it on TV several times before, and I still wanted to purchase it so as to be able to return to it time and again.",1116460800,5,3765,4.618834080717488

145700,5,0792838955,"Although Fiddler on the roof is the story about a jewish family living in a small Russian village at the turn of the 20th Century, it really is a history of the jews of the last hundred years. Since the expulsion from Judea the jews wander Europe, sometimes tolerated but never welcomed.  In Russia they endure anti semitism yet manage a normal happy life.  The film starts off showing how ""tradition"" is what has kept the jewish people together yet separate from the outside world for two thousand years.  But it is a new world that is coming, a world of communism and fascism, of the growing of individuality and humanism, of new technologies (the sewing machine) and globalism. One by one this jewish family is affected by these new ideas. The first daughter chooses the man she will marry (but gets permission from her father), the second daughter chooses a communist jew as a husband and merely asks for her father's blessing (reluctantly he grants it), and the third daughter marries out and only asks for understanding.  Ultimatly, the jews of the whole village are forced into this new world whether they like it or not.  Some will hold onto their traditions but others will become part of the new World.

  Fiddler On The Roof is a musical masterpiece, though most of the great songs appear in the first half.  Anyone interested in musicals, judaism, history or great films should see this dvd.",1112918400,6,1403,4.717213114754099

Life plods on in daily grind until the day he tries to arrange a marriage for his oldest daughter only to find she has promised to marry a local tailor. This goes against everything he believes in and his struggle to come to terms with the changes around him is both hilarious and poignant to watch. I'd defy any parent not to get emotional when watching 'Sunrise Sunset' being sung at the wedding.

When daughter number two decides to follow the poor student she loves to his exile in Siberia, Tevye is still upset but more philosophical than previously. However, daughter number three, the apple of his eye, has chosen to marry a Gentile, to turn her back on the Jewish faith. His torment is palpable as he tries to reconcile his beliefs with his love for his daughter.

Set during the time of the Russian Pogroms, where Jews were being driven from their homes and into exile, this is at times a very sad film. However, for the greater part of the film, Tevye's exuberance is infectious and the music is wonderful, such songs as 'If I were a Rich Man', 'Matchmaker, Matchmaker', 'Wonder of Wonders', have you tapping your feet.

Needless to say, this movie does. It makes you think about life on so many levels. It also addresses the deepest love that anybody ever has... I am talking about the love a parent has for their children.

It has always amazed me how Hollywood makes so many movies about romantic love, which is so much weaker than the love a parent has for their children. If they really want to make good movies, they should focus on the parent-child

relationship.

To top it off, this movie inspired me to love God more. Tevya talks to God like a friend, and he really inspired me to love God as my friend and talk to Him kind of like Tevya. What more could you ask for in a movie?",1102204800,10,905,4.039106145251397

145730,5,0792838955,"Like a great conductor conveys the essence of a composers emotions through interpretation and conducting, this film was created, much like a symphony coming to life, in the hands of a master film maker.
Tevye the milkman has three daughters who, one-by-one find the man of their dreams. The story is about Tevye's inner turmoil as he prepares himself to let each daughter go off into the world of marriage. Faith and tradition are everything in Tevye's life and thinking, and they surface in little chats he has with his God. His God is the sounding board for his thinking but his tradition offsets everything else. It is about the tradition of the Jewish culture and how everything must have a law and a faith to keep them together.
Norman Jewison has made some great films over his career, but for me, Fiddler is the pinnacle of his artistic achievement in musicals. It is stylishly with the flair of an artist who knows.
Music is so much of the story and Jewison has edited to the music. Unlike many previous musicals (i.e. Rogers & Hammerstein or most filmed Operas) which hold a shot for the singers and actors to move about the frame, Jewison has cut and intercut the film on the meaning of the story and the beat of the music so that the performers and the music bring the audience intimately into the lives of the characters. Fiddler shows how a creative director can construct a film to be a spectacle of congeniality of all the elements, because he knows how to tell a story visually.
This is a great film from a master filmmaker with a twinkle in his eye.",1080172800,6,1566,4.5371024734982335
145731,5,0792838955,"""Fiddler on the Roof"" is one of the greatest works for the theater of all time. The story is one of extroidinary importance, and one that has entertained ever since opening on Broadway on September 22, 1964.
The story, based on the stories of Sholom Aleichem, centers around Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman who lives with his wife and five daughters in czarist Russia in 1905, on the eve of the revolutionary period. They live in their home in the small village of Anatevka. The story is so engrossing, so I will tell no more of the plot, as to not spoil for you the joys of first viewing it yourself.
Tevye, the deeple religious milkman, is played magnificently by Chaim Topol (he is billed only as ""Topol""). Before I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was a mistake for the filmmakers to not have Tevye portrayed by Zero Mostel, who played him in the original Broadway production. I must say, however, that Topol is a marvel as the lovable Tevye. He is a perfect match to the character...his performance is both funny and touching. I laugh every time I see him dance while singing the famous ""If I Were A Rich Man"". His performance is one for the ages.
The supporting performances are all extroidinary! Norma Crane is very sincere and fabulous as Golde, Tevye's wife. Rosalind Harris (Tzeitel), Michele Marsh (Hodel) and Neva Small (Cheva) are all magnificent as Tevye's three main daughter's. Their performances are all sentimental and heartfelt. Their rendition of ""Matchmaker"" is priceless. Leonard Frey is also great as Motel, the tailor and one of the girl's love interests. Only, the way he walks and moves can be quite annoying at times. Nevertheless, he sings a great rendition of ""Miracles of Miracles"".
The songs are all composed by Jerry Bock with lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. Every one of the songs in ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is incredible. The hysterical ""If I Were A Rich Man"", one of the sweetest duets of all time ""Do You Love Me?"" and the haunting, beautifully written ""Sunrise, Sunset"".
""Fiddler on the Roof"" is an incredible story with incredible music. Th estory is very happy at times, but also very sad. I usually never cry at movies, yet several scenes made me teary eyed. Believe me, you will love this American Masterpiece. It is not just one of the greatest musicals ever written, it is one of the best movies of all-time. If you were a rich man, you couldn't buy a better show. (The DVD extras are great, also).
To qoute the New York Post, ""'Fiddler on the Roof' is like your grandmother's house: a place to renew old values and get your soul scrubbed out. If you're lucky enough to have it still, be wise enough to visit it often."" You'll be glad you did.",1070668800,3,2691,4.596673596673597

Most of the time he isn't even talking about what's going on on the screen--he's talking about other films he's done, etc. Topol's commentary becomes the same way after a while--he starts talking about his career and forgets to talk about Fiddler. Between the two of them and their redundant commentaries, it's hardly worth buying the special edition. The regular (less expensive) version will do just fine.",1070150400,6,539,4.934065934065934
145733,4,0792838955,"Lots of other reviewers have already described the plot, music, and performers in this excellent classic, so I won't re-invent the wheel here.  My 4-star rating is directed more at the technical aspects of this particular DVD edition.
To begin with, it comes on a single disk, with the movie on one side and the extra material on the other.  The disk itself is plain (i.e., no graphics) and the titles are in teeny-tiny print around the hole in the middle -- print so tiny that I cannot read it without my bifocals.  A minor complaint, perhaps, but highly relevant to the senior generation to which my wife and I belong -- the very same generation that is a big part of the market for this movie.  Frankly, this format strikes me as a cheap-out -- and why do that with such an important classic?  Especially since the list price for this DVD is $19.98, i.e. it's not exactly a ""bargain"" edition.
I would have preferred two separate disks -- even if they cost a bit more -- with different graphics on each.  So, I'm docking this edition a star for it's inconvenient format, and I certainly hope this one-disk idea does not become common, heaven forbid.
On the plus side, the many interesting ""extras"" include a very nice background piece, narrated by director Norman Jewison, explaining the history of Jews under the Russian Tzar, the ""Pale of Settlement,"" the pattern of village life, the various social strata, etc., such as portrayed in the film.  This is especially useful for showing ""Fiddler"" to gentile groups who might not even be aware that the characters are Jewish.  (REALLY!  I have actually met people who thought of Tevye and friends as generic ""Russians"" and had no idea that the movie was about Jews, even though the opening number, ""Tradition,"" features shots of Hebrew texts and synagogue art.  Then again, maybe people don't know the difference between the Hebrew and Cyrillic alphabets?)",1070064000,8,1906,4.76595744680851
145734,5,0792838955,"...and, believe it or not, saw this film for the very first time last week! I know, part of the reason has been the fact that I don't consider myself to be much into venerable musicals (although at least two of them are on my all-time fav list: see THE KING AND I & THE WIZARD OF OZ); also, clocking in at exactly three hours as this film does, I needed to build up the patience to see FIDDLER ON THE ROOF (1971).  Now that I've finally seen it, I want to see it again.
Norman Jewison (himself not Jewish, by the way, despite his name) directed this, the film version of the long-running '60's Broadway musical that had starred the legendary Zero Mostel.  I mention this fact because of the related controversy surrounding the casting of this film.  Norman Jewison had bucked the popular trend by passing on Mostel to cast Palestine-born Israeli actor Topol, who had starred in the London stage production of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF, in the lead role of Tevye.  This hurt the Broadway star's feelings badly, as Zero Mostel had basically figured that his starring in the film version was a done deal; however, his notorious tempestuousness with film directors, plus his unpredictability on the set of the Broadway original, caused Jewison to choose the better-tempered, and less-hammy, Topol instead. (The story goes that, the following year when Norman was casting his next film, JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR--another film adaptation of a Broadway musical--he called on Zero's son Josh to fill the role of King Herod.  Zero was home and could be heard shouting ""Tell him to give it to Topol's son!"" Josh got the part, anyway.)
This film, Topol and all, is a masterpiece.  It manages to tell a rather somber story while being entertaining at the same time.  It contains some rather lengthy musical numbers that only serve to enhance, not subtract from, the plot.  Most of these musical numbers became so popular that they are now legendary (the opening number ""Tradition""; ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker""; ""If I Were A Rich Man""; ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and the beautiful closing number ""Anatevka"").  This Special Edition DVD boasts excellent picture and sound quality; it certainly doesn't seem like the film was made over 30 years ago!
Then there is the casting: Topol, in an instantly-career-defining role, justifies the Mostel snub all the way (sorry, Zero) with a fully-realized performance that is alternatively amusing and engaging, introspective and thoughtful, agonizing and heart-rending.  His character, a lowly milkman, is the center of the world in which he lives.  At the beginning, he addresses us, the audience.  In the remainder of the film, he interacts with each of the other characters and, most notably, with God, to whom he addresses his pleas.  His relationship with the camera is nothing short of magical, and he was well-deserving of his Oscar nomination for Best Actor.
Norma Crane plays Tevye's wife Golde, who both loves and tolerates him, all at once.  Molly Picon plays Yente, the irrepressible matchmaker (who, in a point of irony, does not match up any of the marrying principals).  Rosalind Harris plays Tevye's eldest daughter of five, Tzeitel, in a beautiful performance of quiet understatement.  Leonard Frey plays Motel (pronounced ""muttle""), Tzeitel's betrothed, in an earnest performance that garnered him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Paul Mann plays huge, pear-shaped Lazar Wolf, who strikes up an agreement with Tevye to win his eldest daughter's hand in marriage.  His performance is so full of vitality that it's amazing to me that FIDDLER ON THE ROOF was the very last film he would ever do.  Lastly, it is of note that future ""Starsky and Hutch"" star Paul Michael Glaser (here billed simply as Michael Glaser) makes a notable film debut as Communist revolutionary Perchik, who wins the hand of Tevye's second-eldest daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh), much to Tevye's chagrin.
Tevye's striving to hang on to his Orthodox Jewish traditions while everything changes all about him--indeed, his world as he knows it goes from secure to nonexistent during the course of this film--makes up the majority of the plot.  Frustrating his good intentions are the three eldest daughters (out of a total of five) who cause his patience to be tested, his faith to be shaken.  The eldest calls into question the tradition of arranged marriages and the second calls into question the tradition of marrying an observant Jew (who himself calls into question the ancient rules of intergender public activity, such as dancing).  Finally, the third daughter Chava (Neva Small) calls the whole idea of marrying another Jew into question, which leads to some of the film's most heartbreaking scenes.  Oh, and while all this is going on, Czar Nicholas II stages pogroms against Jews in many towns--with Anatevka being next on the list.
With all of its subplots and activity, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF leaves you with much about which to think.  For all of its musical bombast, it contains much in the way of thoughtfulness.  Perhaps most importantly, it captures a people and their era that is so distantly removed from our own--and makes us care.  It also contains some beautiful music by Isaac Stern, who gives such an idelible musical voice to the titular character in this thoroughly remarkable, classic film.  The extra features on this DVD are also excellent.  This is a must-buy for all cinemaniacs.

Aside from the spirited singing and dancing, the film depicts The Bolshevik Revolution, a Siberian prison camp and generally the whole Russian Army fighting a revolution in expansive production values that at times equal the splendor of such grand movies as ""Lawrtence Of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"". As the song and dance die down, homeless Jews travel in poor caravans searching for a homeland and the Russian Army fights and falls while revolutionaries gain control over the country. This all makes ""If I Were A Rich Man"" seem a bit trite in response to the enormous historical changes taking place in the movie.

The anamorphic widescreen transfer is a welcome plus, but it seems that no attempt was made to restore the film on DVD by removing the obvious and numerous flaws in the original film print.  I'm not a video perfectionist by any stretch, but even across the living room on my small-screen (27"") TV I could easily spot the flecks, spots and other flaws in the film - and this was during the FIRST viewing!

145778,5,0792838955,"The classic story, based on the tales of Sholom Aleichem, is all about the wise, great-natured Tevye, who is a poor milkman in his Jewish village in Russia. Tevye is a kind and loving man, who loves his wife and his daughters. However, Tevye is at an important stage in his life. It's pre-revolution in Russia, and he has to come to terms with his changing lifestyle. His daughters are growing and looking for love, the pre-revolution and of course, other ties that bond into his family. Believe it or not (well, you should know) all of this works in a fine musical of morals, meaning, great character and emotion. There's a never a dull moment. It's three hours long, but it always feels far less than that to me... and I have trouble sitting for long movies.
There's no surprise why this movie was nominated for eight Academy Awards, it's just really good and well made. Truly one of the greatest musical movie adaptions ever. As I said, this movie goes really quick for me. Every scene in this is necessary and the dialogue just flows well and sounds great, all from Joseph Stein. There's just this great knack to it and it really comes to be an incredible and very enjoyable story.
This musical is quite memorable as far as songs go. Yes with my sister I heard 'em all dozens of times, but the tunes are rather catchy and sound traditional. They just fit really well and come up at the right times. From the grand opening ""Tradition"" to ""Matchmaker"" to ""Sunrise, Sunset"" there's simply a greatness to them that can't be denied. They have messages and go with what's going on. The lyrics go well too and it's just a fine fit for it all. Really memorable tunes in all of this.
The performances here are great, especially the Academy Award nominated Topol as Tevye. Topol is just a great fit for the role as he really brings the character to full life. The strength, the happiness and the conflicting emotions. I don't know why, but Topol just has this real strong presence on the screen that's such a joy to watch. He's brilliant in this role as he really does capture everything in the role. He makes it feel and seem so real. Truly an impressive performance. The supporting cast is also good and play off Topol well. The singing voices are great too.
Still, I think the real star of all of this is Norman Jewison. His directing skills, which have always been strong as he's done great films, but here he really creates a fantastic movie here. The way he conveys and sets up his shots as he captures the characters actions and feelings as we're viewing it all through our eyes. The editing and pacing is also fantastic.

145784,5,0792838955,"I hadn't seen this movie for about 15 years, of course on TV.  I'm sure it was at that time severely edited, probably down to only a couple of hours as TV movies are like that!  I didn't think much of it until I saw it on the shelf at the movie rental place.  I recalled that I loved the play, so I rented it.  I was blown away by this movie and was moved to tears and laughter!  There are several scenes that are so well-done that I would call them the best scenes ever made, of all time!  The scene where Tevye is recalling memories of his little girl, whom he has now lost forever to the Russian, is one of the best pieces of filmmaking I have ever scene.  The camera shows a closeup of his face and them pans slowly away.  I have never seen better acting than at that moment.  Tevye's eyes actually show the severe grief he is feeling.  What an amazing actor!  The whole movie is just amazing and wonderful.
The scenes where he is debating with God ""on the other hand"" about whether he should accept the marriages of his daughters were some of the best moments in filmmaking also.  I would also be moved to tears when he would say, ""Look at my daughter's eyes, she loves him, so hopeful...""  Those were really touching moments.  It was wonderful how the filmmakers would move Tevye farther away from the daughters at those moments, as if he were far away, deep in thought.
The whole movie is beautifully made.  The clothing and settings are very appropriate and don't give the viewer any indication of when the movie was made (like some 50's movies do with the heavy makeup the women would wear).  The dancing was excellent.  The characters were very funny and likeable.
The DVD is just amazing.  I love widescreen and also love all the extras on this DVD.  I wish they hadn't cut the song ""Any Day Now"" because the scene is really setting itself up to lead into a song, but then suddenly they are at the bridge with Papa.  The song is a fine song and would have worked well, but I suppose it was in the interest of time that they deleted it.
I will definitely purchase this DVD since it's a movie that can easily be watched again.  Its quality also will never become outdated.",1035504000,6,2181,4.296568627450981
145815,5,0792838955,"Without a doubt, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is one of the best musicals ever filmed!  Directed by the Norman Jewison, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is based upon stories written by Sholom Aleichem (1859-1916).  The film follows the lives of Tevye (a poor Jewish milkman, played by Topol), his wife Golda (played by Norma Crane), their five daughters and other residents living in the small, Russian village of Anatevka in pre-revolution, Czarist Russia in 1905, where they wrestle with issues of racial & religious intolerance and modern ways infringing upon their traditional ways & values.
Tevye's three oldest daughters are Tzeitel (played by Rosalind Harris), Hodel (played by Michele Marsh) and Chava (played by Neva Small).  Against tradition and unknown to Tevye and Golda, Tzeitel has maintained a secret romance with Motel (played by Leonard Frey), a poor tailor. They promise one another that they will one day marry, but Golda intends for the local matchmaker, Yente (played by Molly Picon), to find a wealthy man for Tzeitel to marry.  Yente comes through with a proposal from the town butcher, Lazar Wolfe (played by Paul Mann), who is probably older than Tevye.  Tzeitel is, of course, very upset when she is informed that she is to marry a much older man that she doesn't love; but Motel (who previously could never find the courage to stand up to Tevye) finally announces to Tevye his and Tzeitel's desire to marry.  Tevye cannot believe what he hears because it is completely untraditional for two young people to make such a decision for themselves; but when Tevye realizes how important Motel is to Tzeitel, he relents and gives them his blessing to marry.  Unfortuneatly for Tevye, he made a bargain with Lazar Wolfe for him to marry Tzeitel, but Tevye thinks of a clever scheme to renounce the agreement.
Tzeitel and Motel marry in a beautiful ceremony and a huge reception with the town's entire Jewish population follows. During the celebration, a group of non-Jewish residents from the town interrupt the celebration and begin to destroy the wedding gifts, as well as burn and loot many Jewish homes & businesses.  Tevye, who is friends with the town's non-Jewish constable, is stunned when he sees the constable leading the ""pogrom"" (Russian word for riot), but the constable had no choice as he was ordered to carry it out by his superiors.
The first act of the film ends, but the second act finds Tevye facing even more threats to his traditional way of life by his next two oldest daughters; but these issues are small in comparison to the final insult that hits all ofthe Jewish residents of Anatevka: an expulsion order from the Czar.  Tevye, Golda and their two remaining unwed daughters, as well as all of the other Jewish residents of Anatevka are forced to leave their home behind to find new lives elsewhere.  The film ends.
Throughout the film, a number of very memorable songs are heard:
* ""Tradition"" which introduces the entire Jewish community of Anatevka, as well as their daily life.
* ""Matchmaker"" as sung by Tevye's daughters exploring their fantasies and the possible consequences of potential husbands that Yente the matchmaker might bring.
* ""If I Were a Rich Man"" as sung solo by Tevye, expressing his desire to be wealthy instead of a poor milkman.
* ""Sabbath Prayer"" as sung movingly by Tevye and Golda describing their desire for their daughters to have good lives and husbands.
* ""To Life"" (""L'Chayim"") as sung by Tevye and Lazar Wolfe and later joined by many of the town's men expressing their joy over a new marriage.
* ""Miracle of Miracles"" as sung by Motel, celebrating Tevye's blessing for him to marry Tzeitel
* ""Tevye's Dream"", as sung by Tevye, Golda, Golda's dead grandmother (played by Patience Collier), Lazar Wolfe's dead wife Bona Sara (played by Ruth Madoc) and joined by the town's dearly departed as part of his plot to show Golda who Tzeitel needs to marry.
* ""Sunrise Sunset"" as sung by Tevye, Golda, Hodel, Perchik (a man with radical ideas, as played by Paul Michael Glaser) during Tzeitel's marriage with Motel.
* ""Do You Love Me"" as sung by Tevye and Golda, questioning each other's love for one another.
* ""Far From the Home I Love"" as sung by Hodel when she leaves to be with Perchik, who she loves and who is arrested and sent to Siberia for protesting against the Czar.
* ""Chava Ballet"" as sung by Tevye, as he distresses over Chava's unwelcome and unapproved marriage to a Russian peasant.
* ""Anatevka"" as sung by Golda, Tevye, Yente, Lazar Wolfe, the Rabbi's son (played by Shimen Ruskin) as well as the entire town when the learn of their expulsion from Anatevka.
It is no wonder that ""Fiddler on the Roof"" won 3 Oscars for Best Cinematography (the film was shot mostly in Croatia, former Yugoslav republic), Best Original Music (courtesy of John Williams) and Best Sound.  The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Topol was nominated for Best Actor, Leonard Frey was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Norman Jewison was nominated for Best Director.
Though the film is long at 181 minutes, time passes quickly as you are caught up in the lives and music of Anatevka's residents.  ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is a classic, immortal film and that I am very happy to own in my personal DVD collection.  Extras on the DVD include the deleted song ""Any Day Now"" as sung by Perchik (Paul Michael Glaser), wonderful commentaries by Norman Jewison and Topol, a documenatary about Norman Jewison (who also directed ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", ""Moonstruck"" and many other films), stories of Sholom Aleichem as read by Norman Jewison and a historical background presented by Norman Jewison.",1035244800,36,5651,4.843523316062176

Important note for overseas viewers:  I am in Morocco, and have multisystem machines, which include NTSC.  However, when I ordered this DVD, I discovered that my machine must only contain the CANADIAN version of NTSC, which is a lower number than the U.S. version.  So it only plays in black and white on my television.  Before your DVD player (or video player, if you order that version) has the 4.43 NTSC.

The songs and musical routines are fun, memorable, sometimes even pretty, and many have become classics.
The best thing is that this Special Edition DVD really does offer some special bonuses, not least being a full-length version of the film with Topol's running commentary, which reveals some genuinely interesting information about the making of the movie and the actors, etc.. You also get commentary from the film's director, as well as a never-before-released song that was edited from the film.

145824,5,0792838955,"This movie musical is better than the stage version. It's realistic, the animals are real, and you get to see more of the village. I have a feeling that the jar that Tevye was looking into at Lazar Wolf's house was an urn that held the remains of Fruma Sarah despite the fact that she bursts out of a grave in the dream sequence. Maybe it was a dearly departed relative. I enjoyed the commentary in this DVD. Who would have known that the kid carrying the dog in the scene where the villagers leave Anatevka was one of Norman Jewison's sons. Who would have known that Norman Jewison was the singing voice of the dream Rabbi a.k.a. Mendel's grandfather. Who would have known that Norman Jewison sent money to Yugoslavia every month to see that the horse lived the rest of his years hapilly. You probably read the credits of Fiddler and Jesus Christ Superstar (Norman Jewison's next film which was also very realistic) and seen that Mendel was played by Barry Denem, the same man who played Pontius Pilate in Jesus Christ Superstar. I didn't. This is better than the stage show. Buy it and be careful. It's a two sided DVD like Les Miserables in Concert. The difference is that Les Mis in Concert has both acts on each side. Fiddler has the film on one side and the special features on the other.",1011657600,,1294,4.4641350210970465

The music is stunning and John Williams' orchestarations are first rate.  The cinematography captures the raw essence of the movie, rather harsh and cruel.  Perhaps the best thing in the movie is Isaac Stern's violin playing.  What a boon to have this on DVD.  The dream sequence along with fabulous dance sequences, lead me to my final conclusion that I would rate this in the top 5 movies of all time.",1009584000,8,723,4.5
145866,5,0792838955,"Fiddler on the Roof is a cinematic masterpiece.  Originally a musical, this movie is an amazing adaptation that remains faithful to the original, while at the same time not making it seem ""theatrical"" to the point where it looks contrived.  The characters are played perfectly with Topol (who plays Tevye, the poor village milkman) taking the highest honors.
Fiddler on the Roof is simply a timeless story, even if it finds itself placed in czarist Russia. The story revolves around Tevye, a poor Jew living in Russia and his struggle to stay true to his faith (and ideals) in a world that is rapidly changing.  This film follows Tevye in his journey to meld his rich Jewish past with the modern world that surrounds him. His arguments with himself (""On the other hand,..."") are priceless and allow us to relate with Tevye as he struggles with his heritage (the pogroms), his financial status (""If I Were a Rich Man"") and his family (his daughters are entering marrying age).
Ths music is wonderful.  The songs are poignant and easily remembered.  I guarantee that you'll wind up singing/humming ""Tradition"" or ""If I Were a Rich Man"" days after watching the movie. The movie itself is humourous at times, and sorrowful the next and the storyline is deep, but is not a damning social commentary.  The cinematics are also extraordinary, with the film being shot ""on location"" in Zagreb, Yugoslavia.
This is an ideal family movie, and I can remember watching (and loving) this movie at an early age.  I'm glad I purchased this movie for my DVD collection, as it will become one of my most watched (and sung to) films.  The box comes with only a single DVD, but is double-sided and contains additional footage, an additional song (cut at production) and a commentary on the movie itself.",1008460800,11,1783,4.785016286644951
145867,5,0792838955,"""Fiddler on the Roof"" has always been one of my favorite musicals.  I also believe that this is one of the very few adaptations of a Broadway musical that worked on film.  I always laugh at Topol's dramatic, yet unabashedly witty portrayal of Tevye.  Several of the supporting roles are handled rather well, namely by Norma Crane (Golde), Michelle Marsh (Hodel) and Leonard Frey (Motel).  One of the several important aspects that glue this film together is the wonderful Bock/Harnick musical score that includes ""If I Were A Rich Man"" ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and the sweet duet ""Do you Love me?""
The DVD has the film on one side (in the 2.35:1 letterbox ratio--thank god!), while the other side is chock-full of substantial extras, documentaries, as well as ""Tevye's Dream"" in full color--complete with a comparison to the final, filtered look of the scene.  One feature I particularly enjoy is a documentary on director Norman Jewison.  You really get to see the genius in his use of realism, rather than broad comedy, to bring forth a new aspect of the realities of the characters...
I recommend this DVD to anyone considering purchasing it!",1008374400,13,1138,4.901041666666667

145870,5,0792838955,"Norman Jewison chose Topol rather than Zero Mostel, the Broadway Tevye, amid the same type of controversy and hurt feelings that occurred when Andrews was snubbed in favor of Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady.""  Here, however, the casting may well have been brilliant. Topol plays Tevye with genuine anguish and anger, and not much schmaltz and schtick. The songs are also directed with the same careful reserve--contrast the almost conversational tone of ""Do you love me"" and the meditative ""Far from the home I love"" with the over-the-top sort of singing in, say, Yentl.

The careful, toned-down direction takes nothing away from the production. In fact, you can visualize the hard daily life of people in a Russian shtetl (village) and the tragedy of the forced relocation of thousands of these Jewish villages by decree, foreshadowing the Holocaust later in history. This film captures a culture, yet is a musical, too. An amazing achievement.",1005177600,,938,5.084415584415584

145874,5,0792838955,"To life!  ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is an increadable musical that is not to be missed.  It centers around Tevye, the poor but pleasant milkman (""We don't eat like kings, but we don't starve either,"") in Anatevka, a pre-Revolutionary Russian town of hardworking, faithful Orthodox Jews.  The community hears little of the outside world, so naturally he struggles with questions and problems as the world changes around him.  The film is a great family show that everyone will enjoy, a classic of classics that will continue to endure audiences for many a time to come.
The DVD is a great buy, too.  The most noteable bonus feature is wonderful feature-length audio commentary from the director Norman Jewison and the star, Topol (Tevye.)  They provide an intriuging and insightful comments and recall suprising memories about making the film.  For incidince, did you know that Topol was only 35 when ""Fiddler"" was shot?  Or that the whole film was shot with a piece of brownish-orange stocking taped to the lens of the camera?  Or that to make the horse limp the filmmakers put a pebel in his shoe?  All that trivia - plus lots more - is in the commentary.  Also cool is the 8-page booklet with more trivia.  And of course widescreen and scene selection are there, as standard with DVDs.
