3550754,1,B001EDGKWE,"I thought this was a DVD with urban legends. I didn't think it was high budget, but I thought it was at least fairly new. Instead, it is seven super cheesy 1970s videos with really horrible comedic voice overs. The videos aren't even gory - they are obviously fake and stupid.

When I first started the DVD, I thought maybe they had packaged the wrong thing in it. Nope. It is all stupid. Please, do not waste your money!",1232668800,2,421,4.329113924050633
8297890,5,B001EDGKWE,Just needed for our collection. Good movoe,1524614400,,42,5.142857142857143
8297891,5,B001EDGKWE,I think this is a fun & light hearted show that is a blast to watch with friends or even by yourself.  It's fun to figure out which is real or which is fake! It's also just a fun show to watch for something in between binge shows! I love it!,1513900800,,241,3.7254901960784315
8297892,2,B001EDGKWE,"I tried to give this show a fair chance. After a few episodes.. I am sure I do not like it. It gives you three interesting stories, and you know the whole time only one is true. It makes it kind of annoying, not entertaining.",1513382400,,225,4.022222222222222
8297893,5,B001EDGKWE,"I'm biased, because I just love urban legends in general. But they do a great job re-enacting and making it difficult to tell which is real and which is fake.",1512691200,,158,4.3
8297894,1,B001EDGKWE,"Watch Season 3 and see if you don't notice the pattern. After episode 1 or 2 it is ALWAYS 2 fake and 1 true and they always re-arrange the reveal to  go False, True, False. Unbelievably lazy",1512345600,,190,4.135135135135135
8297895,5,B001EDGKWE,I read all the reviews but when I saw Howard stern comparison I had to watch I adore him and it is like the mike walker game . Love it its FUN! Give it a try!!! Pick out the fake story Idk why the bad reviews??,1504828800,,210,3.5869565217391304
8297896,4,B001EDGKWE,"This is a twist on the spot the fake National Enquirer news story game from the Howard Stern Show (and replicated in other shows) The only real difference is the name which has been changed to one that's somewhat misleading... Urban legends are usually stories like the ""Chihuahua that was really a rat"" - most of these are modern news stories- by definition not legends. But, semantics aside, it's a fun show and a good way to be distracted for a half hour.",1493078400,,458,4.530120481927711
8297897,5,B001EDGKWE,Great,1479859200,,5,5.0
8297898,5,B001EDGKWE,"Each episode has several interesting stories reenacted & you have to try and guess which is actually an Urban Legend. You can't judge based on what is the bizarrest tale, as the saying goes, sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. Enjoyed this and would recommend to anyone that likes watching short stories.",1476144000,3,314,4.943396226415095
8297899,1,B001EDGKWE,"This makes no sense, looks like ideas that never got finished a bunch of footage edited into some sort of movie, Nobody gets credit in. Same filmmakers did do some good stuff like grossout or Blood diner.",1299542400,,204,4.54054054054054
