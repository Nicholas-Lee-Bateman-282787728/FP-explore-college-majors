8083041,1,B000B7QCO0,"THE RIDGE: A unknown person is stalking a weekend getaway.  The first 20 mins are horrible, cringworthy and boring-so much for writing.  After those sleep inducing 20 mins, we finally get some mayhem slashing.  The violence is actually tame but your mind makes you creep a little.  The young cast is blissfully slashed to death.  The acting is non-existentence.  Director BRETT HALEY who I'm a fan of is thankfully killed.  Most actors/directors get their start in horror film and Brett can now move forward.  Watched his movie THE HERO written for actor smoothie Sam Elliott.  It's a wonderful film to watch.  THE RIDGE is maybe 1.5 of 5 stars. Don't forget(it's horrible) to be brave for 20 mins....then watch.",1522195200,,712,4.907563025210084
8083042,4,B000B7QCO0,"Made in 2004 and released in 2005, The Ridge chronicles events when five college youths take a getaway to a luxurious vacation home on a scenic ridge and somehow incur the wrath of the legendary Ridge Runner, a psychopathic murderer.

This is a micro-budge film written and directed by Brett Haley, who also stars as the semi-pathetic Blake whos rejected by the woman he craves and disrespected by his brother (Neal Bledsoe) and another dude before going off to brood. Will his suppressed rage conjure up a beast from his Id who will give birth to the rash, murderous actions he could only daydream about with his conscious mind  la Forbidden Planet?

I was wondering if that was how the film would pan out, but Im not going to say.

Anyway, The Ridge begins with all the hallmarks of ultra-low budget fare, like poor sound, hand-held cams, less-than-stellar acting and dull dialogue/drama. The entire first half of the movie (43 minutes) is like this, which will tempt some viewers to tune out, but that would be a mistake because everything kicks into gear at the halfway point and Haleys talent is showcased from there out. Seriously, the change in quality is so great that The Ridge is almost like two movies. Drama obviously isn't Hayleys forte, but suspense/horror definitely is. The quality score by Austin Donohue accentuates the suspense.

Lydia Hyslop as Cara is a highlight; shes sweet & beautiful and (almost) worth the price of admission. Neal Bledsoe plays the main dude; he went on to greater things, from what I hear.

Someone compared The Ridge to the Friday the 13th movies and said that it was better than some of the sequels. While its true that its a taken from the Friday the 13th mold, it lacks the budget of any of those films and is therefore one-dimensional and amateurish (the first half, at least) by comparison. It also lacks the humor of some of the sequels of that franchise. Its totally serious, particular once the killer is revealed. Speaking of which, I like the fact that the Ridge Runner is presented as a mysterious killing machine with zero attempt to explain his (or her) insane actions, except for the legends spoken about him, but only in hushed tones late at night when the fires burn low.

The film runs 87 minutes and was shot on a ridge somewhere in the East, likely Pennsylvania or Skyline Drive, Virginia (I don't know; Im just guessing; theres no info about the shooting locations in the end credits or elsewhere).

GRADE: First half C- and second half A- for a balanced grade of B-",1470873600,,2531,4.697516930022573
8083043,1,B000B7QCO0,"Cabin in woods, cue spinner, and we get axe slasher. Noah (Neal Bledsoe) and his girlfriend Anna (Lauren Powell) go to his parent's secluded mountain home, one that is much nicer than anything I have owned or will own. He also takes a long his brother Blake (Brett Haley) an obnoxious, rejected, frustrated individual who is frequently called a DH. To pour salt in the wound his ex-gf Cara (Lydia Hyslop) comes along as well as a college jock friend (Jesse Patch) who wants to hook up with Cara.

The film opens with bad acting, bad dialogue and a lame soundtrack and doesn't get any better. There is a story about a Hunter who kills people on the Ridge and that is our killer introduction. Normally these types of films show a killing in the beginning to peak out interest and then relate it later on. This one did not. The killings took place in the dark and were not graphic, even with an axe.

The biggest horror was when 4 people were all screaming and talking at the same time. The film attempted to get sexy as Anna takes a dip in a striped bathing suit. She removes her bottoms, which are now flowered and tosses them at her boyfriend, then a moment later has on the original bottoms. Like Ed Wood would say, ""Who would notice?"" That is how bad the directing and editing was on the film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1404864000,2,1338,4.4089068825910935
8083044,1,B000B7QCO0,"This movie was boring and VERY slow moving, the plot was terrible and the acting stunk.  It was of low budget homemade quality. The camera was shakey, the lighting was anything but good, and we went 45 minutes into the movie without one single kill.  It's the kind of movie where the voices are low, then the music and bass are REALLY loud.  I HATE THAT!!!  The gore factor was non existent and the scare wasn't there.  I'd say avoid this one at all cost!",1203724800,4,455,4.305882352941176
8083045,5,B000B7QCO0,"This movie  has fresh, almost naive, on-screen talent and amazing cinematography that helps build a crescendo of suspense without resorting to special effects or excessive gore-- echoing the classic  Hitchcock, and others of that era.  Very promising behind -the- camera  expertise puts the viewer in the house with the weekend visitors.  A great winter evening popcorn-munching thriller!",1132358400,7,388,5.7368421052631575
