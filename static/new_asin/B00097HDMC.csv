and yes, she only does each once. but its nice how you can see different steps according to styling. very nice indeed.",1336176000,2,311,4.271186440677966
2270498,5,B00097HDMC,"This is literally a catalog of travel steps that shows you accent and combination possibilities.  This is not a beginner instruction DVD.  Using this DVD may very well broaden your dance movement vocabulary.  If you are stuck in a rut with your travelling steps, this DVD is a must!  If one of the steps seems familiar to you, watch it anyway.  It is good to review and she may add a layer that you may not have tried yet!  I really enjoyed this!  Autumn is always a treat to watch.  If you are wanting to venture into theatrical belly dance, Autumns DVDs are a must!",1322352000,,567,4.333333333333333
2270499,4,B00097HDMC,"as an advanced dancer, I really like the movement catalog and easy to follow along practice format. Lots of unique ideas for decorative foot & legwork that beautifully accents traditional bellydance technique.",1320278400,7,209,5.5625
2270500,2,B00097HDMC,"I'm an intermediate dancer and I did not like this.  It was boring to sit through and watch.  No following along here because there is no instruction.  It states ""open level"" whatever that is suppose to mean.  She only does each ""set"" a couple of times. By the time you read what she is doing she is almost done with the set and on to the next.

At the time I was watching the DVD I felt this would be good for advanced dancers.  Then I changed my mind because advanced dancers would know all this stuff already!!!!

I downloaded the companion PDF file from her website and found that it did not help me at all either.  It's probably great for her actual students.

The production of the DVD was great.  No garish reds bleeding.

This could have been a great DVD.  After all Autumn Ward is a great dancer and I have a different instructional by her and I like it.  Why do these companies think DVD's can only be an hour long?!  There should have been instructional added to this to make it a wonderful video that really was ""open"" to all types of dancers.",1320278400,16,1055,4.262626262626263
2270501,5,B00097HDMC,"""Belly Dance Travel Steps with Autumn Ward"" is the second volume of the movement catalogue series by World Dance New York. This open level reference material is for the serious dancer, novice, teacher, or anyone who wishes to enrich their dance vocabulary. These reference tools are presented by exceptional teachers such as Neon, and Autumn Ward. Here,the abundant resources in footwork patterns, and variations in combinations are accessible at your fingertips. Having used programs from WDNY for several years, I value their tremendous resources which have enriched my many varied dance styles.
 This series covers ""travel steps with layers, accents and step combinations."" From walking steps used to enter a stage, to forming combinations,the dictionary format will facilitate the query. This is not instruction or performance entertainment. Autumn Ward's impeccable teaching method is evident in her precise attention to the details and once you download the companion study guide it will become more evident.

 Working with the program was enjoyable,it moves rather quickly., Wanting to absorb it all, I used the repeat options as I progress along to material new to me.  The root menu makes the movement selection easy to navigate on a ""click"" and include:

 Layers and Timing Variations for Steps and Step-Hold: examples such as arabesque variations, step ball changes. Autumn demonstrates the movement several times continuously with the cues on screen.

Combinations with style variations lists: Saidi, American Cabaret, veil, contemporary fusion and lyrical Egyptian Folklore and Modern Egyptian Oriental.  In this section, Autumn teaches/demonstrates the difference in footwork styles and variations. I especially enjoyed the folkloric steps and marking steps to Saidi time. The veil section is beautifully done with impressive footwork, a lovely box step as well.

The Building blocks:
Study guide: a downloadable companion resource for dancers, teachers which intrically details and breakdown of the movement catalogue.

Foundations terminology and concepts: i.e.; step terminology, defining rotations, turning technique; etc. Comprehending terminology increases the awareness to recognize and apply proper movement.
Foundations movements and positions:  an extensive section that includes pivots, hip work driven touches and extensions, upper body layering.

 The dance resource is vast in this catalog; therefore the sections are done quickly without breakdown. From upper body accents,footwork,layering, the experienced dancer will soon acquire new information; the beginner has the option to study at length by using the ""repeat chapter selection."" Regardless of all my dance experience, and years of teaching,this catalog is valuable, collectible, information with convenient accessibility to refer to as often as I wish.",1317945600,2,2840,5.814457831325301

About Autumn, Credit and also from World Dance New York

 The welcome section is the exact piece that WDNY has put out as their advertising demo. It is an overview of what is on the dvd.

In the  catalog of dance steps portion she is just  demonstrating the movement there is no breakdown, no voice over saying anything about the movement. The actual name of the movement she is demonstrating is shown at the bottom of the screen. Autumn does each demonstration forward and backward.
  Layers and timing variations for step and step hold: For steps- Steps in every succession, Ball Change, Step-Ball-Change. For Step-Hold, Touch under the body or front, Knee lift and knee lift-extended, Extend front, Touch or extend side, Arabesque, Extend back(Parallel) and knee bend, swing through
Combinations with style variations: Modern Egyptian, Egyptian folklore(theatricized style), Saidi (Theatricized womens style) American Cabaret, Veil, Contemporary lyrical, Contemporary fusion.

The building blocks section is where she begins teaching some of the terms and concepts that go with the movement catalog section. In the foundation movements-she does not break down any movement , she again demonstrates movements.
The study guide is a written section that tells about the study guide and where it can be found.
  Foundation terminology;Lifting the foot  from the floor, Hip-ankle and foot articulation, steps-holds and layers, step-hold sequence, step terminology, ball chance and step-ball change, other step patterns, bellydance turn technique. Defining rotation: Inside and outside, open and close,.Breakdown for turns.
Foundations movements and positions: Heel lift or drop and hop, pivot, touch or lift under the body, push-pull-touch extend front-extend side-extend back, hipwork driven by touches and extensions, leg sweeps, other leg circles and swings, rotating around extensions, unweighted hipwork layers for holds, upperbody layers for holds, cross pivot, push-pivot, and traveling turns.

  There is no performance at the end. Basically, this is just what it says it is a catalog of traveling movements. I think this DVD would be perfect to look through for different traveling movements or step combinations. It's hard to rate whether her teaching style was effective in this DVD because there was practically nothing taught. Everything besides the concepts was quick demonstrations. She did break down the concepts and terminology rather well but briefly.

The total running time is 65minutes. And the whole dvd is pretty much demonstrations. I don't really know what to make of this dvd. I like the concept and I loved the movements but I'm not sure how useful it will be to dancers who do not already have the dance vocabulary available to use them. Granted the majority of the movements were not overly difficult.  If you are a beginner and cannot pick up dance movements from watching others dance, this dvd may not be for you. When the DVD stated that it is not dance instruction-they were telling the truth. There is no movement breakdown whatsoever on this DVD. This DVD really is for those who just need a collection of these steps to look through for planning a choreography or maybe a practice session. For intermediate to advanced Some of these movement could be taken and put into practice session to help ingrain them more in muscle memory. Even though I would say that I am not a particular fan of this DVD, I won't say that I disliked it either. I will have to give it 5 stars . This dvd does exactly what is says it does. It gives a catalog of movements with no instruction. So if you were looking to get a bit of Autumns dance technique breakdown  through this dvd, look elsewhere it is not here. Is this dvd worth it? If you want a dvd for the reasons stated above then yes. But had I paid ""attention"" to what was being offered I would have skipped this dvd altogether. Her online study guide mimics the dvd. She goes over the contents of the dvd in much the same format .",1317772800,20,4248,5.054363376251788

She continuously shows you step after beautiful step while music plays in the background. There isn't much talking, which I liked cause I didn't drift off and loose interest. I will be useing this for tons of choreography ideas!

The seller shipped this item quickly, and in a bubble package. It arrived fast and safe. :-)",1392336000,,427,4.77027027027027
8058277,5,B00097HDMC,"I got into belly dance via dance as exercise; I'm not one of those women who has taken dance classes since she was four. I find this DVD to be a perfect resource for anyone without a dance background. Ward breaks down terminology and steps into the smallest possible parts, so no matter your dance experience or background, you can follow along. It's also a good resource for those who have a non-belly dance background, and can't figure out why their belly dance moves don't look quite right (you know who you are!!), as Ward breaks down how to do moves, and talks about what makes belly dance unique.

That said, the best thing about this DVD is that it presents, as the title states, travel steps (and all sorts of fun variations on them). Whether you're into choreo or improv, being able to travel onstage is key. Ward does a fabulous job of starting with a basic step -- say, step-touch -- and then builds on the basic step, adding all kinds of variations. I also like that Ward categorizes by dance type (there's a section on folkloric dance, for instance) so you can match your traveling steps to your music.

As always, Ward is lovely, and everything about the DVD (videotaping, music, etc.) is enjoyable. A must-purchase!",1378944000,,1230,4.6118721461187215

8058279,5,B00097HDMC,"I don't often write review, unless the product make me rave about it every time when I use it, or it is defective/over-priced. This is one of those that I can't strop raving about it.

I learned dance from a teacher for four years and the last two years have been learning on my own. The more I go, the more I found that travelling and transition steps are what make the biggest difference for interpreting the music and for dancing on the stage. This video is rich in authentic dance moves that you can easily improvise and make your own dance. Autumn's moves are rich in flavor and playfullness and thus very fun to watch.

Perhaps this is not for the very beginner but the earlier one start to learn from it the better one can build these moves in her system.

I would love to buy another instruction video from Autumn with a similar style and structure.",1367625600,3,857,4.377358490566038
8058280,5,B00097HDMC,"Many belly dancers have so many hip and hand movements in their repertoire but lack travel steps.  This DVD is the answer.  Be warned though, it assumes you have some prior knowledge of belly dance moves.  It really is a catalog.  There are tons and tons and tons of moves in this DVD and you will be hitting the replay button a LOT.  I think this DVD would be useful to every belly dancer regardless of what type of belly dance you do.  I loved this DVD!  Wish I'd had it 10 years ago.",1356825600,5,486,4.1063829787234045
8058281,3,B00097HDMC,Lots of steps but with limited instruction on how to execute them and she rushes through too fast with little repetition.,1355270400,2,121,4.809523809523809
8058282,5,B00097HDMC,"Good production value, well laid out menu options, and quite a lot of content make this DVD a nice addition to a video reference library. Autumn Ward is a lovely dancer who presents the movement well. I especially liked her use of ballet terminology, and balletic explanations for certain movements. This makes it easy for the classically trained, western dancer to understand. Movements characteristic of several different belly dance styles are given, each in their own section. There is also a section that discusses the absolute basics of movement which gives a clear explanation for newer dancers, and is a nice refresher for more advanced dancers. Miss Ward is able to put into words the concepts that most of us just know by feel. Movements and combinations are presented rather fast, and so may be a bit intimidating to less experienced dancers. The pause and reverse functions of the DVD player will come in handy. There is also an accompanying study aid pdf, available on line, that helps fill in any blanks, and also offers lesson plans useful in guiding ones own practice. I would recommend this DVD for seasoned dancers, and perhaps even those with at least some dance background, but not necessarily for the complete novice. This video is excellent brain food for dancers who are at a level where they do their own choreography, and/or are teaching others.",1350086400,4,1370,4.935064935064935
