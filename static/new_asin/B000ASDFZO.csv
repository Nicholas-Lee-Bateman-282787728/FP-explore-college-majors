8324389,4,B000ASDFZO,"This is a truly magical English movie.  It is the story of a boy who has recently lost his mother.  Whilst out exploring he has a bag containing millions land on his playhouse; this story is his journey to make the world a better place by distributing the money to those less fortunate while his brother is trying to use the money to make his own world better.  It is funny and sad, has lovely fantasy scenes where Saints pop in for a chat and help the boy along his journey.  I highly recommend this family movie.",1144195200,,514,4.268041237113402
