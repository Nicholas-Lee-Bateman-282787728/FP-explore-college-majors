3174198,5,B0017MO0U6,"Product:  ZATOICHI: The Blind Swordsman (Television Series), Collections One & Two (Season 1, 1974)
DVD Supplier/Format: ""Tokyo Shock"" DVD (6+6=12 discs total), 1:33 Full Screen, NTSC, Japanese with English subtitles
Rating:  5/5 (excellent) for the TV Series, but only 3/5 (fair) for this DVD collection.

Note: Scroll down for a full list of the episodes included in this collection.

I'm a die-hard Ichi-fan, and it was a brief run-in with several episodes that prompted me to study Iaiado back in the late 1980's.  It is widely reputed that the American ""Kung Fu"" TV series (1972-1975), starring the late David Carradine was directly inspired by this series, and the hit Graphic Novel ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" was a nearly direct adaptation.

The basic premise is this: blind lower-caste loveable Japanese ""peasant hero"", wanders the countryside, from village to village, helping the downtrodden, during the Edo period of Feudal Japan.  He poses as a masseuse, with a huge appetite for food and sake, but it's his superhuman skills with his hidden cane-sword, and his gambling dice, that make him an irresistible force to be reckoned with, and the bane of local yakuza.  Every week featured a new orphan, couple, family, or village in trouble, and Ichi's passage though town is always the catalyst for a dramatic resolution to the conflict du jour.  It's a feel-good formula that's been used again and again, in endless permutations, in TV and comic book series the world over, be they sighted or blind ... The Gunfighter, Robin Hood, Zorro, Daredevil, etc.  It's rightfully considered a cult classic, and spanned 26 theatrical movies, and a hit TV series that ran for 4 seasons (approximately 100 episodes).

That brings us, at last, to this DVD collection, which unfortunately, was not labeled and assembled very well:

The Good:
* Collections One and Two together include the complete first season (1974) of ""Tales of Zatoichi"" (TV Series).  Twenty six episodes of pure Zatoichi goodness.  Love it !

The Bad:
* Confusing Amazon product description that fails to list much of anything about the series, or the episodes included in this collection.
* DVD Jackets that fails to list the episodes included.
* DVD labels that are confusingly marked by collection, volume and disc number, rather than by season and episode numbers.
* Top Menus that fail to list the episodes included on each disc ... you have to navigate down to, and through, the individual scene selection menus in order to find the episode numbers present, and even then they're not always present, and don't include the English episode titles.
* Clumsy DVD cases with a fragile inner hinge, and holders that grasp the discs much too firmly (you have to nearly bend the discs in half to detach them).
* The digital transfers were apparently made from an un-restored copy of the original series ... the quality is somewhat below average.

Bottom Line:  Zatoichi is an awesome series.  It's a shame this particular collection (by ""Tokyo Shock"") was released with such mediocre packaging and confusing labels and digital menus ... but despite that, it's still highly recommended, if only because it's Zatoichi.

3174199,5,B0017MO0U6,"You'll save money purchasing this set vs. buying the DVDs individually.  If you're a fan of samurai films, Lone Wolf & Cub, or the Zatoichi films then you'll love Zatoichi the TV series.  The production isn't quite as good as the films, but it's good enough.  The incredible stories and sword fighting is what will keep you glued to your seat.  The original actor from the films reprises his role here and is excellent.

I highly recommend this set, as well as set one.  And if you haven't seen the films, definitely go check those out as well.  Zatoichi is a masterpiece in storytelling.",1230422400,14,588,4.596153846153846
3174200,5,B0017MO0U6,"As stated in the title, Zatoichi Collection II contains Episodes 14-26 of the First Season.

Whether you are a die-hard Zatoichi fan, or a casual viewer looking for something different, the Zatoichi Collections are great place to begin (Or end, if you've already seen all 26 of Katsushin's movies. If you haven't, well...what are you waiting for?!?)

Each of the 13 episodes (14-26) averages *about* 50 minutes. If you find yourself questioning ""how many scumbags can our hero possibly dispatch in only 50 minutes?"", well, the answer is ""as many as he wants"".

Each episode is a mini-movie, with all the action, humor, drama and tragedy of a full-length movie packed into 50 minutes. I've seen all 26 episodes of the 1st Season, and I enjoyed every single minute of my time spent with Shintaro Katsu as the immortal-beloved, Zatoichi.

Fans of Zatoichi will notice repeat plot-lines, gags, and similar stunts during certain action sequences, but don't even think of letting that dissuade you from purchasing these treasures. The true beauty of Zatoichi is that it's star, the very soul of the show, Shintaro Katsu, could make a humorless joke funny, or a cliche' pratfall look new, interesting, and even dangerous. He could make eating a steaming bowl of rice look so delicious, that I just had to stop and cook myself some right then and there, while Ichi-san waited on pause in the living-room.

Now, writing a review of each episode is a lot of work, and I'm far too lazy to even consider doing that, so just take my word when I say that even a *not so good* episode of Zatoichi, is still twice as good as almost anything out there. In my book, there are a few *not so good* episodes, while the rest (and there are 100 episodes in all) fall into the *Oh my god, that was awesome!* category.

In closing, I'll just say if you don't already own Zatoichi Collection I, go buy it right now. If you already own it and are reading this review of Collection II, you can stop reading now and go buy it; I won't be offended you didn't finish reading this, I promise.",1226448000,28,2060,4.614754098360656

8266614,5,B0017MO0U6,"Having collected the 26 Blind Swordsman feature films, I was curious to see what the television series would be like. I must say that I was not disappointed. One of the things I did notice was that a few of the plots were very similar as the films, which was not a bad thing.
How Shintaro Katsu made the stories more interesting was by putting the Blind Swordsman in the position, as though he was a secondary character in the story, thereby giving the guest performers the majority of the story telling. Of course, no matter what problems befall the guest characters, Zatoichi uses his humor & ""flashing sword"" to remedy the situations.
Collection #2 contains 13 - 50 minute episodes from series #1, on 6 disks. The video quality is good. The audio is Japanese with English sub-titles.  I am very happy with my purchase. So if you like the films, you won't be disappointed with series.",1473465600,3,886,4.6075949367088604
