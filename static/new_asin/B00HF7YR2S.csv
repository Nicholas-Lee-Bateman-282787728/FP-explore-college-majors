You will love it to from the opening song  ..the hauntingly epic Angel..to the beautiful Glosoli..the sang perfect in Japanese  Kaze No  Torimichi (my personal soft kitty song for all you Big Bang Theory fans!) Get this dvd and be transported to a higher..happier place..Kenny Taylor",1394236800,4,407,4.690140845070423
6160889,5,B00HF7YR2S,"This concert is so beautiful!!  It is just as beautiful as Sarah's
live concert was---I had the great privilege to get to experience
here in Texas last October!!  The songs are just lovely and her
costumes are amazing!!  Her voice is crystal clear as always and
delivers the sounds as only our Angel of Music can!  Loved the
concert and only wish it had been longer---just can't seem to
get enough of Miss Sarah Brightman---absolutely love her sweet
spirit and her heavenly voice!!  Thank you Sarah Brightman for
sharing your beautiful voice with us again!!",1394236800,2,557,4.821052631578947
6160890,5,B00HF7YR2S,"Besides too short, her performance is always remarkable. This particular production counts on visual effects in high quality and excelent sound skills. I wish I could see it release sooner with all of the missing tracks definitelly included!!!",1392768000,3,243,5.421052631578948
6160891,5,B00HF7YR2S,"I saw this concert live and it was incredible. The whole concert is not on the DVD though, basically just the new material because the songs that were omitted from the DVD are already on her previous DVD's. Currently you can order the DVD on the PBS website and make a donation. That is how I obtained my copy. If you are able to see this concert live, please do. It amazes me how Sarah continually improves with each tour.",1392595200,3,423,4.3
6160892,5,B00HF7YR2S,"I own all of Sarah Brightman's concerts on DVD and I watch them often. Currently, this particular DVD is not released in the U.S. so this DVD is a little more expensive but she puts on a terrific show - takes you away from reality for a little while. I noticed the format for this concert is a little different from the other ones. She sings songs from her Dreamchaser album while standing in front of a curved screen and there's a light show happening on that screen. Her voice is magnificent, the songs are beautiful. This is a very short concert - under 1 hour and the 2 additional songs on the Bonus Features Section of the DVD should have been incorporated into the main concert.  I think there were some parts of the concert that was omitted from the DVD which should not have been omitted. Also, I think the order of the songs that were performed were changed around on the DVD.  Also, they do not show the orchestra, on the other DVDs I enjoy watching the members of the orchestra playing their instruments. I personally like Frank Peterson's (he produced all the other Sarah Brightman concerts) format better than these new people.  Overall, I enjoyed this DVD.",1391990400,13,1170,4.535545023696683
6160893,5,B00HF7YR2S,"Long time Sarah fan here, so of course I was excited to order this. I own every Sarah concert and music DVD's, and now this one to my great collection. I was able to get this cheaper on ebay brand new as the going rate on Amazon is $40 or more, only because this DVD is only produced for the asia market. Dealers on ebay are also selling this $40 or more but there is one dealer there selling it $17.99 with free shipping from Malaysia. I didn't mind the lengthy shipping time to get a great deal. The DVD is NTSC format with an ALL region coding. I only have one minor complaint about this DVD and it's the heavy editing. It's no big deal but I do enjoy watching Sarah interact with the audience between songs. It felt as though the production was rushed when watching Sarah go straight to the next song right after finishing one. Other than that everything else is great! It's great to hear and watch Sarah perform the new songs from ""Dreamchaser"", with a few classics added in there. The concert is in picture clear widescreen with excellent DTS surround sound. 12 songs are performed with 2 bonus performances, behind the scenes, and a gallery. A great addition to any Sarah fan's collection!",1390780800,18,1196,4.4409090909090905

6160896,5,B00HF7YR2S,"The essence of this concert is the celebration of Sarah Brightman going into space!! She has been accepted into the ISS program and paid dearly for the right to do so.  Most celebrities do not qualify for the program, despite the cost because of their physical limitations, their lack of intellectual propensities, or inability to endure psychological stresses. Sarah made it!!!  Closer, which is my very favorite, with music written by Oldfield, had it's lyrics written by Sarah herself. If you want to get a glimpse into her interior being, listen closely to her words. Other familiar classics like ""Song of India"" captures a most transcendent mood, as well as other selections during her performance This concert is personal to her and was not created for commercial purposes. So we know that she not only has magic in her divine voice, she has magic in her heart. This concert is ONLY for her most devoted of fans, of which I am one.",1443398400,,937,4.777777777777778
6160897,3,B00HF7YR2S,"Being an avid Sarah Brightman fan for 25 years, I was a little disappointed in the Dreamchaser DVD. Her voice was good, but not outstanding. She didn't seem to be energized. Compared to her past tours, DVDs; This one was almost dull. No choreography and little staging. And this DVD was pricey. I'll always be a Sarah Brightman fan, despite my opinion of this CD. She is an exquisite soprano and performer as well as an astute business woman.",1440288000,,442,4.6075949367088604

6160900,3,B00HF7YR2S,"I agree with all the positive comments shared by other members. Now a bit on the negative side (this is reference to the Blu-ray):

1. This BD cost over $50 (luckily I got it at $32 only) & frankly I'm quite disappointed with the video production. I agree with the others who had mentioned: It's very rush i.e.one song after another, no interaction with the audience, etc. I expect to enjoy this BD as if I were experiencing in a actual concert, not viewing a collection of songs which I can do that in my CDs. The last song hasn't ended yet but the end credits already started rolling...In reality, I don't think that was the last song. If I guess correctly, the last song of the concert was Time to Say Good-bye but it was edited out & put into the Extra/Bonus section together with Scarborough Fair. This is weird.

2. Video quality is good. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the audio quality considering it's in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. It leaves much to be desired! The audio track was poorly done. Sarah's voice is very muddy & at times I hardly can make out what was she singing. The audio is also lack punch & dynamic despite I cranked up my receiver in my dedicated home theater. Oh the ""clapping hands"" surround was done pretty good!

Having said the above, being Sarah Brightman's fan I still enjoy her songs & concert. Hopefully the next SB Blu-ray deserve better treatment.",1430438400,7,1393,4.4980237154150196

She's amazing no matter if your listening to a CD, or DVD, she's always right there but in person it's always a unique experience and that voice leaves you wanting more and more. The staging is simple yet your in awe during to what your seeing and hearing. I give this concert 5 stars, you will be amazed, especially the opening number Angel.",1408147200,,412,4.506666666666667

6160919,5,B00HF7YR2S,"Although a bit expensive, this Blu-ray Disc from Sarah Brightman is simply breathtaking!

I thought long and hard before deciding to purchase this concert, for a number of reasons:

1) While I am a die-hard SB fan, I was somewhat disappointed with her latest album ""Dreamchaser"". I felt that it didn't lack the musical or lyrical punch that were present in most of her previously released Frank Peterson-produced works.

2) I believe it's time for Sarah to switch it up a bit. Although I appreciate her style, I think it's beginning to wear a little thin. I would love to see her do something somewhat different or more edgy, if for no other reason, than to surprise us. After all, she's an outstanding performer and exceptionally talented singer.

3) And finally, this is just an expensive disc. Especially, for only an hour or so of content.

Having made those points, I couldn't have been more wrong regarding this release. The show is a visual triumph, as the songs come to life like never before. The amazing screens and lighting created a stimulating experience that left me with a whole new appreciation for the album. Now I get it! Since then, I've found myself returning to the CD again and again, as I continue to rediscover songs that I previously passed over the first time.

And finally, I know a lot of people found the concert to be too short. But after watching it, I actually think the running time is perfect. It left me satisfied, yet still wanting more... which is exactly what any good performance should do.

Highly recommended!",1406332800,8,1550,4.718518518518518

6160922,2,B00HF7YR2S,"The set and especially the led wall was wonderful. Sarah Brightman sung beautifully but her presence on the stage left wanting. This was not A full concert but a collection of songs. Very good songs were left out from the main feature and were available as bonus tracks for no obvious reason.

All in all the Dreamchaser Blu-ray was a disapointment. Despite the seemingly high production values it's not worth buying unless you are a die hard fan.",1401580800,17,447,4.730769230769231
6160923,4,B00HF7YR2S,"Production was maintained, the quality in each of the interpretations moved to the concert (I feel the same excitement when I was in the City of Mexico), the downside is that you only get song after song, no interaction with the public (something you have in all other recordings of the concerts), another good point from Symphony in Vienna, we did not have a tour video.

The only detail in the performance of Deliver Me, this is presented in the last part of the song, so do not appreciate this performance.",1394755200,,509,4.593406593406593

8632209,3,B00HF7YR2S,"Very disappointed in the quality of this video. When I buy BD I expect Blu-Ray quality, but it was not, it was merely standard DVD quality. In addition, some of the songs were shortened, and the main one I wanted at the end was merely a reprise. I am packing it for return.",1500940800,,273,4.169811320754717

8632211,2,B00HF7YR2S,"This is obviously an attempt to make a professional looking bootleg, and I would wager anything that this release has NOTHING to do with Ms. Brightman and the company that normally releases her concerts on DVD and Blu-Ray (usually Angel Records and/or Nemo Studious and/or Ms. Brightman and Frank Peterson themselves, who have been responsible for excellent quality DVDs and hopefully with ""Dreamchaser,"" Blu-ray discs as well), and they give their fans who buy them their money's worth.  This is a copy of the PBS special that someone is making money off of, but sadly, I don't believe it is Ms. Brightman and her company, and Amazon should not even be selling this.

I am STILL waiting for Ms. Brightman and Mr. Peterson to release a legal, professional product of this excellent concert that PBS only gave their fans about an hour of.  I am also certain that their release will satisfy their fans with its quality and professionalism, as has been the case with ALL of her concert releases (starting with ""Eden"" and even her video collections that SHE released), in the past, and that ""Dreamchaser"" will be the same excellent production/release that all of their true fans are still waiting for.

Just because it has her name and the concert's name on it doesn't mean you should settle for (and buy) an expensive imitation of what seems to be a superb concert (from the glimpses of the PBS songs she sang that are on this disc), and that she is also breaking new visual ground.  All of her concerts she has released until now have been professional and extremely mindful of giving her millions of fans their money's worth, and I'll gladly spend my money when that release comes out.  Please don't keep your fans waiting much longer with the professional and LEGAL release of your concert, Ms. Brightman.  I'll be sure to buy it on the day that it is released, as I'm sure all of your fans will as well.  Thanking you in advance.",1470355200,2,1930,4.689349112426036

8632215,2,B00HF7YR2S,"I have not seen the DVD, and I won't bother watching it. Why? I was at the recording at Elstree (very lucky to be front row centre).  She sang 22 songs on the night and the show and visuals were incredible. However this DVD has only 12 songs and 2 bonus tracks!  She performed 21 full tracks on the night; the whole show was recorded so why not give the fans the full release?
Incredibly disappointing.

Hijo De La Luna
La Luna
Eperdu
Beautiful Day

8632216,5,B00HF7YR2S,"Great!  Time marches on but Sarah's voice is still wonderful, praise heaven!  The special effects are dazzling in digital!  So is the digital stereo...German techno backup for a trip to the stars!  May have to play it a couple of times to fully appreciate the impact as it is subtle but then it hits you between the eyes and then you cannot stop playing it and then hearing the tunes in your head for days.

Answers the question of what to do when you have reached perfection?  How could she possibly top her last two DVDs?

The answer is you evolve...Sarah is still beautiful (a red head this time).  An alluring, sophisticated, amazing talent.  Plus she sings a beautiful song in Japanese for a very appreciative audience.

Her amazing rendition of ""Venus and Mars"" alone is worth the price of this DVD.",1460246400,2,805,4.605633802816901
