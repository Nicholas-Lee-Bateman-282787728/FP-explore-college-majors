3018768,5,B000YA4K2U,"I brought this DVD directly from Kathleen Kastner after taking her yoga class in Los Angeles, which was great by the way. I wanted a DVD that I could use at home when I couldn't make it to a yoga class. This is perfect, it's an hour long  compared to the usual yoga class which 1 1/2hrs long and so frees up more time for other things. There is detailed instruction on all the poses in the DVD to get you started.  Kathleen is very informative about how to do the poses properly and to your level. I am not a teen but an adult, but I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to start a yoga practice to build strength and flexibilty. I have noticed a great improvement in my own strength and flexibility after doing this class for only a few weeks. It does seem a little challenging at first but I think thats good, as thats the only way we get stronger. I have especially noticed that my abs and arms feel stronger from the postures which I really need. This DVD works the whole body and develops a great sense of self confidence and inner calm which is wonderful at any age, but especially for teens. I am sending this DVD to my nieces and nephews to use.",1226361600,7,1161,4.178571428571429
3018769,5,B000YA4K2U,I really liked this DVD and any teen interested in yoga couldn't have a better one on one training session.

I was hoping the view a video about teens practicing yoga.  This is not the case. I felt the practice was too difficult, and unrealistic for most teens.",1225929600,7,287,7.696969696969697
3018771,5,B000YA4K2U,"Kathleen Kastner, noted yoga-master for celebrities and VIPs, leads Allie LaForce and the audience through an easy to follow (but occassionally challenging), yoga routine.  Her selection of poses and the flow of her workout is stimulating and invigorating, while still being accessible to beginners and more advanced yoga practioners.  Of special note to the program is the impressive ""Lifestyles"" section, which presents valuable tips on activities and diet that can easily be incorporated into one's daily routine.  I highly recommend this DVD for all audiences, as well as an excellent gift for parents or grandparents to give to teens as a step towards a healthier, happy lifestyle for loved ones.",1195516800,21,701,5.3545454545454545

8231523,5,B000YA4K2U,This is a great workout. Great instructions - as it provides variations on the poses for those unable to do the full pose.  Learned a lot.,1400889600,,138,4.3076923076923075

8231526,5,B000YA4K2U,"I just love it! My 14years old daughter likes the music. You can watch this with or without the music. Instruction is clear and very easy to follow. This is filmed in a very sunny studio as you can see on the front cover. I really like this ""in the studio"" feeling. My dughter said this is the best yoga DVD so far and I agree with her. I do yoga with this dvd almost everyday now. My doughter actually got some muscle in her arms and she is very happy. Simple and pleasant power yoga dvd. Very happy with this purchase.",1319241600,3,520,4.107843137254902
8231527,5,B000YA4K2U,"The reason I ordered this DVD is because I saw Kathleen Kastner teaching Molly Sims yoga on a podcast. I noticed what a wonderful teacher she was. I could tell Kathleen loves people and yoga and I had to have her DVD! A wonderful intructional DVD for both beginners and intermediates. The program is made up of Kathleen teaching breathing exercises, instruction for 16 key poses, a 55-minute power yoga class, a section on diet and fitness. I love this DVD and love that Kathleen shared her love of yoga with us! Kathleen, could you do more yoga DVDs?!",1227225600,6,552,4.585858585858586

8231529,5,B000YA4K2U,"This video is upbeat, professional, and super fun.  Kathleen is very informative about what is needed to start a practice as a teen.  She is well-experienced and precise, which is just what teens need to get them into yoga.  Enjoy every minute!",1226620800,2,244,4.761904761904762
8231530,5,B000YA4K2U,"I love this DVD, I've been able to take Kathleen's class and the DVD makes me feel like I'm in her class. If you've done yoga DVD;s before you probably know the usual sun salutations. It's like all DVD's are the same. NOT THIS ONE. It's a vinyasa flow with ashtanga yoga poses. It's easy enough for beginners but hard enough to keep you working up to an advanced level if you want to go there. Very well rounded...and FUN!",1226448000,11,422,4.2875
