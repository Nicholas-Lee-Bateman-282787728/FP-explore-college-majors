7825178,5,6302390397,TY HARDIN IS A GREAT ACTOR. HIS SHOWS SHOW  HOW THE  LAW IS ENFORCED  AND THE BAD OUTLAWS ARE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. I THINK CHILDREN WOULD WATCH AND LEARN FROM  HARDIN'S  SHOWS BECAUSE HE PLAYS A US MARSHALL IN THE SERIES. HE ALSO  GOES UNDERCOVER FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CATCH LAW BREAKERS AND PUT THEM IN JAIL.,1386201600,2,308,4.315789473684211
7825179,5,6302390397,This  is the only other  episode of the Bronco series  to be  released  by Warner Brothers on VHS. It is enjoyable  and the  picture  quality on the tape  is quite good.,1361404800,2,169,4.193548387096774
7825180,4,6302390397,"Often fond childhood memories of TV series are spoilt by watching the TV re-runs. However this is not the case with this video of Warner Bros BRONCO.  In this episode of BRONCO, Ty Hardin is the two-fisted  ex-confederate Army Captain, now a ranch hand who befriends Billy the Kid.
This is family entertainment to be enjoyed by all.
Makes me long to  see all of the 68 episodes which were made, between September12, 1958 and  September 20, 1960.
Where is Ty Hardin (Orton Hungerford) today?",962496000,19,490,4.729411764705882
7825181,4,6302390397,"Another action-packed Bronco episode, in which the Confederate Captain Bronco Layne, tangles with Billy The Kid. Now settled and happily married, Billy has tried to put his past behind him. However, Pat Garrett, played by  Rhodes Reason, of ""White Hunter"" fame is determined to bring him  to book for his past crimes. Like many of these classic Warner Bros  westerns, the appearance of veteran B-western stars is a feature, and Allan  ""Rocky"" Lane plays a Sherriff in this one. A fair amount of  violence and menacing behaviour in this series in general, if you have  young children. Print is pristine black and white and sound is crisp Dolby  B.",961977600,9,646,4.871559633027523
