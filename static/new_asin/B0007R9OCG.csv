8050893,3,B0007R9OCG,"This 25 minute video has good production quality.  There is good information for a new pool owner, but little about spas.  This video does not talk about vinyl liner pools, which is what I have.  Nor does it talk about above ground pools, which I don't have.  There was no talk of algae problems, how to test the water chemistry, seasonal opening and closing of pools.  All in all, I doubt I will watch it again.  I will probably donate it to my local library.",1250553600,,460,4.352941176470588
8050894,4,B0007R9OCG,"I am a swimming pool professional in both service, repair & construction.  We purchased this video to give to our new pool customers.  Most of it is very good and easy to understand. They suggest acid washing a pool after a few years.  My experience would suggest this is a bad idea, as it shortens the life of the pool plaster.",1180137600,5,328,4.344262295081967
8050895,4,B0007R9OCG,"This video is pretty much a beginner video which explains basic concepts and operation of a pool and spa.  It goes through the thought process and show you what everything is and how to use it.  If you were hoping for a video that goes a little deeper such as, how to winterize the pool, this isn't the video.  The default answer to anything more than back flushing the filter is ""Call a professional"".  Overall, a good beginner overview.",1159660800,6,438,4.506329113924051
8050896,5,B0007R9OCG,"I purchased my first home with a pool and a spa a little less than two years ago. The previous owner gave me a quick lesson on pool care. This scared me to death. I promptly went out and got a pool service and another and another. After purchasing this video, I realized that it isn't as difficult as I thought it was to take care of your pool. This was immensely informative in all areas. The best area for me personally was on the equipment and on how everything fits together. I always felt stupid when asking questions to my pool service. Now I can ask halfway intelligent questions and my service seems to be getting better.  I am even tempted to do the service myself. This video not only provides information for the novice like myself, but for the more experienced pool owners as well. I highly recommend this video.",990316800,27,824,4.421052631578948
