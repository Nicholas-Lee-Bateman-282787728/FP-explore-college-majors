8031177,4,B0002S64PA,This take from the book followed Catherine Gaskin's novel closely and was very well done at the time. I'd like to see A&E or PBS do a new version.,1393804800,,146,4.068965517241379
8031178,3,B0002S64PA,"First screened to Australian TV audiences in 1982 ""Sara Dane"" is the third miniseries that I'm aware of with a storyline set in Australia's convict past. The others being ""For the Term of his Natural Life"" and  ""Against The Wind"" This one (from the producers of Breaker Morant and Storm Boy) is watchable but not to the level of the other two. The story tells of a young and ambitious convict girl who marries one of  her transportation ships officers and fights to become accepted into the colony's social circles. Now on I believe all region DVD with a run time of 435 minutes.",1190332800,,579,4.5576923076923075
