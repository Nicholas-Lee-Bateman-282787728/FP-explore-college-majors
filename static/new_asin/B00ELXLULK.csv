8606759,3,B00ELXLULK,"The most irritating aspect is the male protagonist's eye-rolling overacting when faced with any hazardous or distressing situation. The plot doesn't help either, as it has him ineffective in countering some fairly simple plots hatched by his opponents. A capable physician, but a feeble personality.
The other characters are more credible, and it is interesting to re-encounter some of the figures from Jewel in the Palace (Jang Geum) in a different context - although one is rather taken aback by seeing 16th century Korean physicians dressed like 19th century Western nurses.
Had a better actor been chosen for the lead role, this would have been worth four stars.",1402531200,,666,5.175925925925926
8606760,5,B00ELXLULK,"This KDrama series is one of my very favorites. Love the plot and the so talented actors/actresses - especially Song Jong- Ho as the inspector Lee Jung Hwan and Lee Dong Wook as doctor Choi Won as well as Song Ji Hyo as nurse Hong Da In.

This series is sooo good. It is on the same level than ""The Princess' Men"" , ""The Moon that embraces the Sun"" , ""Tree with deep Roots"", ""Arang  and the Magistrate"" and ""Iljimmae"".

Loved it !!!!",1390348800,3,433,4.192771084337349
