Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie is a brand-new 22-minute cartoon and the sixth direct-to-DVD offering of its kind. But when you compare this latest effort with the filler added to flesh out the two-disc Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Surfs Up, Scooby-Doo!, you almost wish that Warner Bros. had substituted a few more older episodes instead. Beach Beastie is by far the weakest, a going-through-the-motions affair that relies too much on Freds paranoia over nets and Scoobys new love interest. It also offers too little in the way of mystery and phony monster momentsthe two driving forces behind the popular franchise. What we get this time is a water monster that weve seen too many times before in other films.

Though a few voiceover actors and the style of drawing and animation changed over the years, the formula remains mostly the same: the Mystery, Inc. gang (timid Great Dane Scooby-Doo, always hungry Shaggy, bookish Velma, stylish Daphne, and All-American guy Fred) rambled onto the scene where a monster or ghost was terrifying people. Sometimes they were hired to get to the bottom of things, while other times they helped out a friend or simply fell into a mystery while trying to take a vacationoften to some exotic location. And always the unmasking revealed a phony monster with someone inside or with a remote control manipulating it for revenge or personal gain.

I don't know if Warner Bros. deliberately chose filler episodes from a full range of Saturday-morning Scooby-Doo! cartoon shows, but to me that variety is the chief bonus. You really get a sense of the whole arc of this franchise. If only Warner Bros. had arranged the episodes in order, so viewers could better see how the characters and the series developed over 40 years. As is, the episodes are arranged either thematically (if you're a glass half-full person) or randomly (if half-empty).

Heres the breakdown of whats included, which Ive arranged chronologically according to the TV series on which the episodes first appeared:

Scooby-Doo! Where Are You!
A Clue for Scooby-Doo (1969)
Scoobys Night with a Frozen Fright (1970)
A Creepy Tangle in the Bermuda Triangle (1978)
The Creepy Case of Old Iron Face (1978)

Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo
Shiver and Shake, That Demons a Snake (1979)
Twenty Thousand Screams under the Sea (1979)

The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show
Hang in There Scooby (1980)
Scooby-Nocchio/Scoobys Roots/Lighthouse Keeper Scooby (1981)
Excaliber Scooby/Scoobys Luck of the Irish/Scoobys Escape from Atlantis (1981)

A Pup Named Scooby-Doo
Scooby Dude (1988)

Whats New Scooby-Doo?
She Sees Sea Monsters by the Seashore (2002)

Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!
Cruisin for a Bruisin (2007)

NewDirect to DVD
Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie (2015)

ScoobyDooSurfsUpscreenScooby and the Mystery, Inc. gang somehow appeal to all ages, no matter what generation you're from. In that respect its a true family cartoon series.

Scrappy-Doo appears in a few of these episodes, which will either annoy or delight viewers. Most of the episodes are in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, while some are 1.37:1 and others are 169 widescreen. The picture quality varies according to age, with the sharpest (Beach Beastie) pictured as a screen shot.

Only one episode actually involves surfing, but the cartoons included on this DVD all have something to do with the sea. Diehard fans will want to buy complete seasons only, but for families whose interest is more casual, Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Surfs Up, Scooby-Doo! offers a nice sampler of the Scooby-Doo! franchise over the decades.

I have enjoyed each of these new episodes released on these 13 Spooky Tales DVDs. And they have been a great venue for Warner Bros to test the waters on unreleased cartoons featuring Scrappy Doo. After all these decades I am so over my disdain for Scrappy. And it is really great to be able to see these again.

Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Clue has the best Scooby theme songs ever and is a fun different take on Scooby Doo. It is similar to The Venture Brothers, only not disturbing. It is great to get another episode of it.

So we get 1 New episode and 3 New to DVD episodes and one episode that became available the month before. Not bad for these 13 Spooky Tales releases.

UPDATE:

Just got this in the mail today.

The DVD opens with a trailer for Tom & Jerry Spy Quest and where the Tom & Jerry movies seem to be aimed at a younger audience than the Scooby Doo releases, I am beyond excited about the return of Johnny Quest and the character designs of the Quest characters is very interesting, seems a little inspired by John K. Seeing this trailer made my day.

Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie: I really like the design of the water monster, and love that Fred and nets is more or less a thematic holdover from Mystery Inc.

Scooby-Nocchio/Scooby's Roots/Lighthouse Keeper Scooby: Starts off with a quick take on Pinocchio, then moves onto a ghost of a lighthouse keeper that messes with the laws of physics, and ends with a visit to another dog in the Scooby Doo family, Grandpa Scooby.

 Excalibur Scooby/Scooby's Luck Of The Irish/Scooby's Escape From Atlantis: This one starts with a minotaur, a statue of a giant four-armed cyclops, and crazy enough, a guy at a party wearing a creepy horse head mask. Next Scooby, Scrappy and Shaggy are menaced by an evil Merlin. And last they cross an angry leprechaun.

Cruisin' for a Bruisin': A stressed out Dr. Phibes takes a vacation to get away from the Dog und Hippy Boy and ends up on the same cruise with Shaggy and Scooby Doo.",1424304000,41,3592,4.82516339869281

There are no Special Features in this set.

And it's important to NOTE, that regardless of what other websites may say, and what earlier reviews have said, the episodes A Halloween Hassle at Dracula's Castle Parts I and II from the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"" are NOT on this DVD set.

As much as I enjoyed this brand-new 2013 Halloween episode, this set has the fewest number of new-to-DVD Scooby episodes of all the recent 13 Spooky Tales compilation sets. And to make matters worse, they repeated one episode from the last set released. Fortunately, the next 13 Spooky Tales set - Ruh-Roh Robot will reverse the trend.

And as a Halloween themed set, there were other Halloween episodes that could and should have been included, like the aforementioned A Halloween Hassle at Dracula's Castle, or The Headless Horseman of Halloween. And for you Scrappy-haters, there are only 4 out of the 13 episodes that feature him, only one of which is new.

So, if you are a Scooby-Doo completist, then this set is recommended for you. But, if you are trying to get the most bang for your buck of new episodes, then you are better off to continue waiting for better compilations or possible complete series sets of the remaining series. If nothing else, at least I hope this set gets us one step closer to getting a complete series release of the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"".",1379548800,49,6659,7.117359413202934

5745633,1,B00CWR111G,This Dvd set is garbage except for the new episode it is not worth it. a hassle at dracula's castle is not even on here instead warner brothers ripped off the consumers again and added a Scooby doo Halloween from what's new Scooby doo instead of it.

5745634,3,B00CWR111G,"Alright I love classic scooby doo a bunch. I buy every unreleased classic episodes from the 70's-80's, not to say I don't buy modern scooby shows and movies but the classics were and always will be my favorites. Warner brothers are really being a pain in the neck with there releases of 80's scooby in particular becuase of scrappy doos inclusion in all the shows. I still enjoy these however and like to see them slowly but surly geting released. The particular episode from The New Scooby Doo Mysteries (1984) A Halloween Hastle in Dracula's Castle is a favorite of mine even though evey monster is real. Why I wasn't so crazy about this set is because i already own most of the episodes on this one, but warner bros. still gets my business for the I few I don't own. I am a really hardcore collector so technically if you just casually pick a few DVD's up here and there for your kids/family this collection will be just fine because most if not all the episodes will be new to you. However hardcore collectors shoud look trough the episode list below  before buying.

1. Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Scarecrow
2. Who's Afraid Of The Big Bad Werewolf
3. A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts
4. Which Witch is Which?
5. A Tiki Scare Is No Fair
6. Scared a Lot in Camelot
7. Hang in There, Scooby-Doo
8. Snow Job Too Small
9. The Stoney Glare Stare
10. A Halloween Hassle at Dracula's Castle, Part I
11. A Halloween Hassle at Dracula's Castle, Part II
12. Scoobra Kadoobra
13. Scooby In Kwackyland

Overall most of the episodes could pass off as halloween episodes though not actually taking place at halloween time other than the very misplaced A Tiki Scare is no Fair, Snow Job to Small, and Hang in There, Scooby-Doo ,Snow Job to Small released in the Winter/Christmas set so that one being on this set is rediculous,
Hang in There, Scooby-Doo on the other hand hasn't been released so even though it dosn't feel like a halloween episode it's inclusion makes the set more worth the buy. I'm really looking foward to the new halloween special on the set.

Overall, they could've rereleased some actual Halloween episodes, or find other new releases instead of episodes released in so many other collections. 3/5",1376697600,9,2204,4.586294416243655

8586999,5,B00CWR111G,"Scooby Doo has a lot of Halloween-themed mysteries, but only a couple of them surfaced here (and one other in the Around the World set). But it's still worthy of owning alongside the other 13 Spooky Tales sets, even though it has 1 repeat from the Christmas set (Snow Job Too Small). It even features 2 episodes of The 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, and the 2003 Halloween special (A Scooby Doo Halloween), and an all-new one from 2013 when this set was released (The Spooky Scarecrow)! At least 3 of the feature-length Scooby Movies took place on or around Halloween, sold separately of course, as of Spring 2017; those being The Ghoul School, The Goblin King, & Frankencreepy! Be sure to add Run for Your Rife to your 13 Spooky Tales sets, or your holiday collections, today! ""Scooby-Dooby-Doo!""",1496016000,2,791,4.697841726618705

8587003,2,B00CWR111G,"This DVD collection has an added security feature that caused an incredible headache for me. The only way to play them is to unhook my ENTIRE home theater system and only hook up the DVD player to the t.v. That means no speakers, cable, t.v. converter, game systems, ect. can be hooked up in order to get these stupid DVD's to properly play! I understand the purpose of this is to make it more difficult to reproduce the DVD, but to make me have to go through all that for a scooby doo DVD is ludicrous. Ridiculous",1473984000,,514,4.309278350515464
