Only thing about it is that Lwaxana's new hubby wants to keep her imprisoned and take away her baby when it is born; and the mother is never allowed to see her child according to Tavnian law girls are raised by women, girls by men, there fore going back on his promise to treat her as if she were his wife rather than his property- and you don't want to try to imprison a fireball like Lwaxana Troi.  And wouldn't it just figure that the only one who can help her keep her baby is the main one whose been avoiding her from day one of their meeting - Odo!
You have got see how! It's a real chick flick with a kick!",978998400,7,763,4.114093959731544

Using  some strange energy field she allows Jake to write more than he has ever  written before, addicted to this ladies strange field Jake becomes a  walking talking Zombie. It takes ages for everyone to realises, which just  means we have to sit through 40 minutes of rubbish, a lame script that  wastes the talent of Ciroc Loftman and Avery Brooks.",966729600,2,494,4.620689655172414
