The item bought was in excellent condition and served its purpose well.  Nothing can compare and have nothing ill to say of it, nor do I have anything else to mention that needs concern. Highly recommend for anyone who shops on the internet!  Amazon is always the best!",1401926400,,427,4.902777777777778
7925085,1,B00004WG5W,Ab Fab has become a cult among us baby boomers!  We relate to all the episodes.,1126137600,,79,3.9375
7925086,5,B00004WG5W,"ALL fans of this series should enjoy this ""best of"" tape.  The bloopers are always a special treat for any show but even more fun with this one.  They humanize the already beloved actors even more to us, the fans.  I did enjoy the little video and song at the end also.  I had never heard the Pet Shop Boys song about this show before.  Quite dancy and fun.
Pour yourself a vueve & bourb....relax and enjoy Sweetie Darlings!!",1024617600,3,425,4.329113924050633
