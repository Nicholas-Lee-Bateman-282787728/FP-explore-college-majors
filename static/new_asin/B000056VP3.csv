1400617,5,B000056VP3,"To say that this is just a football movie would be a very shallow interpretation, it is so much more than that.  This movie is heartwarming and gripping from the first opening logo all the way to the end.
To story is like this:  two separate football teams (one white and one black) are forced to de-segregate into one team with Denzel Washington as their coach.  At first they hate each other because they are different.  But in time they form a bond, a brotherhood, and a friendship, and learn to see past their differences.  It may sound sappy if you haven't seen it, but this is the best movie of its genre.
If you think it's just another lame live-action Disney film, think again.  This goes way beyond that and explores the theme of friendship with just the right ammount of sentimentality.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.  Parents:  it's rated PG for some mild words and tense situations.  Most Highly reccomended.",981676800,8,924,4.579268292682927
1400618,5,B000056VP3,"As a coach I found this movie motivating and a good reminder that coaching is not all fun and games.  It reminded me that coaching is about preparing players for life outside of the sport in which they play.  This is evidenced by the success of many of the real-life people portrayed in this movie.
I absolutely loved the relationship between the Washington and Patton characters.  Just when I thought that their relationship had run its course and things were about to come to a head....
I highly recommend this movie to all who want to see a movie that has suspense, comedy and action.  If you only buy one movie this year, this one should be seriously considered.",981244800,2,666,4.571428571428571
1400619,3,B000056VP3,"This is a great football movie.  It shows the intensity of the game and the challenges that this team (The Titans) had to overcome.  Denzel Washington plays the newly hired coach to the Titans, an all white football team.  The main theme of this movie is the interacial going ons and the belief that people from different societies can get along and become friends.  Other than that, we get to watch great football scenes where the hits just keep on coming.  I for one think this is one of Denzel's best roles.  If you're in the mood for a good drama and love football, then try this one out, you just might like it.",979516800,2,616,4.359649122807017
1400620,4,B000056VP3,"I really enjoyed this movie. I even saw it twice. It was deep, but witty at the same time. The plot and script were very good. And the actors did a nice job. The only problem I had with it was it's predictabilty. Oh- and the foreshadowing at the begining was cool too.",979430400,,268,4.0754716981132075
1400621,5,B000056VP3,"I am not a football fan and I did not expect to like this movie. But what a surprise!  There is more to this movie than football.  Growing up in the 70's I lived and went to school in a predominantly white area, so I can understand what it must have been like for BOTH groups of students to be forced to mix.  Not knowing what to expect from each other, all they had to go on were prejudiced stereotypes.  All of the young actors in this movie were fabulous and Denzel was great as always. This movie was filmed in Atlanta, and I got the fun of being an extra in the stands at the championship football game.  Even though I saw about 10-15 takes of it, the final play was much more exciting from my perspective in the stands than it appears on film.",979344000,2,749,4.102739726027397
1400622,4,B000056VP3,"'Remember The Titans' is a good movie. But the use of racial injustice in this film seemed rushed, and discomforting to watch. The movie just doesn't truly heed well in leading up to how this event led to increased equality among the characters of the story. This movie sort of seems somewhat like another movie, 'Varsity Blues.' Although they have almost nothing in common, they both emphasize the will to win and the importance of winning in football. But unlike 'Varsity Blues', this movie installs a message about racial hatred. Overall, I found that the parts where the African-American and white players had rollercoaster situations where they fought at times, and then celebrated a moment later made the movie flow like the movie was rushed. Thus I can only give it 4 out of 5.",978912000,2,784,4.814814814814815

1400650,5,B000056VP3,"This is my favorite sports move ever. Every actor was outstanding and drove the message home. Now this does get heavily into race at a volatile time in our country. I mention that because some people are super sensitive about race these days. It will make you laugh, cry, get mad, and that is exactly what it was supposed to do. Fantastic and underrated film. To me this is what Denzel should have won the Oscar for.",1517443200,,416,4.415584415584416

1400655,3,B000056VP3,"This is a very good movie.  Set in 1971.  This is a story of a all white High School getting integrated.  When their very successful football  coach is replaced by a black coach and black players being mixed into the team.  You can feel the tension not only from the football team but from the whole school,  As the Head Coach Denzel Washington is very good.  This is probably my favorite movie of his.  And it is the kind of story that stays with you as the players start to bond.  And win.  My favorite sports movie is Hoosiers.

My only complaint is that when streaming it, during the last 30 to 45 minutes it began to drag.  It got so bad that figures were blurred and that is a shame as it was coming to a close.

1400987,4,B000056VP3,"Remember the Titans is truly an enjoyable movie and far above average, considering the typical fare.  The racial friction wasn't as contentious as portrayed, but I understand the Hollywood treatment of such issues to add ""oomph.""  Hayden Panettiere as Sheryl Yoast is why I rated this at four stars rather than five -- I simply would have enjoyed the movie more without the role.  Yoast had four daughters, and the real-life Sheryl was not fanatical.  I've seen quite a few action movies with a precocious, annoying young girl, and these characters detract rather than add.  (A recent example is Crowe's daughter role in ""The Nice Guys,"" also with Gosling.)  These couple of beefs aside, I would certainly recommend it as a worthwhile watch.",1483401600,,741,4.983739837398374

This movie depicts a high school in 1960s Virginia where Jim Crow Laws and Massive Resistance have just begun to unravel. The soundtrack to this movie alone is reason to enjoy it- but the writing is great and the movie is educational. While our fourth graders didn't understand everything, they surely enjoyed this movie.

1401675,5,B000056VP3,"Remember the Titans (2000) directed by Boaz Yakin is an awesome, must see movie! The humor, the love, and the teamwork make it a truly inspirational movie. Remember the Titans is a movie about two high schools that get integrated together. Each school comes from a different part of the neighborhood meaning one school is predominately white while the other school is predominately African American. When these two schools come together it takes a village to make things work out. The movie is centered on football so if you are a football fan, sit tight! Each school had a football team and with the new integration they are forced to play together at the end of the summer training camp.
Each team comes with negative attitudes toward the other team which creates a big conflict for the players and the coach. The coach of the African American team becomes the head coach of the team as a whole. In order to have a successful season, these players have to come together to not only work with each other but to learn to listen to the new head coach.
The head coach played by Denzel Washington is a very strong character and is not afraid to push the limits. One thing that he does thats a very powerful action is make the two teams sit together on the bus on the way to their summer training camp. It makes the players bond in a new and innovative way.
The other coach on the other hand has trouble accepting the assistant position and sometimes does not support the new head coach which creates conflicts to the team. As far as good teaching strategies go, this particular one of not having a united front with you partner, in this case being the head coach, creates an unhealthy relationship for everybody.",1427846400,,1709,4.570032573289902
1401676,5,B000056VP3,"""Remember the Titans"" a great movie about people coming together, and over coming their previous notions. The football team of Alexandria after integrating the all black school with the all white school faced many struggles with racism. The team had to learn how to overcome their racist views in order to be able to work together as a great football team. The town still wasn't accepting of the black citizens, but on the field the players were treated equally. They got playing time based on their skills and not by the color of their skin. This movie is definitely worth watching, and is great for all ages!",1427760000,,610,4.710280373831775

1401699,5,B000056VP3,"""Remember the Titans"" is the true story in Alexandria, Virginia during the 1970's. The ""white"" high school and the ""black"" high school are forced to integrate into one during the heat of the civil rights movement as the town explodes in racial havoc. Just as the Caucasian football coach Yoast is about to enter the Virginian high school football hall of fame, he is demoted to assistant head coach when the two high schools combine. The new head coach is Coach Boone (Denzel Washington), an experienced black football coach that recently moved there. On top of the tension felt between Boone and Yost, they also have to bring the two teams together amidst racial prejudices.

Solid performances from the cast-this is one of Washington's best movies. (Yeah I know, I say that every time)  This is  the story about learning to come together despite racial differences and learn to get along, despite generations of hard prejudices. Washington's character Coach Boone is, in his own words, a ""mean cuss, but the same mean cuss to everyone, black or white."" Coach Boone, with the help of Coach Yost, help to mold the mixed race team into a tough football team. It is a perfect example of what we can do when welay aside our differences and work together.

First rate! This is one of my all-time favorite movies.",1424822400,,1308,4.774336283185841

Even if you aren't a football fan this is a great movie with a great story line. I love how it shows the realism of racism but also shows how the 2 sides (white and black) struggle with trying to go with what's in their hearts versus their family member's feelings.,1405641600,,368,4.3478260869565215

1402265,1,B000056VP3,"Boy oh boy, the trailers don't do this movie justice. It is THAT bad. This is my opinion of the movie, so don't be hatin'. There is a number of things wrong with this movie that if I were to go into full detail, I could write a book. So, to make a long story short, here are the highlights of the bad things and good things about this movie.
The bad stuff
- lopsided race war (whites are portrayed as the bad guys and blacks the good guys)
- sometimes confusing as to why something happened
- so many ""inspirational speeches"" it gets repetitive and comical
- predictable in a bad way
- Christianity just thrown into the fray without a second thought
- morality isn't present in some cases (e.g. a mother goes to a football game while her son is paralyzed)
- a MAN-TO-MAN kiss...bleeeecccchhh!!!!!
the good stuff
- a good premise
There are a few neat touches here and there, but the overall package clashes with what the movie tries to accomplish.",1405036800,,946,4.380681818181818

1402298,5,B000056VP3,"This movie really holds up.  Haven't seen it in probably 5 years, but it is as good now, as the first time I saw it.  Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance as always.  But the supporting cast is wonderful.  They are perfectly cast and the story line very cohesive.  This is a very inspiring movie.",1403395200,,308,4.527272727272727
1402299,2,B000056VP3,"The movie is the best. It brings out how hatred and racism can be thrown away by being team members and when one player can't be a team member he is asked to be taken off the team by someone who is the same color as he is. Also when the town sees this they also see that people of color can work together. You may not like me , but judge me not the color of my skin.",1402358400,,366,3.6455696202531644

1402301,5,B000056VP3,"I have had this movie in two previous DVD incarnations -- one full screen and one widescreen (preferred).  I use it in teaching a lot.  I teach Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People at a university and use this movie as the basis for an essay final (since it shows all 7 Habits being played out).  The BluRay is much more like the theater experience.  It's not startling, but it is clearer and the sound is perfect.  If you're not acquainted with the story, it is one of the best sports-based yarns out there.  Of course, it is also a metaphor for the entire struggle for integration and the end-goals of the entire Civil Rights Movement.  Since it's a real story based on real people it's also highly creditable.  For today's young people who only read about that period as history, it is also an eye-opener.  The movie is recommended in any format you find it; the BluRay is recommended if you have a system capable of demonstrating its virtues.",1400630400,3,953,4.526315789473684

1402306,5,B000056VP3,We watched this film because my son was invited to meet Coach Boon and we wanted him to know more about him.  This movie is extremely well done and shows the subtle nuances of the problems of this era in terms of human rights issues.  Both the coaches in this film were heros.  They learned from each other and they helped each other accomplish goals and to fight against bigotry. Interestingly the film makers did not leave out the fact that women's rights trailed behind issues of race in making several slight references to this in people's responses to the little girls in the film.,1399593600,,586,4.561904761904762

1402344,5,B000056VP3,We enjoy this movie immensely when we watch it periodically.  It is a look back at integration of schools in Virginia via a coach (Denzel Washingston) and the players.  The team's winning season brought most of a community together and made others start thinking.,1393200000,,263,4.954545454545454
1402345,5,B000056VP3,"Great, great, great movie...this powerful movie of racial discard in a small Southern town, addresses a social issue with raw emotional tension resulting from the integration of a local high school. It teaches a lesson about acceptance, respect, and adjusting to racial differences. While Denzel Washington the African American football coach, who plays Coach Boone and Will Patton the Caucasian football coach, who plays Coach Yoast are phenomenal the movie is stolen by the interaction of the team players. There is racial tension as a result of the high school which is forced by court order to integrate the school the turmoil builds between these two coaches when the popular ""white"" head high school football coach is replaced by a ""black"" coach.

The movie is based on actual events, it teaches a lesson without screaming it in your face. While viewing this movie sometime you will laugh, cry and wiser about the explosive issues of integration. As the movie unfolds it shows how the team becomes the unifying symbol for the community as the boys (football players) unite, the coaches and the adults in the community also unite as they learn to trust  and depend on each other.",1392854400,6,1184,4.974747474747475

I have it on Blu Ray, but I wanted to be able to watch it on the go as well. I would very much recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who love sports movies.",1392681600,,306,4.032786885245901

1402359,5,B000056VP3,I just bought the director's cut DVD to replace / upgrade my worn VHS copy. I also own the CD soundtrack too!!!!!!!!! This is one of the greatest trure sports movies ever made. Even Walt Disney himself would have loved it if he were still living today. Peter Smith,1392508800,,264,4.408163265306122

1402361,4,B000056VP3,"I had feared that this film being a Disney work, would whack us over the head with a moral about racism or something like that.  Thankfully, that never happened.  Yes, there was racism in the story and we got the impression that it was wrong, but no one ever held up a sign or gave a long monologue about the issue...the film just told it's story and the message was naturally recieved, just the way I like it.  I don't give it five stars simply because it sometimes brings up some of the many cliches found in sports movies.  Yes, these events all happened in real life, but I just wish I wasn't feeling like it was all done so perfectly in the film's plot...but it is a Disney movie.  Anyway, Denzel Washington shines as the new football coach for T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia.  It was nice to see a coach who didn't just go ahead and lay out enormous, life-changing ambitions for his new team.  Instead, he came with an attitude that said ""this is what we're gonna do and this is how we're going to do it.""  Plus, I always like it when a coach is shown to have an education when so many coach characters are portrayed as having roughly a 5th-grade -level of learning.  I also like the interactions between Mr. Washington and Will Patton, who plays his predesessor/new defensive coordinator...there is obvious tension in the beginning which both men obviously carefully crafted for the big screen and then we get a chance to witness the transformation into mutual respect or even some sort of friendship.  It was thanks to these two men that the issues surrounding racism were properly played out as I had discribed earlier.  Of course, a coach is nothing without his team, and a group of young men nicely play the dynamic of the Titans, who must have an undefeated season in order for their coach to keep his job.  Overall, this is a great film for audience members of varying ages and I highly reccomend it.  Enjoy.",1391990400,2,1941,4.511428571428572

It doesn't matter if your black, white, orange, or yellow if you learn to love a man's soul and really get to know someone you can overcome almost any obstacle.

1402480,5,B000056VP3,"I graduated from Hammond High school in Alexandria in '68 - 3 years before this movie begins. Everyone I still know from Hammond loved the movie.

We actually never thought much about segregation. People just went to the school that was nearest their homes, and Hammond was in the middle and upper middle class all white area of the city. Naturally everyone had great pride for their high school.. school spirit was encouraged at Hammond. Earlier I had lived in DC and went to the nearest public school at which I was the only white girl in my classes so I am familiar with desegregation... my mother went to the same school when it was all white.

The chaos of making Hammond a 9th and 10th grade school would have upset any community, so it exacerbated the desegregation problem the city strove to achieve through court orders. Built in was a lot of resentment - Hammond was our neighborhood school with traditions, but there was no other way to integrate the races and even social classes of our city. I didn't go to school when the movie took place, but can you imagine giving up the pride and tradition of your school ... being transferred to a school that had been your rival - TC Williams in this case, even IF racial integration wasn't the reason?

The movie does a good job of showing the anger people felt for the disruptions. This was our community high school. We were not southern. Most of the people I knew had parents who were related to the government in DC who had arrived after WWII from around the midwest and northeast - some parents had grown up in DC and were part of the ""white flight"". In that respect the movie makes it seem southern. NO! this was definitely not a southern culture school despite being in Virginia. Hardly anyone had a southern accent or would EVER say they were southern.

All that aside, this movie is great because it epitomizes the problem of desegregation that much of the country went through. I believe the political landscape we are in today had its roots back then.

As a military kid I had always gone to school with all the different races in our country... we took it in stride. I also went to several high schools so it's not too surprising the military kids in the movie were the most accommodating to the changes. Plus change was ingrained into us early. But much of the kids at Hammond had gone to grade school and junior high together. They must have been really upset to have their childhood dream of high school at Hammond dashed. This disappointment fanned the flames of resentment. It's all in the past now, but it is an educational experience to see it 40+ years later.

I give this movie an A+ for the situation. (BTW everyone knew Coach Yoast. He was an extremely popular teacher/coach and a true professional educator.)",1374105600,,2786,4.550898203592815

1402510,4,B000056VP3,"It is a little dated in that it deals so much with the civil rights movement of the early '70's.  When ""Julius"" hangs a poster of the two American track medalists from the 1968 Mexico City Olympics giving the ""power salute"" from the podium, he and his white roommate get into a fist fight.  I remember what a controversy those athletes caused with their gesture of defiance, as if to say ""We're good enough to win gold medals for America, but we still have to ride in the back of the bus.""

That said, it is a good representation of a team of players and coaches from disparate backgrounds with varied methods of achieving goals who can conquer their differences to reach their objective.  It is a testimonial to the true greatness of Gerry Bershier as a player and as a human being.

It also gives us all a chance to see Ryan Gosling when he still had one foot firmly planted in the Mickey Mouse Club.",1369958400,,902,4.377245508982036

This movie seemed to end right after it started.  I cried after watching it the second time as well as the first.  It is more than a story about high school football.  It is a true story about American history; about a time and place that should bring us shame.  It is a story of teamwork, of friendship, of selflessness.

1402528,5,B000056VP3,"Just to add  another ""5 star"" vote and suggest this one has special value to high school or even college instructors teaching drama/stage production (or anyone trying to acquire some skills in this area) as this is one of the best group performances ever. Denzel of course is one of the few from the modern era who can to hold a candle to the prior generation's giants (Lancaster/Douglas/Holden/Lemmon/Fonda) but the rest of the cast is outstanding both individually and as a group, the group aspect being critical to making the movie work. The subtleties of each individual's meshing with the others is really something to behold. The only things I have seen lately that can compare are ""The Blind Side"" (another school-appropriate movie in a more contemporary setting) and possibly the TV production ""Justified"" (any budding screenwriters could do no better than check the latter out!)

I don't think this movie even got any Academy Award nominations, sad as it's far better in every aspect that most of the ""major"" productions that ooze out of Hollywood lately. It doesn't exactly match our current situation as all the racism portrayed is the white people's fault but that is probably appropriate for the time and place setting. I'm sad to say it looks like we have gone downhill in the 40 years since the events portrayed occurred, black president/AG and all.",1367366400,,1364,4.951965065502184

Now, add to that the implications that arise from the racist divisions in southern USA in the 60s and you have a really fun to watch movie.
And you have Danzel Washington here, that I think appears in many ""black"" struggles in movie history, and you also have Will Patton, on of those those actors that are really great and has not been recognized as such. He has a great calm way of acting, that makes you like him,
even if he ever played the devil

The movie is not complex and deep, but it is built in a way that the audience can enjoy football scenes (loud visual effects during tackles), and combine that with the struggle for integration.

The two coaches have to learn to get along and coach together. Yost becomes the defensive coach under Boone and soon the two actually learn to get along. Even when Coach Boone tells Coach Yost to quite coddeling the black players and calls him on being a softie the two still get along. The only downside to the movie is that the football players are kind of the sterotypical ""jock"" type and are not really fleshed out enough. The film centers more on the Coach and the race relations of white/black, but does kind of pull it out in the end. When you see the end it does kind of leave you with a feel good sense but only kind of. All in all I give it a 3.",1356480000,,1103,4.359223300970874

Inspired by a true story, Director Boaz Yakin, directs the movie, Remember The Titans that was written by Gregory Allen Howard. Adding on to other moving sport movies, where the new unpopular coach builds up the `weaker' team to victory, this movie adds the element of other problems that occurs in the team; the relationship between the blacks and whites on the team. Racial segregation is a big factor in this movie and the new Black football coach, Herman Boone, portrayed by Denzel Washington, does a good job of creating relationships and connections between the two races.

Summary

This movie occurs in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, where T.C Williams High School was recently forced to integrate black students into the school. Because of the integration, the former head coach, Bill Yoast (Will Patton) was replaced by an African American coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). This act causes the team to be infuriated, which leads to the students and even the parents pledging to boycott. In an effort to ease racial tension, Coach Boone offers Yoast a position as the assistant coach. Yoast eventually agrees to this post to stop the boycott from happening.
After solving this issue, the players head off to Gettysburg for a football boot camp. As they were loading onto two busses, Coach Boone notices the division of people by race. He then orders each player to sit next to another of the opposite race, which will also then be their roommates for the duration of the camp. Tensions among the two factions erupts during the beginning of the camp, when the former captain, Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) gets in a fight with Julius Campbell (Wood Harris). During lunch time, segregation is apparent, except for a white player, Louie Lastik (Ethan Suplee), who decides to sit with his black teammates. As time goes on, the camp proves effective. Physical workout has made the players fit, but more importantly, so has the improvement of relationships between the two races. The bond between the players become evident when both races alike sit next to each other in the cafeteria.
As the `new and improved' team returns back from camp, relationships and friendships unravel and fall apart. It was only when a few teammates, mostly Gerry and Julius, were able to rekindle the relationships back to what it was like in the camp.
The football season starts and it is shown that their teamwork and cooperation proves worthy when they have an undefeated season. The spirits of the players take a big dip when their linebacker, Gerry, is caught in a car crash and is paralysed from the waist down. This incident affected Julius the most, as they had become good friends. Despite the injury, Gerry's spirit is still high and he encourages and supports the team in their Championship game from his hospital bed.
After their state championship win, the movie leaves the whole community with a lesson of racism.

Characters and Actors

Coach Herman Boone, played by Denzel Washington, portrayed the coach as a fearless, smart, devoted, and determined guy. Despite the racial slurs said to him, his perseverance leads the team into victory. Owner of two Golden Globe awards and a Tony award, Denzel Washington portrays Herman Boone with great character, life, and emotion.
Assistant Coach, Bill Yoast, played by Will Patton, has shown a great perspective transformation on race, from the beginning till the end. Yoast is first seen as the head coach of the Titans team, and is later replaced with a black coach. Yoast does not welcome him well, but reluctantly takes the position of assistant coach, when it was offered to him by Coach Boone. Patton plays this character well with emotion and passion.
Linebacker Gerry Bertier, played by Ryan Hurst, portrayed the character as a strong athletic that is fit to be the captain of the football team. In the start, Gerry is known to be the tough bully that holds the authority in the team. It is shown that as the movie develops, so does Gerry. Instead of the bully image, he becomes the true leader of the team. His once hatred for teammate Julius Campbell, becomes a strong relationship that is undeniable. It is shown in one scene that Gerry decides to go with Julius instead of his girlfriend. Hurst is the perfect choice for Bertier, as he acts him with true dedication.
Julius Campbell, played by Wood Harris, portrayed the character as the `black version' of teammate Gerry Bertier. His character is filled with confidence and loyalty. His character was deeply affected when Bertier had been injured from a car crash. Harris provides this character with emotion and the audience with satisfaction.

Historical Accuracy

If it wasn't apparent already, this movie was over dramatised and exaggerated. There were a lot of inaccuracies depicted in this movie. For example, during the drill camp, the movie shows the strong racial tensions due to the difference of race. An interview of the Titans team conducted by ESPN has said that: ""No. Coach Boone, Coach Yoast, and many players have said that there was tension at camp, but it existed primarily because of competition for positions on the team"". Ronnie ""Sunshine"" Bass also states that he wanted to make the team and the fight to get a spot on the team was critical and slim. Another inaccuracy was that the character Alan Bosley played by Ryan Gosling, Ray Budds played by Burgess Jenkins, and Emma (Gerry Bertier's girlfriend) played by Kate Bosworth weren't real. They were added in the movie to emphasize certain points of the movie; selflessness, when Alan gave up his position to Petey (Donald Faison). Another character inaccuracy would be Ronnie ""Sunshine"" Bass. He was a real character, but his portrayal was very much different to this real person. First of all, he did not kiss Gerry Bertier in the locker rooms, and he did not do Tai Chi outside of the school. In the movie, teammates and the coach teased him about his long hair, but in fact a lot of the other teammates had long hair as well.
Furthermore, the Titans team was shown to be the `underdogs' that lost in the beginning of the games, and end up winning. These scenes were not true as the Titans had dominated every single game they played. Also, the Titans never danced and sang before the game as warm-ups and the scene where a brick was thrown through Coach Boone's window was also fake. What really happened was that a toilet was thrown through the window. Herman Boone says: ""There wasn't a brick thrown through my window, It was something far more devastating to any human being than a brick could be. I guess Disney, being the family movie production company that it is, felt that to depict a toilet stool coming through your window was a bit much..."". There were actually many other inaccuracies that was created or changed by Disney to satisfy the audience. Though there were many inaccuracies, there were a few important points that were accurate. For example, the threat to boycott from the team was real, as well as the inspirational speech at the Gettysburg cemetery (except it was mostly the tour guide talking instead of Boone).

Thoughts on the movie:

Watching it as a family movie, I would rate this movie a 4.5/5, as it was a very touching, dramatic, well acted, and well written movie. But as a critic and looking at the historical events and accuracy, I would rate it a 1.5/5. It had a lot of made-up scenes to make the movie seem more dramatic and to fulfill the audiences needs. Comments from other viewers, magazines, websites, and friends have shown that the basic plot, the actors/actresses, and the screenplay made the movie worthy to view. Should you watch this film, be sure it is just for pleasure viewing, rather than a movie for collecting historical facts back in the 70s. Historical facts would be much more accurate if collected from other documentaries, or interviews from the actual Titans themselves.",1355184000,4,8019,4.868131868131868
1402595,4,B000056VP3,"Remember the Titans is a good movie that incorporates a ""good feeling"" attitude towards the events that had taken place. A. O. Scott from the New York Times said, ""Whether you're black or white, these moments are likely to put a lump in your throat and inspire a justified swelling of civic pride. On the playing field, at least, our better selves can triumph over our baser instincts."" This movie makes us feel like we have come a long way from the segregated days of Jim Crow during the early 1960s.

Summary:

 This movie takes place in Alexandria, Virginia during the year 1971 when the TC Williams High School was forced to integrate with African American people. The High School's current head football coach was Coach Bill Yoast. Since the integration, he was replaced as head coach by one Herman Boone who is an African American. Many of the school's football players such as Gerry Bertier - the team's linebacker, was infuriated and upset when they learned about Coach Yoast's replacement. Right from the beginning of the film, Bill Yoast antagonizes Herman Boone as the one who stole his job. After loosing his job as the head coach of the school's football team, Bill Yoast starts considering other jobs outside their town. In an attempt to ease racial tension, Herman Boone offers Bill Yoast a job as assistant head coach. Bill Yoast refuses his offer, as he didn't want to work under a ""black"" person. Bill Yoast then reconsiders his job offer after many white football players in the team pledged to boycott the team.
 After it's initial stages of conflict between the coaches and players of different races, they were off to football camp. Right as they were ready to head off, Coach Herman Boone notices that both busses were somehow racially divided between the whites and the blacks. He immediately orders everyone off both busses and assigns one black person and one white person to sit next onto each other on the bus and to be their each other's roommates. Both blacks and whites were reluctant to sit next to each other during the buss ride. As they began training together, the racial tension between the blacks and white s were apparent. Coach Herman Boone was disappointed on what he was witnessing in front of him. Louie Lastik - another white player in the team, decides to sit with his black teammates during lunchtime. As he sat down, his fellow black teammate questioned him why he decided to sit with them during lunch. Louie Lastik then continues saying that he doesn't belong to anyone. About midway through lunch, Coach Herman Boone calls on Louie and asks him one thing he learned about anyone of his fellow black teammates. Coach Boone was surprised to see that Louie managed to get along with his black teammates so well. Coach Boone praises him and proceeds to ask anyone else of both races if they knew anything else about one other player of the other race. To his disappointment, no one had anything to say. He then ordered everyone to interact with a teammate of the other race three times a day so that each of them can learn something about a teammate of the other race.
Slowly, a bond between the teammates of both races began to show. One early morning, Coach Boone wakes everyone up at 3:00 a.m. in the morning. He then announces that everyone was going to ""take a nice job in the woods."" The coach then brings the whole team to a cemetery where the Battle of Gettysburg took place. He then gave an inspirational speech about hatred. It was at this point that most of the team members have been open to the other race and was interacting well united. Tension between the races in school and in the football team had mostly died down.
The Titans then continued their football season being undefeated on every game they play. By this point, the Titans - which were the name of their football team - had gained quite a support form the community. During their semi-final game, Bill Yoast was then informed by a coworker of his that he would be ""inducted"" as a candidate for the ""Hall of Fame"" if the Titans lost this game. As the game continued, it became apparent to Yoast that the game official was calling racially bias calls against the Titans. Yoast then threatened to expose this scandal if the official continued to call unfairly. The Titans then won the semi-final game. Due to Yoast's actions, he was informed that he had lost his candidacy for the ""Hall of Fame."" When the whole team was out celebrating their victory, the main character Bertier was paralyzed in a car accident as a truck slammed into the side of his Camaro. Shocked, the whole team then went to the hospital as supporters for Bertier. Even though the team had lost a player, they continued to win the championship game.  10 years after that game. The whole team reunites at Bertier's funeral where everyone mourned the loss of a great teammate.

Characters and Actors:

 Denzel Washington plays the role of Herman Boone as the new head football coach for the TC Williams High School. I felt that he gave a particularly excellent performance being the main protagonist of the film. He managed to give out a sense of leadership and control over issues he ironically couldn't control such as how other people felt about racism and integration at the school. It is nice to see him play a character in which people have to look up to as he often plays an inspirational and rational character.
 Will Patton played the character of Bill Yoast. I felt that Patton managed to pull an exceptional performance being able to so accurately show how a white person would typically act during those times. He managed to show how he had to be somewhat in authority yet he still had to report to the head coach, which was Denzel Washington. Hayden Panettiere played Will Patton's on screen daughter. I personally felt that Panettiere's character was at times slightly annoying and distraction towards the development of the plot. I felt that she wanted the spotlight to be shone on her for as long as possible. Maybe it would have been less distracting if her character was less dramatized and exaggerated. This would have lightened the viewing experience of the film.
 Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris both performed extremely well all throughout the film. Portraying a dynamic character is difficult because you have to show particular actions and behavioral changes at specific times to show that they are actually developing as a character. I felt that both Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris both managed to act out these roles with little to no problems at all. Watching the film, I could really feel the emotional and physical tension between the both of them being the one of the main characters of the film. A. O. SCOTT from the New York Times said, "" The relationship between the two men gradually mutates from hostile suspicion to grudging respect to loyalty and trust."" I strongly agree with his thought that both of them performed extremely well as dynamic characters in the film.
 The rest of the cast members representing the TC Williams High School football team played spectacular roles as each member of the team. As the movie was taking place, you could really feel the emotions being stirred in the air by the team members of both races. As they were fighting for the victory in each football game, you could almost see into each player's eyes and empathized with them. I felt that this film managed to show the strength's of each actor at its most desired moment. It was nice to see how each actor had their little time to shine all throughout the film. Overall, the actors played excellent performances, which greatly contributed with the powerful and inspirational message of the film.

Historical Accuracy:

 Although Remember the Titans was a good film by it, it greatly exaggerated and dramatizes the actual accounts of racial tension and hatred between the races. Jeff Merron published an ESPN article about the Remember the Titans film. In that article, Jeff Merron talks about the differences between the ""Reel Life"" in which the characters were depicted by actors and what truly happened in ""Real Life."" Here is where the movie takes a turn for the worst in terms of historical accuracy. According to Jeff Merron and from the DVD commentary, which had many of the real life people whom which were reenacted by actors, contained many over dramatized actions and events shown all throughout the film by many characters. Here are some of the notable differenced between ""Reel Life,"" and ""Real Life."" Bill Yoast in real life claims that his daughter was never that ""crazy"" about football though she did watch it and was always the first one on the field after the games. In the film, Bill Yoast's daughter, Sheryl Yoast appeared to be quite aggressive towards Herman Boone when she found out about her father loosing his job to him. Bill Yoast said ""she was never quite as aggressive as they depicted her in the film, but she was very angry."" I personally might have really liked Sherryl's character in the film if she hadn't been so ""crazy."" In the film where Sheryl had visited Herman Boone's house to play with his daughter, in reality, that actually never even took place. During the training camp, the film had a scene where Herman Boone woke everyone up at 3:00 a.m. for a jog, according to Jeff Merron; this actually never even took place. During the first day of school at TC Williams High School, the film showed aggressive protests taking place outside the school where in reality; there were just some fights and rock-throwing incidents. After school has started, the film showed racial tension between the whites and blacks where fights had been broken out. According to Joann Patton, who had dated Bill Yoast and taught English at TC Williams High School said that the students of both races actually adjusted very well. She also said ""the kids behaved a whole lot better than most of the adults.""
 Even though there were many inaccuracies shown in the film, there were still some details the movie got right. In the film where the whole team was on the bus separated racially, Herman Boone explained in the DVD commentary that this really did happen. He forced them to switch buses in order to racially mix them. Denzel Washington played this scene very well showing signs of authority and leadership in the film. The training camp is actually held at the Gettysburg College.

Final Thoughts:

 If I were to rate the movie as a movie by itself, I would give it an eight out of ten. I am taking into consideration the actor's performance, cinematography done by the director and the story line of the film. Remember the Titans is an inspiring film and appropriate for all to watch. But in terms of historical accuracy, I would probably give it a four out of ten as a score. The only reason I would give this film such a low score is because in the DVD commentary, the actual people whom were portrayed in the movie actually said that many of the key events in the film didn't even take place in real life. I guess Disney had to somehow make the movie much more interesting, dramatizing each and every little event to qualify the film as a ""docudrama."" The real life ""Titans"" and the events that took place at TC Williams High Schools was just a tone down, less dramatized version of what took place in the film. I guess the producers and writers had to make the movie dramatic so people would watch it in the first place.
 Based on the critical reviews of this film and my experiences watching this film, I can recommend this film to everyone as the screenplay and the storyline was excellent and well crafted. Though I would not use this film as a reference to writing a fact-based as many of the events that took place in the film didn't actually take place in real life. If you were to white a fact-base essay on the film, I highly recommend you watching the DVD commentary of Remember the Titans. The DVD commentary actually contains actual interviews of the real life people in which the film portrayed.",1355097600,,12038,4.702087286527514

1402597,5,B000056VP3,"Integration has been promoted after the Civil Rights Movement, however many white Americans refuse to join with the blacks. During the 1970's, it was the period when schools started to integrate and things were different. In the movie ""Remember the Titans"" directed by Boaz Yankin describes integration with a football story. Denzel Washington acts this story and it was a successful movie. The story starts off if the integration of a white and black school and this is when the problems started. The blacks were revolting and white players weren't willing to play with the other black kid. The movie was set in Alexandria, Virginia, which is a segregated city before.

 It was 1971 and T.C. Williams High School started to desegregated and merged black and white schools. Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) was a black coach who was hired in taking the coaching job for football. The original Bill Yoast (Will Patton) who the successful coach for the whites before was about to leave and he turned down Boone's offer to be assistant head coach. However many of the white players wanted Yoast to stay because they couldn't deal with the black coach. Yoast stayed with Boone as assistant coach and they worked together to form the strongest team. Originally, the team was separated and none of the whites or blacks coordinated with each other. Blacks were racially discriminated and they didn't work well together. Blue Stanton said, ""Does the term ""cruel and unusual punishment"" mean anything to you?"" This was from a black guy and these are powerful words coming from them. In history, cruel and unusual punishment is always put upon the blacks from the whites and it is terrible for the blacks.

 Later in the story, the team needed to cooperate together to win the championships. Coach Boone had different strategies for example, making each person room with another person for everyday. They had training camps and from the season, Boone and Yoast's black and white players learn to accept each other and work together. Coach Boone once said to them during practice ""This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg.... Hatred destroyed my family. You listen, and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed, just like they were. I don't care if you like each other or not, but you will respect each other. And maybe... I don't know, maybe we'll learn to play this game like men."" This powerful line united the students together and it showed how united the team can be to win. As they learn from each other, Boone and Yoast also learn from them and in turn, the whole town learns from the team, the Titans. Boone also said before, ""I'm not gonna talk to you tonight about winnin' and losin'. You're already winners 'cause you didn't kill each other up at camp."" Integrating with each other in a cam was extremely difficult and they achieved this goal. It changed people's views and equality was getting closer. Football showed how the blacks and whites could get together. Lastly, the team was united and the went on to fight their final game and achieved victory.

 This movie is a good story, but it isn't totally true. A lot of Northern Virginia Schools with Arlington and Fairfax county, the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church Schools were already integrated when T.C. Williams HS was opened and built. Boone was not the first African American football coach as there was Charles Price in 1966 that developed a successful football program at Langey. A lot of other schools already had integrated football and other types of sports teams near the region. This film had a lot of compilation of attitudes and actions and over feel for integration are schools.

 Even though the movie is based on a true story, there are still a lot of fictional or exaggerated things in the movie. This movie gives the impression that if schools had been integrated for a while before the Titan's perfect season, then there wouldn't bee a problem. This movie worked out too well and in reality, integration should be harder. There are a lot of other fictional scenes like a brick thrown through Coach Boone's window. A lot of the scenes that were created in this movie are for a better storyline and making the movie better. It differed from history and wasn't perfectly accurate.

 The title of this movie has a significant meaning to the story. The Titans are the name of the football team. Through this title, we know that the Titans are a symbol of integration and people should remember the significance of this. A quote from Sheryl Yoast, Bill Yoast's daughter, people say that it can't work, black and white; well here we make it work, everyday. We have our disagreements, of course, but before we reach for hate, always, always, we remember the Titans."" Titans represented the whites and the blacks getting together and they are a symbol of success. The Titans are a new level of desegregation and it showed America true equality.

 Remember the Titans is a fascinating movie and it really touches your heart. It might be a bit over exaggerated, but the story plot is sweet and wonderful in the end. It's good for happy movie and it showed progression and it's fun and warm to watch. Denzel Washington did a great job acting as a successful coach and in the movie, he showed integration and he was successful and he had great acting. It's a fun sports movie and anybody can watch and it really helps us understand more about America's segregation. This movie motivates you and we should all not miss out on this good movie.",1355011200,,5614,4.770339855818744

Like a handful of other sports movies, Remember the Titans portrays a coach building up his unruly team, with little to nothing in common, to win the championship. Yet, while this may sound like a typical clich, Remember the Titans proves to be something more. Unlike most movies, Remember the Titans does not just portray the football team's fight to glory. It also depicts the relationships that develops between the blacks and whites. Many critics have written it off as overly dramatic and at times, inaccurate. According to Times critic, Richard Schickel, `Maybe it's all true. But one is always a little discomfited when life, or a movie, imitates weary melodramatic patterns this slavishly'. While Remember the Titans is an intriguing and inspirational movie, for those who want to know an accurate retelling of the events that occurred that year in Alexandria, Virginia, one would be better off watching a less dramatized film.

Summary

 The movie is set in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971 where recently, TC Williams High School is forced to integrate. Seeking to satisfy the black community, the school board hires Herman Boone, an African American man, as the head coach. Such an act prompts parents and students alike to pose threats to boycott the football team. As summer trudges on, the TC Williams High School football team travels to Gettysburg for drill camp, which serves to tests relationships and break the barriers between each respective race. Boot camp prompts a turnaround for the team as interracial relationships begin to form. In the cafeteria, once a place where segregation was clear, black and white alike would sit together, with no regard to race. As the team find their way back from boot camp, relationships begin to fall out and things began to drift back to what it used to be, segregated. However, in an effort by Gerry, Julius and several other teammates, they begin to rekindle their bond where their dream, undefeated season truly begins. While certain obstacles threaten to block their path to the championship title, the TC Williams Titans score the state championship after a hard fought battle. Not only bringing home the title, but also teaching the community about race and what trivial a matter it really is. While the movie is predictable in many ways, the end leaves the viewer thoroughly satisfied and content. According to James Plath, a critic of Movie Metropolis, `A screenplay with enough substance to hold our attention, even when the storyline lapses into familiar territory.'

Characters and Actors

 Herman Boone, played by Denzel Washington, is no doubt a tough man. He is relentless and determined, particularly in his goal to form a `united front'. Often times, he appears overbearing. Yet, we rarely see a softer side of Boone as he is always portrayed as the strong, determined leader. He does have his moments however when he breaks down his walls. In particular, when he yields to Yoast's game plan, in effect, surrendering his pride. Denzel Washington's acting is, as expected, great. Revered as one of the best African American actors, and perhaps one of the best actors, Washington personifies Herman Boone well. He made his character believable and likeable, despite his sometimes aloof manner.
 Bill Yoast, played by Will Patton, was the head coach before Boone came along. Initially, he receives Boone with resistance, both his methods and perhaps his color. However, as the movie develops, Patton gives the audience a spectacular performance. Patton's character, Yoast develops as the movie proceeds. While he wasn't necessarily racist in the beginning, Yoast began to change his views on blacks as the movie proceeded. He begins to see what the blacks experience and he was able to empathize, allowing his character to flourish and develop.
 Gerry Bertier, played by Ryan Hurst, is portrayed as the typical cookie cutter white southerner. He's clean cut and the captain of the football team. Initially, he is depicted as one of the most unlikeable characters. However, as the movie the progresses, Bertier's character transforms into one that everyone loves. Most notably, his relationship with Julius Campbell becomes the most meaningful of the movie as they come to define the true definition of friendship. In his understanding of the blacks, Bertier begins to stand up for them, in some cases, pushing away his white friends for what he believes is right. Hurst brings life to a character that could otherwise be defined as a clich and makes his character's relationship with Julius a memorable one. According to critic John R. McEwen, of Film Quips Online, Remember the Titans is `A moving story with nice work from young actors Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst, among others, as the young men forced to see beyond skin color.'

Historical Accuracy

 While the film appeals to many for its dramatic and inspiring qualities, some of the facts have been exaggerated. For many, the film gives off the impression that 1971 was the first year schools in Virginia were integrated. However, it was 8 years ago in 1963 that schools in Virginia were forced to combine both black and white communities. To many, the racial tension is greatly exaggerated. According to Mary Blanton, a former student at TC Williams High School during those years, the film inaccurately portrayed the racial tension, dramatically exaggerating the circumstances.
 Furthermore, in an attempt to emphasize the message of racial understanding, the movie inaccurately portrayed perhaps one of the most important events within the movie, boot camp. In Remember the Titans, boot camp was depicted as a turning point, a point where everyone came to accept race and come together as a team. However, in reality, tension existed not because of racial tension, but because of competition to obtain a coveted spot on the team.
 Moreover, an event that came to define Boone and Yoast's relationship did not even occur. In reality, Sheryl Yoast never visited Boone's house. Moreover, according to Boone, it was not a brick that came crashing through the window, `It was something far more devastating to any human being than a brick could be. I guess Disney, being the family movie production company that it is, felt that to depict a toilet stool coming through your window was a bit much ... I've never gotten over that incident that particular night, because I could never understand how anybody could feel so bad about another human being as to throw a toilet commode through a window.' In addition, the run to Gettysburg at 3 a.m. did not even happen. To add drama, the movie directors invented this scene where Boone takes the team to the infamous battleground, only to give an inspirational speech that evokes a turnaround in the team. While the team did go to the Gettysburg battleground, it was the tour guide that did most of the talking and not Boone.
 Furthermore, in an attempt to further add drama the movie, directors and screenwriters exaggerated the team's game records. In Remember the Titans, the Titans were shown trailing their opponents by 7 points in the Championship game. However, when in reality, the score line showed a lopsided victory where the Titans won 27-0. Additionally, the movie inaccurately portrayed the Titans as the underdogs, when in reality; they dominated most of the teams they played, rising to the 2nd ranked team in the country. `There were more than a few times that I felt genuinely sorry for the teams we played,"" Charles Mitchell, a backup running back, recalls ""We would have won the state championship without the coaches, in my opinion. We were that dominating.' To further add to the underdog appeal of the Titans, directors portrayed them as the only integrated team. As stated in the movie, ""Like all the other schools in this conference, they're all white. They don't have to worry about race. We do."" While in reality, all the teams they faced were integrated.
 Moreover, in the movie, Gerry Bertier was injured before the Championship game, where he watched bedside in frustration as his team trailed. However, in reality, he played in the championship game, only to be injured months after their dream season ended.
 While many changes were made from the original story to make the movie more interesting and to fit the emotional needs of the audience, there are historical accuracies intertwined within the script. The boycotts against Boone and the protests against black students were all too real, as were the initial resistance Boone received.

 While Remember the Titans is a movie dotted with inaccuracies, truth is intertwined within the script to produce a fulfilling and emotional story. For those who want a satisfying and dramatic retelling of the events that occurred in Alexandria, this would be the perfect movie; but for those who want hard facts, one would be better off looking somewhere else.",1354665600,,8920,5.051665533650578

Yost has had 15 winning seasons and has been nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame and people just can't believe that he has been replaced. Coach Boone steps into a hotbed of hatred and racial tension as the team is newly integrated with both black and white players and the tensions are high.

Coach Boone asks Yost to be the assistant coach and at first he refuses but he sees the racial tension between the black and white players and Coach Boone and he agrees as the white players will refuse to play unless he participates with the team. Football camp is bad because the tempers flare and many conflicts take place over racial tension. Slowly the team begins to reach some sense of teamwork and they begin to gel into a good team.

1402635,1,B000056VP3,"Occidental Observer says:
Perhaps more than any other Hollywood movie, Remember the Titans (2000) reveals the template for the planned replacement of the American majority.
 Ostensibly a heart-warming tale about a group of high school football players working to overcome racism in turbulent times, the barely buried subtext is that Whites should gladly -- altruistically (see this fantastic review of ""pathological altruism"") -- hand over everything that they value to Blacks.
The football team represents American society in microcosm, Black, White, and tense.
Subtlety is not this film's forte.
A particularly egregious co-optation of a Christian theme, I felt, comes when quarterback Gary is driving his '69 Chevy Camaro through town after another Titans' victory.

His car is broadsided by an old pickup truck, and he is permanently paralyzed from the waist down. In the hospital, Gary watches on TV as his team fights its way to victory in the Virginia State Championship. Jewish director Yakin sets up a shot where White light from above shines over the prostrate Gary, who then lifts his arms in a Christ-like pose.

He has given everything so that his Black teammates may play. No opportunity is missed to show that the world is a better place when Blacks replace Whites. The lesson for American society in general is clear.

I suppose it is painful for any racially aware White to view, let alone teach, such replacement-theme films. My conflict, however, comes with each new year proving me so right.",1342224000,2,1511,5.130081300813008

1402650,4,B000056VP3,"Movies that stimulate, inspire, and deeply move the viewer on several emotional layers are forever a part of cinematic lore.  And REMEMBER THE TITANS is a member of this prestigious group, capturing the tension and drama--and outright ugliness--of a high school, and in particular, its football team, during the first year of integration.  Based (albeit loosely) on the 1971 season of the T.C. Williams Titans, this is a high octane, ultimately feel good thriller running a full gambit of emotions from the perspectives of the African-American and white players--from distrust, to anger, to acceptance, to camaraderie.  And as a metaphorical microcosm, these emotions are amplified in the relationship between new head coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) and former head coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton).  The chemistry between the two actors is mesmerizing, as Coach Patton comes to grips with being replaced as head coach, while Coach Boone, a rigid disciplinarian, has to deal with the racism that permeates the culture of 1971 Virginia.

The summer boot camp, the practices, the confrontations (players and coaches), and the games are believable and heart-pounding; there is heartache, even tragedy, yet the Titans overcome considerable odds to post an unbeaten regular season, with the exclamation point firmly placed at the end of the game for the state championship.  One star off for the somewhat sanitized depiction of racism (this is Disney, of course), yet with each viewing of REMEMBER THE TITANS you'll find yourself cheering from your seat.  This film is a Hail Mary pass that scores.

1402651,5,B000056VP3,"To this day, Remember The Titans is still one of the most popular films concerning racial tensions between blacks and whites in America - it has good reason to be so. Even though not all events in the movie are real, the film accurately reflects on the ""feeling"" truth to the segregated society blacks and whites faced during the 1970s. The film overcomes racism by using captivating camera angles and music to evoke more of an emotional response from the audience. Remember The Titans is about America's goal in attaining racial harmony and the price people have to pay in order to do so.

The struggle of being black in such a radical time is reflected on one of the first scenes in the movie. T.C. Williams High School was one of the schools that were forced to integrate and because of the integration of the three American public high schools, black coach Herman Boone was to replace white coach Bill Yoast at T.C. Williams. Due to the strong racial tensions in Virginia, coach Boone recognizes the unspoken racial rules that he will be breaking, but also acknowledges the respect that he will be bringing to the black community in Virginia. Yoast is extremely hesitant under Boone and this clearly establishes the relationship between the two races. From his hesitancy, we see the whites still see themselves as superior. Despite all the criticism coach Boone receives from whites, he responds professionally - and vows to blind himself from skin color and treat all football players the same.

Right before the school year starts, pre-season football camp begins. Black and white players are extremely suspicious and distrustful of each other and even when they get on the two buses, separate by race. Coach Boone sees this and orders the team to sit by what position they play on the field, either defense or offense. By doing this, Boone quickly establishes himself as a disciplinarian. He refuses to be viewed as inferior - yet, he is fair when he deals with both black and white players. He forces the team to get to know each other - demanding that until they do, they will have to practice rigorously three times a day. When the players realize there is no way out, Alan, one of the white players and Petey, a black player, ""get to know each other"". In this scene, Petey and Alan are sitting on opposite sides - facing each other as if they were enemies. Right in between them is a path running between up the Building of Gettysburg College - this metaphorically resembles the slave-ownership times and how it still reflec ts on the tensions between black and white today. The scene continues on with Alan asking Petey, ""What's your daddy's name? Wait. You do have a daddy, right? ... What's he do? Wait. He does have a job, right?"" Alan's questions reflect on the misconceptions whites have on blacks - that most black men are unemployed and aren't around for the family. This scene is especially important because it allows the audience to realize the huge racial gap.

Camp goes on, and even during practice, heavy racial tensions unravel. White players refuse to help defend the black players, which in turn pushes the black players to do the same. This leads to a confrontation between black player Julius Campbell and white captain Gerry Bertier. Bertier complains that Julius only plays for himself, and Julius responds, ""Nobody plays. Yourself included. I'm supposed to wear myself out for the team? What team? Nah, nah what I'm gonna do is look out for myself and I'ma get mine. ... Attitude reflects leadership, captain"". The scene eminently displays the distrust both races have for each other. It also evokes emotion in the audience - it is clear both players want to play their best, but the only thing stopping them is their skin color.
In reality, this confrontation never happened. Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell had always been good friends - and maintained that friendship up until Bertier's death in 1990. The film dramatizes racial barrier by showing the two boys as enemies before they became best friends.

One night during camp, Coach Boone wakes the whole team up at three in the morning to go for a run. This is one of the most important scenes in the movie, as it significantly alters the relationships between the black and white players. When they arrive at Gettysburg cemetery, coach Boone gives one of the most powerful speeches in the movie,
""This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg. Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fighting the same fight that we are still fighting among ourselves today. This green field right here, painted red, bubblin' with the blood of young boys. Smoke and hot lead pouring right through their bodies. Listen to their souls, men. I killed my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family. You listen, and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed, just like they were. I don't care if you like each other of not, but you will respect each other. And maybe... I don't know, maybe we'll learn to play this game like men"".
The camera is shot through a high angle in this scene - painting Coach Boone as more superior, which adds more strength to his speech. The Titans Theme music also draws weight to the decisions the players have to make; they either start working together as a team or they fall apart. The next day, the team begins cooperating - defending one another and even in the locker rooms, a clear bond begins to forge.
In reality though, the team never ran up to Gettysburg cemetery at three in the morning. Coach Boone did not give an inspirational speech quite like that one - this scene was inserted to represent the beginning of the overcoming of racial tensions between the team.

In the movie, there were still some players who are unhappy about the segregation. Ray, one of the white football players, refuse to work together as a team and constantly allowed his black players to get hurt. Team captain Gerry Bertier sees this and convinces Coach Boone to kick him off the team. Despite Boone's rule to never kick anyone off, he makes an exception - Bertier's concern represents a huge step towards racial harmony; he is no longer limited by skin color and sees beyond that with his teammates. In reality, no one was ever kicked off the team. Ray was a fictionalized character - the scene was added to the movie to display the united front the team faced together.

The film also emphasizes a lot of attitudes and beliefs white people had. This is indicated when the team returns from football camp. Unlike the past couple of weeks, the racial hatred in Alexandria is much more intense - demonstrated through the protests of desegregation outside of T.C. Williams High. The whites are still very bitter towards the segregation. In one instance, Bertier introduces his white girlfriend Emma to Julius- and when Campbell offers his hand, she refuses to shake it. This did not actually happen in real life, as Emma was also a completely fictionalized character. The titans website addressed this and said, ""Emma is, at best, a composite of bad traits of a lot of people"". This scene was only added to emphasize the superiority the whites felt. (put sentence in beginning and add, so reader knows why you're giving example)

There are also many made up scenes to make the movie more interesting. This allows the audience to become more empathetic towards the players. For instance, right before the first game, Coach Boone is told that if he loses even one game, he would be fired. Under intense pressure, Boone works his players fiercely - and even before the first game, vomits due to stress. But because of his drive, the Titans win every game - and while doing so, gaining more support from the community. Right before the state championships though, members of the school board rigged the game in wanting for Boone to get fired. Coach Yoast realizes what they have done and threatens the referee. The referees yield - which results in Coach Yoast losing the potential position in the Hall of Fame. This scene is vital to the movie - the Hall of Fame is one of the most prestigious awards you can receive in the community. Yet, Coach Yoast is willing to sacrifice this award for the better good. It is clear here that Coach Yoast has stepped over a barrier many in the town are refusing to do. In reality, this did not actually happen. This scene was put in to represent the unity of Coach Yoast and Coach Boone. It is also here that we see the diversity of roles the actors can play. At the beginning of the movie, Coach Boone is portrayed as a disciplinarian, very self-controlled and composure. In this scene, Coach Boone loses a bit of his coolness, succumbing to his anger when he thinks the referee is intentionally making bad calls. Tough movie reviewer James Beradinelli agrees. Even though he doesn't particular like the movie, he says about Denzel Washington (Coach Boone), ""And, even though nearly every individual is pretty much a cut-and-dried type, those whom we get to know on a first-name basis are likable. Of course, the presence of an accomplished actor like Washington doesn't hurt, nor does the fact that some attention is paid to giving his character depth and complexity"". Not only did the actors do a good job, but the music also represented the tone of the movie well.
The popular tune, ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" in the film represented the break of the barrier. On the bus ride to the camp, one of the black players begin singing before another player tells him to shut up. Later on when the two racial groups come together as a team in the locker rooms, the song is blasted on full volume, with both races singing along. This represents the cooperative team spirit they finally attain.
Another important song in the movie is the 1960's song, ""Na, na, na, na/ na, na, na, na/ Hey Hey Hey/ Goodbye"". The song is played throughout the film in different tones in representing the mood of the scene. When the team returns from football camp, they're all singing the song in the original tune. In that certain scene, they're saying goodbye to the racial tensions that they were able to break and were finally able to come together as a team and celebrate. The second time we hear this song is when the Titans win their first game, and similar to the first time they sing it, it's a celebration of the team's coming together. The last time we hear the song is at the end of the film when the team comes together for the final time to mourn for Gerry Bertier's death. Julius, who eventually becomes Bertier's best friend, begins humming in a grieving tone. It is sung with pain, yet through pain comes unification.

Remember The Titans was not all that perfect though. There was controversy that the film was not actually all about race - since the three schools integrated, there was a much larger gene pool of talent, which could have been the reason why the players didn't get along during training camp.  An English teacher at T.C. Williams said kids ""adjusted pretty well to (the integrated) situation. The kids behaved a whole lot better than most of the adults"".  Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard disagrees. He says, ""Yeah right. Who wants to say `I hated (black people)?' Who wants to say, `I hated white people?' Who wants to say, `We hated each other?'"" Not only was there controversy, but some movie critics believe the film played ""safe"". New York Times Review sarcastically adds, ""Before it's all over, there are only good people, although they retain their original color. Given the film's general tone, it's a wonder Washington doesn't convince everyone to turn beige"". Since the movie was targeted for a younger audience, the critique the movie received was rough. Remember The Titans generally received good reviews, and manages to avoid clich&eacute;s while attaining to its original message.

Although Remember The Titans was extremely dramatized, it had some truth to it. Like Tim O'Brien said,  ""Stories are to console and to inspire and to help us heal. Stories are for those late hours in the night when you can't remember how you got from where you were to where you are"". It is only through movies like this are we able to move forward - to talk about the big elephant in the room and to understand the true meaning of why we are the way we are. Remember The Titans is not about winning or losing the games. When we cheer for the victories of the Titans, we are not cheering for the points on the scoreboard. We are cheering for a defeat of overcoming racism, every single time.",1332892800,,12638,4.708408679927667

Remember the Titans
Jackson Rudd

 Remember the Titans is a movie that tells the story of the TC Williams Titans, a high school football team from Alexandria Virginia in 1971. It is an emotional and uplifting story in which first-year head coach Herman Boone brings the racially agitated town together through his coaching methods and belief in racial equality. Although the overall message of what happened that year is true, the film itself is not historically accurate.
 According to insiders there was tension between the players both on and off the football field but more so due to the intense competition for a spot on the team rather than racial issues. Former students from T.C. Williams have stated that most of the racial problems had been resolved by 1971. Former quarterback Ronnie ""Sunshine"" Bass said, ""They (the movie) had a community divided down black and white and it really wasn't like that in 1971 Alexandria."" Patrick Welsh, a friend of Bill Yoast, spoke on the historical accuracy of the film in a Washington Post article. ""My friend, Bill Yoast told me Disney has taken liberties with the facts, suggesting an overheated atmosphere of racial animosities and fears at the school and in the community that just hadn't existed."" Obviously there was some racial tension in Alexandria at that time but Disney spun a lot of the history in order to make the movie more interesting and intense.
  Most of the events in the movie that have to do with coach Boone and the football team did take place.  The team did do a week long camp at Gettysburg College and often practiced three times in one day, which is accurately depicted in the film. In the movie, coach Boone integrated the busses before the team even left for camp, which is also historically accurate. Coach Boone said, "" I forced them on each other. I forced them to learn each other's culture. I forced them to be a part of each other's lives."" However, the scene in which coach Boone wakes the team up at 3 a.m. and makes them run to the Gettysburg Cemetery did not really happen but the team did tour the battlefields while they were at camp.
 Certain characters in the movie were completely made up for dramatic effect. Emma Hoyt, player Gerry Bertier's girlfriend, is purely fictional; made up solely for the purpose of helping the viewers to further understand some of the racial ignorance that existed among the students of T.C. Williams. Football player Alan Bosley, played by Ryan Gosling, is fictional and the scene where he gives up his spot to Pete was put into the film to depict the relationships and selflessness that had been accomplished by the players. Ray Budds, the player who gets kicked off the team by the team captain Gerry Bertier is also fictionalized. Players like that would not have even been allowed on the team to begin with. All of this aside, a majority of the Titans football players shown in the movie are real, fact based characters.
 The film did not fully depict the level of racism against coach Herman Boone. The director edited a lot of what was said and done to Boone during the season due to the fact that it was a Disney film.  For example, the scene in which a brick is thrown through Boone's window is not accurate because it was not a brick that was thrown. It was a toilet. Boone said, ""There wasn't a brick thrown through my window. It was something far more devastating to any human being than a brick could be. I've never gotten over that incident that particular night, because I could never understand how anybody could feel so bad about another human being as to throw a toilet commode through a window."" In this particular situation, instead of adding events to make the movie more dramatic, real events were taken out to soften the harsh realities that existed.
 The T.C. Williams Titans were 13-0 and ranked second in the nation at the close of the 1971 season. Unlike the movie, in very few games was the score even close and the championship game was a complete blowout. Despite the fact that certain events were added and cut from the movie, it proved to be a very inspiring film in which the walls of racial tension were broken down and common ground was found. This film has served as an example for the way that Americans and all people should act toward one another and the way that we should all live our lives.",1332892800,,4367,4.652399481193256

""People say that it can't work, black and white; well here we make it work,
everyday. We have our disagreements, of course, but before we reach for
hate, always, always, we remember the Titans.""

The movie we all fall in love with, Remember the Titans is a
heartfelt movie that excites the audience but unfortunately inaccurate in
terms of the history as it is based from a true story.

Directed by Boaz Yakin and written by Gregory Allen Howard,
Remember the Titans is a fervent movie about the true events that
happened in Alexandria Virginia. In 1971, when the tensions were high
between the whites and blacks especially during the civil rights movement,
two suburban Virginia schools were forced to integrate after years of
segregation. Thus one black and one white school formed T.C Williams
High School. In Virginia, football was a huge craze, everyone enjoyed it
and everyone respected it. The well-known and honorable Caucasian head
coach (Will Patton starring as Coach Bill Yoast) of the Titans football team
was replaced by an African American coach (Denzel Washington as Coach
Herman Boone). This sparked more riots as players of different race were
forced to play together on the same football team. Soon enough, the Titans
learned to cooperate after they attended the two-week training camp held
in Gettysburg. Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst),
Petey Jones (Donald Faison), Rev Harris (Craig Kirkwood) are a few of the
Titans that experienced the hardships as they were new to the situation
they were placed in. When the newly united Titans returned back to their
hometown, the players found the city in mayhem as the school year had
just started, and it meant the blacks and whites had to finally face each
other. But as the school year progressed and the Titans were unstoppable
due to their collaboration as a team, the community started to accept the
new changes. After the Titans' perfect season together, the town reached
new heights in achieving more racial equality.

Surprisingly, the performances of the actors in this movie did
an absolutely fantastic job. It's hard enough to act the roles they pursued
but the actors really got into character. The emotion they tried to convey
felt real and tenacious. But aside from the fact that this movie was well
produced; the zest that was missing from the whole film was the historical
accuracy as it lacked the whole truth. Because it was a Disney movie
directed to all audiences including children, the historical accuracy was
twisted in a sense to make the moralities more obvious. Although some
events in the story were true, like the integration of the buses and the

football camp, many of the events that were shown in the book were not
depicted correctly or didn't happened at all. For instance, Gerry Bertier
never had a girlfriend (Kate Bosworth as Emma Hoyt) in real life but she
was made up as a character in the movie to demonstrate some of the
negative traits and beliefs that the youth had during those days. Another
example of historical inaccuracy would be the racial tension in the
community. Racial tension did exist in Alexandria but the racial tension
was made extremely intense in the movie. The reason for this was because
Disney wanted to show their audience the atmosphere back then and
wanted more drama. The racial incident in the restaurant did not actually
happen but it was added into the film to portray the attitude of white
restaurants in America at the time to make a greater emphasis.
What did not happen as well was the brick being thrown through Coach
Boone's window. In reality, it was much worse. It was a toilet commode.
The reason why this wasn't shown was because as stated before of how
Disney is a family orientated production company and does not allow
such hostility and embarrassment to be shown in a movie. Disney felt that
showing a toilet stool thrown through a window was too much and that
it wouldn't be right. Another event that was not correct in the movie was
the part of the referees cheating with the calls as they were being bias and
made unfair rulings towards the Titans. The threat that Coach Yoast made
towards the referees also never happened as well.

Because Remember the Titans is not as accurate as it could be,
the underlying message was warped. Instead of telling us that the racial
tensions were not as obvious and intense, Remember the Titans pushed it
to the extreme. It was a heartfelt movie that we all wanted to connect to, a
movie that we all wanted to watch again as it inspires us to be something
greater. It was riveting and a wonderful story that should be told to
everyone, but the question is should the movie story be replaced by the
actual facts? Should Disney remake the movie with the whole truth?",1332806400,2,4791,4.787182587666264
1402654,5,B000056VP3,"The tagline `based on a true story' often deceives the audience in believing that the plot is entirely real. What is realized after the movie is that the truth was immensely dramatized and exaggerated. Not so much was different for the film `Remember the Titans'. But what was different about this film compared to others was that behind the fake accounts lied an honest message and lesson learnt from the event.
  Directed by Boaz Yakin, the film `Remember the Titans' is set in 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia, where the Supreme Court recently ruled the integration of public schools. One all black and one all white high schools are forced to join with T.C. Williams High School. Adding onto the existing racial tension, the board decides to replace the respected white football coach, Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), with a black football coach, Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington). Not only does the enmity remain amongst the coaches, the student athletes also fight amongst each other to secure a spot in the team, with majority of the hatred arising from racial differences. To build teamwork, Boone initiates a 2-week intensive football training camp where he forces the students to get to know each other. Two kids, Julius Campbell, (played by Wood Harris) and Gerry Bertier (played by Ryan Hurst) have the most trouble coming together and end up creating multiple fights. Overtime, the differences are overcome and the Titans become a unifying force in Alexandria. At the end of the movie, the Titans win the Virginia state championship, succeeding to bring the whole community together.
  Though the movie brings a powerful message, it is not historically accurate. Disney had publically announced that many part of the movie was altered or made up to leave a greater impact. First of all, the racial tensions in the movie were highly exaggerated. Unlike told in the movie, the schools in Alexandria were forced to integrate in the fall of 1965. It was in 1971 that the schools were forced to join T.C. Williams High School because of the increasing pressure from the federal government. But by then, civilians were adjusted to integration. According to Mary Blanton, an attorney who attended T.C. Williams, ""the movie depicts Alexandria as a Hollywood-stereotypical Southern town, circa 1950s. But by the late `60s and early `70s, Alexandria was a cosmopolitan bedroom community for the rapidly expanding federal establishment..."" In the movie, the town is split into a black neighborhood and a white neighborhood. That was not the case in Alexandria. The Titan's game records were dramatized as well. In the movie, the Titans were against the Marshall for the state championship, overriding the score only at the last minute. In reality, the Titans went against Andrew Lewis at the State Championship and were winning the entire game. In the film, Bertier gets paralyzed right before the championship game, throwing the team into deep trouble. However in reality, Bertier was injured months after the Titans won championship game.
  Even though many accounts of the movie are fictional, the movie gets critical acclaim. The fictional elements and the dramatization is what leave a greater impact and clearer grasp of the situation. Sure, people may not understand the detail as much but for that isn't the most important aspect of this film. What the audiences learn from watching this movie is the understanding of the experience: the characters' sentiments and their motives for action. The actors, Denzel Washington and Will Patton, for one, succeed in connecting with the audience in a more personal level by exposing their emotions to the movie. The director chooses to shoot a lot of close up shots to show shift in mood of the characters. This conveys a clear message that the children in Alexandria were able to overlook the differences in races and become like a family. Also, the close ups make the audience feel that they know the characters personally. The music in this movie also is a powerful tool. The musical directior, Trevor Rabin has chosen all music to fit the scene and heighten the audience's emotional experience. In many ways, the lyrics of all the songs were relate to the plot. In one scene, all black and white students are seen singing Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" to insinuate that the Titans can overcome all the obstacles.
  An author that also dramatizes real events to leave greater impact is Tim O'Brien in The Things They Carried. Tim O'Brien publicly stated in an interview that most of his short stories were fictional. Though it was true that he was a veteran in the Vietnam War, he fictionalizes his stories to put the readers in a veteran's shoes. In the short story, Speaking of Courage, O'Brien constantly refers back to the character, Norman Bowker driving around a lake for hours and hours. This action, actually, never happened. Though not legitimate, this fictional description helps emphasize the madness of the Vietnam War. The protagonist was shown driving mindlessly because he could never forget his barbaric actions during the war; his mind couldn't escape the circuit of guilt and horror. What was most exceptional about this novel was that at the end, the novel was not truly about the Vietnam War. It was about how the author changed throughout the war.
  The producer of the film, Jerry Bruckheimer said, ""This isn't a slick Hollywood project, - we put out something very real and that's what we wanted to do."" I definitely would suggest people to view this film because, as Jerry Bruckheimer said, the story is essentially honest. The Titans did have to go through the emotional turmoil in trying to stick together when the rest of America was telling them not to. Overtime, the story itself may be lost but the message will still stay strong within the viewers' minds.",1332806400,,5865,4.993858751279427

Though made to make a heart-warming and inspirational story for the audience to watch, the reality of the story has been twisted and distorts the history of this event.

Gregory A. Howard wrote the original screenplay of Remember the Titans in the late 1990s. It is based on the true story of T.C. Williams High School located in Alexandria, Virginia. Though it is based on the historical story of this integrated school, a great amount of the film is fictionalized and has some inaccuracies. Even so, this film managed to capture the interest and love of many through the exaggerated drama, music and characters.

The story begins in 1971 with the merging of a black and a white school to form the T.C Williams high school. When this happened, racial tension heightened among the citizens of Alexandria and many problems arose. However, the players on the team were more concerned with having a spot on the team.

With the combination of the schools, Caucasian football coach Bill Yoast was forced to step down as head coach and take the position of assistant coach so that Herman Boone, an African American man could step in. While the football players disagreed for a while on this matter, the coaches were able to step up and work together well to secure the success for their team. They were able to end the prejudice and hate between the members and bring them together to win the Virginia State Championship. T.C. Williams became a role model for all those still struggling with the desegregation in high schools.

When comparing how the film portrayed this scene to the true story, you can see that it is slightly different than what actually happened. In reality, after the Supreme Court ruled that all school systems were to be desegregated in 1963, schools in Alexandria created the K6-2-2-2 plan in order to achieve official desegregation. This created two junior high schools, George Washington and Francis Hammond and one high school, T.C. Williams High School. When this caused heightened tension, and extremely high competition in football, the school board in Virginia chose to combine the 3 schools to resolve these issues.

Other historical inaccuracies like the one above appeared through out the film. For example, the director also chose to exaggerate the scores in the games. In the film they showed the titans trailing the Marshall team by seven points, when they actually beat Andrew Lewis 27 points to zero. It can be assumed that for the purpose of winning the audiences support of the Titans, they portrayed the Titans as the underdog in the beginning. This enables the movie to build up the storyline and have a more dramatic ending that satisfies the needs of the viewers.

American football player Gerry Bertier was also shown to have sustained a major injury before the championship game, when it actually was not until months after the game. In the film, due to his injury and hospitalization, he was incapable of playing. Methods like this also win the hearts of the audience and allow the characters to gain their sympathy.

Beyond the differences between what actually happened and what didn't, the music and acting played a key role in making scenes more dramatic. In the locker room, when two of the players discovered their common interest of music it evoked great emotion. They seemed like they had always been friends when singing Ain't No Mountain High Enough. It created a strong sense of happiness, and the appropriate lyrics relates directly to the central issue of segregation. The films ability to embed emotions was quite good. Along with the music, certain motions like the dancing also enforced the sense of unity and what it meant to be a single team. The film's ability to go from chaos and anger to togetherness was very strong and inspirational.

In conclusion, the film was able to add drama and intensify the emotions of the audience greatly by the use of music, acting and how they portrayed certain things. By the end of the movie the audience's desire for the Titans to be victorious is also very high and succeeded in passing the message of racial equality. However, while Remember the Titans was an enthralling film to watch, the historical inaccuracies and dramatization has shifted the history of the titans greatly.",1332720000,,4291,4.8994490358126725
1402656,5,B000056VP3,"Tell the truth, but tell it slant. In media nowadays, it seems that there's always a bend in the definitive straight truth. Fiction based on true stories is always at least slightly tweaked more than the truth. For creative purposes, producers and directors add or subtract elements to add flair to the movie or show. In Remember the Titans, this also occurred but produced a truly feel-good inspirational film.

A new football season is starting with the tryouts before school starts in T.C. Williams in Alexandria, Virginia in the year 1971. The head coaching position is taken from Coach Yoast and given to Coach Boone in order to integrate and Coach Boone offers Yoast the spot. He eventually takes it after disputes with his assistant. Over the summer camp, the team integrates to overcome racial differences and previously deep-set discrimination from traditions in the South, to come together and inspire themselves, the coaches, and the town striving for the end goal of a state championship, which they win.

The performances by the entire cast and the production of the film were high quality. The plot makes the viewer naturally attracted and support the protagonist of those who are fighting the racism and trying to attain the good. There are many feel good moments such as when the team's winning streak and football clips of their destruction of other teams are shown.

However, the truth is stretched many times in order to secure those superior feelings that make you laugh, smile, and cry. Alan Bosley was a fictional character put in the movie to emphasize the kindness and selflessness of the players when he gave up his position. The team did go to Gettysburg College for the summer camp but the 3 A.M. run that the coaches took them on to the cemetery did not occur. Instead, they visited the cemetery on a Sunday afternoon and the tour guide, not Coach Boone, gave the talks. The speech that Coach Boone gave added to the dramatic dynamics and inspired the boys to overcome the racial challenges as thousands of men their age had died for the freedoms they were living. Julius Campbell and Gerry Bertier were good friends just as other players were but not as close as the movie had depicted. The producers chose to focus in on their relationship as it provided an example of the successful integration and that they could overcome together. It was definitely a warming scene when Gerry and Julius broke up the fight in the school of each of their respective races. Emma Hoyt, Gerry's girlfriend, was a fictional character that was meant to represent the negative view that some of the youth had been raised with. By 1971, T.C. Williams was already integrated so the protestors outside the school didn't happen in 1971 but may have happened in its first day in 1965. All the other schools in the conference were also all integrated by then so T.C. Williams were not the pioneers that the movie had depicted. There was never a plot by the referees to make sure the Titans lost the game in which Coach Yoast threatened to reveal showing his conscience choosing the good moral side. In 1971, there was no Virginia School Hall of Fame in which Coach Yoast did not make. A brick was never thrown through the window but instead, a toiletry was. The brick was more menacing than the toiletry and the producers decided that would be better. Coach Boone also never went for his gun after it came through his window. In fact, Boone never owned a gun. The Titans never danced and sang as they warmed up but yet again, it was a touching moment to see them in happiness and joy together.",1332633600,,3597,4.724522292993631

The story is set in the seventies a midst a heavily segregated community.

All you need is teamwork and respect for one another to be a great team.  Denzel Washington (African American) and Will Patton (White), coach an integrated football team.  The team at first has trouble getting along with each other.  But, after Head Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), delivers an inspirational speech at the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, they respect each other and work as a team.  Julius Campbell, played by Wood Harris, and Gerry Bertier, played by Ryan Hurst, at first do not get along with each other, but they become the leaders of the team.
 This movie is based on a true story.  It is rated PG and the age range is everybody.  This movie is 1 hour and 53 minutes long but every second of the movie is worth it.  Denzel Washington brings out the best of his character.  All of the actors play their parts perfectly.  This movie shows us that we need to respect each other no matter who we are or what our skin color is and that teamwork prevails.  This is an overall great movie for all ages.
There are inspirational points in the movies, where the Titans persevere.  During one of their games, the other team's coach bribed the referees to call an unfair game.  When the assistant coach, Bill Yoast (Will Patton), realizes what was happening, he gives a motivating speech to the players which leads to the victory.

You fumble the football, and you will run a mile. Now let's go to work."" This is a quote from one, of many, inspirational speeches by Coach Herman Boone about the game of football in the dramatic film, Remember the Titans. The movie Remember the Titans is a feel good and inspirational movie of the harsh truth in the later 1900s. This movie is filled with obstacles between a football team, the bond they created, and there desire to work as one for their single goal of winning a championship. As an audience member this movie will make you watch it over and over again as it is truly worth the money.
 In the movie Remember the Titans, obstacles overwhelm the football team of T.C. Williams High School. Based on a true story, the high school has many difficulties to overcome in order to be successful. For starters, an obvious obstacle in this story is that a new football coach is hired for the football team. Now in modern day, this seems to be no issue, but the setting is the 1970s and T.C. Williams is becoming an inter-racial school. The coach being hired is African-American, and the old coach, a white man, is demoted to defensive coordinator. Also, the players of the team are split and do not like to interact due to racial hatred at each other's groups. The football team now must find a way to overcome these difficult issues to have a successful year. It won't be an easy road as their team goes against the rest of society, and they must learn to adjust. To over come this adversity the team must bond as one instead of split as two.
 With hatred brewing new head football coach, Herman Boone, decides a plan must be made in order to have a successful football team at T.C. Williams. To start off his plan, coach Herman Boone gathers the football players for training camp. Right before departure, all the white players go on one bus, and all the African-Americans on another. Coach immediately discovers this situation and orders everyone off the buses. He then splits the players according to offense and defense, which mixes the races. With Coach Boone satisfied, the team sets off for training camp. At training camp, Coach Boone makes players learn about another person of a different race in order to form a team bond. Players spend time with one another and find similar likings. This leads to more teamwork on the field, instead of everyone playing for themselves. Another act Coach Boone does, is he makes players bunk with a player of a different race to see how they are more a like then different. The players learn to like each other, and find more success in their practices when they play to one another's strengths and work as one. The bond that Coach Boone created with the team helps T.C. Williams have a better chance at their ultimate goal in winning a championship.
 Ever since becoming the head coach, Herman Boone had a goal on winning the state championship. After he got his team to play as one, Coach Herman Boone knew that winning the title was definitely possible. He had players moved around for the better of the team. He even stuck to the same game plan during the season, and stressed game in and game out that heart is how you play the game of football. He strived to be perfect in every aspect of the game, and would not tolerate any thing that would hurt the team. This strategy ultimately allowed T.C. Williams to keep on winning during the season. Low and behold with heart and talent Coach Herman Boone found his team in the championship game. The Coach over came integrity and racial boundaries to get to this point. Absolutely nothing was going to stand in this team's desire to win the championship. With their minds focused and their hearts set on the title, T.C. Williams won the crown and were the state champs! It was a well-deserved title for a team that inspired all.
 The movie Remember the Titans has a lot of heart and teamwork that proves worthy in the end. Without the actions of the Coach Herman Boone, T.C. Williams would have never won the championship. This is a story that has inspired me to never give up. It is a movie of both struggle and success. It will keep you asking for more. The movie Remember the Titans is by far the best production that I have ever watched in my entire life.",1319328000,,4402,4.512531328320802

1402709,5,B000056VP3,"I know there are a lot of football films out there, as well as movies about race relations in the Civil Rights Era, but ""Remember the Titans"" has got to be one of the best films in these genres! It is a movie that older children and adults can all enjoy, and perhaps younger children can too if they can handle seeing a boy injured from a car accident.

Some people criticize this movie as being predictable, because you know many Caucasian and African American characters are eventually going to get along. However, there's more to it than that. For one, Bertier gets into that car accident which renders him paralyzed from the waist down. The movie shows all kinds of prejudices and violence, but doesn't forget to show that there are more issues, like such an accident, for people to worry about. In addition, I like that they include a ""hippie"" character from California who isn't afraid to be different.

And for those of you that still have a problem with the movie being somewhat predictable, so what? It is still a wonderful film. The acting is well done, as you see that none of the characters are perfect, and that makes them all the more human.

Sports films like this one, Remember the Titans, make us feel good about life and sometimes competition. Titans certainly has a unique way of repeating this particular formula. The film is set in the early 70's when black and white are still divided. Here, it's about unity and respecting each other despite our differences. Even though it isn't entirely accurate, the true story is told extremely well, with a couple of exceptions. First off, I will say that Sheryl Yoast (played by Hayden Panettiere) really bugged me whenver she was onscreen. Her energetic, as well as sweet, personality made me cringe. And some of the dialogue a bit too overdone and preachy. But despite the annoying little girl and the preachy dialogue, Remember the Titans is still a very good sports movie. It's paced very well, it has some appropriately humorous and dramatic moments, and it certainly has solid performance by Denzel Washington, Will Patton, and those who are the Titans.

1402729,5,B000056VP3,"Okay, I have kind of dogged a few of the films in this genre over the years.  That whole `by the book inspirational sports movie' is just so generic and clichd and familiar that I can't help but roll my eyes every time I see a trailer for another `Glory Road' or `Miracle'.  I mean, they are all THE SAME.

That said, this was one of the films that started the up-rise in the genre (at least this decade) and it remains one of the (if not THE) best.

I've said my piece about Denzel Washington before.  He is one of those actors that I really like at times but find highly overrated a lot of the time.  Some of his best work (`Malcolm X' aside) never gets attention, yet his more mediocre work nabs all the accolades (no one will ever convince me that his borderline bore-inducing work in `American Gangster' or his ham-fest in `Training Day' is anywhere near as revolutionary as his stunning work in `He Got Game' or his superb character development in `Man on Fire').  This performance, while not his finest hour, is highly appropriate and beautifully understated.

He truly UNDERSTANDS this character.

Set in Virginia, in 1971, the film tells (the true story) of a black coaches struggle to unite his football team during the integration of black students into a white school.  The racial tension is used to perfection here, as apposed to making it a gimmick (so many films try TOO HARD in this area).  You can feel the prejudice stripping away, and you feel swells of uplifting power as the emotional gravity of the film overtakes you.

This is one of those rare occasions where the inspirational sports movie is actually `inspirational'.

You may know who Ryan Gosling, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Hayden Panettiere and Kate Bosworth are now, but I guarantee you that in 2000 they were fresh (and nameless) faces.  They all make an impact here (especially Gosling, who was always a star in my book), and they help fill out an exceptional cast of young stars.  Thankfully, Washington holds his own, but never becomes an overwhelming presence.  He allows this film to remain about the students, which is admirable.  Will Patton also delivers a beautifully understated performance as the reluctant Coach Bill Yoast.

I thank my sister (and her husband) for pressuring me into finally watching this movie.  I was adamant about resisting this film, but peer pressure got to the best of me and I conceded, and I am so happy for that.  You know me.  I am not a huge fan of this genre.  Yes, I thought `Rocky' was an overrated mess and I didn't find `Rudy' to be the uplifting epic so many claim it to be.  I love this movie.

1402754,5,B000056VP3,"Starring Academy Award winner Denzel Washinton (Best Supporting Actor
""Glory,"" 1989), this magnificent and inspiring true story from Walt Disney Pictures about the first integrated football team is very well made. In fact, had it not been for Disney, this would have been an R-rated film, as the original script was full of profanity (every third word being the f-word and every fourth word being the n-word). However, the head of Walt Disney Pictures ordered Jerry Bruckheimer (who produced this film, ""Glory Road"" & the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" & ""National Treasure"" films for Disney, along with the upcoming 4th installment in the ""Pirates"" series and the upcoming ""Lone Ranger"" film) to remove all offensive language from the script, as Disney WOULD NEVER produce anything with profanity, sexual content or graphic violence. All that remains are 3 uses of ""Damn,"" 2 uses of ""Hell"" & 1 use of ""A--,"" all appropriately used. This movie tackles racism head on (pun intended) without using the ""N"" word (probably the only feature film to do so. Refreshing, I must say. Kudos to Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer for remaining committed to producing family movies. The performances in this movie are inspiring, from Will Patton (""Entrapment"") and the lovely Hayden Pannettiere (excuse me if my spelling is off), here very precocious as the football-loving daughter of Coach Yoast (Patton) to the relatively unknown actors playing the football team. Comic at times, but above all, a drama that soars high above the crowd as a winner. I just have one minor gripe: WHY CALL IT A DIRECTOR'S CUT WHEN SCENES ARE SHORTENED OR REMOVED COMPLETELY? In my opinion, a Director's Cut should INCLUDE addiotional scenes, NOT either shorten or delete them. Also, a scene was missing that I saw when this movie aired on ABC where Ronnie Bass' dad was talking to members of the board about moving to Virginia (or something like that).

Directed by Boaz Yakin, the docudrama goes beyond the story it was based on to spin an inspiring and informative tale. Set in 1971, Remember the Titans takes place in Alexandria, Virginia. Because of the desegregation of T.C. Williams High School Bill Yoast is replaced by African American Herman Boone as head coach and takes a position as assistant head coach. The two coaches, as well as the newly integrated football team, at first clash dreadfully. Nevertheless, after a memorable training camp the team rises from its underdog position, integrating not only in body but in mind, supporting each other during tough times, and accepting each other for who they are instead of their race.
 Denzel Washington (Herman Boone) is just one member of the astoundingly talented cast that performs in Remember the Titans. The cast effectively manages to distract from the terribly clich plot and characters- underdogs managing to come out on top, a group coming together, and standing strong against prejudice- and eloquently express the unity, desolation, and triumph of the team. Their performance is accentuated by the amazing soundtrack, an example being that Remember the Titans lets non-football savvy viewers know when the Titans are winning their games by playing upbeat tunes.
 There is some tweaking of history, but that serves to enhance dramatic impact and effectively makes Remember the Titans the powerful docudrama that it is. The original Titans won their championship game 27-0, and were in no way underdogs, dominating their opposition to be ranked second in the nation by the end of the season. In addition, Gerry Bertier was actually paralyzed after playing in the championship game. Stereotyped characters like Emma Hoyt, Alan Bosley, and Ray Budds were fabricated for the docudrama, but their existence helped portray the feelings and views of the populace in the time period. These little modifications are inconsequential, though, as the Titans won the championship games in both reality and fiction, the movie Titans have even more pressure to win their game,  and many people surely had the same opinions as Emma, Alan, and Ray.
 There is no reason whatsoever why one shouldn't watch Remember the Titans. The slight adjustments in the Titans' saga doesn't hinder one's appreciation of it at all; it actually makes one even more inspired by it than if the docudrama had stuck to the actual events. With its awe-inspiring cinematography, themes, and acting, Remember the Titans is a must-see for both movie connoisseurs and unseasoned film watchers.",1243900800,,2678,5.22093023255814
1402756,4,B000056VP3,"Black and White stand together on the field of battle, fighting a war against the racism of the ignorant southerners.  The Civil War?  No, a football team in a newly integrated town in Virginia.

 Remember the Titans starts with racial conflicts in the town, and then shows the progression of different players, like Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), and of the town as a whole, as the team learns to accept their differences and to get past them.  The transformation starts at the intense training camp at a nearby college.  There, Coach Boone (Denzel Washington), the African American coach who has replaced the white Coach Yoast (Will Patton) as head coach, forces students to interact with their teammates of the other race.  Here, they start to learn to work as a team, without worrying about race and skin color.  However, after returning to the town, they reenter the ""real world"" where black and white are still supposed to be separate, and where they are constantly reminded of this by the townspeople (like in racial incidents in the hallways of the school, or bricks thrown through Coach Boone's window).  The town eventually learns, just as the team did, that black and white can live together happily, and peacefully.

The movie, though both entertaining and educational, overstresses the unity of black and white.  Every chance there is, the directors put in some symbol of the togetherness.  Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell change from rivals and almost enemies, to ""brothers,"" holding hands while Gerry is in the hospital.  Gerry's girlfriend (Kate Bosworth), who previously had slighted Julius for being black, shakes his hand before the final game, and, after winning the championship, Coach Boone and Coach Yoast, black and white, hold up the ball together.

 Remember the Titans overplays many of the racial issues and makes plot changes, so it should not be watched for any history lesson.  The rioting shown in the opening scenes never happened at anywhere near that level, and the racial tensions were never that high.  In fact, the school was never segregated, and had been mixed race since it opened its doors two years before the movie is set.  One character, Alan Bosley (Ryan Gosling), never really existed, but was added in to the movie to show the tension caused by black players playing ahead of white players.  Other characters were simply changed, like Ronnie ""Sunshine"" Bass (Kip Pardue), who, although portrayed as homosexual, was not actually gay.  Some other minor characters, like three daughters of Coach Yoast were simply removed from the movie.  On top of this, the actual storyline has been altered quite a bit.  Gerry Bertier played in the championship game, and was only injured after the game.  The championship game was also altered, as the Titans actually won comfortably 27-0, without any last minute heroics. While taking away from the historical accuracy of the movie, these changes add suspense and emotion, making it an overall more entertaining film.

 Remember the Titans is definitely an entertaining and inspiring movie.  Leads Denzel Washington and Will Patton played well off each other, as did Ryan Hurst (as Gerry Bertier) and Wood Harris (as Julius Campbell).  The cinematography was rather bland, using mainly simple panning or stationary shots, although scenes from Gettysburg and from the car smashing were refreshing changes.  Also, although not necessarily accurate, the new, edited story is gripping, alternately causing overflows of either adrenaline or tears.  Remember the Titans is definitely worthy of the 8 awards it won, although it should never be used as a historical guide to understand this time period.",1243900800,2,3711,5.117940199335548

Washington comes in as a coach of a football during troubled times in the South and how he makes the team come together, and watching the team come together, works very well.  Denzel is great as he always is, though I would be hard pressed to think of any movie he was in where he was not very good. Though it may have a couple of borderline cliche moments, they are rare and the movie stays away from being too trite.

I like the fact it was based on a true story and did not realize there was some time shifting of the actual events.

I attended high school in Virginia 1963-1964 and the schools were already successfully integrated statewide without incident and without any ongoing conflict.  The events the story is based on actually took place in 1962-1963.

I contacted the producers of this movie to question why they knowingly altered history and their response was that people would not feel ""connected"" to the story if it took place before the 1970s - that it needed to look more familiar.  The result is a phony story and a false portrayal of the South unsuccessfully lagging six years behind the actual Civil Rights act.

As one of those black characters who's never wrong, essentially because being wrong would make him human, Washington eases past the thicket of platitudes, slipping by child actors whose scene-stealing tactics would shame Walter Brennan and playing off the rest of the otherwise likable young cast like a seasoned session man tapped to mellow the upstarts.",1209859200,2,709,5.068376068376068

1402824,5,B000056VP3,"The Story: In 1971 the T.C. Williams High School is desegregated and Herman Boone Played by Denzel Washington is hired as the Head Coach of the football team in place of the previous coach Bill Yoast played by Bill Patton. This replacing causes an outrage as the white kids refuse to play for a black coach. In order to get the white and black students to play together Boone hires Yoast as his defensive coach and takes the kids to camp to give them a tough lesson in brotherhood. After hard work and being pushed by the coach to get to know each other and see past the colour of each others skin the Titans are born and on entering the season they become an unstoppable team.

The Review: Simply the story telling, the inspirational acting and the fact that this is based on a true story makes this film a masterpiece and something truly memorable. As a person who takes an interest in the race relations of the mid 60s and 70s America, this is an educational film that shows me these decades weren't all full of racial hatred. Denzel, once again takes on a convincing role as Coach Boone. Washington embraces roles from this era and he showed us once again why he is considered one of the greatest African American actors of all time. Ryan Hurst who plays Gerry Bertier, and who in my opinion is a very underrated actor gave an exceptional performance when displaying the young white kid full of hate who then learned the error of his ways to become best friends with Julius Campbell his Black athletic equal.

very well. We had to play them when

it @ Barnes & Noble here in the Ches.,

like this. Bill Yost, the Defencive Co-

because Yost was white and Boone was

black. Period. The movie, in which Denzel

mention that Boone was fired three years

after the Titans won their first VA 'AAA'

state Championship, for improprieties w/

female staff in the offices of the High

his players to get all doped up and then

screwed out of the top job there, that he

Everyone (except for Coach Boone's daughter, Krysten Leigh Jones) delivers outstanding performances. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is sent to an all-white school as assistant coach to Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Before the season begins, desegregation forces a role reversal where Boone becomes the presumably titular head coach of a tension-filled interracial team. ""Coach Coone"" calmly repels most racial remarks but at one point Coach Yoast forces the unforgettable line, ""You're overcookin' my grits!"" In this story based on factual events there are as many injuries, great tackles and touchdowns in the stadium as there are in real life as this unlikely assemblage strives to unite itself and all observers.

1402960,1,B000056VP3,"Based on a true story the film recounts the forced integration of Virginia's T.C. Williams High School in 1971. It portrays how the football team was merged with both black and white students. To further complicate matters the existing white coach is made the assistant to a black coach. This period of American history was a time of social upheaval, and civil rights were foremost on people's minds. Unfortunately, many of the town's people were unable to accept these changes. The parents of these children were prejudice and passed on their discrimination to their sons and daughters.

The movie unsuccessfully tries to provoke conversation about racial prejudice, particularly in small town America where Friday night football is king. The reason it fails is that Boaz Yakin the director tries to make a feel good movie out of a problem that is very real. The football players find a common goal in winning, and slowly become more excepting of their racial differences while at spring training. The parents meanwhile are trying to undermine the black coach at every turn. There is the inevitable brick through the window with the racial slur that frightens the family of the black coach. However, it was passed off as no big deal. The busing of the black children into the school showed the whites protesting until the nice white football players made a stand to stop the harassment and giving a false sense of unity with their black comrades.  Both these scenes, and many other racially questionable scenes, were glossed over to make the movie more pleasant for the movie going public.

When a director makes a movie about such emotional times in U.S. history, they owe it to the audience to be provocative; show it as it really was. The students of that time who were bussed into white schools were terrified. The National Guard was called out. The students were subjected to both physical and verbal abuse. Ironically, these events are sterilized by filmmakers, and do nothing to raise questions to the cinema audience about the times they are portraying.

There were also other underlying types of discrimination in the movie. These were so lightly touched upon to keep the movie a family feel good movie that it was almost insulting to the viewers. There was a sexually ambiguous boy from California, an over weight child, and a girl who know more about football that many of the males. It was as if the director was covering all the bases to be social correct but failed to make a stand engaging the problems of racism, homosexuality, obesity, and women rights. If your going to make a movie about controversial subjects then the director should address those subjects and not sanitized them commercial viewing. Teenagers watching this movie would see a feel good version of the civil rights movement. This is reinforced at the end of the movie. The director adds a postscript listing all the wonderful achievements that the students and coaches achieved in their lives, as if they never had a day of trouble after they came together to win the big game for their recently paralyzed team mate.

Today there is still social economic segregation within our schools; most inner city schools are predominantly black and poor students. There are very few black professional or college level coaches. There is still intolerance of sexual orientation. Americans are the most obese people in the world and yet they still discriminate against over weight people. Women although gaining the right to vote are consistently paid les than males and are often treated as second-class citizens.

The movie was entertaining despite being a shallow attempt to make a feel good movie about subjects that are as pressing today as they were back then. If you base a movie on a true story, keep it true to the facts, even if they do not paint humanity in a good or bad light.",1128470400,4,3864,4.873668188736682
1402961,5,B000056VP3,"Sometimes, when we are part of a team, the sweetest victories are shared outside the playfield.

Such affirmation is true in the case of Remember the Titans, a film based on real life, starring Denzel Washington, Will Patton and a remarkable cast of young actors.

In 1971, high school football was everything to the folks of Alexandria, Virginia. But when the education committee is forced to merge two schools (one of white race, the other African-American), the football tradition is put under test.

To make things worse, Herman Boone (Washington) is brought from South Carolina to teach as a lead coach of the titans, the team of TC Williams High school. His arrival is bad news to the regent coach, Bill Yoast, a kind man, beloved and admired who's relegated to an assistant coach position.

Boone and Yoast accept to work Together, putting their differences aside, while the boys began a long training where they are supposed to learn to respect and tolerate each other to form a united team.

In that process, they also learn that your skin color doesn't matter. And once that barrier is broken, friendship blooms between the boys.

But one thing is to survive camp and the other to confront a community full of prejudice. The Titans are soon forced to face their own realities, social violence, racism, corruption, infuriated parents, friends and personal threats.

Remember the Titans shows you can make a sentimental drama that's effective and not manipulative. Although it harbors one or two clichs, the triumph of this film lies in the honesty and strength played by their characters and the screenwriter's clarity to not sweeten or soften the reality these characters lived.

Denzel Washington delivers a stellar performance as the tough Boon. His demands are sometimes harsh and mean, but he's an honorable man, a winner.

In Will Patton, who gives life to Hill Yoast, Washington finds a perfect complement. As Boone, Yoast is a remarkable man, decent and with a great passion for football and his boys.

The big surprises are the Titans themselves, a group of characters described in sufficient detail to interest us in their lives, relationships and future. They deliver the best as the kids that learn the true value of friendship, the respect of your equals and the satisfaction to be part of a team.

A Dream team in this case. Winners in the playfield and in life, let's remember always the Titans.",1124668800,9,2419,4.918918918918919

1402989,5,B000056VP3,"The movie, Remember the Titans, is the classic tale of good versus evil in the form of racism. It tells the story of how a town and more specifically, a football team and high school, overcame their prejudice to attain one common goal.

The story takes place in Virginia in the 1970's at a time when racism was high. One of the all black schools is shut down, forcing the students to move to a new school which until now, was all white. This is the beginning of a huge controversy with the people of the town. To make matters worse, Herman Boone, the black coach played by Denzel Washington, is hired as the head football coach of the school. The former and very successful coach Bill Yoast, played by Will Patton, who had retired, comes back when he hears about the new black coach and becomes the assistant to Coach Boone.

 All the elements are in this movie for a hometown story about racism. The football players are forced to bunk together in summer camp as the coach instructs them to learn something about each other. As the players start to examine their own prejudices and to form friendships with kids of another race, Coach Boone and Yoast must also learn to get along and eventually become close friends, as do their families. Now the team must learn to battle the prejudice of the town and even the girlfriend of the team captain leaves her boyfriend because of their difference of opinions. The movie ends with the Titans winning the state championship because they did not allow racism to hurt their team. They also won over most of the townspeople.

 I would recommend this movie to anyone who follows sports and especially football. It demonstrates the hours and hours of practice involved in this sport. The game scenes were realistic with bone crushing sound effects and great footage of plays. It was fascinating to hear what goes on in the huddle and between the field and the sidelines. This movie also catches the spirit of high school with the cheerleaders and fans at the games, including the ugly side of it at times. Though there are tragic scenes of violence and a car accident that sidelines a player, there are also many humorous parts as the players get to know each other. No one who will ever see this film will forget the dancing football players singing, ""We are the Titans, the mighty, mighty Titans.""",1111449600,2,2338,4.610576923076923

Remember the Titans is about a high school in Virginia that is addicted to football, and the culture revolves around the football teams. The Titans are a football team that is predominantly white, but then the schools integrate in 1971 and they have to intermingle with the African Americans. The coaching job is changed over to Herman Boone, who is an African American with a successful past record. However, he has to earn the trust of the white players and has to establish his leadership. There are many conflicts in this movie that demonstrate how it was difficult to gain acceptance for Boone, however he is a headstrong character and wins their acceptance.

This movie showed how the Titans, the football team that Boone coached, strived and worked hard to win the state AAA championship. This movie has a very good storyline and is inspiring. I gave it 4 stars because there were some inappropriate things in this movie that I thought were uncalled for, like a time in the locker room when a boy kisses another boy.

After seeing this movie, I researched the real Titans' history and I was surprised (well not really) that the director and producer exaggerated the racism. The article quoted one of the players and he said that things were not as the movie made it seem.  Their problems weren't so much race-based as they were the problems of two different schools trying to combine football teams.  Basically two teams used to having things done their way.

I wish the movie had stuck to what was real...but then, where's the drama in that? </sarcasm>  Check out the true history of TC Williams and you'll appreciate that WAY more than this movie.

BTW, I agree with the reviewers who had to distinguish NoVA(Northern VA) from Southern Virginia.  I totally know where you're coming from.

1403037,5,B000056VP3,"The year is 1971. Coach Bill Yoast ( Will Patton) has led The Titans to fifteen winning seasons. However since the Titans play for an all white school, the school system decides that it is time to intigrate the school with some African American students which leads to a change on the football field as well. This marks the arrival of Coach Herman Boone ( Denzel Washington). Despite his impressive record, Coach Yoast is demoted to Boone's assistant and Boone is made the new head coach. Boone is extremely tough and opinionated, and likes to shake things up. His coaching methods are met with skepticism and resentment from the entire team when he forces the players to look past the color of their skin and treat each other with respect. Watching Boone and Yoast put aside their differences, and turn a group of hostile young men into champions, will give us all a reason to ""Remember the Titans"".

Remember the Titans is an inspiring film that is based on a true story. Disney effectively portrays the story behind the film with talented actors and an amazing musical score. Denzel Washington is great as always. His portrayal of coach Herman Boone is driven with intensity, integrity, and determination. Will Patton gave the best performance as Bill Yoast. He is torn by envy and hate, but still manages to do the best job possible. There was a lot of inner conflict that the character had to overcome, so the transition is really emotional. The football team itself is full of talented young actors that really symolized the spirit of teamwork. All of them do an outstanding job and actually had to go through a football training camp to make their roles believeable. The football action in this film is hard hitting, suspenseful, and realistic. The last thing that amazed me about this film, was that Disney realisticly captured the racism and segregation that went on during that time. It gives an extra sense of tension to the already dramatic film.

Disney definately scores a touchdown with Remember the Tians. The acting, emotional story, and realistic look at racism makes for a very dramatic and important film. The film is also fun to watch with the hard hitting and realistic football action. The DVD is amazing. You get two commentaries - one from the real life coaches Boone and Yoast, and the other from the crew members on the film. There are also two featurettes, an ABC special, and much more.

1403038,5,B000056VP3,"Based on actual events Remember the Titans is a heart warming good for the whole family film. Set in Virginia, in 1971, high school football was everything to the people of Alexandria. The town's unity was put to test when the school board was forced to integrate, T.C. Williams High with an all black school. The values and foundations of the championship football team were suddenly interrupted when black coach from South Carolina Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) was brought up to take the place of white head coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), who is the towns pride and joy in leading the team to several state championships. With tensions thick and the steaks high, the school board has put the pressure on Boone to win every game. The coaches must put their differences behind them and force the boys to become one. Together the team must work together and triumph with courage and spirit to win and bring together a town that has been torn apart by prejudice and bias.

I must say that this is by far one of my favorite movies. It has everything that you could ever want in a story line. Not only is the script well written it is apart of our history and shows the triumph of what our country once had to overcome. It portrays the racial prejudice that occurred during that time perfectly and shows the hardships that people went through dealing with a world full of narrow-minded people. The football team was forced to become a whole and work together as a team putting their differences to rest no matter what the town thought about it.

The whole plot line revolves around this championship football team. Once an all white team now integrated with blacks, have to come together as one in order to win football games. The best part of the film is when the team all bonds as one in camp. At first resisting any type of involvement with the other race except for on the field, and then slowly seeing the brighter side of things. Then head coach Herman Boone rises to the occasion in forcing the boys to relate to each other and learn about one another, not only becoming great friends but playing as an actual team as well. Their trust in each other is tested once they return to school from camp when the whole town is fighting against the integration of the schools. While you sit and watch each game they play you will be sure to get the chills as you watch a team go through their ups and downs. Will they keep it together and be able to lead the team to another championship and make the people of Alexandria come to their senses or will they crumble under the pressures of society?

Although there are not a lot of well known actors in this film, you really don't notice it. Denzel Washington as Herman Boone was simply amazing, like always, he gave a compelling performance. He plays the part of head coach with such ease and composure yet stoic and stern. A perfect man for a football coach dealing with the issues of society while trying to win football games. He is really an amazing actor. Playing assistant coach Will Patton as Bill Yoast who is the other known actor in this movie, also gives a great performance, complementing Washington. Both together are a perfect pair, and are the perfect asset to this wonderful script.

All together Remember the Titans is a wonderful movie filled with passion and desire. It will surely bring you laughter, tears of sadness, and tears of joy, making you want to watch it again and again. Perfect for the whole family, Remember the Titans is definitely at the top of my list and will hopefully soon be at the top of yours.",1096416000,4,3583,4.541795665634675

When Julius is hanging up his poster, Gary says he hates it. Well, what is it? It's obviously a poster implying black power, but how can I find it? Anybody?

However, once it started, I was captivated by it.
The movie is made even better based on the fact it is based on a true story.  The jist of it is this... Herman Boone, played by Denzel Wahsinton perfectly, takes over as new head coach at a high school that has been desegregated.  Naturally, the town has mixed reactions.
We watch as Boone, uses tactics that neither the players, the parents, the townsfolk or even his assistant coaches like to force the players to not only become a team but also respect each other as people.  We watch as friendships form, and as a team forms.
Eventually we watch as the winning football team, and essentially Boone brings the town together.

The white team members are resentful and afraid of losing their places on the team when the black players show up.  After football camp, where the white and black players are forced to work together day and night, they learn that they really aren't all that different and that together they can be unbeatable.

Generally overlooked, however, is the treatment of the players by the coach.  He (the Denzel Washington character) is pretty cruel to them.  The movie condemns racism, but condones this type of treatment.  I just feel that it is really wrong (and harmful) to treat boys this way.
But this is a good movie...not one for repeated viewing...but good for those of us who always hope for the best.",1082937600,2,614,4.486486486486487
1403066,4,B000056VP3,"My high school years were about five years later than the 1971 time frame of this story of football and racial tension.  In my Southern town my school was integrated and the one across town had only a handful of black students, and the tension was there, so I can identify with that and testify to younger viewers that the supercharged atmosphere in this film mostly rings true.
The basic plot is described in other reviews here, so I won't belabor the point.  The filmmakers do a fair job of presenting said racial tension, and even do an unusually good job with the football action, which is apparently one of the hardest things to get right in Hollywood.  The boot camp atmosphere of the team's August training camp gradually brings about the same type of camaraderie that a military boot camp is meant to, where the players eventually learn to fight for one another and become a team.
It's all a bit predictable, with the team eventually forging an unbeaten season and a state championship under the tutelage of their first-year black head coach, and the town naturally falls in love with the coach and the team, although of course the racially insensitive walls have to be beaten down first.  I don't mind the predictability that much because the relationships are handled quite well for the most part and the quick pace of the film doesn't leave us much time to ponder over its imperfections.  They just don't linger long enough to become a problem.
Overall, other than a couple of bothersome inaccuracies, this is a family film about racism and football, certainly unique in that regard.  Kids today hopefully will find the racism of 1971 to be brutally ugly, and we who lived it can verify its reality and open avenues of conversation on the topic.  Perhaps the next generation can continue to make steps toward squashing the less obvious racism that our society still struggles with.  Also, in my book any film with Denzel Washington has a leg up on any film without him, and faith in his superb qualities is rewarded here.
A few words about inaccuracy:  The film paints a picture of the Titans winning the state title on a last-second TD, which to me is one of the big unforgiveables here.  The championship game was actually a 27-0 blowout, with the Titans so completely whipping their opponent that they ended up with negative offensive yardage.  Disney apparently believes we needed the uberdrama of a last-second TD to push it over the top, whereas to me a blowout, the truth, with the Titans just having fun on the sidelines throughout the second half, could have been just as triumphant for the viewers.
Another example of twisting reality to make it fit the Hollywood formula:  The star linebacker who is injured in an automobile accident did not, in reality, miss the championship game.  His wreck was instead AFTER the Titans had won the state title.  Oh, but that doesn't give the screenplay the ""win one for the Gipper"" plot device.  Pardon my indignance, but I just don't like to be emotionally manipulated through lies and exaggerations.
Neither of these problems is as bad as presenting one member of the team as a homosexual.  Even in today's football world this is not tolerated by the supermacho type that football requires, and it's an absolute meaningless joke to toss in an attempt at this kind of social harmony with the main theme of racial harmony.  Science fiction.
There are other inaccuracies, but mostly understandable ones for the sake of expedience (for instance, Coach Yoast actually had four daughters, and the onscreen lone daughter is a composite of the four, but that's a common practice to simplify the story for staging purposes).  I'm also not a fan of the clumsy scenes of players breaking into singalongs at various times.
Taking all these things into account, it's a pleasant and uplifting film that I've seen twice and won't mind viewing against someday, but not one that I've ever gushed about to any friend or coworker.  I'll reserve that for less predictable and less manipulative projects.",1076803200,5,4044,4.801152737752162
1403067,3,B000056VP3,"The film's conclusive message--which acknowleges the achieving of goals through racial harmony-is perhaps stronger than the archetypes used to achieve its effect. However, ""Remember the Titans"" made me feel divided because it seemed to focus on two very unbalanced issues-football and prejudice-by keeping them on an ""even"" level. On one hand, this film is very powerful and speaks to your emotions through the integration of the white and black community in the South. However, on the other hand, it spends too much time categorizing people and situations into a tight, neat little box. The ultimate impression left is that this could have been so much more; I speculate that Disney's knack for erring on the side of overdoing and overstating had much to do with this.
""Remember the Titans"" has dents in its premise. It seems to beg the point that football camaraderie is parallel to racial harmony. The movie implies this message through a series of events: the team must get along to win, if they get along, they have a better shot at winning; if a black and white coach can get along, then prejudice will dissipate; if the team achieves its ultimate goal, then people will remember how we can get along as a community and that we can reach for this anytime there is prejudice.
Other flaws were rampant clichs. The black and white players don't along at first, then they get along and sing songs together on the bus in harmony. We have the halftime speech from Coach Boone (""Give it all you got boys""). We have the big oaf of a football player who ""can't go to college"" because he doesn't have the brains to do it. We have the ""redneck"" stereotypes. And we, of course, have the ""win one for the Gipper"" premise, and, last but not least, the high school football championship scenario. All these scenarios seemed to trivialize what should have been a deeper message. Rather than using stereotypes and predictable events, the producers could have focused more on the social aspect of racism and prejudice, and ways to alleviate it, and it would have had a much stronger effect on its viewers.
I don't mean to completely knock this movie. ""Remember The Titans"" definitely captures the attention of its audience through its message of believing in oneself and coming together as a team. In its ultimate essence, it delves into many of the controversies that we handle in our time: prejudice, determination of goals, fulfillment of dreams and the obstacles that get in the way of those dreams. The action and dialogue may be a bit hokey at times, but the bottom line is that this film exerts a positive final message about what one can accomplish if there is enough effort put into that goal. ""Remember the Titans"" illustrates how there are ways to get past life's obstacles and prejudices and press on to the next level. If Disney could have handled it a little different, however, it would have been a substantially better movie.",1071273600,3,2929,4.790513833992095

1403069,5,B000056VP3,"In recent years, Disney's animation (save for the CG movies like ""Finding Nemo"") have shown a huge lapse in content and quality.  What a pleasant suprise to find that Disney's live action movies are doing just the opposite.
I approached ""Remember the Titans"" with a certain amount of criticism.  Knowing very little about it, I figured it would be another story of an underdog football team rising to glory.  I couldn't have been further off-base.  This movie is anything but a football movie, though football is one of the underlying foundations of the story.
 ""Titans"" is a story about racial awareness, acceptance and understanding.  It is the telling of a ""true-life"" series of events surrounding a high school in West Virginia in the early 70's, and the blending of black and white in a school that was always racially segregated.  The football team, the ""Titans"", is the first to be affected by this change, when a long standing all-star coach is replaced by another coach (masterfully portrayed by Denzel Washington).  The white families turn from the idea that an African-American coach could possibly guide their children.
As the story unfolds, we see children who were brought up in a racially biast environment setting their own prejudices aside and embracing their teammates.  The racial lines blur and the story serves as a reminder that, ultimately, it is not the color of skin that matters, but the size of the heart and the passion contained within that does.  These boys become men, transformed through the game of football, to support and care for one another despite their race.
This movie serves as a reminder that we must look beyond our own prejudices and pre-conceived notions as to what is right and wrong, and instead try to accept, without prejudice, our fellow men and women as part of a greater race-the human one.
A great movie for all ages, though some language and situations might be inappropriate for younger viewers.",1063152000,4,1950,4.935779816513762

Though it focuses on a specific sport, this movie (I guarantee) will be loved by the many who either hate or love sports. This is truly a magnificant movie. It is set in the early 1970's (based on a true story) in TC Williams High School, a school that is about to let both blacks and whites attend this school for the first time. Of course back in that time, many white people were not impressed by the idea.
The school's football coach is about to retire for the season when the white and black football teams have to join together to make one football team, all following the orders of a black football coach, Coach Herman Boon (Washington).
A masterpiece that is both touching and powerful in different ways and mixes with success and tragedy. It has 2 very smart moral of the stories where racism isn't needed in the world and that practice makes perfect.
Great acting is featured here, especially by Washington (which is nothing new!).

Denzel Washington does a great job playing as the football coach; especially in a time when the tensions between blacks and whites were so great (the football team is both black and white; which is great).  There is much pressure on Herman Boone (Denzel), because if he looses one game he will be fired.  This pushes him to push his team and to succeed and to all be friends for life... but I don't want to give the ending away.

1403097,5,B000056VP3,"My interest in football comes and goes from time to time depending on the time of the year but ""Remember The Titans"" is one movie that I will remember for many years to come. This Disney movie starring Denzel Washington is a powerful, true story of a battle against the corrupt forced segregation at the high school in Virginia called T.C. Williams High School located in Alexandria, Virginia where a racial upheaval occurs when football coach Yoast played by Will Patton hires an African American coach named Herman Boone played by Denzel Washington to coach the T.C. Williams Titans and integrate T.C. Williams High School and is threatened with being fired if they lose a single game during their 13 game season. The players meet and hate each other at first but gradually learn to respect each other and use teamwork to overcome their petty differences.
This movie is a marvelous portrayal of the struggle of integration of all, I repeat, ALL colors and the continuing struggle against the corrupt racial segregation and the ugliness of it's outcomes. The story is true and probably the story could not be better told than from the actual former players who actually played the championship game during this turbulent period in1971. The two coaches Yoast and Boone worked together to bring the Titans to victory in the Championship game amidst the racial turmoil and strife that clouds the atmosphere. Disney definitely scores a touchdown with a riveting true story of a turbulent time in America's history. Amidst all of the turmoil and hatred, the spirit of the Titans during this historic year will forever be remembered around the nation as one of the greatest achievements in high school football history. While Alexandria might have been going through racial tough times during the late 60s and early 70s, today, it's now a very diverse city of many different peoples (I lived there once) but de facto segregation has been and continues to be a huge obstacle to integration today.

This movie is thrilling, to say the least.  The emotion behind the white vs. black issue of the time is very apparent.  At first, almost none of the team members want to play with the other race, and almost everyone feels animosity, even hatred, toward each other.

The main theme focuses on the two-sided coin of racial tension and racial harmony. Such moralistic tales can be heavy going but in this case, using school football as a backdrop, director Boaz Yakin creates a moving and entertaining parable.
Set in Virginia around 1971, the story primarily involves the football team at T.C. Williams High. The school is in the middle of a racial integration  process and seems to find the concept, of blacks and whites in physical contact, objectionable. Thrown into this already volatile mix is Coach Boone, a black man from out of state and from a lower grade of football. Boone is placed above Coach Yoast, the current, and white, head of the football department. This strange form of affirmative action is seemingly aimed at political, rather than social, goals.
Not surprisingly Coach Yoast, solidly played by Will Patton, takes umbrage at this obvious slight to his tenure, experience and standing in the community. His young daughter, Sheryl, takes the news with even more disgust. Played by Hayden Panettiere, Sheryl steals every scene she's in, creating a funny and memorable character; a small curly haired girl who loves football more than life itself.
Seeing the danger of his team abandoning  university scholarships just to show solidarity, Yoast steps back onto the team in a subordinate role to Boone. Densel Washington gives us another strong performance as the forceful, and borderline abusive, Coach Boone. His credo seems to emphasise offence, both on the field and off. This is made clear after he challenges the worst elements of the town to face him, following an incident involving bricks flung through his home's windows.
Boone's first act as head coach is to undo the racial divide among his players. Instead, the team is split along offensive and defensive lines. This forced integration soon causes conflict, allowing the audience to explore the large cast of characters in more depth. It is remarkable that so many minor characters stand out in memory and if some of them seem a little shallow, there are limits to what can be achieved in under two hours.
True reconciliation, perhaps even racial harmony, does not begin building until the team is lead on a crippling morning run that finishes at the Gettysburg battle  ground. Boone, who set up the event, gives a shaming speech comparing the ""cause"" that their forefathers fought and died for, to the smaller battles still being fought within their team. In addition, each player was given an ongoing assignment to get to know each and every other member of the team, forcing some level of understanding in most of these young men.
There is a fair amount of football in the film but for me, it was the character expositions and interpersonal conflict that held my interest. I'm sure those who enjoy the game will get a lot more out of the film but the game does not overshadow the strong narrative, creative cinematography and moving soundtrack. In the end, the film's value rests on the shoulders of the two leading men rather than on football. These two honourable men may start out as adversaries but, like the team's offensive and defensive captains, they eventually become life-long friends.",1028332800,10,3322,5.003616636528029
1403135,5,B000056VP3,"""Remember the Titans"" is definetely one of the most uplifting movies I have ever seen. Starring Denzel Washington and Will Patton along with a terrific young ensemble cast, this is a story of friendship and hope, of respect and courage. I really wasn't sure whether I would like this movie since it is all about football, a sport I don't particularly like or understand, but I was pleasantly surprised! The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a Southern high school football team in 1971. There, in the midst of racial conflicts and prejudices, two coaches - one black, one white - must take a mixed group of football players and turn them into a team. Which, as they come to understand, takes more than just training on the field - they must first learn to respect each other, before they expect to win any game. This movie will have you laughing and crying, and, ultimately, rooting for the Titans!!!",1027641600,,913,4.607361963190184

1403138,5,B000056VP3,"I have problems with Disney. They buy up martial arts classics such as ""Fist of Legend"", ""Drunken Master 2"" and ""Tai-Chi Master"", chop them up, repackage them, and parade them out like clockwork. Also, The Disney view of historical events isn't exactly accurate, to say the least. But finally, a Disney movie with some life to it... and it's one that doesn't have Miramax or Touchstone at the top of the credits.
I loved this movie. That's right, I love a non-animated Disney movie, and I'm not ashamed to say it. For one, it had Denzel, and when Denzel is in a movie, my [price] movie ticket is bought and paid for. But it also dealt with a very human story, and a true one at that. A true story where the principal characters were all still alive, with the exception of one. No ""Pocahontas""-type artistic license here, and that was pleasing. The movie deals with the TC Williams High Titans, a high school football team in Alexandria, VA in the early 70's. The Titans were comprised of students from the newly integrated school district. The way they came together over those months up to and including the football season, inspired the entire city to change.
I found that the actors were the greatest assets. They brought out their characters in a way that made you root for each one. You could see the conflicts in each and every movement they made. Every word they said. You could see the almost-obsessive drive in Denzel's Boone, as well as the compassion he had for his players. The conflict of Will Patton's Yoast, torn between doing the right thing and preserving his own legacy as a coach.
I especially liked the evolution of the relationships between the players. They didn't just fall in with each other right away, it was a progression. It wasn't black being right, as proven by the character Julius' militant outlook. Nor was it about white being right, with Gary's hostility towards all not things not bleached out. It was about togetherness, and rising above differences. A very moving and uplifting movie. Sure, there was a heavy dose of schmaltz, but with it being a Disney movie, I wasn't caught off guard (EX: Denzel's last line. ""You're a hall of famer in my book."" Going by the way he delivered that line, you'd think he was tricked into saying it.). I'd recommend this movie to anyone going through a rough patch in life, or anyone feeling an excessive level of hate. Maybe this movie will show them that great things can still happen in this world. Hell, I won't even take a star off for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and I excessively hate him. See this movie.",1024790400,,2583,4.641921397379913
1403139,1,B000056VP3,"I read all these great reviews about this movie... and I gotta tell you guys, I graduated from Hammond in 1968... and the white kids in this movie were not culturally anything like Hammond kids. I've discussed it with classmates and we all agree this movie was pure FAKE hogwash. First of all, I knew everybody at least a little at Hammond and I never heard ANY southern accents. We were children of Washington DC government workers, military kids, etc. Second, the movie was filmed in Georgia!!!! Northern Virginia simply does not relate to southern culture and southern racism at ALL! If this event HAD taken place in Georgia back then (which it didn't), it would have been very very violent and the coach Boone would have been .... There were problems at the time but it was more about the resentment of the CLOSING of our school... but that would have happened anywhere even if it involved all white or all black kids... we weren't southern racists as this movie portrayed... I will say it is accurate that Hammond and GW kids ended up ""getting along""... but that was BECAUSE we weren't racist rather in spite of that... why did they choose to make the film in Georgia rather than say Pennsylvania which was closer to us culturally? Sensationalism... yes, we were residents of Virginia, but Northern Virginia is culturally dissimilar as night and day to southern Virginia. I got really ticked off by the southern racist restaurant owner... he was definitely straight out of Georgia where the film was made ... we didn't have any restaurants like the dump they showed... YUK! we just wouldn't have walked into a place like that even if there were any sleezy places like that. I hate this movie for the lies... I feel it was manipulative, very typical of Hollywood sensationalism... for me it's a lie... and the producer and director are liars who used what happened falsely. The movie would have been very boring I suppose if they had told the truth... but they intentionally made up what they wanted to when they wanted to... the big question is why? If you lived in Alexandria back then and knew Coach Yoast, then he is the true hero of this movie... why? because Coach Yoast loved his kids so much he stuck around to help them give up their school AND he loved all kids black or white... he was a great educator... but we were not southern redneck hicks so don't give the South any credit here... we were from Northern and Midwestern states... southern Virginians resented us because we were intruding ""Yankees"". Some of us who went to Virginia universities later on had some real adjustments getting used to the southern Virginia kids... why? that's where the real cultural divide was at the time... ask anyone from Virginia and they'll tell you about the differences. Boy am I ticked off my school was portrayed the way it was... a bunch of hype!!!! I sure wish they had told the real story in at least half way a truthful manner... enjoy it for what it is FICTION... but never never think that it really happened.",1024704000,33,3022,4.650467289719626

In this country their was a school that had to be torn down and the black kids that went to this school had to move to another school that had only whites.  This was the only school that had a mixture of whites and blacks.  They had to learn how to get alone with each others.  They had the best football team.  They were very good.  They were also undefeated.  The movie was mainly about football team.  How Denzel Washington was so hard on the team.  This is what made the team so good.  The more the team won the games the more the parents started to get alone with each other.  One of the boys on the team got in a car accident and he was paralized from the waist down.

1403163,4,B000056VP3,"If you have teenagers in your household, rent this movie for them. It's rated PG for a reason. This isn't a movie about football; it's a movie about the pointlessness of racism, that uses the football field as a metaphor. That the kids won't understand that doesn't matter, they'll absorb the message while being too entertained to notice.
Disney always produces movies that both young and old can appreciate and so the adults will enjoy the movie too. The script may not be very original and the end result may not reach any deeper than the life-lessons it sets out to teach, but it teaches them with a lot of heart and there's a lot to be said for that.

In this true story, Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone, a no-nonsense football coach who has been handed the job of Head Coach at a high school in Alexandria, Virginia that has suddenly been desegregated. It's the early 70's. His players consist of the school's white football team and the new black kids who played for their former all-black high school team. That these two factions don't want to have anything to do with each other is an understatement. During football camp, through the will and drive, the insight and courage, of Coach Boone, they are forced to treat each other with respect, which turns out to be the first step towards friendship, and they become a more unified team. This all happens a little too easily, but then, it's a feel-good Disney movie, not a three and a half hour Oliver Stone saga. Once school starts, they face the same conditions they faced going into camp: they step into a desegregated school environment that is now segregated internally. The community at large is more to blame than the kids themselves, but that doesn't make the students any less prejudiced. As the football season unfolds, racial lines become more and more blurred for the team members to the disdain of all others around them. Friendships gets tested and relationships get nurtured, on and off the field, including the growing but guarded friendship that takes root between Coach Boone and his assistant coach, Bill Yoast, (a convincing performance by Will Patton). Yoast was head coach before he was forced out to make room for Boone, and is a hard-edged but, we slowly find out, open minded and big hearted, member of the white community.

Denzel Washington puts in his usual winning performance. One wishes that his character was written with a little more depth and was less of the Cheerleader-for-the-Movement variety. What he does with the script that he's handed, however, is memorable. In fact, you can tell Washington is relaxed and enjoying himself here; he doesn't exactly have to stretch his acting skills to nail this character, and it's obvious that it's a character he believes in.
Hayden Penettier who plays Coach Yoast's daughter Sheryl, is hilarious as a 7-or-so year old tomboy who calls her father ""coach"" instead of ""dad"" and knows more about football than most of the players do. She's a very talented young actress and this role should land her more significant ones. She very nearly stole the show.
The various members of the football team are a well-rounded and capable group of actors even if they're your standard stereotyped bunch of characters. They're the primary source of fun in the movie, filling up the screen with various locker-room antics. The strongest of these characters is Gary Bertier, the white team captain (played by Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (played by Wood Harris) the strongest minded black player, who start out as enemies and whose evenutal friendship plays a pivitol role in the film.
Remember the Titans is the kind of movie Hollywood is continually accused of not making: a movie aimed at kids that doesn't pander to sex and violence. That it isn't Oscar material should be of no consequence. It may not have won any awards, but that doesn't make it any less worthy of an audience.",1015372800,24,3911,4.818452380952381

1403168,5,B000056VP3,"THE MOVIE
I thought this was an excellent film and was well done in several aspects.  First off, the talent is top notch with the phenomenal Denzel Washington in the lead as Coach Boone.  Not to be overlooked and a very unappreciated talent is Will Patton as Coach Yoast.  Both actors play off of each other well and I believe Patton has the more difficult role as someone who starts out against the protagonist, Coach Boone and gradually comes around.  I also thought his accent was top notch.
The youngsters they found for the football players were outstanding with Wood Harris as Julius Campbell and Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier getting special mention.  They too have difficult ""transitional"" roles where their characters start out cold and set in their ways and gradually turn around.  Both of these young men do an excellent job.
The football scenes were great in an action sense.  I love football but I'm hardly a tactician of the sport so I can't tell you how realistic they were.  However, the film does a great job of lending import to the games but making it clear the games were not the focal point of the journey these characters, and their real-life counterparts, took together.
THE DVD
First of all, there are TWO different DVDs for this movie so I don't think you should be complaining about there not being a widescreen because there definitely is one.  In fact, the Widescreen Edition is stellar with both Dolby Digital and DTS soundtracks.  A big plus just for that alone given my preference for DTS.
The extra features on the Widescreen Edition are stellar.  About the only complaint I have is the disc doesn't let you change audio while watching the movie, you have to go back to the menu to change it (a minor annoyance).  This is more than made up for with the supplemental material which includes some great featurettes and, best of all, commentary tracks from the real-life Coach Boone and Coach Yoast.  This is a great way to find out what in the movie was real, what was exaggerated and what was made up.  Much to the surprise of many cynics you will find they approved of the film and there is little that was changed for dramatic purposes.
CONCLUSION
All-in-all this is an oustanding film and an outstanding DVD, I highly recommend it.  For those who didn't think it was ""realistic"" or the language was toned down, I say hogwash.  Sit your kids down and MAKE them watch it.  Films like this will hopefully inspire future generations to better their relations with people of another race, another culture and another creed.

1403184,5,B000056VP3,"Okay, I'll admit it -- I've never been a big Disney fan. I'll go out on a limb here and say that I've never been a big football fan, either. Obviously when going to see this movie, then, one could say that I had the usual expectations -- a bunch of jocks sappily growing to like each other in the traditional Disney style.
I was totally off-base on that one! This was one of the really cool movies, for a number of different reasons. The movie begins the same way that it later ends -- at a funeral. We don't know who the funeral is for at first, but we don't really care -- why? Because an attractive young lady with a southern accent is telling us a story -- the story of the Titans football team in Virginia in the 1970's.
Blacks and whites didn't get along, meaning they certainly didn't play high school football together. The new head coach at T.C. Williams High School plans to change all of that, however. Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is ""given"" this job by school board bureaucrats who want to remain politcally correct. Former Head Coach Bill Yost (Will Patton) stays on the team as Assistant Head Coach.
Racial tensions are obviously flaring at this point -- Yost is pissed off because Boone stole his job and wants blacks to play on the team -- Boone is pissed off simply because there's so much racial tension. When it's time for the blacks and whites to go away to camp with one another, the whites immediately go to ""their bus"" and the blacks go to theirs. Boone corrects this -- he organizes his team, not by color, but by ""offensive"" and ""defensive.""
The team goes away to camp and with the strict guidance of Coach Boone most of the players become friends with one another. While at camp, we encounter what begins as ""the problem of homosexuality,"" but by the end of the film becomes ""the acceptance of homosexuality"" -- nicely done by a Disney film!
Returning from camp, the Titans go on to win every game they play and make it to the championship against a ""can't-lose"" team. On top of this, star player Gary Burteer becomes paralyzed. The big question becomes: Will the team be able to win without Gary?
The acting is excellent -- throughout the movie, it's important to remember that the actors are portraying real people as this movie was based on a true story. Washington plays Boone perfectly -- he's strict and rarely let's up, yet we see why he's so strict and why it's so important for him to succeed. Similarly, Patton portrays Yost with just the right amount of initial jealousy and eventual acceptance of the situation he must share with his head coach.
See this movie -- it will make you realize that seeing a person's color is okay, as long as you appreciate it as part of the person. Remember the Titans succeeds in teaching viewers about prejudice, leadership, and attitude. Rating: 4 / 4.

Okay, so it drifts off to the corny land sometimes, and the running time is a bit long, but no worries, this remains really entertaining thanks to excellent casting, a touching script and well-directed American football sequences. Denzel Washington gives a masterful performance as the honest, brutal and determined Coach Boone. It is one of his best after The Hurricane, I couldn't take my eyes off Denzel. His character was a revelation, someone I'd really like to play in a movie. The supporting characters do just fine and give Denzel his back-up. The film's goal is to make people care for its story and characters and we do, strongly. The movie reaches into our hearts with its soul and harmonic expression. I think the fact that Remember the Titans is a true story helped it become more enjoyable and more real. If this wasn't a true story you'd probably be saying ""yeah, right"" to some of the events. The thought of knowing this really happened and that the characters are real made the experience much more touching and entertaining. This is not the most important element in a film, but I loved the music too. The soundtrack is worth the money and has plenty of classic playable tunes. So, if you can forgive Remember the Titans for at times been a bit of a corn-dog, you'll have a memorable and fantastic film that demands your attention and gets it.",998352000,2,1454,4.728346456692913

It was also a different film for Jerry Bruckheimer Films.

The film does a great job of inspiring positive race relations.  It would be great if every high school sports team could come together like this one.
We only buy movies that we feel comfortable letting our young children watch, and this is definitely one we can own!  The only things some parents might find objectionable for their young children is the high intensity coaching, minimal violence/protests regarding race relations, and perhaps the films inspiring effect on mom's little boys to grow up and play the dangerous game of football. :)

  Remember the Titans is the true story of a small town in Virginia during the 1970's. The ""white"" high school and the colored ""Black"" high school are forced to combine into one school, the T.C Williams High School. From then on, everything turns to trouble, there are rallies, fires and fights. But just as the current football coach Yoast is about to enter the Virginian high school football hall of fame, he is replacded by his job by the new head coach, Coach Boone (amazingly acted by Denzel Washington), an experienced African- American Football Coach, from North Carolina. He asked Coash Yoast, to be assistant head coach when the two high schools combine. On top of this being between the two coaches, they both have to figure out how to bring the two teams into one team, the Titans and try to end the prejudice between the white and the colored players. Despite of the above description, the movie does a great job balancing itself so that it is dramatic and you are able to understand what racism was like during that time period, but there is plenty of humor to cause you not to be upset during the entire film. This Movie is Defintly a Must Buy, becuase I have seen this movie numerous times, and never get tired of its humor, drama and prejiduce. This movie has made me laugh, cry, and made me very much wiser about the world. I suggest buying it, but if you are always like me you always have to see it first.

1403241,4,B000056VP3,"Having lived in Alexandria VA from 1962 to 1979, and graduated from GWHS, I had difficulty watching this movie as a true story.  In fact, it is very loosely based on fact.  Once I put that aside, I was able to enjoy a spirited story of the difficult process of overcoming superficial differences and finding the heart of another.  This movie works well to that end.  The interactions between Yoast and Boone and Bertier and Campbell are classic.  At times it waxes melodramatic, such as the scene where Lastic learns that he has gone from a failing status to college material in one football season!
Just for the record, Alexandria was an ""All American City"" in 1971 and racial integration first took place in the mid 60's.  The tensions in the three schools merging had a lot more to do with the fact that three bitter rivals had just become one school.
This is definitely a video worth owning and enjoying.  It is good clean fun and promotes the message that we need to talk with each other and not allow the outward appearances to keep us apart.  Enjoy the show.",992822400,2,1065,4.539267015706806

I just loved REMEMBER THE TITANS, and it's an excellent film. The football scenes are even awesome, too.

1403255,4,B000056VP3,"""Remember the Titans"" is a film that succeeds and fails, a good movie with flaws, one might say. It tells the story of two coaches on the same football team amidst racial turmoil in America, and their struggle to keep the team together. The movie also focuses on the members of the team, showing their reactions to being placed together in the same group, and their growth as a team and, more importantly, as friends. On these two grounds, the movie works.
Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone, a football coach who, because of a new law passed opposing racial segregation in the South, takes the place of fifteen-year coach Bill Yoast, played by Will Patton. Not only that, but the football team must also incorporate black players into its roster, providing for some very high tension among the white team members, as well as the newcomers.
Boone, however, is unshaken by this tension, providing Denzel Washington an outlet for yet another riveting performance. He comes through unscathed and triumphant, playing Boone with a drive and an earnestness that have become Washington's trademark as an actor. Boone becomes a hard-hitting coach, forcing his players, black and white, to work together, putting them not only through the physical exercises, but making them get to know one another, pairing them off with a person of different race.
As you may have guessed, the teammates get to know one another and start to get along, too, though the movie's hurdles do not stop there. After a return from football training camp, the now-friendly players must face the ongoing racial hatred and intolerance in their community. THe movie goes from being interesting to powerful in this turn of events, as the group finds themselves in a place where their friendships are looked down upon.
As the movie works all of these conflicts out, it tells a very uplifting story. Based on real-life events, it keeps our interest by evoking such a high human emotion factor that we come to care for the characters, and what will come of the situations they face. The struggle between black and white soon evolves into a struggle of unity versus ignorance, and the segue is well-handled by director Boaz Yakin, who instills in his film a great deal of heart, human strength, and courage.
Still, there are minor flaws. Many will no doubt agree that the film is advertised as a family feature, and for the most part it is. But there are some pieces of the story I was shocked to find included in the story, such as that of one football player's homosexuality, and his forthright revelation of his orientation in the locker room. This seems highly out of place in the movie, and may have worked better were this not a family-oriented movie.
I am also left wondering why a movie about racial unity tends to lean more to one side of the arena. All around our characters there is a mix of white culture, from songs to styles, something the movie does profusely. The black members of the football team are seen as invaders, but the movie never really gives us a chance to get to know how they feel about being cast into an uncomfortable situation. The movie is not hypocritical, but it does lose some focus from what the central message is trying to say.
As with any good movie, you're going to have your share of flaws, and ""Remember the Titans"" is one of them. There are elements that some will find out of place, but the overall effect the movie has is more than enough to suffice seeing it. The story of the human spirit is outstanding and effective, while creating characters we can relate to and care for. Don't dismiss it as a sports movie; it has more to offer.",991180800,3,3643,4.69375

Basically The races are at each others throats, then the team comes together, then begin the cycle again.

1403260,5,B000056VP3,"""Remember the Titans"" is one of the best films our family has seen in the past year. We just watched the classic basketball film ""Hoosiers"" a few weeks ago, so I was expecting ""Titans"" to be a football version of the same story. Of course there are some distinctive similarities, but ""Titans"" is about much more than football.
""Remember the Titans"" tells the story of school busing in the early 1970s to achieve racial balance in urban schools. This was happening all over the country, so this film gives us a slice of life in a Virginia high school not uncommon to what was happening elsewhere. It's about overcoming stereotypes and prejudice and getting to know people of other races as individuals. It's about taking people from different cultural perspectives and bringing them together to make a cohesive team. It's really an encapsulation of the American story, one we often call a ""melting pot.""
This American story goes on. As I write, the Seattle Mariners have two star players from Japan. I'm sure the racial and cultural mix going on within that team is very interesting, although hopefully not as volatile as it was on the Titans. The point is, in our society, we are constantly being confronted with meeting, working, playing, or going to school with people who are from different backgrounds. ""Remember the Titans"" helps us remember the struggles we've gone through in the not-too-distant past, and it perhaps reminds us that we still have a long way to go.
Another related film that is worthy of consideration is ""Finding Forrester,"" although the language is a bit rougher.",990403200,,1588,4.885185185185185
1403261,5,B000056VP3,"After working in a video store for nine months, it's hard to find a good new release. Pretty soon, you begin to nit pick everything about the plot, director, actors, characters, etc. So, when I took a chance on this football movie, I wasn't expecting to be blown away.
Not only is Denzel better than ever, so is Disney! When first deciding whether or not to actually take this one home, I had to think about the dreading football action. (You know, all of the stuff that the guys want to see) Honestly, this one isn't another guy show. Remember the Titans is about so much more.
In a time of corrupt racism, the boys of a small southern town are forced to be civil, and it even goes farther than that. The black football team and the white football team must play as one. They must join to stay in the game, and the players must get along. This movie is about dreams, determination, hope, and fear.
This movie is excellent! I guarentee it won't be a waste of your time. From the very beginning the magic was there, and it flows throughout the show. If you like drama, you'll love Remember the Titans. Ever hear of the ""Clash of the Titans""? Well, this movie gives another meaning to the phrase.

1403292,5,B000056VP3,"The movie Remember the Titans starring Denzel Washington was outstanding.  One of the best movies I have ever seen.  I would call it one of Denzel's best.  Taking place at T.C. Williams high school (an all white school) a coach by the name of Coach Boone tries and makes the blacks and whites go to school together.  It all starts out with Boone becoming the football coach at T.C. high.  He goes there only to be an assistant but ends up becoming the head coach over coach Yoast (Will Patton).  He takes all of the football players both black and white to a camp to try and make them work together as a team.  They have to do some extreme practicing until they can respect one another.  By working together they become champions.  While playing with each other some very strong friendships are made between the black and white players especially between Gery and Julius.  Before they become friends their is some rough times between them.  A quote that Gery says to Julius that really sticks in my head is, ""you ain't nothing, nothing but a waste of God given talent.""  This quote to me shows that he believes in Julius and thinks that he is a great athlete with a lot of potential in football.  This part in the movie I believe starts to build a bond between these two men.  They really start to get along and have respect for each other and their races.  They learn to work together as a team and not as separates.  I reccommend this movie if you haven't seen it already.  It shows you how rude people were to each other back in the days when racism was a big issue.  It also show that if you try and work together you can become friends.  It doesn't matter if you are black, white, purple, or green, it is what kind of person you are on the inside that counts.  I believe this movie really shows you this and I think if you haven't seen it then you should go because it is a must see movie.",989798400,3,1894,4.296610169491525

It was His team before Denzel came along, but they gave the team to Denzel hoping he would fail. Another, ""We can't fail"" movies, but it is done so well. The story is also very good. This is about a high school football team that needs to start having blacks and whites on the same team. This is the only school in the conference that is doing this right now. You can see that even though this story takes place in 1971, there are still a lot of stupid, ignorant people around that wanted to keep everything separate. If you don't find this movie entertaining and uplifting, then I would like to know a movie that is better. This movie goes in the same category as Rocky and Karate Kid.

1403295,2,B000056VP3,"I am a fan of movies.  Most of my friends are fans of film.  I consider myself fairly easy going when it comes to reviewing movies because I only have two requirements: (1) I walk away feeling entertained and (2) the acting is decent enough to at least keep me in my seat for the entire duration of the movie.  Therefore, before I buy a DVD, I read all the reviews... and look for comments to those effects.  Was the reviewer enthusiastically entertained? (ie. Even if the story wasn't believeable, did the reviewer walk away feeling like they'd seen something cool.)  Was the acting above par? (ie. Did the reviews bash the acting of any of the actors?)  Unlike my friends who appreciate good film (ie. good plot, cinematography, musical score, character development, etc.), I just appreciate good movies.
This was NOT a good movie for the following reasons.  I felt like I was watching ""Varsity Blues 2: Emotional Victory.""  But this time, they decided to go low-budget all the way to the endzone.  The acting was terrible for the most part with the exception of a good performance by Denzel.  But to call this movie ""Denzel's Best Yet"" as one review did is probably a bigger insult than the intended compliment.  And the daughter of Coach Yoast?  Cute girl, but can you say, ""overacting?""  Now I can see how Hollywood gets actors who look 10 years younger than they are... Ralph Macchio step aside, this girl was probably a 16 year old cast as a 7 year old who was acting like a 16 year old.  At least Ralph had everyone believing he was 16.
This movie was also a lesson in how NOT to compile a soundtrack.  The songs were supposed to bring you back to the day when this movie took place, but instead I found myself thinking about driving along in my car and listening to the oldies station.  I believe it was the costumes and set design that contributed to my feeling that the movie just wasn't taking place when it was supposed to.  Watch the beginning of ""Born on the 4th of July"" to get an idea of the era ""Remember the Titans"" was going for... but failed miserably at reconstructing.

1403296,1,B000056VP3,"""Remember the Titans"" is what you would get if you mixed the basic plot from ""The Bad News Bears"" and some of themes in ""Do the Right Thing"" together.
This movie is basically the standard high school sports movie with racial tension thrown in to give it extra dramatic zing.
The acting is fine, although the actors portraying the high school students/football team look to be in thier mid to late twenties, I kept thinking they where all in college.
The soundtrack is just the average collection of 50's/60's/70's music that you can hear on the radio a hundred times a day. If you want to see how a soundtrack is supposed to work in a movie see Rushmore or for that matter any of Leone's westerns.

1403299,5,B000056VP3,Remember the Titans is the best movie I have watched all year. There isn't one bad actor in this movie and Denzel Washington is exceptionally great. The movie set in a Virginia town with a young girl narrating the story at a funeral. She tells the story of how a black coach named Coach Boone(Denzel)moved to town and became the assistant coach to an all white highschool football team. This is during the civil rights movement in the 70's and the town is very tense. You can just imagine how upset they are when a black coach coaches the highschool football team. The football team is the Titans. They are the best in the region.  Boone was a coach in North Carolina and he had the best team in the region. Boone lets white and black players on the team and that causes a large disturbance between the players. They hate each other. Boone fixes this throughout the video until the point when the players love each other no matter what color they are. I refuse to tell the rest because it is such a good video. The action in his video has hard hits in the football games and the fights going on because of the different races. The sound and picture were great on the VHS and would be superb on DVD. I recommend this video to all and you should buy it. There is no need to rent it unless you are very unsure if you would like this movie.,988502400,5,1336,4.280632411067193

  I have since watched it three times and will probably purchase it, as it is just one of those movies you have to own. Another thing I was very impressed with; strong points were made throughout the movie, yet without all the typical profantiy you hear in most movies today. It had the strong 'in your face messages' and all without one F--- word! I didn't have to plug my 5 year-olds ears for once. Sure hope they make more movies like this one.
  I know I am going on and on, I really don't get this excited over movies anymore, this one just surprised me... football and all, LOL!
  The actors were great and should be proud of their work, as this movie could be very healing, as well as entertaining. Maybe it will help a few of us see past the color of a person's skin and into their heart of a man or woman.

He replaces the former coach, a white man, who at first refuses to coach as an assistant.  Eventually, though, Coach Yoast does serve as an assistant in order to work with his white players.  Boone is equally tough on black and white players and during training camp they learn that they will have to play as a team in order to survive the coach as well as the season.  Coaches and players begin to have grudging respect for one another and eventually they become leaders in the integration effort.  Relationships blossom and tentative friendships are begun as the Titans roll to an undefeated season.  The deck is stacked against them in the State Championship game and the two coaches work together to combat crooked referees and bigoted bystanders.

What we get is a Perfect Example of Feel Good, Family Entertainment, with a touching story that will get to you.
Jerry Bruckheimer knows how to fill a film with a Great cast, and ""Remember the Titans"" is No Exception.
Denzel Washington (also in ""Crimson Tide"" - another Bruckheimer production) plays a High School Football Coach who has to lead a Racially Mixed Football team to Glory. He makes the character Tough, but Likeable, and he adds yet another Brilliant performance to his Resume. (his list of Memorable Performances must be nearing the length of Robert De Niro's)
He is Very Well Supported by the Talented bunch of Newcomers who make up his team. Every one of the Guys give a Wonderful and Touching performance and they all come off like Seasoned Pro's. Will Patton (also in ""Armageddon"" - another Bruckheimer production) is as Brilliant as ever as the Coach who Denzel takes over from. Will has always been one of my Favourite Supporting Actors, and his role here only makes him Stronger.

1403344,5,B000056VP3,"I first saw ""Remember the Titans"" in the theater with a group of younger friends, who did not live through the civil rights movement or the uneasy truce that existed through the next 10 years.  It was interesting to see their reactions to the chasm that existed on the ""battlefield"" of the public school system. Although ""RtT"" doesn't explore the issues of the time in a substantive way, the film makes it easy to believe that the situations were real.  The football field action is impressively filmed and the soundtrack is outstanding.
Will Patton and a terrific cast of young actors will entertain you and make you believe for the run of the movie.  And although some scenes are corny, (every scene that features Coach Yost's daughter!) you find yourself caught up in not only the game, but in what it represents as a centerpiece for a small town or city.
I confess that there is no movie featuring Denzel Washington that I don't like!  His performance here is solid, and he hides his natural charm well - Coach Boone is not a charming guy!
In DVD, the film is enhanced with many special features that are just as entertaining as the movie.  I particularly enjoyed the discussion between the two coaches and the items that were edited out of the movie.

1403359,4,B000056VP3,"Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Top Gun"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""The Rock"", ""Flashdance"", ""American Gigolo"") is a master of bringing crowd-pleasing films to the public.  Once again, Bruckheimer hits with this inspirational human-interest story.  This script was rejected dozens of times before it found its way to Bruckheimer's desk.  He immediately saw the potential and began shopping it around until Disney picked it up.
It is a true story of a high school football team in 1971 during the first year of forced integration in the Virginia.  The team members are compelled to confront years of racial hatred and bigotry if they are to come together as a team and win.  To add to the tension, a black coach is installed as head coach, replacing a popular white coach with a history of having winning seasons.
Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) runs the team like a marine boot camp.  He forces the boys to put their prejudices aside so they can coalesce into a winning football team.  He faces obstacles within the team as well as those from the parents and the school board.  Everyone is waiting for him to fail so they can pounce on him.  He never gives them the satisfaction.
This is an stirring story that accurately represents the open racial hostilities of the time, especially regarding forced integration.  It gives us excellent character development of coach Boone and coach Yoast (Will Patton), as well as players Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris).  Though the plot is predictable, it is such an inspirational story that it doesn't become tedious.  There are a few oversimplifications of complex issues, like when the team overcomes a lifetime of bigotry in two weeks of football camp.  However, there are also a number of memorable and emotional scenes.
The acting is terrific across the board.  Denzell Washington gives the coach a very hard edge while maintaining a certain tough charisma.  Will Patton does an outstanding job portraying coach Yoast, a man stuck in the middle of forces that are ripping his life apart.  This is the best performance I've seen by Patton, who has always been a solid supporting actor.  The selection of Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst for the student leads is a bit of a stretch age wise (Hurst is 25 and looks older, and Harris is 31).  However, both actors deliver brilliant performances, supercharged with intensity on and off the field.  Eleven-year-old Hayden Panettiere is fantastic as coach Yoast's football obsessed daughter, stealing every scene in which she appears.
The DVD has a good deal of interesting material including interviews with the real coaches Boone and Yoast as well as player interviews.  The DTS sound on this DVD is nothing short of awesome, making the music powerful and sounds of the action on the field explosive.
This film is classic Bruckheimer.  It sweeps us up and gets us totally involved with the characters, while putting impediments in their way so we can root for them.  I rated it an 8/10.  For most viewers, this will be an uplifting experience.",985651200,5,3048,4.933333333333334

My father was a star football player at a nearby school during this season, then worked for the Alexandria City school system and actually knew these people, so I had much more information available than most viewers would.  I personally took offense at the portrayal of Alexandria,VA as some hayseed little town. I lived and went to high school there. It is a mainly affluent historical city just across the river from Washington D.C. populated with government workers. The three high schools in town merged as a population move, not on any racial motivation, since they were all fairly mixed for some time, and I seriously doubt most people who lived there gave too much thought to the record of the high school football team, even though they were ranked first nationally before the season began.
 Taken as pure fiction, it was a fine enough film and had all the prerequisite football movie cliches, but I think it could have worked just as well without some of the racial tension.

And by and large although you could certainly see the animosities that existed they all seemed to just melt away too easily.  Sadly I cannot say that this is true about society in general.
Denzel was more convincing as a football coach than I had anticipated him being which was a pleasant surprise.  The film didn't make light of any of the issues but I also don't feel that the film gave adequate weight or examination of many of the issues either.

The movie is an outstanding piece of cinema.  It adresses a social issue with raw emotional power. It teaches a lesson without screaming it in your face.  The acting is without a doubt full of some of the best performances of the year to not have been recognized by Oscar and the likes. While Denzel Washington and Will Patton are phenomenal the show is stolen by the members of the team.  Watch this film and you will get the point.  An emotional five star film worth watching again and again.",985219200,44,1225,4.51131221719457
1403394,5,B000056VP3,"This is by far one of the best films I've seen in a long time.  It captures a multitude of feelings from high to low.  This movie demonstrates the strength of the human spirit to overcome many challenges.  I too initially watched the movie on a flight and it instantly went to the top of my purchase list, and I encourage others do so as well.  This isn't the best movie of all time, but it is certainly a fine edition to any DVD collection.  I'm not even a big sports (football) fan, but I still thought this was a great film.  Buy it today, you won't be disappointed!",985046400,2,569,4.174311926605505
1403395,5,B000056VP3,I was in High School in Northern Virginia during this time. My High School played TC WILLIAMS for the championship. George C. Marshall High School and I was at this game. Watching this movie had special meaning for me. I laughed and Cried and remembered that special time in my life. Denzel is so good in this as is Will Patton and all the ball players. I think this movie can teach us alot about ourselves and each other if we just open our minds. Watch this one with your kids.,985046400,2,479,4.274725274725275
1403396,5,B000056VP3,"When I orginally saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, ""yet another movie about football.""  And while I like the sport, I'm a huge football fan, but I can't see movies about it.  While returning home from a Bowl Game, they showed this movie on our airplane.  You get drawn into the characters.  When they start to become close with one another, you feel as if you are right there.  It's a great story, that is a good movie for young and old.  So all those women out there....this is a sports movie for date night!",985046400,,518,4.288659793814433
1403397,5,B000056VP3,"I went to T.C. Williams in the mid 80s. There was a bond that existed at that school between black and white, between Asian and Latino, a bond that crossed many different cultures. It existed in the city. I'm not saying everything was perfect. But the racial harmony that so many in the world are trying to find, existed there. From what I know that team truly did unite the town. Never underestimate the importance of a common cause of bringing people together. That is the power of sports in this country. That is very much the message at the core of this film. I knew both Coach Boone and Coach Yoast. Two finer men I defy you to find. These men are real, not fictional. I thank God that these guys helped pave the way for the wonderful educational AND cultural experience I had at T.C. Williams. Go Titans!!!",984960000,3,812,4.42
1403398,5,B000056VP3,"Truly one of the best movies ever!  I saw this on an airplane, and had tears in my eyes the entire movie.  When it was over, I saw plenty of other passengers wiping their eyes!  A truly historic look back at a painful, yet transforming time in our history.  Denzel was terrific!  Every American must see this - especially our younger citizens who have no idea what we went through in this country in the 60's and 70's.",984009600,7,418,4.3076923076923075

1403400,5,B000056VP3,"This would have to be one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in years. The performance of all the actors in this great film, makes this movie a worthy winner of any award that it may acheive. Denzel Washington gives another great performance and so does Will Patton, Overall this is a movie that makes you feel good when it has finished.",982108800,,345,4.323076923076923
