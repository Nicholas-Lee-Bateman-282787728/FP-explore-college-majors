7489310,5,B0176IELOY,"David Guggenheim may be a bit sensationalistic in his telling of Malala Yousafzai's story and certainly doesn't provide an enormous amount of political and historical context (highly unlikely anyone can in 88 minutes). But he tells an inspiring story of a girl and her father that is accessible enough to appeal equally to young girls and their parents. And it's the former who need to hear this story and understand the profound importance of speaking out for your rights, standing up for yourself in the face of adversity, and realizing that while education is a right, it shouldn't be taken for granted.",1452297600,,606,4.950980392156863

7489313,4,B0176IELOY,"Malala is THE inspirational figure of our times. This was a riveting movie for me, but I have been following Malala Yousafzai for some time now and know much of the story.  I would suggest someone watch the BBC documentary, or read her book, before watching this, as this movie bounces around a bit.  Malala is an inspiration and I would love to see a professional feature film made of her life to spread her story to the masses.",1450828800,9,429,4.417721518987341
7489314,5,B0176IELOY,"As a historian of International History, with a focus on Pakistani-US relations, I will certainly be recommending this to any of my students (especially girls) who are interested in a relatable look at education in a troubled country. We so often take our education for granted here in the US, free all the way through high school, and with scholarships and loans (...maybe the loan part's a little less wonderful) readily available, while a child like Malala has to fight for her right to have books and learn.

Pakistanis have so often yearned for more than what corrupt religious groups or political parties or colonial and global powers have allotted them, and they have raised their voices through poetry or books or speeches or independent films, come what may, even if they pay with their lives or freedom or are unrecognized for their efforts abroad.

Malala is a such an example, with the exception that this impoverished girl from an isolated, small valley has managed to reach a global platform. Threatened by the extremist Taliban with no education and no voice, she sets out (with the example and encouragement of her laudable father, himself a teacher and vocal protestor of the taliban's hijacking of Islam) to reclaim education, women's rights, and moderate Islam from the barbarians who demolish her beautiful Swat valley.

Despite the terrible violence she suffers at the hands of the taliban, Malala is forgiving and retains her idealism and strength of spirit, which is perhaps the most inspiring thing about her. And yes, to respond to the early negative review of one Tim Smith, this is a cause for celebration and celebrity. It is not that so many others have not suffered like she has, it is that she gives them all a humanizing face--one that is half paralyzed and scarred now, but one that still giggles when playing with her brothers or looking shyly at tennis player crushes or while humorously signing her own book with a note to herself.

When Pakistan was established in 1947, two men were responsible for the transformed map of South Asia--Muhammad Iqbal, a poet, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, a highly educated lawyer and the leader of his nationalist movement to liberate minorities from the British as well as the Hindus. Neither men lived long enough to see their dreams for Pakistan's future fulfilled (Jinnah died of TB only a year after)--dreams of tolerance, education, democracy, and women's and minorities rights on a national scale. And in the years to come, Pakistan was ravaged by regional and global political interests that have stunted its realization of the ambitions of its founders. However, in brave and tenacious citizens like Malala, there still breathes hope of that dream. She's right, one person and one pen can indeed change the world.",1450396800,26,2788,4.963597430406852
7489315,1,B0176IELOY,"A really awful film. Smug, preachy, lacking any substantive content and Condescending. Its not really a documentary. Instead its sort of a PR kit for Celebrity Superstar Malala (tm). Malala has been ""packaged"" like a political candidate. She is ""sold"" through the film like a big mac or a can of soup. Anyone looking for a real human being should just forget it. Anyone looking for questions to be asked should look elsewhere. The film fills space with all sorts of cute kid/family filler. The father comes across as a rather typical stage parent. The mother is almost invisible which is odd.

The film also grossly misrepresents the history surrounding her name.

After peace between the Afghans and British had been reached and the British were beginning to plan to leave the country, a regional warlord launched an attack by an irregular force of 25,000 Afghans on an isolated British outpost of 2500. The historical Malala encouraged the Jihadis by telling them that those who didn't die in battle were cowards and would shamed forever. Thousands of Afghans died (including Malala) in the battle and accomplished little more than delaying the already scheduled British departure from Afghanistan. The name represents everything that Afghanis and Pakistanis should be distancing themselves from in terms of self-destructive wars, pointless deaths and the encouragement of martyrdom.

The use of animation brings the whole thing down further and makes the title character even more unreal. The advertising I've seen for the film is also rather questionable. Selling the film through Nathan Lane ""Standing with Malala"" is just plain odd.

The flaws of the film are somewhat the flaws of Malala-mania itself. i.e. How has the situation in Pakistan been improved by moving Malala to Europe and making her into a celebrity? We have reached a point where we seem to solve problems by giving awards and minting new celebs.

One can appreciate the propaganda and marketing skills of a Davis Guggenheim. But as was also the case with ""Waiting for Superman"", his works are somewhat sterile and too much on ""message"". Every frame is about selling an idea. There are no unexpected or unplanned moments. The one positive thing to say about this film is that its message is much less harmful than the message of ""waiting for superman"" was.

Among the things that the film isn't going to tell anyone is that Pakistan is a theocracy. There is a religious court that reviews and can overturn any law for being inconsistent with Islam. Blasphemy carries the death penalty but the state rarely executes anyone because those accused of blasphemy either run for their lives or are lynched in the streets. But human rights and theocracy don't matter. Certainly not to Davis Guggenheim unless there is an alignment with the US government's goals.",1447200000,16,2826,5.027777777777778
7489316,4,B0176IELOY,"""He Named Me Malala"" (2015 release; 88 min.) is a documentary about Malala Yousafzai, the remarkable young lady from Pakistan, whom the Taliban tried to assassinate because she stood up for the right to an education for young girls. As the movie opens, we are told (via animation) where the name Malala comes from (an Afghani folk hero who encouraged/inspired the Afghan army in their battle against the UK). We then immediately switch to the footage of Malala's wounded body being treated after the Taliban's assassination attempt in October 2012--yes, almost 3 years ago to the date). The documentary then switches to ""Birmingham, England, 2013"", where we see Malala with her two brothers and her parents. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director David Guggenheim, best known for previous efforts such as Waiting for Superman, and It Might Get Loud. Here he tackles a difficult task, namely how to make an enticing documentary about a remarkable person, without coming across as simply wanting to 'glorify' that person. The answer, as it turns out, is quite simple: show us that person (in this case Malala) in their natural environment, and let us observe the REAL person. And then Guggenheim has another ace up his sleeve: he lets us catch glimpses (and more) of how the Taliban slowly but surely changes the Swat Valley in Pakistan, where Malala and her family lived. I must say, I was quite shocked at what I saw: the Taliban's brutality and determination knows no boundaries. As Malala (or was it her dad) observes at one point: ""For the Taliban, it is not about faith, it is about power"". Speaking of Malala's dad, it turns out he is quite remarkable well. I wondered why the movie wasn't simply called ""I Am Malala"" (her autobiography, from which the movie of course borrows), but now that I've seen it, it makes perfect sense, as this is a documentary not just about Malala but also very much about her dad. There is various remarkable archive footage in the documentary about the Taliban, her dad, and of course Malala herself. I must admit that I was worried how the makers of this documentary were going to fill an hour and a half in a way that would keep my attention. I shouldn't have worried. This is a moving documentary that, frankly, left me even more in awe of Malala than I already was. And to think this young lady is still only 18 years old as we speak! I am humbled and also a little inspired after seeing this.

""He Named Me Malala"" opened a few weeks ago, and the screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. That is a darn shame. I, for one, happen to think that ""He Named me Malala"" should be required viewing for all kids in the US grades 6 and up, and certainly I hope that many adults will see this too. ""He Named Me Malala"" is an inspired, and inspiring, documentary and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1445990400,42,3000,4.626641651031895

7489398,5,B0176IELOY,I think this was a wonderful story of the girl who stood up for herself and women of all races and backgrounds.  I just wished that she didn't have to suffer so greatly for the lesson she taught us all.  This was a courageous and heartwarming story of life after tragedy and the strong will to go on and fight for whats right.,1465430400,,326,4.158730158730159
7489399,2,B0176IELOY,"I'm in that unpopular camp of people who question the hoopla around Malala Yousufzai. Let me quell those who are already shouting: no, I don't think it's right that 15 year old girls get targeted and shot in the head because they campaign for the right of education for girls. That was a barbaric and brutal crime which ironically made the poor victim a star and gave her quite the platform to deliver her message. My problem is with the message - education for everyone? Then where is your mother in all this?
The use of animation in this film is more patronising than poetic license. Primary education goes beyond the storybooks of 6 year olds, and casually using pictures to ""explain"" why Malala's mother had no education (it was because she was willful and sold her schoolbooks for sweets!) leaves the question of why didn't her husband (who was so dedicated to education) ever bother filling in the gaps wide open. He apparently does agree with the conviction of his 14 year old bride that her husband completed her, so she didn't have to do anything aside from pop out babies.
Malala's father unwittingly presents himself as the ultimate stage parent - she may say she wasn't pushed by him in her voiceover, but the animation clearly shows him urging Malala into the room to speak for the BBC cameras. You get a clear picture of the man in his interview snippets: he was an ""unattractive boy"" with a stammer. who wanted to be the centre of attention and authority He found that being a teacher and promoting education was a way to get what he wanted, but obviously his daughter presented a much more eloquent and attractive package. And now, with the horrible shooting, she has a world stage, with him prominently in the background, mouthing the words as she speaks into the microphones.
My heart broke when they showed her going to Nigeria to address the kidnapping of schoolgirls by Boku Haram. Instead of standing in front of the cameras to address Boku Haram, pointing out that she too was a schoolgirl targeted by militants, and that Islam is not served by isolating and harming women, she merely quips that she too is 17, then goes on to harrangue the President into ""doing something"", never specifying what that may be. It would have been a much more powerful and personal statement to say ""when you take a girl from school it is like shooting her in the head"". That's a clean media bite with a lot more impact than ""I am Malala and you need to do something!""
Well dear, you certainly are Malala, but why don't you DO something, instead of just talk to the cameras? Like not hit your little brother (seriously, if a  male said ""I slap out of love"", would anyone accept that?) Or notice (like your other brother did) that your mother is isolated and lonely in Birmingham? How about including her in the family game of snap? No, you're too busy collecting your Nobel prize...",1465344000,,2886,4.614785992217898

The story is told in the context of historical events in Pakistan and dramatizes the ongoing struggle with extremists in her home area, the Swat Valley in the same country.",1465171200,,410,4.708333333333333

7489403,5,B0176IELOY,"I first watched ""He Named Me Malala"" while on an international flight- I was impressed that the airline carrier had such an interesting and meaningful film. ""He Named Me Malala"" is an excellent story about not only a girl and her experience with a disgruntled force (the Taliban), but the story of a motivated girl and her family. Malala is someone who was not motivated by being shot in the head. She was motivated to change global education before there attempted assassination and was shot as a result of being outspoken. I showed this video in my class as an alternative to reading a biography about Malala and the students enjoyed the way that the directors crossed between documentary footage and interviews and the cartoon representations of the stories she and her family told. This movie is suitable for viewers of all ages and is truly inspirational for anybody who wants to make a change in the world. Malala is willing to die for her cause and that still didn't stop her from pressing forward in her fight. I highly recommend this film.",1464912000,8,1048,4.73224043715847

7489408,4,B0176IELOY,"Topical director Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth; Waiting for Superman) serves up a rousing profile of Malala Yousafzai, the teenage Pakistani girl the Taliban tried to kill for her belief in education and equality. Contrasting her crusading public work with the fact that she is still a school kid struggling with homework, the film details the kinds of conditions her family was living under with the Taliban, the point being to highlight just how remarkable a person she was before being shot in the head.

Still bearing the wounds and injuries from the barbaric attack - there is life-long nerve damage and hearing loss - we watch as she continues fighting for her cause, her every appearance and utterance in favour of social progress a backhander to the oppressors she escaped.

It might not have been intended, but one of the unintended pleasures of watching the film is registering how Malala has become the worst possible nightmare to her failed murderers. Had they succeeded, she would have been a footnote in history, and a film would no doubt have been made telling the world about who she was and what she stood for.

Instead, her voice and message is now stronger and louder than it would otherwise have been had they not shot her. And as is made abundantly clear in the film, Malala has every intention of spending the rest of her life doing the exact opposite of what the Taliban wanted.
