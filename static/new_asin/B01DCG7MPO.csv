8755494,5,B01DCG7MPO,"I first saw this film at the New Mayfair in Philadelphia when I was nine years old, and being a kid, I was absolutely enthralled by it.  Adventure, action, suspense--what more could an impressionable kid ask for?  As an adult, I always wanted to see it again (for old time's sake), but I could never find a copy of it.  Until now.  Surprisingly, it still holds up after all this time. Cornel Wilde is at his swashbuckling best, and Jean Wallace is as smoldering as ever.  It was well worth the wait.  It remains an enjoyable movie, one that I will revisit from time to time.",1484352000,,574,4.367924528301887
8755495,2,B01DCG7MPO,"While it is easy to spot most movies that are released on DVD-R (due to branding like Warner Archive or Universal Vault), I found out about Shout Factory's DVD-R line the hard way after I received this disc, opened it, and discovered it was a DVD-R. Amazon really needs to place a more conspicuous notice about movies that are solely DVD-R titles, like changing the box at the top of the page that says this is a ""DVD"" -- that box should instead say ""DVD-R"".

I am adding this review as an extra warning to anyone who might have overlooked the one-line DVD-R notice like I did...",1476489600,2,579,4.411214953271028
8755496,4,B01DCG7MPO,"I'm a big fan of classic swashbucklers and ""Star of India"" is among the better ones.  It's not ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" or ""Scaramouche"" or ""The Mark of Zorro"", but it is a solid, quite-entertaining, and unusual period-adventure.

It's set in late 17th-C. France, with Cornel Wilde playing a minor noble (Pierre St. Laurent) returning to his estate after five years in the army only to find his property has been confiscated by the government and is now in the possession of Jean Wallace's Katrina, a Dutch partisan.  In order to win-back his estate, he agrees to steal the fabled sapphire ""The Star of India"" from Herbert Lom's corrupt and greedy Governor Narbonne.

It's unusual for a second-story caper to be part of a swashbuckler, and the period and setting are somewhat unusual too.  ""Star of India"" includes several brief but excellent sword duels, some capable music by Nino Rota, fine performances by Cornel Wilde and especially Herbert Lom, and a taut and engaging story.

Sadly the film has not been restored, and this Shout Factory DVD, while welcome, is somewhat disappointing.  Perhaps there are simply no better prints available, but the video quality on this DVD ranges from satisfactory to almost-impossible-to-see.  The film looks pretty good during the brightly-lit scenes, but there are many night scenes and these are frequently so muddy and dark that the figures themselves all-but vanish.  Still, this is the first proper DVD release of this admirable swashbuckler (and superior to my copy made from T.V.) so it is a pleasure to own, even at $20.",1474156800,6,1571,4.988505747126437
