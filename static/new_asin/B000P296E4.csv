2807377,2,B000P296E4,"I wanted to turn this movie off within the first ten minutes, and I should have. The movie is stupid. 30 minutes into it, you put the bad acting behind you only to realize that the editing of the movie is poor. At one point, I even heard the floor creaking as the actress walked and performed her lines. I'm sure that wasn't supposed to make the final cut. The ending was just completely ridiculous and a waste. Like a previous post says, you start seeing the credit and immediately wonder why.

Don't buy this movie, and only rent it with a free coupon (like I did) if you can't find anything else in the store.

I can't believe Tamala Jones, Bokeem Woodbine, and Lynn Whitfield would associate themselves with this crappy straight to video movie.

Lynn Whitfield has fallen hard from A Thin Line Between Love and Hate. And I pray that Tamala Jones hasn't type cast herself as a cheap hoe. She definitely won't be winning any awards for this role.",1189987200,,948,4.468208092485549
2807378,1,B000P296E4,"Hated it"" If your confused you'll love this film.
Sane people don't bother you'll probably barf. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it 0 stars. Tamala Jones and Lynn Whitfield must be going broke to stoop to such low levels. Am I thee only one that thought Lynn and Tamala would end up in bed together?",1189555200,2,315,4.266666666666667
2807379,1,B000P296E4,"I should have known that judging by these 3 reviews that I was in trouble.  I didn't even get past 10 mins in the movie before I decided that I couldn't take it anymore. This was a terrible waste of film.  I'm very disappointed here, I have a whole collection of black entertainment movies and I must say that this was one of the worst including Rendezvous.  Terrible, terrible acting and a complete waste of time!",1189123200,,414,4.421052631578948
2807380,1,B000P296E4,"I am a huge fan of Tamala Jones, and was very excited to see her in something new.  Unfortunately, as I watched Confessions of a Call Girl, I was very disappointed.  The script was either poorly written of all the actors delivered poorly.  Do Not Buy This Movie.  It's not worth renting or even watching on HBO or any other premium channel.  As a matter ot fact, wait until it runs on BET or TVOne.  Atleast then you'll get commercial breaks from the maddness.",1188691200,7,460,4.416666666666667
2807381,1,B000P296E4,I rented this movie with a free blockbuster coupon and after the first 30 seconds fast forwarded through 90% of it.  It has to be the worst movie that has ever been made.  Why would anyone do this movie.  Are these actors that broke!  They would get more respect flipping burgers than being attached to this movie.  Lynn Whitfield?!!!!!! Clifton Powell?!!!!! Whoever directed this movie must have been blackmailing them to do it. Watch the Giligan's Island marathon before you watch this.,1188172800,9,488,4.902439024390244
2807382,1,B000P296E4,"The poor, poor actors! This utter dog of a movie isn't held back by the acting, it's the dreadful script, low budget & lackluster direction that really hold it back. Of course, it could have surmounted even these obstacles if it at least presented copious amounts of gratuitous T&A as might be expected from the title, but regrettably, even that minor sop to the viewer was completely denied.

Run, do not walk, RUN away from this pitiful waste of time & money! Free is too high a price to pay for this dog, because you'll never get back the time wasted on watching this cinematic excrement!

& BTW, the ending not only doesn't make much sense, it sux on multiple levels. So you sit thru an excruciatingly bad flick hoping for a good wrapup, and are left staring at the screen when it's over, watching the credits wondering ""WHY? WHY WOULD ANYONE LET THEIR NAME BE ATTACHED TO THIS?""

In short, I dislike this film intensely. Hopefully, having taken part in it won't ruin the careers of the actors, some of whom were quite decent, despite the dreadful material they had to work with.",1186790400,18,1083,4.572164948453608
2807393,1,B000P296E4,I HATE THE WRITER PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR. HOW DARE THEY PUT TOGETHER SUCH FILTH. I AM PISSED AT ME FOR NOT TAKING HEED TO THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS. WTF. THE WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW. I AGREE NONE OF THESE ACTORS SHOULD PUT THIS EXCREMENT ON THEIR RESUME.

2807396,1,B000P296E4,"This could be seen as the African-American version of ""The Girlfriend Experience"". A call girl relates stories of her kinky clients to her psychoanalyst and tries to juggle her career with her home life with a husband who yells at her for missing PTA meetings.

The dialouge, script, acting, directing, and editing are below a college 101 project. Characters are thrown at you. At one point our call girl said she didn't accept tips and only accepted what she charged. Apparently the writer knows nothing about the escort service where everything is a tip. I was reluctant to write a review out of embarrassment of having to admit I watched this film.

F-bombs, sex, no nudity.",1338163200,,677,4.827586206896552

2807399,1,B000P296E4,"Like everyone else about 10 minutes into the movie my husband and I had the WTF look on our faces. This movie had some good actors and I cannot believe they appeared in this movie. If I were them I would not put this in my resume. This movie looks like it was home make and I swear in some parts they were ad libbing. Is it just me or is Tamala Jones headed toward porn? I told my husband he should take this movie to his job, leave it laying around and see if anyone will have enough nerve to pick it up and be tortured/punished like the rest of us. SHAME!!!",1235520000,,559,3.9557522123893807
2807400,4,B000P296E4,My confession is I'm probably the only one that liked the movie.  I thought it was good. There is some parts I thought could have been left out but overall I enjoyed.,1218844800,,166,4.1875
2807401,1,B000P296E4,"As good as some of these actors are, i cannot believe that they even agreed to this thing called a movie.  The script was poorly written and the acting was borderline ""atrocious"".  I cannot even believe that Lynn Whitfield even agreed to take part in this dreadful film. She's too good of an actress.  I don't mind supporting black films, but this is ridiculous! I'm considering just giving this film to somebody.  Hell,  it's not even worth trying to sell back to someone.",1191974400,,473,4.650602409638554
2807402,2,B000P296E4,This movie was nothing special.  I am a fan of many of the actors and that is why I brought it.  The script left something to be desired.,1190419200,,137,3.857142857142857
8188358,1,B000P296E4,"The movie was a complete waste of money and time. We barely made it through the first 10 minutes - cant get that time back. The acting was mediocre, the lighting and sound quality was for crap. Wish we could get a refund.",1523145600,,221,4.162790697674419

8188362,1,B000P296E4,"This movie is dreadful.  It has some wonderful actors but the script is ludicrously bad.  The director does not know how to establish a sense of place by using exterior shots.  The movie feels like it was filmed in a closet.  It tries to be sexy but only manages to be silly.  Even the sexual setups are laughable.  I know actors have to make a living but they should have got together collectively and told the producer-writer that his material was inferior.  I have seen thousands of movies, but this is about the worst movie I have ever seen.  Don't buy, rent or even accept this tripe as a gift.",1426636800,,599,4.381818181818182

8188367,2,B000P296E4,"Ok! Obviously it's not any of these actors greatest film. However it was entertaining. There are a few awkward moments, like how the floor creaked, the breathing in the mic and it seemed as if she was going to get it in during her therapy sessions. Lol! Not worth buying but I watched it on Netflix so I couldn't be too disappointed, had I spent my hard earned money... another story.",1363392000,,384,4.422535211267606
