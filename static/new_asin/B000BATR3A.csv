8084030,5,B000BATR3A,"Speechless. That's often how people found themselves when they came face-to-face with the astonishing wisdom of Jesus of Nazareth. From the learned rabbis in the temple whose jaws dropped open at the words of a 12-year-old Jesus, to the wilderness defeat of Satan who unsuccessfully tempted the Savior even after He had grown pale with hunger from a 40-day fast, this compelling and swiftly-moving video takes you on a remarkable tour of Jesus' early years. Walk where Jesus walked and you, too, will find yourself speechless as you witness these remarkable episodes take from the life of Jesus, The Son of God.
