47646,5,0783227272,I THINK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE REGARDLESS OF WHAT NATIONALITY YOU ARE. THIS MOVIE DETAILS THE TRUE HORROR THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS WENT THROUGH AT A TIME WHEN NO ONE WAS WILLING TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST SLAVERY.  THE MOVIE WAS A TRUE EYE OPENER TO WHAT AMERICA WANTS US TO FORGET.,920678400,,290,4.471698113207547
47647,1,0783227272,"well the acting was good, the production was good.  but what makes it bad.  the fact it was very historically  unreliable.  obviously they didn't really research their story well enough.  they just wanted to make a movie  that told this story.  some people wondered, why did this movie didn't get  nominated for best picture.  well, duh!!!",917740800,4,339,4.910714285714286
47648,5,0783227272,"AMISTAD is one of Steven Spielberg's most compelling stories, treating a very hard and almost unspeakable subject in a very vivid, yet not morbid way. Morgan Freeman's performance is, as usual, astounding, even if his  role is not as highlited as the rest of the cast, who do a superb task at  characterizations. Matthew McConaughey, in the tradition of ""A Time To  Kill"" delivers a performance which is proper of the GREAT actors. not  to mention Pete Postlethwaite and nomine Anthony Hopkins. The story is for  hard stomached people and it's beautifully handled. A MUST SEE. I can't  believe it didn't receive more Academy Award nominations, but well, you  really need to see this one. John Williams music score is also worth his  name, it had been a while since he rendered such a beautiful score.",913593600,,800,4.830882352941177
47649,5,0783227272,"It was a movie that helped you understand, cry and experience many different emotions. It also helped you to learn about history from a different view point. The writer, director and actors really did there  homework, because the movie made you feel, all the way through. The movie  took time to explore peoples true learning of another culture which they  didn't know nor understand. As the movie progessed they learned and grow to  Love, Respect, Appreciate and Understand each other for the beauty one  another had within. It also instilled the fact of never stop trying to  accomplish something if you really believe in what you are trying to  achieve. Everyone should have taken something from this movie one way or  another becuase it was one of the most inspirational films I have ever  seen. This movie didn't only explore race issues but also human issues and  the fact it was O.K. to believe in what your morales told you was right.  It's a shame that the Acedemy didn't reconize this Film for what it was,  ONE OF THE BEST EVER!!!!!!",913507200,,1044,4.707182320441989

47688,5,0783227272,"I remember watching this when it first came out. It was mandatory for a class I was in. I was floored then and didn't truly grasp some of the underlying messages at the time. Watching it again today gave some of the things being said a clearer meaning. 20 years ago, this was just another slave movie to me. It was just a class project. It was homework. I missed all of the lessons. I cried both times for different reasons. A fight for freedom and to be recognized. A fight still being fought today. That story took place in 1839...178 years ago. It's crazy that this is still the fight.",1509408000,,588,4.306306306306307
47699,5,0783227272,"This movie is still amazingly powerful 20 years later.  I saw it when it came out, and just rewatched it with my 15 yr old who is taking AP history this year.  Great portrait of the tensions pre-civil war, as well as the pain and horrors of the middle passage. There are some incredibly hard to watch bloody sections, but most of the film is courtroom and face to face drama.  core message still important today... about Freedom as the core human state and best vision of our nation being a recognition of the rights of individuals to that freedom as well as the importance of the division of power of the judicial, executive, and legislative branches.
Acting is great by all of cast.",1508025600,,684,4.5

47721,5,0783227272,"Amistad  inspires the viewer to treasure freedom and to be grateful to our forefathers for the commitment they made when declaring that all men have the right to pursue happiness and to live life to its fullest, free from tyranny and oppression. It also reveals just how cruel men can be when they no longer fear God.
As a Christian, I was enthralled with Spielbergs ability to show how one slaves struggle to understand his plight led him to peruse through a Bible and discover, via the pictures contained therein, the Gospel story. His description of Christs life, death and resurrection is inspiring. The power of this moment so enraptured my soul that I was held spellbound as he continued to share with Cinque the joys that would be theirs even if they were to die. For he believed that they too would ascend to heaven and live with Christ. [Please note that Spielberg fell short of saying that they needed to repent and be saved].
Amistad is a movie of epic proportions; yet it is not for everyone to see. It is rated R due to brutal violent scenes and for related nudity. I want to warn you, although the nude scenes are relevant to the story they do contain full frontal, male and female nudity.",1492041600,,1203,4.543778801843318

47817,5,0783227272,"As all Steven Spielberg films, this is excellent beyond description.  I've watched it before, and have the CD but my new computer ""wants"" an app to make all my movies play on it.  But this movie is worth paying for to watch over and over again.  The characterizations of each person in it, especially Cinque, is phenomenal.  You are there with the supposed slaves as they suffer every indignity that the slavers and those who ""claim"" ownership of them can dish out.  When Cinque cries out in court, ""Give us, us free!""  the emotion is just so raw that you want to kill every slaver and claimant of these unfortunate (it's worse than unfortunate) human beings.  Bravo to Matthew McConnaughy who is one of the heroes of the story, an attorney who sees that this is a case of chattels being owned or not owned, and he goes to town proving that the enslaved Africans were never owned by anyone but themselves.  It's a wonderful cast from Hopkins to Freeman, and a film that every child in the USA should watch when they are a teen, or a bit older even.  There are some scenes...",1470700800,2,1074,4.466666666666667
47818,4,0783227272,I revisited Amistad with this blu ray and enjoyed it more the second time around. While this isn't among Spielberg's best it is still a very engaging and well made firm. The story it tells is not always easy to watch but is one that should be told. Spielberg provides a fine balance between the physical and seemingly more refined social injustice being perpetrated on the men and women stolen from their homes and carried 1000s of miles away against their will. The director also provides a nice balance between abject reality and a presentation that keeps you entertained as the viewer learns about the inhumanity  we are capable of and the courage of some who refuse to be part of that cruelty. As for the bu ray picture it looks gorgeous - a big improvement over the DVD.,1470009600,,775,4.575539568345324

47831,5,0783227272,"As usual, Stephen Spielberg turns out a quality movie that takes us into the heart of the cause of freedom.  Excellent storyline that tells us of the Amistad rebellion of 1839 when African slaves killed the crew of their slave ship and ended up on trial in New England.  One of the events that turned the tide in the abolitionist movement and bringing the plight of slaves to Northerners, it cuts to the heart of our Revolution, and the meaning of liberty.  The black actors give quality performances, and rend our hearts with their sorrows.  Supporting them are Morgan Freeman, as a black abolitionist, Matthew McConaughey as their lawyer and Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams who ultimately takes their case to the Supreme Court.  Each of these are excellent in their portrayals.  Jeremy Northam in a minor role as one of the judges is very good as well.  Excellent movie.",1469232000,2,877,4.768211920529802

47835,4,0783227272,"I have never cried so hard in a movie before. It mostly takes place in the court room. Matthew McConnaughey is a lawyer who's trying to get the slaves ""free"" so they can go back to Africa. However, there are some scenes that are truly disgusting and heartbreaking. It really reminds you of the realness of slavery, and how horrid it was. I personally don't like sensationalized images of violence or abuse, I think they're unneccessary and problematic, but for the purposes of this film... I guess it was okay. Anyway, it's a great movie that adults (not children) should see. It's very gory and gruesome. My sister is 19 years old and is having nightmares so keep that in mind. It's only like 2 scenes but still, it's that bad. The anguish that these people experienced... No amount of reparations could ever cover over or heal the things we've done to God's children.",1466726400,3,869,4.64935064935065

47937,5,0783227272,"This raw, brutal and realist account of the slave trade is not for the faint hearted. Directed by Steven Spielberg and with a stellar cast comprising Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey and newcomer Djiman Housou, this film not only promises to be a winner it delivers. The film opens with a victory as enslaved Africans break free from the shackles that bind them together. After they slay all but 2 of their captors and take over the ship their promise of freedom is doomed when they land on the East American coastline.

Their trial is a bitter struggle for freedom. Despite their determined defence led by a young and enlightened lawyer (McConaughey) and freed coloured man (Freeman) they face strong opposition from their captors and pro-slave Americans. Spielberg inflicts the audience with confronting scenes of violence and the inhumanity that the slaves were subjected to on the ship, La Amistad. He further exposes mans inhumanity towards the slaves, who are treated as goods bought and sold for profit.

One of the films greatest strengths is that it tells the less known story of the slave trade where the initial captors are fellow Africans. From this point on they are goods processed by middle men to their common destination; a southern plantation. These slaves fight for freedom is also the catalyst for change that slave owners feared would herald the beginning of the end of slavery. After a gruelling and bitter fight the slaves win their freedom. Their struggle also shows how they influenced and changed the minds of the most powerful Americans during the 19th century.",1454803200,,1608,5.0187265917602994

Its a powerful drama that underscores the cruel and inhuman acts of converting innocent free men and women into slaves.  The movie features the courtroom drama of what it took to free these captives, and the role played by Adams.  Its a case of noblesse oblige at its very bestmen of high station helping those caught up in a living nightmare, of disinfecting a monstrous miscarriage of justice with the judicious light of truth.  Adams points to the Declaration of Independence as his clients greatest defenseAll men are created equal.

47975,5,0783227272,"Amistad, 1997 film

It begins at night, a man works to free himself from chains. Then others are freed. They attack the crew of the ship. Lightning flashes show the action. Men are killed in this fight. You hear splashes from bodies thrown into the sea! The freed slaves control the ship. Can they trust the navigator? They sail to the east by day. They approach land, a boat brings them ashore. An American Navy ship nears the Amistad (Friendship in Spanish). Can one man swim away? He tries, but he is taken aboard. These recaptured slaves are taken to prison. [The lack of dialogue makes this hard to follow.] Queen Isabella II of Spain hears the news. President Martin Van Buren doesnt want to get involved with forty-four slaves. New Haven Connecticut will deal with this problem.

The Court Hearing begins. The rebellious slaves are charge with piracy and murder. The US Secretary of State arrives, Spanish property must be returned. The Navy officers claim then as salvage. The owners claim they bought them in Havana, Cuba. The case is discussed for its legal technicalities. If they were illegally acquired the case is different; stolen goods must be returned. [Our society is controlled by laws and these technical questions.] The Anti-Slavery Society will defend these captives. [The comments seem designed for humor.] These captives do not understand Spanish. How can they communicate? Lawyer Baldwin searches the Amistad for evidence. He finds a map and papers. One is the manifest of a Portuguese slave trader who illegally captured them in Sierra Leone [Lion Mountain], a British protectorate where slavery is outlawed. [There was an International Treaty that banned the slave trade decades earlier.

This case is important for foreign and domestic politics. A decision can lead to Civil War. A new judge can affect the verdict more than dismissing the jury. They found a translator who can speak Mande and English. The new judge will not use a jury. Cinque tells how he killed a lion alone. Later he was netted by enemies. Captives are whipped on ship. [So too sailors in those days.] Sick captives are denied food, bodies are thrown overboard chained together. In Havana they are processed before being put up for sale. Then they are loaded on a ship for transport. Cinque speaks through a translator. The prosecutor points out that slavery exists in Africa. Its purpose is economic gain. The British Navy attacked the slave trade. He explains why fifty men were thrown overboard because of a food shortage! Set us free asks one captive.

One captive views the pictures in a book about Jesus Christ. The Judge announces his decision. The origin of the prisoners was misrepresented. Were they born in Africa? Hence they are stolen property and will be freed to return to their homes in Africa. The independence of the US courts keeps the countrys freedom. One southerner predicts future bad effects on the country. This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court by the US President. Baldwin writes to John Quincy Adams for help; he argues before the Supreme Court on the importance of freedom for people. All men are created equal. Any Civil War will be the last battle of the Revolution. The Supreme Court finds for the defendants; as free men they had the right to fight for their freedom. Afterwards British troops free the captured Africans from the slave fortress in Sierra Leone. The freed captives are taken back to Sierra Leone. The defeat of the Confederates ended any question of compensation to Spain. When Cinque returned home he found his family gone. This is an educational movie, not entertainment.",1445990400,,3630,4.926470588235294

47998,1,0783227272,"...a laughably-contrived exchange of dialogue in which an African character actually tells a jewish character words to the effect of: he's ""sorry that the jewish people have suffered so much."" Really? This poor guy is locked-up due to killing a bunch of slavers in an attempt to free himself and he's going to take time to get weepy about oppression of jews? Seems Spielberg wanted to steer any conversation (of the time) away from the heavy and obvious jewish involvement in slave trafficking and as well as use. I credit him for continuing the barrage of self pity, but he needs to mask that crap a little better. That's right, go ahead and research their role in the slave trade for yourself.

Matthew McCawnuh-huh-ay (I'll spell his name correctly when he drops his fake southern drawl) and Morgan Freeman have absolutely no apparent role in this film. I'm serious, especially when juxtaposed with Anthony Hopkins's terrific portrayal of J.Q. Adams. The scenes trying to feature Freeman and McCawnuhwhatevs were boring, meandering and weak. Had Spielberg simply gone with a more authentic telling, it would have made for a better film. Hopkins flies to the rescue in the end because it was a great character played by a (at the time) great actor. However, the contrivance of myths surrounding a period of history like this is insulting. I would suggest Spielberg stick with the facts, but Schindler's List proved he is more interested in manipulating audiences with cartoonish, overly-fictionalized villains, so why would this film be any different.",1440201600,2,1553,5.042801556420233

The acting was superb, especially by Djimon Hounsou. He has one line in particular about his ancestors that the writing just blew me away.

48047,5,0783227272,"This is a beautiful movie, & very important for those who want to understand & learn American history.

 Basic plot: Historical drama about African prisoners kidnapped from their native home, and revolt against their captors killing them in the process.  A US Navy vessel captures the revolting prisoners and brings them to the US for trial with the charges of murder.  Since they were not born property and slaves on a plantation, and simply kidnapped they are legally not slaves which is the argument for their defense.

My favorite aspect of this movie is the awesome portrayal of President John-Quincy Adams, who along with his Father were some of the most remarkable, brilliant, and important Presidents in American history.  Like his father, John Quincy was a strong intellectual proponent of human freedom and dignity in a dark and cruel world that did not always treat the less fortunate with any of those ideals.

Spielberg is a mixed bag of a film maker for me personally, on one hand he has made some of the best movies and television shows including his adaptations of ""Jurassic Park"", & ""Jaws"", and I also list ""Indiana Jones"", ""The Duel"", ""The Goonies"", 80's tv show ""Amazing Stories"", ""Roger Rabbit"", ""Catch me if you can"", ""Lincoln"", and of course ""Saving Private Ryan"" among his absolute best work; but he also in turn has made some real flops plus he loves to shove his political beliefs onto the American audience and treats Americans as if they need to be lectured or as if they are stupid.

Morgan Freeman, Matthew Mochanahy, & obviously Anthony Hopkins are brilliant in this movie and make it worth one's time to see.  But instead Spielberg used his inappropriate influence on America's political power brokers to push ""Schiendler's List"" onto some public schools which, even though that is also a powerful movie, is grossly negative because ""SL"" was an historical drama and analysis of European history, not necessarily an American story like ""Private Ryan"" and ""Amistad"" are.

If I were to choose Amistad merely on its opening scene, I would be completely justified! The opening scene is like walking into an enormous structure, albeit man-made or a natural phenomenon and then standing in front of it in awe! His imagination captures all of our imaginations! There are many films where we think, I would have never thought of doing that because its too unusual and not in my sensibility but with Spielberg you think why didn't I think of that; it has the right emotion, the right point of view and beautiful imagery and given time I could have taken it there, but most filmmakers don't and Spielberg does! The story of African slaves who cause mutiny on a Spanish ship is part of a great and disturbing piece of American history and Spielberg gives it every sense of humanity, tragedy and cinematic scope it deserves!",1431561600,,965,4.616279069767442

Something didn't seem quite right about the story so I researched a little and found that there were some interesting differences between the movie and historical records. Eric Foner wrote a pretty good paper on the movie. You can probably find that with an internet search. I've always thought that ""white savior"" stories should be considered condescending to the ""benefactor"" group. Usually, they portray a heroic Caucasian who risks all to come to the rescue of mistreated minorities. I guess it's more entertaining and makes people feel good about themselves because they can identify with the hero on some level like: ""That's just what I would've done."" That said, the acting was great. The movie was, overall, very entertaining. As long as you don't let yourself think that you're watching true history, this can be a very enjoyable movie.",1430265600,,922,5.072368421052632

48174,2,0783227272,"Don't worry.  My dislike of the film is not because I'm a myopic Ayn Rand reading half wit who's touched in the head.  Nor am I intentionally trying to offend anyone by showing callousness to the subject matter.  The reason I didn't like this movie is because its tone was schizophrenic.

The worst thing about this movie is the music.  For the purpose of this review, I tried to imagine I had seen a special director's cut where the orchestra was edited out entirely.  But I just can't.  The music was so overpowering and obnoxious, that I thought at first I forgot to close an internet page and some commercial was autoplaying.  Whenever President Adams was on screen, that suffocating music was playing and I couldn't focus on the dialog.  The things he said reminded me of every other sleazy politician, but I guess from the music he was actually a sagacious humanist who walked on water as he sings to the bluebirds like Snow White.  It may seem like a minor thing, but it was more off putting than the laugh track on The Big Bang Theory!

The scenes on the ship were disturbing.  I didn't see the point in being so explicit.  It really makes me wonder about the kind of person who intentionally seeks movies like this out.  I'd expect that stuff from indie films because the sole purpose of many of those movies is to make you feel horrible.  So to go from this sappy music with John Adams tending flowers to a twenty minute scene of a slaughterhouse more depraved than American Horror Story... I think Spielberg needed to choose which type of movie he wanted.  Perhaps other people appreciated the juxtaposition of 'civilized' debate to unimaginable barbarity, but for me it just didn't work.  I liked how MacCouneghey's character tried to work within the legal system to do what was humane (he treated the slaves as property from a legal perspective).  And I liked the different perspectives.  I especially liked how the individual slaves had actual personalities and how they conceptualized the people in the courtroom.  But I had enough when the main slave stood up and said 'give us free, give us free, give us free' accompanied by an orchestra AND a choir.  I was surprised to learn Amistad didn't win the academy award for best picture, nor was it nominated.  As I looked at the films that did win or were at least nominated, it occurred to me that I didn't even like at least half the movies on the list.  It almost seems to me that the less subtle the emotional cues and the more heavy handed the message, the more popular the movie.  Honestly, this film seemed more like Zemeckis than the director of Schindler's list.  I'm sure I'll be having nightmares from that scene on the ship for some time.",1430179200,5,2713,4.590436590436591

A great cast led by Anthony Hopkins,Morgan Freeman, Matthew McConaughey & introducing Djimon Hounsou. Should have won an oscar but Steven had a problem getting respect early in his career. Why? Because he made movies that exposed some of history's less than stellar moments. This movie centers on the very foundation of the American justice system.

If Spielberg can't be counted on to view the blacks as more than just so much cargo---much like the slave traders, navy captors, Queen Isabella of Spain, the courts, etc---then why should the audience view them as otherwise?  In fact, I found myself viewing the legal argument---of who has superior property rights to the blacks---as more compelling than the drama of whether they would achieve freedom; I was actually rooting for the slave traders to get possession and make good on their investment.",1408838400,,618,5.118811881188119

48343,5,0783227272,"Yet another brilliant, moving and unforgetable film from Director - Steven Speilburg. This is a true and historical account about slave trading and the Africans that wanted to go back to their own continent, lifestyle and tribal freedom. This magnificent film from Dream Works Pictures in association with HBO Pictures, chronicles the unconscionable theft and geographic displacement of Africans... away from their homeland, and graphically depicts their horrific and brutal journey: Physically, emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, historically and even legally, thereafter. It engages the viewer in a historical legal battle of such monumental porportions that former President John Quincy Adams (the son of America's 2nd President - John Adams), addressed the Supreme Court in his representation of them and their rights. Are all men free? Are all men equal? Or are some men, merchandize to be bought and sold like cattle and property? Veteran Actors - Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman, lead the distinguished cast which includes, Matthew McConaughey and Djimon Hounsou. This riveting film which comes to it's audience in color on a single, DVD-disc and runs approximately 2-hours and 35-minutes in widescreen format, is brilliant. And it was so well done in story content and presentation, that it earned no less than 4 Academy Award nominations: Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Hopkins); Best Cinematography; Best Music and Best Costume design. But, back in the day, when their were no Oscar nominations to be had, the true, unsung, hero..., in this gripping drama is not the African Leader, the former President - John Quicy Adams, the Attorney who represented them in a Lower Court or even, an emancipated Negro (Morgan Freeman), who secretly publishes and distributes pamphlets and newspapers about the anti-slavery, Abolition Movement. The courageous hero..., who set everything into legal motion, is actually a young, honest, Catholic, Judge, who... had his entire future ahead of him and everything to lose including his reputation and livelihood, if he didn't play the political and judicial puppet too: Queen Isabella II of Spain or succumb to the demands of the then - President of the United States, Martin Van Buren. This righteous, honorable, Judge does the unheard of, unexpected and unimaginable, amidst the social, political and economic climate of that day. What he said and did, was not only historic but he essentially put the entire American Judicial System, on trial. What did he do? Well..., let me put it to you, this way: It made legal history, set in motion unprecidented social and much needed reforms, changed the Anti-Slavery Movement, swayed public opinion, implemented true justice and restored faith in America's legal system. This superb and compelling movie is engrossing, factual and historical, and you will undoubtedly, be very moved. It is worthy of your viewing time and a definite keeper for your home, DVD library, collection. Because... if anything, this big-screen, true-life depiction, should have won an Oscar or two if not for content, then for the sheer value, equality and triumph of a human life!

48356,4,0783227272,"Its curious how some of Steven Spielbergs movies are occasionally dumped on because of the directors past successes. Empire of the Sun contained lyrical, powerful moments that still rank with Spielbergs most indelible cinematic images, yet many critics came down hard on the movie in the wake of the inferior The Color Purple, which managed multiple Oscar nominations and widespread critical praise. The same phenomenon happened again after the release of Schindlers List, where many critics seemed unnecessarily harsh on AMISTAD, Spielbergs underrated 1997 film that rode a storm of controversy over the changing of factual events and a plagiarism lawsuit that was ultimately withdrawn.

amistadNot that the drama  centering on a real 1839 slave ship mutiny and the subsequent trial of those slaves in New England after their vessel, La Amistad, lands in American waters  is without its flaws, but the fact is that Amistad is a well-acted, compelling, and thoroughly entertaining account of early American history. In fact, Id rank it among Spielbergs best films from the later portion of his career.

Spielberg does a masterful job in juggling the local Connecticut trial of the slaves and their leader, Cinque (the dynamic Djimon Hounsou)  who are defended by ragged, inexperienced lawyer Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey)  with the national interest in the case, as represented by President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) and ex-President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins). The slaves plight, as they go through trial after trial in court, is effectively retold through flashbacks which illustrate the Gold Coast trading as few films have done before; just as adept is Spielberg and screenwriter David Franzonis illustration of how pressure from Spain, England, and the Southern states all factor into the national U.S. debate on what was, relatively speaking, a minor incident at the time.

For the sake of illustrating all of these incidents, Spielbergs film takes some liberties with specific facts, but they never alter the historical relevance of the actual events, and, in fact, make many worthwhile points about slavery, politics, and even religion along the way. Most surprising is how the movie avoids heavy-handed parallels to modern life, often believably conveying various characters instead of portraying them as broadly painted stereotypes. If some of the protagonists, such as Van Buren and Morgan Freemans fictitious abolitionist Theodore Joadson, are given short-shrift in relation to the other characters, its most likely because Spielberg had to trim the running time down to a manageable 2 hours, which nevertheless goes by quickly in the final cut.

Filmed extensively in Newport and Providence, R.I., as well as Boston and Mystic, Ct., the movie has a flavorful location atmosphere akin to the filmmakers earliest efforts, complimented nicely by Janusz Kaminskis often evocative cinematography. John Williamss excellent score usually enhances the drama, though Anthony Hopkinss climactic court summation is overscored to the point of irritation (try, the music doesnt stop once during its 11 minute duration!). We know how noble Quincy Adams was in his intentions, so the music adds absolutely nothing to the sequence  even in its restrained trumpet lines (performed by Tim Morrison), Williamss score here is something of an annoyance, since it continually punctuates this is important thematic passages. The sole detriment to an otherwise superb Williams score, its the only heavy-handed element in an often poetic and satisfying picture.

Making its Blu-Ray debut from Paramount, Amistad has been treated to a fine 1080p AVC encoded transfer with 5.1 DTS MA audio. Extras include the trailer and a half-hour vintage Making Of.",1400112000,,3762,5.437392795883362

The final scenes, from the conversation in Adams' greenhouse to his presentation in the Supreme Court are among the most memorable in American film to me, enhanced by having retired Justice harry Blackmun play the role of Chief Justice and read the decision.  And a first-rate John Williams score, complemented by fine sound mixing, is another salient feature.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a good story well told, especially those who are interested in U.S. history, and those who enjoy the craft of film-making at its finest.",1390867200,2,835,4.8936170212765955
48375,3,0783227272,"If the concept of this movie interests you, then I think you will find this movie interesting.  Its 2 hours and 35 minutes long, some may find it tedious, with too much dialogue and a scene from Anthony Hopkins that seems too long in retrospect.  The premise is during the 1860s a slave ship has been overtaken by the slaves and the ship ends up on the East Coast of America where the legality of the slaves independence comes into question.  The movie is a battle between the government/slave-owners who want them returned to their masters and the abolitionists/lawyer's efforts to set them free.  At times, the sentimentality towards the slaves will seem corny and and hollywood-ish, but overall its a moving film that will keep most interested.

The name of the ship is La Amistad and the movie is based on a book.  The recognizable actors in this film are Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman plays a self-righteous person(what else would you expect from him).  Djimon Hounsou  plays the slave who leads the revolt; this was an early role for him.

As the movie progresses you get a brief glimpse into life at the time.  America seems to be painted in a way that makes it essentially look like how England would have looked at the time.  The architecture and characters could have inhabited London the way it appears.  I would say that there's a structure to this in the sense that the movie is about the importance of eliminating slavery in America, to not carry over the traditions of bondage from Europe into America.

Like other movies revolving around slavery, you know who the evil powers are and you see the good side trying to question and reform the institutions that support slavery.  McConaughey plays an idealistic lawyer who echoes the abolitionist sentiment of the time.  Anthony Hopkins plays John Quincy Adams who is eventually called into to help the slave's cause.  He gives a speech so passionate and moving that helps the slaves earn their freedom.

The audience is treated to all the important ideas regarding anti-slavery, but in other ways it feels like a glossed-over look at the time period in question.  We only see the main characters, we never how how the general population lives or how their interactions with other races plays into the overall theme of the movie.  Its as though everything the good guys did was done in a bubble of dialogue.  Still, the movie represents real events and its important to understand that the victories, no matter how small, will matter.

I would recommend this movie to anyone that has an interest in the subject or wants to study history through movies since it does take its subject seriously.  I wouldn't say its great, but the movie keeps the story going.  In terms of a climax, there's not much direction the movie can go, either the slaves go free or don't; but that's not the point, the point is their struggle for freedom and struggle for freedom in general.",1389657600,,2952,4.745098039215686

48377,4,0783227272,"Steven Spielberg's ""Amistad"" 1997) is a film about a celebrated event in American history involving the fate of Africans on a Spanish slave ship ""La Amistad"" that came into the possession of the United States in 1839. I had some knowledge of the incident but wanted to see the movie after reading a new biography of John Quincy Adams,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Quincy-Adams-American-Visionary/dp/0061915416/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Quincy Adams: American Visionary</a>.  Late in life while serving as a Congressman from Massachusetts, Adams served as co-counsel for the Africans in proceedings before the United States Supreme Court. He spoke eloquently for their freedom.

The events surrounding La Amistad are complex and were necessarily simplified for dramatic purposes in the movie.  The film begins in the hold of the ship as a group of captured Africans succeed in breaking their chains.  They kill most of the Spanish crew but leave the two ship owners alive to sail the ship back to Africa. The owners sail the ship to the American coast instead. The United States captures the ship and begins legal proceedings to determine what is to be done with what appear to be the mutinous slaves, the ship, and the two owners.  The government of Spain claims a right to the slaves based in part on treaties.  Great Britain wants the slaves freed. The United States through its waffling president at the time, Martin Van Buren, wants to support Spain.

The case is tried twice in Federal courts in New Haven Connecticut with the slaves represented by a rising young lawyer, Roger Baldwin. In both trials, Baldwin is able to show that the Africans were not escaped slaves but rather had been illegally captured and carried off from Sierra Leone. When the United States appeals the case to the Supreme Court, John Quincy Adams agrees to assist in the defense of the Africans. The Supreme Court rules in their favor, 8-1.

A popular movie such as ""Amistad"" is not held out as a documentary but is instead a mix of entertainment and history. With the basic background knowledge I brought to the film, I thought it generally succeeded as both, particularly as entertainment. The movie runs over 2.5 hours and held my attention throughout even though much of it is set in courtrooms. The movie includes some excellent special effects in scenery, including the initial rebellion on board the ""Amistad"", the scenes of cruelty and suffering on board an earlier slaver the ""Tecora"" which had abducted the prisoners from Africa, and the destruction of the Sierra Leone ""slave fortress"" by a British schooner at the end of the film. The acting is well done throughout with Anthony Hopkins capturing the character of the aged John Quincy Adams.  Dijimon Honsou portrays Cinque, the leader of the captured Africans. Matthew McConaugey is effective as the young, tough minded attorney Baldwin while Peter Posthalwaite portrays the United States attorney, Holabird. Morgan Freeman plays an escaped slave, Theodore Joadson, who works with an abolitionist group in the defense of the case.  The then former Supreme Court Justice, Harry Blackmun has a brief role portraying Justice Joseph Story, who delivered the opinion in the ""Amistad"" case.

On a historical level, Hopkins' crusty, curmudgeonly John Quincy Adams did a good job capturing both what I understand of his character and his basic role in the ""Amistad"" proceedings. For the rest, the movie should be taken as accurate only in its broadest sense as involving the fate of the captured Africans, the legal proceedings, and the background in slavery. The character of Joadson, for example, is fictitious, and the threat in the film of Senator John Calhoun that the South would secede in the event of a court ruling in favor of the Africans is drawn from air. The proceeding was more about the outlawed international slave trade than about domestic slavery in the United States. The Court that ruled in favor of freedom for the Africans consisted largely of Southerners. Although a great oversimplification, the film properly emphasized the role the case ultimately assumed in the conflict over slavery, the importance of the case in the protection of separation of powers, and John Quincy Adams' role in the defense. Adams' appearance and presentation before the Court were courageous and invaluable. The legal arguments on which the Africans secured their freedom were developed and presented by Baldwin, in both the lower courts and the Supreme Court, as the film properly shows. With its inaccuracies, ""Amistad"" offers a valuable popular approach to this historical incident for the overwhelming number of people who otherwise would have little or no knowledge. Perhaps the film serves as encouragement to some to pursue a historical interest further through reading.

I learned a great deal from reading the varied Amazon reviews of ""Amistad"". Many reviewers thoroughly liked the film.  Other reviewers were critical of various aspects of the entertainment or aesthetic value of the movie while still others were critical of its presentation of history. I liked the movie and think it valuable for entertainment and basic history. With guidance and discussion, the film could serve as a simple effective teaching tool for secondary school students.

48399,4,0783227272,"Story-telling in which Steven Spielberg deals with and cinematically enhances historical events to great effect--as usual.

It seems he likes to make film stories that are about emotionally freighted (and sometimes prejudicial) issues--like extra-terrestrial visits to earth, the Holocaust of World War II, and slavery (which is really about Freedom), which is his subject here.

One of the most touching and tenderly effective scenes in this movie is the one in which one of the imprisoned Africans, unable to read or understand English, discerns by means of a beautifully illustrated Bible the story of FREEDOM persecuted in Jesus, who is apparently the ""sunlight-accompanied"" (shekinah-glowing) God of these strangers amongst whom he and his fellow-accused ""slaves"" anticipate being put to death.  It is a wonder that certain American powers have not legally condemned Spielberg's movie for its friendly reference to the Christian religion in that scene.  If such a jailhouse event were occurring in actuality today, it's conceivable that a prisoner might not be allowed to have a Bible on government property.

In other scenes, Spielberg is not so kind to the issue of Christianity, though.  Twice he has the Africans say about the Christians who follow them around and pray for them that these are ""miserable-looking people.""  (And they do appear as grim, black-cloaked, pale-faced creatures.)  It seems as if Spielberg tries to balance out his positive and negative references to Christianity.

Overall, with regard to the Spanish involvement in the slave trade, he presents an entirely negative impression of Spain and Spaniards, creating especially unfavorable imagery relating to Queen Isabella II.

I noticed that I viewed the entire movie with my radar alert for each sign of prejudicial treatment of issues of any kind in the movie.  Besides those regarding slavery, the prejudicial views for and against the Christian religion, most specifically Catholicism (which ultimately came off looking pretty good in the person of the Catholic judge), and Spanish power (abuse of) were very evident and deliberately presented.

Other reviewers of the movie on Amazon also mentioned mainly their reactions to issues of prejudice raised by the movie.  It clearly seems to be Spielberg's purpose to use his movies to create attitudes in viewers for or against certain concepts and issues.

With some of Spielberg's movies, I remind myself that I think it's a good idea to be aware of how an artist is manipulating historical facts and their presentation to create certain dramatic effects and/or emotional convictions, and then to think about and discover to what extent I agree with him.

Spielberg does make movie masterpieces that are emotionally and intellectually interesting and memorable.

There's a lot of love and beauty in this movie, ""Amistad.""  Not only in the ideas and the victory of justice and freedom that are depicted, but also in the striking physical beauty of the film.  Even though so much of the subject matter is horrid and grim, there is a lot of beauty in the photography and film-work.

So, I think this is chiefly a work of love--about a much-to-be-desired brotherhood of man--and it is also a fine work of art.  An excellent, very worthwhile movie--although I guess I could have desired a positive balance allowing some amelioration of the presentation so entirely against Spain-and-Spaniards.",1371427200,,3423,5.280442804428044

Instead, a composite character attorney is misunderstood by one of the defendants and rejected. Also, the fact that one of the defendants,Sengbe Pieh (later known in the United States as Joseph Cinqu), learned enough English in jail to write a moving plea to Adams for assistance is totally ignored.

48444,5,0783227272,"Every time I see Djimon Hounsou's character interrupt courtroom proceedings to cry out for freedom in very broken English, I get a lump in my throat.  Spielberg is a master at pulling very strong emotions out of his audiences, and AMISTAD is no exception.  With extremely unsettling and disquieting backstory, this film is basically a courtroom drama based (loosely) on an actual slave mutiny aboard a slave ship, a mutiny where most of the crew are killed.  The Spanish ship 'Amistad' is captured by the U.S. Navy in American waters, and the Africans on board, knowing not a word of English, are imprisoned and charged with murder--plus a court must determine actual ownership of the alleged slaves (who are not slaves at all; by the mid-19th century slaves must be born into slavery according to American statutes, and the 'Amistad's' ""cargo"" was kidnapped directly from west Africa).  The trial creates a national sensation in America, already teetering on the brink of Civil War, with President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) pulling all the strings he can to make the problem quietly go away.  It's a riveting trial, ultimately going all the way to the Supreme Court, followed by an unforgettable ending.

The cast is the very best, including Hounsou (who has been remarkable in every role I've seen him play), Morgan Freeman as fictional abolitionist Theodore Joadson, the late Pete Postlethwaite as formidable prosecutor Holabird, and Stellan Skarsgard as abolitionist Tappan.  I'll even give props (although I rarely do) to Matthew McConaughey playing down-on-his-luck defense attorney Roger Baldwin; here, the actor is anything but annoying.  But special kudos go to the sensational Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams.  When Baldwin and Joadson persuade the great orator to argue their case before the Supreme Court, it summons one of the most compelling scenes in the entire film.  Warning:  Spielberg is exceptionally graphic with his depictions of what takes place on the 'Amistad', and it is difficult to watch, but sets the stage for the powerful drama that ensues.  Spielberg has an impressive cache of remarkable films, and AMISTAD is one of them.

48446,4,0783227272,"I heard a lot about this film when it was new. As I understand it, there were some very mixed reviews. Some said it was based on a true story, but didn't stick close enough. Some said it was too close, including pretty graphic violence and nakedness, even frontal nudity. But people don't demurely turn their thighs to cover their privates when they are being tossed overboard.

I agree that it was indeed violent, but then it was an extraordinarily violent true story. All of the violence was pertinent, although it might not have needed to be quite so graphic in spots.

There's no doubt it's confusing. A significant aspect of the story is that the Africans did not know any language but their own, and nobody even tried to find an interpreter until a surprisingly long way into the story.

The historical story is basic: In 1839, a slave ship called Amistad was taken over by the slaves and all but two of the whites on board were killed. Those two were ordered (by sign language, mostly) to return the ship to Africa so the people could return to their families. Instead the ship was recaptured and the prisoners were taken to New England.

Oddly enough, the first legal issue was whose property they were. Quite a few people laid claim to them. It took a long time for anyone to realize that according to then-current law, they were only slaves if they had been born into slavery. Therefore, quite a few people had an interest in proving that they came from Cuba, and had indeed been born slaves. However, their clever attorney Roger Baldwin (played rather impishly by Matthew McConaughey) and his abolitionist allies Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard) and Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) set out to prove that they came from Africa.

Once an interpreter was finally found, Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) told the harrowing tale of how they had been captured by rival tribes and sold to Spanish slave-traders in Sierra Leone. A large ""slave fortress"" was doing a brisk illegal business. The brutality they experienced was almost literally unbelievable, and the slimy Secretary of State John Forsyth tries to prove that it is not believable. I was laughing at the casting here. Forsyth is played by David Paymer, whom I remembered as an equally slimy pornographer in a 1987 episode of ""21 Jump Street.""

The entire case became the most complicated legal mess you can possibly imagine. In fact, it ended up in the Supreme Court, more because of the politics of the situation than for any other reason. Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) was running for re-election, and he needed the votes of the slave-holding south.

Baldwin and Joadson, with the help of Cinque, manage to persuade John Quincey Adams (Anthony Hopkins) to argue their case before the Supreme Court. (Forsyth quips that he will be remembered mostly for his middle name, which is of course the truth.) Adams' help was important partly because a majority of the Justices were themselves southern slave-holders.

It's a very brutal story, rather brutally told. Still, it is of very important historical significance, and on the whole, Director Steven Spielberg did a good job. Good, not great. It is as good as it is mostly due to the actors I have mentioned, plus one more: Judge Coglin, who was hand-picked by the President to replace the original trial judge for reasons I won't go into here, was played by Jeremy Northam. I do hope to see more of him; he's quite a charming fellow.",1336953600,,3446,4.78956228956229

Adrian Law

  Steven Spielberg mastery of film, without a doubt, shines through in the Amistad. He does immerse the audience with the characters, when he could tell the entire story just by showing the built up emotion in Cinqu's eyes. However, in a move to appeal more to American audiences, he altered the Amistad court case as a turning point in the fight against domestic slavery and not about the Atlantic Slave Trade. This film may be a masterpiece in its own right, and indeed as a drama it pulls no punches, but historically there are some holes and misconceptions.
  Historically, the Amistad was a court case that gained international attention because three of the world's powers, Spain, Great Britain and the United States were involved. A great deal of pressure and political maneuvering ensured surrounding the 51 Africans, with the British enforcing their treaty with Spain regarding the blocking of illegal slave trade south of the equator while the United States Supreme Court became the stage on which the US did not honor Spanish wishes and the US Constitution's supremacy clause used to support the Spanish argument for the return of the slaves. John Quincy Adams did not, as shown in the film, make an argument based on life liberty and justice, but instead pointed out that the US Government had no right to interfere with court proceedings and therefore political needs did not dictate justice. In the end, this famous court case is only significant concerning executive power over the judicial branch and the international role in the Supreme Court. The Amistad had little to do with ticking off the Southern senators or Van Buren's efforts in gaining favor with the slave-owners. The American Civil war wasn't even on the horizon till two decades later. Even though it was hailed as a victory by the abolitionists and the Africans were indeed returned to Africa in defiance of Spanish wishes, the Amistad was a dispute about international treaties and not about human rights.
  That said, however, the film does more justice in portraying the cruelty of the slave trade and its institution by illegal traders and slave fortresses. One unforgettable scene is when the crew of the slave ship Tecora, realizing that some of the slaves may not survive the trip, tie a dozen weak and sick Africans by their ankles to an anchor, and the camera pans down as one by one they sink to the bottom, struggling to free themselves. The actors, especially Djimon Hounsou as Cinqu, can move the audience just by the emotion in their voice and the tears welling up in their eyes as they recount traumatic experiences. If you decide to watch this film, keep in mind that the story is unfaithful to history, but as a story about the question of slavery and all the complications that tied down America pre-Civil War, then it is one of the best films out there, made to be enjoyed.",1332720000,,2907,4.837022132796781

48450,5,0783227272,"In the year that saw an Oscar-winning film about another notorious ship brought to the big screen, Steven Spielberg, the adoptive father of a few children of African-American descent, gave the world what was most likely a lesser-known story of U.S.-African relations, written by David Franzoni,and produced by Debbie Allen.
  I first learned the story of Sengbe Pei or Cinque(here played very charismatically, passionately, and intelligently by Djimon Hounsu) and the case of the Spanish ship La Amistad in a college history course. My professor mentioned many aspects of the horrors of slavery shown in the film, including suicide by jumping ship as a form of resistance. The audience is not spared the graphic scenes of brutal beatings and rapes of those on board, nor the sight of slaves being drowned.
 Amid  the mournful a capella sound of a female vocalist, which sets the dark tone for much of the film, a chained Cinque, trapped in the bottom of the Amistad with other captives, has been busy picking a nail from  a wooden beam, working despite the fact that his hands are bleeding--a nail that  will be used to pick the lock of the chains that bind him, tipping the hand of fate not only for himself, but for all the captors.
 That rainy night, Cinque breaks open a box of weapons and arms the captors, who do battle with the crew, killing most of them, although two Africans are shot to death in the struggle as well.
  The Spanish sea men Ruiz(Geno Silva) and Montes(John Ortiz) are left alive and at swordpoint, Cinque demands they steer the ship back to Africa, but after an odd encounter with  another ship in which  the Africans now on deck hide and restrain Ruiz and Montes while observing the other ship's passengers enjoying an elegant soiree, the Amistad goes ashore on American soil, and at some point the Africans taken into custody in New England.
 Although there could have been more subtitles for more of the Africans' commentary, Spielberg brilliantly captures the feeling of fear and alienation the Africans must have had as they experienced a whole new world in which most appear hostile to them, and even others of their race who don't understand them. Razaaq Adoti, as Yamba, is Cinque's friend and henchman. It is mostly through their dialogue that we come to understand their mindset during their incarceration.
 Taking their case after they are charged with murder for killing most of their captors is a young attorney named Roger Sherman Baldwin(Matthew McConaughey).
 A major dispute is which party has claim to these mutineers, and also whether they actually were from Africa, as Ruiz and Montez have falsified information about them, claiming they were from Cuba. British Lieutenants Meade(Darren E, Burrows), and Gedney(Ralph Brown),who seized the Amistad after the mutiny, also make claims in this case.
 As Cuba, the place where the captives were to be taken, is a Spanish colony, a young Queen Isabella II(Anna Paquin), who ages from nine to eleven during the two-year period of this story(1839-'41), acting upon the counsel of her advisor, also makes a claim that the slaves were hers, illustrating the point of why a spoiled, isolated, out-of-touch child, a slave to the machinations of more savvy adults should not be embroiled in political intrigues, much less sit on a throne.
 Morgan Freeman plays the fictional Theodore Joadson, who appears to have been based loosely on Frederick Douglas, a prominent voice in the abolitionist movement. Stellan Skarsgaard is his fellow abolitionist, Taffin.
 Nigel Hawthorne is an out-of-touch President Martin Van Buren, who seems perplexed about the significance of the Amistad case. Peter Postelthwaite plays the formidable prosecuting attorney, Holabird.
 We see how Joadson and Baldwin learn to communicate with the prisoners by learning to count in Cinque's spoken Mende with the help of a linguist, and counting aloud in the African marketplace to attract the attention of a native speaker who can interpret for them. They attract one Ensign Covey(Chiwetel Ejiofor), who successfully breaks the language barrier, easing the way to justice as the case opens before one Judge Juttson(Allen Rich).
 There are many setbacks for the defense as the threats against Baldwin mount. One moment of relevance is when the captives show the court they know enough English to make it clear to all that they want their freedom.
 Gradually Juttson is replaced by the younger Judge Coglin(Jeremy Northam), whom, as Secretary John Forsyth(David Paymer) notes, keeps silent about his own Catholic heritage to avoid his own persecution in a Protestant environment.
 There is a stirring moment as Yamba discusses the contents of a picture Bible a missionary handed him with Cinque. As they view and discuss the images of the man others know as Jesus, the judge who will tip the balance in their favor is alone before a cross in a chapel, reciting beautiful Latin breviaries as only Jeremy Northam can.
 At the state level, Baldwin initially triumphs. As Ruiz and Montez claims are found to be fraudulent, they are taken into custody for slave trading before the court and their former captives, as the captives' freedom is initially declared.
 But a setback at the national level angers Cinque, and increases his frustration in dealing with with a vast and complex system in the already alien and alienating world in which he and other Amistad captives have found themselves.
 On his third attempt in so doing, Baldwin finally procures the aid of former  President John Quincy Adams(a nuanced performance by Anthony Hopkins), who finally  takes a stand on the issue of slavery, bringing the story to its dramatic conclusion.
 While it has been noted that Adams never met the Amistad captives, the dramatic license taken is very effective. It shows Adams not shunning what he learns from Cinque, but incorporating it into his oration before the Supreme Court and winning the case.
  The dramatic scenes of a journey home in conjunction to John Williams' score play on a viewer's emotions, as do the powerful scenes of destruction of the slave fortress at Lomboko in Cinque's native Sierra Leone, and the counterbalance of the spoiled little girl-Queen, and the battle in the long-anticipated and dreaded American Civil War that brought her claim in the Amistad case to an end.
 As is often the case with historical drama, more than a few liberties are taken,  but a tale of how America returned to Africa at least a few of her children  at such an unlikely time in history is highly noteworthy.",1330473600,,6561,5.001838235294118
48451,4,0783227272,"One thing you can say about Steven Spielberg is that his films are always compelling.  When he steps away from fantasy and takes on serious subject matter he seems to remember that he must keep the audience involved.  In this historical drama, a slave ship sailing from Cuba to the U.S. in 1839 is overtaken by the slaves.  Their journey began in western Africa where they were captured and taken to the Cuban slave market.  During the rebellion numerous crew members are killed by the captives.  The ship is eventually captured by the U. S. Navy and the slaves are taken to Washington for their fate to be determined by the courts.  Several entities made claim to the ""property"" including 11 year old Queen Isabella II (a young Anna Paquin) of Spain, the naval officers who snagged the ship and the ""owners"" who purchased the slaves in Havana.  With a fine performance by a then unknown Dijimon Hounsou as the leader of the slaves, the film documents the hellish events the slaves endured on their passage.  This includes a memorable scene where 50 are stripped naked, tied to a net full of rocks and sunk into the sea.  This because the ship masters underestimated the needed rations for the trip.

Much of the drama takes place in the courtroom however.  An attorney (Matthew McConaughey) is hired by a group of abolitionists led by Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard).  After winning a couple early decisions to set the slaves free and return them to the native country, Baldwin (McConaughey) enlists the help of elderly former president John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins).  The current president Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) manages to circumvent the previous court and refer the matter to the Supreme Court for final resolution.  He is concerned that in 1839 the states remain divided over the slave issue.  The southern states still have legal slavery, the northern states do not.  He does not want to go down in history as the president who allowed the inevitable civil war.

Hopkins has one great scene (and an Oscar nomination) where he makes an impassioned speech before the court.  He has a couple points of historical significance.  First, the slaves were in fact free in their home country and were illegally kidnapped and brought to America.  Secondly, he prevailed upon the independence of the court from the executive and legislative branch.  Even though 7 of the 9 justices were from the South, Adams prevailed and the slaves were returned to their homeland.

48467,4,0783227272,"Amistad tells the story of an African group illegally captured and sold into slavery during the years following the dissolution of the international slave trade. This particular group was highly unusual in that it actually managed to break free of its chains, overthrow those in charge of the ship, and order that it be returned to Africa. Unfortunately for the Africans, they are the victims of deception once again, as the ship is sailed into American shores instead. It lands near Long Island, and the Africans are immediately arrested and taken to Connecticut, where their fate is to be determined from within the legal system. Their case passes through various different courts, but they are successful at every turn; along the way, they receive assistance from various legal and linguistic aides, abolitionists, and even ex-President John Quincy Adams. Their freedom is eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, and they are sent back home to Africa. I rather enjoyed the film, finding it to be a harrowing, emotionally engaging, and surprisingly accurate historical drama.

 The film was released in 1997, produced by Debbie Allen and Steven Spielberg, and distributed by DreamWorks. Steven Spielberg is the director; Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, and Morgan Freeman, among others, are the stars. As previously stated, it is a historical drama based on actual events; according to the interviews with the director and stars included on the DVD, much attention was paid to making it as accurate and true-to-life as possible. Of course, it is also a Hollywood film, and therefore a dramatization; to this end, it includes elements of suspense, action, and other traditional Hollywood trappings. As such, it was designed to appeal both to fans of serious historical dramas and to more general moviegoers.

 On account of the factors just mentioned, the film does manage to be entertaining, despite its serious overtones and devotion to historical accuracy. It manages to hold one's attention throughout, even though it is longer than the average film and deals with more complex and less conventionally appealing subject matter. Elements of both pedagogy and entertainment are present in the film, and neither, thankfully, ever manages to get in the way of the other. Even so, it becomes clear upon viewing the aforementioned interviews, and indeed the film itself, that a key underlying them for Spielberg and his cohorts was depicting a relatively unknown incident in American history as accurately and sympathetically as possible within the confines of a Hollywood film. Proof of this exists in the attention to detail present in, for example, the choice of sets and the painstaking depiction of language.

 Amistad depicts several cultures and subcultures. For example, although fleetingly, it shows glimpses of African tribal culture during the flashback scenes in which Cinqu, the tribal leader, reflects back upon his life at home before he was captured. More significantly, it portrays, in graphic and nearly excruciating detail, what it may have been like to be a prisoner onboard a slave ship. Spielberg refuses to flinch with these scenes, choosing instead to depict them with an intensity that ranges from moving to horrifying. Knowing, as the audience does, that the Africans memorialized in the film were unusual in that their experience was less trying than most others only serves to reinforce the truly ghastly horrors of the slave trade. Although elements of these scenes are inevitably based on conjecture, they are notable for their striking apparent realism; for the viewer to see fellow human beings treated in such a savage and inhumane manner truly serves to set the Africans up as genuinely human and wholly sympathetic characters. As Roger Ebert notes, this is one of the primary strengths of the film:  ""What is most valuable about ""Amistad"" is the way it provides faces and names for its African characters, whom the movies so often make into faceless victims."" Not surprisingly, the film casts these Africans in an extremely positive light; they are shown to be an essentially innocent people, with a legitimate and vibrant culture of their own, who are unfairly and tragically captured and sold into slavery for no real or just reason. Few viewers, one assumes, will disagree with this presentation - on the basis of either history or the film. That said, Amistad does depict a darker side of the Africans; the dramatic insurrection scene that opens the film, for example, shows them to be quite brutal and uncompromising in their takeover of the ship, however justified such an overthrow may have been. It leaves the task of deciding whether or not this is morally right up to the viewer; it passes no judgments of its own. More significantly, it shows one undeniable but rarely mentioned fact of the slave trade; Europeans could not have undertaken it without help from Africans. The sad reality of this unfortunate state of affairs is made dramatically clear during the scene in which Cinqu is captured by rival Africans and handed over to slavers. These Africans, then, are portrayed both as the centerpiece of a dominant culture in their native area of Africa and as a subculture - that of imported slaves - in America.

 The film also portrays American culture, or at least part of it, as it stood in 1840. It shows little of how everyday people lived or of what constitued popular culture at the time - but this, of course, is not the focus of the movie. What it does show, and in surprisingly vivid detail, is what it may have been like to live in America circa 1840. This is accomplished via the highly detailed and very realistic sets that are featured throughout the film. In contrast to the Africans, American society is depicted very ambivalently; one could even argue, quite plausibly, that it is cast in a generally negative light. For example, it shows American politics to be largely corrupt. Thus, President Van Buren is shown as a bumbling fool completely lacking in all moral integrity who cares only about being re-elected; this image is even further reinforced when the film has him illegally and unconscionably interfere with the trial by using his political clout to replace the judge with one he believes will be his crony. The film also emphasizes the evils of slavery, which still existed in the country at the time, thereby taking another shot at 1840 American society. Even so, it does show some bright spots in the nation, such as the abolitionist movement and the existence of at least one incorruptible politician in the person of John Quincy Adams. On the whole, though, it can be unequivocally said that the allegedly superior American culture is contrasted throughout the film with African culture, and the latter generally comes across as less arrogant and hypocritical.

 This last discussion touches upon several of the film's other major themes - political corruption, the role of slavery in American society and national economy, lingering differences between the North and South, etc. The main theme of the movie, though, is undoubtedly freedom. It argues, very powerfully and convincingly, that freedom is a natural right; thus, it uses the very moving and illustrative saga of the captured Africans to make a philosophical point that, at film's end, few would be willing to refute. All of the film's underlying themes are brought to bear on this one central point, and it manages to perform the difficult task of arguing its case quite well without ever becoming overly didactic.

 I was impressed with the film and found viewing it an enjoyable and worthwhile experience. It is very well done overall and contains a wealth of fine acting, cinematography, and storytelling. Amistad is truly one of those rare films that is both entertaining and informative; in this, it clearly accomplishes its goal of being a significant and meaningful film without sacrificing popular appeal. It comes highly recommended for anyone who enjoys historical dramas or wants to learn more about the issues explored in the film without having to resort to a scholarly resource. Due to the film's admirable historical accuracy, much can be gleaned from it about both the slavery issue and 1840 American society and culture. Anyone who seeks knowledge in these areas, or simply wishes to enjoy a good film, will find Amistad engaging and thoroughly valuable.",1260921600,,8440,5.08080808080808

 This movie relies on the viewer having a strong sense of entitlement and thus being aloof of the less than subtle insults aimed at caucasians.

Because ""you either do something or you don't"", the African leader sagely informs us.

The film provides for a very good description of the pre-Civil War era along with people and events slowly tearing at American society and by extension the country as whole.

Anthony Hopkins, Morgan Freeman, Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Hounsou, and the rest of the cast, have carried out their performances very well

48475,4,0783227272,"Historically accurate this in your ganeckdagazoink. It is like the intellectuals who pan 'Troy', either 1. because its not accurate historically,or 2. because it was a travesty to have Brad Pitt play the greatest warrior ever. That is neither here nor there, however magic comes sometimes when you least expect it. I believe firmly, that in the movie industry it is hardly ever about how talented you are, you can always, for the most part, hone the craft, but more about luck, as most professional actors (or struggling ones for that matter) will tell you. The right place, the right time, the right look, the exact moment you make a gesture in the hallway waiting for your 3 minutes to read two lines for a Dial Soap commercial and the casting director just happens to see your brow go up a certain distinct way, and Monday morning your agent calls you and you have the gig. Luck, hmmm it came crawling my way one brutal winter in New England.

It was around five months after my return from film school in Manhattan, a good one too, I was arriving at 4:25 in the morning in my town I had lived in for 2 some-ard years, for make-up. Of all the movies I could have been in, of all the places I could have been that year, (I travel a lot), of all the names I would have loved to have graced the screen with, and of every director I would have love to have sat in awe and watched, I, (and it could have been eternal bliss from there if it were the last), was going to be in a Speilberg film. Clich? Eh? Well I certainly hope so.

It is very hard to detail to words the feeling on my skin, the way my shirt felt against my chest that day, the way my heart would actually sing as it beat inside my cocoon, walking up the long spiral staircase in the old city hall building which was made into a court house, knowing that on top of that building, somewhere in the oogles of background extras and the crew, lights and stands and sticks and gaffers and goffers and the like, I was in my element. I didn't tell anyone I went to film school, and that I had my DVD collection at home alphabatized by directors last name (lol), what did it matter, it didn't. But I Knew them all. Janusz Kaminski was on set, (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan cinematographer), Kate Capeshaw (Indiana Jones) Speilberg's wife was there, Debbie Allen, and her husband Norm Nixon, of course Matt McConaughey (who was unbelievably professional, it was stunning, as I was watching him in character prepare before entering for a movement take; wow it was as if he had left the physical and whoosh to another place al together, now that is preparing), Morgan Freeman (who was utterly rude to EVERYONE including the poor make up girl), David Paymer (Searching for Bobby Fischer) Stellan Skarsgard, and of course, mostly standing on the ledge overlooking Newport Harbor with a cig swinging from his fingers, was the elegantly voiced, Pete Postlethwaite. Oh Pete, I thought to myself, my shining star, that wonderful bliss that I was so young routing for you at the Oscars for In The Name of the Father, how much I was passionate about his craft.

I will never forget one scene, and if you are familiar with the movie you can relate, when Jjimon Hounsou, the leader of the Africans slaves aboard La Amistad, has to rise above the orderly law and back and forth rebutalls, to say in English, 'I'm free, I'm free'. We must have did that take 30 or 40 times, probably five or six hours, and the mood in the courthouse was so intense, so amazing that everyone was simply stunned by the power of a few words, and when he had all the camera angles he needed and Djimon finally nailed it, Kate was in tears as was Debbie Allen and Speilberg, in a room filled with a silent hush that seemed to last for days, was the solitary word of 'wow'.

As a principle extra for two months, not only in RI but also in CT, there was one moment in particular I would like to share with you, when the AD jetted all the non principals out of the courthouse, I somehow remained behind. My beard was designed in a pork chop way, where I sort of lingered behind with the principles and no one shoed me anywhere, and while Janusz and his crew reset the lighting for the next take, Matthew walked over to him in a poster size rolled tube, and he opened it slowly from the top, placed the white top cylinder on the old courthouse table, and opened a fairly large print of 'Empire of the Sun.' I almost gasped aloud. That too, was my favorite film of all time, that too ss what set me west young man, go west, and eventually to waiting tables and studying the craft at night waiting for the big break back in NY. He handed Steven a black sharpee and he signed away on the top left corner. I wonder all these years later, nearly 10 years plus, if it sits atop his mantle in his home in the hills or somewhere in the country. I was there that day, I was with some of the most brilliant minds in the film industry. I too, wonder if Matthew was inspired to be an actor from Empire. The Speilberg haters (which is the most ludicrous bunch of whack-jobs imaginable) can have their spew and vitriol, but being part of something tangible like that, and having someone like Steven as a mentor, albeit unknowing my whole life, made it something I will never forget for the rest of my life.

Amistad alone tells a story, and one that is very difficult to relate to its audience. The courtroom scenes are tiresome and rough for a lot of movie goers, but if you can look past that for just one moment and see the raw, pinnacle acting that only someone that directs giants could produce and the immaculate word salad at the end of the film, that only Hopkins could achieve. The brutal, opening sequence alone, is enough to set you up for the often jaded slowness the movie can provide, but all in all, there are scenes where life itself can spew forth and invigorate all of us, like it did so many years ago, for myself,",1208390400,5,5942,4.364046973803071

I am often opposed to remakes, but this story would deserve a competent serious new version without the cute little Hollywood cliches and without the music that envelops everything in sugar coating.
I am not sure which parts of the tale are historic and which are added by the script writer or Spielberg. I find it hard to believe in John Quincy Hopkins, and if the real man did make this speech, it was a great one and would have deserved to be acted without the horrible sentimental soundtrack. The whole part is such a terrible cliche, it almost does not matter if it is historically correct. The esthetic conventions of inferior Hollywood productions should be banned from serious subjects.

48478,3,0783227272,"Over the years since this film first came out it has received something of a love hate relationship with viewers. Amazon have provided their own review filled with the sneers and sarcasm that have resulted more from critics knee jerk pandering to the masses than serious critical review.  Others have pushed the old ""political correct"" Motive behind the film (For anyone who doesn't know, political correct roughly translates as ""Something I disagree with, usually something I deem to be either left wing regardless of whether it is or not)

What should not be taken for granted however is the level of emotion still felt by many African Americans regarding the trans Atlantic slave trade.  I first watched this film at a cinema in the United States and can recall (I assume) a black American walking out during the film with tears in his eyes clearly emotionally distressed at what he was seeing (It was during the scene describing the trans Atlantic journey when many were whipped, beaten and the sick thrown overboard.

I seriously doubt however, that Spielburg under estimated the feelings of black Americans and while this film is certainly not of the quality of Schindler's List it certainly isn't ET.  To make that kind of comparison is frankly absurd.  My guess is Spielberg went for something based loosely on historical fact similar to Saving Private Ryan.

While the argument that the characters may well be one dimensional I assume a previous reviewer did not bother the watch the film before he reviewed it and declared it ""politically correct"" because the film clearly shows that Cinque was kidnapped by Africans and sold to Europeans.

Spielberg does try to show the diversity of ethnic groups such as Muslims and Animist, one man seems to be taken by Christianity (a convert no less in such harsh circumstances!) The men speak in different languages and at times are argumentative amongst themselves (A comparison can be made to the imprisonment of Jews during WW2 and the disputes that arose between Jews of various nationalities)

Speilburg tries hard.  He shows that the Spanish and Portuguese were the main participants in the slave trade (The British admiral giving evidence and yes, Britian did send out ships to attack Spanish and Portuguese slave traders) The conflict within the United States itself regarding slavery and the divide between north and a south that still relied heavily on a slave work force.

Morgan Freedman provides us with the character of a black man born in the United States with no concept of slavery himself and no direct links with Africa.  An abolishinsist non the less.

Yes, the film may be less than accurate in regards to specific events but I believe Speilburg was attempting to provide the viewer with an overview of what slavery was and the struggle against it.",1205798400,,2819,4.947033898305085
48479,5,0783227272,"AMISTAD is as relevant today as it was when it first came out in 1997. In at least one respect it is now even more relevant.

As most viewers realize early in this film, it was not designed to provide audiences with pleasant entertainment. Rather, it is a kind of didactic drama, serving--like Euripides' ancient Greek play THE TROJAN WOMEN (415 B.C.E.) and the recent George Clooney film SYRIANA (2005)--both as a reminder of a nation's flawed past actions and as a plea to be better  in the future. Insofar as racism and racial violence are still thriving in our country--often encouraged by some politicians and pundits in low places--AMISTAD's main message is still needed, and the film is still an effective means of awakening people to the injustice of granting some citizens a place of special privilege while other citizens are kept subordinate.

By a fluke of historical fate, however, this film can draw our attention to things that were not in the forefront of its makers' minds at that time. Viewing AMISTAD in the winter of 2008, I was struck by the repulsive actions of President Martin Van Buren, who hungered so strongly for a second term that he repeatedly tried to deny justice to the wronged men and women of the slave ship--even intervening to have their favorable verdict overturned by the Supreme Court (which at that time seemed to be stacked in his favor by a margin of 7 to 2). Do our presidents ever commit such immoral acts nowadays? Does anyone of any party doubt it? And do the members of our Supreme Court ever make their decisions on the basis of ""party loyalty"" despite what our laws and our Constitution may say to the contrary? Are we ever in danger of having a majority of such false justices making vital, life-altering decisions? Has such a thing happened within living memory? Does anyone of any party doubt this? Does anyone believe that President Van Buren was the very last president to try to manipulate matters as far as laws and the separation of our government's branches are concerned? If any of us disagree on the answers to these questions, it is only about the names of the guilty parties and/or the relative degrees of their guilt.

And yet, within this film we are shown that, on the issue of human rights and ""the belief that all men are created equal,"" 8 of the 9 justices of the Supreme Court in Van Buren's day had the intelligence and integrity to vote to uphold what our Founding Fathers had promised our citizens and had stated about human beings everywhere. And while I found many other parts of this film deeply moving--the parts which had been scripted, directed, and acted to press my emotional buttons on the issues of slavery and the rights of all human beings--in my recent viewing of this film I was also very deeply moved by the sight of our nation's much criticized Supreme Court doing the right thing. In line with the other messages of the film, this suggests that our citizens have a right to expect AND a duty to demand no less from our present Supreme Court as well as from all future Supreme Courts.

The British politician Edmund Burke is supposed to have said, ""All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men [and good women] to do nothing."" Although no one has ever been able to verify where or when he may have said this--or whether some other person said it who has been wrongly forgotten--it is still a valid maxim, one well worth remembering whenever we are tempted to let someone else do our thinking or fighting for us.

And now, coming down off my soapbox, here is one tiny piece of art trivia: the biblical illustrations shown in AMISTAD were done by a French artist named Gustav Dor. And although the main action of the film takes place between 1839 and 1841, Dor was not born until 1832, and his biblical illustrations were not published until 1865 in French Bibles--and were published three or four years later in English Bibles. Does this destroy any of the fabric of the film? No, of course not. Does it make me think any the less of this film? Certainly not. Its central message remains intact--and its new and unintended message about our presidents and our courts needing constant vigilance to keep them working properly is not affected in the least.",1203811200,9,4254,4.6427622841965475

Where the film falters is when Spielberg takes ""dramatic license"". Putting it simply, when he lies.

The slavetraders were lousy human beings without a doubt but they didn't dump half the slaves in the ocean.

Those of us who toured the ship saw the shackles that held the people and learned how they worked.  We saw the area in which the people were held.  A gentleman from Sierra Leone who claimed to be a descendant of ""Cinque"" explained some of the history of the slave trade and of the Amistad people.  In all, the tour was chilling because I suppose I had never been brought so close to the experiences of those men and women who were brought to this country as slaves.  I wanted to see the film and learn more.

Of course the film is fictionalized, and maybe one has to see the ship ""in real life"" to better appreciate the film.  Still, since I saw it, and since I saw the ship replica, I've tried to find out more about this history, both on the internet and in the library.  I've also thought about the fact that some issues raised in the film are still relevant today.  The issue of the independent judiciary is one.

Steven Spielberg does have an optimistic take on the story here, as he does in most of his films.  Sometimes, life doesn't bring happy endings.

Not only has AMISTAD stood the test of time,but it has aged like a wonderful wine does. AMAZING GRACE points out that the slave trade in England was abolished in 1807,and European countries followed suit,as well as the U.S. in following years. What AMISTAD brings to the table is that it's story occured historically in 1839!!!!Just because laws and treaties were enacted did not mean that the slave trade was not still being done. The other point that the miniseries ROOTS also pointed out that,like in AMISTAD,Africa itself had civil war brewing within and that Africans sold other Africans in order to gain support,amunition and power. A most valuable film to be watched and heeded by all. I am so sorry I waited nine years to revisit it.

How sad that the film,though acknowledged with four Academy Award nominations,was not rewarded,for what ever reason, with a single win! How Anthony Hopkins and composer John Williams and director Steven Spielberg were not honoured is still an amazement. Another excellent companion film about the slave trade would be A RESPECTABLE TRADE and the 70 minute documentary also entitled AMISTAD.Still,no film has ever conveyed so graphically what slaves aboard the ships endured;thank Steven Spielberg,who also brought us SCHINDLER'S LIST, for keeping us always alerted to the injustices in this world,HOLLYWOODIZED OR NOT!!!!!!!",1173225600,,1474,5.219409282700422

Additionally, Matthew McConaughey turns in an inert performance which shows him to be fantastically miscast in movies such as this.

However --- there are enough things, for me at least, to merit a marginal 4-star rating, not the least of which is Hopkins' excellent portrayal of the most crotchety US president EVER, the esteemed JQ Adams.  Also, whatever the other liberties that may have been taken with historical fact, the scenes aboard La Amistad during the passage ring with the sort of truth which cannot easily be discounted by hair-splitters.

The case challenged America's fresh ideas as embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution: in a country which recently fought for the freedom of its own white citizens, yet allowed Negro slavery, could Negroes themselves fight for freedom before becoming owned by U.S. citizens?

48496,5,0783227272,"All criticism aside, one of the most powerful statements against slavery and man's inhumanity towards his fellow man. It seems that when it comes to slavery and America's shameful past, we try to ignore that it ever happened. Too few films have portrayed the slave trade or the continued illegal slave trade, such as that of Spain's, that was still taking place then. No one wants to be reminded of that dark past, but we tend to stand tall concerning other issues, ""lest we forget"". And yes, Cinque was a man without a language in this foreign land, like any of us would have been. Hats off to Mr. Spielberg, for one of his most powerful works to date.",1161648000,4,653,4.495798319327731
48497,4,0783227272,"What is the price one will pay for freedom ripped and seized from? It is a scenario that is presented by Stephen Spielberg's ""Amistad""; when something so essential such as freedom is taken; the fight to regain it should understandably not be governed by rules. Freedom is a right all men and women are entitled to at birth or at least that is what all men and women should be entitled to. And for the pursuit of freedom one has to take into account drastic measures to regain it. Such is the case when over 40 men sold into slavery revolted against their owners off the coast of Cuba . Led by Sengbe Pieh or Cinque, the Africans eventually found themselves just off of Long Island . Their capture by U.S. authorities and their quarantine as their fate was put in limbo as abolitionists argued their case.

As Cinque, relative newcomer Dijimon Hounsou portrays the leader of 40 men stripped of manhood and dignity. Hounsou further displays Cinque's strength in character which earned him strong conviction from the esteemed John Quincy Adams. The supporting cast, more notably Morgan Freeman and Matthew McConaughey round out strong players in the mix of things. Freeman's acting especially when he is confronted with the conditions of the Amistad slave ship is breathtaking.

The justification of what men (for this example) would do for freedom is a strong argument John Quincy Adams gets across to the Supreme Court in the Amistad case argued February 22 - March 2, 1840. Anthony Hopkins brilliantly transforms himself into the aged politician and proves experience coupled with belief in a cause can bring out the very best out of an individual otherwise considered inactive.

Sometimes lost in the shuffle of a tense period in U.S. History is the mutiny of the Amistad and the ruling to return the crew of West Africans back to their homeland. Certainly it is a chapter many never heard about in grade school to high school history books, but a key event that helped mold support for the cause of the abolition of slavery.",1158537600,,2026,4.782857142857143
48498,5,0783227272,"This film really struck deep with me. I'll find myself in some situation, and one or another line Adams' final speech will come drifting back to me. It has settled somehow in my inner repertoire of quotes... ""I am that I am"", ""And miles to go before I sleep"", ""To be or not to be"",... And yes... ""Give us the courage to do what is right, and if it means civil war, then let it come.""

I can do the whole thing. The movie even motivated me to go through the Supreme Court proceedings and look up the original.

If someone would argue that the film is superficial, doesn't really 'get' racism, then explain to me please why the question, ""However, why are we here?"" keeps haunting me? Tell me that? ""How is it that a simple plain property issue finds itself so ennobled as to be argued before the Supreme Court of the United States of America?"" What motivates us really to countenance what goes on in this world, and to persist in lying about it even to ourselves? ""Why are we here?""

Why Are we here?

""We hold these truths to be self-evident..."" Whether we intended it or not, those were the principles which settled in our hearts and upon which we resolved to try to found a nation. And no one can really doubt that this is the big issue that we must resolve before we can truly claim to have accomplished our mission. It is the task which God has put before us as a people... the last battle in the War of Independence is indeed the struggle which we still face within our own borders. The struggle has evolved and changed face even in my lifetime, but it persists.

""This is the most important case ever to come before this court, for what it in fact concerns is the very nature of man.""

It's not some 60s flick about how bad we whites have been. It runs deeper than that. It's about the very nature of man.",1144972800,3,1811,4.280701754385965
48499,4,0783227272,"As with all movies about history, I review them from the perspective of the history teacher and leave all of the other particulars to the other reviewers. In this case, however, I'd like to address the Amazon review (written by Dave McCoy) as well. McCoy states that the director (noneother than Steven Speilberg) feels compelled ""to entertain with beautiful images and contrived emotion . . . [and] . . . cheapens his grandiose motives and simplifies slavery, treating it as cut- and-dry genre piece. Characters are easy Hollywood stereotypes--'villains' like the Spanish sailors or zealous abolitionists are drawn one-dimensionally and sneered upon."" For the record, I'll say that I agree wholeheartedly---but in this case, an excellent movie still unfolds and a story that SHOULD be told is told! Also, let me address a fellow reviewer's (Leon Washington) remark that those who slam this movie are guilty of racism. I don't necessarily think that those who give this movie bad reviews are categorically racist, but I do think they may be missing the ""big picture"" here. Alright, let's get on with the review.

High school and college history teachers---this movie is a must see for numerous reasons. For one, Anthony Hopkins does a superb job (as expected) of portraying John Quincy Adams. His performance is worth the price of admission alone. Yet, many students may find his performance a bit boring. Herein lies the problem with the real history---this movie is based upon a real-life courtroom drama. Much of the movie is set within the courtroom and let's face it, most high school students will typically begin yawning. This is not necessarily so, however,  with ""Amistad."" You see, it's the very fact that Speilberg DOES create sensationalism---""Hollywood moments"" if you will---that saves this movie from being a yawner! It may be true that some characters are oversimplified villains, but all good movies have some sort of antagonist.

Many reviewers have trouble with Speilberg's portrayal of the events aboard the infamous slaveship, Secora. I disagree completely. This is a realistic depiction of what could happen on any given day aboard a ""slaver."" ****Note**** While riveting with its ""shock and awe,"" young viewers (under 12) probably should not see these horrific scenes for the usual reasons.

There's no doubt that Speilberg takes a bit of poetic license when presenting this film. Who cares? This is a story that should be told and Speilberg does so excellently. Even political science students should see this since it also serves as a testimony of U.S. diplomacy and foreign policy during the mid-nineteenth century.

High school teachers, please don't exclude this great movie from your list based upon the negative reviews of critics. You'll be glad you showed it and your students will be all the wiser! Please show it within it's relative time period as well. In other words, don't just show it during Black History Month.

So, what should students LEARN from this movie?

First --- Students should be able to parallel the events of this drama with the events that would soon unfold in America (Civil War). In other words, they should be able to see how the decision of the Supreme Court would have been a victory for abolitionists and a defeat for pro-slavery advocates like John Calhoun.

Second --- Students should discuss the Monroe Doctrine in relation to our treaty with Spain. Does the U.S. violate her treaty, or are we following our own self-revealed destiny?

Third --- Students should use this movie as support for a discussion of how Great Britain attempted to enforce its ban on slavery and how Spain and Portugal attempted to continue slavery in their colonies.",1143244800,6,3704,5.068965517241379

As usual, the directing is emotional and heart-wrenching and the cinematography is beautiful. The acting on all accounts is wonderful and captivates the essence of the time. The actual story of the Amistad, slavery, and the personal view through Cinque is powerfully moving. This is a movie not to be missed that pack an emotional punch for any who watch it.

Just a day later, They are captured and bought to spain to stand trial on murder charges. A lot of very talented actors are in this movie. But, I truly think that Spielberg went too far with this one. I never thought i would be saying this about a movie, But this movie was literally too hard to swallow for me. It was much too violent, Much too ugly, And the story also fails to tell of what the supposed ''hero'' of the film did just a year after he was freed from slavery. Cinque actually became a slave trader himself. To me, That doesn't make Cinque a hero, That makes Cinque a traitor, As well as a sellout. Because so many extremely brutal things were going on in this movie, I was unable to make it to the end of this movie. To tell you the truth, Watching this movie can give a man bad dreams faster than any horror movie out there! Now, I know Spielberg had good intentions when making this movie, Being that he wanted to give moviegoers a vision of what black people had to put up with when this was all happening in real life, But this was too raw. I could never imagine anyone wanting to actually own this movie! How the hell would you watch something like this that's barbaric more than once? Although i am a fan of Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, And Matthew Mcconaughey, I am unable to ever attempt to watch this movie all the way through. And yes, It is true that Cinque did become a slave trader just one year after being freed. Look it up on the internet if you think i'm wrong. To me, This movie's focus shouldn've be so much on Cinque, It should've also gave a deeper insight to some of the many others that had to suffer with him on that boat. Although this isn't a bad movie, It's certainly a movie that you'll most likely never wanna see more than once. What disturbs me is that this movie is actually being used for educational purposes in schools! I know these brutal events really took place, But that doesn't mean that you have to attempt to reenact these violent events scene for scene in a movie.

The film may not be completely historically accurate, but it is an important film.

48509,4,0783227272,"Another Steven Spielberg cinematic triumph, Amistad garnered four Academy Award nominations - among them, Best Music Original Dramatic Score (John Williams) and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Anthony Hopkins). Based on the true story of the 1839 slave revolt on the slave trade ship Amistad, the film provides a dramatic visual glimpse into the horrors of 19th Century slavery. Just as Spielberg's masterpiece Schindler's List created an onscreen record to account for the Nazi atrocities of the Holocaust, Amistad stands as a testament to the evils of the Atlantic slave trade with the United States of America. Be prepared to watch a film with graphic portrayals of human bondage and mistreatment...

When Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) is lured from the safety of his African village and trapped like a wild animal, slave traders place him in bondage and board him on a large ship set to sail for the Caribbean. Chained to the floor, side-by-side inside the hull of the galleon, hundreds and hundreds of kidnapped Africans are brutally packed together like sardines. They are rarely fed (and very little when food is given), and they must use the bathroom where they lie, be sick where they lie, and some even die while chained to the others. The conditions are a literal hell on earth.

These opening scenes, just like Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, are the most vivid and powerful - creating images that will stay with you forever. Chained together, one-after-another, the slaves are punished when one of them is thrown overboard, dragging the others to the bottom of the sea.

However, one slave aboard Amistad decides to fight back. When the opportunity presents itself late one night, Cinque sparks a revolt against the slave traders. He and his fellow countrymen take the ship by force and kill their captors. Now free, the men attempt to set sail for their native land, but in the darkness of night, they end up sailing to America instead.

The grounded ship gains national political interest when the survivors of the Amistad are treated as slaves. Even President Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) takes an interest in the matter. When young and idealistic lawyer Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) and freedman Joadson (Morgan Freeman) take up the task of representing Cinque's interests in an American court, the case becomes larger than life. Cinque tells the tale of his capture, the island sorting facility for future American slaves, and the mistreatment of human beings in the pursuit of monetary profit. When the case goes before the Supreme Court, former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) enters the picture in an attempt to win a victory for freedom and individual rights...

One of the most dramatic and important films of the decade, Amistad will open your eyes to the mistakes of our past. It will make you angry at the past injustices of preceding generations. But more importantly, Amistad serves as a reminder to the current and to future generations that freedom is not to be taken for granted. It is the birthright of all men, and it is our obligation to fight for it whenever we can. This important message, and its historical lessons, make Amistad a definite must-see movie that no American can afford to miss...

48510,5,0783227272,"Let's face it. We go to movies to be entertained. And enlightened. And informed. And all of the other reasons we shell out our hard earned cash. But primarily, we go to movies to be entertained, perhaps for a couple of hours, perhaps to live in a life that is totally not like ours.

Much has been said about Amistad, and the glaring, whitewashed history it seems to offer. However, taking history, and blending into a movie is always a tricky business; much of it at the discretion of the producers and director who have one primary motivation: that is, to the story. They must tell a story, story is first. How many times have we sat through a movie with such an unbelievablly weak story, and you've found yourself checking your watch every five minutes for it to end? This doesn't happen at any time with Amistad, Steve Spielberg's retelling of a famous slave revolt on board a Spanish slave ship, and the chilling aftermath. Both brutal and richly drawn, this movie deserved much more praise and acclaim than it received.

Amistad introduces us to Cinque, a brash, intelligent man captured into slavery. Smart enough to understand the situation without having to understand English, Cinque organizes a revolt on the ship transporting him to slavery after cunningly breaking free from his chains. The captain tricks the freed slaves by taking them west instead of home to the east, and into jail. As with almost everything in America, the legal system becomes embroiled with these people and their eventual fate.

Stellar performances reign in this movie, from the always amazing Morgan Freeman, to the understated performance of Anthony Hopkins at John Q Adams, who eventually represented the Africans in the Supreme Court. However, one performance soars, literally soars over the rest, and the is newcomer Djimon Hounsou. His work is breathtaking as he literally becomes Cinque. The moment when he stands up in court and speaks English for the first time, requesting his freedom, is enough to provoke goosebumps and tears. Why Hollywood hasn't used Hounson more is beyond me.

Another unlauded part of this film is the beautifully, haunting score. It's a richly layered musical performance that illuminates the story, while incorporating elements of African music. People say that if you notice things like the music while watching a movie that you really aren't into it; but in this case, you notice the music as an integral part of the masterpiece.

When creating a historically based movie, though, you must be given some dramatic license to tell the story the best way possible. If you've ever watched a movie based on an historical event, it's always modified in some ways. Those that aren't are called documentaries. If you want to know the story of Amistad, I highly recommend a wonderful documentary called ""Voyage of La Amistad: Quest for Freedom"". There you can learn.

Amistad is not a movie that makes you feel good, or makes you feel comfortable. The stain of slavery is dyed permanently into our national fabric, and we, as a nation, need to learn how to deal with this. Amistad takes us a step forward. We must remember. We must remember. Amistad allows us to remember.",1109289600,4,3189,4.896296296296296
48511,4,0783227272,"I find it interesting to read the negative reviews offered by critics who fault the movie for distorting history.  Some of these bash the movie for giving too much credit to the Africans and African Americans (through Cinque and the fictional Joadson character) and too little to white abolitionists.  Others bash the movie for casting the Africans as too passive, as helpless victims rescued by noble and brilliant white activists.

I myself prefer historical films be as accurate as possible.  But I accept that some artistic license and fictionalization must be taken to make this a drama rather than a documentary.  As a drama, then, it seems from the divided opinions of the historically minded critics that Spielberg has struck at least a rough balance; that is, he doesn't seem to have gone to such an extreme in his personal interpretation and retelling of the events as to provoke a unanimous response from (self-proclaimed) period experts.

My own opinion is that the movie works well, as long as it is taken as a point of departure rather than a final word.  I think its value lies in raising questions, outlining issues and sparking the imagination.  Any intelligent viewer will sense and suspect that things weren't exactly as portrayed in the film (the slave ships probably did not play emotional, epic music in their cargo holds and it shouldn't be too hard to understand that the crew dancing with their female captives on deck is a PG representation of rape).  And if some viewers are spurred to look at the case more closely, so much the better.

On the other hand, the characters of the enslaved warriors doesn't receive the same level of realism, and I felt like there wasn't a bad soul among them. The few action scenes, notably an escape attempt in the opening, are handled with the usual Spielberg masterful touch. However, the bulk of the movie is talky and slow-moving, with a lot of heavy-handed moralism. It made me feel really awful about slavery, and gives you a real sense of the transition between their lives of freedom in Africa, and their captivity. In modern society, too much focus is put on American blacks after slavery; the stereotypes of the poorly educated negro are enduring, but the proud ancestry of black americans goes back further.",1104796800,,862,4.71523178807947

Their landing then ensued one of the most controversial and historically significant series of court battles in the United States history.

  Spielberg does an excellent job portraying the struggle for the Africans freedom.  With some nice shots and some good actors the movie does the struggle over the Amistad some good justice.  Speaking of actors, Djimon Hounsou does a superb job acting as the reluctant leader of the Africans.  Also, Matthew McConaughey does an equally excellent job as the first lawyer for the Africans.

Funny that Spielberg chooses to omit the African character's lucrative enterprise in the slave trade when he returns to his homeland. Maybe he should make more movies about the countless Africans who enslaved other Africans to explain how they eventually came to America: after all as Caine said, ""Am I not my brother's keeper?""

 The movie is filled with false historical characters and gives the impression that the civil rights movement well underway as early as in the 1840s: baloney! Even in the 1860s, abolitionism was nothing but propaganda to lure ignorant zealots as canon fodder to the front lines of the Civil War; the cause of the conflict being a lot more disturbing: carpetbagging industrialists looking for low paying factory slaves to the north and snug plantation dixiecrats wanting to keep their slaves south of the Mason-Dixie line. Perhaps Spielberg should make a movie explaining how the KKK was formed in Connecticut and not the South as most people think.

 The film is too revisionist and soft-hearted for my taste. If a point is to be made by such films, then it should give weight to all of the issues involved. Maybe someone will have the guts to do a movie about these truths but,until then, I'll have to continue turning my head in disgust at this Hollywood drivel.",1091491200,5,1409,4.882845188284519
48516,4,0783227272,"The word ""powerful"" has become a cliche when describing movies, which is unfortunate. However this film contains material that really moved me to strong emotion- something rare in today's bland entertainment market. Amistad does not simplify slavery as the above reviewer stated- rather it shows the audience the reality of slavery, and that we as a nation were guilty of supporting a terrible injustice. America embraced slavery for many years after most of our European friends had abolished it- a fact clearly demonstrated in this film by the presence of a british naval officer tasked with finding and destroying a carribean slave base.
This movie does revolve around the courtroom, but does so in a way that is both entertaining and educational. It shows how even the best courts can be warped or crippled by political influence and red tape. The characters are simple yet believable. In particular the roles of Cinque and John Q. Adams are played masterfully.
The speech given by Adams at the conclusion is a word-for-word transcript of his actual speech given to the Supreme Court. This speech is one of the more bold and patriotic speeches given in American history, and gives me goose bumps every time I read/see it. Amistad is an exceptional movie that forces the viewer to look back on our past with an unflinching eye and embrace both our courage and our shame as a nation.",1080604800,3,1385,4.897872340425532

Instead they are tricked into sailing north and are captured in New England. The trial that resulted began in insignificance but escalated until it drew in some of the most powerful individuals of the time, especially former President John Quincy Adams.
The fact-based thriller transcends itself in Spielberg's epic.  Yes, the story is one of heroism on the part of men trying to secure their freedom.  But the real importance of AMISTAD is its gritty, nauseating portrayal of slavery and of those who fought it and of those who espoused it.  It tells of how many of the ridiculous politicians of the time continued to bury their heads in the sand rather than take the hard steps that would require America and Americans to live up to the creeds and beliefs that had made them what they were.
Djimon Honsou (GLADIATOR) is wonderful in his portrayal of Cinque, the reluctant leader of the band of Africans. Matthew McConaughey portrays Lawyer Roger Sherman Baldwin, Morgan Freeman is Mr. Joadson and Anthony Hopkins is absolutely striking in the role of John Quincy Adams.  John Williams provides one of his most soaring and original soundtracks ever.

48518,5,0783227272,"A film by Steven Spielberg
""Amistad"" is a fact based account of a 1839 revolt by African slaves on the slaveship La Amistad, and the legal trial in the United States over what exactly should be done with them after they were rescued (and imprisoned) on American soil.  ""Amistad"" was Spielberg's first serious work since ""Schindler's List"" (not counting ""Jurassic Park 2"" which was also released in 1997), and it should be counting among the best movies of 1997.  It is a powerful film.
The central story is that of the African slaves.  The movies focuses on one particular slave, Cinque (Djimon Honsou), so that we have someone to be interested in, and so that the human story of their experiences can be told.  They were able to overthrow the slavers while on the slave ship, but their captive was able to sail them to America rather than back to Africa.  Upon arrival in America, the slaves are promptly captured by American soldiers and imprisoned until their status can be ascertained.  As the lawyer for the Africans, Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) says in the movie, ""it is a matter of property.""  Who owns the slaves?  The soldiers who captured the slaves claim ownership as salvage.  The slavers claim ownership citing a legal purchase of the slaves in Cuba.  The government of Spain claims ownership.  The Africans say they are free men.  Who owns the slaves?  Are they legal property?  This central question is what the movie revolves around and works towards answering.  We learn the answer early in the movie, but the question is what can Baldwin prove before the courts, and will the courts listen to him?
Steven Spielberg did a good job in showing that this was not just a case of the white man jumping and rescuing the black man.  That did exist here, but Spielberg showed just how central and important Cinque was, how his actions and his words were what helped the case for the Africans the most.  All the while, Baldwin and Joadson (Morgan Freeman), a freed slave, are entreating former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) to become an advocate on behalf of the Africans.
As I mentioned earlier, this is a very powerful film.  There is an extended sequence were Spielberg shows the experience of the slave ship and it is so horrible that I don't think I can put words to it.  While ""Amistad"" may not rank quite as high as ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" on the list of great movies, this is an excellent movie that deals with a subject usually ignored.  This is a slower paced film, with more time spend talking and in the courtroom, but it is a very good one, too.",1072828800,2,2604,4.668859649122807

Amistad is set in the 1830s and tells the true story of Africans shackled and taken from their homes and forced on to the Spanish slave ship Amistad.  There they are beaten, starved and some are thrown into the ocean, chained together and left to drown.  The inhumane conditions on the ship are un-imaginable to anyone viewing this film. Eventually, the Africans take over the ship by killing the crew and forcing the Captain to route them back to Africa, so they thought.  Eventually the Captain routes the ship toward America, where American coastguards board the ship and take them to America for trial for murder.  A local abolitionists, played by Morgan Freeman, teams with a real-estate attorney, played by Matthew McConaughey, to help them fight for their freedom.
Political problems are against them at every turn with President Van Buren, played by Nigel Hawthorne, campaigning for re-election by being pro-slavery and a civil war riding on the case's verdict.  The President plays his political hand and the trial looks to be doomed until the team convinces ex-President John Quincy Adams, played by Anthony Hopkins, to help them take on the Supreme Court to help win the freedom of these 50 Africans and maintain humanity among mankind.
Since it is based on a truestory, this movie is great for those who love history or those who are studying slavery, the law or civil war.",1067040000,,1771,5.196491228070175

Also, its not very historically accurate. This is not a problem dramatically (""Nixon"" for example:great drama, horrible history), but its a personal pet peeve of mine.

48522,4,0783227272,"I just recently got a chance to see this on TV, as I missed it back during it's release. As always Spielberg's methods draw you into the picture and capture you for the entire length of the movie. ""Amistad"" is a great historical Drama based on a true story about a ship load of African slaves that had mutineed against their spanish captors and landed on the shores of America, and the ensuing legal battle deciding thier fate (do they go back to the spainish government? the slave traders? or do they go free?).
With such an interesting tale to tell, and such excellent implimentation, it's hard not to like this movie. Spielberg had many obviously inspired moments in this film, showcasing the relationship of the slaves and their lawyer and the struggle to understand one another and flashbacks of the brutality the slaves had endured at the hands of their captors. The movie has many memorable moments that will stay with you and many parts that make interesting statements about human nature. One such interesting scene has the africans looking through a bible that was given to them, and they try to make sense of it, even though they know no english, by the pictures alone. One really gets the sense of what it must be like to be among and at the mercy of a strange and foreign culture.

48523,5,0783227272,"Steven Spielberg and Debbie Allen's exercise of poetic license through this docudrama frames another awesome revelation of the historic, bitter Slavery roots of noble America, a nation of immigrants. It lends a new appreciation for the term ""African American"", just as elsewhere we have come to better understand ""Native American"". It is ""a story about mankind... the very nature of man"".
The epic human struggle combined with the historic realities of effects like Jefferson-Hennings descendants and an American President's recent symbolic pilgrimage to the ""point of no return"" on Coreo Island off the coast of West Africa are instructive of the noble spirits of American liberty springing in part from the tortured roots of Slavery, and provides this old white guy with a far better insight into the imperatives for an African American (Smithsonian) Museum.
Those great cultures forcibly contributed much of the basic values of our America; and these, our roots in splendid diversity, allow a far more robust and spiritual human ecology that we know as America, compared to the centuries of virulently tribal isolationism elsewhere now so obviously center stage in world affairs.",1058659200,2,1182,5.360215053763441
48524,4,0783227272,"Have the critics of this film's historical ""accuracy"" never heard of ""dramatic license""? If they had, then they would understand that Spielberg, like most of his profession, slightly alters history to make for greater theatrical effect or even heighten the events of the story. ""Amistad"" achieves both with scenes of horror combined with those of great poignancy that make for a total movie experience.
While there are times when the film drags, the performances and the engrossing story itself make up for the few inadequacies. Though stars Morgan Freeman (especially riveting in the inspection of the Amistad scene), Anthony Hopkins, and Matthew McConaughey perform well in their respective roles, the best acting belongs to Djimon Hounsou, Razaag Adoti, and Abu Bakarr Fofanah as three of the Africans, and the underrated Pete Postlethwaite as prosecutor Holabird. Nigel Hawthorne, as the inept President Van Buren, and Peter Firth as a conscious-ridden British ship captain are also memorable.
Spielberg skillfully balances a movie that is a courtroom drama mixed with an indictment against the slave system of America's past. The scenes of the events of the cursed ""Middle Passage"" are as graphic as is possible within the confines of Hollywood filmmaking.
John Williams contributes a beautiful and understated score, just below the surface of the on-screen events, providing just enough to carry the story along.",1055203200,51,1418,5.391891891891892
48525,4,0783227272,"Amistad is a very moving and thought provoking movie.  It gives us a look at a part of our past which we should all learn more about.
The story focuses on the struggle of illegally captured Africans to re-gain their freedom and return to their native Africa.  The Africans are captured, transported to Cuba and then transferred to another ship, La Amistad, for the final leg of their journey.  However, there is a mutany and the Africans seize control of the ship.  All but two of the white crew members are killed during the mutany.  When the ship nears land, Long Island, to replenish deminished water supplies, they are captured and face trial for murder.
The drama that unfolds is fastening and disturbing.  The struggle over freedom is based in determining if the Africans are actually illegally seized Africans or if they are slaves, that is if they were born into slavery, and therefore property.
  The ensuing legal battle gives the viewer a look into the many conflicting forces that were at play in the United States during the 1830s.  It is also a sobering look at how the politically powerful tried to manipulate the legal system to get their desired ends.
Cast is very strong and gives a very moving performance.",1041465600,4,1225,4.740566037735849
48526,2,0783227272,"Call me naive but I figured Amistad was a movie that would show the horror of the transatlantic slave in much the same way Spielberg used Oscar Schindler's story to show the tragedy of the holocaust. What do we get instead? A courtroom drama. At a point I was wondering if this was a movie about the escaped Africans or the greatness of John Quincy Adams. There is a scene where Morgan Freeman vainly struggles to look noble and inspired after a summation by Adams which leaves us in no doubt of the answer to that question in Spielberg's mind.
It is really curious how the Africans seem to disappear in a movie about them. With the exception of Cinque, no black character is really fully developed. The atrocities endured by the slaves in the middle passage are shown in very brief taut scenes. Even the most shocking lacks the emotional impact of the scene where Amon Goethe decides to use a young boy for target practice because we do not have enough time to know the victims.
Perhaps it is really asking too much for any white American to make a picture about slavery on the same level as Schindler's list. There is after all a question of guilt and no one likes to feel guilty. It is the same reason you don't find German directors making movies about the holocaust. Imagine what would have happened if Spike Lee had directed this joint.
Amistad has its moments. For example a scene where Cinque and his friend try to interpret the bible is very touching. However I cannot recommend this movie. Pick up a copy of the book, ""The interesting narrative of the life of Olaudah Equiano"" instead. Olaudah was an 18th century Igbo slave from my own neck of the woods in Nigeria. His perspective will give a truer picture of the horrors of slavery.",1026172800,3,1745,4.525316455696203
48530,3,0783227272,"I sincerely believe that Spielberg had honest intentions to make statements about racism in this, but somehow, he gets just too caught up in making a spectacular movie.
There are good elements in this movie, but they unfortunately are exterior elements, details like the dress of the characters, spectacular cinematography, and some very insightful acting, especially Anthony Hopkins as President John Quincy Adams.  All this adds to the entertainment aspect of the film but not to the essence.  He doesn't really force us to look at the morals and the ethics of the situation.  Instead, there's a superficiality throughout.
I do believe that this story is worth telling, and the resulting movie is worth seeing because through the superficial entertainment the discerning viewer may be somewhat stimulated into thinking about the issues that could have been better tackled here.
As in SCHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg is looking at racism, but through different eyes.  Somehow, there is a condescending tone here, and he is not tuned in completely to the complexities of the situation portrayed.
There's no way that I can trash this film.  On the other hand, I can not hold it up as an important film that must be seen.  For entertainment and for a partial look at the subject, this is OK.  For a deeper questioning, look elsewhere.  I've just reviewed a TV adaptation of AN OUTPOST OF PROGRESS, and while that is hardly spectacular, it gives far deeper insight.",1023235200,36,1458,5.020746887966805
48531,3,0783227272,"Movies about historical subjects often fictionalize. Amistad has a strong ideological slant. The history it revises is available in the excellent book, Mutiny on the Amistad, by Howard Jones. A review essay in the February 1998 issue of Commentary Magazine describes the movie's bias and offers examples. Here are others.
 The film consistently overstates the Black and understates the White role in the effort to free the Africans:
1. The historical role of Dwight Janes (a white New London abolitionist) of alerting American abolitionists to the arrest of the Africans is transferred to Joadson, a fictitious black abolitionist, played by Morgan Freeman.
2. The historical role of Baldwin and Tappan (both white abolitionists) in requesting the help of ex-president John Quincy Adams early in the case is transferred primarily to Joadson, whose appeal is portrayed as more intellectually and morally cogent than Tappan's.
3. The historical role of Adams in helping defense counsel to improve their case by peppering them with legal questions is transferred to Cinque, the African leader.
4. The historical pressure from white public opinion in the North, widely favorable to the Africans, is omitted.
5. The film gives no sign of the impressive intellectual strength in the white abolitionist ranks, e.g., the speed and acumen with which central issues in the case were grasped. Within a few days of the Africans' arrest, Janes had outlined the argument in their defense that would be adopted by the Supreme Court. Within two weeks, Seth Staples and Theodore Sedgwick, white abolitionist lawyers, had addressed a memo to President Van Buren, reinforcing the Janes analysis and arguing powerfully against any executive move to take the case away from the courts.
 Fictions are employed to suggest that the story's blacks are sharper and wiser than the whites:
1. Joadson's opinion that the destruction of slavery is necessary to complete the American revolution, rudely put down by Adams at their first meeting, is echoed and vindicated by the close of Adams' argument before the Court. Here a person who never existed is represented as making an argument in a meeting that never took place, supporting a thesis that Adams never adopted.
2. Cinque's superb intelligence enables him to figure out what Baldwin means by drawing lines in the sand, to raise a host of possibly relevant legal points and to teach Adams the perspective that crowns his argument. The divination, the legal advice and the crowning argument were all fanciful.
 The film also misleads by anachronistically positing the danger of civil war if the Africans won in court: a fictitious warning by the Southern Senator John Calhoun that their release would be a long step toward war and a fictitious willingness by Adams to accept that result as completing the American revolution. This grossly exaggerates the portentousness of the case. People were not predicting or threatening civil war, despite events far more divisive than a Supreme Court decision based on the illegality of the transatlantic slave trade. The beauty of this case for the abolitionists was that the men who claimed to own these Africans were not Americans. Here actual slavery could be vigorously and triumphantly combatted by the substantial body of white opinion that considered slavery and the slave trade morally wrong, but did not wish to press abolition on the South.
 More important, the film creates a false impression re the kind of arguments presented to the Supreme Court in behalf of the Africans, and the basis of their victory. It suggests that the captives were freed because Adams persuaded the court to stand tall with the Declaration of Independence and the Founding Fathers. But in fact only a few seconds of Adams' eight-hour argument referred to the Declaration, and the argument that counted with the Court was made by Baldwin.
 According to the Court's opinion, the question was whether these Africans were owned by the Spanish claimants. The decision that they were not was based on a law and a fact: the Spanish law banning the Atlantic slave trade, and the fact of fraud in the ship's papers identifying the Africans as ladinos.
 The injustice of slavery is now so central to our moral code that it may be hard for people to understand how any Supreme Court decision could stop short of it, if the justices were responding to the merits. But the Court was applying the positive law of its time. It accepted the rationale argued by the abolitionists from the beginning (Janes to Baldwin, Staples and Sedgwick to Van Buren) and presented by Baldwin as his second argument. This rationale protected mutinous blacks, provided they had been illegally held as slaves.
 In his first argument, Baldwin sought a wider protection, a rule under which the status of a black fugitive would be determined not by the federal government but by the state to which he fled. By this proposal mutinous blacks fleeing places other than the American South could be declared free on their arrival in a free Northern state, regardless of their slave status elsewhere. But this argument (which the Court's opinion ignored) was as firmly confined to positive law as the argument that triumphed. In an early sentence, Baldwin invoked ""the great principles of the Revolution,"" the Declaration of Independence and ""the genius of our institutions,"" but he did not profess to derive his legal conclusions from these premises.
 Adams made JUSTICE in caps a continuing theme of his speech, but he was not thereby referring to any provision of the Declaration or any position on the morality of slavery. He was arraigning the Van Buren administration in detail and at length for favoring the Spanish claims when justice required impartiality, and for intervening in ways that justice would have barred. An ex-President exposing the machinations of the current chief executive, a former Secretary of State examining and scolding every step and misstep of the present Secretary!

Admittedly there are the usual typecast figures of evil (Spanish sailors) and good (Morgan Freeman as the appointed Chief) but this is definitely a great film.

48536,1,0783227272,"This is a film about a true life incident. Some slaves on route to Cuba mutinied and took control of their ship. They attempted to force the surviving crew to take them to Africa but instead the captain of the ship directed it north and it was captured by the Americans.
This then led to a complicated debate about what should happen. Under existing law it was clear that if the slaves were from Africa then the taking of them as slaves amounted to kidnapping. They were entitled to kill the people in the ship and to escape. If on the other hand they were slaves from Cuba their actions would amount to murder.
The various court cases were however not about these issues. What they were about was procedural matters of whether the ""slaves"" should be returned to Cuba for a trial run in a kangaroo court or whether they should not...
The critical thing of course is that the trials were not concerned about slavery at all. Slavery was a given, the question for the various courts was simply were these men slaves or were they free men wrongly reduced to servitude and further if so what court should make the decision.
Instead the film tries to make this film an epic which somehow showed that America was for slaves. Hopkins makes a number of moving speeches on this theme but the reality is that it is all nonsense. This incident had nothing at all to do with the move to abolish slavery in the United States.
The film also is obnoxious as it relegates the Africans at the centre of the action to playing the role of dumb oxes who are saved by intrepid white characters.

I  decided  that  it  was  good,  but  not  great  as  I  had  thought  the  first  time.  The  bad  pionts  are  namely:  it  is  more  about  lawmen  and  law  rather  than  the  Africans,  and  far  too  extreme  for  most  viewers,  not  including  myself.  And  the  biggest  con  for  the  terribly  anticlimatic  ending.  I  mean  I  understand  that  it  is  accurate  and  probably  what  really  happened,  BUT  COME  ON!  I  sat  through  the  whole  2  hours  and  30  minutes  just  to  get  a  letdown?  And  to  make  it  worse,  you  have  to  read  it,  why  couldn't  they  have  showed  it  out?  Like  I  said,  it  is  probably  realistic,  but  be  a  little  creative  and  give  us  a  type  of  ending  that  made  THE  SHAWSHANK  REDEMPTION  such  a  masterpiece.  Even  the  director  Steven  Spielburg  made  an  awesome  ending  in  SHINDLER'S  LIST  that  killed  this  movie.  I  am  not  talking  about  the  few  minutes  before  the  end,  those  were  cool  and  formed  some  kind  of  freedom  among  the  Africans  that  were  illegaly  traded.  I  am  talking  about  the  VERY  END  WHERE  THEY  SHOW  THE  BOAT  LEAVING  AND  MAKE  YOU  READ  THE  REST.
  Besides  all  of  that,  it  could  have  been  a  masterpiece.  There  is  a  great  cast,  great  speech  at  the  end  by  ANTHONY  HOPKINS,  awesome  music,  good  DIOLOUGE  and  DIALECT(  especially  with  the  Africans  ),  and  MORGAN  FREEMAN  always  kicks  butt  with  his  acting.

And  lastly,  Anthony  Hopkins  sould  have  won  best  actor  for  this  movie(  must  have  been  a  tough  call,  he  was  nominated  against  ROBIN  WILLIAMS  in  the  highly  overrated  GOOD  WILL  HUNTING.
  If  anyone  wants  the  PLOT,  here  it  is:  Illegaly  traded  Africans  are  boarded  on  the  boat  LA  AMISTAD.  They  revolt  against  the  crew  members  and  only  leave  two  alive  to  steer  the  ship  back  to  their  homeland  AFRICA.

There were great performances in it by Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, and the actor who portrayed Cinque. The slave ship scenes were as brutal as they were beautiful, and that leads to the first of the film's two major problems. It seems that Spielberg, master storyteller, though he be, can only tell one kind of story--the neat, uplifting one. He makes even ugly seem beautiful, and thereby palatable. I don't want to overstate my point, but here it is: I did not feel the kind of ANGER or OUTRAGE that I, as an African American, should have upon viewing such a subject. The second problem is the film's point of view. Most reviewers have written that the film is done from the Africans' point of view. I disagree. The point of view is shared--at most. Here is a neat way to do a movie like this the next time a director gets the urge to, and then you'll understand my problem with Amistad's point of view: why not have the AFRICANS speak English and have the AMERICANS speak some sort of made up gibberish language? Then the viewer will have total empathy for the slaves and begin to get some inkling of what it must have been like to be stolen from your home and brought to this strange land in chains.",998956800,,1283,4.440677966101695
48540,4,0783227272,"I applaud ""Amistad""'s decision to tell its story from the point of view of the Africans.  We see the United States, and the local politics, through their eyes -- chilly, contradictory, and often downright silly.  Not enough can be said about Djimon Hounsou's screen presence.  He dominates the film's opening and closing shots, and the overwhelming majority of the rest of the scenes.
The rest of the cast is a glorious assemblage.  Dozens of veteran character actors are almost shoehorned into the piece, tripping over each other to steal the show.  Arliss Howard, Austin Pendleton, and Harry Groener are all lurking in the background, for those who pay attention.  The big-name stars, the faces on the movie poster, are also a draw:  Anthony Hopkins, again playing a US President, is dazzling.  Pete Postlethwaite fortunately gets ample time to strut his craft as the leering District Attorney.
I'm a little puzzled by the courtroom scenes, most notably the lengthy oral argument Hopkins gives before the Supreme Court.  Granted, this film takes place in 1839, but the Court doesn't interrupt Hopkins once -- not a single question!  Retired Justice Harry Blackmun appears on the bench, although he doesn't say a word.
Matthew McConaughey plays the standard Spielbergian lawyer.  Unlike the poor fellow in ""Jurassic Park"", the attorney Baldwin is given time to grow and develop - but he's still played by Matthew McConaughey, so the character perhaps lacks some of the realism he so richly deserved.  He says less in thousands of words than Postlethwaite does with one tilt of the head.
There's a lot in ""Amistad"" to appeal to moviegoers of all stripes.  I don't think the movie was meant to be as powerful as ""Schindler"" -- the American politics are too one-dimensional, the political machinations almost done for laughs -- but for the most part it's a symphony of filmmaking and a movie to be seen more than just once.",993340800,3,1921,4.965625

Kudos to Spielberg and producer Debbie Allen for telling this story, kudos to the actors (especially Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, and Anthony Hopkins) for their representations, but most importantly kudos to the actual heroes involved. Other critics have claimed that Spielberg has made the characters too stereotypical and one-dimensional--I don't find this an accurate criticism, given that the abolitionists have an argument when one of them says that the slaves would be more beneficial to their cause as martyrs; and given that John Quincy Adams does his best to avoid any involvement in the case at all. Indeed, I thought that the story, primarily a courtroom drama colored by politics and economics, rather than a swashbuckling tale of revolt at sea, was complex, sophisticated and beautifully told. True, there were a few moments when Spielberg let Hollywood run away with him. The most notable of these occurred when the swelling chorus and the lighting drowned the genuine feeling when Djimon Hounsou declares to the courts ""Give Us Us Free!"" in sickly-sweet sentiment. But in an age when the US Supreme Court seems to have given up any pretense of non-partisanship, and when so many politicians care less about what is morally right than what is economically profitable, Amistad is a movie that ought be required viewing.
As a composer, I have one major complaint: the music (""by"" John Williams) seemed to me to be blatantly plagiarised from Aaron Copland, especially the opening of his ballet Billy the Kid.

48544,1,0783227272,"There is something cartoonish about Amistad. If social malefactors in real life had evil, cunning and opportunism so obviously stamped on their features, broad layers of the population would have no difficulty, as they do, in sorting out their friends from their enemies. Several processes seem to have been at work in producing this failed artistic result. No one has ever suggested, in the first place, that Spielberg was a profound thinker or an artist of unlimited talent. It is not the director's fault, naturally, but the phenomenal success of his films over the past two decades has undoubtedly been bound up with social and artistic processes of a rather retrograde character. As a result, almost all of Spielberg's films and the conceptions they embody are truly childish, not 'child-like'. But there is another critical element which must be added into the mix when considering the specific failings of Amistad: the truly deleterious impact of `political correctness' on artistic work. Nearly every aspect of the film reveals a desperation, a mania almost, to satisfy the strangle hold political correctness has over much of society. It is in this light that one has to view the film's extremely idealized portrayal of the Africans. The treatment of slavery itself as an historical phenomenon also suffers. Very little  matter-of-fact analysis occurs in Amistad. The director is determined to focus the spectator's attention on the horrors of the situation at every moment for fear of being accused of insensitivity to the suffering of the slaves. Under those conditions, where events and people are depicted as they ""should"" have been and not as they were, the possibility of an objective historical accounting, as well as the possibility of the artist being honest with himself goes out the window. We are left with a stilted, distorted picture, arranged so as not to offend. The fact is, nothing but intellectual harm has come from the influence of political correctness. Amistad demonstrates this.",985219200,25,2011,5.187692307692307

48547,5,0783227272,"This is an important video to see.  Based on the historical incident in 1839 of a group of 45 slaves who took over their ship, the Amistad,  and wound up in Connecticut.  This is a the story of slavery as only Steven Spielberg could tell it.  And it is also the story of the United States of America headed toward civil war, the story of petty politics, and a serious debate in front of the supreme court with Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams.
The film is full of those modern touches that make it so typical of movies of the late 1990's.  Subtitles are used as the slaves speak in their own language and the Spanish crews speak in theirs.  This adds an authenticity to the story.  In contrast, another 1990s touch that detracts from its authenticity is that the slaves all look as if their well-muscled bodies were toned in modern gyms.
The scenes of the Africans on the slave ship are the most moving that I have ever seen filmed.  The chains are heavy and real, the terror and despair excruciating, the entire ordeal brought to the screen in horrifying detail.  Contrasted to this are the Americans in Connecticut, doing their best to create this new country.  There are abolitionists spouting moral values, lawyers debating whether the Africans are slaves or free people because of details of law, and an international treaty with Spain that is rife with politics.
The video is three hours long, which could have been trimmed by at least an hour.  The speeches get a little pompous sometimes and go on much longer than they need to.  Morgan Freeman plays a role that has obviously been written in to show that there were some wealthy free blacks in that era, a role which should have been either expanded or eliminated.
Although not perfect, this video should be seen.  Sometimes it's easy to forget how young the United States actually is and how rooted in the past our politics are. Armistad certain deepens our understanding of this heritage and enlightens us about some unpleasant truths.  Truths that we, as a people, need to look at.",979516800,23,2047,4.634349030470914

48549,4,0783227272,"Amistad is an important story in American history, and the history of slavery in America. Producer Debbie Allen was the driving force behind getting Spielburg to tell this story. For those unfamiliar - and probably most are unless they have seen this movie or read reviews or seen previews of it - La Amistad was a Spanish slave ship which was used to bring Africans to Spain from Cuba. They had previously been illegally captured and shipped from Sierra Leon. Singbe Pieh (called Cinque by the Spaniards and throughout this film), broke free of his chains and freed the other slaves who then killed most of the Spanish crew and forced the two remaining to bring them back to Africa. However, things did not turn out as planned and they were captured off the coast of Road Island, and brought to New Haven, Connecticut to determine their fate. Most of the movie, thus, is about their legal fight for freedom.
Djimon Hounsou, seen most recently in a recurring role in the TV series E.R., played Cinque as his first acting role. He has great screen presence. He speaks almost no English throughout the movie, and thus draws us to pay much more attention to his facial gestures, and raw emotions, with which he rises to the challenge of convincing us of who Cinque is without even knowing what he is saying most of the time. Some of our insight, of course, is helped by flashbacks.
Anthony Hopkins is as brilliant as ever as the former-president John Quincy Adams who seems half-senile at times, while revealing at others a great intellect and awareness still churning in an old man whose day, according to many of his contemporaries, has passed.
Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman's character is not a very visible one, or memorable, anyway. He plays an ex-slave abolitionist of the day who is much more moderate than his white colleagues, who go so far as to espouse martyrdom over victory.
Matthew McConaughey plays the young, somewhat bumbling, lawyer who goes through a personal transformation - he originally sees the case as a simple property manner and solicits the case because of experience in this area. But as he becomes involved in the slaves story, he begins to view them not as property, but as people like himself. McConaughey is convincing, though not outstanding in any way.
I did have a few qualms about this movie. For one, it was a little long. Those with problems sitting still for long periods might have to watch this in a couple of sittings. It is a very interesting story, but a lot of it is in the courtroom dealing with legalisms and so forth. I think it probably could have been a little shorter without sacrificing a lot of the story. The two and a half hours could have probably been pared to two. The other problem I had with it was that it used the standard Spielburg tricks to elicit emotion - the soaring music, extreme close-ups, etc. I have a problem with this because I feel like I'm being manipulated. I wish Spielburg would have more trust in his story, actors, and audience and not feel he has to ""tell"" people when they should feel sad, happy, etc.",976752000,4,3082,4.656880733944954
48550,2,0783227272,"Superbly crafted, wonderfully acted, powerful, real, heartfelt, and impeccable. These are all adjectives that correctly describe this film. Here's a movie that had so much going for it. I really wanted to like this film. I sat down and was amazed with pleasure by some scenes and with other scenes sat in disgust and boredom. ""Amistad"" starts out with a battle scene that reminds me of another Spielberg movie, ""Saving Private Ryan"". The opening scene is done in a way that carries all the intensity that could make it seem real. The camera sways back and forth, in a way fighthing to get the actor in frame. It's as if the camera is an extra actor in the movie. It's scenes like this, that make me have some aprreciation for this film. The screenplay by David Franzoni is done with a lot of care and does try to offer a accurate description, but it remains uneven. Some scenes aren't as well polished as other scenes. This is all due to the directing by Steven Spielberg. On the surface he may seem to be the right man for this film, after making ""Schindler's List"", which this movie may remind some of, in it's style rather than content. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Housou, Nigel Hawthorne, and Anna Paquin are wonderful to watch. But that's not the problem with this movie. The problem lies in the screenplay. The viewer switches their moods toward the film too often. One moment a scene grabs all your attention and the next one leaves you asking for more. You actually get bored with the movie. And then a great scene will appear now and then again. But after a while, you just can't take it anymore. And your left to say that you don't enjoy this movie.

One of the best stroy tellers, Spielberg tells yet another story of freedom after exploring the topic in Shindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.  This time he explore freedom in the pre-civil war period. I noticed that several reviewers felt he over simplified slavery and this portion of history.  If anything, all this did was help focus attention on freedom and the plight of the slaves featured in the movie.  Spielberg forgoes a lot of the special effects (ie: Saving Private Ryan) and instead focuses on a tight script that is delivered superbly by the actors.  Djimon Hounsou  delivers an incredibly emotional performance with stunning close ups of his face that convey emoition without saying a word.  Anythony Hopkin's portrays a very deep, reflective, complex character of John Qunicy Adams.  He delivers phenomenal speeches including lines such as, ""If a civil war is to come, then let it come.  And may it be the last battle of the American Revolution.""  That battle continues today, but the movie tells the story of how freedom can be won and that freedom is what America is all about.  The question is, how does the story end because the story of freedom and the fight against slavery continues even today.

I did not have a clear concept of what was the  African cognitive/riligious/metaphysical concept of the tragedy of slavery.  They are defined mostly in an American Christian perspective. In one view  on La Amistad, you can barely distinguish the Africans performing Islamic  prayers in the background. None of the characters evoke any Islamic  statements of faith throughout the tragedy of enslavement and loss in the  sea. In another scene, the imprisoned Africans are dancing ""noble  savage"" style around a bonefire INSIDE the prison. How could that be  possible is beyond my imagination! The director is trying to fall back on  the old western movie depictions of the native indians running around the  camp fire performing the battle dance. The real theme of the story is not  the suffering of the Aficans enslaved and inside filthy ships in the  Atlantic; it is about the American society's treatment of the issue of  slavery and the true nature of the American system of government. Needless  to say that the director wants to tell the audience a political message:  that the core of the American political system is ethical and  ""GOOD"" hearted. The only characters shown in the movie to  actually benfit financially from the slave trade were the Spanish, the  Africans who cought Cinque,and the Cubans. Not a single scene brings to the  viewer's attention images of the suffering of the slaves in an American  plantation.

48557,4,0783227272,"Whatever case can be made for Spielberg's oversimplificiationof the actual events, _Amistad_ champions a largely unexploredcountry: pre-Civil War America.  We tend to look all too often at either the American Revolution or the Civil War, but never in between. It is as if those years leading up to the Civil War didn't happen or didn't matter.  In addition to bringing us the first serious examination of the horrors of slavery conditions since _Roots_--and maybe the only lengthy filmic examination of the slave trade itself--this film looks at the state of American society in the interwar period and shows us that, yes, indeed, it was possible to stand against slavery before the Civil War made abolitionism fashionable.
I'm willing to bet, too, that these are the only screen portrayals of John Quincy Adams and Martin Van Buren available on film.  For that curiosity alone the film's worth adding to your historical fiction collection.  While I think Van Buren, like all the do-nothing or pro-slavery elements in the film are insufficiently characterized (we know nothing about them except that they are obviously bad), Anthony Hopkin's Adams is wonderfully more complex--despite the fact that the script has him principally making speeches.  There is something entirely mezmerizing about watching a man whom one feels has been largely defeated by life suddenly rise to prominence at the end of his life to say what was on his mind all those times he bit his tongue.  Though some may feel the final speech was ""grandstanding"", I was deeply moved by it.  Not only is Hopkin's performance of that final speech deeply emotional--especially when he catches a glimpse of his father's bust--there is something deeply heartening in discovering that people of influence, even in that obscure part of American history we rarely discuss, did find the courage to speak against it.
To be sure, there are flaws in the joint vision of Steven Spielberg and Debbie Allen.  The ultimately redemptive message of the movie would not have been sullied by rounding out the pro-slavery elements in the society of the time. Indeed, this would've more accurately shown why this institution we find so peculiar today had such a lock on the country back then.  From a dramatic standpoint, too, fleshing out Van Buren and the forces arrayed against Adams would've made the film entirely more tense and heightened the impact of that final speech.
But in the end what matters is that this important story got told.  And though there might have been better ways to have told the story, this certainly wasn't a bad one.
(It's worth mentioning as an aside that this DVD version has an especially intriguing making-of vignette, and that there's another version which doesn't.

Personally, I feel the movie would have been vastly superior if it had  focused more on the non-white characters. Morgan Freeman's character and  his feelings regaurding the whole affair are elements that I feel would  have made for interesting hisorical fiction. In addition, the life of the  Menday (I am not sure on the spelling) after they returned to their  homeland to find their tribe torn apart is something that would have made  for a more thorough and more tragic conclusion to a seemingly upbeat story.

The fact that this case really happened, and that it generated such disturbing political issues, mark it as an important story in U.S. history. And because the plot was based on a story which did happen, I cannot agree with the criticisms of those who faulted the movie because it portrayed whites saving blacks. I cannot see how to make the story otherwise and remain true to the original case.

 On the other hand, the scenes where the whites triumphed on behalf of the blacks were indeed maudlin and sentimental in presentation, and did seem to send a message of ""See? Not all white people are so bad."" Nonetheless, the portrait of Van Buren and the political scene of the time were strong reminders that there were plenty of whites at fault..........As for the criticisms by Hispanics that the movie portrays Spanish/Cuban people as villains, I do not see that.....As a person with Cuban ancestry, I think the movie portrayed pretty much what happened.....should Spielberg have tried to make the 2 Cuban slavers look sympathetic so as not to hurt Hispanic peoples' feelings? How should he have portrayed the queen of Spain? The Spanish royal family has always been subject to criticism, much of it from within Spain: look at the portraits painted by Goya of the Spanish court. The corruption of that institution could fill volumes.....

 In viewing this film and then reading the reviews, one thing has become very clear to me: that both whites and minorities in this country still view history through their own special racial/ethnic lenses, and with a great deal of defensiveness....to move toward the values which Spielberg tried to put forth in Amistad, we must all strive for a little more objectivity.....",950572800,29,1834,4.868589743589744

Perhaps a real story, on a more intimate scale, with real human beings not  ""symbolic figures"" would have been far more engrossing. Alas,  Spielberg is way to important for that now, he has to ""BIG"" films  dealing with ""BIG"" issues and in the process he misses the mark  completely, becuase we are watching a lavishly produced, beautifully shot  2nd grade history lesson. Like the slightly better Saving Private Ryan,  Spielberg is to busy making grandiose statements to care about real  characters. Again John Williams cheesy(for a lack of a more accurate word)  is intrusive and full of self importance. I am really glad Mr. Spielberg is  going to do a Sci-Fi film next where he'll get to do some real film-making  and not hide behind big issues.

This is not a feel good movie, nor does it make you feel like  you want to go out there and change the world; what it does do, is make you  sit back and reflect upon an incident in our nation's history that will  disappoint you. The story line centers around the capture, detainment,  transportation and murder of men, women and children who are being brought  to the United States to be slaves in 1839. The Africans on the ship  ""Amistad"" rebel, take control of the ship, and attempt to go back  to Africa to be free.

The Africans win the first few rounds only  to have their freedom appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where former  President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) is recruited to defend them.  I was saddened by the role that politics played in this freedom fight and  how President Martin Van Buren fought not to do what was right, but fought  instead to save his re-election. Earlier I said this film won't make you  want to go out and change the world...I think it's because after seeing  this film you realize that these political games have been played for the  past 160 years by Presidents and you are just fed up.

By the way, isn't it actually against the law in Canada not to include the  French?  Shouldn't Region 1- (US and Canada only) encoding  ALWAYS include  French sound and French closed captions- not only as a courtesy and an  added value, easy to include-but to comply with Canadian law?  Otherwise, a  truly great film in a wonderful format!",947116800,,985,4.727810650887574

48576,2,0783227272,"This isn't a good movie. As Spanish I  don't complaint of the cruelty of other Spanish of past centuries. No doubt they were as bad as the movie  presents and much more, but also they were usually much better sailors and  fighters than currently is show, and masters to mock hypocrital British  blockade. For the really interested I strongly recommend two master  adventure novels by Pio Baroja a superb author well liked by Hemingway that  almost won the Nobel prize. These are titled ""Adventures of Captain  Chimista"" and ""Pilots of high Seas"" both written about 1900,  and you really will know that truly Spanish fearless trafficant of slaves -  between other many  illegal and inmoral bussines- used to do withouth  censorship. Of course as all other colonial countries. Read these and  forgot this sugared comedy.",941328000,4,818,4.977777777777778
48577,1,0783227272,"This movie would have succeeded if it had starred Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Leslie Nielson and Dan Ackroyd. It's so appallingly acted, scripted and directed that it amounts to a laughable parody of a  'serious' subject matter. An exercise in sickly false sentiment with the  requisite maudlin musical score that has become Spielberg's unmistakable  trademark.

It is really nothing more than a boring - and equally badly  made - derivative of the TV  mini-series 'Roots' that was inflicted on us some 20 years ago. A cynical and inevitably failed attempt by Spielberg to gain recognition, legitimacy, and status as an auteur filmmaker. He  should stick to what he does best: catering to his uncritical and adoring  fans.",934675200,9,737,5.1344537815126055

7790171,3,0783227272,"No. 51 in the UK Warners 'Premium Collection' for BLU RAYS is Steven Spielberg's 1997 epic ""Amistad""  released 15 January 2018 in Blighty alongside his 2006 film ""Munich"" which is title No. 52.

In April 2018  this UK series for Warner Brothers (in conjunction with HMV UK) will reach title No. 62 (I've compiled the full list below with Barcodes so you can locate the right issue). Please note  there is also a Warners 'Premium Collection' out of Europe (Germany I think) where titles come in 'Digibook' form. Most releases in that film series are different to their UK counterparts (""Excalibur"" appears to be the only duplicate). Examples of European 'Premium Collection' releases include Troy, A.I., The Matrix, The Butterfly Effect, 10,000 BC, The Golden Compass, John Rambo, The Hurt Locker, Body Of Lies, Shoot 'Em Up and many more. Back to this latest 'UK' reissue...

First up this new print for ""Amistad"" is beautiful in almost all places right from the opening sequence of Djimon Hounsou's wild eyes as he claws a nail out of wood aboard the 1839 Spanish slave ship ""La Amistad"". And it continues like that for most parts right to the end (when you see the Making Of  you will immediately notice the upgrade in image quality). The glossy card slipcase once again lends this 2-disc release a very classy feel and the banded four artcards clipped inside are a very nice touch indeed (principal actors in the movie). Its a 2-Disc Set (BLU RAY and DVD) and is listed as Region ABC  All regions or Region Free  so no issues with playback anywhere. There is no booklet (mores the pity  only a few titles in this series have one) - but there is a digital download code sheet to watch the movie on the go. But for me that's where the good news ends...

Despite the amazing names in the cast (Nigel Hawthorne, Pete Postlethwaite, David Paymer, Stellan Skarsgard and Morgan Freeman) - re-watching ""Amistad"" is not a great experience. It's laden with lumpy unbelievable characters - ludicrously over the top acting (McConaughey's happy-wappy lawyer is grating instead of endearing) - and bumbling fun mixed with random horror. It all feels so dreadfully forced and clichd and weighed down with its own importance unlike the far better ""Lincoln"" that touches on the same subject of abolishing slavery and uses courtrooms as a drama setting.

Hell even the Menu has music that feels like its some triumphalist Disney cartoon and when Hopkins appears in his bumbling rendition of an ageing President John Quincy Adams - we get the good-guy melodies just so we know we're in the presence of the benevolent white man. The Extras consist of a short ""Making Of"" and a Trailer (came with the DVD) and once again there's no Spielberg commentary - so in fact there's nothing new other than an upgraded image. Audio is English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround (French, Portuguese and Spanish) with Subtitles in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

If you're a fan - then the purchase is a worthy one - the best presentation of the movie so far. But if not - I'd advise a watch first before purchasing...

This film shows the beauty of the human spirit and how it can and will win over evil even under the worst of circumstances.  Slavery was and is a desperate and ugly business in the world- but it need not crush those who are shackled.  This story is about a group of slaves who were illegally captured and sold and brought to the USA.  A young American lawyer gets involved to free them and attempts to work with one slave who assumes the role of leader.  Eventually, ex president Adams even gets involved.  This is loosely based on a true story about a slave ship called the Amistad.  You will triumph and cry.  It's wonderful!",1521504000,,747,4.522388059701493
