8110129,5,B000EHS6GE,"Even tho this is a video, it delivers what it advertised.  The Manson portion isn't long but it is graphic.  Seller is great, too.
Not for the squeamish, but I recommend it.",1376611200,,173,4.375
8110130,4,B000EHS6GE,I recommend this DVD though it is not for the faint hearted. This film follows scenes of death that include the 2nd world war and the car accidents of the fifties and also celebrity murders and deaths in the 60's.  The DVD spends some time on the Manson murders and also on Marilyn Monroe. As a crime buff I found some of the information included in this film very interesting.  This DVD includes insights found nowhere else.,1217894400,22,425,4.5064935064935066
