4602144,5,B0058YPJOU,"""The Mentalist"" returns for a fourth season on CBS, starring Simon Baker as Patrick Jane, a former psychic medium and con man, now working as a consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) with a team led by Senior Special Agent Theresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney) that includes Special Agents Kimball Cho (Tim Kang), Wayne Rigsby (Owain Yeoman), and Grace Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti).  ""The Mentalist"" has thrived for three seasons as a clever police procedural built around Jane's uncanny ability to read and manipulate people (including, sometimes, his own teammates).

As the fourth season opens, the team is in deep trouble.  Patrick Jane is on trial for murder, for having shot a man he believed to be the infamous serial killer Red John, murderer of Jane's own wife and child.  Lisbon is on suspension for failing to manage Jane, while her team has been scattered.  Patrick Jane has a lot of work to do.  He needs to somehow survive a trial, then regain the trust of a new CBI boss and resurrect his old team.

The interpersonal dynamics of the team continue to be interesting and entertaining, and will be affected by Lisbon's new supervisor, a man with an agenda.  Under duress, Lisbon and Jane will become much more frank with each other about a great many things.  Lisbon and the team will have to deal with an angry and edgy Van Pelt, traumatized by the betrayal and death of her fiancee last season.  Cho and Rigsby will have the unique experience of watching Jane manipulate someone else's team and team leader, for a change, while dealing with their own entangling personal relationships outside the team.  And is it possible that Red John is still out there, still haunting Patrick Jane? And if he is, will there be another confrontation?

""The Mentalist: The Complete Fourth Season"" is very highly recommended to its fans.",1319673600,97,1847,4.8471337579617835
4602145,5,B0058YPJOU,"Difficult to believe but that cerebral, fascinating series THE MENTALIST is already in its fourth season.  Some of the subplots left as cliff hangers in season three have been settled and the series continues to make use of Simon Baker's terrific screen presence as Patrick Jane who is able to touch the untouchable aspects of people's minds in solving some very clever crimes.  Baker's ability to carry off this enigmatic role is what makes the show tick, but it is his faithful crew of detecting minds that make the series always watchable and enjoyable - Robin Tunney as Lisbon the boss, and her associates Tim Kang, Owain Yeoman, and Amanda Rigetti.  Some of the irony of Jane's abilities are growing a bit thin, but the scripts snap and the camaraderie that emanates from this group of detectives remains magical.  So far, no disappointments. But the season just started so we have to wait and see how the entire season develops. Grady Harp, October 11",1318550400,26,957,4.817073170731708

4602699,5,B0058YPJOU,my wife and love this show. Simon Baker (main character) is outstanding in this role. Very easy to watch episodes over and over again.,1474243200,,134,4.625
4602700,3,B0058YPJOU,"Echoing other reviewers, this series is engaging, entertaining, well-paced (generally), sometimes whimsical and rarely overly serious  in many ways a throwback to shows from the 1960-70s.  The basic premise: Simon Baker portrays Patrick Jane; a mentalist, con man and faux-psychic whose wife and daughter were murdered by a serial killer in retaliation for a perceived slight. To pursue the killer and exact revenge, Jane works as a consultant to the fictional California Bureau of Investigation, using his powers of observation, analysis and psychological manipulation to solve homicides.  The CBI homicide team is comprised of a solid ensemble cast, led by Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney), who has the thankless  and generally impossible - task of keeping Janes scams and ploys barely within the limits of the law.

Ive watched portions of The Mentalist on network television and Im finally working through the entire series - in order - while indoor cycling.  Season 4 focuses more on the personal side of the CBI homicide team: Grace Van Pelt coming to terms with a recent loss, Wayne Rigsby dealing with impending fatherhood, Kimball Cho involved in a bittersweet relationship and insight into Teresa Lisbons family and past.  The police procedural storylines are a bit more mundane than in previous seasons, although there are a couple of endings that caught me by surprise.  Morena Baccarin makes a great return as Erica Flynn and Malcolm McDowell brilliantly reprises his role of cult-leader Bret Stiles.  Except for the season finale, the serial killer Red John is only marginally involved in 2-3 episodes in Season 4  unlike some negative reviewers, the Red John storylines have not worn thin for me.  A different pace and tone from the first three seasons, but still an entertaining program and worth the price of admission.

While I really like this series, my 2-star deduction is intended to draw attention to the DVD.  My DVD arrived with a knife cut through the UPC code on the outer sleeve and through the DVD case (see the attached image).  The cut did not damage any of the discs, which all worked just fine.  I was informed that certain distributors deface the UPC code so the DVD cannot be returned to a brick-and-mortar outlet.  While this may not be the sellers fault, was it really necessary to cut so deeply and essentially deface the case itself?",1474156800,2,2381,5.020356234096692

The mentalist has great casting - both regular and guest stars.  The writers did a great job.  I love the gist of this story being based on the theme of free flow - going with the spirit rather than following rigid structure.  There is good drama and humor also.

4603041,5,B0058YPJOU,"I've been watching TV since it was invented and there has been no better TV series - or even a one-off film - than The Mentalist. I have the entire DVD set but ordered one digital episode (Blinking Red Light) because the disk is damaged. I may back up all my DVDs with digital. It's hard to say in a few words all the ways TM is so worth watching repeatedly. There is immense depth of character whose nuances continue to show up with every rerun. The acting by Simon Baker, Robin Tunney and Tim Kang is spot-on perfect and not a stereotype in sight. The ethical values that shine through are admirable, the diversity in casting appears naturally appropriate for the story, as is the diversity of worldviews. The stories are clever, funny, sad, tragic, inspiring, and always creative. Even the staging: Look at Patrick Jane's hideaway in the CBI attic. Astonishingly clever! And the sex and violence are always within reason for the story, never overdone. Almost no skin. Robin's underwear is utilitarian; Simon wears pajamas to bed. What kissing occurs is restrained. It's gentle and lovely, supported by background music that is the same. As for the sex scenes, there are very few but the way Simon Baker handles them makes them a work of art. Just watch his relationship with women, the haunting loneliness he cannot express, the subdued lust in the Erica Flynn episodes so tightly controlled you hardly notice. The one brief moment it surfaced has to be the most sensuous scene ever done, with almost no physical contact. The staging, directing, acting, lighting, dialog all worked together to create a theatrical masterpiece. And above all is the character of Patrick Jane that Baker created. Totally 3 dimensional. It unfolds gradually, revealing a complex childlike character, heartbreakingly lovable, compassionate and nonjudgmental, yet so driven by a need to avenge the murder of his wife and daughter that he never hesitates to commit cold blooded murder. (Watch ""Blinking Red Light"" where Jane struggles with his conscious and then sets up a killer to sign his own death warrant.) And none of this is the least bit melodramatic.",1453248000,3,2139,4.911602209944752

4603111,4,B0058YPJOU,"Mentalist - Season Four [0638 - 09-15-2015 - DVD]
Summary:
  This is a police procedural show featuring murder investigations. As such we are introduced to the murdered individual at the start of each episode.

  A unique and very intriguing aspect of this show - that accounts for its popularity and incidentally it's long network run of 7 seasons - is the character of the mentalist Patrick Jane as played by Simon Baker. Mr. Jane in a prior life was a fraudulent spiritualist whose wife and child were brutally murdered by a sick serial killer ""Red John"". This creepy weirdo has a bizarre calling card: a large happy face painted on a wall with the victim's blood. Jane renounces his bogus avocation - mind reading and messages from the dead - and is employed as a consultant with the CBI - California Bureau of Investigation. The CBI are a squad of 4 cracker jack detectives that play extremely well off of Jane's smarty personality. Jane has an acknowledged agenda - he want to avenge the killer of his family - ""Red John"".
.

Content & Packaging:
6 disks - 24 episodes - first broadcast on CBS 9-22-2011 thru 5-17-2012. The season 4 set comes in a solid, standard, snap case - a handy booklet with cast photos and episode summaries included - a cardboard box with artwork. -  one interesting feature about the show is included on disk 6.

Positive Comments:
 One can only marvel at the witty and insightful encounters and dialog with Jane and the CBI crew. Accolades to the writes of this show.
 Simon Baker as Patrick Jane is a reason to watch this show. His laid back informality and unorthodox procedures when solving the weekly murders are arresting.
 The back-story and interactions of the 4 CBI investigators add rather than detract to the shows appeal.
 The show walks a fine line between humor and pathos and successfully pulls it off without being cute.
 In several episodes Jane show a deep and heart felt compassion for children in stressful situations. I found this very appealing and realistic.
 The cat and mouse game Patrick Jane plays with Red John and his minions is compelling television viewing.

The Cast:
 As the season progressed I noticed that the strengths and weaknesses of each CBI member was drawn out by gestures, casual remarks and actions under stress. A very talents group of actors indeed.

Negative Comments:
 After watching all seasons 1 to 4 episodes I am becoming somewhat annoyed with Patrick Jane. He is always right and in many instances behaves like a smarty-pants.
 A very few episodes had one deleted scene. I enjoy watching deleted scenes and have usually found them to be interesting and informative. I don't understand why there weren't more of them.
 Although Patrick Jane admits he was a fraud and that the whole concept is bogus when he encounters an individuals who claim ""mystical powers"" he give them the benefit of the doubt - this does not ring true to this viewer.
 My negative comments are picky and do not detract from the quality of the show.

Recommendations:
This is a well-crafted and thoughtful show and overall if the material interests you I recommend it.",1442275200,,3124,4.767657992565056

4603184,5,B0058YPJOU,A great story line with a great cast.  The twists and turns are fun to follow and they make it look like anybody could easily learn how to do detective work.  A memory palace is a wonderful idea and can be easily learned and is especially helpful for when you start getting older.  I am now 70 and need all the help I can get so the show is educational as well.,1434844800,,361,3.986111111111111

4603615,5,B0058YPJOU,"I'm in the process of re-watching (or watching, as I come across a few episodes I haven't seen) the entire series. It is fun; even as the show develops it retains a basic consistency: with a few exceptions, it is not too bloody; the regular characters are consistent in personality and some are sufficiently intriguing; the scripts tend to be good; weak scenes are sparse, bad episodes even sparser; some recurring guests (Malcolm McDowell in particular) add spice to the show; some episodes are fun. Quite nicely, the creators even manage to weave a 'happy ending' or two into a generally serious murder mystery series -- without ruining the tone.
The producers have managed to create a perfectly outrageous character in Patrick Jane and, thanks to some good acting, make him believable.",1400716800,,788,4.9772727272727275
4603616,5,B0058YPJOU,Great show. I have enjoyed the mentalist series. I would recommend this show to anyone. It does not make you think to hard and it is fun.,1400112000,,137,4.111111111111111
4603617,5,B0058YPJOU,"I am totally partial to this character and series, so I gave it top rating.  I gave the season to a friend and if I 'spoil' it for her, I am dead meat on a hook.  Jane becomes more fallible, as a new trend in this season, and that is a good thing.  Very few superheroes are mortal, Spiderman is one,  and Jane is a mortal close on being a superhero.  His fight continues against that which most law enforcement has dropped, a serial killer with a very personal involvement with the survivors around his murder victims. I finally figured out why Red John's signature smiley face bothers me so much, it is one way Charles Schultz used to draw Snoopy's face.

There is more character development of the team members, more clues, all chopped up and re-spliced so that while you are getting into a new episode, the old thread is still on your mind.  And not to be disappointed -- the old thread picks up again.  This is binge viewing material.",1396656000,,938,4.381502890173411
4603618,5,B0058YPJOU,I have been hooked on the series since season 1.  Lots of suspense and it makes you think.  Cant wait to order the next season.,1396396800,,127,4.04

4603657,5,B0058YPJOU,"Most television sitcoms today are an insult to any intelligent person.  The Mentalist is intelligent entertainment.  The characters mesh very well while playing their composite characters.  No scene-hogging horribly graphic shots of blood and guts splattered everywhere, or skeletal remains discovered and plastered in up-close shots for holding an audience because the script or the acting is so vacant.  This is serious drama, well mixed with humor. I highly recommend this series.",1390348800,,483,5.666666666666667

4603783,5,B0058YPJOU,"I love The Mentalist, and especially those show that might give a clue as to who Red John is.  This show was the first that one of the Red John suspects appeared in, and I was looking for clues that might lead to him being RJ.  I'm still not sure, but there were a few words of dialogue that put this guy in the mix.",1382659200,,316,3.8461538461538463
4603784,4,B0058YPJOU,"I love this show...  its just getting pretty predictable the more seasons they have.  Only Jane can solve the murders, always with some sort of random detail no one else would notice.  And Red John always gets away.  Still very entertaining, but too predictable.",1382659200,,262,4.886363636363637
4603785,5,B0058YPJOU,"I somehow started watching the mentalist series late in the game and became addicted.  The stories are rather simple, but Simon Baker's character is fascinating, and his back story, as well as those of the other characters, if not riveting, is at least entertaining and endearing.  I was hoping to catch up so I could start DVRing the current shows - but appears that's not going to happen.  So eventually I will need to order the following seasons.",1382572800,,449,4.730769230769231

The story lines are also gripping and well thought out. And, of course, who isn't fascinated by a super villain like Red John? It all makes for a very entertaining hour where you can completely forget any life troubles and just get lost in the action.",1381795200,,416,4.635135135135135

4604031,5,B0058YPJOU,"I loved how the producers dealt with the end of season three and maintained the emotional fallout of that pivotal moment.  They up the stakes and bring us closer to the edge in what is a well-written and thought provoking show.  Plus, it doesn't hurt how good looking Simon Baker is.",1371945600,,283,4.529411764705882

4604033,5,B0058YPJOU,All the characters in the tv series blend well together. They make this tv show a very enjoyable watching experience,1371772800,,116,4.85
4604034,5,B0058YPJOU,"Season four picks up where the Strawberries & Cream (the final episode of S3) left off. Jane is under arrest for killing the man he believed to be RJ.

We aren't told early on in the season whether this man was the real RJ or not, but the man he killed certainly has dark secrets, which are unveiled early in this fourth season. While Jane is on trial for his life, Lisbon and her team are suspended for their role in implicating the director of CBI as the RJ ""mole"" inside the CBI at the end of S3. After being released from prison (I won't say how that plays out), Jane is assigned a new team, headed by Agent Ray Haffner, an increasingly mysterious character from this point in S4, through the most recent fifth season of the Mentalist.

Also, we are introduced to the new boss, Luther Wainwright. He's young and well educated, but his academic approaches naturally clash with Jane's unconventional, yet often effective, approach to solving CBI cases.

We are also introduced to Susan Darcy, an FBI agent who takes over the case of the San Joaquin killer (4x07), quickly becomes involved in learning whether or not Jane actually killed RJ. By 4x11, this seems more and more unlikely. The writers also reintroduce Rosalind Harker (from season 1) in two episodes. She plays a key role in clarifying whether or not the man Jane killed was RJ, or whether RJ is still alive (Teaser).

Van Pelt goes through a period of recovery after shooting O'Laughlin. Rigsby finds true love with a member of the DA office, and their relationship goes a few steps beyond just dating in season 4. Cho becomes romantically interested in one of the CBI's central informants during the middle of the season. It was good to see his character expanded in this way, without betraying the core of who Cho is on the show. We also meet Tommy Lisbon, Teresa Lisbon's younger brother in one episode, as well as one of her old flames in one of the final episodes in the show.

During the two-part finale, Jane is *not* with the CBI, comes into close contact with one of RJ's mistresses, and in the final ten minutes of Season 4, Jane is in RJ's limo. One scene I think the fans really liked was seeing Jane and Lisbon finally hold hands after an intense chase of the limo. I won't disclose anymore!

In all, this season does a good job at keeping the RJ arch very much central to the show, while letting it continue to be a crime drama at the same time. I'd recommend this purchase!",1371600000,,2453,4.488789237668161
4604035,5,B0058YPJOU,"If you are a Simon Baker fan, you can't help but love this series.  If you really did not know who he was before The Mentalist, you will be searching for any and all films he has done, interviews, pictures etc. Patrick Jane is a thoroughly captivating character.  I thought Baker's previous series, The Guardian, was great; it is, but this series is meatier, more developed.  Simon Baker IS The Mentalist.  I rate it A Plus!!!",1371600000,,426,4.565789473684211

4604037,5,B0058YPJOU,"It is one of my favorite TV shows.  I prefer to watch TV shows now more than movies, because they don't take as long.  The writers are witty, original, and do it with a sense of humor.  The show could be a lot more gory, but it isn't.  I am thankful for that.  I don't need blood and gore to like something.  No downside!",1370995200,,321,3.9375

4604086,2,B0058YPJOU,"I jave finished season 4 and have now resolved to dispense with this series entirely. I like the characters, and they are well-directed. The concept of a highly intuitive consultant to the 'California Bureau of Investigation' is interesting. But I hate the plots. They have gotten tired. The idea of trying to catch 'Red John', the cold serial killer
who killed 'Jane's' (why does he have a girl's name? No one ever comments on it) wife and daughter is making me tired. -- Particularly the last few episodes which were just so sordid and horrific in content the horror belied the usual tenor of the show and weighed it down so much it was only depressing. The stories don't move and grow. They each stand alone, and the nevercatchingRedJohn has worn too thin.",1370044800,,759,4.714285714285714

We are given more information about their inner world and their own personal conflicts ( the women love this!).  In addition, I think perhaps the producers came up with a bigger budget.  Theres more action, cars blown up and other livelier, entertaining action (cool stuff for the guys).

I watched a few episodes of the Guardian and did not like the soap opera feel of the series.  The Mentalist has a recurring theme, however, each episode is usually stands alone,  I own four seasons and eagerly await the next season.  I love watching this and similar series (Burn Notice and others) on DVD because I hate the amount of time used for commercials,  Simon Baker's character is intelligent, self-assured, is not intimidated by anyone and has found out what is really important ln life.

4604358,5,B0058YPJOU,"I bought this season here because it was cheaper than retail (Shocking huh?)
Its the same quality, same product and can watch it when and where you like, unlike Digital copies in a non wifi world.  I have this same debate with everyone, to digi or not.
Digital copies are great if your a metropolis dweller who doesn't stray from your local work to starbucks to home to starbucks habit.  For those of you who actually leave WiFi coverage and see the real world I reccomend getting the DVD or if so inclined, the bluray.  The ironic thing is that the movie industry and music industry for that matter, spend millions on anti-piracy and lobbying for government restrictions on DRM (Digital Rights Management) because it drains money from their pockets, causes job loss and ""Promotes Terrorism""  The funny thing is, they are selling direct to consumers now (Digital Media) and cutting out wholesalers, retailers and in fact doing exactly what they are saying that they oppose.  Seen many record or music shops around that are not owned by billion dollar corporations? enough of that, on to the newsworthy review.

If you are looking for a truely portable means in which to be entertained, purchase the DVD.  Especially this DVD series, the plot is easy to follow, but not predictable mainly in part to very skillful editing and direction.  I have never been a huge fan of Simon Baker until this series, I really don't see any other actor that could pull it off.
The odd thing I noticed is that he looks exactly like the Red John drawing at each crime scene, its almost like he's being taunted with a caricture of him. Its not really gory like CSI, Criminal Minds or too goofy like Psych, its just right.",1361232000,,1700,4.662207357859532

4604401,5,B0058YPJOU,"I can't tell you how much I absolutely enjoy watching this show. I've only read reviews and watch a couple of scenes, but what brought my attention to this show is another TV series that randomly mentions The Mentalist and Simon Baker (great actor by the way). That TV series is Psych. Though they do seem quite familiar, both play a difference in theme and certain fashion in terms of catching a criminal. I would love to see both have a crossover story arc where Red John is connected to Psych's Mr. Yin. Since both antagonists use forms of psychological mind games, I don't see how this isn't possible.",1360886400,,605,4.559633027522936
4604402,5,B0058YPJOU,"Seasons I - IV should come complete with a notice from the Surgeon General's Office: ""Warning. THE MENTALIST may be addictive to anyone unfamiliar with great television.""

  ""Well"" (I hear you thinking), ""maybe just ONE season."" Fool not yourself, Gentle Viewer. Simply bite the bullet and buy all four. Today. Right now. For one thing, they are a joy to watch sans commercials.

  I'm sure those who've managed to find their way here unaided know enough about the cast and particulars to go on with, and they have probably already figured out that the show is stunningly brilliant. Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes in modern garb with a twist, but it is so much more.

 THE MENTALIST, in fact, lays almost every icon and clich of the whole mystery/crime genre on its ear, and, in some cases, goes them one better. Just one ""for instance"" will suffice (half the fun is searching out the others): there are two variations (so far) on MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. In addition, there are elements from many and diverse television dramas of the past, from THE FUGITIVE and PERRY MASON to STAR TREK. Yes, STAR TREK (Kimball Cho as Spock?).  Bruno Heller knows - as did Gene Roddenberry - that an audience needs a cast they can care about, which means a group of well developed characters who care about each other.

 I'm not sure Mr. Heller did all this on purpose, mind you, but the fact is that some of THE MENTALIST episodes - to say nothing of the seasons themselves - have as many layers and contain as many traditions as the HARRY POTTER novels, including Jane Austen's penchant for misdirection, but it is certainly great fun thinking along those lines whether or not.

 And really, what more can we ask. The series IS great fun. Treat yourself and buy it. Watch it with friends who are unfamiliar and not yet addicted. You will NOT be sorry.",1360713600,,1839,4.604294478527607

Simon Baker as Patrick Jane is one of the classic TV detectives in the last twenty years; seeing what most miss

I put this in my cart months ago at $43.99 and waited patiently until it came down to the $20+ range and got surprised
the other day and got it for $22.99.

So my wife solved that problem by buying the DVD sets, now I'm hooked on this series.  The things that I really like about the Mentalist are - Almost all the 1 hour shows have a plot that ends in that show, they don't leave you hanging.  - The main characters are all very like-able.  - Almost all the episodes have a happy ending.  - There is very little, if any, profanity spoken.  The characters are all wholesome, clean and respectful.  - Extremely good acting.  -Well written scripts.

been watching it.  I'll be sad when I have to return to work.

This is not to say that Simon Baker as Patrick Jane isn't as entertaining and charming as he always is, but there is a creeping darkness that mutes the fourth season. The character's are all well played by their respective actor's but some of the innovative plots which were so prevalent in the three previous seasons seem somehow contrived or borrowed from seasons 1-3. Too many of the killings take place in venues that have already been used. But, this season is not lacking in it's ability to draw you in. There are some encore appearances by Malcolm McDowell (Bret Stiles) and Morena Baccarin (Erica FLynn) which help with continuity and an episode, ""Ruby Slippers,"" deals honestly and compassionately with female impersonators. But, the big question is, did Jane really kill Red John at the end of season three? If he didn't how can it be kept a secret? And how about all those nosy FBI agents who still have a mole in the CBI? Yes, there is still more territory to cover but, if the last two episodes are any indication of the direction the series is going to take, I don't want to go there.",1356048000,,1246,4.566964285714286

4604666,5,B0058YPJOU,"The Mentalist is one of my favourite show. All the characters have developed nicely, except for Lisbon, who in my opinion the writers need to expand upon without resorting to soap. In any event, I watch the show now as avidly as I did when it first came on the air. Simon Baker is pitch perfect as Jane most of the time. Just as he was in the Guardian, another great series, if short lived. Simon is a delight to watch because over five years,he continues to develop the character, hasn't let it fall in a rut. He's a pro in my book. Tunney and the supporting cast have done the same for the most part, though I would like to see the the Tunney character's life get a little more complex, especially as regards her interaction with Jane and without changing the interaction which is already in place. For me it is one of the handful of good to great series on TV.",1352246400,,863,4.2682926829268295

4604801,5,B0058YPJOU,"I have found The Mentalist an extremely interesting and entertaining show since its first season. After this purchase I now own all the completed seasons of the Mentalist and have watched every episode numerous times. A police procedural with a twist that is a little far out, and a cast that has created their characters in a flawless fashion, make the show a ""A HIT"" with me. Some find the constant sub-plot of the search for the serial killer Red John a little tedious, but I find the Red John 'hunt' an excellent engine with which to drive the show. It gives the show a sense of continuity and the mystery of whom are really weapons in Red John's arsenal, including a member of Lisbon's team (My own theory- and a little spoilerish - but watch for 'Red' - heh,heh,heh)further drives the tension. All in all - if you like something beyond a procedural, and like to watch relationships develop between characters as well as fine acting, you owe it to yourself to give The Mentalist a try.",1351209600,,990,4.567415730337078

Season four lived up to my expectations.  I like being able to watch any episode I chose, without commercials.

4604842,4,B0058YPJOU,"While I don't feel the series deserves 3 stars, it definitely does not deserve 5 stars. The show seems to have lost a sense of purpose and is starting to trudge through the episodes, sort of trying to just provide a new angle or innovative way to describe another killing. There was a sense of this in some episodes in season 3, and now its a bit more consistent in season 4.

4604844,5,B0058YPJOU,This is one of my favorite series and this season is better because the writers have gone back to the off beat characters that we came to love in Season 1. Season 2 was a little darker and Jane seemed bitter and not as genuine as the character in Season 1. Season 3 was better and now with Season 4 the writers are continuing on with that character development. I like all of the main characters on the show and they all have their quirks that work well with each other. I would like to see an end to Red John; I actually like these type of shows to be reconciled within one or a couple of episodes.,1348272000,,599,4.084745762711864

4604930,5,B0058YPJOU,"This is my new favorite show. I've seen every episode, including this 4th season, and definitely recommend it to fans of the other seasons.

I'm not one to give away storylines but I will say that, while I recommend this, don't be in too much of a hurry to watch it because it will leave you dying to see season 5 (which is not out yet).

Overall, this show is very intelligent and I think that everyone can learn a thing or two from Patrick Jane's skillset and outlook on life.

If you absolutely had to miss a season of this show, I would say season 2 is the least important. Season 3 and 4 are key though since that's when it starts becoming more of a story rather than a random collection of episodes. The season premier of 3 is one of my favorites, but season 4 has the ""San Joaquin Killer"" episode which is unmissable.",1339372800,4,824,4.235668789808917
4604931,3,B0058YPJOU,"It's time to bring the Red John saga to a close. The show already is too heavily bogged down with the Red John nonsense. What serial killer would bother creating a network? And what serial killer could? If there was a purpose behind his murders, such as power and gain, then that would be one thing. But he's a serial killer! I give the show three stars for entertainment, but it's still not in the same class as ""24""--which is an easy 5-star series. ""The Mentalist"" is just good mindless entertainment, and it would be greatly improved by getting rid of Red John once and for all. They should have stopped it at the end of Season 3.",1334620800,23,633,4.372881355932203

At frist I thought this was a hard core blood and more like some other shows on TV now adays. Thats one reason I was so happy that Chy loves the Mentalist as much as I do. She sees it on the TV and wants to watch The Mentalist and nothing else. This is one of the few shows that I feel safe letting her watch with or without me in the room. I have all three seasons out right now and can't wait for season four. I'm hoping that they come out with a season five.
