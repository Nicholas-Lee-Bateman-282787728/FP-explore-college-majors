I too have followed Zuzana since her ""early"" days and she has not only been a fitness inspiration but an inspiration in every aspect of my life!  Thank you. Deserves all of this success.  Long overdue!",1365120000,3,261,4.608695652173913
5693433,5,B00C7C1J68,I am so excited about this workout! Zuzka doing yoga?!  Flying burpees!!  I cannot wait to change my body with this,1365120000,3,115,4.428571428571429
5693434,5,B00C7C1J68,"Yoga-inspired workouts from Zuzka Light!  This is the best idea fitness has ever heard!  Thank you Zuzka for your continued inspiration and passion for a positive change in my life, health and fitness.  Love you!!",1365120000,6,213,5.0285714285714285
5693435,5,B00C7C1J68,Been a fan of Zuzka from the beginning and always wondered if she would tap into a yoga-style workout...and here it is!!! LOVE THIS! LOVE HER!! Cannot wait to try a flying burpee!!!,1365120000,5,181,4.515151515151516
5693516,5,B00C7C1J68,This is great for beginners and advance.  She is very knowledgeable. I also subscribe to her YouTube page.,1416096000,,106,4.888888888888889
5693517,5,B00C7C1J68,Very intense strength training. It's a great workout!,1414368000,,53,5.75
5693518,5,B00C7C1J68,Excellent!,1412121600,,10,10.0
5693519,5,B00C7C1J68,I never liked yoga but with this dvd I LOVE IT!!!,1410912000,,49,3.5454545454545454
5693520,5,B00C7C1J68,She's awesome. Looks easy but is affective,1410652800,,42,5.142857142857143
5693521,4,B00C7C1J68,"I like it because I can feel the burn, however you need to be in pretty good shape to complete the work out.",1410566400,,108,3.739130434782609
5693522,5,B00C7C1J68,"This dvd is incredible !  It tones , lenghtens, strenghs your body and is  mix with cardio exercices. Very challenging ! I hope vol 2 will soon be available for Europe ! Very useful for people who practice vinyasa yoga to get stronger !",1409443200,,236,4.340909090909091
5693523,5,B00C7C1J68,"Great workout DVD I really like her spin on yoga. You'd think it's for beginners, seasoned yogis may have some difficulties. Zuzka really is super strong, she will have you sweating and begging for mercy if you try it all at once.",1409011200,,230,4.5
5693524,5,B00C7C1J68,"There are lots of fitness personalities, but there's nobody like Zuzka. She's very smart and smokin' hot!

One thing that people should know about Zuzka is that her workout routines work! They're extremely effective at burning fat and toning muscle. I'm a guy and if I go all out I can barely finish her routines. The beauty of her routines is that they're rarely over 15 minutes. Some are less than 10 minutes! And they all work. Doesn't matter which routine you do, she has carefully planned them to make them very effective at shaping a toned and sexy body.

This Power Yoga doesn't disappoint. It's as fun as her other routines but they're a bit longer. If you want a sexy body, make time for it! You're investing in yourself when you exercise. Is 20-45 minutes worth of time not a good enough investment to make on yourself? Get up and get your butt working!

Smokin' hot chick, sweet personality, and challenging routines...what more could you ask for?",1402704000,,958,4.65680473372781
5693525,4,B00C7C1J68,Ok I rate this a 4 because it gives you an amazing workout. Not for beginners or those just starting to exercise again. This is not just yoga. There is a lot of plyo moves involved. Only negative is her instructions. No I don't agree about her accent. I can understand her perfectly. More so the instructions she gives. I have another yoga dvd that is very descriptive when explaining when to breathe and the name for each move. I can just listen and know exactly where the instructor is at without looking at the screen. But again this is not made for beginners with little arm or leg strength.,1399420800,,595,4.418181818181818
5693546,5,B00C7C1J68,"I really like Zuzka's approach to yoga.  She incorporates several strength moves, but she still provides a great vinyasa flow.",1395532800,,126,5.3
5693547,5,B00C7C1J68,"If you are looking for zen, peace and love, this is not the right option for you! For me, it started as a three minute challenge on YouTube- it was a yoga move but it was also completely insane. I was hooked! I had to get this DVD and try it. When I am having a really bad day, I throw this in and I complete twist and move all of my troubles away.",1395532800,,348,3.7162162162162162
5693548,5,B00C7C1J68,"This power yoga is very short but very intensive. I did the warm up, one section of the power yoga, and the cool down and I was sweating pretty good.",1395273600,,149,4.0
5693549,5,B00C7C1J68,If you have ever wanted to up the ante on your yoga - this is the dvd to do it.  Fast paced yet easy to follow.  Thank you!,1393113600,,123,3.357142857142857
5693550,3,B00C7C1J68,"As stated by other reviewers, the packaging of this product is a little lacking. I did not have any issues with a damaged disc though, and I have not had any issues storing the disc in the cardboard case in came in. Just be careful with it!

The workouts themselves are great, like all of Zuzka's work. However, I second the opinion of some reviewers here that it's a bit annoying to have the Warm Up and Cool Down in separate chapters on the DVD. Of course, both routines are really short and should be easy to memorize. One thing I was hoping for, based on experience with Zuzka's YouTube videos, was a quick summary prior to each workout in which she SLOWLY goes over each exercise and explains the proper form in detail. This is very helpful for people not already familiar with these poses and it helps to prevent injury. I'm surprised and disappointed something like that was not included in this DVD. I watched the routines over and over to make sure I already had a bit of a grasp on the moves and routine before I felt comfortable doing them, since I have absolutely no prior yoga experience.

Based on my mediocre experience with the DVD, I think I'll just continue using her free YouTube videos instead. There are no extra features on the DVD to make it worth the cost when you can watch her other high quality work out videos for free.",1393027200,3,1347,4.42741935483871
5693551,5,B00C7C1J68,Zuzka gives us yet another challenging workout! Great short workouts that work your body and bring relaxation. I would recommend to anyone!,1390089600,,139,5.363636363636363
5693552,5,B00C7C1J68,"This is a very difficult video,  not an easy workout, but you will feel a good workout in a very short time.",1389916800,,108,3.909090909090909
5693553,4,B00C7C1J68,Glad there's music. Good overall workout. Fast shipping and good price. Could have used a little more mix up in the moves that were being done.,1389484800,,143,4.538461538461538
5693554,5,B00C7C1J68,Great training!!!! By it!!! I lost 20 pounds with the first dDVD Zuska you are the best!!! Next step ironman,1389052800,,108,4.45
5693555,5,B00C7C1J68,A workout! I liked how its split up into segments so that you don't get overwhelmed or feel like you have to do it all. She will work you to the core. Completely different than any of my zillions of yoga DVDs. I really like it for a workout. Not for relaxing but I must say that her glistening white smile brightens my day. She's awesome!,1388620800,,338,4.136363636363637
5693576,5,B00C7C1J68,"I have been following Zuzka on Zuzka light and previously on bodyrock. She is great, offers terrofic workout routines that Are very effective. I decided to buy the cd as its easier to follow the workouts in the order than browse on internet.",1387324800,,241,4.627906976744186
5693577,5,B00C7C1J68,"I love her approach & I love the workout! She is very pleasant, gentle & down-to-earth but also motivating. Great workout that challenges me while also making me feel I can do it.",1387238400,,179,4.454545454545454
5693578,5,B00C7C1J68,"I'm not what I'd consider a yoga person.  I am neither flexible or patient and really enjoy a challenging workout.  I've always felt that if I wanted to breath for an hour, I could just stay in bed.  Well I love Zuzka's other dvds and zgym so much, I decided to give this a try.  I'm so glad I did.  It is really excellent.  My flexibility is improving, but it is also still a challenging/strength building workout.  I try to incorporate a z yoga workout at least once a week and I feel like it is improving my performance throughout my other workouts.  It is also a great choice for travel and working out in a small space.",1386806400,,624,4.228813559322034
5693579,5,B00C7C1J68,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,,155,4.777777777777778
5693580,5,B00C7C1J68,"Love every one of Zuzka's workouts that I've done so far and these yoga workouts are no exception.  Her cuing is EXCELLENT, which I find particularly important with a yoga DVD.  She tells you which pose you're going to move into as you go through the workout.  You'd think this is a no-brainer, but I can't tell you how many yoga DVD's I've had, and stopped using, because the instructor lacks proper cuing skills.  I also like the dynamic aspect and quick pace of her yoga routines.  She doesn't spend two years moving from one posture to another (okay, so maybe I'm an impatient person, but still!)  She also incorporates moves and postures that I've not seen before (push ups in tree pose - brilliantly challenging - I hate them, but LOVE them!), and are a welcome change from the same old-same old that you see in most yoga DVDs.
Zuzka puts 100% effort into everything she does, and her encouraging, sweet, down-to-earth personality shines through, motivating you as you (occasionally) struggle through some of the moves.  On a final note, the price for her DVDs is a steal - there's no reason not to try them out.  Super fast shipping and excellent customer service to boot.",1386201600,,1179,4.661835748792271
5693581,5,B00C7C1J68,"I would describe this as one yoga workout, which is conveniently broken into segments that can be tacked on to any yoga or other type of workout.  As usual, Z is an excellent instructor with an infectiously great attitude.",1386115200,,222,4.6923076923076925
5693582,5,B00C7C1J68,"Hello, Zuzuka! I like these yoga workouts, I do them almost every day, as a rule, at the eand of each workout. Sometimes I do them before going to sleep. They are fun, tough, intellegent, hot. They help me to train my balance, power, endurance, coordination, flexibility, grace. Now I am waiting for opportunity to order the next disk # 2. Don't make me wait so long. One more huge thank you!",1383350400,,392,4.458333333333333
5693583,5,B00C7C1J68,I like how she incorporates the yoga along with a good workout.  You can also choose to have music or not. She has the DVD set up so you can choose what workout you want to do. You don't have to fast forward through to get to what you want.,1383004800,,240,3.8
5693584,2,B00C7C1J68,"I had a feeling this dvd wouldn't be my style. This review is not meant to come off as mean-spirited but to inform...she obviously is ripped and gets results by what she does. However, what I look for in yoga is half physical and half mental. Her breasts have a presence all their own and they are a little too in-your-face not to notice. That and the helmet hair style had an air of superficiality and go against the mindset that I appreciate in yoga:  taking care and loving our bodies as they are.  This dvd, to me, spoke a different message.",1382832000,5,545,4.333333333333333
5693585,5,B00C7C1J68,"Zuska has been kicking out butts with the workouts she has provided over the years. All  have been amazing.

This series is by far my favorite. I go through this series each morning and i feel positive all day long.

Can't wait to receive the 2nd volume!",1382400000,,254,4.361702127659575
5693646,5,B00C7C1J68,"i always want to do yoga, this makes my day.
Thanks for taking the time to make the DVD.
i been following you on youtube",1382313600,,120,3.84
5693647,5,B00C7C1J68,"Get yourself a good yoga mat & keep a sweat towel handy :) order came in faster than expected. The DVD does not play all the way through, but that is fine with me, I can mix & match or go straight through. It does not have many modifications so just do the best you can or google the mods. You will be rolling right along with Z in no time! I like to do the yoga on the scheduled ""off days"" from her other workout DVDs. Can't weight to order volume 2!",1382054400,,451,3.860215053763441
5693648,1,B00C7C1J68,the dvd did not come in a proper case just a flimsy card board envelope.. the level of power yoga is good tho,1381968000,,109,3.782608695652174
5693649,4,B00C7C1J68,Im a complete yoga begginer and am improving with every one of Zuzkas workouts I complete. Great DVD and tutorials,1380844800,,114,4.75
5693650,3,B00C7C1J68,"This is a fantastic, difficult power yoga workout. The instructor is great, but you need to know yoga pose positioning, as this is not a beginner level DVD.

That said, the is one of the worst workout DVDs I've ever purchased because of the way the DVD menu is setup. It's really unfortunate that a silly technicality ruins such a good work out.

The approximately 1 hour DVD is broken into 7 segments (with an additional abs bonus,) with no option to play though all of them. This means that between each segment you must manually select/start the next segment. This creates a significant pause as the new segment loads, allowing your heart rate to drop. It also makes it a lot harder to stay motivated and work through the entire DVD. Once you play the last segment the credits roll, so if you want to do the ab bonus, you have to back out to the title menu to get to it. Terrible setup for a workout DVD, and it could easily be improved with a ""play all"" button or an option to preselect the segments you want to do and then play your selection.",1380240000,3,1048,4.341836734693878
5693651,4,B00C7C1J68,"Pretty awesome, but you need a basic to intermediate understanding of yoga to take this on. Rock on Z Warriors!",1380153600,,111,4.6
5693652,5,B00C7C1J68,"Loved Loved this workout!!! will be buying the other volumes:)I have seen her on youtube and decided to give this dvd a try, it was great. I love Zcut!!",1379721600,,152,4.275862068965517
5693653,5,B00C7C1J68,"This workout surprised me- its tougher than I thought it would be, but fun a the same time. I like how the DVD is broken into segments, so I can choose to do a few segments if I'm short on time. Well worth the money.",1379203200,,216,3.8222222222222224
5693654,5,B00C7C1J68,"These work outs are amazing. Burn and tone in 10 n- 15 minutes better than an hour of running, or circuit training in the gym. I don't have an hour every day, but I can always manage 15 minutes of pain for tremendous gains. Love it.",1379203200,,232,4.065217391304348
5693655,5,B00C7C1J68,"i bought this for my wife, this is a very good low intensity workout plan.
i recommend it for people whowants to get in to excersise slowly and not painfully.",1378857600,,158,4.3
5693715,4,B00C7C1J68,"This Zuzka Yoga DVD was hard and I had built up a good sweat in some 20 mins ! It is not really yoga -- she uses some basic yoga moves to make a good workout. I am familiar with Zuzka's workouts and have been doing them off and on for years now. Some of the moves are very challenging and it would be good to have modifications. It would be good to have a section that explains how to do the moves, then the different sections and then a section with all together, so the flow would be smooth or for advanced folks, who can sustain such a long workout. I hope some of these suggestions will be incorporated in future DVDs.",1378771200,,622,4.065040650406504
5693716,5,B00C7C1J68,This is not for yoga beginners. Zuzka goes through poses quickly and without detailed stance or breathing guidance. This is a great 20 minute workout with stretching. I add this w/out to the ZCUT & ZWOW series for an extra challenge. Bonus ab w/out is also effective!,1377820800,,267,4.702127659574468
5693717,5,B00C7C1J68,"Tried it for the first time yesterday, absolutely love it! Like other reviewers would be good to keep going and to not have to interrupt the flow every segment",1377561600,,159,4.517241379310345
5693718,5,B00C7C1J68,This is so much harder than it looks and Zuzka has impeccable form as usual. I love this DVD but I haven't even done the upper body series yet because I'm scared. Great for super quick workouts if you just do one routine or you can combine segments for a longer workout.,1377475200,,270,4.211538461538462
5693719,5,B00C7C1J68,I thought this was a great power yoga tape that was tough and fun to do. I recommend this tape to someone that is looking for a challenge in their yoga practice.,1376611200,,161,4.0625
5693720,1,B00C7C1J68,"This is not level one! Plus her accent makes it almost impossible to understand her instructions while you are concentrating on the exercises. Plus, the black  outfit she wears next to the purple mat makes it difficult to see what she is doing during certain poses. I hate this thing. And in reality, the thing that stands out most about this DVD are her enormous fake boobs.",1376092800,3,375,4.597014925373134
5693721,5,B00C7C1J68,"This yoga video is cardio and strength driven! There's no time for relaxation but constant flows that leave you breathing heavily and praying for a break. It's a nice change to my usual HIIT work outs, Zuzka power videos, and Jillian Michaels videos. I couldn't recommend it more! Buy it now and you won't regret it!",1376006400,,316,4.660714285714286
5693722,5,B00C7C1J68,i love your dvd thanks a lot you are my inspiration too keep going your yoga one had help me a lot from my shoulder and neck injury thanks to you am not longer need surgery god bless you zuzka !!!!,1375747200,,197,3.8292682926829267
5693723,1,B00C7C1J68,"The exercises in this video are good, but not really yoga. Each ""workout"" is just a simple series of movements repeated over and over and over again. It has no flow or variation.",1375660800,,178,4.424242424242424
5693724,5,B00C7C1J68,Would not expect anything other then a top quality. Been following Zuzka Light for over 2yrs and the changes on my body been remarkable. .,1375660800,,138,4.56
5693745,4,B00C7C1J68,"I love Zuzka. I am almost complete with ZShred, I have followed her since BodyRock, she is just awesome. I used to do a lot of Yoga which I really helped me in this video. I was a little surprised at how there was little to no explanation regarding the moves, transitioning, breathing, etc. Some of the transitions seem a little fast paced, but then again, it is Power Yoga.

I love doing this on my off days from Zshred and I find that instead of doing one section per day, I get so into it and have so much fun that I wind up doing the whole thing. It makes me sweat as much or more than any Zwow. Even though it is Yoga, Zuzka brings her own style to it. I think if it was any different people who know Zuzka would be disappointed.

I do like this because if I wanted to work just upper or lower body I can. I would give it 5 stars, but I was a little disappointed in the bonus ab workout as there are so many wonderful yoga poses to work the abs and only 1 was included. Also the section with the burpees is done too quickly to keep up, but again, you can alway pause the workout and catch up or do the section on your own.",1375228800,,1127,3.93859649122807
5693746,5,B00C7C1J68,"I have been following Zuzana for awhile now.  I am so glad she is back.  this series is great to add on to the end of another workout.  I would rate it as intermediate in fitness level.  I love her zwows and zshreds, but it is nice to put these in during the week and get my workout done with little prep time.  When I do the zwows and zshreds  I have to write them down and such.  I am also finishing up the zcut series and have ordered the z power series as well.  I can't wait to see what she does next.",1375142400,,506,3.798076923076923
5693747,5,B00C7C1J68,Very nice workout I just wish the cool down or stretches section was longer and better after what your muscles go through to do the routines I reckon it needs a little bit more cool down. But as I said brilliant and very effective workout :),1375056000,,241,4.260869565217392
5693748,5,B00C7C1J68,"Zuska's workouts are the best. She is a good motivator, and is very positive. The Series is varied enough to keep it interesting.",1374624000,,129,4.6521739130434785
5693749,5,B00C7C1J68,"I'm totaly addic of Zuzka's workouts.  This DVD is very challenging.  It's a new experience for me.  I visit her website every single day.  Thank's Zuzka, you change my life.",1374624000,,174,4.7
5693750,5,B00C7C1J68,"So far I have only done the crescent flow, but it is very fun and challenging. These workouts will leave you energized and feeling great. I noticed positive changes in my body after only a few workouts.",1374364800,,202,4.486486486486487
5693751,5,B00C7C1J68,"This yoga workout is exactly what you would expect if you have done Zuzka's other workouts. There are burpees, jump lunges, jump squats, sun salutations, and even a few mountain climbers. The workout has sections that include a warm-up and cool down so you can do as much or as little as your time and energy allow. This is not a yoga technique DVD. The exercises are basic  enough, though, that a lot of explanation is not necessary. This is a refreshing twist on power yoga and Zuzka's other workouts. The only complaint is that there is no option to play all of the segments without going back to the menu. Since each segment has a brief intro, you wouldn't flow right into the next series anyway. I am definitely looking forward to volume 2.",1374105600,,745,4.518518518518518
5693752,5,B00C7C1J68,"I'm not a yoga person but I am an ardent fan of Zuzana. Also, I've wanted to get into yoga, not necessarily learn the names of the poses and wear yoga clothes and delve into yoga lifestyle, but at least apply yoga techniques to my workouts and overall well being. Zuzana has given me what I've always wanted through this DVD.
I really like these yoga workouts. I feel refreshed, and yes tired (come on, these are Zuzana's workouts!), but clear headed after these yoga workouts.

Thank you, Zuzana and her team!",1374105600,,510,4.543478260869565
5693753,5,B00C7C1J68,"This video is a lot of fun. It mixes up the regular Yoga routine with plyometrics. Before you know it, your heart is bumping and you are burning calories.
My only criticism is that Zuzana does not explain traditional Yoga moves very well, so you may want to watch the short video ahead of time to get the proper form if you are not familiar with Vynatsa (spelling ?) flow.",1374019200,,372,4.328571428571428
5693754,5,B00C7C1J68,Very unique! I love the atmosphere and the diversity of the routines. You won't find find anything like this and you won't be disappointed.,1373846400,,139,4.833333333333333
5693775,5,B00C7C1J68,"I liked this DVD better than the Cardio series, (and that's saying a lot) I only wish there were more volumes. I really like how each workout is in a separate ""chapter"" and every chapter takes you back to the main menu. Also, it's very thoughtful of them to make the background music optional. Anyway, on to the workouts! The flow is great, but not too intimidating for newcomers (to yoga) like me. It is still very challenging though, so don't let me mislead you! Also, no equipment is required, so it really only takes the cost of the DVD to get started. I would definitely recommend this product and if Zuzana makes any more yoga DVDs I'll probably be buying them as well!",1373760000,,675,4.451612903225806

The warm up and cool down are effective and the stuff in between is amazing.  I love these workouts.  I only do a couple of the workouts at a time and find them to be intense and effective.  I use a heart rate monitor during my workouts and I consistently get a great cardio workout while doing these exercises.  Plus, I feel stretched out and refreshed when I'm done.",1373760000,,476,4.292134831460674

5693784,5,B00C7C1J68,"Zuzka does not disappoint. It is relaxing while being a tough workout as it combines strength, plyo, and stretching. The dvd does not allow you to play the entire routine one after the other, instead you go back to the main menu after completing each segment. Personally, I prefer this because I can easily choose segments to add to the end of my workouts. But to each his own. All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and I cannot wait for the release of Vol. 2!",1372377600,,478,4.382022471910112

5693840,5,B00C7C1J68,I find long yoga routines boring but this is anything but! The only pit fall I find is that you have to select each section- it doesn't flow from one to the next. None of her DVDs do but with this one it's more annoying because of the short sections. Still a great workout though so 5 stars!,1371859200,,291,4.0344827586206895

This DVD series is cut into short sections - perfect for people who have limited free time - and are difficult enough that advanced ""Warriorz"" won't get bored after a week.

5693869,4,B00C7C1J68,"I work out with Zuzka's videos for about 5 months by now. I am also a yoga practitioner and a power yoga teacher, so you can imagine my excitement when this DVD was finally available in Europe :)

I did have to set my mind off yoga when I did the workout - Zuzka gives the right explanation saying that it is INSPIRED by yoga, so it's not a real power yoga session. It a well structured session which is intensive and has good postures and a flow in it. Once you have a yoga background and know how you should breath then you can keep up well with it.

I like the settings where the workout was shot and I really like the musical background used - the last helps to maintain the tempo.

I do miss an option of playing the whole disc at once and I also missed the butt training focus :)

All in all I am happy to have this DVD and do the workout from time to time mixing it with other Zuzka's workouts.

I'm waiting for the next power yoga dvd!",1370822400,,943,3.99468085106383

Being a Yoga Instructor myself, I'm always looking for new challenges and new moves to incorporate into my classes. I HIGHLY recommend this!  She incorporates a lot of Plyometrics into the basic Warrior Asanas which amp up the workout tremendously.  You'll be sweating in 10 minutes.

This is NOT a beginner DVD!",1370822400,,448,4.717948717948718
5693871,5,B00C7C1J68,"This DVD is my introduction to yoga and I wasn't disappointed. I love high intensity and Zuzka has managed to incorporate that type of training with yoga. I was shocked that I could do the head stand preps. I mean, I'm terrified of doing cartwheels. This yoga DVD makes me want to learn how to get all bendy and Cirque Du Soleil-ish.",1370649600,,333,4.387096774193548
5693872,4,B00C7C1J68,"I will start by saying that I have been a fan of Zuzana for years, amazed by her strength and stamina on Youtube. Whenever I don't feel like working out, I put on one of her videos and that inspires me.

Because I have cortisol issues, I thought I should do more yoga rather than really strenuous workouts, and I really wanted to try her new video. I have done yoga for twenty years and I like very few yoga videos (Ali McGraw's, Brian Kest's and Stacey Rich's are my favourites).

This, however, is not yoga. It is based on a few yoga poses, but it's definitely not yoga. The cuing is okay, but I wish Zuzana would state which foot she was leading with so that I could follow her better. Also, I would prefer to do the poses on the right side first, maybe it doesn't matter but I'm just used to it that way. It's not as easy as just starting with the right foot and then the left because the foot she starts on isn't always the one that you end up in for the warrior pose - you'll see what I mean if you get the video, and it makes it hard to follow when you're switching feet all the time and she just says to start with the ""other"" foot - I found I couldn't remember which foot I had started with and it would have made it easier if she had just said which one she was using. Obviously I could look at the screen to watch her, but that's a little difficult when things are moving so fast and also I wasn't facing the same direction as Zuzana so I got mixed up quite a few times. Plus I was pouring sweat and working really hard!

People used to yoga will wonder why she doesn't put her heels down in down dog, but if you know what you're doing, then you can just do the poses as you'd like to do them.

The other disappointment was the cool down. I was surprised when it ended so soon, without the usual range of floor poses. I found I did my own sequence on my own, but I had been looking forward to being guided by the video.

A tiny disappointment was the music. It's kind of synthesized techno music, not what usually accompanies yoga. I kind of liked the music in the trailer for this video, and thought it would be more like that. I think I will turn the music off the next time I do this workout.

In the end, I think I like this, it's just that it's way more of a strength workout than yoga, and if you're looking for yoga, then you'll probably feel like me, that you have to do your own series of poses at the end.

Oh, and the shipping to Canada was really expensive considering that it's mailed in a flat sleeve and not a typical DVD case.",1370649600,,2553,4.053571428571429

This is also very different for Zuzka and I was happy to see her stepping outside the box of what she normally does. This series is true to Zuzka's style. They are short but intense. I have been doing her workouts off and on again for years and they are always enjoyable and kick your butt. If you are a more advanced athlete then you will probably want to pair these workouts with another workout. Right now I am doing a hybrid series combining both her ZCUT Power Cardio Series and the Yoga Series and I'm loving how I feel. If you have never done a Zuzka workout I highly recommend trying them.

I find it boring and hardly a workout at all, and many of the practitioners are extremely pretentious. But all that changed when I got this DVD. Zuzka brings her usual kick-butt style to yoga and makes it fun. You will definitely be a sweaty mess at the end of this one, if you do all the workouts back-to-back. Very well cued and the music is great. Great for flexibility and upper body strength. Very challenging bonus core workout. I really can't say enough good things about it. Maybe it isn't strict yoga practice, but who cares ? It's super fun and will get you results and that is what is most important.",1369958400,,752,4.265734265734266

This is nothing for people who don't have persistence. I started only with the first 3 chapters and it killed me. I slowly go forward, but I'm sure it will take time till I can do the whole DVD. But this is the sense of it. Would it be easy to do, it wouldn't challenge me. So I can only suggest buying it, and practice every day....Good job from Zuzka, as always :)",1369785600,,512,3.9805825242718447

My favorites are the Warrior endurance yoga and upper body yoga. I really have to practice those chaturangas, 'cause now I can't do them as fast as Zuzana in the warm up..

She's done a nice job with this Power Yoga series. The brief workouts combine just a few moves, which make them easy to master so you can focus more on the workout and less on watching and trying to figure out what she's doing. That approach is what makes her workouts highly desirable. This mini yoga combos are also unique, which makes them fun and challenging.",1368921600,,496,4.6477272727272725

5694071,4,B00C7C1J68,"I expected it to be more centered towards flexibility. I was slightly disapointed in this aspect because it was the reason why I got it in the first place. However, for you're an average person, it would definately challenge flexibilty. (I was previously involved in dance) After doing it a few times, I actually really like it. There's (obviously) more stretching involved than zuzana's zwows so it makes a very nice mix. It's challenging, intense, and fun. Yoga beginners with probably have a bit of a hard time because it doesn't explain the poses like it does in regular beginner yoga dvds. I liked this though because it made the workout face-paced and challenging.  I recommend this product.",1368748800,,697,4.906779661016949

But that is kinda what I like about it.  It is not boring and is very challenging.  Would be great if there was a button for all the series to play one after the other.  Can't wait to try the rest.  I am loving the Z-cut DVDs also.  I can always talk myself into 15 min of anything and find I want to do more when done.  Thanks Zuzka for creating a new way to do yoga that I haven't seen before.,1368403200,,541,3.7589285714285716

The other thing is i found the shiiping extremly expensive i payed more for the shipping than for the dvd, i was now wondering to buy the cardio series but the shipping is 15$ and the dvd's are also 15$, so i would recomend to lower the shipping was to damn expensive!! other than that dvd's ROCKS!!! :)",1368403200,,560,4.054054054054054
5694130,5,B00C7C1J68,I am a huge fan of Zuzka! I like this video a lot as a change up fom typical yoga. It's quick and efficient.

The layout of the disc is fantastic.
I love that its in a paper case because I can recycle it guilt-free and add the disc to my workout collection book.

She gives you several different workouts that you can do alone or group several together depending on how long you have to workout.  They were challenging and fun.

No problems with the order and shipping was really fast!  The only issue, like everyone else said, is that I wish it would play through. Maybe on the next volume.

Now I workout with her, doing no modifications, and I beat all my old scores. Her workouts are amazing. And now this is another great addition.

Which was fine by me because I've been so out of shape I didn't want to rush back into cardio just yet but when I saw this DVD I thought. Hey why not try it. So I did and love it. It's so extense but I manage to keep up and when I get shaky I stop and go on to the next exercise. I really didn't like I'd love this as much as I do. First exercise DVD that I bought from z.

5694189,5,B00C7C1J68,"I use Zuzka's ZWOWs regularly and was thrilled to hear about her Power Yoga DVD. The DVD includes 8 segments: Abs, Balance & Plyo, Chair Series, Cool Down, Crescent Series, Upper Body Plyo, Warm Up and Warrior Endurance. All of the workouts are very dynamic and challenging, and can be done independently or on the tail end of another workout.

Zuzka has created exercises I've never seen anywhere else, such as the Flying Burpee and Tree Pose Push Up/Plank. My only complaint is that the workouts are a little short (they range from 5-10 min), but this can be rectified by combining several segments into one workout. This is an excellent buy for less then $10, and I eagerly await the release of Part 2.",1367193600,,705,4.64
5694190,5,B00C7C1J68,"Ordered this DVD after purchasing the 3 DVD set from Zuzana. I've always wanted to try yoga, but not necessarily in a class setting.  I am so glad bought this!  I'm just learning now, and this DVD is great!  It is really challenging for a Yoga rookie like me, but I was able to follow along and I love it!  It is a good option for me to switch up between my cardio, strength training and now I can work on my flexibility as well!  I'm a big fan of Zuzana, and will continue to purchase her DVD's, they are awesome!",1367193600,,514,4.0495049504950495

She is now posting her personal workouts every week on her blog also!!  Buy it and then follow along with what she does....",1367107200,,275,4.48
5694193,5,B00C7C1J68,"This is not a beginner workout- many of the moves require the participant to have reasonable strength and cardio capacity, particularly since there are no alternatives given. That said, it is an excellent addition for someone who already does strength training. I do not do a lot of yoga (I usually find it boring, which was not the case with this DVD. It was definitely fun and challenging) and I was worried that I'd have a hard time following names of poses etc but this wasn't the case. Each pose is repeated a few times which allowed me to follow what was going on. Zuzka's cueing is good, and transitions aren't too fast, making them easy to keep up with. Each segment of the DVD, though short, is definitely challenging in itself. I definitely enjoyed Zuzka's take on yoga!",1367107200,,780,4.618705035971223

5694195,5,B00C7C1J68,"I learned of Zuzana about two years ago when she was still doing BodyRock and fell in love with her personality and style of working out!  Now I follow her own website (zuzkalight.com) and keep up with her ZWOWs.  I have never seen better results than I have with Zuzka's workouts!  They're the only thing I've been able to stick with because I love how they're super intense and effective but short and different.  There's so much variety in all of her routines that I never get bored.  The same is true for this Yoga DVD!  I was really excited and curious when Zuzana announced she would be releasing a Yoga series because that is one area of fitness I'm definitely lacking on and want to improve!  As a newbie to Yoga, I found the routines very challenging (but I expected that from Zuzana and think they would be challenging for even an experienced Yogi).  I have tried other Yoga DVDs in the past, but found the hosts boring or annoying and the DVDs were always an hour long so after doing them a couple of times, I laid them aside and forgot about them.  Zuzka's personality is calming but encouraging and so adorable that I love having her lead me through the routines and I like how there's various short routines to pick from.  This series is a definite must add to your regular workout routine to improve balance and flexibility (what I need) but you will also get great strength training and cardio!  If you haven't been introduced to Zuzana already, then this is a great place for you to start!  You will get hooked just like me and start following all of her workouts!  Enjoy!",1367020800,,1589,4.475694444444445
5694196,5,B00C7C1J68,"I discovered Zuzka's ZWOW workouts 3 months ago on YouTube and have been addicted ever since! I ordered her ZCut Cardio series - which is amazing - and when her yoga DVD came out, I ordered it on release day. I'm no stranger to power yoga but, no joke, she takes it to another level! I consider myself fit and on a more advanced level but after doing the Upper Body Plyo Series, my shoulders were on fire! Not to mention the flying burpees in the Chair Series! I struggle to smoothly  transition from candle into burpee but I plan to keep working on it. Overall, I love the short segments and the creative combination of moves and 50 minutes just flies by. My only complaint would be the fact we are unable to play the segments continuously and instead have to return to the menu screen and manually select the next routine. Not a huge deal but it would be a nice to have the option because, personally, I like to be able to practice at least 30 minutes of yoga in one sitting.",1367020800,,977,4.281081081081081
5694207,4,B00C7C1J68,"I saw Zuzka other workouts on youTube and was in the market looking for a new Yoga DVD. So I order this Zcut Power Yoga. It is not an easy workout but do the able. I consider myself a FIT person, still this workout challenges me which I enjoy it. Less than 1 hour but I sweat like I have been running under the hot sun for hours. A good power yoga workout but I would not suggest this DVD for the beginners.",1366934400,,407,3.9156626506024095
5694208,4,B00C7C1J68,"I love yoga and this DVD looked like an interesting way to increase its intensity.  I do really like this workout, it is challenging!  The Flying Burpees segment will take me a while before i can do it beginning to end but it gives me something to work toward.  It is a nice combination of cardio, strength and some flexibility. People new to yoga may have a hard time following the moves.  I would have given it five stars but I do feel like it needed more instruction on proper technique and on breathing to make the mind/body connection.  Lastly, not sure if anyone else had this problem but the DVD when used in my DVD player that I use for home workouts will stop and start constantly - I do not have that problem with any other DVD's.  I did try it in another DVD player and it worked fine.",1366848000,,796,4.23841059602649

5694210,5,B00C7C1J68,"Zuzka just keeps getting better! This power yoga dvd is one of my FAVORITES! I pair it with a Z Cut workout and get in the sweaty, hardest workout ever! The price is extremely enticing and I hit the amazon purchase button as soon as this DVD released, having been so impressed with her other DVD.

The workouts are a great, quick length if all you have time for is a short workout. You will still get results! You can even do two of the workouts together if you want a longer, yoga day. This is no yoga for sissys! Come prepared to WORK!

Would recommend this DVD to beginners up to advanced. BUY IT!",1366848000,,600,4.208695652173913

5694216,5,B00C7C1J68,Great workout. Hit all the parts of the body. I am sore today and really feel it in my abs.  It is a complex and tough workout but worth the time and the small investment.  I am 59 so age is not a factor.  Working out with Zuzka is the best.  She is an inspiration and does a great job leading the workout. I highly recommned the DVD.  Loved the setting and the workout and the option to workout with my own music.,1366588800,2,414,3.9397590361445785
5694227,5,B00C7C1J68,"I almost died when I saw this was coming out. I love yoga and I LOVE Zuzka. Her ZCUT Power Cardio program is amazing and I have been following her since her Bodyrock days.

The workouts on this dvd are totally Zuzka with her unique style and typical intensity. Unlike the Power Cardio series, you won't feel like you are dying, but the cardio bursts great for keeping your heart rate up. These are perfect for when I'm looking for more workout and less zen from my yoga. She sets a very fast pace, which is fabulous if you get bored in traditional yoga. It's also tough! Push-ups in tree pose? Flying burpees? Yes please! There are no crazy inversions or arm balances, just speed and power. Zuzka herself is sweet and motivating as always (I love her accent).

The only con for me, which others have mentioned, is not being able to play more than one sequence at once, or even a ""play all."" Hopefully in Volume 2! I would gladly pay more for that feature. Also, as a warning, if you have never done yoga or have only dabbled, the pace is QUICK, so it may be hard to follow. I suggest watching it through a few times and trying the poses individually.

Love love love! See my full review here:

5694230,5,B00C7C1J68,"I've been into fitness and working out for a very long time but have never done yoga on a consistent basis because I've always found it boring.  I've tried several different kinds of yoga (including Bikram, Flow, the kind where you hold poses for a long time) and while I like it enough and realize I need it I can't seem to do it consistently.  This DVD is great, because it breaks the workouts up into shorter segments.  I have the option of doing a few workouts, one or one long 50-minute workout.  There's enough variety and movement that I don't get bored and enough challenge to keep me motivated.

I also have the ZCut DVDs and do a lot of the ZWOWs.  I used to take hour-long bootcamp classes 3x/week and thought I had to be in the gym for an hour to stay in shape and lean.  Zuzka has proven me wrong!",1366502400,,810,4.220779220779221
5694231,4,B00C7C1J68,"Let me start first by saying that I love Zuzana!  As a fitness professional and yoga instructor, she has been a huge inspiration for evolving my own practice, so when this DVD came out, I was very excited to see what she came up with.  Now, her workouts are great, her form is amazing.  However, she does not provide very much instruction, and she provides no modifications.  When considering this DVD from a beginner's perspective, it is very challenging and potentially discouraging.  I can spot where and when beginners and less fit individuals will struggle and where I would suggest a modification as a teacher, and unfortunately, if you are one of those people doing this DVD on your own, you will have to figure that out or risk quitting (not to mention potential injury).  Also, it is a great HIIT workout, but there is not a lot of stretching/restorative type poses.  If I follow the DVD as is, I am left feeling like I need something more (e.g.; dancer's pose, reclining warrior, wide legged forward fold, pigeon...) to undo some of the intensity.

Overall, it suits Zuzana's particular style and the workout is as good as her others.  For me personally, it has provided some more inspiration for my own practice and fed me some new ideas to play with.",1366416000,,1262,4.67420814479638
5694232,5,B00C7C1J68,"I really don't like yoga, but feel I need it to balance my other workout routines. I have been following Zuzka's workouts since her BodyRock days and have always found her personality delightful, plus she had an equally delightful voice/accent that adds to her appeal, so when she came out with this yoga series I knew I would finally find yoga tolerable if not down right fun. Zuzka does not disappoint! Each routine is short and simple. Just when you think you've had enough and are ready for a ZWOW instead - the routine is over and you find yourself starting the next one. This series is great for beginners to yoga and for people like me who don't particularly enjoy yoga. I will buy more ZCUT yoga series in the future and look forward to more complexity in the routines. Love ya Z!",1366416000,,788,4.479166666666667

5694268,5,B00C7C1J68,Today I completed my first workout using the yoga series and I am very happy with how quick the yoga workouts seem to go by.  Traditionally I would steer clear of yoga inspired workouts because they would take over an hour to complete.

5694274,5,B00C7C1J68,"I have been following Zuzka for about 2 1/2 years and have never been disappointed with her routines. I completed Zuzka's new Power Yoga DVD this morning. As always, it is a pleasure and challenge to workout with Zuzka. Instruction was easy to follow without having to keep my eyes on the screen and the backdrop was calming. Zuzka has perfect form, but you know she is working hard. I am not new to yoga, but found some of these poses / movements challenging (especially the chair poses - have to work up to mastering this segment - I found it tough). The segment flow makes functional sense and even though you have to manually advance through each one, it is effortless. Zuzka is an inspiration as always and deserves credit for her ongoing comittment to our community. More importantly Zuzka is a real life role model and proves that you can take control of and shape your life at any point in time. I look forward to any opportuntiy to work out with Zuzka and have access to her knowledge. Thanks for all you do!!!!",1365984000,3,1020,4.489247311827957

I can do these barefoot, with a mat, in or outdoors, in a small area. She stays true to short workouts, proper warm up & cool down, and sweat! I love the poses for lengthening and stretching to balance her other strength routines. I can stay fit and flexible and still have plenty of time for my life:)",1365984000,,457,4.146067415730337

5694287,5,B00C7C1J68,"I *LOVE* this dvd!!! Zuzka has designed short sequences that focus on different you poses to really challenge your strength, balance, and cardiovascular endurance. Each sequence is only about 7 minutes long (except the ab bonus, which is under 4mins-- thank goodness! it's HARD!). I have found that I like doing a ZCUT workout in the morning, and then one of the yoga sequences at night. If you're only doing the yoga that day, you may want to do more than one routine, but one is plenty to get a full body workout. This includes a warm up and cool down as well, which I think is great!

YOU DEFINITELY NEED THIS YOGA SERIES!!!!!",1365811200,,629,4.517543859649122

This DVD contains a warm up, cool down, and several yoga series that kick your butt all over. They are short and pack a punch. The setting is a little different than her down-to-earth ZWOW environments, but it's lovely and not distracting. There are no exercise breakdown at the beginning of each workout, but Zuzka does a great job of explaining the flow as you jump right in.

Well worth the money!",1365724800,,507,4.571428571428571

Every time I finished with one series I told myself you can do another one but then I got to the upper body plyo and that was the last one for me today. This is really an amazing DVD.  My whole body was on fire, heart rate was up, was working muscles that I never discovered before.  I could see my whole body changing because of these combined with ZWOW's and ZCut Power Cardio.

5694293,5,B00C7C1J68,"My sister started watching her from the Body Rock days but Zuzana has only grown and improved her style. She has this adorable personality, and doesn't pretend that it's easy. She knows if its a little tough, even for her. I got her ZCUT Power Cardio Series for my birthday and loved those, so immediately bought the Yoga dvd once it was released.
I've only really previewed the workouts, but I like what I see so far. Possibly will do an update on this after a week of the new workouts.
My absolute FAVORITE is in this dvd. Not sure what she calls it, but it's a great twist on burpees. Can't wait for Vol 2!
I'd love to see her do a strictly Butt Workout series. I know she's posted some on youtube, but I think those deserve a complete dvd. And although her 'Bonus Ab' parts are nice, her abs seem like they take a lot more of a beating than those few moves! Of course diet plays a part, but PLEASE Zuzka! I would love to see you do a Butt and/or Ab dvd!

I will follow Zuzie anywhere and hope she continues her videos on diet advice in her kitchen! (very entertaining and creative) She is my hero and mentor.

My only issue is that it skips during the warmup and i was hoping the work outs were a little longer and more varied. But all in all i really like it and it is tough! i just do a couple of the routines and abs along with the warm up and cool down. You look pretty in it too! great value for the money and happy you switched to paper packaging- it  got here alot faster as well!,1365638400,,484,3.888888888888889
5694318,3,B00C7C1J68,"Let me start off by saying that I am a yoga instructor.
Also if you're not familiar with yoga poses you might find this DVD too hard to follow.
I found this DVD to be challenging and fun but there a couple of things I did not like.
There was not enough emphasis on the breath.
Zuzka did some of the postures too fast to get into them properly or feel them enough.
Her bonus Ab series was not something that I liked either: it focused basically on one move and would most likely bother a lot of people's lower backs.
Typically she gives great modifications for various fitness levels but there were no modifications on this DVD at all.
With all that being said, I did find some of this DVD to be exceptionally challenging which I liked. She did yoga Burpee's series (if there is such a thing) that I could not keep up with. Usually I'm one to keep up with anything so it was very hard!
All in all I didn't think it was a waste of money. :) most yoga classes are at least $15 and this DVD was less than that with shipping.

Don't buy this DVD thinking that it is an ordinary yoga workout (leave it to Zuzka to sneak burpees into a yoga workout.)  I am a seasoned warrior Z/bodyrocker and this workout definitely challenged me!  There are 7 segments including warm up and cool down, they are all about 5-7 minutes long which I actually really liked because you can pick and choose what you want to work on or only do a certain segment and maybe do one of her Zcuts!

5694321,4,B00C7C1J68,I did this session for the first time today and it was great!  I have always loved yoga and Zuzana definitely had a good balance of yoga and strength building moves in this DVD.  The moves in this DVD are easy enough for anyone to get the hang of and I feel like the individual sections of workouts are meant to be an add-on to what you are already doing in your workout routine or you can do the whole series through as one workout.  I do agree with another review that there should be an option to play all of the workouts through instead of having to pick from the main menu after each section especially since each section isn't very long.,1365638400,,643,4.211382113821138

For someone who has just done two months of the cardio series, I was hoping I could get through this much more easily - I was a little frustrated!  One thing I really wish had been provided:  A segment that goes through proper form on the yoga poses would have been extremely helpful.  She does this so well in the cardio series that I took it for granted it would be here in the yoga series.  I have never done yoga before but figured it would be well explained.  I was really struggling trying to figure out how to do many of the moves.  Also - the strength needed to do some of the moves is crazy.  I am giving this four stars for now - maybe I will update later if I am able to get through this and gain some much needed confidence after the first attempt last night!",1365638400,,1026,3.9609756097560975

I watched through the DVD and it looks really fun. I can't wait to try! In my opinion, it will be perfect to follow this routine with the Zcut Power Cardio Series. I will do this routine where ""Skinny tip"" is marked. With the cardio and this yoga move, there are no other better workout combos out there.

I am now on Month 2 of her Zcut power cardio. I feel great every single time after finishing the workout. Thank you again Zuzka!",1365638400,,611,4.213675213675214
5694325,4,B00C7C1J68,"First off, I have never liked yoga. It bores the hell out of me, I can't get the breathing right, and I definitely don't wind up feeling relaxed. I have been following Zuzka for about 4 years, and I feel great.

Yesterday, upon receiving the DVD, I did the warm up and the first series - Crescent. It looked so easy; it was not! I sweat more than I thought I would. I didn't get bored and had to use quite a bit of strength and flexibility. I am certain I will improve by the time I get through the whole DVD, and I am very excited about it.

It's great to have a short, minimal impact workout - compared to her typical workouts - for days I want to take it easier.

The only thing I would have wanted would be more moves in the ab bonus, but not a big deal. I didn't give 5 stars because I don't give anything 5 stars and because I have not done all the series in the DVD yet.

All in all, you're getting more than your money's worth! And if you're like me who gets bored with yoga, you will enjoy this.",1365638400,,1004,3.9554455445544554

5694352,5,B00C7C1J68,"I absolutely love this yoga DVD. I've tried other power yoga programs and got bored quick. Zuzana keeps you challenged physically and mentally. She gives excellent instruction, the music is great, and her happiness and pure love for what she is doing radiates through the television screen. :) I have a huge screen t.v. and it is like having her in the room with me. (As I've been following her since 2009, it is refreshing to see her so alive and vibrant!)

I love the warm up. It is a nice flow and increases in difficulty as it goes on.

I wobbled a lot during the crescent series and I KNOW this will help me improve my balance. It really requires a lot of focus and attention. Twisted half moon...here I come. ha! :)

The upper body sequence is challenging and I can see it helping me improve my upper body strength and endurance. I love the handstand prep. I got a lot higher by the 3rd run-through and held a full hand stand for a second. Very proud. ;-)

The chair flow is pure insanity in the best way possible. It is an excellent cardio challenge that left my legs burning and shaking! The great thing is Zuzana keeps you going and motivated throughout each routine.

The cool down is nice too. It is very short, but it is just enough to settle your body down and stretches your whole body.

I did the DVD all the way through and was drenched in sweat by the end. The moves in this are basic yoga poses with a Zuzka twist. If you like Z's ZWOWs and Power Cardio, you will NOT be disappointed. Do not let the word ""yoga"" fool you.

The routines are short (3-10 minutes each) and you move from one to the other. There is not a ""play all"" option, so you can do one, or two or all. I do not mind that there is not a ""play all"" option because after some of these routines, I was happy to see that menu screen. :)

Gorgeous setting, great music, and a radiant instructor. I don't use the word often, but this DVD is spectacular.",1365552000,28,1932,4.230978260869565
5694353,5,B00C7C1J68,"I have been a Personal Trainer for about 7 years now and I have always loved crazy, short and intense workouts. This is how I train my clients and once I came across Zuzkalight (also followed her on BR) I was thrilled!! I love her workouts and finally found someone who challenges me! I teach a class called precision, my clients call it on Yoga on crack.. Haha.. I love yoga moves but yoga DVD's and classes have always bored me! I always wanted to bust out Burpees right in middle of class.. lol.. So when I heard she came out with a yoga DVD I was crazy excited! I did the workout today and it's genius!! I feel stretched out, challenged and it got my heart rate up ! I absolutely love this yoga DVD! it has a great flow to it, it's my kind of yoga;) Thank you for another great DVD! I have them all and looking forward to more in the future!!",1365552000,5,846,4.102409638554217
5694354,5,B00C7C1J68,"If Zuzka puts her name on it, you know it's going to be a quality product. While I wouldn't recommend this yoga series for a relaxing, pre-bedtime routine, I would definitely rate it as one of the best yoga workouts I've done. I received it in the mail over my lunch hour (a day earlier than expected) and I couldn't wait to get home to try all of the workouts!

It includes the following segments. There isn't an option to do all at once, but it's no big deal to choose whichever ones you'd like to do. I've put approximate times beside each.

-Warm Up: 6 minutes
It is what it says...a warm up. It is actually a really good warm up for a yoga workout. It also reminds me that I really need to work on my chaturangas. I'm better at regular push-ups.

-Crescent Series: 7 minutes
Right now I'd say this one is my favorite. Probably because it's the first one I did and my muscles weren't fatigued yet. I could definitely feel the burn in my booty by the time I was done. This one is a bit over 7 minutes.

-Balance & Plyo Series: 5 minutes
If you're bad at balance, like I am, this one will be a challenge for you (especially if you've just done the Crescent Series). I found myself falling over a lot, but don't give up. Just keep trying and some day you'll be able to do Warrior 3 without falling, right? Well, that's what I tell myself anyway. My legs and tush were still burning after this one.

-Upper Body Plyo Series: 12 minutes
If you don't have a lot of upper body strength, this series will be hard fo sho. The handstand prep thingies surprised me.. I was actually able to almost do an almost-handstand for about half a second a few times. Anyway.. lots of upper body strength, so expect push-ups of course. She doesn't provide any alternate exercises for people that can't do push-ups, so if you can't, I'd say just hold the plank pose when she says to do them, or go down only as far as you can.

-Chair Series: 6 minutes
This one would probably have been my favorite because the flying burpees are cool as hell. But I had already the three prior series, so my muscles weren't as fresh as they should be for this one. I wasn't able to keep up with Zuzka, but I bet I would be able to if I'd have done this one first. So to all of you that are doing this DVD for the first time, do this one first--especially if you like burpees!

-Warrior Endurance Series: 7 minutes
I liked this one a lot too. It's a lot of the Warrior Pose, which I'm fond of because it's the first yoga pose I ever learned. There isn't a lot of jumping around in this one, which is good because I don't think my legs would have liked that very much. They were still burning trying to hold the poses though! Maybe I was just relieved that this was the last series.

-Cool Down: 4 minutes
It's a good cool down. I added some extra upper body stretches, and that yoga thing where you just lay there and do nothing for a few minutes. That's my favorite part.

-Bonus Abs: 3 minutes
In the first minute and a half I was like, ""Ha! This isn't hard!"" and then my abs said, ""Ha! You're a pansy!"" and then I had to take a break because I don't have abs of steel like Zuzka. :(

All in all, great yoga workout. If you're not familiar with yoga, that's okay. Either watch all of the workouts before you do them so you can know what's coming and be familiar with her cues, or google ""common yoga poses"" or something like that. Easy peasy. My arms are still shaking after doing this and I got done with the workout about half an hour ago!

I only did all of them at the same time so I could do a thorough review. I will probably only do two at a time max from now on. I will probably do the following series together:

Crescent with Upper Body Plyo or Chair
Balance & Plyo with Upper Body Plyo
Chair and Warrior
Chair and Upper Body Plyo

Of course you can mix and match to your own liking. Last thing I'd like to say is a big thank you to Zuzka and her team for bringing us another quality DVD. I love my ZCUT cardio series, the weekly ZWOWs, and now the ZCUT Power Yoga!

5694355,5,B00C7C1J68,"I ordered this video as soon as it came out and received it within a few days.  I am beyond pleased with the content and delivery of this video. Zuzka brings the best of her high intensity interval training to yoga and the marriage is perfect. I'm really grateful for this woman and her inspiring work! As a health coach and teacher, I recommend that everyone orders all her workouts and follows her blog with free 12 minute workouts posted regularly. What she has given of herself and her time for free to her internet following is amazing. Excellent workouts and lifestyle coaching.",1365552000,10,584,4.669902912621359

Plus, she also has more supporting info on her site and youtube as well. I have been following her for years and The hard work and dedication she puts into everything she does is top notch. I can't say enough positive this about Her and these Cardio & YOGA series & they are well worth the purchase price and are very reasonable. If you want results and enjoy workouts that get your heart pumping, boost your metabolism, and continue burning calories all day? Than these HIIT & Yoga workouts are the answer to your prayers :) You WILL work hard and give it all you got, then the results you get, along with the wonderful encouragement Zuzka gives all her followers is so worth it.

5694357,5,B00C7C1J68,"I love this program. I am not a big fan of yoga, but this is a great workout! Zuzka is the best, very inspiring! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone!",1365465600,,164,4.0
5694358,5,B00C7C1J68,"I just got done doing the entire yoga session for the first time -- and it was really hard, but really fun!

As a bit of background, I've been doing Zuzana's workouts for a few years (ever since she helped co-found Body Rock TV), and they are fantastic! Zuzana's (whose nickname is Zuzka, which is why you'll see her name both ways) first yoga DVD is really hard, but is definitely do-able as long as you have some yoga experience.

The DVD comes in a thin paper sleeve (not a standard plastic DVD case). It is also called Volume 1, which leads me to believe that there will be subsequent volumes out in the future.

In her Intro, Zuzka says that this is a combo of yoga, plyometrics, stretching, and strength training -- with a definite cardio focus.

The DVD contains several sequences, plus a bonus:

--Warm-up
--Crescent Series
--Balance and Plyo Series
--Chair Series
--Warrior Endurance Series
--Cool Down
--Bonus Abs Series

There is no option to play all of the Series, which is a definite disappointment.  Because I wanted to do all of them, I kept having to return to the main menu to choose the next Series.

Each Series is also pretty short -- from about 6 minutes to 8 minutes long -- so I suppose they're designed to be added on to other workouts, like her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ZCUT-Power-Cardio-Series-3-Dvd-Set/dp/B00AY5JB92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ZCUT Power Cardio Series 3 Dvd Set</a>&nbsp;workouts.  The Warm-Up is 6 minutes long, the Cool Down is about 4:30 minutes long, and the bonus abs segment is about 3:30 minutes long.  Although I didn't expect this, I actually really like the shorter segments since I tend to avoid doing longer yoga workouts that I already own; the shorter length of these means they're easy to tack on to a longer workout.

The name of each sequence gives you an idea of what the sequence is like.  For instance, the Crescent Series focuses on balance poses and crescent moves, while the Warrior Series focuses on Warrior poses.

Unlike her ZCut DVDs and internet videos, this DVD does have music, but it's very light and in the background.  From the main menu, there is also the option to choose to turn the music off.

The backdrop is also beautiful.  It's filmed in a lovely open room, with pretty views out of these lattice-encased windows.  The set is very bright and open.

Zuzka's cueing is very good, and it's easy to follow along with her without having to constantly look at the TV screen.  There is a definite athletic feel to these workouts, and my heart rate really spiked up there when she added plyo moves into some of the segments.

Zuzka is also her usual positive, encouraging self!  Even while you're huffing and puffing through her workouts, you can tell she's there huffing and puffing along with you, and that always gives me the energy to keep going!

I'm already looking forward to Volume 2!",1365465600,72,2920,4.856565656565657
5694359,5,B00C7C1J68,"Zuzka takes yoga to a whole new level!
