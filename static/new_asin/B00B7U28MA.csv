8563728,5,B00B7U28MA,"I have an early edition of this book of poetry from the children of Terezin Concentration Camp.  In fact mine must have been a 1962 edition as I received it in 1963.  It is so touching, and inspiring to read.  The will to live, the unvarnished view of life in a concentration camp, the love of beauty shine through this heartbreaking book.  Most of the children were exterminated in 1944, only a few survived.  I've become interested in one of their art teachers, Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, and have ordered more books on her and the children.  This expanded version has interesting articles, including one by Havel.",1364601600,,613,4.79047619047619
