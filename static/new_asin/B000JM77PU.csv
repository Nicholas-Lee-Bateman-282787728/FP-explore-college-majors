2677662,3,B000JM77PU,"This is an epic, maybe a Soviet ""Gone with the Wind""? Great in scale, but I think I'm not a big fan of the director. The fight scenes were a little cheesy, they seemed to be using Nerf bayonets. A simple nudge in the ribs was sufficient to send a German sprawling, never to get up again. The Russian heroine was quite dishy, even after four years in a concentration camp. And my pet peeve, using the wrong airplanes - F4U Corsairs flying over Berlin? Maybe we gave them some in Lend-Lease, although I didn't think we sent them anything good. More likely, they were filming Sands of Iwo Jima on another lot and they got a good deal on the flyover. Whatever. There had to be some Yaks around in 1950! I also enjoyed watching Goebbels hop around on his club foot like a rabbit.

Still they got some things right, for example, the start of the big attack was done at night, when Russian women switched on searchlights aimed at the German positions. Exciting stuff at the end, planting the flag on the Reichstag. Lots of tanks, men, big in scope, if not historically accurate, fun to watch.",1407110400,,1085,4.425
2677663,3,B000JM77PU,"I caught this delightful propoganda film some years ago. I was curious about the Soviet made films and this 1949 classic was made for the honor of Stalin...by Stalin.

And Boy its a hoot!!

Right off the bat all the happy peasent laborers who set immediate world records in production, afterall, each worker is a walking encylopedia of knowledge.

SEE....One field produce more grain than the entire world combined....

SEE...One steel plant product more steel in a single day than the entire United States...

SEE...Comrade Stalin in his dress whites assisting the peasents picking apples and everbody greets him.

Then came.....THE WAR!!!

That nasty little paperhanger...Hitler just had to spoil all the great world record breaking production of the happy people of Soviet Union.

But the fearless Soviet people fight back, and fight back bravely, each bullet fired kills 20 Nazis, and the Germans are lousy shots. Occassionally a Russian gets wounded..

And the Yalta conference....Churchill is a evil Man and just Stalin's presence is enough to make Roosevelt stand and walk again...all the grace of the healing powers of Stalin, why he's better than Jesus curing the blind and lepered.

Plus theres a love interest, between the peasent girl and steel worker...he's a true hero!!

Oh and when Hitler and Eva Braum are getting married in the Berlin HQ, thousands of German citizens are drowned in the metro...as a wedding present!! Wow...what a swell gift!!

But the best...oh yes my children, the best is the storming of the Reichstag, now every Soviet bullet kills one hundred Nazis and the Germans are even lamer shots. No sooner than the Soviet flag is raised, the whole city erupts in cheering, happy people!! As if a Fire ant nest was just kicked, the place erupts in people.

And Stalin himself, yes, the man himself lands at Templehoff amid hundreds of thousands of cheering people and the echos of the last rounds fired haven't faded....Man, that Stalin is good in timing!!  We see Stalin address the whole world there, sans a loudspeaker system and microphone, he projects that well to EVERYBODY.  Millions of happy soldiers and citizens and former POWS, all cheering the glorious words of Stalin!!

Oh and lets not forget that the director managed to get ahold of 3 black US soldiers (it was 1949 afterall) who were likely selected for their Step and Fetchit look about them, with ""My Oh My, Dat Stalin is a Mighty fine man!!""

But Stalin, The great and powerful Wizard of Moscow himself, leaves you with wonderful words on how great he is as a parting gift.

Maybe thats why Putin is wanting to be just like him, having taken this baited hook of a propoganda film hook, line, sinker and the boat.

If anything, this film is a great addition for over the top Soviet film made under Stalin's orders....or a great laugh.

I swear, this film literally BEGS to be Riff Tracked...Somebody tell them about this!!",1399334400,4,2921,4.886409736308316
2677664,5,B000JM77PU,"This film was made during the height of Soviet power, right after their glorious victory over Nazism. So, it represents the sensibility of that time in Soviet Union, The romanticism of that time may appear somewhat unrealistic from 21st century perspective. But, this was made in 1949, when the political vocabulary was quite different from what it is today. For an alternative version of the most important WWII events, this film is definitely a good collection.",1392940800,,463,5.105263157894737
2677665,3,B000JM77PU,"Close to being good. Sound quality poor.
Interesting to see russian language used for English characters like roosevelt.
Churchhill looks like a monster and had to much makeup.
Stalin looks like he is wearing rubber mask.
I think the acting was fine for many but not all. Just the script was poor.
Hitler was interesting and well performed I thought.
Lots of tanks and explosions and lighting good. The gun fire and person to person action is very weak and unsatisfying. The other reviews are very complete and good but wanted to add my 2 cents. Worth checking out once if your a ww2 history enthusiast.",1326672000,2,603,4.69811320754717

The best of the worst!  One if the greatest examples of revisionist propaganda.  If it wasn't such a serious time in Russian history, this movie would be laughable.  Viewed by some 42 million Soviet citizens in 1949, when first released.  Made with Stalin's personal supervision, but then banned in the Soviet Union for decades after his death.  Most of the ideals set forth in the movie are aligned with the book Falsifiers of History, published in 1948 by the Soviet Bureau of Information. .  The movie was shot on captured German Agfa film stock, which would have been superior to Russian film stock of the time.

The Fall of Berlin portrays Stalin as the one true god of war, and the personal savoir of Soviet Union, and the World, against Nazi aggression.  The film attempts to establish a link between Hitler and the Catholic Church, and blame Hitler's rise to power on western industrialists.  The film also gives East Germans a chance to absolve themselves from responsibility for the war.

Several scenes feature a manic Hitler yelling orders at his command staff.  In contrast, Stalin is shown thoughtfully delivering orders to an attentive Red Army staff.  Roosevelt and Churchill are shown at the Yalta conference meeting with Stalin.  Interestingly, Roosevelt is not shown standing or walking.  The portrayal of Churchill is at best unflattering, and he is shown as obstructing Stalin's requests.

Much of the film revolves around a love story between Aliosha, an award winning steel plant worker, and Natasha, an Elementary school teacher.  Their declaration of love is interrupted by the surprise German attack.  He joins the army to fight the Nazis, and she is taken prisoner, and sent to Germany as a slave.

The final scene of the movie is very interesting.  Stalin arrives in Berlin the day the Reichstag is stormed (in an American built B-29, three of which were appropriated in 1945 when they made emergency landings in eastern Russia after raids in Japan.)  Thousands of soldiers and prisoners of war stream into the Berlin airport to greet him, waving flags of many countries (including the stars and stripes).  Aliosha and Natasha are miraculously reunited, and personally greet Stalin.  Prisoners from several countries shout cheers for Stalin in several languages.  A POW with very thick glasses (a near-sighted American?) shouts in ""Long Live Stalin"" in English.  The music swells, and the choir sings ""Long live Stalin, we wish you health and long life.""  Btw, Stalin didn't go to Germany at the end of the War.

A heroic score by Dmitri Shostakovich runs throughout the movie.  Shostakovich probably hated Stalin for many reasons, but was forced to do work like this in order to support his family, and to protect himself from official condemnation. His work on Fall of Berlin comes in the same year as the Zhdanov condemnation.

Warning: A number of men greet each other by kissing on the lips, which would be common in Russian culture.  If you show the movie to students, they will probably find this a distraction.

Overall, the movie is grossly inaccurate, from a historical perspective.  It is an interesting look at Stalin's view of himself, and the great lengths he went to try and convince the Soviet people, and other people of the world, of his innate superiority.",1321142400,13,3770,5.055105348460292
2677667,4,B000JM77PU,"Perhaps not the most sophisticated film ever made about World War II, but this 1949 Soviet film is a rousing, solid, popular piece of filmmaking. Reportedly made as a present for Stalin's 70th birthday, who took great interest in its production, it was made with considerable production values (for that time) and in great Agfacolor film, taken as war reparation from the Germans. It's a propaganda film alright, but is very well made. As far as I know this was also the first fiction film dealing with the fall of Berlin (though the film, despite its title, deals with all the war in the eastern front, starting from the German invasion of Russia and not just its ending). I'm sure its intended audience - the Soviet masses who just have been through WW2, appreciated the movie. Hitler and his minions (who all speak in Russian in the film) are portrayed as grotesque, pathetic buffoons - but this is not necessarily a bad thing since they are the comic relief of the movie. Also fun is the portrayal of Roosevelt and Churchill at the Yalta conference, the American president is shown as nave and slightly befuddled, the British premier a mean, conniving old man. Stalin, meanwhile, is portrayed through the film as a wise, gentle, all knowing commander leading his country into victory (never mind his well documented nervous breakdown at the start of Operation Barbarossa). Summing up, despite some historical innacuracies, this is a very good film, especially for those interested in World War II.",1306281600,7,1501,4.890196078431373
2677668,5,B000JM77PU,"This long surpressed film is now available in a gorgeous restored version. To get more info on this film, and you should, read about it on Google.

The Fall of Berlin is a 70th birthday present from Josef Stalin to Josef Stalin. It was partially written, produced and directed by Stalin and though one Adolf Hitler has more screen time, Stalin's presence is everywhere, even in scenes in which he ia absent. It was direceted by a hack named Michail Chiaureli who seems to have been Stalin's favorite director. It was scored by the great Dimitri Shostakovich whom Stalin hated. Shostakovich wrote a glorious score.

For audience appeal there is a minor love story between as unattractive a couple as posssible but the story is about the famous leaders of World War Two.
Hitler, Goebbels, Goering, Churchill, Roosevelt, Mololtov, Zhukov,  Malenkov and others all appear, some fleetingly yet Stalin reigns supreme.

The Yalta Confereence is fascinating. Stalin is the great leader, Churchill is the treacherous leader and Roosevelt is simply background. It's interesting to pick out the other leaders who are...just there.

Director Chiaureli had unlimited funds and the Russian Army for battle scenes but they are disjointed as is the film. But he hits his stride in the last three scenes of this 2 1/2 hour, two part epic. All are spectacular - and very weird.

(1) The fall of the Reichstag finds Chiaureli in top form. It is beautifully done, is quite bloody - finally some Russian soldiers die - and is very effective. The raising of the Russian flag on the dome of the Reichstag is about five minutes of pure drama and, for a Russian audience, is exhilarating. PROBLEM. It didn't happen as it is portrayed.

(2)Hitler's marriaga and death is about as strange a scene as has ever been filmed. Berlin has almost fallen. Just before his marriage to Eva Braum he has the underground Metro flooded drowning hundreds of men, women and children. Ironically, Mendelssohn's Wedding Music is heard as background music during the wedding. Yet Hitler had banned the Jewish Mendewlssohn's music from Germany. It would be interesting to know who was in back of this. PROBLEM. Hitler's suicide didn't happen as portrayed.

(3)The last scene is totally unbelievable. Hitler is dead and Berlin has fallen. Stalin flies in from Russian and is met by about 800 zillion cheering, screaming, yelling and singing Russian soldiers and released prisoners at the Berlin airport. Though he doesn't have a public address system Stalin addresses the masses who go even more wild. And the film ends with a spiritual, glorious chorus praising Stalin to the heavens. The words are beyond belief but can be found on the internet. What a way to end a 70th birthday present. Happy birthday,Joe. BIG, BIG PROBLEM. Stalin never visited Berlin.

Dimitri Shostakovich, because he had to, wrote the music. Most musio critics, including Tatyana Egorovain her book Soviet Film Music, blast the score. I disagree. It is a beautiful work, easy to listen to and full of hummable tunes. The tune for Hitler's first appeaarance is simply hilarious  And if you just forget the words the airport music is unforgettable. The complete score is available on a new Marco Polo CD.

Though not a great film, The Fall of Berlin fascinates. It is never dull, it is never slow and the historical personages fascinate. I will see it again many times.",1205107200,30,3395,4.928196147110333
8152087,5,B000JM77PU,"If you are a fan of the great World War Two movies, you must see this one from 1949.  Produced by the Soviet Union in rich Agfacolor with no expense spared for Stalin's 70th birthday, it is a colossal account of ""The Great Patriotic War"" against Nazi Germany.  Sure, it is packed with corny propaganda extolling Stalin as a great, wise, humane, imperturbable, brave commander, with the Russian warriors all charging into battle shouting his praises.  We follow actor Boris Andreyev, a big, strong fellow with a deep manly voice, as he is refashioned from an enthusiastic steel-plant worker into a fearless soldier when the Nazis attack Russia.  One minute Boris is sparking with his girl Natasha in the wheat fields, then BAM!  The Stukas start dropping bombs on the wheat as a German horde of motorcyclists comes roaring up the road like Hell's Angels.  A bomb blows up Boris's mama's house and puts him in a coma for months.  He later regains his senses and vows to decimate the ranks of the Wehrmacht.  His comrades include a colleague from the plant, a Ukrainian and a Kazak Asian.  At regular intervals, we see Stalin in the Kremlin single-handedly determining war strategy and having an occasional smoke.  He is cool as a cucumber and never even raises his voice.  Over in Berlin, we see Hitler and his cast of reprobates planning to crush the Russians while Hitler hopes he will finally get help from the U.S.A and the U.K.  The actor playing Hitler is a ringer for him, and he rants, raves, cackles, and generally chews the scenery, stopping occasionally to have a snack with his adoring Eva Braun and pet his ""good doggie"" Blondi.  Anti-Western propaganda shows the Vatican envoy sucking up to Hitler, while Herman Goering toasts a British diplomat come by way of Sweden to take German orders for tank steel.  As if!  Stalin meets at Yalta with Churchill and Roosevelt and refuses to toast the King of England, being an anti-monarchist.  The final assault on Berlin is excitingly done, with hoards of real German and Russian tanks racing around and blowing up, and excellent model work of the exploding capital.  The attack on the Reichstag Building is a standout, with a profusion of Nazi officers jumping out at the Slavic dogfaces, only to be blasted, blown up, thrown over railings, or just bludgeoned with good old Russian rifle butts.  The Soviet flag is planted atop the skeletal dome of the monumental building, giving a spectacular view of destroyed Berlin.  The movie winds up with a specious arrival by Stalin in the fallen city while all the Russian soldiers and freed slave laborers become delirious with hero-worship.  ""Shtal- EEEN!! Shtal-EEEN!!""  The 151 minute movie moves fast, going from one great scene to the next, and boasts outstanding, well-decorated sets, costumes, and authentic armaments and trappings, plentiful just four years after the war.  Again, sheer Stalin-and-Soviet-glorifying ham fisted propaganda, but the courage and tenacity of the battling and suffering Russians in World War Two should never be forgotten.",1514592000,2,3057,4.964636542239686
8152088,4,B000JM77PU,"This movie has the Ham and Cheese setting turned to maximum and the propaganda is in full swing, but this is one reason that makes the movie fun to watch. The actors who plaid Hitler and Stalin are remarkably like their true life counterparts in appearance. Several other notable figures resemble the historical figures they portray. This is a typical old style war movie, with no blood, incredibly screwed odds in he favor of the Soviet army and full of bravado and slogans the whole time. It is worth he watch, due to its unique place in cinematic history, before films attempted to recreate events as the truly happened, with the realism and horrors of war. This represents a chaste, heavily biased and hokey, yet very enjoyable film.",1511654400,,737,4.765625

This movie offers the viewer a chance to transport themselves back in time, to experience a slice of what it may have felt like to live behind the Iron Curtain. Every moment is pregnant with propagandistic significance, every scene like a living Soviet Realist painting.
