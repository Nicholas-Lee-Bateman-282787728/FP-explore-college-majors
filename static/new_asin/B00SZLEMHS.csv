6998290,5,B00SZLEMHS,Brought tears to my eyes. Few outside of Lithuanians have any concept of this or the role the allies did not play for the sake of Russia's help against Hitler,1433289600,5,158,4.3
6998291,5,B00SZLEMHS,"Excellent documentary. It covers the big picture detailed in Forest Brothers by Juozas Luksa. Includes interviews with surviving partisans, soviets soldiers, Luksa's widow, former president, and even the guy who betrayed Luksa.",1429056000,8,227,6.125
8699973,5,B00SZLEMHS,"Well-crafted, well-researched documentary. Features lots of archival footage to illustrate the era. The graphics are stellar. I knew nothing about the Partisans before watching this, but still found it very engaging.",1503446400,2,216,6.0
8699974,5,B00SZLEMHS,"Showing the depth of our quest for freedom, and the extraordinary extent to which certain ordinary people will go in the struggle for freedom from domination by evil forces",1500940800,2,172,4.9655172413793105
8699975,5,B00SZLEMHS,"As is often not the case with historical documentaries, the grey area in interpretation is not only acknowledged but delved into.  The stark contrasts between a Soviet occupation spanning a decade and the Partisan collaborators who resisted until succumbing for one reason or another is sobering.  It's also eerily terrifying given that the country had gone through a Nazi occupation not five years previously.  The vitriolic divisiveness among neighbors after many of the resistance were killed or imprisoned is a testament to the Stalinesque doctrine and propaganda being brutally effective in the short term.",1484784000,2,611,5.4787234042553195

8699978,5,B00SZLEMHS,I am an American who has a long term lithuanian girlfriend. I have spent 5 months in Lithuania over three trips. This film captures the sense of national pride that stuck through the terrible circumstance of the soviet occupation. Lithuania is a very stoic nation and this film captures that through a history of the partisan movement. I recommend this to any casual 20th century European history as well as hardcore.,1479168000,2,417,4.887323943661972
8699979,5,B00SZLEMHS,"Finally, an informative resource regarding the oppression of Lithuanians and the Lithuanian resistance.  This piece of world history was not taught to us in schools so I truly appreciate all the work that went into the making of this documentary.  Interviews with the survivors and others were fascinating.  Note: be prepared to read subtitles.",1465257600,5,344,5.333333333333333
8699980,5,B00SZLEMHS,"An very good documentation of resistance fighters
against the tyranny of Communist Russia.
People need to be aware so that they don't
experience the same horrors.",1459382400,3,162,5.269230769230769
8699981,5,B00SZLEMHS,Amazing look at history. Most of us who did not live behind the Iron Curtain had no idea what was going on. The terror that western powers turned their eyes from! This is a 'must watch' for anyone who calls himself/herself a history buff.,1457049600,4,238,4.431818181818182
8699982,5,B00SZLEMHS,Great production,1448064000,,16,7.5
