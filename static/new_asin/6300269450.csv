294105,5,6300269450,"I grew up in the western part of Denmark, with the North Sea as my playground. In the late 80s I spent almost all my time (including the time where I was supposed to be at school...) windsurfing with a few good  friends. We started out in the morning, following the weatherforecast while  we packed our gear and discussed where the best spot would be, wind- and  wavewise. I think of the days as going on an ekspedition with my best  friends, doing what we were best at - and experienced that feeling (what  only surfers knows) is the best feeling in the world! In the evening when  we came back, we lit up the BBQ, got drunk, party all night - and the next  day (if there was no wind) we watched 'Big Wednesday'.  I see that movie  every once in a while, trying to recall the atmosphere from those days...it  was like time stood still... My best surffriend then (LL) allways said to  me that '-nobody surfs forever...!' - and to my great surprise he was  right... If you are an old surfer - watch this movie for to realize, that  those days where the time of your life!",948067200,3,1070,4.263681592039801
294106,5,6300269450,"This movie symbolizes the best time in every surfers life. The times when all you lived for was the biggest wave, the perfect wave, the empty wave. How many of us go out surfing and get flashbacks of all those good times  when life was free and easy? The most important aspects of this movie is  that no matter how much the circumstances of your life may change you can  always head back to the surf to gain the inner strength and unspoken sense  of of satisfaction which reminds you of just why we are on this planet, for  friendship and the worlds natural wonders. This movie re-enforced the  belief of standing by your mates and when it's time charge, don't hold  back, a great movie and unreal surfing sequences for it's time.",947808000,13,730,4.443609022556391
294107,5,6300269450,"Big Wednesday- a classic. Gary Busey is incredible as Leroy the Masochist. If you've never seen this film, I highly recommend picking it up. This movie is definitely one of my personal favorites.",947462400,2,195,4.9393939393939394
294108,5,6300269450,"This movie is regarded as a surf classic and rightly so.  Slickly produced, consisting of a series of vignettes over 13 years it gives a non-surfing person a revealing insight into the surf culture.  The  still-thorny issue of the Vietnam War is dealt with and the transition from  the swinging sixties into the seventies is handled very well (a technique  John Milius perfected in his 1983 classic Uncommon Valor which incidentally  pre-dated the much hyped Rambo First Blood II by nearly two years).  The  climax of the film is the surf footage at the end depicting the legendary  day of a lifetime, Big Wednesday.  The only negative is the thought that  the two stars, Jan Michael Vincent and Gary Busey threw away their lives  after this movie due to drug addiction (Busey almost died from an overdose  in 1994).  Another negative is that some of the surfing terminology in the  book didn't make it to the film.  In the book, the car is referred to as  ""The Makeshift"" - it isn't in the film.  Still, if you cast these  things out of your mind for 100 minutes you will experience something truly  special.  You won't be disappointed.",946857600,39,1137,4.67005076142132
294109,5,6300269450,"I love this film. It is a surf epic to be sure, but more than this it perfectly captures this period of time for me. It is beautifully written and photoghraphed, the surfing sceens are awesome. You care about these  characters. For me, that's what makes a film great. It isn't perfect but  what is? The three lead actors are certainly in their prime, and there are  some excellent supporting performances from Lee Purcell and the late Sam  Melville, among them. I have this film on laserdisc and recommend seeing it  in widescreen format if available. Don't miss this one!",938131200,5,572,4.68

294208,4,6300269450,"The first 30 minutes of this movie makes you wonder at your choice, but hang in there. This is a coming of age movie that still has meaning, set in the 1960s surfing culture. It stars Jan-Micheal Vincent (if you haven't seen him in his prime, this is the movie to watch), William Katt who gives a sterling performance along with his real mother Barbara Hale (formerly Perry Mason's secretary) and Gary Busey kind of before he became Gary Busey. It's all about parties and the waves, until graduation and the Viet Nam war. Then life becomes all too real. Two of the boys try to get out of military service (back in the days of the draft), but Katt's character goes willingly. He feels a deep responsibility to do his part. One day, the waves are coming in bigger and bigger. But it seems doubtful there will be a reunion. The surfing scenes are still epic.",1463788800,4,855,4.452229299363057

I haven't watched it in 10 years, but still feel confident enough in the quality of it to recommend it as a must buy, must see movie.  Made before the advent of special effects and computer generated images, it is a great example of a pure movie that takes you on a journey through the lives of great characters. I remember the plot of course and am excited to see it again, experience it again, and share it with my sons.  I will say it is ridiculous to buy any movie for $64, but to download it and own it for $12 is more than worth it.",1461888000,,608,3.9672131147540983

294310,5,6300269450,Being an aging Baby Boomer I enjoyed this movie a great deal. Its about our generation and a time in California that has long since vanished. It matters not a bit where you grew up in our generation. Everyone wanted to go to California. I made it and for the most part I watched the dream slowly die. Now I live in the Pacific Northwest and love it but my California years to have some pretty good memories and this movie is one of those memories.,1440288000,2,447,4.209302325581396
294311,1,6300269450,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Stupidly trite script, dull dialog, slow, slow, slow pace, lifeless acting, annoyingly ""epic"" music score (except for the occasional contemporary pop music thrown in), and obligatory fist fights. The only positive aspect of this movie was the beautiful cinematography of the Pacific Ocean and surfing, so there should have been a lot more of that. The beach location even sucked. We actually fast-forwarded through the last half hour to lessen the torture of experiencing this embarrassing attempt. Can I at least get a refund of my $3.99 rental since I'll never get the two hours back it took to get through this dog? I'm not kidding, folks.

So far I have yet to pick up on any stupid off-the-wall ""surfer"" jargon comments or remarks!  It's beautifully filmed with some of the most well liked actors (all very convincing.)

This movie was written by a surfer who had been the filmographer of such movies as apocalypse now and was sick and tired of the cheesy portrait of surfers that hollywood was producing. I think he was trying to show surfers are individuals with there own personalities who bond over a common love.,1409702400,,453,4.27906976744186

This movie follows the lives of several high school surfers in the late 1960's and early 1970's during the Vietnam War.  Jan Michael Vincent and Gary Busey are classics in their roles.,1397520000,,463,4.25

294640,5,6300269450,"""Big Wednesday"" is right up there alongside ""The Endless Summer"" and ""Point Break"" as three of my all-time favorite surfing films.  This is one of several pictures featuring legendary Pipeline surfer Gerry Lopez.  Gerry's always been one of my favorites because of how easy he makes riding the big waves look.

William Katt, Jan Michael Vincent and Gary Busey are great and Sam Melville as Bear is excellent. The bond of friendship between Katt, Vincent and Busy drives the film as they navigate their lives between surfing, Vietnam and getting drafted, jobs, pregnancy, family and death.

294843,5,6300269450,"When I first saw this film on release in 1978, many of the critics had panned it with several observing that it was only interesting when in the water, given surfing is its main excitement and the movie subsequently bombed. Looked at again 30 years later (I have in fact seen it several times in between given the cult status it enjoys in UK fringe cinemas), the film's time horizon of mid 1960s to early 1970s following a surfing mad group growing up is nowhere as bad as those critics may have indicated.

Named after the fact that most big surfing swells over the years have occurred on Wednesday, the film by using the surfing culture provides an excellent snapshot of a group of Californian teenagers maturing across the late 1960s and facing up to their changing responsibilities, with its keen observations along the way on the tension with the later hippy movement and the indirect impact of the Vietnam War and its draft on people's lives.

None of the three lead actors (two actual surfers and Gary Busey as the ""Masochist"" in gonzo mode) were going to be Oscar contenders based on this outing but what makes the performances succeed is the quality of the ensemble playing. The director co-written script  given John Milius's other writing credits is a bit clunky in parts (especially the lead personal relationships and the father figure of ""Bear""), but since Milius was a surfer from a very young age, he admits in the recent interview included in this Anniversary DVD that it is a very personal movie and an amalgam of many different characters he knew from those days.

Sure the film's surfing scenes still look fantastic 30 years on, especially in widescreen format. The accompanying short Milius interview and his Director commentary (which because of its conversational style works well in conveying his enthusiasm for the subject as well as including lots of personal observations and stories) also makes you realise the difficulties and dangers that were faced in the location shooting of such footage.

Yes, one suspects as has already been seen over the last 30 years that this little gem while bombing on initial release will outlast many other over hyped movies of the same period. This is not just just because of its surfing community following but because it is a lot closer to depicting how it actually was for many in those times.",1218499200,2,2358,4.812345679012346

294896,5,6300269450,"""Big Wednesday"" (1978) is a film that was made for baby boomers. Writer/director John Milius was born in 1944 and the material draws on a ten year span of his life from the early 1960's to the early 1970's. Along with needing a span of time to qualify as a coming-of-age saga, it was hoped that the long time span would enable it to connect with the entire range of boomers (birth dates from 1945-1963). Almost anyone born during those years will find things in the film they relate to-even shadow boomers with just the second-hand exposure provided by their older siblings. Younger viewers should enjoy the spectacular surfing sequences and might find the other stuff an interesting history lesson.

Milius is one of the so-called young auteur directors of the 70's (Coppola, Lucus, Spielberg, Scorsese, De Palma). Unlike the others he did very little after 1984, the year he released ""Red Dawn"", an embarrassingly moronic and histrionic right-wing propaganda film that alerted an unsuspecting world to his extremist political views. Hollywood insiders already knew about this and the Coen Brothers would use him as a model for John Goodman's character in ""The Big Lebowski"".

But ""Big Wednesday"" is his masterpiece and it is unlikely that any other writer/director could have brought this story to the screen this effectively. Unfortunately its surfer subject matter did not draw many non-enthusiasts to the theatre; even though the film is a lot more than surfing, containing a very original universal message about the process of living and changing. Low box office led to a re-edit for pay- television, with the more philosophical content taken out for that version. The current DVD and VHS are that shorter version so if you saw the ""Big Wednesday"" during its theatrical release you maybe somewhat disappointed.

Structured like a four act play with each transition moving the action ahead a couple of years, ""Big Wednesday"" follows three young surfers in the LA area (Jan-Michael Vincent, William Katt and Gary Busey). Each plays a talented surfer with Vincent's character approaching legendary status. Surfing plays a big part in their lives (Bruce Surtees' cinematography provides some of the most stunning views of the sport you are likely to ever see) but much of the film takes place away from the beach with scenes of parties, the induction center, Tijuana, family life, and romance (a full range of what growing up in southern California was all about). The film is book-ended with a sequence of the three surfers coming down the old concrete stairs leading to the beach.

Milius' treatment of surfing is reverential and sometimes even mystical, with a sweeping musical score and local character (Bear) who is a kind of guru for the sport. In a scene trimmed from the television / DVD version Bear explains the origin and significance of the ""Big Wednesday"" title, using the phrase ""just the lemon beside the pie"", which he then repeats when ""Big Wednesday"" occurs. Bear is the collective memory of the sport and wants more than anything to pass on his memories to a surfer worthy of them. Somehow Milius gets all this right and the film transcends what might have been a pretentious exercise in sport glorification.

Milius pays homages to John Ford,  initially with the appearance of Ford regular ""Hank Worden"" as the shopping cart man.  Later you see Ford's ""The Searchers"" (1956) reflected in the relationship between Jack and Peggy, including a scene where Peggy cradles Jack's army uniform in the same manner Martha cradled Ethan's coat.  A man and a woman who have had to subordinate their love for each other because of an overriding loyalty.

The final scene is truly special as the three main characters manage a convergence for a final day of surfing, a scene that recalls the freedom and awe of their teenage years, contrasting it with how removed they have gotten from this former way of life. Anyone who has had to choke back their emotions after a nostalgic rush reminds them of what they will never have again, will be moved my this wonderful sequence.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1160265600,6,4129,4.928057553956834
294897,4,6300269450,"The only reason I give this a 4 star rating instead of a five is, one of the most important scenes that was in the original movie was cut from the VHS and DVD version. It is during a party when ""Bear"" is talking to his friends and talks about ""Big Wednesday"" and this explains where the title of the movie came from. Without this scene the title of the movie hardly makes sense. I'm surprised that no one else has mentioned this in their reviews if they've seen the original movie years ago. I've tried for years to obtain an original uncut version and there just isn't one around. I'd rate the original movie 5 stars.",1151107200,4,618,4.2905982905982905

This is a true surf epic directed by a guy who knows the territory. The surf footage, for a hollywood movie, is truly outstanding.

294899,4,6300269450,"This is an old favorite from my younger days. It is a movie written by John Millius about a group of young teens growing up in California and surfing. It starts with them in their teen years and deals with their parties, loves, friendship and of course riding the big waves. It is a simpler and nicer time in America in the early 60's. The Beachboys and surf music ruled the airwaves and everybody was tan, hair bleached by the sun, in bikinis and swimming trunks, surf boards, your best girl and late night camp fires on the beach. But then things start to change and the Viet Nam era comes into play. The boys have to make a decision on if they are going to serve, dodge the draft or scheme to come up with a way to get out of it. Also other things are changing. Things are getting more complicated simply because everybody is growing up and has to face more serious issues than when the next keg party is going to be and when the next waves are coming in.

Jan Michael Vincent stars and looks like he is cut out of a Michelangelo sculpture. He was the early 70's adonis and he and Willian Katt and Garey Busey round out the cast. They and their friends are a colorful bunch of characters and as they go thru the ups and downs of becoming adults their friendships are tested by time and by adversity.

I think this is a really good movie. The surfing footage is also very good and I think most of the guys do their own surfing. The guy that plays 'The Bear' is also very good in his role. I believe Millius wrote this about his own coming of age and surfing so it is dead on accurate and believable. Vincent is outstanding in his performance and you can't take your eyes off of him his charisma is that commanding.",1140998400,7,1716,4.228658536585366

This film apparently incoporates some of his own memories of hanging out with friends and surfing in California in the 1960s.  The movie chronicles the story of three friends over the course of 13 years from 1962 to 1974.

The movie is similar to ""Animal House"" and ""American Grafitti,"" in the way it shows these hard-living kids, their beach parties, their wild trips to Mexico, and the way they try to avoid the Vietnam-era draft by faking various injuries and mental illnesses, etc.  In fact, the movie is more about friendship and growing up in the tumultuous late 60s and early 70s than about surfing, although there are several surfing scenes sprinkled throughout the movie, especially the ""Big Wednesday"" at the end of the film.

The movie is more profound and deep than if it had been just a surfing movie, and there's enough going on that people who aren't really interested in the surfing sub-culture will still enjoy it.",1128556800,3,1134,4.824742268041237

294902,5,6300269450,"Anybody venturing into this film thinking that this is primarily a surf film will be in for a rude awakening.  Surfing is central to the film, yes, but it is the connecting thread of the diverse lives of the film's main characters.  The film spans the period of 1962 to 1974 and catalogues the internal changes of Matt(Jan-Michael Vincent), Jack(William Katt), and Leroy(Gary Busey)as the well as the social changes that occurred during that time.  One of the more memorable sequences in the film is one where the buddies go to the military induction center and try any number of schemes to avoid being drafted.  These characters are real human beings with the foibles associated with all of us.  Any sentiment this film engenders is earned.  This is a surprisingly poignant film coming from a director, John Milius, normally not associated with sentimentality.  The film also delivers the goods as far as the surfing sequences.  The film's Great Swell of 1974 sequence is breathtaking.  I remember when this film came out in 1978 it got generally good reviews but spotty box office and release.  It did not even have a theatrical run in Philly.  Thank God for DVD where treasures like this can be rediscovered.

Milius did an excellent job capturing that era. Sam Melton aka The Bear reminded me of my Uncle Jack Blair. Gruff, fair and experienced in all things. Every town had a trio of surfers like Leroy, Jack and Matt in those days. Probably still true but I'm the old guy on a longboard now so I wouldn't know any personally. Any surfer over 45 can relate to this movie and if anybody younger than that wants to relate to older surfers like their Dads or Uncles, they should watch this movie. My only beef was that there were no Hawaiians in the movie, only haoles. There were Hawaiians surfing in SoCal in those days, passing on the Aloha. But, that's a minor thing. Funny thing, I still dress the same, even at work as I did in those days-jeans, flip flops, tee-shirt or an aloha shirt. I guess I'm still in a Big Wednesday time warp.

Big Wednesday is a semi-autobiographical story from director/writer John Milius. As many have made comments regarding the films philosophic take on life, surfing, and friends, I'll just make a few comments.

- The films pacing is slower and more deliberate than most films, giving it an almost literary feel. Admittedly, some would call it slow.

- The story is epic in scope, matching it's pacing.

- It seems to stay true to the surf culture.

- It holds great entertainment value if for no other reason than seeing Jan Michael Vincent and William Katt before their sitcom days (Air Wolf, The Greatest American Hero), and Gary Busey before....well, before his rehab days.

I think the marketing people should have released this DVD title with a different cover as it is misleading and cheapens the movie to a great degree. It is so much more deserving than that.",1079136000,,556,4.431372549019608

My friends and I lived our young lives by this movie without ever realizing the true story told in Big Wednesday is about the changing face of friendship as we grow older.  It's a story about friends being there for each other when it matters.
My view of this movie as I push 40 is that it is an insightful classic about what happens to friendship as we age.  It shouldn't be pidgeon holed as a surf flick.",1074211200,5,477,4.163043478260869

Through turbulent times and changes in lifestyle, this ode to maturity brings the point home when ""has been"" surfers still show their stuff to the young crowd during astronomical swell.
Most surf films these days are documentary in nature.  This film is more story based although the action scenes still bring on the stoke.  I would recommend this picture for any one who wants a slightly different take on beach movies.  It is nice to see Jan,Gary, and Bill in their youth.",1058572800,4,597,4.711538461538462

Not that I'm any good, but just sitting out there with your buddies shooting the breeze and catching waves together is what it's all about.  I even have a 9' board made and signed by Billy Hamilton himself with the ""Bear"" logo on the nose.  What a terrific story.  One for the collection.",1053561600,7,379,4.357142857142857
294960,5,6300269450,"This is a classic.  I think you really need to surf in order to really relate to it though.  I could see how this movie could come off cheesy (and I admit there is some velveeta going on in this one), but as a whole, it gives you that whole ""aloha"" vibe crossed with the craziness of rambunctious youth.
It's hard not to draw parallels between growing up on the beach, and watching this movie.  The innocence of youth filling their idle time with waves, babes, and beers.  Through the eventual growing pains of being forced to ""grow up"", to the eventual realization that life is a combination of fun and tragedy.
It's easy to pine for the carefree days of our youth.  It's pathetic to be ""stuck"" in that moment.  Like The Bear says:  ""growing up's tough ain't it kid?""  Like you will see with this movie.  Everyone has to discover at their own pace that life is constantly moving forward.  Youth is part of a series of moments we go through that can be packed away and taken out to enjoy every now and then.  But it is a phase.  Not Life.",1047859200,,1038,4.293814432989691

294962,3,6300269450,"I was disappointed with this movie. I did not expect the surfing coverage of ""Endless Summer"", but I expected more plot than ""In God's Hands"". Unfortunately, this movie was less than either. The actors definitely had greater skills and there was some plot, but it was more like ""Porkys"" meets ""In God's Hands"". If you want the good parts, you have to go about 90 minutes into the movie. In fact, you might want to do that after watching the intro until it gets slow. I liked the (very brief) aerial shots and some of the tube shots. Overall, though, I was disappointed.",1036195200,2,569,4.533980582524272

Wednesday also explores the ups and downs of surfing.  It's a very moving film especially if you live in SoCal and you have a lot of surfing buddies.

Anyway if you are a surfer and are interested in a bit of history on a fictional level about some of the pioneers of the sport then this is the movie to see.  Because this movie is unlike any of the other surf movies out there I can't really compare it to them in terms of whether or not it was better than them or not.  It's in a class all it's own.  From the first rate story-line to the spectacular big wave scenes at the end (spectacular for it's day that is), this movie holds much nostalgia from the 60's surf era.  If you wanna go back in time a few decades for a couple of hours and get caught up in what it was like to be part of the surf scene ""back in the day"" then this is the movie to see. From the old wine cooler beach parties late into the night to the trips down the California coast to Tijuana searching for the right surf conditions this movie captures it all and freezes it in a time capsule in the from of a two hour cinematic documentry of sorts.  Two thumbs up and then some is all I can say to end this review.",1025827200,31,1246,4.004032258064516
295055,4,6300269450,"John (""Conan the Barbarian"") Milius wrote and directed this underrated, but significant beach movie that is much more than first meets the eye.
What is most memorable is the terrific second unit big wave cinematography by famed Imax and surf photgrapher Greg MacGillivray. But the undercurrent (no pun intended) is a troubling tale that grew from Milius' memories about his own surfer buddy friendships on the day -- a big Wednesday -- when Watts was going up in flames and the surf was peaking.
Almost a great film that in retrospect was far and away more prescient than given credit at the time. Jan Michael Vincent, Gary Busey and William katt are perfect as the friends seeking meaning and purpose as they move through ten turbulent years starting in the mid-60s.
This title, like Monte Hellman's ""Two Lane Blacktop"" and Dennis Hopper's ""Easy Rider"" is a legendary film with a devoted cult following that looks at a specific time in America through the eyes of lost innocence.
""Big Wednesday"" is finally available in a pristine widescreen DVD transfer with an insightful, witty, and at times almost poetic commentary by writer director Milius.",1022544000,62,1147,4.979166666666667

This ofcourse is being compared to lame movies like North Shore, Point Break, In God's Hands, and all those stupid 60's beach party movies.  I don't consider movies like Endless Summer I and II in the same genre as any of these movies.  The ES documented actual surf adentures with real surfers.  Like I said, Big Wednesday is probably the best fictional surf movie out there.  I still think many scenes were very cliche and overdone. I am surprised at the majority of reviews.  Either they are really high or down to just one star.  While I don't think this movie deserves 5 or even 4 stars, it still is an enjoyable film.",1011398400,6,698,4.40625

295062,1,6300269450,"I've been reading as many surf books as I can find as I grew up in Southern California in the mid-60s.  Based on the fantastic reviews, I expected much better of this movie.  This is frankly, a very bad movie.  Where can I start?
Clearly a low budget movie, the sound is very low quality.  Of course, that may be considered a positive given the extremely poor screenplay.  The movie starts by a series of sketches designed to show life as a teenager growing up.  The beach, the party, the quick trip to Tijuana, the girlfriend, and the older surfer mentor.  All of them very cliched like they were almost copied.  The dialog by all characters is so poor it's virtually impossible to feel emotion for the characters.  A few weak attempts at comedy are more lowlifes.
The movie then moves in time to show the kids growing up.  The trip to the Draft Board and attempts to be deferred are almost incoherent.  But the most humorous part of this movie is Jan Michael Vincent's occasional flashes as a drunken street person.  Look quickly because he recovers by the next scene and is normal again.  Maybe it's a disease because next the elder surfer (resembles Greg Noll, da Bull) catches the drunken role disease.
As to being a surf cult film, yes there are some early surf scenes, and the ending has a solid 10 minutes of surfing as the kids are drawn to the beach 13 years later when the surf is up.  But it's not enough to sit through 2 hours of bad movie to watch some surfing.
I'm surprised this movie is rated so high by so many.  If you want a movie of growing up, rewatch American Graffiti or even Saturday Night Fever.  But not this movie.  The one large positive of this movie is watching some future stars or at least working actors and see what they were like at the start of their careers.",999216000,3,1796,4.393939393939394

Gary Busey is so Gary Busey. The rest of the actors are good at their portrayal of a trio of surfers growing up and maturing in 1960s and 70s Southern California. The movie was made in 1978, so storylines around Vietnam and cultural shifts really resonate. My father served in Vietnam (non-combat) but we haven't really talked about it.
