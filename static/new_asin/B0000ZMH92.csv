1964660,5,B0000ZMH92,"This has to be the greatest and most classic non-animated show ever to be on TV. I mean, let's face it TV these days is pretty pathetic with the exception of The Simpsons, King Of The Hill, and Family Guy which was unfortunately cancelled well before its time.
But What's Happening was a fantastic show with some of the greatest characters ever! It's hard not to smile just thinking about some of the greatest moments on that show.
I just hope the DVD has some good extras. I would love to see some recent interviews with the cast to see what they are up to and what has become of them since the show (except for Fred ""Rerun"" Barry, God rest his soul).
Either way, this classic TV show is worth having in any comedy lover's collection.",1073520000,4,735,4.372262773722627

1964667,4,B0000ZMH92,"What's Happening! was one of the under-rated sitcoms in the seventies. I have never seen the Cooley High movie so I don't know the connection but this sitcom was always a favorite until Mama's Mabel King left the show. Until then, the show revolved around the three African American friends from the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Skinny Raj Thomas (Ernest Thomas) with his friends Rerun Freddie Stubbs (Fred Berry), and Dwayne (Haywood Nelson). Raj lives with his divorced mother Mama Mabel Thomas (Mabel King) and his bratty sister Dee Thomas (Danielle Spencer). The three friends hang out at the soda shop where Shirley waits on them and cracks jokes.

The series first season was probably the best especially because Mabel King played Mama. It's a shame that she left for whatever reasons. This series was one of the few that actually showed realistic looking people in a realistic situations. Growing up in the eighties, they replayed this series in syndication. They tackled on race, obesity, and other issues with a sense of humor and sensitivity. Shirley Hemphill's Shirley was a delight too. She was a guest player who became a contract role. When Mabel King left, Shirley took over as the maternal figure in the series.

If only the DVD had any extra features, I would have given it five stars. The series was well-made in the seventies with a great cast. I enjoy it now more than ever. It's relatable about family and teen life whether in the seventies or now.",1436313600,,1487,4.850393700787402

Currently, we are looking to buy What's Happening Now season 2 and 3, but we can't seem to find them to purchase.

1964708,5,B0000ZMH92,"I am so pleased with this DVD set. It has perfect quality picture and sound. I really love the original show from the 70's but this 80's version is also great. I like being able to see how the characters progressed in life. A majority of the plot lines are interesting and very entertaining. It would have been nice if the Dee character had a permanent spot on the show and if the mother had a few guest appearances too. I have a teenage sister that really dislikes most of what is shown on television these days so I got her to watch this show and she enjoys it greatly. She keeps telling me that wishes there were more episodes. This is a clean, funny sitcom that brings you back to the days of the 80s. This show is as wonderful as What's Happening and I really hope the other seasons are released soon because I would definitely buy them.",1295568000,4,842,4.26875

1964710,5,B0000ZMH92,"I like this show. I like it a lot. It's a comedy you can watch with your family - it has no sex (just some innuendos but nothing over the top), mostly comical violence and no one acting gay. These actors have some great chemistry between them, but I guess they should since most of the cast worked together prior to this. I like how Dee is all grown up and smiles more unlike how glum she seemed in the original one.",1265414400,,416,4.085365853658536
1964711,3,B0000ZMH92,"""What's Happening"" is easily one of the best sitcoms to ever be shown on television.  The episodes were funny and innovative, the cast had natural chemistry and once you saw it, you'd never forget it.  ""What's Happening Now"" just doesn't compare.  Many of the original cast members are not present and Raj, Dwayne and Rerun have grown up and that took many cool points away from the show.  Sassy Dee shows up just a handful of times and even she forced me into extreme boredom.  Mrs. Thomas doesn't show her face one time in ""What's Happening Now""'s first season; what a pity.

 Raj is now married to a counselor named Nadine.  There is a degree of chemistry between them, but it truly looks scripted and even a bit forced.  Shirley is still around; she and Raj have taken over Rob's Place.  More than anyone, she is the exact same character that she was on ""What's Happening"", and she should be recognized for that.  Rerun is a car salesman and has the odd alias, Swame.  Dwayne is a computer programmer.  The two men reside together and, naturally, they have their share of arguments and go running to Raj so that he can mediate.  I mean come on, that is beyond predictable.  Also, Raj and Nadine fall out a few times, then make up. It's the same old, recycled sitcom plots, honestly.  A nice touch was the fact that a foster child was added.  Raj is a father!  He's a great father, too.  But even that doesn't help this spin-off go up against its predecessor.

 After reviewing all episodes of ""What's Happening Now""'s first season, I'm disappointed.  It's a decent way to pass the time, but it is very trite.",1231200000,10,1612,4.524305555555555
1964712,5,B0000ZMH92,"I barely remembered the show from when I was a kid, until I saw the original series somewhere one time and decided to buy it on dvd. I watched it, and all my childhood memories of coming home after school and watching this show with my sister came flooding back. Man those were the days. I didn't remember much of What's Happening Now!, but again I heard it was coming out on dvd, and decided to pick it up and show it to my girlfriend. She really got a kick out of the original series, but didn't know what to expect with this one. So we popped it in, and were laughing all the way to the bank.

My 2 favourite episodes have to be where Raj and the gang throw a retirement party for their old teacher who used to play pranks on them, and then yell GOTCHA!, well this time he fakes his death, and really pulls one over on the gang for one last gag, but the joke is on him!, and the other is where Rerun gets a horse, and asks Raj if he can keep it in his backyard until he can find a home for it, but the paper makes a typo in the ad which ends up saying HOUSE FOR SALE, instead of HORSE FOR SALE, and Raj answers the ad thinking the guy is coming to look at the horse, when he's really looking at the house, and the guy offers him 5 grand for the house. Really hilarious episode.

I really wish Sony would hurry up and release seasons 2 and 3. I really love this show, and would rush out in a heartbeat to buy seasons 2 and 3. I miss the hilarity of this show. Sure, fans of the classic What's Happening don't like this series as much as the original but I actually watched both as a kid and always liked this one way better. This one is just wall to wall hilarity at it's best. I really dig the 80's updated look they gave the show, and it really added to the characters I find.

So I hope one day Sony will release the rest of this awesome series so us fans can enjoy it in our dvd collections for years to come. I know I will.",1226361600,3,1930,3.943589743589744
1964713,5,B0000ZMH92,"Before I purchased this release of the first season's worth of ""What's Happening!!,"" I had originally rented the three component discs from Netflix. All of the episodes in this release (7 per disc) were extremely funny, considering that this was a '70's series. Sure, it might have been a little silly/dated, but to each his/her own-- if it makes you laugh, it must be pretty good. I wasn't born yet at the time of the original airing of the episodes in this first season, but I don't think that matters, as the first season's worth of ""WH!!"" is a whole lot funnier than a lot of the junk on today or in the '90's. I had originally been tentative about purchasing it, considering the decade in which it aired and the somewhat dated nature of the series, but, as I said earlier, Netflix helped me to make my decision in favor of purchase, as I truly enjoyed all of the episodes.

Sure, this release may not have had much in the way of bonuses, aside from some previews on Disc 1 for other Sony series, but as I've said, what matters is the season itself and how funny it was to me. I would never have said the same thing if this were ""Friends"" or ""Seinfeld"" or ""Raymond,"" as I didn't think that any of those were funny.

In total, I am glad that I made this purchase, and I believe that anyone else who is a fan of the cleaner comedy of the past should do so too.",1223510400,2,1362,4.254826254826255

1964721,2,B0000ZMH92,"The original What's Happening! is definitely one of the funniest shows of all time but the new What's Happening Now! doesn't even come close to matching the original. To compare the two is like comparing the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globetrotters. Yes, there really IS that much of a disparity among the two shows.

One of the funniest aspects of the original was watching Rerun and Shirley make fun of each other and the comedy and wittiness of the dialogue between Raj, Rerun, and Dwayne hanging out at Rob's Place. Now the chemistry is gone and the dialogue is boring and dry. Even Fred ""Rerun"" Berry left the show after the first season because he said the writing was terrible and he was right. The only redeeming quality of the new series was to see Raj, Shirley, Rerun, etc again.

Great to see the gang back together again but lousy writing ruins the experience. They should have quit while they were ahead.... <sigh>",1189123200,7,934,4.689024390243903

The simple plots center on the three endearing high schoolers Roger, Dwayne and Rerun as well as Roger's mother and younger sister Dee.  Crushed by the outcome of Super Bowl XXXVIX and its accompanying libations, I watched many of these episodes the next day for simple comfort.

1964730,5,B0000ZMH92,"""What's Happening"" was one of my favorite 70s sitcoms.  It was good clean fun and not heavy on stereotypes.  The show centered around three good-natured Los Angeles teenagers, nerdy bookworm Roger ""Raj"" Thomas (Ernest Thomas), shy naive Dwayne Nelson (Haywood Nelson) and the overeating, forever flunking, dancing machine Freddie ""Rerun"" Stubbs (Fred Berry).  Rounding out the cast were feisty waitress Shirley Wilson (Shirley Hemphill), Raj's tough, but wise and loving, mother Mabel (Mabel King) and his bratty, smart mouthed sister Dee (Danielle Spencer).  All in all they were just your typical all-American teenagers, having fun, trying to score with the girls and hanging out at the soda shop.  Dee made anyone who ever grew up with a little sister feel Raj's pain.

Remember the episode where Rerun joined a dance group called The Rockets (A group that Fred Berry belonged to in real-life known as the Lockers) that only wanted him so they could make fun of his weight?  How about when Raj showed his mischievous side by pulling a series of pranks on his history teacher Ms Collins and getting expelled for it?  Another memorable episode was where Raj shared a hospital room with a grouchy old man who turned out to be a  former Negro League baseball star.  I could watch these and many other, episodes all day!  Fans of the series should collect all three seasons on DVD.",1132358400,3,1379,4.926406926406926

1964733,5,B0000ZMH92,"I have read each online review of ""What's Happening"" in their entirety, and I read almost all positive comments.  I completely agree with all of this positive feedback.  ""What's Happening!"" is truly a timeless classic!  I first became interested in the show when BET played it in syndication everyday during the weekday.  That was years ago, and the show never left my mind.  I would think to myself from time to time, ""It sure would be nice to see an episode of ""What's Happening!""  I was elated when I saw on TVShowsonDVD.com that they would be releasing this television show on DVD.

 Roger Thomas (Earnest Thomas) is the shows main character.  He is an intelligent high school student who is quick to make a joke, but also quick to stand up for what he believes in.  He has a little sister with a big mouth named Dee (Danielle Spencer).  It seems as if her sole purpose on the show is to irritate people and get smart with them.  Roger has two best friends; Rerun (Fred Berry) and Dwayne (Haywood Nelson).  Rerun is an obese teenager who has failed classes repeatedly and Dwayne is the youngest of the three, and he makes it obvious because he seems to be scared of everything that probably wouldn't intimidate the average young man.  Roger's mother Mabel (Mabel King) is also on the show to teach all of the adolescents lessons from time to time.  Shirley is the ""less than attractive"" full figured waitress who takes no mess.

 This show is hilarious!  From Dwayne dating a girl and meeting her ex and being scared of him...to Dee taking advantage of her babysitter, to Shirley getting fired form the soda shop, anyone will find this show amusing somehow.  The chemistry of the cast makes the show even better than it is.  As other reviewers stated, a person from any generation from ages 1-100 will get a kick out of some of the things that HAPPEN on WHATS HAPPENING! 5 STARS!",1110499200,5,1883,4.580838323353293
1964734,5,B0000ZMH92,"Like most posters, I'm a first generation WH fan (I was 11 going on 12 in the Bicentennial Summer of 76 when it debuted on ABC). It was originally designed as a summer replacement series, but a deluge of fan mail brought it back that fall.

Some mighty good stuff here. The gang starts out as a bit more rougish than they would evolve. Roger in one early episode hopes for a miracle to get $ to buy his mama a present, the next scene quickly cuts to Raj & co. down on their knees shooting dice and shouting ""COME ON MIRACLE!"" Later in the same epidoe, Rerun and Dwayne steal the present in question. These kinds of antics were phased out as the show gained popularity among young people.

Then there's the episode where Rerun is asked to join the pre-hip hop dance troupe the Lockers (in real life, Fred Berry WAS a member of this group). Modern hiphop fans will be fascinated by this early example of hip hop dance. For everyone else, it's still good entertainment. The scene where Raj substitutes for Rerun as a dancer is a scream!

Young Danielle Spencer steals the show as Dee early on, as she auditions for a hamburger commercial and refuses to eat what she refers to as ""jackass meat."" What a HOWL!

The second season with Ralph the lettuce, the Givens kids, the Doobie bros., and Dwayne's attempt to sing ""handyman"" was where the show really hit it's stride, but this first set has it's share of fall-down-on the floor knee-slapping moments.

The best compliment I can give this show is that young people LOVE it.  I am friends with a family that has 7 kids, and I showed them a few episodes of this show.  Now, every time I speak to the kids, they say ""Bring over 'What's Happening'!"" and they laugh like crazy while watching it.

Say what you want of the 70's but compared to now what they networks broadcasted then was just so much more a feast for the soul and had ALOT more realness to it. I can believe the Thomas family-smart son,smartaleckly sister,dependable mom and two funny friends! And Shirly?Well....I wouldn't want to meet her in a dark ally but they don't get any cooler! And Rerun can MOVE!!I love the shows where he dances-the late Fred Barry had great rhythm and I actually felt for his character-a really nice guy who was just a little pathetic compared to the cool and intelligent Raj and the timid but plucky Dwyane. And the mother-well as she would say 'this is true'-she could even get in on the fun too even if she was for all purposes the show's thankfull nod to single motherhood.

Raj and his dancing and the way he mumbles things when he is upset is too funny. Dee is always cracking on somebody and Rerun is the true king of poplock. He was the trendsetter that started it all, before Michael, Ginuwine, Usher etc. The funniest thing was how Raj would still get the belt at 17 and they made it funny not embarrassing. In my opinion, What's Happening is far more funnier than Good Times.

Does anyone remember the episode where she got into trouble with her Mama beause she broke into somebody's diary or secret momento box but she got caught because the knife she used to pick the lock had peanut butter on it and she left behind the evidence? (A running gag on the show was how Dee was always sticking a butter knife in the peanut butter and eating the peanut butter on the knife which grossed everyone out.). One of my other favorite characters was Duane played by Heywood Nelson and I remember having a big crush on Heywood Nelson and just thnkng he was so cute!

Wholesome and fun to be with (watch), my nephew just turned 13 and he loves to 'pop this in' to watch whenever he comes over. What's amazing is the light hearted humor that is 'timeless' and any youth (or adults) can connect with it even today. I also enjoy watching a sitcom that is not filthy dirty, there's WAY TOO MUCH of this in todays TV. To quote one of the greatest stand-up comedians of the past, Phyllis Diller once said, ""In my day we HAD to be FUNNY and NOT FILTHY!"" I think with all the money paid to these TV execs. and writers, you'd think they could emulate their predecessors a little better to produce wholesome funny family shows like 'What's Happening'(maybe the talent isn't there anymore) shows like this are a thing of the past.

1964747,5,B0000ZMH92,"This show is really funny. It is amazing to watch it today and realize that most of the jokes would not even be allowed because of PC. As an ensemble cast the chemistry is perfect. My favorite character is Dee. Somehow even though she is deadpan and sometimes you can almost see he looking like she is about to laugh when she delivers her lines she is just hilarious. Sometimes the fat jokes wear a little thin but it is the chemistry between the cast that makes this so good.
Best episode is when Dee ends up pitching burgers and Shirley plays Mama who is away.
Best line is Roger when he is trying to get a date for Shirley through a dating service. The woman thinks the date is for Raj and he explains it is for Shirley when she say ""Well that is a horse of a different coclor"" Raj replies ""No she's black too"".
Like with most sitcoms this one was really bad at the end (the last season was really strained) but this first season is a classic. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.",1082505600,,988,4.178010471204188

1964749,5,B0000ZMH92,"This is a slice of television history that must be taken and passed among generations new and old to enjoy.  What's Happening is classic humor that takes you back to the days when children could be children without all the stress and pressure that come with today's times.
You had the witty and intelligent Raj, with his nerdy style and those glasses, his outspoken and spunky sister, Dee, whose ""OOH!  I'ma tell Mama...U gon get it,Raj"" had us all shaking our heads.  Then their were his boys, Dwayne (Hey, hey, hey) and the butt of all the fat jokes, Rerun (man, that brotha could DANCE!) There will never be another like him. God rest his soul. The mother was an example of the love, strength and no nonsense attitude only a single parent can have.  Mabel King was classy and added a taste of sophistication to What's Happening. God rest her soul.  Shirley (Shirley Hemphill) was also a hit, with her sharp wit and that six inch fro.  Her popular character definitely represented for the big sistas with her ""take no mess"" attitude.  God rest her soul.
I was only 7 when this came out and recently purchased this DVD set to relive those memories of coming home, plopping down in front of the television and watching people that looked just like me going through trials and tribulations everyone can relate to. You could almost taste the orange sodas, burgers and shakes at the soda shop.  Such innocence back then.  Kids of today truly don't know what they're missing.  They just don't make good-hearted shows like this anymore. I recommend getting this set and watching it with your own children.

1964753,5,B0000ZMH92,"I was thrilled to death when I learned that the first season of What's Happening!! was being released on DVD.  When I was growing up, this show was a constant staple of my after-school afternoons, but I can't remember how long it's been since I got to see a single episode.  Now, it's as if I was never separated from all my good friends: Raj, Rerun, Dwayne, Dee, Shirley, and Mrs. Thomas.  I hope the release of this DVD will restore some of the popularity that this hilarious sit-com enjoyed and will introduce the show to a whole new generation of youngsters.  I don't think I've ever laughed as hard and continually as I did re-watching these classic episodes again now, despite the fact that I've seen every episode many times in the past.  Sadly, three of the stars have passed away in recent years (Mabel King - Mrs. Thomas, Shirley Hemphill - Shirley, and Fred ""Rerun"" Berry), but I see this DVD set as a fitting homage to some of television's greatest and most memorable characters.
What's Happening!! goes all the way back to 1976; as such, it is truly one of the pioneer television shows featuring an African-American cast;  the only real agenda this show had, though, was to make people laugh and, in its own way, impart valuable lessons about growing up and life in general.  This show was basically all about family - a normal family consisting of Mabel Thomas (Mabel King), a divorced mother who works hard to support her family and raise her two kids the right way, Raj (Ernest Thomas) the smart and funny teenager with talent and dreams, Dee (Danielle Spencer) the short and sassy younger sister who could hold her own if not out-do the likes of Fred Sanford and George Jefferson in the smart wise-crack department, and - as the show evolved over the course of the season, Bill Thomas, the ex-husband and father who lived nearby.  But of course the extended family has to include close friends Dwayne (Haywood Nelson), Rerun (Fred Berry) and Shirley (Shirley Hemphill).
So what is happening here?  Well, the gang spends a lot of time hanging out at Rob's Place, the soda shop where Shirley, the sassiest waitress you'll ever meet, works.  They come up with crazy plans to get rich, make more wisecracks than you can count, and basically just hang out - they are no different from teenagers anywhere.  A lot of action takes place at Raj's home, where Mama keeps everything on an even keel, coming up with solutions to the crazy problems the kids keep getting themselves into.  Nothing goes on without Dee's knowledge, though; she has something to say about everything (especially Raj's mistakes and problems).  Dee may be the funniest character in sit-com history.  There are a lot of fat jokes on the show, most of them exchanged between Rerun and Shirley, but they are all told without a hint of malice; heck, everybody on this show gets made fun of by their friends and family, although only Dee has the art of sarcasm perfected.
There is not one bad episode among the 21 first-season episodes you'll find here.  Some, however, truly stand out.  You'll see plenty of Rerun's dance movies throughout the season, but My Three Tons has him winning a spot in a hot dance group called the Rockets; when the gang finds out that the Rockets plan on making fun of him as Fat Freddy, Mama comes up with a killer plan to teach those guys a lesson.  Then there is The Burger Queen, wherein Dee finds herself selected as the new spokesperson for a burger joint whose food she can't stand.  One of the funniest episodes is The Sunday Father; Raj may have been smart but he was not a model student; in this episode he gets expelled when he manages to pull off some of the funniest gags ever witnessed on his sourpuss history teacher.  Yet another classic episode is What's Wrong With Raj?  Mama and Raj try to teach Dee a lesson when they discover that she is breaking into Raj's desk and reading his journal, only to learn that pulling the wool over Dee's eyes is easier said than done.
Pure comedy aside, there are also plenty of touching moments scattered across these 21 episodes.  Christmas is a great family offering, as Mama frets about spending Christmas alone while her kids are spending time with their father, but of course everything works out in the end.  The Hospital Stay lets Dee truly shine.  When Raj goes in for knee surgery, Dee alone stands up to the grouchy old man in the bed beside her brother; through Dee, the whole gang comes to recognize the career of a Negro League baseball star and reunite a bitter, lonely old man with his daughter before it is too late.
I could go on and on.  Every episode here is a winner.  If you are old enough to remember What's Happening!! you already know that it represents quality family entertainment at its best and funniest.  If catchphrases such as ""Hey-Hey-Hey"" (not the Fat Albert version) and ""Uh-Uh!!"" mean nothing to you, you are missing out on a veritable buffet of comedic delights.  Knowing how much this show meant to me growing up, I hate to think of kids out there today who have never had the chance to meet this show's wonderful, unforgettable characters and enjoy comedy at its wholesome best - and to see Rerun dance.",1078876800,38,5200,4.611713665943601

The show isn't profound, but it is funny (especially Danielle Spencer's Dee) and I'd like the see the remaining seasons released.
The series was revived for syndication years later for an additional three seasons of new shows under the title ""What's Happening Now!"" with most of the cast intact.",1077753600,2,459,4.679012345679013
1964757,5,B0000ZMH92,"I bought the DVD on a whim while Valentine shopping for my husband.  It was definitely more for me than for him.  But we both love it!!!  And I enjoy introducing the ""gang"" to my 5 year old daughter.  She loves to do the ""high five"" with the snap and the point.  She's got it down pack!!!  They don't make wholesome shows like that anymore.  Nowadays parents even need to screen some of the CARTOONS children watch to make sure they're ""safe"".  I'm enjoying the shows and still laughing OUT LOUD at their antics.  And although there's no ""special features"" on the DVD, many of the final scenes of each episode were routinely cut out in syndication.  So some things are just like new for me all over again, since I was too young to remember when they were originally aired.
I can't wait to buy season 2 and 3 whenever they become available.  I hope it's soon! HEY, HEY, HEY!",1077494400,4,873,4.3602484472049685
1964758,5,B0000ZMH92,"What's Happening!!(1976) is such an essential addition to the other classic 1970's sitcoms that have already been released on DVD. The show was created by Eric Monte, writer of shows such as All in the Family and co-creator/writer of Good Times.  It also featured executive producer Bud Yorkin, already known for his work with Norman Lear on All in the Family and Sanford & Son.  What's Happening!! ran for only three seasons (1976-1979) and had 65 episodes.  The show was inspired by the 1975 film, Cooley High and centered around three high school friends: Raj (Ernest Thomas), Dwayne (Haywood Nelson), and Rerun (Fred Berry) (The nickname Rerun coming from his habit of having to repeat classes).  The action usually bounces between Raj's house, where he lives with his mother and annoying little sister Dee, and the burger hang out that Shirley (Shirley Hemphill) runs.  The show had plenty of hilarious moments and was very well written and watching Rerun dance is always a highlight!  Collected on this awesome 3 DVD set is all 21 episodes of Season 1.  The tri-fold case is one of the most colorful I've seen (inside and out).  Each DVD has one of the main guys on the face.  There isn't much in the way of extra features except for some trailers for similar releases and the much loved ""play all episodes"" feature!  I'm not totally interested in extra features when it comes to sets like these because I feel it's special enough that these classic shows get the season set treatment they get!  This set includes the following episodes:
Disc 1:
01.  The runaway
02.  The birthday present
03.  When daddy comes marching home
04.  My three tons
05.  Saturday's hero
06.  The burger queen
07.  Speak for yourself, Dwayne
Disc 2:
08.  Shirley's date
09.  The sunday father
10.  Christmas
11.  The maid did it
12.  The incomplete shakespeare
13.  The hospital stay
14.  The firing squad
Disc 3:
15.  The boarder
16.  Dwayne's dilemma
17.  The tickets
18.  What's wrong with Raj?
19.  Nice guys finish last
20.  From here to maternity
21.  Puppy love
Trivia:
*Out of the three main guys, Haywood Nelson was the only one to be of actual high school age (16) in real life.  Ernest Thomas and Fred Berry were 26 & 25 respectively!
*After What's Happening!! ended in 1979, the ""reruns"" on TV in the 80s became so popular that a spin-off with the main cast, What's Happening Now!! (1985) was created.  The show lasted for 3 seasons and like the original, centered around Raj, Dwayne, Rerun, Shirley, & Dee, only now in their adult lives.  Also of note is comedian Martin Lawrence got his start on this show as a character named Maurice.

1964759,5,B0000ZMH92,"I'm so glad that they put this on DVD!!! I was just on a website last year around this time, signing a petition to put this back on the air as reruns. It used to come on BET from time to time, but that just completely stopped. This was the show of all shows, because it taught the lessons on what friendship was really about. Three friends, a loving mother, the father (and you only saw him every once in a blue moon), a wise-cracking waitress, and who can forget the little sister who got on everyones last nerve!!! Those were the good days. And even though they're gone, they will always live in our hearts for eternity.",1077148800,,622,4.279661016949152

Almost 20 years later, I am watching the show again and it's hard to believe that this show still makes me laugh. What this show has that today's shows don't have is warmth and loads of laughs.
The set offers no commentaries or extras, but if you love the show, it's worth to pick-up at this low price.",1077148800,2,462,4.144444444444445

1964767,5,B0000ZMH92,"Unlike Sanford and Son, The Jeffersons and Good Times,What's Happening was an African American show that wasn't designed to make social issues or offend anyone(It was more or less an African American version of Happy Days).Based on the 1975 movie Cooley High,it was just a harmless show about three high school buddies hanging out, having a good time.
 The trials and tribulations of three teens,Roger ""Raj"" Thomas (Ernest Thomas) the aspiring writer, Dwayne Nelson (Haywood Nelson) the youngest of the three, and Freddy ""Rerun"" Stubbs (the late Fred Berry) the portly one who keeps flunking school, but possesses some smooth dance moves. The show also included Raj's single mom Mabel(The late, great Mabel King),his sacrastic sister Dee (Danielle Spencer) and Shirley (The late Shirley Hemphill) the waitress at the guys favorite hangout,Rob's Place.
 Debuting as a summer replacement it was an instant hit,especially to younger viewers who were spared the social issues of other African American shows. The highlights of season one include The Runaway (Raj sneaking out to a party when he's suppose to babysit Dee), The Birthday Present (The gang tries to come up with money for a present for Mabel), My Three Tons (Rerun's dreams of joining a dance group are dashed when they only let him join to tease him about his weight),The Burger Queen (Dee stars in a TV commercial for Hamburgers she don't like),Nice Guys Finish Last (After dating a girl,Dwayne is targeted by her bully Ex boyfriend).
  What's Happening lasted three seasons and 65 episodes. It was revived as What's Happening Now which also lasted for three season (Fred Berry only stayed for one season,while a little known actor named Martin Lawrence was featured in the last season).
  In the end ,What's Happening will always be remembered for being a fun harmless show,and the visual of Rerun chasing after the truck in the beginning credits.",1074384000,13,1909,5.102564102564102
