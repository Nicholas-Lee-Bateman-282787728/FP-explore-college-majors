4470681,1,B004USUP2Q,save your money movie was poorly done not as good as above the law or stone cold not on the level of easy rider,1314403200,,111,3.6666666666666665
4470682,3,B004USUP2Q,"First of all, the cover on this dvd has nothing to do with the story, so beware of that. However, bikers still may find something to enjoy, because that tends to be the focus of the plot. I found it an enjoyable 90 minutes, but it could have been a lot better. Best part is subplot of two hit men chasing Casper Van Dien across the southwest, including their encounters with truckers and a Native American jewelry salesman. Both are clever moments.
The main plot, involving a corrupt government official out to cover his tracks, starts well but falls flat by the end of the movie. I did enjoy the scenery.",1312156800,,605,4.45945945945946
4470683,4,B004USUP2Q,"I went to the showing and met the writer. I actually liked the movie and so did my fellow bikers. I found some humor in the movie and a good balance of action and a decent plot.

It is a fun movie in a complex and crappy world in which we live. I know the writer and his associates put ten hard years in making the movie a reality.  It is more than a movie, it is an accomplishment of one man's dream to put a story into a film and make it a reality.",1312070400,4,450,3.7263157894736842
4470684,1,B004USUP2Q,"Judge Tom Becker, DVD Verdict -- ""Why tell a story if you've no story to tell? Born to Ride is like an unsold pilot episode for a basic-cable adventure series, the kind that the programming wizards at the USA network would have laughed out of the room. It ambles along with no particular story or point of view, and features shoddy production values and phone-it-in performances. The half-assedry on display here is stupefying. Seriously. Ninety minutes of your life tossed out like so many Mardi Gras beads on a dull anecdote that you wouldn't have listened to for five minutes. That's Born to Ride. There is nothing to recommend about this movie. It's not exciting, it's not funny, it's atrociously acted and plotted--for the life of me, I can't figure out why this thing even exists. As far as biker movies go, I found myself longing for the comparatively grittier and wittier Old Dogs. Yes, it's that bad.""",1310256000,2,910,4.765822784810126

8442187,1,B004USUP2Q,"This movie falls within my top two worst movies I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I definitely like the guilty pleasure of an occasional ""B"" movie. As long as I'm entertained, I'm not a stickler for award-winning camera work or directing. However, this is a couple hours of my life I won't get back.

This movie goes absolutely nowhere. The plot (if you can call it that) is choppy and doesn't make sense in places. There are a couple of things I'm going to say here that might be considered spoilers, but I can't imagine anyone is going to purchase this movie after the reviews here anyway.

The gorgeous biker babe on the cover . . . has nothing to do with the movie. There isn't anyone who looks like that in the movie, nor is there anyone who dresses like that in the movie. There are several scenes which *really* heavily hint that it is a sequel to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Rider/dp/B000022TSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Rider</a>"" (and draws a LOT of parallels to it), but of course without enough to endanger a lawsuit or complaint. His father was even killed on a bike that looks suspiciously like the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Rider/dp/B000022TSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Rider</a>"" bike Peter Fonda rode (after hooking up with his mom briefly), which is completely wrecked and still in his mom's garage. He decides to use the frame from his bike to bring it back to life while pointedly admiring the antique engine for a while . . . which doesn't even end up in the ""restored"" bike.

There is a scene where he needs to replace a bunch of money stolen from him (meant for the grandson of an old veteran), so he throws an impromptu biker concert to raise money. It is supposed to be a huge crowd passing around the helmet and each person generously puts in a few dollars, and the scene is always filmed close to the stage showing ""all"" of the people . . . which I estimate to be around 12. He still raises thousands of dollars. There wasn't even enough planning to get a bunch of extras.

One thing that you at least get out of ""B"" movies is gorgeous women and nudity . . . neither of which is in this movie. There is a 1 second flash of a nipple at one point, but if you blink you'll miss it. The movie is shot in higher quality than most ""B"" movies and with a number of actors who are at least recognizable (if not well-known), but that seems to be where the entire budget went. I literally found nothing redeeming about this movie whatsoever.",1328313600,5,2569,4.766292134831461
8442188,1,B004USUP2Q,"Trust me.............this movie had some potential with the initial premise but in the end if falls terribly Flat. The Storyline had this movie trying to be to many things . At one point it sorta tried to be a comedy. Nothing worked to well. It was a concept made into a movie . The storyline was lacking as much as the acting. Trust me ....Pass on this pointless tale. It was Bad and should of been called BORN TO WASTE 90 MINUTES OF LIFE. The only thing Overall it is really a bad movie,",1317686400,,489,4.212765957446808
8442189,1,B004USUP2Q,"The story behind this movie, if true, might explain it. Apparently the film makers struggled to fund the movie for three years and struggled to pull this together. That explains why key scenes were not shot, but instead were filled in with a web cam interview frame story. The frame story does not work well to cover the missing scenes or the missing pieces of the script. This movie has many parts that seem to be homages to classic drive-in era biker movies, unfortunately they don't pull together into a working plot.

The DVD cover art is well designed and sells a movie I would have rather watched. Unfortunately it is closer to B-movie biker fare than the actual movie inside.

The 1991 Born to Ride, starring Stamos, was a superior movie in every way as a slick action war movie starring motorcycles. If you're looking for a recent homage biker film that works then check out Poker Run starring Bertie Higgins, which is not perfect but superior in construction to this 2011 Born To Ride.

This cobbled together movie is a valiant effort to create a movie but it isn't a workable story.",1315353600,,1092,4.618556701030927
