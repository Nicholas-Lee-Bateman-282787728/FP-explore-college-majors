As one of the first generation of children placed in front of a television I have seen lots and lots of cartoon characters.  Kipper is the absolute best.  The episodes are charming and endearing.  I think they teach children to be thoughtful and kind, and I feel I go to sleep in a better mood and return to work the following day a nicer person, too.
I chose this set of stories as my first Kipper purchase because it contains my favorite episode, ""The Visitor"".  You will not be able to resist falling in love with Kipper after viewing this story.",1442102400,,731,4.515151515151516

I like the videos because they are gentle, full of humor, imagination and caring.  It is also nice for the children to hear the accents and British words for ""flashlight"" -- ""torch""!  This one is a winner! We love Kipper and you will too!",977356800,4,362,4.279411764705882
