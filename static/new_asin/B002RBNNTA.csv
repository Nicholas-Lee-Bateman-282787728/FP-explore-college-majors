3972135,3,B002RBNNTA,"Mike Judge's latest effort, Extract, is both surprising and refreshing in its presentation. The director's talent for creating unique and eccentric characters is still foremost in this manifestation of troubled blue collar workers and their disastrous dealings, but a much subtler humor finds its way into the everyday situations that become proportionally expanded for comedic appeal. Yet the inclusion of generally inoffensive jocosity creates a calmer and more interesting look at the mishaps of people that feel more real than the overblown, overly exaggerated caricatures of the easier gross-out comedy. Though there are still a few miscues and unrealized potential in a handful of the humorous encounters found throughout the film, the variety of characters keeps a consistent level of amusement not found in the more crude samplings of the genre.

Joel (Jason Bateman), the owner of an extract manufacturing plant, constantly finds himself in precarious situations that steadily worsen by the minute. First, his soon-to-be floor manager acquires a serious injury in a machine malfunctioning accident that subsequently endangers the wellbeing of his company. Second, his personal life doesn't fair much better when he takes the advice of his bartending friend Dean (Ben Affleck) during a drug-induced brainstorming session on how to test his wife's faithfulness. Finally, compounding these catastrophes is new employee Cindy (Mila Kunis), who happens to be a scam artist intent on milking the company for all its worth. Now, Joel must attempt to piece his company and his marriage back together all while trying to figure out what he's really after in life.

The most effective element of Extract is the way it approaches comedy. It's subdued, relaxed and not in-your-face. It shies away from raunchiness, it doesn't overuse harsh language, and it's not overly obscene or offensive. Instead, it sits back and calmly, coolly allows the viewer to take in the situations and observe the humor that lies in everyday events, dimwitted characters, and well-intentioned plans gone horribly awry.

Bateman plays his typical role of a man who is presented as marginally more rational, understanding and intelligent than the agglomeration of simpletons that surround him. Although Kunis is also crafty, she essentially plays the same characters she always does. But character actors J.K. Simmons and David Koechner really steal the show, and for once Ben Affleck is actually funny. The supporting roles are mostly comic relief, but help to ground Joel's story in a Jerry Springer styled world, where little people with little problems live out extraordinarily disastrous lives. There's a natural humor in the events of average people, and Extract doesn't force this on the audience. Instead, we're allowed to appreciate the comedy that rises from commonplace distractions, simplistic misunderstandings and things never working out the way they're supposed to.

3972209,4,B002RBNNTA,"I got caught up in this movie on a rival streaming service that shall not be named.  Glad, on the whole, that I did.

The hook for this one is the characters.  As a story, it's only passable but the range of odd nuts that inhabit this film is gold.  Bateman plays the same character Bateman always seems to play.  Gene Simmons plays a shady lawyer.  Beyond that you've got everything in the book from hotty criminal element to racist bespectacled factory worker with the perpetually puckered face and stoner rock dude.  They all play together in a way that results in lots of laugh-out-loud moments.  J.K. Simmons caps off the nuttiness wonderfully with his typical overly push salesman antics.

The story, as previously alluded to, is fairly predictable.  The things you expect to happen.... well, they happen.  Everything ends on the upswing and rather sappily, plus or minus an untimely death or two.",1451433600,,903,4.798701298701299
3972210,4,B002RBNNTA,"Jason Bateman has a very subtle, yet pretty funny sense of humor.  Mila Kunis brings a great character to the story, and Kristen Wiig does great job of portraying a realistic wife, yet keeping a sense of light humor about the situations that unfold in this movie.  The acting is great, and it can be a bit slow at a certain point in the beginning - but it is a light, humorous movie, with a clean, bright picture; a meticulous set, and some nice views inside of a very clean factory and homes.  I've watched this movie twice now.  I'm not a movie re-watcher by any means.  They have to be good.  This is a good movie, with an interesting plot that twists a few times, and is definitely worth watching at least once.",1449964800,2,715,4.298507462686567

Considering this was a lower budget film no one has ever heard of, it was really funny! It has an all star cast. Jason Bateman, Ben Affleck, Kristin Wigg, Mila Kunis, and like a dozen other actors you'll immediately recognize.

It's a funny story overall. It's not knee slapping hysteria for 90 minutes. But it's a steady stream of laughter.

It's called Extract because Jason Bateman owns a small manufacturing company that makes things like vanilla extract and orange extract and stuff like that. The story is quirky, but it's very inventive and well thought out.

Of course after seeing the classic 'Office Space,' I thought that Judge's wit would be as good in this movie, but it disappoints. Conversations drag on and are labored at times. Trying to work in a subtle humor slows down the pace of the movie and becomes tiring by the end. Is it funny? Certainly. There are some good laughs to be had here, but it comes at a price in the pacing.

3972783,2,B002RBNNTA,"THE PLOT: Joel (Jason Bateman) is the owner of an extract production plant that he built himself from the ground up. In spite of his success, he struggles with a frigid and distant wife (Kristin Wiig) and more than a few completely incompetent employees (TJ Miller and Beth Grant foremost among them). The latter end up causing a horrific on-site accident that could bankrupt the company. Making matters worse, the under-sexed Joel is distracted by the appearance of a sexy new employee, Cindy (Mila Kunis). Joel must try to keep his company from going under while dealing with his unsatisfying marriage and his nosy neighbor (David Koechner).

THE GOOD: There are a few funny moments in the movie, most of them at the hands of Koechner and some of Joel's workers. Ben Affleck, if you can believe it, steals more than a few scenes as Joel's drug-obsessed slacker friend (why straight-laced Joel would ever have such a friend is one of those mysteries that movies like these ask you to avoid thinking about). Bateman does his usual shtick; although I think his wide-eyed eager act is starting to get a little annoying (how many times is he going to keep reverting to his standard Michael Bluth persona?), it's at least consistent.

THE BAD: Most of the people here are phoning it in. Kristin Wiig is completely under-utilized in her thankless role as the jilted/jilting wife, and Mila Kunis doesn't appear to be trying to act at all. This is probably due to the sloppy script. Mila's Cindy appears to have no real motivation or personality at all; her name could just as easily be ""Plot Contrivance #3."" Joel's attempts to fix his work and life problems are all half-hearted, ridiculous, and just as contrived. His workers cause a vicious accident, setting Joel up for a massive lawsuit, but no one is fired. It is hard to sympathize with a man who willfully employs complete idiots. Bothered by his wife's lack of interest in the bedroom, Joel creates an elaborate plan to give him license to cheat, and when this plan falters, he behaves like a clueless child rather than a man who started and runs his own business.

There are some elements here that could work, had they been tied more neatly together. If Judge had tried to pin a message, moral, underlying theme, or even a single joke to the entire spine of the story, it might have given it at least some cohesion. Instead, the movie appears to be a slap-dash conglomeration of scenes that have very little to do with each other, and which aren't acted, written, or directed in any kind of new or interesting way. The movie ends almost as if it had never started, and the various conflicts/stories just kind of fade away rather than conclude meaningfully. Some funny moments, but altogether a disappointing effort from a normally enjoyable filmmaker.",1338249600,6,2806,4.769547325102881

3972786,2,B002RBNNTA,"As a satirist of popular culture, Mike Judge is comparable to Stan Freberg. (I know -- no one reading this knows who Stan Freberg is. Look him up.) ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" is a remarkable documentation of the irreversible decline of American society, and ""Office Space"" and ""Idiocracy"" are classics of social criticism. (I can't think of a less-pretentious term.) ""King of the Hill"" isn't quite so good, but I ascribe that to Fox's insistence there be no extended story arcs.

""Extract"" is a disaster. It's a 60-minute idea padded to 90 minutes with over-written dialog. (It takes an hour to get to the point it should have reached at 30 minutes.) Worse, there's no obvious dramatic or comic ""point"" to the story to drive it. Judge's direction is uncharacteristically sloppy and unfocused. And unbelievably, Judge has had David Koechner (whom you probably know better as T-Bones) duplicate Gary Cole's delivery in ""Office Space"".

These things might not have been as important if the film were funny. It isn't. It has one or two funny lines, and that's it.

A good script reader would have caught most of the story's problems -- in particular, that there really is no story there -- but I suspect Mr Judge has reached that point of success where you no longer have friends who will tell you the truth.

3972788,3,B002RBNNTA,"I've been waiting or this movie. Loved Office Space, even really enjoyed Idiocracy. I heard some mixed reviews which tempered my expectations, but even so, this was a disappointing and very uneven movie.

Jason Bateman plays his straight-laced, deadpan comedy to the hilt, much as he did in Arrested Development. He is Joel, the owner of a factory employing a real assortment of underachieving, funny characters. With an offer from General Mills to buy the plant and make him rich, Joel looks forward to early retirement. On the home front, he is a sexually frustrated husband with an unreceptive wife and an unrelentingly dull neighbor.

With moments of genius, the movie was also dragged down by some poor realization of comedic potential. Kristin Wiig, a funny and versatile comedienne, is wasted as the housewife, and although she certainly has enough scenes, the writing doesn't allow her to perform.

The various subplots didn't mesh as well as I expected. Instead of a complete tale, this felt like a few sitcom episodes woven together.

That said, there are some great scenes. You will never think about call-waiting again. The personal injury lawyer is fantastic. Ben Affleck does a fine job as the slacker friend.

There's also gratuitous Ben Affleck. Two super annoying woman who work the assembly line at this plant where most of the movie takes place. Throw in a completely gratuitous Kristen Wiig whose talents are completely wasted by her minimal screentime.

The most unfunny part of the movie is the overly long scenes of Bateman's neighbor who lies in wait every day to talk to Bateman as he pulls into his driveway.

Yes, Mike Judge did Office Space but, let's be blunt even about that classic B movie, it's still not perfect. There is a lot of dead time in Judge's movies where nothing happens and the actors read lines in these monotones that, I guess, are supposed to show us how mundane life is working in an office...or a plant in Extract's case. Whatever the reason is, Judge needs to move away from this whole ""workplace is a quiet hell"" jag he's obsessed with and do something else.

3972796,4,B002RBNNTA,"Joel Reynolds (Jason Bateman) owns Reyonld's Extract, an extract company that he started on his own.  It's a successful business with a ""family"" atmosphere, e.g. Joel knows the name of everyone of his employees, Joel's office is easily accessible by anyone, and one side filled with windows that can be seen from the manufacturing floor.  It seems that Joel has a good life, but Joel is frustrated.  His wife, Suzie (Kristin Wiig) has been keeping him sexually frustrated for months on end.  He likes his company, but he works so much that he believes it's one of the contributing factors in his wife's lack of interest.  He has an annoying neighbor, named Nathan (David Koechner), that snoops around and won't leave him alone.  Then General Mills calls with a proposed buyout.  Joel begins to believe he will be able to retire wealthy and spend more time with his wife.  All of that becomes endangered when a loyal employee, Step (Clifton Collins, Jr.) is the victim of a freak accident.  A female drifting con named Cindy (Mila Kunis) learns about the accident.  She gets a temp job at Reynold's and flirts with Joel.  Meanwhile, she secretly begins dating Step in an attempt to get him to sue Reynold's Extract for millions of dollars.  Joel doesn't know what to do and seeks help from his drugged-out best friend, Dean (Ben Affleck) which leads to a series of farcical events.

There are some well done performances in the movie.  Jason Bateman is usually always a joy to watch.  He's typecast as the good father who is just trying to build a good life but is surrounded by crazy family and friends, but no one can play that role so well.  Ben Affleck gives one of his best performances in years; Affleck plays crazy kooks much better than he does dramatic, serious leading men.  Mila Kunis is very pretty, but Cindy really isn't much more than a plot device.  Kristin Wiig is a really funny actress, but other than one or two moments her comedic abilities are restrained.  Some will probably be disappointed by that, but I was glad to see Wiig in a role that isn't over-the-top.

EXTRACT is a quite little film.  There are some comically absurd moments, but there's also a layer of humor that is much more subtle.  There's a lot of warmth in the movie.  In fact, if one were to extract some of the more outrageous moments of the movie, EXTRACT reminds me of some of the comedies from the late 1930s-1940s.  The character development and much of the humor is subdued.  It's a type of humor that in our in-your-face culture is often lost on the mindless whims of the populace.  In many ways the movie is an emotional sequel to OFFICE SPACE.  In that movie the lead character, Peter Gibbons, eventually quits his job. Though the characters are different, EXTRACT is a look at Peter Gibbons ten years later.  I really enjoyed it.",1288137600,,2830,4.639839034205232

3972799,5,B002RBNNTA,"Any character Jason Bateman plays is immediately going to catch my interest simply because his role from that comedy sitcom Arrested Development has won me over for *life*.

He sort of plays a similar role in Extract (always finding himself in awkward situations and having to search for a funny solution to the problems that develop soon after) and that's exactly what the humor is based upon- his character, and his reactions.

I really like that style of comedy.  Extract benefits by having a bunch of talented actors and actresses nailing their roles perfectly, an elaborate and clever storyline, and a fair amount of humor.

There's a few different storylines darting around while the film is progressing.  The biggest plotline is probably the one involving Jason Bateman's character trying to encourage a young guy that works for him (since Bateman is the boss of his very own company) to sleep with his wife.

You see, Bateman's character is that of someone who desperately wants something *anything* to spice up his relationship with his wife, so he basically hires a young man to sleep with his wife, haha.  The segments leading up to how this happens is a bit elaborate but totally funny.

Unfortunately for Jason Bateman, the young man actually becomes really close with his wife.  A lot of humorous scenes then develop.

The other storyline (occurring simultaneously) is about a young woman (the girl from That 70's Show) who goes around stealing things.  Her character is that of a money hungry thief.  What eventually comes out of this is a potential lawsuit.  I won't spoil what actually happens though.

The final story focuses on Bateman's company potentially going under because the employees are unhappy with their working conditions and the amount of money they're being paid.

Overall, a pretty funny film, but I mostly liked it for the clever storytelling.  It's one of those ""All the pieces fell into place"" kind of comedies that takes a careful attention to detail in order to pull off successfully.  Luckily it works, so the movie is worth watching.",1281225600,,2074,4.9479768786127165

Office Space and Idiocracy are so much fun, and Extract continues that.  Bateman is simply excellent in the lead role, perfect.  Mila has really grown on me, she was ""cute"" for the 70's show, but I'm glad to see her moving up.  One little nitpick I had with this was the ""stoner"" character.  Don't know who played him, but he was too much like a skin head meth dealer, loud, obnoxious, violent, etc.  Didn't seem like your friendly pot dealer dude.

The entire film is lethargic, bordering on catatonic, as if no one really was interested in being there, or as if they were afraid to go the distance on their roles.  The standout exception was Mila Kunis, who went all out and sold her character from the start.  She's the most interesting part of this film.  The actors were proven professionals who have each reached the heights of their profession in other roles - Bateman, Affleck, Wiig, for a start - but in ""Extract,"" it's as if they were sleepwalking.  Even Mike Judge, who brought us the timeless classic ""Office Space"" and the flawed but entertaining ""Idiocracy,"" can't inject any life into these proceedings.  ""Extract"" as a movie is like the company in the movie; Bateman is trapped by, rather than excited by, his own company; the movie has the same attitude about itself.  This should have been a lot more than it was.  Instead, it's an unfunny mess that thankfully is over in only 90 minutes.  Pass, and watch ""Office Space"" or ""Arrested Development"" instead.",1275868800,5,1173,4.71078431372549

STARRING: Jason Bateman, Mila Kunis, Ben Affleck, Kristen Wiig, J.K. Simmons, Clifton Collins Jr., David Koechner, Dustin Milligan, Beth Grant and Gene Simmons

WRITTEN BY: Mike Judge

DIRECTED BY: Mike Judge

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 04 September 2009

Extract may not be the best comedy to a lot of people, but I don't think it could have been any better for me. I loved everything about it. The fact that someone has finally given Jason Bateman a leading role, was more than reason enough to see it.

Bateman plays a less than happy guy named Joel. Joel doesn't live the worst life, especially considering the fact that he owns his own business. But his life is still far from exceptional; especially to him.

For starters, his wife Suzie (Kristen Wig) wants nothing to do with him sexually. This is shown repeated times by instances where he has failed to walk in the door by the deadline; the deadline being the exact same time, every day, that Suzie puts on her sweat pants. Once the pants are on, they aren't coming off! Director Mike Judge adds a humorous close-up or two of her sealing Joel off from her sacred temple, by tying the loops of her sweats tightly.

Other than his long and dreadful days at his Extract Syrup factory that he runs, the main reason he can never seem to walk in the door in time is due to his insanely obnoxious neighbor. God, this guy drove me nuts and reminded me of so many irritating people, as will it no doubt do for you. The always funny David Koechner plays him perfectly and you want to strangle him within 30 seconds of meeting him. He's the guy that cannot take even the boldest hints that scream `I am not interested in what he has to say', and `you need to leave!' Met one or two of him before? I think we all have.

These are just the daily setbacks that Joel faces week in and week out. Things get even worse for him when there is a freak accident at work. One of his employees, Step (Clifton Collins Jr.), was severely injured and now has a potential lawsuit. I won't spoil the mishap with details, but I will tell you it develops from very humorous characters performing their job functions at a less than stellar performance level. Again, I'm sure we can all relate to this as well.

While all of this is going on, we have also met a beautiful woman who knows she's beautiful and uses it to con unsuspecting men. Mila Kunis plays the part of Cindy, very well. When she hears of Step's lawsuit, she comes a-running.

Cindy applies for a job at the plant and is hired. Before we know it, she has set plans in motion to seduce Joel and Step simultaneously. Desperate for the attention his wife fails to show him, he talks to his best friend for support in what he should do.

That best friend just so happens to be played by the legendary Ben Affleck. He had me in stitches in every scene. Affleck plays Dean, a bartender at a sports bar in the side of a hotel. He's kind of a hippie and he's kind of a player and he's totally believable. He has a shaggy beard and long wavy hair, in need of constant brushing from his eyes. Affleck added some really nice qualities to this character and should do more comedy. Upon meeting Cindy while visiting Joel at work, he delivers my favorite line in the film. While staring at her from Joel's office window, Joel tells him she's a temp and Dean turns suddenly with a look of genuine excitement and says, ""She's a tramp?"" It kills, trust me!

Joel confides in his pal Dean in hopes of gaining some helpful relationship advice. The advice that Dean offers him is less than canny and from there the movie spirals out of control and is effortlessly hysterical.

Mike Judge has a true gift for comedy. From his Beavis and Butt-head characters, to his instant classic Office Space, the guy brings us people we can relate to, laugh with and more fun importantly, laugh at. Extract has several of each.",1274140800,5,3906,4.437150837988827

3972806,3,B002RBNNTA,"""Extract"" is written and directed by Mike Judge and follows Joel, played by Jason Bateman who owns and manages an extract company. He deals with issues like assembly line worker stupidity, theft in the workplace, not getting action with his wife and being attracted to a new temp played by Mila Kunis. Joel tries to pay a jigalo (after being drugged by Ben Affleck) to have sex with his wife so he wouldn't feel guilty pursuing the new hot girl. Chaos always ensues.

I've loved Jason Batemen since Arrested Development and he is still the straight guy among idiots and his character is entirely too nice in this movie. I guess that's my big complaint on this one - he's nicer and more forgiving than any normal person, but darn it all I guess that's why we like him.

This movie was really funny and had a lot of ridiculous situations. I couldn't believe I liked Ben Affleck in this movie! He usually drives me nuts but here he was a character so different from the usual and with his appearance....I was able to almost forget it was Ben Affleck and laugh!

Other great additions to the cast, J.K. Simmons, Beth Grant whom I will always love from Donnie Darko, and Kristen Wiig who plays Joel's wife, Suzie. Also David Koechner plays a completely oblivious annoyingly pushy neighbor that you just love to hate. This was a fun ensemble piece and the best cameo of all -- Gene Simmons as a lawyer suing Joel for everything he's worth. If I tried to explain what was funny about this all, it would just give away too many jokes. Give this one a rental, you won't regret it. I bet it grows funnier with multiple viewings.",1269129600,,1618,4.496598639455782
3972807,4,B002RBNNTA,"If people are disappointed with this film because it's not ""Office Space"" they should get over it.  Director Mike Judge's previous effort was a scathing indictment of corporate America where the workers are dispensible and reports have more value than the psychological well being of the employees.  ""Extract"" is a more genial exercise whose laughs are more subtle but not less satisfying.  Judge here seems to be championing family entrepreneurism where the boss has an open door policy and knows the names of his employees.  This film was dumped on the market during the waning days of summer.  It's almost like the studio wanted this film to fail.

3972808,4,B002RBNNTA,"Well, of course it's a Mike Judge movie, so attention must be paid, if he is your cup of tea, directorially speaking. Be warned that this is more of an amiable and character-driven movie than a manic and plot-driven movie, so the humor (well, with the exception of an assembly-line accident with painfully embarrassing results to one character) is fairly low-key. It's more a gentle ramble along a scenically convoluted path, rather than a high-speed chase.

The plot, such as it is, involves Joel (Jason Bateman), the manager/owner of a small but profitable flavor-extract enterprise, on the verge of selling the company on favorable terms, and retiring to a life of leisure and luxury. He is the linchpin; around whom revolve and occasionally frustrate an assortment of characters - including but not limited to - his bored wife (Kristen Wiig), a deadly boring neighbor (David Koechner), a new employee (Mila Kunis) of dubious ethical principles and a taste for dressing down (way, way down!), old employees of varying degrees of ineptitude, and a best friend (Ben Affleck) with a penchant for offering really, really bad advice - like hiring the pool-man to test his wife's virtue. How life unravels - and then ravels again for Joel and the factory is unfolded in a series of quirky and humorous tableaux. It's all very genial, occasionally pointed, and very, very Mike Judge.

Having been occasionally afflicted with a neighbor who always managed to appear at the most inconvenient times, with the most pointless conversation, and being almost oblivious to indications that - look, I wasn't interested and had things to do! I laughed the most at the Joel's neighborhood nemesis - does everyone but the viciously anti-social hermits have one of those?

The extra on this DVD is basically a documentary about the making of - which did have some interested tid-bits; such as being filmed on location in an actual bottling plant.",1269043200,,1929,5.003115264797508
3972809,5,B002RBNNTA,"The problem with debuting with Office Space is that all of Mike Judge's subsequent efforts will end up being compared to it.  The subtle humor, the lovable characters, the absurdity of it all is difficult to pull off even once.  Yet with Extract, Mike Judge seems to have come very close to the original formula while managing to create a whole new set of characters, situations, and a plot that keeps the viewer interested.  Yes, this is another work-related movie, but now the boss is a good guy, and it's really about him.  Two separate story lines are reminiscent of that old adage about keeping work and personal life separate.  When they intersect, all hell and hilarity break loose.  Jason Bateman and JK Simmons do a wonderful job, and Ben Affleck is barely recognizable with the handlebar mustache and a proletarian affect.",1268352000,,832,4.823943661971831

3972815,1,B002RBNNTA,"I couldn't finish this movie.

Like the annoying neighbor who traps the main character in his driveway over and over again, I went into each scene wondering if anything was going to make me laugh.

Jason Bateman's character is nearly vacant enough for Paul Rudd to play.  He owns a company and he doesn't get much from his wife...basically, he's a normal schmuck who isn't all that interesting.  He employs bickering employees who aren't that interesting either.  You would not want to hang with any of these people during or after work.  Milas Kunis is a smokin' hot chick but she's such a despicable person, stealing and scamming from everyone in her path, that I hated her.  So what that she's hot?  Was her hotness supposed to offset what a terrible person she really is?

Ben Affleck plays a shaggy, stupid bartender who somehow tends bar in a Marriott or some upscale place--obviously a place that would never hire an unkempt moron like him.

There's a workplace plot that involves a character getting his privates mutilated and the impending lawsuit that could upset the sale of the company.  Then there's a domestic plotline of a husband setting his wife up for adultery that has absolutely nothing to do with the workplace plotline...and none of this would matter if the film was remotely funny.

You'll see a lot of good reviews here but look for the key words, like ""understated.""  That means that the movie is ""not funny.""  ""Subtle.""  ""Not funny.""

3972819,3,B002RBNNTA,"I might have been too harsh in the subject heading seeing I gave it 3 stars, however, I feel that the film lacked the laughs that the trailer suggested. I really like Jason Bateman and he pulled off his role as well as one could possibly imagine, and quite honestly, so did the rest of the cast. In fact, the actors and actresses all did their job perfectly in this film, the problem lies in the script.

The story is of a young man Joel (Bateman) who owns a factory that makes extract, be it vanilla, root beer or the new concoction: cookie dough. In comes the temp agent Cindy (Mila Kunis) who is interested in conning her way to meet with an employer who out seeking a 1 million dollar settlement from the extract company. Meanwhile, Joel is having marital problems with his wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig) who is not offering sex leaving Joel frustrated.

Now these are the set up stories, all of which lead to very little or interesting situations. Joel's friend Dean (Ben Affleck) offers many suggestions, most of which are drug related and do little to provoke a reasonable solution or even funny moments. In fact, Joel comes off as naive by taking his suggestions in the first place. The worst situation Joel finds himself is when he hires a young guy to play a pool man to seduce his wife to test her fidelity, but even that went sour and gave no insight into the dilemma.

The problem of the film seemed to lie in the fact that the characters were not developed enough, and the issues between the extract company and Joel's married life are two plots that co-exist, but never merge or cross paths. Cindy's conning scheme is only tangential to the extract company.

But one thing is sure, EXTRACT is still one of the best all-around movies I've seen this year. JASON BATEMAN is one of the funniest actors around these days. His subtle nuances are what makes him so funny. From TEEN WOLF TOO & HOGAN FAMILY to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT & JUNO, he is a brilliant actor that gets laughs without ever changing his restrained sense of humor.

The movie itself is about a young, moderately successful factory owner. The factory produces, of course,food extract. The story unfolds and plans backfire, thanks mostly impart to his best friend played by BEN AFFLECK. The role for AFFLECK is a nice return for him back to his roots of doing less than award-winning blockbuster films. With KRISTEN WIIG in a somewhat toned down role and MILA KUNIS as a bit of a vixen, the supporting cast is really well-rounded.

""Extract"" focuses on Joel (played by Jason Bateman, ""Arrested Development"", ""Hancock"", ""Juno""), a man who owns his own company ""Reynold's Extract"" that specializes in flavor-extract.

Joel puts long hours into his work in hopes that one day a major company will purchase his business, a dream that his manager Brian (played by J.K. Simmons, ""Spider-Man"" films, ""Juno"") hopes will happen.  Having to deal with the amiable employees day in and day out, Joel feels that his main way of getting out his frustrations is through sex with his wife Suzie (played by Kristen Wiig, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Adventureland"") and that he needs to get home to his place before 8:00 p.m. before his wife puts on her sweats.  Otherwise, he doesn't get any.  As for Suzie, she yearns for their earlier years when life was much more simple for them and they had more time with each other.  Since Joel is working all the time, you get a sense that Suzie is quite lonely at home.

Meanwhile each time he tries to go home, Joel encounters his meddling and annoying neighbor Nathan (played by David Koechner, ""Hank"", ""American Dad!"") who tries to get Joel and his wife to go to a club dinner with them.

But at the extract factory, Joel's employees are having a problem with people not pulling their own weight at the job and things start to go downhill when the workers briefly stop working and chaos takes place.  One of the factory's hardworking employees Step (played by Clifton Collins Jr., ""Star Trek"", ""Crank: High Voltage"") gets into an accident and for Joel and Brian, they know that a lawsuit by Step can hurt the company's chances from being purchased.

With all these problems in his life, Joel confides his problems to his friend/bartender Dean (played by Ben Affleck, ""Armageddon"", ""Chasing Amy"", ""Daredevil"") who comes up with the wildest (and morally wrong) ideas to help his friend.

Meanwhile, with Step's accident making it on the front page news, a kleptomaniac, habitual liar and opportunist named Cindy (played by Mila Kunis, ""That 70's Show"", ""Family Guy"") gets a job at the extract factory and is up to no good.

Needless to say, Joel's life changes when he meets Cindy.  But will the change be for the positive or the negative?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Extract"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Picture quality has a fine layer of grain and colors vary from vibrant during the outdoor scenes, an emphasis on reds during the bar scenes and natural light or blues used in the factory.  Skin tones are natural and for the most part, picture quality is satisfactory for this film.

Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit) and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For the most part, ""Extract"" is a dialogue driven film with most of the audio being front and center channel driven.  There is  music that utilizes the bass in the film but ""Extract"" is one of those films not to expect too much in terms of uses of lossless audio.  The soundtrack is appropriate for this film, being front and center channel and driven but you do hear the music utilized within the surround channels but that's pretty much it.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Extract"" comes with the following special features featured in 1080p or 480i, English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital and with English SDH, French or Spanish subtitles.  Included are:

  * Deleted Scene--(:37) Straight from the factory floor, watch this exclusive deleted scene (Blu-ray only) where Dean explains his rather abrupt departure from Willie's party the night before and finds out Joel got punched in the face.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Many people including myself wondered if Mike Judge could pull of another sleeper hit with ""Extract"" as he did a decade ago with ""Office Space"".  Although, ""Office Space"" was not a box office winner, on DVD it quickly gained a cult following.

Although, ""Extract"" is an enjoyable dark comedy, it doesn't quite reach ""Office Space"" status but it sure does make for one entertaining 92-minutes.

Part of my enjoyment of the film is its unapologetic characters.  Jason Bateman does an incredible job as the role of Joel.  Deadpan humor, Joel seems like your average Joe, despite owning his own extract company.  But it's the common repetitiveness in his life that his only satisfaction is by making sure he gets home in time before his designer wife puts on her sweatpants.

Joel's wife (played by ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Kristen Wiig) is your wife almost has a similar situation where she wants more from her marriage and have a closer relationship as they had when they were younger but the tradeoff for Joel's success and a good living is her husband's commitment to his business.  So, needless to say, the pressure of maintaining a large factory of workers takes up most of Joel's time and thus leaving his wife home alone quite a bit.

But it's the other characters that give ""Extract"" such a nice spin.  From the fed up factory workers who are not sure if Joel will sell the company; the stoner/bartender named Dean (played by Ben Affleck) who Joel goes to, when he needs to air his problems; Brian (played by J.K. Simmons), the second in command who tries to urge Joel to sell the company; the nosy and annoying neighbor Nathan (played by David Koechner);  the kleptomaniac and habitual liar Cindy (played by Mila Kunis); Brad the gigolo (played by Dustin Milligan, ""90210') hired to seduce Joel's wife and the greedy attorney Joe Adler (played by KISS rocker Gene Simmons) .

Probably one of the funniest characters in the film is T.J. Miller (""Carpoolers"", ""Cloverfield"") who plays the character of the musician Rory who goes up to everyone he works with and ask them to show up at his band's gig.  His demeanor is quite hilarious and it's good to see his character utilized quite a bit during the factory sequences of the film.

Each of these characters play a unique part in the film and for the most part, some of these characters are unapologetic, often misinformed and even greedy. But for the most part, Mike Judge really executed these characters quite well in the film.

If there was one thing about ""Extract"" which I felt was not as strong as his previous hit film ""Office Space"", where there were characters that you do like and enjoy, ""Extract"" tends to have characters that you just don't feel any good or bad towards them.

These are characters are dysfunctional in many ways and for the main character, you wonder how far down Joel will drive himself down to his poor decision making.  Needless to say, it all comes down to one's sense of humor.

As for the Blu-ray release, I have to admit that I was surprised that there were only three special features.  I was expecting a commentary track, a gag reel, improve scenes or something more than what was included.  But overall, PQ is well-done and the lossless soundtrack was appropriate for the film.

There is no doubt that Mike Judge has a great take on comedy and he knows how to utilize humor in various settings (as he did in his animated series ""King of the Hill"" and even ""Beavis & Butthead"") and once again he is able to accomplish a film that is hilarious, smart and outright witty.

As mentioned, it all comes down to your sense of humor.  If you enjoyed Mike Judge's works, especially ""Office Space"", definitely give ""Extract"" a chance!",1261440000,2,8076,4.800289435600579
3972827,5,B002RBNNTA,"Writer/Director Mike Judge seems to have a clear understanding about the things that comprise part of our daily lives, which are at times irritating, and somehow we simply can't avoid. He provided evidence of this in his Beavis and Butthead films and TV episodes, and most especially in the hilarious ""Office Space,"" in which he reminded us about the silly things that we have to endure at our jobs. ""Extract"" successfully follows this trend, with Judge exploring more common situations that take place at work, this time mixing great humor with a dose of humanity.

The movie mostly takes place in an extract manufacturing business, where Joel (Jason Bateman) is the owner and boss. He successfully built it from scratch, thanks to his degree in chemistry and some family traditions, which inspired him to develop a variety of extracts or flavors to enrich our foods. He is a modest, decent man, with an enormous amount of patience, taking into account that he has some very dysfunctional employees.  However, all of the sudden, troubles begin piling up in his life, which mostly have to do when Joel mistakenly hires of a pretty criminal drifter (Mita Kunis), who only joins the factory in order to convince Step (Clifton Collins Jr.), a recently injured employee, to sue Joel. At the same time, she romances Step, in order that she can get the lawsuit settlement money. Meanwhile, Joel can't stand his wife (Kristen Wiig) anymore, and follows the ill-advice of his bartender best friend (Ben Affleck) to hire a gigolo to seduce his wife, so that he can prove that she is unfaithful to him, and get grounds for a divorce. Furthermore, the employees at the factory are planning to strike because they think that Joel is going to sell the business. Ah, and there is this older lady in the factory that blames all the problems at the jobsite - including stealing - to this particular Mexican employee. Confusing enough, ah? Imagine all the decisions that Joel has to make!

""Extract"" is funny and sincere, with the heart at the right place -- a little piece of our life. I'm sure that you have met some of its characters. Gene Simmons (yes, the very same from Kiss) steals his scenes as Joe Adler, the lawyer that files the suit against Joel. The DVD also features a making-of documentary.

3972828,3,B002RBNNTA,"I really didn't know what to expect when I saw this! There were a few funny parts, but nothing where you laugh out loud at. Joel Reynolds owns an extract company and falls in love with a beautiful con-artist named Cindy. While he is high, he tries to get a gigolo to sleep with his wife while he can have an affair with Cindy, but the plan backfires. I probably wouldn't recommend EXTRACT!!!",1257638400,5,391,4.36986301369863
3972829,4,B002RBNNTA,"""Extract, directed by Mike Judge (King of the Hill), is about Joel (Jason Bateman) who runs an extract factory. He has his regular ups and downs just like anyone, but when one of his workers loses his testicle in a freak accident things start to go from bad to worse. (Spoiler alert for those who have yet to see the film) The next thing that happens to him is a con-woman named Cindy (Mila Kunis) begins work for him. Cindy convinces the testicleless employee to file a lawsuit against the company. Also, his wife hasn't wanted to have sex with him for months, and he takes some bad advice from his friend, Dean (Ben Affleck), and hires a pool guy to seduce his wife so that he can guiltlessly have an affair with Cindy, and before he knows it the pool guy is coming over everyday and has fallen in love with his wife. Then the employees decide that they should get a piece of the pie of his company, since he is thinking of selling it to a prospective buyer, and decide to go on strike.

""Extract"" is like one of those bad months where one thing after another keeps happening to Joel. Joel is a nice guy, who has always tried to be good to people and do the right thing. He knows all of his employees names. He can't even bring himself to yell at the pool guy for continuing to visit his wife at his house. ""Extract"" is a pleasant little film that just keeps moving along with one amusing ill event after another. We wonder where this is all leading, because it looks like fate is against Joel. He is about to lose everything, his wife, his business, et cetera. But then there's a turning point where he realizes that Cindy is probably not as innocent as she seems. And as gently as misfortune had swelled over him, it then begins to subside, and all begins to fall back into place as before. This film washes gently over one as mildly and pleasantly as does Joel's kindly demeanor.",1256169600,16,1884,4.337110481586402
3972830,3,B002RBNNTA,"Joel (Jason Bateman) is the owner of a successful flavor extract company. But his plans to sell the company are threatened following a testicle injury to an employee named Step (Clifton Collins). Step is at first willing to settle until being manipulated by an attractive con artist (Mila Kinus).There is also a sub-plot involving Joel's sexual frustration, his bored wife (Kristen Wiig) and a not so bright ""gigolo"".

I've been a fan of writer/director Mike Judge since his ""Beavis And Butthead"" days. So I had high expectations for this movie. It does feature Judge's knack for observation on the lives of everday people, especially the not so bright. But somehow the plot just never comes together in a way that I found compelling. Also the laughs are only occassional rather than frequent. I still appreciate Judge's insightfully satirical take on American life. But he's got to deliver the laughs in a bigger way if he is going to make it work.",1252713600,2,949,4.894409937888199
3972831,4,B002RBNNTA,"From the mind of Mike Judge (""Office Space"") comes ""Extract,"" a movie about the mundane daily struggles of Joel Reynolds (Jason Bateman). Joel is the owner of a flavoring extract plant where he is forced to babysit his mismatched and unmotivated employees and dreams of the day he can sell the company off and stop working altogether. His wife, Suzie (SNL's Kristen Wiig) sits at home, depressed and lonely, while Joel struggles to make it home before the eight o'clock deadline when she puts on her sweatpants and all hopes of coitus are squashed. A con-woman (Mila Kunis) comes into the picture, hoping to capitalize on a pending lawsuit against the company as well as catching Joel's eye. Not knowing what to do, he turns to his drug-peddling bartender friend (Ben Affleck) who in turn suggests he hires a gigolo to have an affair with his wife so he can go forward with his own affair, guilt-free.

If it sounds ludicrous and over-the-top, it is. Mike Judge's films always have a way of spinning everyday-life situations in the wildest ways. What starts out with the best (well, sort of) intentions quickly spirals downward into a mess beyond repair. Like ""Office Space,"" ""Extract"" is Judge's version of what happens when the everyday, working-class man gets bored and decides to do something about it. Is it meant to be a cautionary tale or simply a social commentary? Whatever the answer, it works on both levels. You'll laugh at Joel's misfortunes while a little part of you feels sympathy knowing deep down that he is simply a nice guy gone wrong and that things like this (although not as extreme) could happen to any one of us. That sort of twisted reality is what makes a good Mike Judge film, and no doubt, this is another of his that is destined to become a cult-classic.

Thankfully, though, the movie isn't so wacky that it loses its humanity. Despite some odd performances in the film, achieved brilliantly by Affleck, David Koechner and J.K. Simmons (who, with his bald-head, somewhat resembles a character in one of Mike Judge's cartoons) and the outrageous events that unfold, the film still keeps its heart firmly in place. Granted, you won't laugh as thoroughly as you might during other comedies, but during Judge's fourth feature-length film, you'll squirm enough in your seat during the awkward moments to know that you were delivered a solid story with real characters and humor derived from their pain and suffering. ""Extract"" is, at the end of the day, an intelligent, hard-working and quirky little comedy that will no doubt find its audience in the years to come, much like ""Office Space."" Unfortunately the film isn't doing so hot right now (debuting at #10!), so I urge you to go to the movies and give it a shot. I promise, you won't be sorry.",1252627200,2,2775,4.779166666666667
3972832,3,B002RBNNTA,"""Extract,"" has one of those plots that seem more plausible when you're sitting in an air-conditioned theater, rather than describing it afterwards.  Bateman plays Joel, the owner of an extract factory, who is experiencing difficulties both at work and in his marriage.  His wife won't have sex with him, if he gets home at a certain hour, which is often, as he gets waylaid by his overly friendly neighbor before he's even out of the car.  At the factory, he must deal with employees that are not rocket scientists (to put it generously), a potential lawsuit, and a gorgeous young temp (Kunis) who is planning a scam.  His bartender friend (Ben Affleck) gives him advice, but following only tends to worsen things.

""Extract,"" has a great cast including Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Mila Kunis, Ben Affleck, Gene Simmons (as a personal injury lawyer), and the blond surfer guy from the new Beverly Hills
90210.  Some parts were hilarious, but others very dull; though because it was from the creator of ""Office Space,"" I wanted to like it more than I did.",1252368000,,1055,4.801104972375691
3972833,3,B002RBNNTA,"I've been waiting or this movie.  Loved Office Space, even really enjoyed Idiocracy.  I heard some mixed reviews which tempered my expectations, but even so, this was a disappointing and very uneven movie.

Jason Bateman plays his straight-laced, deadpan comedy to the hilt, much as he did in Arrested Development.  He is Joel, the owner of a factory employing a real assortment of underachieving, funny characters.  With an offer from General Mills to buy the plant and make him rich, Joel looks forward to early retirement.  On the home front, he is a sexually frustrated husband with an unreceptive wife and an unrelentingly dull neighbor.

With moments of genius, the movie was also dragged down by some poor realization of comedic potential.  Kristin Wiig, a funny and versatile comedienne, is wasted as the housewife, and although she certainly has enough scenes, the writing doesn't allow her to perform.

The various subplots didn't mesh as well as I expected.  Instead of a complete tale, this felt like a few sitcom episodes woven together.

That said, there are some great scenes.  You will never think about call-waiting again.  The personal injury lawyer is fantastic.  Ben Affleck does a fine job as the slacker friend.

In retrospect, this is a rental.  I wouldn't choose to pay theater prices for this film.",1252281600,27,1323,5.0
