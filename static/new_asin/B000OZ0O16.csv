8187878,1,B000OZ0O16,"This is a 12 minute film, a segment of a ""60 Minutes"" t.v. show. You can't really learn much, if anything, from a twelve minute presentation. There are some other films on global warming that cost no more or even less than this one and which are are much better. From the title ""60 Minutes--The Age of Warming"" I thought it would be an hour long. I did not read the additional data that said the running time is 12 minutes. So, I'm stuck with a $17.95 item that is useless for my purposes.

I contacted Amazon customer service and they authorized a complete refund. And they did it within a half hour of my initial contact. That is great service!!",1309564800,,647,4.347107438016529
