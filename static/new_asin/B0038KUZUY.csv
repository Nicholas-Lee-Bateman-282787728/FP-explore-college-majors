8749972,4,B0038KUZUY,"A low budget originally made for TV movie back in 2008 where a mother takes helicopter parenting to the extreme, continuing her abuse when her daughter is in I guess her late 30's or something.  She rings her when she's driving home and is a minute late and guilts her into not going out after work or pretty much having a life outside of the house. If the daughter attempts to do anything other than come straight home, mummy or blinky the dog will have an accident that only Lily can deal with. Maternal Obsession follows the formula of made for TV movies by using an actor from a once high rating show that has long been off the air. The daughter is played by Nicholle Tom who your most likely to recognise from her younger days playing teen characters on shows in the 90s like The Nanny.  Gwynyth Walsh plays the evil mother, she does a pretty good job, you certainly despise her as you're supposed to do, can't say I recognise her from any other movies/TV shows though.

Cameron Daddo plays a recently moved to Philadelphia work colleague who likes what he sees at the photocopier who the paranoid mind of the mother will see as a threat to her little girl moving out and leaving her all alone.  He does an all right job but the script for him is a bit weak in the believability factor and he is completely calm no matter the situation.  Likewise Lily, your constantly yelling at the screen, why would you put up with that? It also has a terrible lackluster ending for a movie, especially a thriller. But even with its faults, Maternal Obsession is still an interesting and watchable low budget thriller.  If you come across it for a couple of dollars or see it on TV or something, it's worth checking out.",1476921600,,1711,4.43312101910828
