8360814,5,B002B8KU36,"I was looking for a gift for my 3.5 yr old grandniece who lives in Orlando, Florida. I wanted to give her something that was educational and that helped her learn more Spanish (she does not have many opportunities to practice her native language in Orlando). During one of my visits, she happened to show me one of her favorite shows (it airs on Nick JR) and, as an educator, I loved it too. Pocoyo is a wonderful children's educational series produced in Spain (is dubbed in English in the US), so I figured that it would be relatively easy to obtain the Pocoyo programs on DVD with the original Spanish tracks.
Well...it was actually not easy. This is the only vendor on Amazon that does carry Pocoyo DVDs in Spanish and that are playable in US DVD players (Region 1). So I was happy to obtain them, but they are slightly overpriced (the English-dubbed Pocoyo DVD's run for much less here in Amazon). I am happy to pay the slight price difference because now my grand-niece can watch one of her favorite programs in Spanish (she has Pocoyo toys, too...courtesy of her grand-uncle!) :)
This is a wonderful series designed for pre-schoolers. They learn colors, shapes, and tons of vocabulary. The episodes (they run about 8 minutes each) also teach general values and mores. They are very well produced (computer animation in primary colors with a white background)and are extremely fun, lively and engaging for pre-schoolers. If you are looking for fun, educational programming that will help your child learn Spanish, I recommend this series (I am a second language educator).",1329350400,5,1578,4.805147058823529
