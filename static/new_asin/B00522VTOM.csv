It makes me grateful that I'm still here to enjoy the life that so many people that I knew and met died for during that great and terrible  war. This is the story of the Texas Division, United States Infantry. They  are coming in thru hell and high water; Freedman and Pine,Revera and  Porter, a Texan from Jersey, and one from Dekota, a Texan from out near  Deluth, Minnesota;Kansas, Main and Tennesee, Lord God, Their all in the  Texas Infantry!

4526696,3,B00522VTOM,"This is a decent story about an infantry platoon in World War II set in Italy.  It is stylistically dated.  There is a LOT of conversation scenes that might grow tiresome.  The movie appealed to me primarily from the standpoint of Hollywood History.  I enjoy watching the evolution of actors' careers.  Richard Conte, Dana Andrews, Lloyd Bridges, and John Ireland are just some of the actors who played important roles in this movie.

The movie was made toward the end of World War II.  There is no doubt this caused the movie makers to make compromises.  One such compromise that stuck out to me was P 51 Mustangs being portrayed as German aircraft.  Other American equipment was depicted as German equipment.

The above is understandable to me but the movie is also somewhat slow moving by modern standards.  Ironically it may accurately depict the pace of a day n the infantry.  But the movie does seem to proceed slowly.  I am glad I viewed this movie, but do not need to see it again soon.  Thank You...",1489276800,,1008,4.621468926553672

4526705,4,B00522VTOM,"Here's an unjustly neglected WWII film that feels honest & unglamorous in every frame, telling the story of the war from the perspective of a small squad of men assigned to capture a farmhouse 6 miles in from the beach at Salerno. The first thing that struck me was the absence of any spectacular action scenes, and just how much ISN'T shown -- what we see is what the soldiers see from their isolated viewpoint, with lengths of anxious boredom punctuated by shockingly swift moments of combat. The emphasis is on the psychological toll of war on a day-to-day, hour-to-hour basis -- these are ordinary men required to do a soul-killing but necessary job -- they're anything but the impossibly over-muscled super-soldiers we see in so many films today. Their outlook is laconic, shot through with protective dark humor, depicted through weary understatement ... and yet this brings out their basic humanity & decency all the more as the story progresses.

For example, when the squad leader finally breaks down due to the burden of responsibility, the rest of the squad demonstrates a muted understanding -- they know the pressures he was under, they know it could just as easily have been any one of them. Star Dana Andrews must take command then, and it isn't long before he starts feeling the same awful weight himself. The film honors the soldiers by never being overly heroic. The real heroism is bearing up under the constant strain, the ever-present dread of both being killed & seeing the people you're closest to in the world killed -- all in an unexpected instant.

The VCI disc seems to be the best available at present, complete with some informative extras. My only complaint would be the varying sound quality, which may be due to the source material; I had to turn up the volume as high as possible to catch some of the dialogue. But this is just a minor drawback. The film itself is intensely powerful, really bringing home the demands of war & the struggle to retain your humanity in the midst of it. Director Lewis Milestone uses stark, vivid images to focus emotion into sharp, memorable points -- the recurring hand that fills the frame, sometimes living & sometimes dead; the relentless, down-to-the-bone exhaustion in every face. It's not your typical war film, and it's all the better because of that fact. Highly recommended!",1441324800,4,2348,4.823821339950372

4526711,4,B00522VTOM,"Based on a 1944 book by Harold Brown, A WALK IN THE SUN was released in 1946, after the war ended.  It describes the struggles of the Lee Platoon of the Texas Division, which lands in Italy near Salerno, with orders to travel six miles to take a farmhouse in the countryside.  Although the division gets off to a rough start when their commanding officer is seriously wounded during the landing, they are soon dug in on the beach, where they await further orders.  But it soon transpires there will be no further orders.  Left to their own devices with a new commander who shows signs of strain, they must struggle on to complete their mission on their own.

When it comes to war films, A WALK IN THE SUN is often included on lists of the best.  Even so, and in spite of a famous director and notable cast, it remains an somewhat obscure film.  Some of this may be because there are few battle scenes in the movie, which presents the characters as forced to wait, trudge, wait, and trudge some more in grinding boredom punctuated only by unexpected attacks over which they have little, if any, control.  Throughout the film the characters express exhaustion and frustration, wanting something to happen but also afraid of what might happen.  Throughout the film the men tell each other nobody dies as a sort of talisman against the inevitable.

The cast is extremely good.  Dana Andrews gives one of his more memorable performances as Sgt. Bill Tyne, and he is well supported by the likes of Hurbert Rudley, Sterling Holloway, Lloyd Bridges, Richard Conte, and John Ireland.  Robert Rossens screenplay is clean and clipped, and Russell Harlans cinematography follows suit, keying off the soundtrack by Freddie Eferm Rich, Millard Lampell, and Earl Robinson.  Director Louis Milestone, who so memorably directed the 1930 ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, creates a powerful sense of gradually building unease and paranoia as the film progresses.  Although a few savaged itmost infamously director Samuel Fullerthe film received extremely good reviews in its original release.

A WALK IN THE SUN had a rather complicated production history and was ultimately filmed as an independent production that was eventually acquired by 20th Century Fox, and this may account for the very poor VHS and DVD releases it has received.  Fortunately, the VCI releasewhile hardly pristineis very good, and it includes a number of bonuses, most particularly on the cast.  Not, perhaps, as good as its reputation suggests, but a very unusual film that is more than worth watching.  Recommended.

4526715,4,B00522VTOM,"While A WALK IN THE SUN is obviously a propaganda piece designed to extol the virtues of the US Army, it nonetheless offers a highly convincing portrait of a platoon at war.  Led by Sgt. Bill Tyne (Dana Amdtrews), they manage to blow up a bridge, destroy an armored car and capture a farmhouse in occupied Italy in 1943.  There are an array of good supporting performances, notably from Lloyd Bridges as a no-nonsense farmer perpetually dreaming of an apple, Richard Conte as Private River, perpetually cadging a butt (cigarette) from one of his fellow-soldiers, and Norman Lloyd as a skillful navigator of difficult terrain suffering from advanced sleep deprivation.  Lewis Milestone's film does not shy away from portraying the seamier side of war: Sgt. Eddie Porter (Herbert Rudley) fights one battle too many and eventually collapses to the ground in nervous exhaustion.  Other platoon members perish in their attempts to capture the targets.  Russell Harlan's photography is little short of brilliant as he tracks the platoon moving through woodland or crawling on their stomachs in order to reach the farmhouse.  There are some clever editing devices, notably the zoom into a map spread out in front the troops, followed by a zoom out to begin a new scene; or the deliberately blurred point of view shot from Andrews' perspective as he looks at the farmhouse to be captured, while trying to stave off his exhaustion.  Sometimes director Milestone uses the telling close-up to make his point about the effects of war; a dead hand hanging limply over a wall, a human face staring impassively at the camera; the face of one of the troops filling the screen.  The music - by Fredric Efren Rich - comprises a series of calypsos, not only rooting the film in popular culture, but communicating a message about the importance of freedom.  Definitely a high-profile film - as denoted by the use of the book that opens and closes the film, suggesting that this film aspires to quasi-literary status.",1406246400,,1996,4.934328358208956

4526717,5,B00522VTOM,"A Walk in the Sun, 1945 film

This film is adapted from the book by Harry Brown about the experiences of infantrymen. The US Armed Forces provided support for this film. Soldiers are on a landing barge preparing to invade Italy in 1943. The lieutenant looked over the top when a shell burst and wounded him. The sergeant is now in command. The conversations tell about each soldier. They are being sent six miles inland to capture a farmhouse. The men grumble and complain when waiting. The sun comes up and they are still waiting. They move into the trees to hide from enemy airplanes. The smoke and explosions signify the action in the background. An airplane strafes the woods and hits some of the men. The men chatter about things to avoid discussing their condition.

Sergeant Porter has a problem and cant go on. An enemy armored car comes down the road. They will use grenades to attack it when it returns. The bazookas are used for tanks. The grenades break the tread of the armored car and disable it. They continue walking towards that farmhouse. They assemble behind the stone wall. The machine gun in the farmhouse fires a burst. Windy says they should circle around by the wall and blow-up the bridge and ignore the farmhouse [the indirect approach]. They synchronize their attack on the farmhouse. They charge against the machine guns and take the farmhouse. It was so easy.

This bowdlerized version may be as realistic as Hollywood could be for a war movie. Very little happens until there is much action. [A walk in the sun was a phrase for an easy job.] The film follows the book, except the plane that strafes the woods looks like a P-51, not the ME-110 (or P-38?).",1397001600,,1684,4.625418060200669

He was a foot soldier in World War II, who landed at Normandy and fought his way through France and into Germany.  He was wounded three times and was awarded the Purple Heart and Good Conduct medals.  He has been gone for 47 years and is dearly remembered.  When we watched the film on TV together, he said that it was one of the better portrayals of an infantryman's life in the War.  I was glad to see that it was available on DVD.  I have watched it two times already, and it brings back memories of my father.

Director Lewis Milestone took Harry Brown's book and  made it into the memorable movie it became.

4526723,3,B00522VTOM,"I found this film (in VHS mode) at my local thrift store and felt excited.  I'd long wanted to see it and it was my husband's favorite film, bar none. Was delighted to see that Lewis Milestone both directed and produced, so prepared myself for an enjoyable viewing experience.
But disappointment came stealing in almost immediately with some very odd, out-of-place and intrusive music, sung by a bluesy balladeer, that I did not like. At intervals thereafter, whenever it seems like a lull has developed, making a suitable spot for him to start up again, he does. This singing, though some may call it poetic or soulful, JARS me! Atmospheric/haunting music on the tense/sparse side would have seemed more in keeping.
The banter between Conte's character and his sidekick could have been better written, even if the object was realism, because it quickly gets tiresome (and at the end, seriously annoying) plus there's too much of it. Sterling Holloway's and Dana Andrews' characters are quite good, ditto John Ireland's, and Archimbauld the scout is really first rate. Some of the sequences, particularly when there is action, are quite engrossing. But overall, the film is a distinct letdown for me, who prefers the likes of ""Twelve O'Clock High"", ""Grande Illusion"", ""All Quiet.."" and even the relatively low budget ""Sahara"" starring Humphrey Bogart.
(I hope my husband never reads this review. Right now we're just separated but if he ever sees this, he'll divorce me for sure. And probably use this review as grounds!)",1351209600,,1521,5.035714285714286
4526724,5,B00522VTOM,"My friend who owns a sound studio in California restored A Walk In The Sun from 16 m.m. film frame by frame as a hobby.

War is boring and the last fifteen minutes of a battle is exciting if you like being in a war.

4526725,5,B00522VTOM,"A WALK IN THE SUN is an extraordinary focus on the ordinary infantryman.

I use the term ordinary to emphasize just how extraordinary the US infantryman was in WWII. In motion pictures it seems that most war films focus and glorify trained teams sent on secret missions or small groups of elite fighting men trained for a specific purpose. Most of these films never really focus on the men, the morality and camaraderie developed (one exception being THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE) and the day-to-day grind of combat and unsettled nerves. A WALK IN THE SUN is one of a handful of war films that focuses on these endearing elements of civilian men thrown into this mundane (on the surface) yet extraordinary routine of constant exposure to death from enemy ordnance. They are a unit from mixed backgrounds thrown into this maelstrom of uncertainty and death. They develop camaraderie and build trust in each other and execute the daily task they are ordered to without real knowledge of the bigger picture and without specific question of purpose. They get the job done ay any cost whatever the reason. Men die, they grieve and they keep moving. They are on the lowest rung in the field of getting the job done. And they persevere. Recent pictures like SAVING PRIVATE and the restored Sam Fuller epic THE BIG RED ONE have redirected the focus to the lowly ordinary infantryman out there getting the job done.

A WALK IN THE SUN is poetic in nature. Mild mannered Sterling Holloway's death scene is very poignant and difficult to watch and even fathom because of the irony that war has exposed these men to. The diversity of the men is great yet the leader types pick up and take charge when it becomes necessary without any hesitation. Dana Andrews is a man seeing that they get the job done. John Ireland, in one of his better performances, is a distant and cool character that seems like the eyes and ears of the viewer taking in all that transpires.

GO FOR BROKE! This is a very entertaining film directed by Robert Pirosh about the formation of the WWII 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Based on factual events and what makes it unique is that the 442 was made up of Japanese-American volunteers who served in the European, essentially Italy and France, theater of battle. Van Johnson, giving one of his best performances, portrays Lt. Mike Grayson in charge of a platoon of these troops. Van Johnson as Lt. Grayson carries as much prejudice against Japanese-Americans as did the rest of the country at that point in the war. The film appears true to its subject depicting prejudice and resentment from both sides of the issue. The combat scenes have a sense of reality about them never losing sight of the horrors of war. The photography by Paul C. Vogel and detailed sets by Cedric Gibbons and Eddie Imazu enhance this point. However, this film does run the gamut of emotions and the camaraderie of the Japanese-American soldiers developed along side Van Johnson's Lt. Grayson is extremely well conveyed and is a high point of this film. This is a very good film, somehow forgotten and deserves to be seen and stand along side other essential WWII films.",1337385600,3,3295,4.809523809523809

Special footnote, The novel by Harry Brown, from which the film was made, was republished a few years ago and the dialog in the film is lifted straight out of it, which is part of what makes the film so great. In fact, this is one of those rare cases where the movie follows the book faithfully, almost to the letter --- The characters are all strong and what they talk about while in the middle of a war is partly what pulls you in --- Thanks to VCI we can now enjoy this first time restored & un-cut edition on video.

Total Time: 117 min on DVD ~ VCI Entertainment KPF #606 ~ (11/24/2009)",1264291200,5,2994,4.619961612284069
4526732,5,B00522VTOM,"Adapted from  Harry Brown's novel by Robert Rossen and directed by Lewis Milestone, this 1945 release is one of the finest films ever made about World War II.

Dana Andrews stars as a sergeant in charge of a group of American infantrymen who land on the beach at Salerno, then trek across the countryside to a Nazi-occupied farmhouse that they've been ordered to destroy.

The writing in this picture is almost poetic as we explore the minds of each of the men who only want to come through this relatively minor battle alive.

The stellar cast includes Richard Conte, John Ireland, Lloyd Bridges, Sterling Holloway and Norman Lloyd, who has been interviewed for this DVD that contains a restored, un-cut version of the movie.

Joel Blumberg also contributes an interview, ""The Men of A WALK IN THE SUN""

4526733,1,B00522VTOM,"This review refers to the ""restored"" version released in November. Don't get me wrong, this is a 5 star movie. Unfortunately after returning my first defective DVD, the second DVD disk arrived with similar problems. After the introductory screens (FBI warnings, copyright etc) the disk skips several chapters which I surmise contains  the menu, and begins playing the movie with english subtitles.  You can not stop the subtitles because you can not access the defective disk menu.  I have two DVD players, same problem on both.  Bottom line this DVD is going back, I'll have to wait for a non defective version of this ""restored"" classic.",1262217600,6,639,5.0
4526734,4,B00522VTOM,"Just for clarification, this review applies to the 2009 Kit Parker remastered version.

For those of us waiting decades for a version of A Walk in the Sun with decent picture quality, our prayers have been answered...mostly. It's not quite as clear as what the 1991 Lumivision Laser disc offered but I admit I am being very nit picky here. But, visually, the LD was incredible and this one is very very close to it. Bottom line? I am still very satisfied with the new remaster.

In scene section 7, about half way through, I found there was some pixel and sound distortion for a few seconds. That really irked me. I viewed this section twice and it was worse the first time through than the second. I have a pretty good DVD player and have never had problems with it.

SOUND QUALITY: The difference in volume between action sequences and normal conversation is waaaay too extreme. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume during the action sequences, mainly because I didn't want to wake up the whole neighborhood, not to mention my family!

XTRAS: Not a whole lot. There's a ponderous 2007 interview with Norman Lloyd, who was outstanding as platoon scout Archimbeau in the film. The pace is slow and he rambles off topic quite a bit but you can still pick up a few interesting tidbits if you don't fall asleep along the way. If you are looking for something along the lines of a ""making of"" scenario it ain't here.

""The Men of 'A Walk in the Sun'"" is nothing more than a bio of the leading actors. The chapter menu on the DVD is nicely done but there is no external chapter printout nor anything else for that matter. There is also a movie trailers section including action films I'd never heard of. That was interesting!

The movie itself needs no explanation. I must have seen it a million times. It is one of my top five favorite war films. The pacing, directing by Lewis Milestone and acting are top notch and while there are only a few short action sequences, they are masterfully done and memorable. The film as a low budget marvel. But I just can't get over feeling that this new production should have given us a little more.

So, I've broken down my rating of this new DVD by section as follows:

The movie itself: *****

Picture quality: ****1/2
Sound:  **

Extras: ***1/2

Overall production values: ***

Overall package rating: ****",1262044800,21,2353,4.5738095238095235
4526735,5,B00522VTOM,"Finally!!!! A restored, clean and complete release. The visual effects starting in the landing barge and continuing to the start of the Walk are just awesome.

4526736,5,B00522VTOM,"I remember first seeing this film as a boy growing up in Southern California. Like Lewis Milestone's previous masterpiece, ""All Quiet on the Western Front, about men in combat during WW-I, this film tells a very personal story about what it means for ordinary men being in deadly combat situations. You learn about how much they miss being so far away from home and how frightened they are awaiting their unknown fate.

After watching this film, you cannot but help feeling very sad how brutal and personal war is for those who have to fight it. IMHO, this is a must-see movie for those who want to learn more what war means at a very human level.",1252454400,6,647,4.52991452991453
4526737,4,B00522VTOM,"This WW2 gem has been out in the public domain for many years. Those VHS/DVD's have been dark and grainy and some footage was cut. The movie is based on the bestselling novel of the same name. The story line follows a platoon that has just landed in Italy and is facing their first combat. Their objective is to drive inland from the beach and capture a German held farmhouse. Some very good action/combat sequences. The main story, however, is about the strain of combat and the responsibility of command....and doing your ""duty"". Good individual performances and overall a good (but NOT great) story of WW2. I am taking the mfg's word that the movie has been ""restored"", is ""uncut"", and is in better shape than the one in public domain. Once I view the DVD I'll add to this review.
UPDATED REVIEW...I have watched this DVD and compared it to the ""public domain"" copy I had before. This latest edition is sharp, crisp, and clear with good sound. It could be better if the original film stock were newer but considering the age (@1944) it is a vast improvement over the other. The scenes in the landing craft are still a bit dark but still very viewable. At least now you can see the actors and what they are doing when before there was a black screen. The daylight scenes are very good. Sound is better, too.
There are some extras such as commentary and actor profiles, etc. Overall a much improved version and well worth the money.",1247702400,27,1433,4.536679536679537
4526738,5,B00522VTOM,"I bought the video hoping to see a classic, which I did.  The story was wonderful, both poignant and realistic.  I loved every moment, but this film deserves better than the copies I have viewed. Not one of them does it justice.  Grainyness, skipping, uncoordination of sound and video make viewing difficult.  Come on AFI and the big studios, you could really make this film a gem.  Time to step up and restore it to its former glory.",1184544000,4,435,4.5256410256410255

  Amazing. Over 60 years old and it still ""holds up"".
  It's got a cast that endured for decades as some the finest character actors on the Silver Screen. But more than that its got a  script with some delicious dialogue delivering a melodramatic glimpse of a rather insignificant platoon attacking an enemy occupied farmhouse.
  Superb Continuity and Editing.
  A B&W production that never cries for color.

4526740,5,B00522VTOM,"I use the term ordinary to emphasize just how extraordinary the US infantryman was in WWII. In motion pictures it seems that most war films focus and glorify trained teams sent on secret missions or small groups of elite fighting men trained for a specific purpose. Most of these films never really focus on the men, the morality and camaraderie developed (one exception being THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE) and the day-to-day grind of combat and unsettled nerves. A WALK IN THE SUN is one of a handful of war films that focuses on these endearing elements of civilian men thrown into this mundane (on the surface) yet extraordinary routine of constant exposure to death from enemy ordnance. They are a unit from mixed backgrounds thrown into this maelstrom of uncertainty and death. They develop camaraderie and build trust in each other and execute the daily task they are ordered to without real knowledge of the bigger picture and without specific question of purpose. They get the job done ay any cost whatever the reason. Men die, they grieve and they keep moving. They are on the lowest rung in the field of getting the job done. And they persevere. Recent pictures like SAVING PRIVATE and the restored Sam Fuller epic THE BIG RED ONE have redirected the focus to the lowly ordinary infantryman out there getting the job done. BATTLEGROUND and THE STORY OF G.I. JOE have been around for a while and they too have gotten their deserved recognition. Their greatness comes because they have focused on the men. A WALK IN THE SUN is poetic in nature. Mild mannered Sterling Holloway's death scene is very poignant and difficult to watch and even fathom because of the irony that war has exposed these men to. The diversity of the men is great yet the leader types pick up and take charge when it becomes necessary without any hesitation. Dana Andrews is a man seeing that they get the job done. John Ireland, in one of his better performances, is a distant and cool character that seems like the eyes and ears of the viewer taking in all that transpires. Screenwriter Robert Rossen's script is rich in the character studies of these men including Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges, Norman Lloyd, George Tyne, Huntz Hall and Herbert Rudley under Lewis Milestone's lyrical direction.

4526746,4,B00522VTOM,"A WALK IN THE SUN is a faithful screen adaptation from the novel by Harry Brown.  Director Lewis Milestone relates the events of one day in the journey of a platoon in Italy as they take their 'walk in the sun.' Unlike most movies of the World War II era in which the focus is on the 'big picture', here Milestone limits his camera to record the microcosm of war.  For a film about men in war, the actual amount of fighting is surprisingly negligible.  In fact, the movie contains only two scenes of combat and each lasts only a few moments.  What emerges is a movie that pictures combat with an enemy that is rarely seen and then only in shadows.  As the film begins, a landing craft heads toward the beach at Salerno.  It is the darkness just before dawn.  The soldiers in the craft are warned to be quiet.  Still, despite their caution, their lieutenant is killed by shrapnel, leaving Sergeant Porter (Herbert Rudley) in charge.  As the men hit the beach, they begin to take casualties.  Death seems only to come unexpectedly, quickly, and from far away.  The death of Private McWilliams (Sterling Holloway) points out one of the film's subtexts: that the confusion of war makes it impossible for soldiers to make sense out of a war that is so vast that all they can hope to understand is only their microscopic view of it.  McWilliams is symbolically killed as he tries to use binoculars to peek over a ridge to see the action on the other side.  The Gods of Mars are determined to punish those hubristic soldiers who dare to aspire to a godlike understanding of the chaos of war.  Sergeant Porter suffers mental collapse, leaving Sergeant Tyne (Dana Andrews) now in command.  His orders are to march to a small farmhouse and secure it.  Such an order is simplistic only on its seeming innocuousness.  The company begin their trek toward the farmhouse, and as they walk, we can see individuals emerge from the collective company identity.  There is the usual ethnic breakdown of men in combat. Private Rivera (Richard Conte) plays the Jersey City wisecracking machine gunner always bumming butts from mates.  John Ireland is Windy the philosopher soldier who sees Porter sobbing helplessly and comments, 'Sometimes a wound does not always bleed.' Huntz Hall as Private Carraway is the slightly older version of the Brooklyn East Side Kid from his earlier days as Satch.  Lloyd Bridges as Sergeant Ward dreams of apples as he tries to reconnect to a civilian life that he fears he may never see again. And leading them all is Tyne, whose management philosophy is shaped by the observation of one of his mates: 'Everything in the army is simple: you live or you die.' As they walk, they can hear the war far more than they can see it.  German planes strafe them, shells land amidst them, armored cars appear out of nowhere, and all the while the only warning they have is a brief buzz of noise.  Every few minutes, an offscreen balladeer sings a song, which the audience can hear but the soldiers cannot.  The song takes its cue from the title as it reminds the viewer that the purpose of the trek is to take a 'walk in the warm Italian sun.' The first combat scene reinforces the concept that the enemy is nameless and faceless, though nonetheless deadly for their distance.  A German armored car approaches and the Americans ambush it with grenades and machine gun bullets, causing it to crash and burn.  The audience never sees the faces of any of the Germans.  The only German anatomy that is seen is a hand that appears out of a burning vent.  This hand,in the light of the remainder of the film, can be seen as symbolic of the Americans' view that war is far distant and totally impersonal.  As the Americans approach their objective of the farmhouse, they plot to take it as they earlier had destroyed the armored car.  The Americans attack, and the only view that the audience has of the defenders is that of hands manning machine guns pointing at the attacking Americans. The attack is successful, but the cost is high.  Despite Rivera's oft repeated refrain that 'Nobody dies,' many do, and as the Americans wait for reinforcements, they have time to reconnect with each other.  The irony of Rivera's comment when juxtaposed with Tyne's belief in the simplistic choice of war as leading only to life or death makes A WALK IN THE SUN one of the most powerful war movies ever filmed that try to justify to men why they may have to die and how to keep their sanity even if Private Rivera is right.",1028246400,16,4506,4.595
4526747,5,B00522VTOM,"Lewis Milestone directed the best war films of his time: ""All's Quiet on the Western Front"" (WWI), ""A Walk in the Sun"" (WWII) and ""Pork Chop Hill"" (Korea).  Of the three, ""A Walk in the Sun"", has the least action but the most reflection on what it's like to be the common man at war.
It's more poetry than prose: the soliliquies by John Ireland's character composing letters to his sister; the delightful banter between movie stealing Richard Conte and George Tyne; Norman Llyod as the worried philospher obsessed with a future war in Tibet and Dana Andrews' star turn as the compassionate center of the platoon.
Like poetic refrains, all the major themes are revisted: ""nobody dies""(irony), ""Tibet""(future wars), and ""apples""(precognition).  The signature Milestone tracking shots of impersonal mass slaughter are hypnotic and brutal at the same time.
The wonderful title music ... is tear jerking heroic. Earl didn't like the other music in the film but he was wrong, it works.
I love this film. It's everything you want in a film. It's moving, funny, sad and real. There's not a lot of action with only 2 fight scenes and most of the action occurs off camera which gives it a reverential reserve and a deliberate narrow point of view.  The viewer takes that walk in the sun with the platoon and is limited to what they can see and hear just like a real infantryman.  There is no B.S.and it's G rated with no extraneous violence.

The quality is absolutely terrible and if the cost didn't make a return not worth my while, I would have returned this video.  The sound quality is so bad that the dialogue can hardly be heard at times (quite often in fact) -- there is also a steady hum that can be heard throughout the movie.  The picture quality is a joke.  At times the picture drops out completely and you see nothing but static.  Add to that the missing footage and you come up with a video that is not worth the money!

The action scenes were spare but very effective. The final assault on the  farmhouse occupied by Germans and their dreaded machine guns is one of the  most memorable few minutes in war film history.
However, viewers may have  great difficulty obtaining a complete version with good video quality. Over  the years VHS tapes and even the current DVD have been remiss in either  completeness or picture quality. I think this may be due in part to the  film's having been public domain for so many years.
Nevertheless, a  laserdisc version was produced in about 1991 0r 1992 and has excellent  picture quality and is a complete version to boot. The only downside of the  disc is the poor sound quality which can be levelled and enhanced with an  updated sound system.

The dialogue, acting, tension buildup, realism, psychology, and  photography/camera work are nothing short of superb.  It is a film way  ahead of its time, true to its genre, and probably the best/most realistic  film to come out of WWII. Many of the ethnic/cultural stereotypes are quite  good, even considering the absence of African-American roles, probably  fairly accurate for the time. The depiction of war seems very genuine.  Does anyone know what Dana Andrews meant when he said ""4 ways from the  jack?""  What a shame that the DVD version by Madacy is so poor. There  are video/digital dropouts, terrible sound, missing frames.  The VHS and  BETA versions are of better quality overall. There is no evidence of ANY  Dolby Digital sound.
I hope someone will recognize the true artistry of  this film and issue it in a better DVD version.

4526753,5,B00522VTOM,"The best review I can give this is to pass along my Dad's, who has always thought this the best work Hollywood ever did on the life he lived in 1944-45.  Dad went ashore as a 2nd Lt. from Texas A&M at Utah Beach on  D+40, latched onto a slot in the 47th Infantry, 9th Division, and fought  through the bocage, Operation Cobra, the Falaise Gap, breakout and pursuit  through France and Belgium, the Huertgen Forest, the Frenzerburg, the  Northern shoulder of the Bulge, and was breaking out of the Remagen  bridgehead when he was wounded in March of 1945.  He says that  ""Walk"" captures the sense of confusion, of the ratio of boredom  to adrenaline, of beauty and humor to random death and pure human  stupidity, just about right.  Almost the only other WWII film I have heard  him comment on favorably was ""Saving Private Ryan.""
