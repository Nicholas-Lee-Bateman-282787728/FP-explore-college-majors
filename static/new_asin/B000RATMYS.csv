8199884,3,B000RATMYS,"The quality of the DVD is horrible but this is someone who can sing a phone book and make it majestic. I have not seen the other ""Dreams of Rome"" DVD ( it has to be better quality) but if it is the man and his music and his personna you are interested in it is worth the money and the necessary squinting.",1390867200,,305,3.857142857142857
8199885,1,B000RATMYS,"This is a SAMPLER, not a full DVD.  It would appear Amazon put the other customer's CD review in the wrong place.
There are just two songs taken from the ""Dreams of Rome"" concert Vittorio did several years ago.  Vittorio is a great singer - yes - but don't waste $20 on this.  You can buy his ""Dreams of Rome"" DVD, the entire concert, for the same price.",1296345600,,354,4.176470588235294
8199886,5,B000RATMYS,I was deghted with this CD.  Love hearing new performers and both tracks of Miracle touch my heart every time I listen to them.,1257292800,,127,4.291666666666667
