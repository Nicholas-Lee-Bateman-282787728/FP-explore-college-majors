8214357,5,B000UQ45DM,Absolutely amazing everyone should watch a video like this. Paul is enjoyable entertaining and educational. My family won't be embarrassed when we go have a fine meal. This should be taught in every school!,1516752000,,206,5.088235294117647
8214358,5,B000UQ45DM,"Everyone should see this, especially the young ones of what proper manners is all about. A great learning tool for all.",1411862400,,119,4.714285714285714
8214359,3,B000UQ45DM,"I bought this DVD as a future professional hoping to get some tips on good etiquette.  I thought the information for table manners was good, but at times it was very simplistic and cheesy.  While anyone could learn from this DVD, it is more geared towards teaching etiquette to a family with kids.

If you are hoping to get some business etiquette tips, know that this DVD focuses only on table manners.",1241740800,,403,4.569444444444445
8214360,3,B000UQ45DM,"Mr. Dreher included some good information in his DVD that I did not think to include in my DVD's, ""American Dining & Entertaining Etiquette; Manners for the Table,"" and ""American Etiquette for a Formal Party; Manners for the Hosts, Guests and Catering Staff,"" when I created them in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Therefore, I would recommend that anyone interested in getting as much knowledge as he or she can about table manners or other general etiquette, purchase this video.

However, Mr. Dreher got a few things wrong on the 'dining' aspect of his DVD.  For example, if anything is passed at the table, bread, butter, etc., it should be passed counter clockwise around the table using the hand over hand method.  (See my first mentioned DVD.)  Mr. Dreher passed the roll basket in a very awkward fashion which is not correct.

Also, soup should be eaten from the side of the bowl.  Mr. Dreher ate his from the tip.

Since I was born in 1943, raised by parents who dined in a formal style every night and at the dining room table after church on Sunday, was a sorority girl in 1961, my mother's sorority, and was a Home Economics major in college, I was taught the American style of eating, which, since I am a proud American, I use to eat my meals today.  Mr. Dreher didn't seem to know the American style of dining particulary well, or if he did, he sure didn't spend much time on the nuances of it.

The man guest in the video, for example, put his knife onto the place mat after he had used it!!!  Horror of all horrors.  Perhaps Mr. Dreher didn't notice this or perhaps he didn't want to embarrass the man, but this is a very big, ""NO, NO!""  Again, for the correct placement of utensils while dining, see either or both of my DVD's.

For the placement of the knife and fork at the end of the meal, Mr. Dreher had them up at the top of the plate.  I learned they should be at the 4:20 position on the plate (think of your plate as a clock) to signal the waiter that the diner is through with his meal.  I also go into the European way to show a finished position in my DVD's.

The napkin should be placed on the chair if the diner gets up in the middle of the meal while others are still dining, I think Mr. Dreher covered this verbally, but it should be placed to the left of the plate at the end of the meal when all diners are getting up from the table.  No folding necessary.

Whether you use the American or the European style of dining - both are correct, by the way - elbows should be at the side of your body.  Also, I learned that one's hand, in my case the left hand, should be placed in my lap while I am using my right hand with the fork in it to eat my food.  There are a couple of thoughts on this but the true American way of dining is to place the hand that is not holding the fork in your lap.  The knife should be placed across the upper right hand area of the plate with the blade turned down when actually eating.

One of the things that Mr. Dreher mentioned that I did not think of when I produced my DVD's was Dress Code, what to wear when asked to a party.  This is probably the most commonly asked question I get on my emails and it is a tough one.  Since nobody seems to know the 'offcial' dress codes anymore, hosts make up some of the most interesting names for the attire that they want their guests to wear.  It never ceases to amaze me what terminology they use for attire.

Mr. Dreher suggested that the guest ask the host what to wear if there isn't a designated dress code on the invitation.  I say, unless you are VERY sure that you know exactly how your host wants you to dress, ask your host what to wear when you call to RSVP.  Nobody wants to show up in blue jeans and a tattered ""T"" shirt when everyone else is in dressy attire, or vice versa

Again, I would recommend Mr. Dreher's DVD.  On our products' sites on Amazon, it appears that Amazon is recommending that people buy my DVD's as well as Mr. Dreher's.  I would recommend that also as well as my booklet, ""Tips on Modern American Dining Etiquette,"" which covers even more information than either of my DVD's or Mr. Dreher's.

Thank you, Mr. Dreher, for joining the fight to teach Americans some of the finer facts about etiquette!!! Good for you.",1219795200,16,4250,4.254047322540473
