If you have not bought the previous individual sets, then get this 5-star set! The restoration is wonderful! They look like they were filmed yesterday! Kudos to Sony Home Video for this wonderful presentation!

New Bonus Contents Included are (and these WILL also be available separately outside of this set):

Disc #1
Rockin' In The Rockies (1945) (feature film with Curly)
Have Rocket--Will Travel (1958) (feature film with Curly-Joe)
Columbia Color Rhapsody cartoons:
 The Bon Bon Parade (1935)
 The Merry Mutineers (1936)
 A Hollywood Detour (1942)

Disc #2
SHEMP HOWARD solo shorts:
Most of these solo shorts have Stooge story lines and will leave you missing the other Stooges. It can seem strange to see other actors do the Stooges roles. They are curiosities for sure, but I have yet to find a five-star comedy here.

 HOME ON THE RANGE (1938) - An Andy Clyde comedy.
  After getting bit by Andy's dog, Andy;s wife & brother-in-law (Shemp) plot to kill the dog. Andy over hears this and thinks they are trying to kill him. Hard for animal lovers to watch.

 THE GLOVE SLINGERS (1939) - The Glove Slingers series
  Fight promoter Shemp hires Noah Beery Jr. (Rockford Files) to be the new boxing champ, fighting his girlfriend's brother!

 MONEY SQUAWKS (1940) - An Andy Clyde comedy.
  Railway station operators Andy & Shemp watch over a payroll that arrived, protecting it from bandits. Their antics make this one of the best solo Shemp shorts made.

 BOOBS IN THE WOODS (1940) - An Andy Clyde comedy.
  Shemp is the brother-in-law again as he joins Andy & his wife on a hunting trip. His abrasive personality keeps this from being as good as it could have been.

 PLEASED TO MITT YOU (1940) - The Glove Slingers series.
  School kids are having a party at Shemp's house. The kids prepare the food just as Curly would, but without his bewilderment. They even mistake a pot-holder for fresh cake & put icing on it.

 PICK A PECK OF PLUMBERS (1944) - with El Brendel
  El Brendel & Shemp basically re-make ""A Plumbing We Will Go"". Neither directly takes on the role of any Stooge, but they merge some of the Stooge roles for two characters. (see note below for blooper)

 OPEN SEASON FOR SAPS (1944)
  Marital mix-ups as Shemp enters the wrong apartment to find his old girlfriend and her insanely jealous husband. The Shemp's wife finds him!

 OFF AGAIN, ON AGAIN (1945) - with Christine McIntyre,  Joe Palma (who later impersonated Shemp after Shemp died.)
  Despondent Shemp hires a gangster to do him in.

 WHERE THE PEST BEGINS (1945) - co-starring Tom Kennedy with Christine McIntyre
  Almost like a RKO Edger Kennedy Comedy as Shemp antagonizes his new neighbor Tom.

 A HIT WITH A MISS (1945) - with Charles Rogers, Joe Palma (who later impersonated Shemp after Shemp died.)
  Shemp again re-makes a Stooge comedy. Here it is ""Punch Drunks"", complete with stock footage from that film. Shemp is the punchy waiter replacing Curly.

 Mr. NOISY (1946) - with Vernon Dent
  Re-making Charley Chase's ""The Heckler"", Shemp takes on the role of an obnoxious loud baseball fan at the game.

 JIGGERS, MY WIFE (1946) - with Tom Kennedy, Christine McIntyre
  Again Shemp has a suspicious wife thinking there is another woman.

 SOCIETY MUGS (1946) - co-starring Tom Kennedy with Snub Pollard, Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre.
  Tom & Shemp re-make the Stooges ""Termites of 1938"" as exterminators who are mistaken for party escorts.

 BRIDE AND GLOOM (1947) - with Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre.
  After being late for his wedding, Shemp's fiance doesn't believe that the blond girl with Shemp is just an innocent situation. To make matters worse, Shemp keeps running across the same blond woman, causing chaos to his marriage.  Another solid Shemp solo comedy.

Disc #3
Joe Besser solo shorts:
Unlike Shemp, Besser rarely re-make Stooge comedies as they were not his style.

 WAITING IN THE LURCH (1949) - with Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre.
 DIZZY YARDBIRD (1950) - with Emil Sitka
 FRAIDY CAT (1950) - with Tom Kennedy, Joe Palma.
  Re-make of the Stooges ""Dizzy Detectives""
 AIM, FIRE, SCOOT (1952)
 CAUGHT ON THE BOUNCE (1952)
 SPIES AND GUYS (1953) - with Emil Sitka
 THE IRE CHASER (1954) - with Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre, Joe Palma.
 G.I. DOOD IT (1955) - with Emil Sitka
 HOOK A CROOK (1955) - with Dan Blocker (Bonanza), Tom Kennedy, Joe Palma.
  A re-make of the above ""Fraidy Cat"" which was a re-make of the Stooges ""Dizzy Detectives"".
 ARMY DAZE (1956)

Joe DeRita solo shorts:

 SLAPPILY MARRIED (1946) - with Christine McIntyre, Dorothy Granger
 THE GOOD BAD EGG (1947) - with Dorothy Granger, Vernon Dent, Symona Boniface.
 WEDLOCK DEADLOCK (1947) - with Christine McIntyre, Patsy Moran, Dorothy Granger.
 JITTER BUGHOUSE (1948) - with The Nov-Elites, Christine McIntyre, Emil Sitka, Patsy Moran.

**UPDATED*** Bonus contents footnote...

NOT included is Shemp's first solo Columbia short NOT GUILTY ENOUGH (1938) which is one of his Andy Clyde series appearances, and Besser's CUCKOORANCHO (1938) which was produced in New York by Ben K. Blake. SONY HAS EXPLAINED THAT THEY CAN NOT FIND THE FILM ELEMENTS FOR THESE TWO SHORTS! Basically, they are lost.

Blooper Alert:

On Disc #2 in the ""Starring Shemp"" section.
12:45 into the short PICK A PECK OF PLUMBERS as water crashes down from the ceiling onto some women playing cards, watch the bottom left corner of the screen as a stage hand jumps up into the camera's view for several frames. He must have gotten wet from the splash!

5024540,5,B006WN5W5M,"How can someone write a negative review on something that hasn't been released yet? If you don't like the repackaging, don't buy it. I have no problem with Sony actions. We all have to make a buck.
The anti-capitalist negative reviews are typical of a moonbat segment of our society. This is actually a good deal. The additional Shemp shorts are worth the 90 bucks.",1330128000,10,365,4.630769230769231
5024541,1,B006WN5W5M,"Thanks to Sony for the giant kick in the rear!  After buying all the volumes, they're now re-releasing them in their original packages along with a bonus set of DVD's.  What a rip-off for the fans that already bought all the volumes and just want the bonus discs.  Hopefully they'll listen to their fans and release the bonus set seperately.  Also, the shorts that were released in the original volumes that were presented in the ""widescreen"" format weren't actually filmed that way.  Columbia, or Sony, simply cropped the tops and bottoms of the later shorts to have them appear to have been filmed in widescreen.  Why was this done?  The only thing I can think is that they released these shorts to theaters that were showing full length features that were in the widescreen format, which was new to that era.  If these shorts would be released in their original full screen format and remastered, I'd gladly buy them again.  Not holding my breath, though!",1329436800,37,958,4.757575757575758

5024611,5,B006WN5W5M,"Everything a Stooge fan can want.  Every short film they did is included in this set, and the bonus material is superb.  It contains solo shorts by Shemp (before he rejoined the Stooges) and Curly Joe (billed as Joe de Rita).  The biggest surprise (for me at least) are the shorts by Joe Besser.  Most Stooge fans acknowledge that Joe was the worst stooge (his style didn't mesh with Moe and Larry that well), but his detractors rarely mention that Joe had his own career before becoming a Stooge, and the solo shorts included in this set show that he was very funny by himself, and you end up appreciating his comedy style more after watching.  Another wonderful thing I like about this set is that some of the later shorts were shot after widescreen photography came into play, and they are present in their original aspect ratio (1.85:1 to be exact).  Columbia didn't do this stuff half a**ed.  They went all out, and they should be commended for it.  The restorations look incredible.

It would have been nice if they included all the movies the Stooges did (there are only 2 included in the set), and maybe a documentary on the Stooges, but that's OK. I can live with that.  A great set for all Stooge fans.",1506124800,4,1212,4.518348623853211

What a find this collection is!  Not one physical flaw in any of the reproductions or the packaging.  The picture quality, superb.  The audio is reminiscent of the time and produced as well as it could be.  Even though I've never been an avid fan of the Stooges, I've always appreciated their slapstick when that particularly zany mood hit.  Can't testify to what's included/what's missing but I will say whenever I take the time to watch these episodes it will be time enjoyed.
The packaging is well thought out and solidly built.  Each disc has its own slimline case, with the dvd printing matching the background picture.  Very creative!!

I wish I was related to them so I can have that special bond, but since I'm not, the DVDs will do just fine. There's hours of Stooge shorts and it will take you a very long time to go through the entire collection. I'm half way through and can sit for hours watching them.

The collection starts with Curly and then changes over to Shemp after Curly suffered a nasty stroke. After Shemp died, they added Curly Joe. This collection brings back a lot of childhood memories and reminds me of how happy we were to see the opening credits and that damn theme song! Love it! We put it on for the kids because we were absolutely sick of anything that Netflix had to offer and they couldn't stop laughing. Couldn't believe it.",1487030400,,795,4.3

5024761,5,B006WN5W5M,"If you are a Three Stooges fan, this is the collection for you! I have had this set myself for several years and I absolutely love it. I purchased this set as a gift for my sister because she liked mine so much.
Each disc set inside the main box is organized by year with multiple discs which have shorts spanning each year range. Each year range has an outer sleeve with slim (but sturdy) dvd cases to hold the discs nicely. Each disc set has the episode listing on the back so if you aren't sure when an episode was made you can easily find it by title. There is also another set of 3 discs with additional shorts starring Joe Besser as well as a few full length movies and a few cartoons.
If you like the movies or cartoons this probably isn't the set for you (i believe there are only 3 of each) but if you enjoy the shorts this set includes most (if not all) of the shorts made.
The packaging is great overall. The outer box is simple, but very eye catching and the design of each individual set inside is very nice so that you can display the collection individually without the outer ultimate collection box to make it more accessible for use if you chose.
I highly recommend this set to any Stooges fan.",1482624000,2,1211,4.224137931034483

5024767,5,B006WN5W5M,"THE THREE STOOGES: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION: Short on physical stature but long on face slaps, cream pies, seltzer bottles, and really bad haircuts, THE THREE STOOGES are universally heralded as the longest lived and most recognizable comedy team of all time...except by those who HATE them. Each new generation of kids (and male adults who never grew up) readily acknowledge, adore and imitate the twisted trio's timeless routines...LAUREL & HARDY, THE MARX BROTHERS and ABBOTT & COSTELLO should have such rabid fan bases. Any almalgamated moron will tell you the ""real"" THREE STOOGES were MOE (the bossy one), LARRY (the under-used one), and CURLY (the funniest one)...with a nod to CURLY's successor, the maniacally mannered SHEMP. Paling in comparison were the two average Joe's who followed, namely whiney JOE BESSER, recruited to finish out the trio's film shorts contract, and rotund CURLY JOE, who turned up in their later full length motion pictures and el cheapo cartoon series. Anti-authority plots, goofy sound effects, oft-recycled jokes, and endlessly quotable catch phrases resonated with millions of fans worldwide, making THE THREE STOOGES ""coitenly"" the most beloved knuckleheads in pop cuture history.

I hope that more of this generation of youth appreciate these classics.  That and the Little Rascals.  Although I've read that the definitive collection of the Little Rascals is horrible, I'm glad this one wasn't.  The picture quality is so nice and the sound is good too.  Now, I know back then the picture and sound were as good as they could make it, but the picture on a 1080i TV looks fantastic.  I have a 55"" LCD screen and it looks so good.

However, nearly all the contents from 1953 to '59 are in Faux-Widescreen compared to how they've been seen on TV all these years! Like the classic Looney Tunes shorts, all of these Stooge classics were shot in Fullscreen to begin with, in this collection at least! Only 1 of the 6 Stooge movies is in this set; Have Rocket Will Travel, but it can be seen with the other 4 from Columbia in Mill Creek's Stooge 6-Movie set; Snow White and the Three Stooges remains with Fox (originally in CinemaScope) on DVD, and has since been put in their vaults; any new copies of that one will be really expensive! Other than most of the movies, you get virtually the entire Columbia Stooges era in this collection, including a bunch of solo shorts in the Rarities set! Two more solo shorts were excluded from this set, since their original negatives were never found, to restore them.

5024872,5,B006WN5W5M,"Awesome, super complete. Only thing is that it only includes English language, but for the rest it's awesome.",1464307200,,109,5.111111111111111
5024873,5,B006WN5W5M,Perhaps the greatest comedy team in Hollywood history and the highest grossing ... and its no wonder ... this is comic GENIUS!!!!!,1463961600,,130,4.954545454545454
5024884,5,B006WN5W5M,"It  is  all  slapping  good  humor.  If  someone  makes  a  mistake,  or  touches  Moe's  face  with  a  paint brush,  guess  what  he  does?  Pinches  your  nose,  or  bops  you  on  the  head  with  his  fist.  &  its  a  very  laughable  thing  watching  Moe  trying  to  get  some  sense  into  both  Larry  &  Curly!  That's  what  I  like  best  about  the  show.  It  never  falls  flat.  I  love  all  the  jokes,  Curly's  jokes  anyways.  &  then  you  got  Shemp  who  replaces  Curly's  absence  in  some  of  the  episodes.  He's  funny  too.  &  Lets  say  they  get  a  job  as  auto  mechanics,  Plumbers,  carpenters,  that's  when  we  all  witness  the  silliness.  Or  take  a  job  as  painters,  trying  to  start  their  own  plumbing  company,  I  love  it  all.  In  the  mid  80's  I'd  catch  the  show  in  the  mornings  usually  between  8  &  10 am.  I  never  bothered  very  much  to  watch  anything  else.
In  my  opinion  the  3  stooges  is  about  the  best  there  is  as  far  as  comedy  goes!  I  wouldn't  ask  for  a  funnier  show!!!!!!!!!!!  All  the  mistakes  they  make  are  like  no  other  that  you'll  see.  I  chose  to  skip  watching  the  new  movie  that  just  recently  came  out  because  comedy  isn't  what  it  use  to  be.  I  think  I'd  watch  this  show  any  day.  About  the  theme  song,  whether  or  not  (The Pop  goes  the  weasel  was  the  first  thing  to  ever  do  this  version  of  the  song  or  if  it  was  played  as  the  theme  song  for  the  3  stooges  first,  I  don't  know).  The  theme  song  is  played  a  little  different.  My  favorite  theme  song  is  the  one  where  it  sounds  like  birds  chirping.
If  you  want  top  of  the  line  jokes  &  absolute  silliness  then  this  show  is  for  you!!
I  now  own  the  show,  just  recently  bought  this  not  too  long  ago.  &  the  quality  appears  to  be  good.  It  doesn't  seem  to  have  every  episode  the  3  stooges  ever  did,  I  thought  it  did.  Comes  close  though.
Some  episodes  are  so  hilarious  its  difficult  to  stop  laughing!

You  may  find  too  much  of  the  same  episodes  with  Shemp.  Not  enough  of  something  different.  &  that's  the  only  thing  that  disappointed  me  just  a  tad.
The  box  holding  the  series  DVD's  in  was  little  messed  up.  So  I  had  to  tape  that  up.  Aside  from  that  I  am  very  satisfied.",1463184000,,2432,4.151133501259446

The picture is sharp, the audio is crisp and clear, and there isn't a lot of artifacts or poor upscaling that you see in other transfers.  I would have preferred a better box to store these in because it opens up at the top and it's very thin cardboard.  It's pretty hard to take individual dvd's out unless you turn the box over and pour them out.  Considering the quality of the video and pure joy I get from Curly doing his thing, I can't fault them, really, for box design.

It's categorized extremely well by season, and each one has detailed information on the what episodes are included in each.  The quality of the video is clear that it has been remastered, and it's great to be able to see all of these in restored versions.

As time goes on, less and less people are going to buy these. The kids today don't really know them and don't really have the patience to watch films anymore, let alone black and white ones made 85 years ago!

Every episode has a black mat around it so the screen is much smaller than your television, and the movies are kinda boring. We started to watch one of the movies and decided to go back to the episodes. The western movie was one of their older ones and it was more of a musical, not much stooge-dome in it.

The Stooges are a bit like licorice: not everyone like licorice, but those who like licorice REALLY like licorice.  For Stooge fans, this is the whole candy store -- all 190 shorts and 3 bonus disks besides; and at less than 25 cents a film, it's a screaming bargain.

I didn't really like Joe or Curly Joe (although Curly Joe is not in any of these shorts) because they weren't as funny as Curly and Shemp. I was about 8 or 9 years old when I first started watching the Stooges, but I didn't really become a fan of them until I was 10. The very first Stooge short that I saw was ""The Tooth Will Out"". Then I watched more shorts on several shows and on their website. After that, I came to this collection. I would have to say that Volume Three is my favorite because that volume is packed with so many hilarious shorts. This collection is totally worth it for ALL Stooge fans. It really has great quality and is very enjoyable. I just can't stop laughing. I have many favorite shorts but my all-time favorite short is ""No Census, No Feeling"".",1428278400,,869,4.209580838323354

5025143,5,B006WN5W5M,"I was such a great Three Stooge fan as a kid and this one comes with all of the episodes. I think most people looking for this will likely already be a fan of the series, so I am not going to spend too much time reviewing the episodes. However, it has all of the slapstick comedy, word play and silly comedy you can imagine.

If you are a fan of the series and are wondering if you should get this boxed set when you can find most episodes on YouTube, I would still say yes. A lot of times when you buy boxed sets of old television series, they don't do much more than transfer what appears VHS quality video over and call it a day. Not the case with this collection. The video remastering is excellent quality and looks great even on my 60"" television. You would almost think that the stooges were originally recorded in HD. It would be nice if there was a blu-ray option so you don't have to deal with so many discs, but that is a small complaint.",1422144000,2,949,4.129729729729729

Haven't had time to watch all of this stuff yet; there is much here to keep a Three Stooges fan occupied for long periods!

5025355,5,B006WN5W5M,Hi this is big John again I'm finally leaving my review for this awesome collection I paid $39.99 for this collection and I feel like I ripped Amazon off you get all the shorts from 1934 till 1959 also a bonus dvd with stooges cartoons some movies featuring shemp and curly joe that dvd is also sold separately but it is included In this amazing collection this boxed set is for fans of knuckle heads but if you buy from any other site they usually charge more this collection has my all time favorite shorts punch drunks three little pig skins heavenly daze in my opinion that's shemps best short if you find a mini collection of the stooges with a book its a great compliment to this amazing and articulate collection I'm also a fan of laurel and hardy they are just a very small percentage funnier than the three stooges so check out my review for laurel and hardy it will help you decide to order Their essential collection a must own for all ages and fans of true comedy so in short I put my reputation on the line when I recommend laurel and hardy and the three stooges the true kings of comedy,1406678400,2,1100,4.318840579710145

Now, with this set, I can be assured of having ALL the Curly episodes, ALL the Shemp episodes, ALL the Joe Besser episodes all in one big set. The movies and bonus material is nice too.
The one thing that stands about this set is the quality of the video. It is extremely clear and sharp. Amazing what digital technology can do. The first thing I said when I popped in the first DVD was ""Wow, look at how sharp that picture is""!!

I've never seen any of them look this good.  My wife (yes, my wife likes the Stooges! WOOO) and I have worked through '35 & '36, working on '37 and '38 now.  Many, many more discs and shorts to go.  Look for names and faces that are familiar, including Lucille Ball (!!) in one of the early shorts.  Watching this much Stooges in a row you see some things that you might not have noticed - for years I'd see one or two or 5 shorts, but then go a long time before seeing anymore.  Seeing 10 in a row you notice things.  For instance: the looks.  Larry, Curly and Moe have signature looks, and damned if I don't laugh EVERY TIME on a few of them.  ""Spread out!"" being one.  Anyway, do yourself a favor and splurge on this set.

You get all the shorts and some bonus solo shorts by Shemp, Joe Besser and Joe DeRita -the latter ones being more than a little boring, but hey, it's okay - you'll merely appreciate the genius comedic work of the original Stooges all the more! This big box set is unwieldy and cumbersome, and the design demarcation is so silly that you have to pull out all the discs to determine what you want to watch.  But after scrutinizing the clarity of the widescreen picture (don't shoot until you see the bags under their eyes...) and slip sliding through the ease of disc navigation without any annoying menu music or nyuks, gaahs, or whoas, makes all efforts to watch wholly worthwhile.  You need to grab yourself this wonderful set at this superb price, as the folks at Columbia are still scavenging millions of pennies (even off YouTube - no need to pay there when you can have this now and forever!) off the shining brilliance of this trio.

The Stooges never received the attention they deserved when they made these shorts and they are classic comedy. How many of today's comedians will be this big eight decades from now? When you see Moe whack Curly on the head with a hammer, one of two things will happen. Either you'll say ""Oh my God, how violent!"" or you'll get it and laugh hysterically. I'll take it you are in the second group and instead of hating them you love 'em!

I'll have to save the review of the quality of the remastering for later. Either way, they are the Stooges! I used to watch these as a kid on a black & white TV with a old UHF loop antenna and I'm sure the funniness will still be there!",1390780800,4,794,4.217105263157895

Moe, Larry, Curly and sometimes Shemp & Joe, get caught up in embarrassing, but unstoppable laughter as they try to run away from the bad guys, half-baked job assignments and everything else in between!!

It's a nonstop collection of comedy shorts that'll have you laughing until your sides begin to ache!! You'll want to treasure this set of DVD'S and watch them again and again and again!! In glorious black & white!!

I purchased the collection to watch them again with my grand kids when they get little older and could enjoy slap stick comedy. One important thing for me is that the episodes are free from any colorful language and also half naked bodies. The fun is clean and enjoyable with kids. The print looked soft but there are clean ( no dust or scratches etc.). The sound is clearer then the broadcast TV.  The best part is that you can now have a complete collection of all the episodes in one BOX, which, is cheaper and better than the a la carte DVDs. Loving it ..",1390176000,3,709,4.2518518518518515

The quality is crystal clear plus the extras are so cool. My only complaint is that instead of one of the Joe Derita theatrical film, it would have been better if Sony included Time Out For Rhythm with Curly,Moe and Larry.

What was a surprise to see that Joe DeRita (with hair) was funny. Certainly funnier than he was in the 1960s features.

With all the complaints about Joe Besser.with the Stooges in shorts (completely justified I might.add) I enjoyed his work elsewhere like on t he old Joey Bishop. Show and as Stinky in Abbott and Costello routines.

Anyway, this is Stooge Heaven..'

5025456,4,B006WN5W5M,"Laurel & Hardy, Abbot & Costello and others were great comedy teams in their own ways. In my way of thinking, none of them were as crazy, Zany or just plain insane as the Three Stooges. For the first time ever all 190 Columbia shorts are now packaged together in one massive 20 disc set. Whoever was behind the re-mastering of these shorts did a bang up job-I mean you can hear clearly the slaps, bangs on the head, the punches and hits to the face-the pokes in the eyes-unlike on TV, you can really feel the hits! Bravo to the team who was behind the re-mastering these discs.

This collection also includes a 3 disc set of rarities. 2 Feature films, 3 cartoons and 28 shorts starring individual members of the stooges. And yes this set is available for purchase separately for those who already have the individual volumes(8 in all). I'm glad I waited for this complete collection-because you get it all for one reasonable price. To buy the sets individually would cost $100+- here you get it all for less than $70(Including shipping)as of this writing.

Just one word about the case for the Bonus set: They have the 3 discs one on top of the others on a spindle-this is perhaps my lone gripe of this collection. This is no way to pack DVDs. Do not however let this deter you-if you love the stooges-this is a must have collection.

UPDATE--7-28-14
It saddens me to inform readers that I had reduced my 5 star rating to 4 Not for the DVDs, those are top quality. It is for the last two sets in this collection, 7 and 8. Most of the shorts in the last two sets are remakes. Some of the remakes do offer a different spin on the originals-but most of them don't improve on the originals, it does the opposite. I mean when watching the shorts in 7 and 8, I say to my self ""I swore I saw that one already""

I still say the stooges were the best-there hasn't been anything before or since.",1388620800,3,1885,4.331444759206799

5025459,5,B006WN5W5M,"Let me first say that I have been a Three Stooges fans for decades. Since my childhood, I remember some of the funniest lines from the Three Stooges. My favorite has always been the Shemp episodes and for whatever reasons I'm unsure of, near impossible to find.

On some occasions, certain networks show the Three Stooges rather randomly but they always been Curly episodes and a whole lot of repeated episodes almost every time you watch it.

Throughout the years I came across various dvds and partials of the Three Stooges, none of which features Shemp even if the cover has a picture of him. My main way of ever hoping to watch the show was to record it on vhs and hope that I can re-watch it sometime. I sometimes see Three Stooges collections at the movie stores, but it was very unclear how to complete such collection.

So in comes this ultimate dvd collection. Let me say I was very skeptical at first. My thought were exactly, ""No way this could be the complete ultimate collection that features every Curly, Shemp, and Joe films."" Sure enough it is, and I'm very glad to have purchased this. I don't know when this DVD was released or for how easy it is to access Shemp episodes. I'm just glad to finally come across the dvds and am very glad I can watch it. I found many episodes I completely forgotten about including the one where Shemp was in a stolen box car and had a drunken vision of a bird. Other funny episodes include where Shemp had this fishbowl stuck on his head after attempting to get his inheritance money.

To my surprise a lot of Three Stooges episodes are rehashes of other episodes but in various formats. To me the Three Stooges are the funniest but also some of Hollywood most tragic actors and certainly shows the evil and corruption of Hollywood. I know some writers of the shows actually committed suicide after going bankrupt. All the Stooges had broken bones and Curly and Shemp both suffered tragic, sudden deaths. As you all know Shemp came on the show after Curly and a lot of Shemp's episodes are remakes of earlier Curly episodes. Even more surprising after Shemp died, they simply re-used a lot of his films for future versions until Joe came into the picture. All that is within this Ultimate Collection of Three Stooges. You also get some very nice missing episodes that are very rare. You get 3d glasses, which I haven't tried yet in fear of losing the glasses.

Overall I am very happy to own this. I am very thankful that finally the full collection has been released and I enjoy every minute of this collection. It's one of my most prized item and I certainly hope that everyone can experience the Three Stooges.",1388275200,30,2663,4.539583333333334

I don't know why but I just can't fight the urge to pick up the nearest sturdy object and smack someone up side the head after watching this. One of my friends lost his eye after my other friend repeatedly poked his eye yelling ""Nyuck Nyuck Nyuck"" All in all I had to sell these to my prick cousin Bobby because I got tired of cleaning up the bloody mess at my house after watching these films. He has since broken his leg, fractured his arm and lost his pointer finger because his friend ripped it off after being repeatedly poked in the eye. I have however been able to expand my small painting company to include various other types of activities inspired by the jobs the Stooges did. I've hired 30 new employees in total but only 4 are still on the staff... most left citing the need to work in a more professional environment or some pansy excuse about out of pocket medical expenses.

This set, which I received as a birthday present in 2013, represents the most complete Stooges collection to be found in one package. The one caveat is that this set is not a complete career retrospective of the group, as most of the feature films made after the Stooges split from Columbia Pictures, featuring Curly Joe DeRita, are not included here. That said, most people know the Three Stooges from their two-reel shorts, all of which are included here, and the bonus DVD set with additional shorts and movies is a nice touch. If you're a die-hard fan you may be disappointed that not everything the Three Stooges ever did was included here, but for the money it's hard to beat this set.",1387929600,,807,4.534246575342466

5025468,5,B006WN5W5M,You cant beat the Three Stooges when it comes to comedy. This Ultimate collection is just that. You get 20 DVD's in one huge box set for the awesome price of $29.96 plus shipping. I searched other websites and the price for this set was $60 or higher including shipping. I grew up with the Three Stooges back in the 80's I would come home from school and turn on the tv  and watch them and I would laugh until my side hurt and would still laugh again and again. When you open this huge set you will notice 9 more boxes. All of the first seven sets have 2 DVD's with them and the 8th set has 3 DVD's as does the 9th DVD set. The 9th set is bonus content some of which has never been released on DVD or VHS at all until now. If you or someone you know is a huge Three Stooges fan then this is the set to get. You can buy the 8 sets on individual DVD box sets ( the 9th set isn't available as far as I know ) then you would spend more money on the price plus shipping then you would buying this huge set. Buying this huge set will save you more $$$$$$$$$$$$ in the long run and it makes a perfect Christmas gift for any Three Stooges fan. In this set you get all 190 shorts that every member of the Three Stooges ever made from Moe Larry and Curly and Shemp to Joe Besser and Curly Joe Derita,1387497600,2,1289,3.901140684410646

5025484,5,B006WN5W5M,"This is one of the best box sets ever released, featuring all 190 Three Stooges' short subjects in chronological order, from 1934 to 1959.  Moe Howard was the undisputed leader of the Stooges, and Larry Fine was fine as the beleaguered man in the middle.  Curly Howard was a comic genius, and remains the best remembered and most loved of all of the Stooges.  Even when his health declined, his performances remained amazingly hilarious.  Also included in this box set is ""Rockin' In The Rockies"" (1945), a feature film in which Curly and Larry interact more with each other than with Moe.  Its value is more in its rarity than its quality, in my humble opinion.  Shemp Howard joined the Three Stooges after Curly suffered a major stroke, and first appeared in the short ""Fright Night"" (1947).  After watching the bonus short subjects featuring Shemp, I gained a greater appreciation for his comedic talents.  Every Three Stooges short with Shemp never failed to make me laugh.  ""Spooks!"" (1953) and ""Pardon My Backfire"" (1953) with Shemp were filmed in 3-D and, amazingly, the 3-D glasses included in the box set work well in demonstrating the 3-D effect.

After Shemp died of a heart attack in 1955, Joe Besser became the third Stooge, and remained with Moe and Larry until Columbia stopped releasing short subjects.  Again, I was impressed with Joe's comedic talents in the bonus short subjects that featured him, although there was a lot of recycled footage in them.  Even so, Joe had the unenviable task of following Curly and Shemp, and he could never reach the comedic heights that they attained.  The four short subjects featuring Joe DeRita were less than impressive, although I would give him an ""A"" for effort.  Later known as Curly Joe, he was literally along for the ride, with Moe and Larry, in  1959's feature film ""Have Rocket, Will Travel,"" which is also included in this box set.  The Three Stooges were showing their age by the time this movie was released.  The feature films they made after that are pleasant, and provide many chuckles.  However, it's their short subjects, beautifully restored in this box set, that will go down in history as the Three Stooges' comedic legacy.  Every fan of the Three Stooges should have this box set in their collection.",1384473600,6,2277,4.822164948453608

The quality is 'good' the reason for the 4 STAR instead of 5 STAR rating.  The quality is not digitally enhanced like some of the 'older' movies and tv series that gives us a reason to purchase them (usually they are far better viewing then the original movie screen or tv) but unfortunately the producers didn't take the time to 'upgrade' to digital format, BUT... they have better resolution then the seen on any tv program.

5025499,5,B006WN5W5M,"I had always wanted to start collecting Three Stooges material ever since I started collecting movies. However previous attempts to put the material out there has been a mixed bag and by bag I mean a trash bag. It's sad when my memories of watching them on a 13"" black and white tv is more vivid than a video tape or DVD. So I ended up holding off starting any kind of collection until they got their act together. And we'll they started releasing the chronological sets and from the previews I knew this was the direction I was waiting for unfortunately I wanted the price to go down as I didn't know how many volumes there would be and well they were a bit high starting out. Also I was worried that they would have a collector's set with a bonus you can't get elsewhere. Similar to movie franchises coming out with collector's sets or cool packAging once the last volume comes out after I've already bought them loyally volume to volume. In both counts the wait was worth it.

One the price is great. Buying the individual sets (without adding shipping) is considerably more.  Almost $40. Here you get all 8 volumes and the three disc bonus DVD for a great savings. I love it when more costs less. Two, having all these boxed together offers another option for display or storage. The slip case could be thicker/harder but it dies what it needs to do and it has some cool graphics.

After seeing how great the twilight zone and the original star trek series looks on blu ray I am always in awe of how well shows/movies with a huge fan base can be stored and then restored this set looks and sounds great. It has a great picture. I thought twilight looked awesome considering its age. Now go back another 20 or more years I wasn't expecting that level of clarity or quality. But that's just what I got. Now I am a huge fan, and remember watching these shots/movies on the weekend. It never seemed to get old. Well nit until curly Joe stepped in (no one could replace curly Howard though shrimp was likable) but enough being a big fan I do not know about the history and how many shorts they had altogether as I only saw the reruns. So I have no clue if anything has been left out. All I do know is you get an awful lot, way more than your money's worth so I can't complain. I can't imagine them missing anything though. The animated stooges is the only thing missing but you can find a complete set here as well. This is the complete live action stuff. There is so much in this set probably more than I need but I will watch all of it to get more of a historical and contextual perspective. If you only liked the Larry Moe and curly stuff I suggest you buy them individual volumes as they tell u on the box who is in each volume. But the investment of a few more dollars will get you So much mire bang for your buck that I'm sure you'll find things to love to make up for a few more dollars. Only negative is there really are no extras. I an grateful for the quality and quantity that I won't complain about the lack of features but a retrospective documentary would have been nice. I'm surprised this wasn't on blu ray. It would have been great to have that format for future generations. Most collector's prefer it and the quality would have shown brightly in high Dec. If they do release this on blu ray I'll definitely upgrade. That should tell you just how impressed I am with this set. So in closing let me just say wow!!!! It's a fine way to end as well",1380499200,2,3462,4.282442748091603

All the shorts are here in their original format, and I've never seen them in such good picture quality.

I been a lifelong Stooge fan. back in the early 2000's the studio released alot of stand alone Stooges DVD's, often for $20 that had about 6 short films, I bought almost all the releases. Then around 2006 they started releasing the Volume sets and I bought ALL of those, most were around $25 at the time of release, now after all that S^&T the studio takes those volumes and loads them into a single box set and throws in a extra DVD of rarities and sells it all for $60!

I did the only thing I could think of and sell my 8 sets to buy the Ultimate cause the treasure alone sells for $25 . I broke even on selling all 8 to get my Ultimate . I guess I'm happy but I originally spent almost $150 buying them one by one . Anyone got any grips about that ? I'm sure I was not the only one , And the biggest question of all .

So when I started watching the DVDs from this set, I could not believe how crisp and detailed these remastered films are. I have never seen the shorts look so pristine, so it takes a bit of getting used to! The sound is wonderful, and I feel like I'm viewing them as what they looked like back in the 1930s-50s. I haven't seen a number of the shorts with Shemp, so this collection is a real treat, because it is complete, with all of his episodes. Also, I have never seen any with Joe Besser or Joe DeRita, so I'm thrilled to have their episodes in this collection as well.

There's been 4 generations of my family that love the Stooges, including my 5-year-old son, who can't stop laughing when he watches the Stooges. And he's able to see them in all their beautifully-restored glory.

You won't be sorry buying this set; don't bother with other cheaper sets (i.e.--The Three Stooges Collectors Edition 7 DVD Set), because those are unrestored copies.

5025609,5,B006WN5W5M,"I was really hoping that ""The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection"" would meet my expectations based on its title. Alas, it did not...it went so far beyond what I hoped for that I'm STILL trying to get my head around it. My 8-year-old daughter had recently discovered the Stooges' reruns on various cable channels, but sadly there were too many versions cut down into ""minisodes,"" which is essentially a highlight reel. The quality of the FULL episodes is great and we've been watching them in chronological order. It's so much fun to watch the first couple of years when there was obviously a larger budget and everything was really fresh, until Columbia decided to recycle previously used footage to create new shorts (not the fault of the Stooges!) One lesson learned from watching the progression is that the studio heads of the day weren't always playing with a full deck.

Some of the more interesting items were the bonus disc, in which we can see Shemp, Joe De Rita and (*gulp*) Joe Besser in non-Stooge shorts (one of Shemp's features a VERY young Noah Beery, Jr., many years before ""The Rockford Files."") Another is the 3D versions of ""Spooks"" and ""Pardon My Backfire."" Mind you, this is 1950's 3D, and it comes with 2 pairs of the old style red & green 3D glasses, so don't expect the ""Avatar"" experience. Nonetheless it's fun and interesting to see (the 2D versions are also included which are easier on the eyes but senseless for the deliberate in-your-face gags).

All in all, I and my daughter are in Stooge heaven. As a side note, after watching theses full episodes back-to-back (to back to back to back), I have also realized how much I under valued Larry Fine and especially Shemp Howard when I was growing up. If en episode had Shemp, that means it didn't have Curly and automatically was not as good (in mu child's mind). I have a whole new appreciation for them as a result of this DVD set. Still could have done without Besser though...

I highly recommend this to anyone who did, may have, did but didn't realize of thought that they may have been a Stooges fan. I gave it a 5-star rating only because Amazon wouldn't allow me to give it 6.",1350691200,11,2166,4.606217616580311

5025612,2,B006WN5W5M,"......because 'TREASURES' is pushing it a bit.  This review is limited to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges-Rare-Treasures-from-the-Columbia-Vault/dp/B00895CC90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges - Rare Treasures from the Columbia Vault</a>&nbsp;3DVD bonus set that comes with this collection.  The eight individual sets that compromise the complete ""THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION"" rate 5 stars and have been reviewed thoroughly by others.

The first DVD is compromised of two feature films starring the boys, and three color cartoons whose tenuous addition has been justified by brief (and I mean brief as in seconds) appearances of cartoon versions of The Three Stooges.  The first film, ""ROCKIN' IN THE ROCKIES"" (with Curly) has Moe as a separate character, with Larry and Curly as two bumblers whose characters barely make sense in the plot except for lame comic relief. The only redeeming factor is musical appearances by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-HOOSIER-HOT-SHOTS/dp/B00009AEVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE HOOSIER HOT SHOTS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SPADE-COOLEY-HIS-ORCHESTRA/dp/B001BHUZRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SPADE COOLEY & HIS ORCHESTRA</a>.

He died of a heart attack in prison, just before the warden had a chance to tell him that he'd been pardoned by then Gov. Ronald Reagen!  Their one song is blazzin' and the steel guitarist is amazin' (sorry)! The second film, ""HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL"" (with Curly Joe) is more of a children's film, with a sorry-ass unicorn, a giant fire-breathing Venusian tarantula and an all-knowing computer that would make Robbie The Robot loose his oil!  A few recycled routines are used, the Stooges whip up a batch of rocket fuel, like the youth formula they made in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubble-Trouble/dp/B001OXLGKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Bubble Trouble""</a>, and the movie ends with the boys mingling with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoi-Polloi/dp/B00151QYYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Hoi Polloi""</a>.  The only interesting cartoon is the beautifully colored ""Bon Bon Parade,"" one of those unintentionally psychedelic ""inanimate objects come to life"" concoctions.

DVD #2 contains fourteen Columbia Comedy Shorts with Shemp Howard, five in a supporting role, and nine as the star.  Of the first five, there are three starring Andy Clyde, who started with Mack Sennett and was hired by Columbia Producer Jules White in 1934.  He made numerous shorts all the way to 1956. He was the longest standing comedian under contract to Columbia after the Stooges.  He later co-starred in the first ""rural comedy"" hit TV show ""The Real McCoy's"" with Walter Brennan.  They're good for a chuckle or two, and Clyde was a subtler actor than most in the Columbia comedy stable.  The other two were from the ""Glove Slingers"" series, with one starring Noah Beery, Jr.  Considering that many of the writers, producers, directors, etc. also worked with the Stooges it's not surprising to catch the recycled bit or two, as in ""Pleased To Mitt You,"" when an oven mitt becomes part of an iced cake.  The best Shorts starring Shemp are ""Pick A Peck Of Plumbers,"" ""Open Season For Saps"" and ""Where The Pest Begins.""  In ""Plumbers"" Shemp, along with Swede comic El Brendel, are offered $100 to find a missing diamond ring lost in the bathroom sink drain.  Although obviously inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Plumbing-We-Will-Go/dp/B00151QYYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""A Plumbing We Will Go""</a>, the mayhem that ensues actually seems funnier.  In ""Open Season"" Shemp (with a moustache!), as Woodcock Throckmorton (slipped by the censors there!) has marital troubles caused by his membership in the ""Hoot Owls;"" so he takes wifey on a vacation and gets involved in the old ""wife and woman with a jealous husband mix-up"" plot. The surprise ending though, is well...a hoot! ""Pest"" has know-it-all Shemp either almost killing co-star Tom Kennedy, or giving him a nervous breakdown with his ""help.""  Many of the supporting players in the Stooges Shorts are featured throughout Discs 2 and 3, Christine McIntyre, Vernon Dent, Emil Sitka, Bud Jameson and Joe Palma, to name a few.  There are also quite a few lousy remakes of Three Stooges classics, with Shemp ""Punch Drunk"" when listening to ""Pop Goes The Weasel,"" or as an exterminator mistaken for a professional escort.  And there's WAY too many jealous wife/husband plots.

Disc #3 has ten Comedy shorts starring Joe Besser, and four starring Joe DeRita.  The best Besser Short is ""Waiting In The Lurch,"" where he plays a wealthy eccentric ""fire chaser,"" complete with butler, firefighter gear and a fire pole in his study reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BATMAN/dp/B001RXB49K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BATMAN</a>!  Late on his way to marry Christine McIntyre (there MUST be something wrong with him!) due to a fire, her father (Vernon Dent) tries to scuttle their romance, and hilarity ensues.  Sorry to say, it's all downhill from there.  After watching the first five Besser Shorts, the rest made me question my memory, until I realized that all of the five later Shorts were remakes of the first five, ala the recycled Shemp Shorts the Stooges made!  With only new intros and outros, the only redeeming factor is that Shorts six to ten are in 1.85:1 Amamorphic Widescreen.  The DeRita Shorts are very disappointing.  Except for the thankfully upbeat closer, ""Jitter Bughouse,"" you're overwhelmed with mediocrity.

Packaged in one of those horrible snap cases that have all three DVD's on one spindle (that I first encountered in Columbia/Sony's 3DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HAMMER-FILMS-The-Icons-of-Suspense-Collection/dp/B0034PWPHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HAMMER FILMS: The Icons of Suspense Collection</a>), and with NO plot summations whatsoever like those on the back of all The THREE STOOGES COLLECTION's DVD cases, this set is sad indeed.  While the films and shorts themselves have been beautifully remastered with nary a speck of damage, the content explains why it's been unreleased until now, to be used as a tool to separate Stooge's fans from their hard earned cash.  While this set might be a boon to the collector, I would recommend the curious to hold on to their THREE STOOGES COLLECTION sets, and try to borrow this from the library, or rent it from a streaming service before committing to purchase......",1349049600,16,7363,6.1872549019607845

There are a couple of 3D versions on here (along with the non-3D as well).  For the old blue/red (really looks like green/magenta on these glasses), the 3D looks fairly decent!

3 bonus DVD's contain Shemp, Joe Besser, and Joe DeRita's solo shorts mostly from the 40s and 50s.  Shemp is truly hilarious in both starring shorts and supporting rolls.  This is the first time I've ever seen these.

If I have one complaint (very, very minor) is that the discs come one to a slimline case.  That's a lot of cases.  Would have rathered a deluxe 10 disc case or something to hold all of them, but trust me, I'm nitpicking.  I'll probably just buy blank 10 disc case and do it myself.

5025620,5,B006WN5W5M,"First, thanks and congrats to the people who put together this collection.  Enough has been written about the Three Stooges films that I needn't add anything here.  However, the addition of the solo shorts to this body of work merits some brief observations.

As a Shemp fan, I would have paid full freight just for the shorts and film appearances featuring him.  Previous reviews have suggested Shemp just remade Three Stooges shorts, but that is mostly an exaggeration. These shorts were put together by the same writing and directing crew as the Three Stooges shorts, so they are show-biz cousins, so to speak. A couple Shemp shorts have some similarity, and one gives writers' credit to ""Howard, Fine & Howard,"" but most are original and funny in themselves.  Until now I was unfamiliar with Shemp's appearances as ""Woodcoock Q. Strinker"" and other characters, and I found them most entertaining. Even when appearing with the likes of Andy Clyde, Shemp outshines his co-stars.  So this is a bonanza for Shemp enthusiasts.

Also included are Joe Besser's Columbia shorts, which are a major disappointment.  Besser's one-dimensional schtick gets old fast, and his entries are tired and predictable.  Worse, almost half of them are remakes of other Besser shorts in this collection.  I appreciate their inclusion for the sake of completeness, but having seen them once, I've seen them enough.

Ironically, I expected the Joe DeRita shorts to be nothing special, but found them funny and well made.  Having remembered DeRita as the fat, slow, crew-cut Curly replacement, I was pleasantly surprised to discover his youthful bearing, his engaging personality and fine comic timing in the mere four shorts included here.  Would that Columbia made more of DeRita and fewer of Besser!

5025623,5,B006WN5W5M,"Being a Three Stooges fan for over 25 years, it was most welcome when the classic shorts came in chronological sets and in a beautiful restoration.  Growing up, all the shorts were of mediocre technical quality (after all these shorts were over 50 years old at that time) and were always edited for time.  What a revelation that these shorts were super clear and vibrant, as Sony/Columbia went back to the original camera negatives to get the best quality.  It truly is like seeing them for the first time.  The bonus discs that come with this set are being seen for the first time (at least by me).  After many years of hearing about solo Shemp, Joe Besser and Joe DeRita shorts, here at last they are, and of the same restored quality of the classic 190.  This set was a super sweet deal, for over 20 discs, I paid only $44.99.  If you are a Stooges fan like myself, you will definitely love this.  You get the 190 shorts, solo Shemp, Joe Besser and Joe DeRita plus two full-length features, ""Rockin in the Rockies"" and ""Have Rocket Will Travel"".

Set (5 out of 5 stars)
Despite being the longest running comedy act in motion picture history, The Three Stooges never received the same respect that other acts and comedians did.  Part of that may be due to their type of humor since they didn't have Chaplin's sentimentality, Keaton's inventiveness, or Lloyd's precision.  The Three Stooges focused mainly on slapstick and their own brand of physical humor that involved hitting each other which seemed to divide audiences into those that thought they were hilarious and those that just didn't get it.  That lack of respect also included the studios that the Stooges worked for since they reaped the rewards from the various shorts and movies but never let the Stooges know just how valuable they really were and didn't share the wealth like they should've.  Time has been more kind to the Stooges as they've gained fans across the world and now with this complete collection, they've finally gotten the respectful treatment their legacy deserves.

The Three Stooges included Moe Howard (born Harry Horwitz, June 19, 1897 - May 4, 1975), Larry Fine (born Andrew Feinberg, October 22, 1902 - January 24, 1975), Curly Howard (born Jerome Horwitz, October 22, 1903 - January 18, 1952), Shemp Howard (born Samuel Horwitz, March 4, 1895 - November 22, 1955), Joe Besser (August 12, 1907 - March 1, 1988) and Joe ""Curly-Joe"" DeRita (born Joseph Wardell, July 12, 1909 - July 3, 1993).  Moe and his brother Shemp got their start as Ted Healy's Stooges, a vaudeville act that Larry joined three years later.  The act was successful enough that it led to a movie starring all of them called Soup to Nuts and not long after that the Stooges went off on their own.  Healy begged them to return and Moe and Larry did without Shemp who decided to continue a solo career. Shemp was replace by the younger Howard brother Jerry who would later be known as Curly and the core group of the Stooges was born.

It wouldn't be long before The Three Stooges left Healy and MGM to start making their own shorts at Columbia, starting with Woman Haters, Punch Drunks, and the Oscar nominated Men in Black in 1934.  Their great run came to an impasse in 1946 when Curly had to bow out of the group after having a stroke.  Shemp returned to replace Curly and  made 77 Stooge shorts and a feature film, Gold Raiders before his death in 1955.  Joe Besser was hired by Columbia studio chief Harry Cohn to become the third Stooge since he was already under contract. Besser was a successful comedian in his own right, but he wasn't the best fit for the Stooges since his whiny persona was grating and his contract didn't allow for much punishment to be dished out to him which goes against all of the things the Stooges stand for.  In 1957, Columbia shut down the shorts department and the Stooges were out of work and Besser decided to leave the team to take care of his wife after her heart attack.

In 1958, their fortunes took a surprising turn when their shorts were put into heavy rotation on TV where they found a new level of popularity.  ""Curly"" Joe DeRita became the sixth Stooge and they went on to more success and five more feature films - Have Rocket, Will Travel (1959); The Three Stooges Meet Hercules (1962); The Three Stooges in Orbit (1962); The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze (1963); and The Outlaws is Coming (1965).  They also continued to try their hand at television shows off and on, but that all came to an end when Larry suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1970 and later died in 1975.  Ever the trooper, Moe tried to reform the Stooges once again but he died six months after Larry and that dream died with him.  Curly Joe DeRita kept a new lineup of Stooges going until he decided to retire in 1979.  Joe Besser died in 1988 and DeRita followed him in 1993, which marked the final passing of the last of the original Stooges.  Since then, there's been movies made about them and even an new theatrical movie with a new lineup from the Farrelly brothers, so interest in the Stooges has never waned which is a good thing since these box sets wouldn't have been released otherwise.

Video (4 1/2 out of 5 stars)
These shorts look amazing as they've been remastered from the original negatives.  Most of the opening titles are windowboxed but look very sharp, while the shorts themselves are shown full frame.  These shorts look pristine with a much sharper image than in previous releases and the contrast has also been vastly improved.  There's some grain present on some of the shorts, but overall these shorts look spotless.  It's absolutely amazing how good these shorts look considering that they were filmed in the 30s.  Fans of the Stooges are going to be ecstatic when they see these shorts especially after all of the crappy previous releases.

Audio (4 out of 5 stars)
The mono audio tracks for these shorts are surprisingly excellent and free of the usual audio defects that plague older properties like this such as audio hiss, dropouts, etc.  The dialogue is crystal clear as are the many sound effects of the boys slapping, hitting, and poking each other.  This is most likely the best we are every going to get these shorts and I'm ok with that.  There's only a English track with optional closed-captioning and no other options so international fans should be aware of that.  Not that you really need to understand the dialogue to enjoy the Stooges comedy.  Their brand of physical comedy is funny no matter where you live as it knows no boundaries.

Extras (4 out of 5 stars)
This complete collection includes the eight volumes that have been previously released which includes all of the 190 Columbia shorts, two feature films, 3 cartoons that have Three Stooges cameos, and 28 shorts starring Shemp Howard, Joe Besser, Joe DeRita in some of their solo outings.  There's 11 hours of extra content included in this amazing set along with every remastered short that looks better than they ever have.  I wish that there were some commentaries on the sets or some historical featurettes like they had on the Buster Keaton sets, but these extras are pretty good anyway.

Here's what's on the three bonus discs:

The Three Stooges - Rare Treasures from the Columbia Vault

Summary (4 1/2 out of 5 stars)
The Three Stooges have been loved and celebrated for decades for a good reason - they're really funny and even with all of their cast changes, they still endured and made history.  These shorts are still hilarious and fun for the whole family (providing that they have a sense of humor).  My four year old son has just discovered the Stooges from this set and he can't get enough of them.  Sony/Columbia has done an incredible job restoring these shorts and it's great to be able to watch them in chronological order to see their rise to greatness.  Considering that each individual set costs around $14 each, this set is a steal at $45 for all eight volumes plus the three bonus discs.  While I wish this was released on Blu-ray, this DVD set marks the best and more respectful release of The Three Stooges to date and I highly recommend it!

5025629,5,B006WN5W5M,The three stooges ultimate collection is the best. The price I paid on Amazon was the cheapest anywhere around. What I like about the collection is it came with the rarities dvd. When I looked at just buying that dvd it happened to be the same price as the whole box set.,1343001600,,271,4.230769230769231
5025630,5,B006WN5W5M,I just received this item and thought it great set. It was very reasonably priced as well. Thanks again for the many laughs.,1342742400,3,124,4.434782608695652
5025631,5,B006WN5W5M,"For many of us we grew up with the Three Stooges. We watched their slapstick antics and laughed along as they went from one mess to another. These were guys who always seemed to make the wrong choices and yet survived to make yet another in another short film. Before my generation was one that grew up watching these shorts in movie theaters around the world. And for the current generation? They now have the opportunity to see the hilarious antics of these three from the start. Forget the new movie with slight imitations, get THE THREE STOOGES ULTIMATE COLLECTION and enjoy the originals as they were meant to be seen.

Fortunately Sony has been passing along packages of Three Stooges films to collectors and fans for years. They've made all of their earliest works available in packages that followed various years. Now all of those packages have been brought together into one along with some extras that haven't been available before. For the true fans this is pure Heaven.

The sets released before and included in this package feature the Stooges in various incarnations beginning with the original line up of Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard. Set one goes from the years 1934-1936, set two 1937-1939, set three 1940-1942, set four 1943-1944 and set five 1946-1948. In the midst of those final years Curly suffered a stroke and retired only to return for one more short. Brother Shemp replaced him and the stooges continued on. The next two sets featured Shemp as the third stooge from 1949-1951 and then 1952-1954. The last set in the collection features Shemp who passed away in 1955 and was then replaced with Joe Besser. It runs from 1955-1959.

The one thing in common all of the stooges had was years performing in vaudeville. It was there that they learned the art of slapstick comedy and to date there has been none better. Not only were they masters of the art, they had a certain amount of slick comedy talk as well that resulted in laughs just as much as the slapstick did. The characters they created also did well for all generations because the boys seemed like innocents. This played well with kids and the adults got the rest of the jokes. This combination of comedic elements made the stooges the funniest and perhaps longest running comedy outfit to ever be filmed.

So, since this collection contains these previously released sets why buy the new one? Because they've included things not seen before in a three disc set. The first disc features a short not included before, the feature film HAVE ROCKET WILL TRAVEL and several classic cartoons featuring caricatures of the Stooges. The second disc features Shemp Howard in various shorts he made without the other stooges. The third disc features shorts featuring the last of the new stooges, Joe Besser and Joe DeRita. If you already own the first sets, this can be purchased on its own. But if you know a Stooges fan who doesn't own the whole collection this is a fantastic opportunity.

Each of the sets runs anywhere from $12 to $14 dollars but this ultimate collection is currently going for just $64.59 on Amazon.com. That makes the price much less than they were on their own and they come in a box that shows the original Stooges on the cover. More amazing than that though is to think of how much you actually get for the small amount you pay. Over 3,876 minutes of footage! Over 64 hours!

There are so many worried adults out there who fear that their children seeing things like this will warp or scar them. They've taken the fun out of being a kid. Tom and Jerry are banned because of the violence. The same holds true for the Stooges with their eye pokes and slaps. The thing is that in all the years I've watched the Stooges I can't recall ever hearing of anyone losing an eye or being beaten up because someone watched them. The only thing I've ever associated them with is laughter. Perhaps its time we lightened up just a little bit. Perhaps its time we let kids be kids and get a laugh out of the same things we did growing up. If you enjoyed the Stooges as much as I did as a child then you'll want to share this with your kids today.

There is no way to pick a favorite Stooge short. I find it impossible. I've watched samples from each set and laughed at each one. In some ways they seem a little more stupid than I remember but then I laugh anyway. I appreciate Shemp Howard more than I did when I was younger. Besser and DeRita are still the weakest Stooges. And Curly reigns supreme when it comes to laughs. But the antics of Larry and Moe can be better realized when watching too. Trying to talk about them all is like swirling around in a circle, trying to give each one the credit they deserve and being unable to do each justice. The fact remains that the Stooges as a whole are one of the most amazing and funny comedy acts there ever were.

I'm hoping that the few words I've offered here do the Three Stooges justice but I doubt it. So do this. Travel back in time to when you were young and when you'd watch TV, those days when there were only 3 or 4 stations. Remember how much you laughed while watching the Three Stooges. Now take the time and make the effort to do so once again. Sony has a home run here with this ultimate collection. For movie fans this is something worth adding to your collection and putting on the watch-now-and-then shelf. This is comedy at its best.",1342569600,2,5398,4.5179119754350054
5025632,5,B006WN5W5M,"It has been interesting watching the Three Stooges short features in chronological order.  Having last seen these short features as a child and now watching them as an adult, I can better appreciate the story lines which took place during the depression (always looking for work) and during the build up to WWII (the Nazi satire).  Then, because of the short feature production cuts which took place at Columbia pictures during the war, I better understand the difference in production quality during the Curly years vs the Shemp years (location filming vs sound stage filming)...maybe the Shemp short features were not so bad after all...they were just produced in a different manner.  Thanks to Sony for making this available as a collection.",1342483200,,744,5.081967213114754
5025633,5,B006WN5W5M,"Let me start off by recognizing the angst that some fans have who have already purchased the individual volumes and want the bonus material without having to rebuy what they already own.

I am one of those individuals. However to berate SONY for repackaging the previously released 17 dvds, adding 3 dvds or rarely seen solo shorts, cartoons and feature films and reducing the price is actually in my eyes commendable.

Sony is hardly the first to do this...Warner Bros was selling 6 volumes of the LOONEY TUNES ""GOLDEN COLLECTION"" for $64.98 per volume. Last year all 6 volumes were repackaged and sold for under $100.00. This is a common practice and most TV sitcoms and anthologies are usually upon completion of release repackaged. If you're patient you can get some great deals.

When I look back at the anticipation that I had when each individual volume of the STOOGES was released and all the laughs I've had watching them I hardly feel cheated.

When AMAZON dropped the price of this set to $44.99 I repurchased it. I will resell the unopened volumes 1-8, make all my money back, maybe even turn a small profit and the bonus discs and storage box will have cost me nothing.

As far as the actual product goes all 190 shorts are in chronological order, uncut, with a beautiful clear picture and clear audio. The original 190 shorts DO NOT have SUBTITLES but are closed captioned. All of the bonus material, including the cartoons do have subtitles.

The SOLO shorts are well worth having. You'll see familiars such as Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre, Emil Sitka that were staples in the Stooges shorts. Although Joe Besser never seemed truly to fit in with the Stooges, his solo shorts are actually pretty funny.

To put it all in perspective I remember buying my first THREE STOOGES 'BETA' tape when video tape first came out. I paid $39.99 for 3 shorts. Here you can get the whole catalog for literally pennies per short.

Even if you have to pay the full price of app. $95.00 this set is one of the best DVD bargains out there.

The laughs will last you a lifetime!",1342224000,13,2076,4.6502732240437155
5025634,5,B006WN5W5M,"I am truly impressed with the video quality on these DVDs.  The images are so crystal clear compared to what I'm used to seeing on TV reruns that it's like I'm viewing them for the first time again.  Whether that's due to the masterful film restoration or the DVD upconversion feature of my Blu-Ray player, or a combination of the two, I don't know; but it is truly a pleasure to watch these classics in this format.  There is one short in particular where this is most apparent: ""Back to the Woods"" (Vol 2), where the boys are convicted of a crime in merry Olde England and sentenced to defend the new colonies in America from Indian attack.  Whenever I see this short on TV, it is always low quality... scratches, dull blurry images, decrepid sound, etc.  On this DVD set, it's like it was just released fresh for the first time.  As I said, truly impressive quality.

I *REALLY* like the fact that all these shorts are unedited.  We get to watch them uninterrupted from start to finish, without any missing scenes in the name of political correctness or due to squeezing in as much advertising air time as possible.  You get the whole story, and can have a better appreciation for the subtle genius displayed in many of the episodes.

If there was one criticism I could make, it's that not all of their full-length movies are included in the set; but honestly, who cares?  The shorts are what made them legends, and you get all 190 of those.

I started out by buying Volume #4 separately as a ""feeler"" to determine if this collection was the real deal or just another cheesy ""let's get rich off the Stooges' name"" production.  Well, I enjoyed it so much that I bought the entire box set (and gave Volume 4 to my wife's nephew, a budding young Stooges fan in his own right).

A mere $50 bought me all 190 Stooges short films, including two in anaglyph 3-D (glasses provided), two Stooges feature films making their DVD debuts, and a couple of dozen short films showcasing Shemp, Joe Besser, and Joe DeRita.  Where else are you going to get all this in one package?  The picture quality is excellent, though the 3-D shorts don't work as well as they could.  This set does not include their many TV appearances, TV commercials, home movies, failed TV pilots, some miscellaneous movie roles in other people's film, or color wraparounds for their cartoon series, but most of that material is easily found and obtained on inexpensive public domain releases.  This ""Ultimate"" set provides the Stooges fans with the stuff they really want -- their classic Columbia Pictures output.  The only thing that could make it any better would be if it also included the rest of their feature films for that studio.

5025645,5,B006WN5W5M,"Kudos to Sony for releasing this set.  Hardcore Stooges fans (like me) most likely purchased the individual sets as they were released, but I still couldn't resist this box.  The original sets are presented in the same packaging as before, including the 2 sets of 3-D glasses.  If I had any gripes, it would be the packaging.  The outer box is flimsy & not really designed as a collector's box for display.  Also, the 3 bonus discs are enclosed in an Amray case, which doesn't match the packaging of the individual sets.  On top of that, the bonus discs are stacked one atop another on a single spindle!  Luckily, none of mine were scratched.  Also, to make this more of a complete set, one has to ask why they didn't include ALL of the Columbia Moe-Larry-Curley Joe features from the 50s & 60s, instead of only one.  I know that purists are not great fans of those films, but their inclusion would have really made this an ""Ultimate Collection.""

Anyway, these are minor quibbles.  This is a GREAT value, especially for those who haven't already purchased all of the individual volumes.  Although they are denying it at present, I wouldn't be surprised if Sony made the bonus discs available separately in the future.

We all know the comedy is classic, but the restoration of these films are superb.  The Stooges have never looked or sounded better.  While it's not blu ray it's a steal at $45.00.",1339459200,2,316,4.709090909090909
5025648,5,B006WN5W5M,"I've been a Three Stooges fan since I was 14 years old, but I've never owned any of their work on a home media format. I mostly watched reruns on television early in the morning, before loading up and going to school.

For a few years there, I completely forgot about them, and in a way that was a blessing because it meant I missed out buying the individual volumes released down the years, and was instead able to wait for this one-and-done box set.

I know the people who've collected the sets individually are feeling scorned by Sony because of the lack of individual release of the bonus set, but for those of us who haven't collected the sets thus far, this is an amazing collection at an amazing price. The picture quality is top notch -- especially considering the age of the material -- the sound is good, and the compression used is nice and clean.

I pre-ordered the set and ended up paying $70 for it, and today I see it's already down to $45. But even at the full MSRP, this set is more than worth the cost. If you haven't started your Three Stooges collection yet, this is the perfect place to start. And for those who have yet to get their hands on the three bonus discs, well, the price on this full set has come down enough that it's probably worth the double dip. With the price drop, you could probably sell off the original volumes and make a little profit.",1339286400,8,1377,4.329457364341085
5025649,5,B006WN5W5M,"The new boxed set contains all of the previous short-subject releases (1934-36, 1937-39, etc., in the identical shrinkwrapped packages), and the quality is superb. You can read about the individual volumes in detail on the various Amazon pages.

The big news, and the reason vintage-comedy fans will be sorely tempted to grab this new set, is the bonus volume, titled ""Rare Treasures from the Columbia Pictures Vault."" All of the ""third Stooges"" are featured here: Curly Howard (seen in one feature film), Shemp Howard (as a supporting player in five shorts, and starring in nine more), Joe Besser (in all 10 of his 1949-56 Columbia shorts), and Joe DeRita (in his four 1946-48 shorts, as well as his first Three Stooges feature).

The Curly Howard contribution is unfortunately one of the Stooges' weakest films: ROCKIN' IN THE ROCKIES, a Western-themed musical that has Moe in a character role as ""Shorty"" and Curly and Larry as a mildly amusing two-man team. Curly is in declining health here, so there isn't much sparkle. Completists will be glad to see more Curly footage, but if you like the Stooges you may shrug your shoulders at this one.

Many Stooge fans have come to appreciate the creative comedy of Shemp Howard in recent years, and this assortment won't disappointment them. It features almost every two-reeler Shemp did for Columbia before being drafted for the Stooge series. The earliest exhibits have Shemp as a boorish foil for Mack Sennett veteran Andy Clyde. HOME ON THE RAGE, MONEY SQUAWKS, and BOOBS IN THE WOODS are standard Columbia gagfests with Shemp's stream-of-consciousness ad libs contrasting nicely with Andy's subtler bits of business. There are also two Glove Slingers comedies, with Shemp among the handlers of a likable young boxer; watch Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams openly breaking up at Shemp's improvisations in PLEASED TO MITT YOU. In 1944 Columbia began starring Shemp in his own shorts, sometimes making him part of a team. He and Swedish-dialect comic El Brendel don't quite mesh in PICK A PECK OF PLUMBERS, but dumb-ox comic Tom Kennedy makes a better foil in JIGGERS, MY WIFE and SOCIETY MUGS. Fans will note a Three Stooges connection in A HIT WITH A MISS, a remake of the early Stooge comedy PUNCH DRUNKS, with Shemp as a prizefighter who goes nuts whenever he hears ""Pop Goes the Weasel""; the story is credited to ""Howard, Fine, and Howard."" By 1946 Shemp was established as a Columbia star comic: MR. NOISY (a remake of Charley Chase's THE HECKLER, even better with Shemp) and BRIDE AND GLOOM demonstrate that he could have gone on indefinitely as a solo performer.

Joe Besser's whiny, tantrum-prone character is an acquired taste best enjoyed in moderation, which may explain why he only made one or two shorts a year for Columbia. The last four shorts are low-budget remakes of the first four! Clever scripting and editing match the newly filmed scenes to the older ones, but you'll see lots of the same footage. One very novel and eye-catching diversion is that the DVD shows the later shorts in the widescreen format, and it's amazing to see how well composed the older, pre-Cinemascope footage is when intercut with the newer wide shots.

Joe DeRita was an ex-burlesque comedian playing minor roles in minor movies when Columbia signed him for a brief series in 1946. His character at that time has been aptly described by authors Ted Okuda and Ed Watz as ""the poor man's Lou Costello,"" and you'll see hard-luck Joe having slapsticky domestic problems in the usual Columbia manner. Of special interest is JITTER BUGHOUSE, teaming Joe with The Novelites, a zany musical-comedy trio seen in the concurrent Columbia feature I SURRENDER DEAR. The DVD set also includes Joe DeRita's first appearance with Moe and Larry, the 1959 kiddie-matinee feature HAVE ROCKET, WILL TRAVEL.

The frosting on the cake is a trio of color cartoons featuring caricatures of the Stooges.

Stooge fans will recognize the same familiar character players in support: Vernon Dent, Christine McIntyre, Jean Donahue (later known as Jean Willes), Bud Jamison, Philip Van Zandt, Dick Wessel, Emil Sitka, Esther Howard, Bruce Bennett, John Tyrrell, etc. Print quality across the board is fabulous. This is a little sad in a way, because these solo shorts never received as much exposure as the Three Stooges shorts and have been largely forgotten. Fortunately for us, the mere fact that they weren't handled so often means they still look like new today. Sony Pictures' Grover Crisp can take a bow for these dazzling restorations, and Mike Schlesinger deserves our thanks for making these rarities available.

The credit for the restoration goes to Grover Crisp and his outstanding crew of film preservationists.  All the shorts were preserved onto film stock and mastered onto digital formats.  This allows for the films to be projected either from 35mm film sources and digitally from DCP or DVD.

The reason these made it to home video is due to the tenacity of one individual; an executive at Sony who knows the importance of the ""solo"" shorts to the fans of the Stooges.  He has been in the industry for over thirty years, making sure that many films were saved from extinction and, for the fans, pushing hard for their exhibition in revival houses and on home screens. With this box set of 218 two reel comedies (the largest complete collection of short subjects ever released by a major distributor), we all owe a deep debt of gratitude to Michael Schlesinger for staying true to his convictions and pursuing Sony to release these vaulted gems.

So far this disc is not slated for release on its own. The question is WHY? Why must I repurchase the entire collection just to get this disc or discs?

5025656,5,B006WN5W5M,"Great to see Columbia release the entire ""canon"" of the 190 Stooge shorts in one set; it is an iconic body of work, and automatically gets the five-star rating.

Also great to see Columbia's 3-disk supplement, which will give the general public (who only know the Stooges as a team) an idea of the OTHER comedy shorts that were being churned out by Columbia during their heyday. You will see the same directors, writers AND supporting cast members that we have come to know and love through their work with the Stooges...and it's cool to see them in all of these unfamiliar efforts (three of the Shemp appearances are in films starring the wacky but sad-sack Andy Clyde, who was Columbia studio's 2nd-biggest comedy film-star after the Stooges).

HOWEVER---BE ADVISED: there's a reason that only the Stooges shorts have survived in the public consciouness for the past 80 years; for even when an excellent director like Ed Bernds, who did such great work with the Stooges, worked with Shemp as a solo comedian (or Joe DeRita), the results were....well, you'll see for yourself. The chemistry, the PACING (as you will painfully become aware) and that special Stooge magic just ISN'T there. Still, it's fascinating to see what the old studio days were all about via these relics from the past.

You will undoubtedly come away from these 3 Bonus discs with a greater appreciation of the Stooges and just HOW GOOD THEY WERE; they were a brilliantly talented team that really lit up the screen with their unique brand of insanity.
