6463958,5,B00L37J37A,"Big British TV fan here, particularly of mysteries and police procedurals; this one being set in the mid-1950s caught my eye and I'm so glad I bought it. Charming cast, good acting and the drama is nicely spaced with a touch of humor and some great music and the personal relationships of the cast make it even more compelling. Not as bloody and violent as some shows. The 5 episodes were not nearly enough and I've just ordered the 2nd season, fervently hoping there's more to come.",1419811200,15,483,4.563218390804598

6463964,5,B00L37J37A,"LOADS OF FUN! Starts out slow--good acting, well-crafted, and you can't help but root for the main character and admire the way she handles herself in a male-dominated environment. Definitely worth a watch.",1413072000,8,206,5.2727272727272725

8663547,5,B00L37J37A,"I loved this series.  The material could be uncomfortable to watch at times as the series deals with prejudices of society against females working during the 1950s especially in stereotypical male professions.  In addition, the series highlighted the injustices of our culture and world.",1459123200,,287,5.5
8663548,4,B00L37J37A,"A very good series set in 1950s England.  Women on the force were not that common and the treatment given to WPC 56 by her new team mates is not too supportive except for a female coworker and a few of the other PCs.  Her home life is difficult as well as it seems her mother`s big goal is to see her married and at home taking care of her home.  Some of her early adventures are more ironic than dramatic and yet go well in the story line.

I won`t go into the stories but will say that they are well done and show an England in the midst of change as it emerges from the forced economies and drudgeries of wartime to the less stringent times post rationing.  It is a fine social commentary on England in the 1950s and is the better for talking subjects that some might have thought only happened in the US.

I highly recommend this series for British crime followers.",1451433600,,869,4.173652694610778
