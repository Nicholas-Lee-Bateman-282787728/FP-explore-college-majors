930475,5,6304819323,"I watched this movie as a kid and always try to catch it when it is on TV.  Recently networks have not shown the film so I decided to buy a copy.  This movie is not for everyone since it is an old English film in black and white - very little violence, no special effects and almost exclusively shot on a sound stage.  The acting and story, however, are first rate.  Freddie Bartholomew was a big name in his prime and is a delight to watch in this classic film.  I highly recommend it for any film buff.",1416096000,3,504,4.05050505050505
930476,4,6304819323,"A darker look into English Public Schools than you saw in Goodbye Mr Chips!  You are watching early ""hazing"" but are spared some of the other 'necessary requirements' to being a young new boy in such a school.  However the camaraderie between the boys, and the loyalty that is put into question is a lesson we could all use reminding of...  Great classic actors",1400198400,2,361,4.609375
930477,5,6304819323,"I loved this movie as a child, and still do. Rather harsh by today's standards, I suppose, but children's lives weren't always so precious and protected. You won't see protective gear or child services. But if you grew up back in the day, as I did, you'll remember what made you the survivor that you are today.",1397174400,4,311,4.473684210526316

930481,5,6304819323,"This movie is a nice classic about a boy and his experience at Rugby boys school in England. I'm not sure but I think the settings are in the mid 1800's. The story is about the school head master and how the boys are affected with changes to remove the bad elements in the school. This movie is based on a true story when Tom Arnold was the head master. This a very good movie with good acting, good plot, etc... I would reccommend to anyone who enjoys good, clean movies.",1365897600,,472,4.197802197802198

930484,4,6304819323,"This old movie is a terrific movie.  Great acting, good subject.  The film reproduction left a tiny something to be desired - not always clear - however most of the time it was clear. It was occasionally hard to hear unless I turned the sound up loud.  However, this often happens with old reproduced movies, it can't be helped.  I would say generally I was very pleased with the movie, good quality & a movie to be enjoyed.",1346889600,2,424,4.397435897435898
930568,5,6304819323,"TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS is a superb period drama based on a famous children's book that was beloved for ages but, in America at least, is among several once venerable children's novels to have fallen into obscurity (obviously less so in England, where the story is set as there have been three subsequent film adaptations, a major film release in 1951, an acclaimed 1971 PBS mini-series that was also popular in America, and most recently a 2005 television version that seems to have stripped away the wholesome nostalgia of the book for more of a study of juvenile bullying and brutality.) Cedric Hardwicke is a teacher in England (Thomas Arnold, a real person although the story is fictional) who revolutionizes education in the U.K. with his stringent rules for student behaviour.  He is hired as headmaster of Rugby but his frequent expulsions of problematic students have caused an uproar and threaten to have him removed but only through the support of the man who offered him the position, Thomas Brown, is he able to stay on.

Brown's own son ultimately becomes a student on the campus and the bulk of the story follows his adventures there from his attempts to win friends to being bullied by older students.  When Tom is unjustly accused of ""telling tales"" (tattling) on one bully which results in the hoodlum's suspension, Tom is ostracized by one and all including his closest friends.  Apparently his contemporaries prefer a harassing bully to a tattle-tale!

This movie was probably produced to capitalize on the huge success of the previous year's GOODBYE MR CHIPS, written by James Hilton yet undoubtably Hilton's tale was in part inspired by Thomas Hughes' 19th century novel.  I personally found this movie a much more enjoyable film with it's emphasis on the students rather than the teachers and the delightful bits of comedy showing boys will be boys regardless of the era or century.

James Lydon is excellent in the title role as the virtuous but down-to-earth Tom; Lydon went on to star in a popular B movie series as Henry Aldrich but it's hard to see many of his movies today.  His best friend is played by Freddie Bartholmeow, Hollywood's golden boy child star just a few years earlier but now in a very secondary part despite his top billing.  Billy Halop of Dead End Kids fame is very good as the bully Flagstone and Cedric Hardwicke superb as the schoolmaster whose rules and standards do seem rather severe at times (students are expelled if caught lying and receive little mercy or sympathy, even if threatening to kill themselves over the shame!) It's also fun to see Polly Moran in a rare role in the late 1930's as the earthy owner of an apparent 19th century snack bar that seems to offer little beyond baked potatoes (called ""Murphy's"").  Lovely young Gale Storm makes her film debut as Moran's niece.

This movie sadly has little reputation but I found it one of the most appealing period pieces from the golden age of Hollywood, very well acted and directed.",1289520000,9,2996,4.820662768031189

930571,4,6304819323,"If you liked Boys Town and Goodbye, Mr. Chips, you'll enjoy Tom Brown's School Days. Rugby is a boarding school in England where Dr. Thomas Arnold (Cedric Hardwicke) has reformed the goings on. His hard work has paid off and has helped the attending boys to learn integrity and confidence. Some boys have gained too much confidence, and bullies like Flashman (Billy Halop) have begun to cause problems. Tom Brown (Jimmy Lydon) is new at the school; his father went to Rugby when he was young too. Tom relies on East (Freddie Bartholomew) as his mentor, but cannot escape Flashman's reign. The code at the school is to tell no tales, or in other words not to rat on each other. This makes it difficult for Tom to have friends and to enjoy the school.

The cast is really exciting to see. Lydon is appropriately naive and sweet in his part, a character to sympathize with. Halop is best known for his stint with the Dead End Kids as a tough kid from the streets. Fellow Dead End star Leo Gorcey once commented that Halop was the most talented kid in the group. Also featured here is an adolescent Bartholomew. He is just as good an actor as ever, but as many child stars experience, his career was on the decline. It is fortunate that we have a rare glimpse into his later life with this film.",1192060800,8,1291,4.447257383966245

930573,3,6304819323,"A coming of age movie. It reminds me of growing up and the right of passage all young men go through.

I still like ""The Happy Years"" the best, but I have been unable to find this movie. You sent to me what I thought was The Happy Years in a three DVD set, but I was disappointed to learn it was not one of the three.",1185926400,,317,3.7313432835820897
930574,5,6304819323,"Based upon true persons and the true experiences of the author. An exciting story of life at a boy's boarding school in England in the early 1830's. Shows the many adventures of new student Tom Brown with only a few minutes in the classroom. The real life headmaster of the school, Dr. Thomas Arnold, and his challenge to motivate the boys; ""if they wish to govern others, they must first learn to govern themselves."" A very lively story of friendship, with humor, adventure, and clever boyhood mischief. The bully, the Flashman, is well played, as are the many charming supporting characters.

The 1973 version is good, but lacks the great charm and lively pace of this 1940 version. However, the 1973 version has an almost completely different story; so if you have seen one; you can watch the other without repeating yourself.

There is either a sequel or this copy cut part of the story. I saw other scenes on television with the same actors. This version had at least one sentence cut. Amazon should put the sequel or the full length on DVD, and restore it (not remaster, not lighten and wash out). There is also a different 1951 version.

The 1951 version has no humor. It is not half as good as the 1940 version, but the story is different, holds your interest, and is worthwhile; though actor Robert Newton playing the doctor still looks like the pirate Long John Silver to me in the 1951 version.",1169164800,14,1405,4.634538152610442

930576,3,6304819323,I ordered this title and received a home made copy on DVD (copied from a VHS) instead of the original as released by Gotham. Be careful.,1123804800,8,136,4.269230769230769
930577,4,6304819323,"This work is primarily occupied with major incidents in the life of Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby, and his overcoming of a good deal of resistance in lifting that institution from a tepid state to a position of England's finest public school. The strong direction is by Robert Stevenson, who also contributed mightily to the script, which is rather faithfully based upon the novel of the same name by Thomas Hughes, and which employs the student Tom Brown as Arnold's tactical and ethical surrogate within the scholastic body. Arnold, who must find an answer to the prevalent bullying of the day, is portrayed by Sir Cedric Hardwicke with a stunning performance, ably supported by Josephine Hutchinson as Mrs. Arnold. The film proceeds at a very crisp pace, with the scenario building well as Brown, played with feeling by Jimmy Lydon, prepares to make a stand against older and tyrannical students led by Billy Halop as Flashman. The arteries of the novel are presented with some depth, demonstrating the inculcation into the students of the importance of physical and mental courage, loyalty, and self-reliance, albeit apparently at the cost of some amount of intellectual achievement. The love of the students for Rugby and for their headmaster is presented throughout, the production design, costumes, and editing are all first-rate, and a superb musical score is contributed by Anthony Collins.",1108339200,3,1404,5.18942731277533
