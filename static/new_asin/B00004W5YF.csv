As a former translator of Japanese - self taught in the United States before moving to Kyoto to do it the only real and right way, I can tell you this is useless.  It just seems good because there's so little to compare it to.",1407715200,,314,4.305084745762712
7924937,2,B00004W5YF,"With American settings, food, housing, people, kids, clothing, kitchens and the ""Japanese"" in English, this is better suited for people wanting to learn English.  International Baby 101 is the real thing.",1112140800,4,204,5.580645161290323
7924938,5,B00004W5YF,"Since my husband is 1/2 Japanese we really wanted our daughters to learn both the languages of their heritage, especially since my husband regrets that he didn't. Imagine my excitment at finding Bilingual Baby Japanese! It is more than the 30 minutes minimum, and total immersion for that 30 minutes plus, that experts recommend-plus it visually holds their attention. I really like the fact that they take the words used and then put them into a sentence. I am also pleased to say that I have learned alot of Japanese too!!",1044316800,,524,4.769230769230769
7924939,1,B00004W5YF,"I'm sorry, but this video just didn't hold my daughter's interest.  The women who narrarated the video was boring and monotonous.  Worst of all, as a native speaker of Japanese, I was offended by the narrator's pronunciation and the obvious lack of input by native Japanese speakers into the video.",1014508800,21,298,4.94
7924940,5,B00004W5YF,"My 18mo son loves his akachan video.  The images are eye catching and appropriate, the background music is upbeat (children's songs), children of various ages and ethnic backgrounds are featured, the pace is just right (you can repeat or translate afterward), and the narrator speaks real Japanese clearly.  I like the way the video introduces words then has a practical application.  It starts out with familiar words and sentences (dog, play, ball, the dog plays with the ball).  Numbers and colors are next (one, one book, how many books?, one book).  Manners and phrases follow (please, thank you, yes, no, hello, good-bye, I love you).  Then more familiar words and sentences.  It ends with a review of everything.  The box has a script of all the words and phrases which I found very helpful.  Now I'm anxious to introduce my toddler to the other Small Fry videos.",1013126400,5,870,4.863945578231292
