8520035,5,B007OZF61C,"This movie is for people who like to think, enjoy superb acting and get into character studies, No car chase scenes and special technological effects, thankfully, but an intriguing, well-written storyline. Dunaway is a master, more talented than Streep. In the role of Lou, she is a spent former Super Model whose career has waned, and she must face all of life's realities. She does have a mere handful of people who still care about her, including the Roy Scheider character. Scheider is another actor who was underrated.  I can't wait to see this again.
Does anyone know if there are versions other than the French?",1467417600,,618,4.830188679245283

8520037,4,B007OZF61C,"First of all, I like Faye Dunaway a lot.  And Barry Morse (Space 1999, The Fugitive), has a small part in this too.  So, I was already predisposed to like it.

The director (? or producer) was a fashion photographer; and that really affected the way this film looks.  I think it is a very positive effect.  But if you prefer a more direct feel in films; the mood set in this one might not be your cup of tea.

Kind of surreal in some ways.  Unusual.  I will probably be able to watch it over and over and find something new in it each time.  It is basically about the sexual dysfunction and emotional problems of a has-been fashion model.  That might sound kind of limited.  But like I said, this is kind of an ""artsy"" movie; so the storyline doesn't tell the whole story.",1393804800,3,772,4.219178082191781
8520038,4,B007OZF61C,"Slowly recovering from a complete nervous and mental breakdown, a once famous high fashion model (Faye Dunaway) recounts her life story for an ex-lover (Barry Primus) who is planning a film on her life. Inspired by the life of model Anne St. Marie, a prominent model of the 1950s, director Jerry Schatzberg (PANIC IN NEEDLE PARK) delivers an meticulous portrait of a woman gradually spiraling into a descent to insanity. That the film is clearly self indulgent and often ponderous does not detract from the film's honest and accurate core. Schatzberg started out as a fashion photographer so he clearly knows the milieu and anyone who has worked with the mentally ill can recognize the precise details of Dunaway's performance, who thankfully doesn't overplay her hand. There's a wonderful yet subtly shocking moment when we realize that Dunaway's character, who we've thought as quirky and eccentric is stark raving made! The film is fragmented and it's difficult to gauge Dunaway's history because it contradicts itself in a morass of fantasies, outright lies and Freudian truths. But Dunaway at this stage of her career was not only at the height of her creative powers as an actress but she's never been more of movie goddess too. A failure perhaps but in many ways more fascinating than the less ambitious successes. Written by Carole Eastman (FIVE EASY PIECES). The low keyed underscore is by Michael Small, the cinematography by Adam Holender (MIDNIGHT COWBOY). With Roy Scheider, Viveca Lindfors, Barry Morse and Barbara Carrera.

The Carlotta DVD from France is an excellent anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer that includes a nice retrospective interview with director Jerry Schatzberg.",1334361600,5,1699,5.200729927007299
