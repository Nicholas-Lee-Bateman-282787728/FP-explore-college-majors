8343140,4,B000QJMDFA,"There are some who look at the Mexican revolution (1910-1920) as this dramatic and chivalrous moment in Mexican history which would bring land and ""libertad"" to the neglected masses.  In reality the  revolution  destroyed families, led to the death of thousands and in the  end changed very little as the heroes of the revolution didn't live to see  their dream become reality.  In ""La Cucaracha"", we experience the  revolution from the eyes of Colonel Zeta (Emilio India Fernandez at his  machista best), Isabel (Dolores del Rio), a widow who's professor husband  is forced into service and La Cucaracha (Maria Felix), a soldadera who  portrays one of the strongest female leads in a Mexican movie.
In Zeta we  have perhaps one of the more powerful male figure trying desperately to  keep the revolution going eventhough he has lost most of his men and people  have lost interest in fighting. His demeanor is such that strikes fear into  men.  Zeta in turn is matched up against Maria Felix who is as his female  counterpart, is a patriot to the revolution and to whom men hold allegiance  to.  A love triangle ensues between the two and Isabel.  Midway through the  movie we see that Zeta isn't really the brute that he has to be. The  direction is swift, with some memorable battle conversation surrounding the  merits of war.  The music is of special note, with revolutionary ballads  performed on camera by Cuco Sanchez and others. In a cameo performance  there is a memorable performance by Pedro Armendariz.  His cantina  conversation with Zeta is a classic testosterone machista contra machista.  Also appearing is Antonio Aguilar in one of his first roles as a young  Capitan under General Carranza.  During a dramatic moment he must chose his  loyalty between Villa and Carranza.  One interesting note, is that the  director has chosen not to feature Villa at all.  Although his presence is  felt throughout the movie.  Powerful peformances throughout, a must for  fanatics of the above stars.  The version I saw was not subtitled.  There  are so many good Mexican movies that aren't seen because of this.  A loss  too many.",954979200,14,2134,4.895774647887324
