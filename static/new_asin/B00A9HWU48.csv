5401657,2,B00A9HWU48,"Doesn't even compare to ""Lots and Lots of Firetrucks"". My kids wore that DVD out so I thought they'd love this one. VERY different format, doesn't teach the kids anything at all about the sport. Very disappointing. Watch youtube instead.",1428537600,,237,4.95

5401665,1,B00A9HWU48,Horrible graphics and videography. Waste of money.,1407024000,,50,6.285714285714286

5401669,2,B00A9HWU48,"just be prepared for trucks driving around, no breaks talking about the trucks.  boring for my son and not very interested in the movie.",1395532800,,136,4.666666666666667

8548725,2,B00A9HWU48,My 3year old grandson likes it .,1529366400,,32,3.7142857142857144
8548726,5,B00A9HWU48,great movie,1518393600,,11,5.0

8548728,5,B00A9HWU48,exactly and perfect,1493337600,,19,5.666666666666667
8548729,2,B00A9HWU48,"This is pretty low quality filming. If it's for a 1-2 year old they won't care, but having to watch it along with him is tough. Much better to watch an official Monster Jam video.",1484697600,,179,4.142857142857143
8548730,1,B00A9HWU48,"The first 15 minutes is all monster trucks, then it breaks down into a collection of RC toys, motocross, quads, rocket quads, kids carts, hydraulic monster, etc.  Less than 30 minutes is monster trucks.  Misleading.  Disappointing to a little boy who wanted to see monster trucks. ""Lots and lots of monster trucks"" should be titled ""lots of stuff you will see at a monster truck rally"".  Why don't you just sell what you advertise.",1484697600,,431,4.783783783783784
8548731,4,B00A9HWU48,"My son loves this. I find there to be a lot of advertising at the end if you hit ""play all"" option. Kind of annoying. But a kid who loves monster trucks will love this.",1480809600,,168,3.8285714285714287
8548732,2,B00A9HWU48,"My son is 2 and was happy with it but i was dissapointed. The movie only shows video clips and half of it isn't about monster trucks (four wheels,dirtbikes and some dragon machine that eats cars)",1477353600,,195,4.444444444444445
8548733,1,B00A9HWU48,Poor quality. It plays background music the entire time so you can bearly hear the actual sound of the trucks. Lots of slow motion too. My 3 year old was bord after 10 min. Very disappointing.,1470355200,,192,4.361111111111111
8548734,4,B00A9HWU48,My grandson loved it,1468108800,,20,4.25
