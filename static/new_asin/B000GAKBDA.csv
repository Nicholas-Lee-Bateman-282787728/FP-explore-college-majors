2602888,5,B000GAKBDA,This is a great dvd. The mechanics and scrappers they found for this movie are funny and interesting. If you like old school and rat rods this movie is for you.,1228089600,2,160,4.193548387096774
2602889,5,B000GAKBDA,"This dvd is great. The soundtrack music alone will you have you tapping your foot to the beat. A very well done film about rat rods and hotrods. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who loves hot rods, rat rods or cars in general. Watching the work that Ian does on the rod he builds has been a great insperation to me on the work I have done on my 40 mercury.",1226793600,3,363,3.9863013698630136
2602890,1,B000GAKBDA,"Not that great other than seeing Scratch pinstripe.  Ian is a different character in an artsy way and does not seem to build with practical knowledge.  If we built stuff like he did and had it inspected for legal street use we would be denied the ability to drive it on public roads.  He also destroys a very rare windshield which was kind of hard to see...but hey, it's art.",1213228800,,375,4.328571428571428
2602891,5,B000GAKBDA,"Got this at Walmart for $5. (sorry, Amazon) Was expecting it to be a  passably decent thrown togeather thing at best. Turns out this is a well made professional deal. Got great original music. Introduces us to people dedicated to their art. Intimate examination of the creative process. Some of these guys are true artists, with vehicles as their mode of expression. Highly recommended.",1212969600,11,386,5.03125
2602892,5,B000GAKBDA,"This  is a fantastic DVD on ""layin' it down"" when it comes to ""rats"" or hot rod insight, of what you're looking at, as far as labor intensive time, and thought. It's hard work to build from ground up like they used to do in the heyday of rodding (40's 50s &60's ), but it's creative and fun work.
In addition, this DVD has great information on pin striping, with ""SCRATCH"", who's a master at laying the lines out beautifully. Ian Rouchell the rat rod-man considers himself more of a metal artist and sculptor , than a mechanic and custom car builder . This guy is an artist alright , and an absolutely unbelievable custom rod builder.
It just blows my mind how a guy can casually go out into the streets , alleys , or local junk yards , and find what most folks would consider to be garbage, or trash, and make a MASTERPIECE out of it , or with it. This is a must have for ANY vintage car enthusiast. And for the price , go on and dig up the few bucks to get this DVD. Check it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
Now, I don't know these guys, and this is NO pitch as to help them out. All I know is I stumbled upon this DVD at WAL-MART, bought it and really enjoyed it. And the music soundtrack is great as well. Cheers !",1200268800,23,1231,4.086776859504132
2602893,5,B000GAKBDA,"I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this dvd. take advantage of the low price and BUY THIS NOW! i'm no expert on the HOT ROD scene, but this was very enjoyable. The footage of pinstripe artist SKRATCH is worth the price alone.

  I would say anyone who is into watching creative people do something artistic and original will really love this. you get to see the creative process of some great project cars, as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders and car club members. I will definitely be watching this one a few times.",1168473600,15,554,4.411764705882353

2602955,4,B000GAKBDA,"I actually enjoyed the bulk of this film, very reminiscent of the way cars got done in the old days
like the comment "" i don't have $10000. for a paint job and niether did they back then"". The black and white footage looks like it could've been shot in the 50s, Ian Rousell, more of an artist than a car guy was entertaining to watch as he goes thru the motions of creating a car not good on the tech details, the boat
windshield  he cut down was actually a modern day aftermarket piece, he said I'm building a model A when
it is actually a 26 27 Ford roadster pickup body. The other cars owned and built by regular car guys,
building them over years in some cases. The shop teacher ,Lyle Wishart, was over the top, I wish I had
a shop teacher like that when in school, he pushes his students to be creative,proactive and they seem
to have a good time !! this dvd is inexpensive, entertaining and informative.

Follows several hot rod/rat rod guys through day-to-day life as they pick, chop, and prep their rods for the Vegas hot rod show. All of them have really different but equally interesting lives and interests, and they all specialize in different aspects of kustom culture and lifestyle. Love it. At the Vegas show they all come together and show off their projects. Wish this video was longer, I was sorry it ended after only an hour. Loved it!",1333584000,,567,4.514563106796117
2602959,5,B000GAKBDA,"Hot Rods, Rat Rods & Kustom Kulture - Back From The Dead

INTRO
Back In The Day and all the way to today, how often have you worked on an old car -- or at least fantasized about it -- how many times have you heard the stories from other car crafters?

SUMMARY
With amazing quality and creativity, this DVD has it all together, from a great story line to outstanding videography, editing, automotive skills on display, and a superior sound track featuring lots of twangy-tangy guitars that all of us enjoy and that a true Rockabilly fan will love.

A project is scoped out, then cut, welded, grinded, hacked, and otherwise wrenched on for an interminable amount of time.

DETAILS
A crate engine is stuffed into it and it roars to life.

Parts come out of their storage location deep inside the cavernous form of an old General Motors Coach ""RTS"" bus painted black of course. Or is the bus an erstwhile crash pad with reasonable rates?

Day and night, the rat rod is formed. Surreal visitors stop by with parts or just to conduct an impromptu bench-racing session.

GLORY DAY
At long last, with quite a few close calls and some trepidation and fear of failure, the great American work ethic pays off and the car makes the drive to Las Vegas for the big annual rat rod and Rockabilly show.

You've just GOT to see this.
WOW.

RECOMMENDATION
Truly, it's more of an experience than a DVD to view. The colorography, sights and sounds, the ordeal of building the car -- even taking the steel toe caps out of an old, worn pair of boots to make some swifty scoops on the cowl -- the tumultuous, surf-like upside down, twisting around camera angles, leading-edge wipes, fades, and music all meld together into a fantastic, heart-tugging show that you will savor.

You will watch it again and perhaps again.

Share it with friends.",1326758400,2,1820,4.569230769230769
2602960,5,B000GAKBDA,"I thought the whole thing was great. Overall production and quality was top notch. I love the way the dvd starts with the ""Back from the Dead"" approach and the film burning up. The shop teacher is super cool and should be an inspiration to other teachers on how to educate students. He seems to really relate to the younger generation, but he is definately in charge; ie: on hearing a student complain he asks, ""wanna go bake some cakes?"".  Some reviewers were dissing on Ian Roussel. Roussel isn't ""weird"" or ""kinda gay"". He comes across like an old buddy giving you the low down on what he is doing with the build. Not one of these put on paper badass builders you see way to much of on TV today. He IS a freakin genius and a magician with metal. One of the best parts of the dvd is watching him turn a pile of parts into a full blown hot rod. Cool music, pretty girls, hot rods, Elvis shades... it's all there man.
