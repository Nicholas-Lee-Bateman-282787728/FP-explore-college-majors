3790678,4,B001TIGFEM,"I purchased this 2 pack movie selection not long ago. Alien Apocalypse has always been one of my altime favorites of Mr. Campbell and I have enjoyed watching it several times on TV and now on my own DVD. I am very happy with it. On the other hand...the Man with the Screaming Brain has been hard to watch. I have not yet gone through the whole thing so I don't think I can give a fair evaluation of the movie at this time. I start it and I get a little further with each viewing...but so far this has been disappointing to me and slightly painful to watch. However, Alien Apocalypse more than makes up for it and the cost of the set. Sorry I coudn't be more helpful!",1322179200,2,666,4.130769230769231

3790686,5,B001TIGFEM,"Looking to add to your Bruce library? Well, here you go! The best B actor on the planet has given us a 2-pack of super B movies! Don't buy these if you are thinking of Evil Dead...Bruce doesn't go there in these two films. Instead, he tries his hand at acting...no offence intended. We just can't help but love any movies Bruce makes. Sure, he's not going to win an Oscar for either of these films, but, hey, he wouldn't be Bruce if he did!",1377907200,,440,4.188235294117647
3790687,5,B001TIGFEM,How can you go wrong with actor Bruce Campbell. These are very funny as all his acting. . . .,1357257600,3,93,3.7
3790688,3,B001TIGFEM,"This is a two single sided disk package containing two of Bruce the Campbell-meister's films;The Man with the Screaming Brain(released April/05) and Alien Apocalypse(released Mar/05).The Man with the SB is the best out of the two;something that is quite inventive and full of Campbell's trademark humour. It stars Bruce Campbell as William Cole,Tamara Gorski(who had a very memorable part as Morrigan in Hercules)as Tatoya,Ted Raimi as Pavel,Antoinette Byron as Jackie Cole,Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivanov and others. The latter film,Alien Apocalypse,is what many think of when they think of Campbell and his movie credits;B-movie all the way. It's low budget cheesiness does the film in from the start. It stars Bruce Campbell as Dr. Ivan Hood,Renee O'Connor(Gabrielle in Xena)as Kelly,Peter Jason as President Demsky and others.
Man with the Screaming Brain finds Bruce as the head of a drug company visiting a town in Bulgaria. His wife Antoinette and Bruce just don't see eye to eye anymore in so far as their marriage goes. They get friendly with a local cabby who sticks with them during their time there. Antoinette gets closerthanthis with the cabbie while Bruce later gets a fatal attraction with a gypsy played by Tamara. If Tamara's affections are in any way rejected,she usually resorts to a knife into flesh. In the town a local professor played by Keach discovers a remarkable method of regenerating brain tissue using donors which will not be rejected. Ted Raimi is the professors funny sidekick. The professor sends Raimi off with a note to present to Bruce in order to get funding for the project. Bruce outright rejects it.
Bruce discovers the gypsy has absconded with a ring meant for his wife. He runs after her but in the confrontation gets whacked over the head with a pipe and is later put on life support. The cabbie sees this and he too is fatally stabbed. The professor hears about Bruce's dilemma and puts his theories to practical work on his brain. Unbeknownst to Bruce,he uses part of the cabbies brain to inject into his to regenerate the tissue. This causes Bruce to not only see things he couldn't have(the cabbies memories)but it has the effect of the cabbie's brain parts controlling Bruce's left arm,while Bruce controls the other. This amounts to an ongoing battle for domination of Bruce's brain,thoughts and actions. Meanwhile,Bruce's wife confronts the gypsy who also offs HER.She ends up in the professors lab and her brain is transplanted into a robot Raimi has been playing with for sometime. Bruce/the cabbie and his wife/robot end up hunting the gypsy down. The wife gets tossed over a bridge before Bruce can finally dispatch the gypsy. There is a tearful goodbye as Bruce's robotic wife dies in his arms. The film ends back in the States as Bruce is back home and reunited with his wife...in the gypsy's body!
This film is just chock full of gags of all sorts and at no point does the film take itself seriously. Somehow,the sequence with a tearful Bruce holding his robotic wife DOES work. It gets you right where Bruce wanted you to get it. It's a bit of a windy plot,but it is just so quirky that it works beautifully all the way. I didn't find a dull spot in it. It is something like,oh,I'd say Bubba Ho-Tep,something so odd and off beat,that it's good. Ted Raimi of course is always a delight and never fails to please. Stacey Keach also gets honourable mention. Four solid stars.
Alien Apocalypse finds Bruce and Renee as two of three astronauts in the future. They were sent into space and eventually went into hibernation for 40 years before coming back to Earth. However they come back to a world that has been taken over by large mites,looking for all the world like giant green ants. The aliens are in need of wood,which is their first delicacy. Their second is human heads. Renee and Bruce are captured and brought into a camp to work as slaves to harvest wood. The two become very close and later attempt an escape. Bruce makes it while Renee is recaptured. Bruce goes on to look for the president,who it is believed is hiding in that neck of the woods and planning an uprising. He finds him but he is more interested in painting than fighting. Bruce realizes he has to take on the burden himself and works his way back to the encampment to free Renee(his girl)and the rest of the humans there. He picks up about 25-30 people on his way and they attack with bows and arrows. They do indeed kill the resident aliens and claim the camp for their own. However more aliens arrive to retake the camp. A pitched battle takes place and just as it looks bad for the group,the president arrives with many more people to finally kill all of the aliens left. The film ends as Bruce has become legendary,as he goes from one camp to the next,killing aliens and taking back the Earth.
This film has little or no drive at all except for Campbell's bravado and forceful style. It is obvious it is low budget and that Bruce is working,for the most part,with alot of inexperienced actors. That aside though,the plot is just nothing to get excited about and poor Renee O'Connor really doesn't have a decent line in the whole film. It's up to Bruce to carry it all,and one man can only do so much. 2 1/2-3 stars.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in their w/s a/r's of 1:77:1. Extras on both include commentary,trailers,bios and featurettes.
All in all we have one good and one poor entry here.""The Man..."" is the best of the bunch,being inventive,oddball but totally enjoyable.""Alien...""is the bad apple. With a totally lame plot,old CGI and Bruce carrying everyone in the film.",1356566400,2,5628,4.749744637385087
3790689,3,B001TIGFEM,"Okay I gave three stars to both of these movies even though I personally wanted to give them four but I know most of you don't appreciate Bruce Campbell as much as I do and to give them five would not only have been over the top but means I'm gay for Bruce,which I'm not.
 The Man with the Screaming Brain takes place somewhere in Bulgaria. Bruce is a rich rude American looking to exploit the locals and make millions. Stacy Keach is the mad brilliant scientist that brings Bruce back to life after he is killed and replacing the damaged tissue with parts of an ex-KGB agent's brain who turned cab driver after the fall of Communism. How they got Stacy Keach for this movie is beyond me. Gambling debts or blackmail?
 Bruce's wife is also killed by a sexy gypsy girl when she goes looking for her missing husband even though they've had marital problems throughout the movie. My wife would have paid to have me disappear. Stacy places her brain in an android that's conveniently built by his comic henchman.
 Anyway Stacy's comic henchman is played by Ted Raimi who is always around to pick up the pieces and bring them back to the laboratory for the doctor to reanimate. You can always make a Bruce Campbell movie better if you've got Ted Raimi in it.
 Bruce the rich Capitalist brought down to picking his clothes out of a bin and the KGB agent turned taxi driver have to resolve their differences as they share the same body.

 Alien Apocalypse takes place on Earth when astronauts Bruce Campbell and his crew land forty years after a cryogenic sleep in space and find the planet inhabited by head eating termites. Humans are slaves and forced to cut lumber to ship back to the insect's home world.
 Our hero Bruce escapes the bug's prison camp and goes searching for the President and his army that is rumored among the populace to return and destroy the invaders and set them free.
 Only when Bruce finds the President and his cabinet there is no organized army, instead he finds them hiding in fear and reluctant to even venture outside. So what is a hero to do but lead the battle himself with the ragtag band he's assembled along the way.
 In this world of the future some humans are heroes and some are villains, good guys and bad. Some fight for good and some for evil. Kind of like our present Earth.
 Okay this was just a brief summary to give y'all a gist of what these two flicks were about. I'd say for the price they're worth ordering and watching. If you're on a date you might want to watch something a little more girl friendly like any of the ""EVIL DEAD"" series, they're love stories.
 This was a two disk pack and I think I got a fair deal on my purchase.
