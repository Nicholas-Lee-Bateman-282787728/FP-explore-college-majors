1622763,5,B00005LKHT,"The depictions here are the only accurate substantial accounts of Jimmy Dean's life.  There are no bios that can even scratch the surface about him.  All of them (authors) put their ideologies above the truth of who Jimmy was.  It's too bad  that the only truth about this man can never be fully told even by ""some"" who ""claim"" they knew him.  Christy White is the only one and maybe Bill Bast who appear to be faithfull to his past.  The other closest is ""maybe"" the movie made by TNT in 2003.

1622764,5,B00005LKHT,"This documentary was made right after the rebels death and success. Which is interesting because you get to hear what people who are not alive now had to say about him and see the way the world was at the time of Jimmys death and stardome. It catures the feel of the legacy he left behind. Not only that, it also includes interviews with his family and friends who are dead now along with a recording of James Dean talking with his family and a deleted scene from ""East of Eden."" Though the documentary was creepy and haunting, as its first image was, it was also heart felt.",1057104000,9,575,4.333333333333333

1622778,5,B00005LKHT,If your not a fan of James Dean then this documentary will be very boring. This goes in depth about James Dean's life. After watching this it actually made me loose a little respect for him. It just made the Dean like a self-centered brat.,1360281600,,239,4.333333333333333
1622779,3,B00005LKHT,"Certainly well worth watching for any Dean fan (as amply noted in other reviews), but the endless comments about Dean's internal feelings, ideas and intentions strains credibility and becomes t-e-d-i-o-u-s beyond belief. The sequence 22-25 minutes into the film illustrates that rather well.  One of the reasons for Dean's popularity was (and is) that he was a blank screen on which one could project their own angst (as did Altman in making the film).  Someone who gives minimal dialogue and plenty glowering or surly looks has to incite that or there's nothing.  What is amazing is that misunderstood media rebels of the mid 20th century were portrayed as if they were the only ones before or since who had suffered a tortured coming of age.  Gracious, my mother (an 86 year old) grew up in poverty during the Depression; they didn't have indoor plumbing or electricity until WWII when she was in high school, and HER mother was forced into an arranged marriage with an abusive, considerably older man who was believed to be a catch.  People like my mom and grandma had a lot more to cry about and they did it with considerable stoicism.",1338076800,2,1139,4.790816326530612
1622780,3,B00005LKHT,"There is something very appealing about a documentary that dares to psychologize its subject (if not to the point of the Self digression), because so many documentaries, these days, try to feign objectivity to the breaking point, even when, ala Michael Moore, their position- pro or con, is manifest from the get-go. Similarly, the personal accounts of Dean seem far more genuine than later documentaries in which interviewees seem to mug for the camera, and pull apocryphal tales out of their asses, just to get their own lousy fifteen minutes in the sun. The interviewees here are speaking contemporaneously, before Dean's legend really took off, and there is none of the deliberate or unintended fuzzing of memories towards the better angels of Dean's nature.

  The lone exception to this particular good quality of the film, is a scene where Altman gets the family and friends of Dean to re-enact their reactions to first hearing of Dean's death in a car crash of his Porsche on September 30th, 1955. What makes this section so poor a piece of filmmaking is the fact that earlier, we get to listen to a surreptitiously recorded `real' conversation between Dean and his relatives, and the contrast between that and the `scripted' parts is so great. Also, the film makes good use of the slow panning technique over still photographs that would later be used so successfully by documentarian Ken Burns. However, a caveat should be noted, and that is that the reason the technique works so well in the film is that the source photos are so intriguing. Yes, Dean comes off as a terminal narcissist, but he really did know how to strike the pose, and surround himself with photographer pals to immortalize himself.

  That said, the film, even at its mere 79 minutes of length, tends to wear a bit thin after the hour mark, because the reality is that Dean, despite this film's best intentions and claims, was not a particularly good actor. He was a relentless and born ham, and one need only watch Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, vis--vis Dean, to see the gulf between good and mediocre Method actors. Yet, while scenes from his films are few, there are some good passages with some of Dean's friends from New York and Los Angeles restaurants, some outtakes from films, newsreels of the opening of Giant, and a Public Service Announcement for safe driving, which more than make up for the film's deficiencies. Thus, The James Dean Story is a film and DVD worth watching, even if there are no extras, for its dated style becomes that rare quality that enhances even as it detracts. When was the last time you engaged a piece of art you could say even that of?",1283299200,2,2662,4.763557483731019
1622781,3,B00005LKHT,"Interesting look at James Dean,Although it is basically still pictures with a narrator, along with interviews of those who knew him.

1622782,5,B00005LKHT,"Perhaps the most astounding portion of ""The James Dean Story"" is the audio and still footage of the hidden recording of the Dean family talent at auctioneering.  I watch this dvd every year on Sept. 30, close to the hour of Dean's death.  So much of the film captures Jimmy Dean as a very sensitive young man whose bold heart knew very few limits.  Although he was very myopic, he was a basketball and track ""star"" (he averaged 15 points a game in a three game semi-final in an era when 15 points in a game was a lot, and set a pole vault record for that region which was only broken years later).  I found it interesting that Marcus Winslow Sr. commented that Jimmy ""must have broken 15 pairs of glasses"" playing sports.  Although he was short in stature he had the heart of a lion.  I was also pleased with the summation, or the conclusion, where the narrator, Martin Gable reminds us of the positive images of youth Jimmy left us.  So many other documentaries, including the ones with Bill Bast, or Peter Lawford, are so much hearsay, and are speculative at best.",1254355200,4,1066,4.435897435897436

7944097,4,B00005LKHT,"Released two years after Dean's death at the untimely age of twenty-four, THE JAMES DEAN STORY is a valuable document as it includes interviews with many of the family and close friends who knew him - his grandmother, his aunt and uncle, his acquaintances in New York and Hollywood, and other workers who befriended him. Sometimes their testimonies seem somewhat stilted on screen, as if co-directors Robert Altman and George W. George had rehearsed their dialogue beforehand and were prompting them into making reactions. On the other hand their love for Dean seems palpable, despite his reputation for being difficult.

Narrated by theater actor and sometime director Martin Gabel, the film paints a portrait of a troubled personality whose father and mother died young and who was brought up in rural Indiana by his aunt and uncle. Although extremely helpful with the chores, young Dean always appeared lonely, as if in search for something he could never access. Apparently he used to spend a lot of time under a favorite tree, that not only served as a place of sanctuary but gave him the time and space to reflect.

He cut his theatrical teeth at school, and then decided to make the big move from Indiana to New York. After a short time in the wilderness, he landed a role in the short-lived production SEE THE JAGUAR (1952), but shot to stardom two years later in THE IMMORALIST, adapted by Ruth and Augustus Goetz from the novel by Andr Gide. His raw energy, stimulated by loneliness, produced an electrifying performance that outshone those of his costars Geraldine Page and Louis Jourdain.

Yet this was not enough for him - after a dispute with the producer, Dean walked out on THE IMMORALIST to seek his fortune in Hollywood. After spending many nights sequestered in local hostelries, hobnobbing with stars and hangers-on, he landed a leading role in EAST OF EDEN (1955), directed by Elia Kazan. The rest, as they say, is history.

Gabel's narration sounds a little portentous at times, but nonetheless we are given a portrait of a complex personality at once alienated from yet keenly desirous of praise from the world. His career really took off with the help of father-figure directors such as Kazan and Nicholas Ray, who understood his potential and made every effort to develop it. Dean was a mercurial actor - even more so than his illustrious contemporary Marlon Brando - who never gave the same performance twice, either on stage or screen. If a director could develop that raw energy, then they could be assured of a memorable performance from him.

True to the spirit of the late Fifties, we are not told about the actor's alleged bisexuality. Our attention focuses rather on the way in which the actor did not perform on screen at all, but simply drew upon his perpetual feelings of alienation and loneliness to produce a series of electrifying screen characterizations. Truly he was an icon of the times, whose early demise only served to enhance his legendary status.",1462492800,,2994,4.87426326129666

On the down side, my copy is flawed, and pauses every 30 seconds or so for a few seconds, then starts up again. Very annoying, and some dialogue is missed. I'd buy another copy, but I'm afraid it might be the same. Did anyone else have this problem? I attach a painting I did right after his death.
