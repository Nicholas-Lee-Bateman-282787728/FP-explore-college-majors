8484101,3,B005R40XQK,"The film runs about 55 minutes, instead of the original length of 60 minutes, which cuts out a few amusing parts, like ice going on the top of the head someone who looked like 1950's to 1970's goaltender Gump Worsley  and the part when Wayne takes a penalty.

How do I know? Hockey Night In Canada years before Coache's Corner once played this film in the 1st intermission.

Choppy VHS quality Film does freeze along with the cuts

Good viewing of how hockey was played in the 1930s, especially with the Goalie using his stick as a sweeper as they basically wore regular hockey gloves back then.

Also interesting that Wayne is shown to be shooting both right and left handed, like Gordie Howe did in 1940's to 1970's

Typical poverty row 1930's film product sappy melodrama that is now amusing today",1445644800,,800,4.598591549295775
