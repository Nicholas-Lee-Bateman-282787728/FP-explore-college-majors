8546885,5,B00A6EZDPW,"Original title of this was Come non detto roughly meaning best left unsaid. Released as Tell no one which makes it sound a tad sinister but it is actually a very warm comedy. It is all about Mattia who is gay but is too ashamed / afraid to come out to his parents, he has to his friends and has had to suffer abuse at school too. So he is moving to Madrid to live with his boyfriend  Eduardo. The thing is he has told Eduardo that his family are all in the know and are all happy swinging liberal types who welcome his gayness.

The problem is that his father keeps displaying behaviour that is almost homophobic, his mother is a bag of nerves, his sister is a resentful baby making machine and his 83 year old gran keeps applying for any job that is advertised irrespective of how unsuitable that it may be for her. Then on the eve of Mattias leaving, Eduardo tells him that  big surprise  he is arriving in Italy that night for his farewell diner party.

What follows is a very funny, often a bit madcap but always entertaining romp as Mattia and friends try to stop his whole world from blowing up in his face.

I really enjoyed this, it is well acted, over the top when it needs to be stupid in the right places and with good translations in the sub titles; everyone was engaging and even the end credits were good. This is one that it is very easy to recommend and I hope you ruddy well enjoy it as much as I did.",1390003200,2,1418,4.156934306569343
