7959913,4,B000063UU3,"Director/producer/screenwriter William Byron Hillman returns eight years later with a semi-remake/sequel to his first film, THE PHOTOGRAPHER (1974), once again starring Michael Callan (LEPRECHAUN 3 - 1995) as psycho cameraman Adrian Wilde, who apparently survived the fatal stabbing in the finale of the first film. Adrian is still as unstable as ever, living in a Winnebago and apparently killing prostitutes at night (the latest victim is an undercover cop in drag, who gets an icepick graphically shoved through his neck), while making weekly visits to his psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Curtis (Seymour Cassel; DEATH GAME - 1977), and complaining about the lack of ""nice girls"" in Los Angeles. When leaving the doctor's office, he meets Mindy Jordache (Joanna Pettet; THE EVIL - 1978) in the elevator and talks her into having dinner with him. Adrian makes a living as an advertising photographer and his latest assignment is taking publicity photos of his brother B.J. (James Stacy; PAPER MAN - 1971), a racecar driver who lost an arm and a leg in a racing accident (Stacy lost both appendages in real life in a 1973 motorcycle accident). B.J. is a bitter man whose wife left him after the accident and took the kids with her, leaving him an abusive alcoholic and a misogynist. Adrian and Mindy go on their dinner date and hit it off, agreeing to go on a second date the next night, but a series of events will make that date hard to keep. That night, Adrian has a nightmare where he kills a pretty swimsuit model in a pool, so he make a pact with B.J. to keep him company every night just to make sure the nightmares don't turn into reality. It doesn't work. The next night, another hooker (an early role for Sally Kirkland) has her neck snapped by someone wearing brown leather gloves (the film takes-on a giallo atmosphere in this scene) and when the swimsuit model Adrian dreamed about is actually found dead in the pool, Adrian grows more despondent and ignores phone calls from Mindy. Meanwhile, cops Sgt. Fontain (Pamela Hensley; THE NUDE BOMB - 1980) and Sgt. Buckhold (David Young; MARY. MARY, BLOODY MARY - 1975) catch flak from their police chief (Cleavon Little) for failing to catch the killer. The question soon becomes: Is Adrian the killer or could it be someone else? Could it be B.J., who manages to insult every woman he meets, as well as taunting Adrian's homosexual assistant, Lewis (Don Potter), thanks to his deep-seated hatred for his ex-wife? Or could it be Dr. Curtis, who seems to take a more-than-professional interest in Adrian's nightmares? What about Mindy? We really know nothing about her except that she is a patient of Dr. Curtis. What is she being treated for? Adrian's nightmares increase, including images of Mindy being stabbed in the stomach, himself being blown away by a jealous husband with a shotgun and killing a model by sticking her head in a plastic garbage bag containing a live rattlesnake. When more and more of Adrian's subjects end up murdered in real life and Mindy is stabbed just like in his nightmares, the real killer reveals himself (it's not much of a surprise), only to be stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle by Mindy, who is not quite as dead as in Adrian's dreams.  Though not as frenetic as THE PHOTOGRAPHER, director Hillman (RAGIN' CAJUN - 1991) eschews that film's PG rating and goes for the R-rated goods here, including plentiful female nudity (featuring a rare topless scene by Joanna Pettet) and some gory murders. Unlike THE PHOTOGRAPHER, Michael Callan has only one freak-out scene here, something that made the first film such a hoot to watch. The addition of James Stacy as Callan's brother is a good choice because they closely resemble each other and share the same mannerisms, which gives the film a shot of believability. Hillman also offers us a cast of great character actors, including Seymour Cassel, Cleavon Little and Robert Tessier as Aleck the bartender, but the roles are so underwritten, they are wasted. As it stands, DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a passable way to spend 95 minutes of your life, but it lacks the looniness factor of its predecessor. Sometimes nudity and blood cannot replace the air of insanity, something THE PHOTOGRAPHER had in spades. Also starring Misty Rowe, Frances Bay, Alfred Mazza, Jenna Tomasina and an early bit part by ex-SNL'er Victoria Jackson. Excellent original OAR print from Scorpion Releasing.",1401840000,3,4412,4.882666666666666
7959914,5,B000063UU3,"I loved this movie.  James Stacy is a great actor and I enjoy all his movies and tv appearances.

This is an edge of you set who do it with a twist.",1390262400,2,148,3.59375
7959915,3,B000063UU3,"Adrian (Michael Callan) is a troubled photographer. He dreams about people dying and they actually die the way he dreamed it, go figure. He lives in a large travel trailer, drives a 928 Porsche, wears his shirts open, and has some of the worse pick-up lines ever...except for the ones used by his brother (James Stacy) who is missing an arm and a leg.

There are two cops tracking the killer (Pamela Hensley, David Young) who work for the proverbial angry black chief (Cleavon Little). The cast includes minor roles by Misty Rowe and Victoria Jackson before she discovered Big Macs. The film overall is poorly scripted and acted. The hair styles and automobiles did bring back some memories.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Joanna Pettet from Casino Royale, Sally Kirkland of General Hospital, Jeana Keough a ZZ Top Video girl, Debbie Zipp)",1351036800,4,846,4.909090909090909
7959916,2,B000063UU3,"Despite the good cast, decent acting, and an insulting cheat of an ending when you discover who has been doing the killing. Some of the characters' traits go up and
down; this way and that. The fault is most likely on the script. The production has the feel of a made for tv movie except when delving into the the sleazy sheen with the back alleys, prostitutes, and mud wrestling scene. Not bloody for a ""psycho-killer"" film,
, just boring. The relationship between the two brothers has a few nice scenes and Joanna Petit is fine as usual (but deserves better). Cleavon Little has a throwaway
role as police sergeant, (he too deserves better). If you must see this, pick it up in one of those 50 movie packs from Mill Creek.",1342656000,,724,4.492424242424242
7959917,4,B000063UU3,"Written, produced, and directed by William Byron Hillman, Double Exposure (1983) is a movie that blurs the line between fantasy and reality, as a serial killer is operating in the Los Angeles area, leaving behind a trail of dead prostitutes and models.  A gritty example of 1980's exploitation cinema, this crime thriller doesn't shy away from violence directed at women, nudity, or gore.

Commercial photographer Adrian Wilde (Michael Callan) drives a Porche, lives in a mobile home, and has crazy dreams about killing people, usually his models while on a photo shoot.  He is seeing a psychiatrist, and telling him what is happening, but isn't making much progress.  News reports about additional victims continue, but suffering from memory lapses, Adrian can't remember if he was involved.

Adrian gets some support from his ex-stunt driver brother B.J. (James Stacey), who is handicapped by only having one leg, and his new girlfriend Mindy Jordache (Joanna Pettet), who wants to believe in him.  Police detectives Fontain (Pamela Hensley) and Buckhold (David Young) are assigned to catch the killer, and after a decoy is murdered with an ice pick, the Chief (Cleavon Little) intensifies the investigation.  Because of his association with the dead models, suspicion eventually points to Adrian Wilde.

There are some mean kills, a particularly long and nasty one involves a model being bitten by a poisonous snake, as a dispassionate Wilde snaps photos of the girl screaming and thrashing in agony.  Sally Kirland appears in a cameo as a back alley hooker, who displays her wares before having her neck brutally snapped.  Comedian Joey Foreman also appears briefly, before making a bloody exit.  If you blink you'll miss her, but SNL's Victoria Jackson appears as a racetrack model.  The biggest issue with the film is that many of the kills appear to be dreams, so what is real and what is fantasy, isn't always clear.  Although the movie serves up a heap of violence, it doesn't play fair with the audience following along looking for clues.

Playing brothers, Michael Callan (Cat Ballou) and James Stacey do resemble each other quite a bit facially.  Known for playing Johnny Lancer on the TV series Lancer (1968-70), Stacey lost his left leg and part of his left arm in an accident in 1973, so that's really him moving around on one leg, and even participating in a mud wrestling match, and not some camera trick.  With an acting career that was mostly on television, Joanna Pettet makes a rare film appearance.  She does a fine job, as there are some sensitive moments, and even she exposes some flesh.  Callan also does good job, but his character might be a more sympathetic, if only we could tell for sure, if what we are seeing is real.

With some decent acting performances, Double Exposure isn't total exploitive, misogynistic trash, but there is a fair amount of nudity, and the movie plays games with the audience, to showcase what are often the graphic murders of women.  If you enjoy a psychological thriller from the 80's, spiced with some sex, you may want to give this a watch.  Making its first appearance on DVD, the film has been remastered, and the ""Katarina's Nightmare Theater"" edition contains some clips featuring horror actress and hostess, Katarina Winters introducing the film, and also interviewing Michael Callan.  Callan also participates in one of two commentary tracks.",1331337600,11,3408,5.00531914893617
7959918,5,B000063UU3,"This Movie will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat!  Different kind of role for Jim Stacyl however, as always, AWESOME!",1255478400,,131,4.458333333333333
7959919,2,B000063UU3,"Starring:  Ian Buchanan, Jennifer Gatti, James McEachin, William R. Moses, Ron Perlman, Dedee Pfeiffer.

A jealously possessive husband (Buchanan) finds that his ""girl in cotton wool"" wife (Gatti) is having an affair.  He has a contract put out on the mystery boyfriend but the hit is botched and his wife is killed instead.  Now he wants both the mystery boyfriend and the hit man dead...but who the ""mystery boyfriend"" and ""hit man"" turn out to be....

This is TV movie quality with a nice twist at the end (50-50 chance you'll guess it).  Has some semi graphic sex scenes.

Ron Perlman has a supporting role (but top billing!) as a private investigator with secrets both past and present, and he gives his usual solid performance.

Favorite line(s):  spoken by the husband to his and his wife's friend: ""You would tell me if she were having an affair, wouldn't you?"" her reply:  ""Would I tell her if you were having an affair?""",1104278400,2,930,4.720496894409938
