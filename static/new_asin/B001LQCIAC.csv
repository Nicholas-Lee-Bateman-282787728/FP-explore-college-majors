3690725,2,B001LQCIAC,"I have to echo Jake/Jerome on his review. The speaker is by himself in what looks to be a railroad car. The shots are distracting and diagonal. It makes me think that he is talking to himself.  He is sitting/static and there are rows of seats behind and in front of him. That is not the way to get your message across.  The producer could have made much better choices here.

It would have been much more powerful to have a video of a live presentation. But then again, I'm not sure the speaker would have all the 'facts' down live. And yes, the talk is a non-exciting. It's almost like listening to a magazine article.  I don't get why they made this video.  What is being said is not new, not informative, and not exciting.  The speaker does not seem that excited with what he is saying.  He is not pumped up.  And this lack of energy makes then entire thing just drag on.  If you are interested in the new physics of belief then some What the Bleep or similar would draw you in much better.

If you have a chance to see this at some social/spiritual gathering that might be the best way. Otherwise it's something you would only watch once.  In fact if you search the tube of you this will be found.",1251676800,9,1201,4.246696035242291
3690726,4,B001LQCIAC,"Loved this. Gregg Braden makes sense of science in a really easy to understand way.  He uses his ability to spot patterns in history, science, religious history, anything really and puts them together to show how they support each other as part of a bigger whole.

For so long spirituality has been stuck in a world of pure faith, unprovable and often ridiculed for being factless.  Now is the time that the facts are starting to come together to prove there is something in it all.

Gregg's manner is engaging and interesting.  He makes light work of these heavy subjects such as quantum physics and religion and presents it in a meaningful and powerful way.

Even the most skeptical can't deny factual evidence.  It's heartening to think where we are going as a society.  I look forward to what we're heading for.  His other book around 2012 is an extension of this and equally captivating.",1249430400,8,892,4.703225806451613
3690727,5,B001LQCIAC,"I have had this DVD for awhile now. I have just watched it again. It's got some really great content. The reviewer that says the quality is not good, does not make any sense, the quality is fine. Is it the production level of ""The Secret"" no. It's mostly just Gregg Speaking in a train car and with a few cut away sequences. But the actual Video quality is good, it's not grainy or pixleated there are no poorly done green screen effects. If you want to see very bad quality of production look at ""Pass It On"" or ""Beyond The Secret"" both have poor quality green screen and the later the video is awful. So maybe after seeing what's out there I see that this production quality is not bad at all. It's just not a motivational masterpiece like ""The Secret"" (original version).

But the content makes this worth the money. He really go into the power of thought, emotion and feeling. Several times from several different sources and tells you about scientific studies to back it it up. There is even a video on ultrasound on a women being healed in less than 3 minutes of a tumor.

Great video! All that I expected and more. The only down side is if you have listened to some of Greggs interviews you will see much of that in this one as all of his interviews say the same thing. But really that's the way it is with all authors and people as well.

If I asked you to tell me about your work you would tell me the same thing you told the last ten people, we all have our scripts we works from, unless you are a compulsive liar and make everything up on the spot for each person.",1247184000,19,1575,4.225913621262459
3690728,5,B001LQCIAC,"Gregg Braden has tackled an enormous subject and made it simple to understand.  He has taken a vast amount of research information and communicated the findings back to us in a condensed message with logic and clarity.  I appreciate Gregg Braden's style of communication because of his scientific approach.  He doesn't just philosophize but names the research studies he used, which allows me to double-check the information in detail.  I have studied many people's work on this subject, and Gregg Braden gets an A+ for his communication ability.",1245628800,7,546,5.170454545454546
3690729,5,B001LQCIAC,"Amazing information crammed into this short 1 hour video of Gregg Braden presenting exciting ground-breaking information, scientific observations, and spiritual philosophies.  Although this information may appear in other videos and books by Gregg Braden it does not take away from the fact that the information within this film will change the way one looks at the world, (or at least give one something interesting to think about!) and in doing so it will change your life.",1240617600,33,475,5.25
3690730,2,B001LQCIAC,"3 Stars would be generous as.  4 stars for content and 1 for visual experience.  I would grade it as a 2.5.  While the content is interesting there isn't much variation to keep interest.  First, it is just Gregg in a train car speaking the entire time.  There are a couple of very basic diagrams, pictures, and brief videos that are put on the screen to demonstrate points, but the quality is poor and low budget.  Most shocking was that it says that the video was produced in 2005!!!  This DVD is released in 2009!  There is a bonus interview that took place in 2006 that says pretty much the same thing that was on the featured interview. Is Hay House that hard up for $?  Very poor representation on the publisher and Gregg Braden.  I have seen more interesting work from student projects.

The content is very interesting and applicable.  However, much of what is said is the same as what he says in Heal Your Life Now by Louis Hay.  I recommend that you buy that DVD and watch Gregg's segment on that.  That DVD is phenomenal.  While I respect Gregg Braden and value what he is doing and saying, I have to be honest in saying that I am disappointed that I pre-ordered a 4 year old conversation that I have heard quite a few times now.  IMO I would be embarrassed to have this represent my latest work as compared to what others are producing out there.  It breaks my heart to be this honest but hopefully something greater will emerge from Braden next time.",1240358400,62,1462,4.37546468401487
3690731,5,B001LQCIAC,"I admit it.  So far I've liked everything Braden.  If you can't see him in person then his dvd's are the next best thing.  Gregg packs a lot of info into this short (about an hour) dvd.  I'd buy it.  Oh wait...I already did.  If you like Braden, you'll like this.",1354060800,,263,4.0588235294117645
3690732,4,B001LQCIAC,"It was a clear easy to understand dvd, with insightful, and proven information.  I would reccomend this to anyone who needs
proof, about metaphysics.",1342742400,,149,5.208333333333333
3690733,5,B001LQCIAC,"I teach personal development and the more I do, the more I SEE how powerful ""thinking and feeling"" is to our results. 15 years ago, a person I met in a music class told me he was in his 5th cancer-free year. He was the only one of 5 in his group who survived advanced brain cancer. He said, when they were putting the chemo drugs in him, he listened to music that completely took him over in an emotionally positive way. He did this every time. At the time he told me this,he was struggling to understand why he survived and the others didn't. We know more today about the connections of thinking and the body.  I have never had cancer but I had long term chronic pain that literally went away when I changed my thinking and fed my subconscious better ""food"". So PLEASE who cares what happened in the past. Maybe what we thought does have something to do with our ills of today but we can do NOTHING about that. All we can do is choose what we do right now.  So GO FOR IT. Do everything your doctor says that makes sense to you and do this too.  It's real. It has the potential to help and don't let any ""half-cup-empty"" person stop you from doing your own exploring and exerimenting.",1287446400,2,1184,4.230088495575221
3690734,3,B001LQCIAC,"THe DVD was defective so we could watch very little.  What we did see looked very interesting, so it was frustrating not to be able to see the whole thing.",1286582400,,155,4.166666666666667
3690735,5,B001LQCIAC,"Buy this one for the information, not to be ""entertained"".  Excellent, easy to understand information.  Great accompaniment to ""What the Bleep, Quantum Edition""DVD.  Explains more simply some of it's content. Great on its own too.  Just Braden, sitting and talking though",1281916800,2,271,5.536585365853658
3690736,5,B001LQCIAC,"Greg Braden combines wideness of vision with the science to back it up. He has a clear way of talking that is easy to listen to and has fascinating things to say about how what we feel are miracles are often just the way things work. At various periods of history our world view has been shaken by a new way of looking at the world, as when we found that the sun didn't revolve around us. This is another such time. His visuals are good and illustrative without being distracting. I highly recommend it.",1274140800,4,503,4.3052631578947365
3690737,1,B001LQCIAC,"I'm a big Gregg Braden fan, but have only read his books. I was looking forward to seeing and hearing him on the screen. I was sorely disappointed - as a matter of fact, I could barely stay awake, in spite of being intensely interested in the subject.

The movie is set inside a train or trolley car - can't really tell which. Gregg spends the whole movie talking directly to someone that you can't see and never makes a sound. [Rather than looking into the camera or audience] Then, the DVD hung up twice and missed big sections when it got back on track. The whole production was boring and unimaginative - not good for a medium that depends on engaging the viewer's emotions and imagination for its success.

I like Gregg, but if all his videos are like this one, he should definitely stick to writing books.",1271203200,5,811,4.436241610738255
3690738,5,B001LQCIAC,"I just watched The Science of Miracles and really enjoyed it. I would recommend purchasing it if you want to know more about the science behind prayer, healing, quantum physics, non-locality, connections with others, law of attraction, etc.  I have read most of Greg's books cover to cover and enjoyed seeing him tell some of the stories I have read about in his books. He also speaks on new information and touches on subjects in quantum physics, DNA research, non-locality, water crystals, and healing. He cites several scientific studies and allows us to observe a wondrous healing event too. While Greg's prodution could have been a bit better as some other reviewers noted below - the reason I purchsed this DVD was not for fancy graphics, or production settings. What I wanted and needed was the information within the DVD and I truly enjoyed the chance to see Greg B. present it.",1261958400,5,886,4.828947368421052
3690739,5,B001LQCIAC,"I love this DVD --- Gregg Braden is a powerful source of knowledge, research, and cutting edge thought that opens minds, releases resistance, awakens probability!  He is genuine and compassionate in his delivery and it is very thought provoking for using the tool of prayer in Divine Use.  His facts and studies can awaken or shed light on possibility that even the most skeptic of thinkers will ponder on the possibility.",1257811200,4,422,4.929577464788732

8319461,5,B001LQCIAC,"I saw parts of this in a local coaches meeting and really liked what I saw. Gregg Braden goes into detail about how and why what we think has an affect on what happens to our bodies. For anyone who believes in the mind-body connection, this is for you.
I love the knowledge that Epigenetics has brought us, and this breaks it down into simple understanding. I purchased this for my Reiki certification classes so that I can help my students really grasp how and why our thoughts matter when dealing with health.

I highly recommend!!",1389571200,2,533,4.552083333333333
