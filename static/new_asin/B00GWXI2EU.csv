6121134,4,B00GWXI2EU,If you liked Line of Duty 1 then this is for you. Darker and with more twists and the same moral ambiguity as it's predecessor. A winner .,1395792000,10,138,3.9642857142857144
6121135,5,B00GWXI2EU,"If you thought the first season was power packed, wait until you see this one.  No spoilers, but the first episode knocked me out of my chair.  The plot is so skillfully wrought that just as I was thinking there was a ;letdown in episodes 2/3, I realized that I was as taken in as the investigators.  Great twists, much tension, high mystery...and the most morally ambiguous ending I've ever seen.  You'll love it.
Sorry Amazon...it's free on a competitor right now (3/23).",1395532800,20,473,4.662650602409639

6121179,5,B00GWXI2EU,"I think this British police/murder mystery series is up there with Foyles War, and Midsummer Murders as some of the top British series of this type genre. I have all the series on DVD and hope they continue to film this series as I think it's one of the best if not the best I've seen. I especially like that they continue one major plot throughout each episode of the season series. Very well done.",1511222400,,399,4.333333333333333

6121185,5,B00GWXI2EU,"When will American TV ever learn that we are capable of a deep thought provoking series the way BBC has for years! Line of Duty is one of those RARE shows that is both intense and real. Nothing is black and white but gray. Life and crime are not simple. The Police make mistakes and are human and at times they are blind to what is right in front of them. The ""Bad"" Cops are as layered as any characters I have ever seen and are so complex that it's hard to decide if they are ""bad,"" ""misguided,"" or doing what the investigator might do under the same difficult circumstances. Humans are very complex and this show brings it all out into the open.",1500768000,,647,4.225806451612903
6121186,2,B00GWXI2EU,"First season was pretty good, but this second season is a complete drag. The acting and writing is poor. I gave it a chance through episode three, and I don't care to watch anymore. Skipping to season three, with hopes that the story and acting will be worth it again.",1500595200,,268,4.38

6121227,5,B00GWXI2EU,good series,1495497600,,11,5.0
6121228,2,B00GWXI2EU,"I liked the first series of Line of Duty, but there are so many loose ends by the conclusion that you are sure to feel let down. For example, who was really behind the conspiracy? Who was the actual target of the conspiracy? Why was one the conspirators killed themselves? Why didn't the conspirators try harder to find the missing girl? Why did only one person go to prison, etc.? Plus, the characters are not very interesting or likable, and there is much less action than similar U.S. dramas. I'll admit that I am not the best at following complicated plot twists, but I still felt that I had wasted six hours watching something that was really not tied together at the end like most other good mysteries.",1492473600,,708,4.5390625
6121229,5,B00GWXI2EU,"Excellent. Truly excellent. Do catch this hit BBC police drama, filmed in Northern Ireland. Winner of the Royal Television Society Award for Best Drama Series, this critically acclaimed, wonderfully cast and intricately plotted program is wildly popular in the United Kingdom, and understandably so. A highly anticipated fourth installment in the series is slated for release in 2017.",1488758400,,384,5.637931034482759
6121230,5,B00GWXI2EU,"I thought it was impossible to surpass Season 1. But Season 2 has a new spellbinding plot, new actors, and many of the old favorites. Could it possibly be.....better? We're binge-watching this season too. Now I'm wondering if they can possible keep this up in Season 3. But it's like Homeland, the writing, the suspense, the smart characters and dialogue, it's just excellent",1488499200,,375,4.968253968253968

6121233,4,B00GWXI2EU,"I would have given this show five stars except for a couple of things that are my personal problems.  I am hard of hearing and although I have state of the art hearing aids, I still have trouble with the accents. The captioning is really terrible.  It is small and thin.  Hard to read as it stays up for such a short time. not only that, but it is not synchronized with the dialogue.  Other than that, the show is interesting and pretty fast paced.  One of the few mystery shows where I am not really sure who is the worst of the bad guys. The wanton corruption makes one wonder if this is pure fiction, or if it may hint at what goes on in the police departments of the country where this story is located.",1486339200,2,707,4.131386861313868
6121234,5,B00GWXI2EU,"I have written my review of these superb Police dramas on Amazon UK, but a word of warning to those who love the 'Extras'  about the making of the shows and the Star interviews. I only watched the first series on TV--and recently bought the season two DVD, which has 2 discs. Before the 1st disc ends, you have the option to watch the 'Extras',  RESIST. There is far too much spoiling on it, which although is of an excellent quality, I strongly recommend you watch the 2nd disc  ( the completion)  before watching the 'Extras'. which show you how they created certain scenes that you haven't yet watched, which is a huge spoiler. Personally, I do NOT like seeing how certain tricky scenes are faked, ignorance can be bliss.  P G Croft UK.",1486252800,,739,4.485074626865671

6121297,5,B00GWXI2EU,Simply outstanding. Brit handicraft. Short. To the point. Definitely and painfully biting. Our society ain't what it ought to be.,1485648000,,129,5.5
6121298,4,B00GWXI2EU,"I loved the first season.  This season, I can't find one character to like, and I think that is an artistic mistake.  It is, however, powerful in the way it shows all the ways in which self-interest drives public actions.  It brings home to me my belief that an individualistic, competitive society is corrupt by its very nature.  However, because this drama is so intense, I can only watch it in increments as I get emotionally involved and angry at the idiocy that I know it is reflecting back to us about our society - be it the UK or the US.",1485561600,,545,4.313725490196078
6121299,3,B00GWXI2EU,"I enjoyed Series 2 and would give it 5 stars except for 2 things:  the disturbing violence and when you get to series 3, you have to pay!  Amazon has done that before.  You get a show or series for free then when they have you hooked they make you pay.  Not fair.  They show that 3 series are available then when you get to series 3, you have to pay.",1485475200,,350,3.8732394366197185

6121302,5,B00GWXI2EU,I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as series 1; but series 2 proved to be even more exceptional. The pathos of moral decisions and the attendant consequences portrayed with exceptional acting make this a must see.,1485129600,,214,4.657894736842105

6121462,5,B00GWXI2EU,Keeley Hawes is no Mrs Durrell in this police corruption tale. Is she clean or is she bent?? She's certainly a bit mad and manipulating. Should watch Series 1 to get a handle on the regulars in the Squad that is trying to weed out corrupt cops. This is a whole new strand with different case that has a connection to the mobster arrested in the first series.,1481068800,,358,4.279411764705882

6121484,5,B00GWXI2EU,"I agree with the other reviews - this series is a mind blower, and much as I liked the first one, this eclipses it.  You think you know, then you don't, then you think...a real roller coaster.  Wanted to smack Steve a couple of times, but...  Eager to get into series 3.

6121536,5,B00GWXI2EU,"The Line of Duty series is extremely well done - good writing, complex plots and great actors.  As an American viewer, it gives me great insight into the procedural differences between the policing practices in the U.K. and those in the U.S.",1476921600,,241,4.738095238095238

It is wonderful and by far one of the very best British detective/police dramas. Highly recommend to anyone who likes intelligent scripts and outstanding acting.

6121539,5,B00GWXI2EU,"This series is a stunner. Season 2 was up and down as you can't quite figure how all the pieces fit together. Yet, it sets up the next season with dramatic flare at the end.

Everything I would say has already been written by lots of reviewers, but I feel compelled to add my voice to the rave reviews.  Seasons 1 and 2 are different, but characters and plotlines are overarching. And in season 2, is that REALLY Keeley Hawes???!!!  I found her performance absolutely riveting, couldn't believe it was she of MI5!  All the actors are fabulous, in both seasons

I stayed up til the wee hours to finish the show, a complete binge-watch!  I don't usually do this but I could NOT stop watching .  The twists and turns do not stop, they just keep coming like rolling balls of fire, each one igniting yet another.

It seems that almost no police officer can avoid doing something wrong and the worse of them are ready to murder each other. Motivations are frequently murky. Why, for example, should prison authorizes target someone for talking to a unit investigating police officers? On the other hand, there is an excsllent portrayal of the difficulty in sorting out the truth when all of the witnesses are untrustworthy. Issues are left unresolved presumably to be dealt with in series 3. Above all, this is compulsively watchable series.",1454976000,3,626,5.27

6121904,5,B00GWXI2EU,"I've watched both Series 1 and 2 and have no idea why PBS America hasn't picked up this show!  I found both seasons riveting.  The British version of Police Internal Affairs, the cast of this show are involved in investigations of police misconduct.  There is one character being investigated in each series and in the beginning, it appears so clear that the subject is guilty but as time goes on, you're really not sure.  The ""bent cops,"" as the British call them, are so complex that it's hard to decide if they are ""bad,"" ""misguided,"" or doing what the investigator might do under the same difficult circumstances.  At various points I hated them, pitied them, and wasn't sure about them.  Each of these actors (Keeley Hawes and Lennie James) deserves (and has apparently won) awards for his/her roles.  Must see performances!  The cast of investigating officers is also first rate. The plots raise a variety of moral questions, and have more twists and turns than a carnival ride.  I just couldn't stop watching.  My only criticism is that the conclusion of season two was extremely confusing.  Apparently I wasn't the only one who had issues figuring it out.  The show's writer eventually ended up apologizing to the viewers because the editing caused some important content to be omitted.  There were explanations online so viewers could fully understand what happened.  It's an indication of just how good this show is that I'm rating it 5 stars even though the ending was ambiguous.  Viewers should be prepared that there is some pretty violent content.  I had to look the other way in more than a few cases.",1439337600,4,1616,4.821818181818182

6121909,5,B00GWXI2EU,"The intricate detail that builds in this drama should appeal to mystery lovers and trial lawyers.  British cops apparently do the work that DA investigators do in America.  That is, if this drama depicts cops in Britain in a true light, and I believe it does.  If half of what Ive been led to believe about the corruption in the British police forces is true, anyway.

More than just showing official corruption, it tells a tight story that demands much of the viewer and is well rewarded.  Great acting and the ending is not what you might expect. Each of the main characters (except Deputy Chief Constable Mike Dryden (Mark Bonnar) who is pure non-stop sleaze) will from time to time gain both your sympathy and your distrust.

Tip: Pay close attention to the opening scenes in Episode One, about 3 minutes or so. There are clues to be found. They aren't revealed until the end of Episode Six.  Dont worry if you don't spot them, though. It won't diminish your enjoyment of the story.",1437436800,2,986,4.6

6121990,1,B00GWXI2EU,"I rate the series itself at 4-5 stars.  Many people have already reviewed the plot and the quality of the acting so I will not repeat those positive reviews here.  The 1-star rating is because in the Amazon Instant Video version, each episode is only 50 minutes long rather than the full 60 minutes.  Each episode is missing the final 10 minutes, so in the first 5 episodes you miss out on key plot twists and events. In the final episode, you cannot see the ending!  Amazon should NOT be selling products which are missing content.

Amazon refunded my purchase of the instant video season and I was able to purchase the Region 1 DVD's which are, according to the posted information, 369 minutes for the 6 episodes, plus bonus programming.  The DVD's do cost twice what the instant video season does, but I felt it was worth it to see the entirety of each episode.

You can see Series 2 without having seen Series 1 but they are tied together.

After seeing more average UK series such as Hinterland, Shetland, Spooks (still all worthy of watching) it is refreshing to see something hit so far out of the ballpark.  A must see.

6122233,2,B00GWXI2EU,"My reaction to season two of Line of Duty is so completely at odds with the preceding reviewers that I suppose you can consider me an extreme outlier in this case. I'll certainly grant that the casting is very good, and the performances are in the main excellent. There's an excellent underlying tension and slow build-up of relationships among the elements of the story, but in the end, that story becomes so involved and far-fetched that despite the perhaps unmatched degree of plot reversals and surprises, I lost real interest in this along the way, with only a small nagging curiosity egging me on to the end. Along  the way there are a few ""conveniences ex machina"": for example, the supposition that an upper story hospital room -- and an intensive care room at that -- has windows without screens that can open. Plot twists are generally a plus, but this series reaches way too far in the cause of twist for the sake of twist. If your gullibility is high and you enjoy surprises, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're the type of person who analyzes plot and frequently asks questions of the stories you read or watch, this may not be your cup of tea. Again, it's well-acted and produced, but the storyline is quite a stretch. I didn't care for it.",1411344000,5,1254,4.598214285714286
6122234,5,B00GWXI2EU,"As with its predecessor, Series 2 of Line of Duty, the BBCs brilliant series about crime and police corruption, starts with a bang and never falters.  DCI Lindsay Denton (Keeley Hawes) is summoned by an undercover officer to assist with the emergency transport of an informant in protective custody.  Denton, alone in the lead car, abruptly changes the agreed-upon route and the results a disaster:  shes forced off the road head on into a tree while the trailing car is rammed, shot-up, and fire bombed, leaving 3 cops (including the undercover officer who first called for help) dead and the protected witness hospitalized in critical condition.  Only Denton escapes relatively unscathed, and she quickly is suspected of playing a role in setting up the ambush, opening the door to AC-12, the internal unit charged with investigating police corruption.  When series regulars DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) and DC Kate Fleming (Vicki McClure) are ordered to take charge of the investigation, Fleming declines because shes been having an affair with the husband of the now-dead undercover officer.  Arnott and his new partner, DC Georgia Trotman (Jessica Raine) have barely begun their work when they're sent racing to the hospital to protect the injured informant.  They surprise an assassin, but Arnott is knocked out, Trotman is thrown out a window to her death, and the witness is killed.  All this in just the first episode.

As with Series 1, Line of Duty 2 burrows down into the uncomfortable and unpleasant areas of policing, where people and events are never quite what they seem to be.  Or are they?  The series relentlessly explores the personal and professional lives of police officers whose every action or lack thereof is subject to second guessing and suspicion by their superior officers, all the while leaving them vulnerable to enticement by criminals who know and ruthlessly exploit their weaknesses.  DCI Dentons sold her home to pay for her mothers nursing home care, and lives in a miserable bedsitter next door to an obnoxious drunk who blasts music through the walls in the wee hours of the morning.  DC Flemings been kicked out of her house for her affair.  DS Arnott sees nothing wrong with shagging a key witness in the investigation.  The dependable head of AC-12, Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) is estranged from his wife and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy due to failed investments.  Hastings is seeking patronage and promotion from Deputy Chief Constable Mike Dryden (Mark Bonnar), who is linked to the disappearance of a teenage girl brutally exploited by crime kingpin Tommy Hunter (Brian McCardie).  And Hunter just happens to be the secret police informant ambushed and then killed in the hospital.

Series 2 is anchored by an astonishing performance by Keeley Hawes as DCI Lindsay Denton.  Dentons the inverse of the charismatic extrovert Tony Gates, the main protagonist from Series 1.  Shes worn down by her crushing financial pressures and anything but respected or popular at work.  In fact, her colleagues despise her, particularly for her track record of complaints about discrimination and improper treatment.  But beneath her plain, weary demeanor Dentons as sharp as they come, utterly ruthless about going right for the throat of anyone who pushes her too far, and capable of explosive anger and violence.  Hawes makes Denton intensely unlikeable, and it is to her credit that were never sure if she is in the frame as a victim or perpetrator, or both.

To be fair, the ending of Series 2 is somewhat confusing, a fact the producers have acknowledged in post-production interviews.  This does not in any way detract from the exceptional quality of the writing and acting in Line of Duty.  Moody, dark, and rife with tension throughout, Line of Duty is like life can be: messy and anything but cleanly resolved.  Its easily the best cop show were likely to see.",1410998400,3,3928,5.030911901081916

6122236,5,B00GWXI2EU,"LINE OF DUTY, Series 2, 2014. The acclaimed British television series returns for a second series, with a new police corruption story told over six episodes. In this BBC-produced crime drama, a police convoy is ambushed and a protected witness seriously injured; DI Lindsay Denton (Keeley Hawes, MI-5) is the sole surviving officer. She is at first the most valuable witness, but soon becomes the prime suspect of the Anti-Corruption Unit (AC12) we met in the first  British mysteries series.  This box set consists of 6 episodes on 2 DVDs, running approximately 369 minutes plus bonus programing. Including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted and extended scenes and interviews with the cast and crew.  For mature audiences only please.  With subtitles, which are very helpful, thank you RLJ Entertainment/Acorn: the cast speaks clear Queens English, but with great speed, in tune with the show. I received this as a review copy.

 It is AC12s job to catch criminals, similarly to other police: but the unit  catches them in the cop shop.  The ambush of the police convoy has left three cops dead, in addition to the protected witness seriously injured.  Inevitably, in this police procedural, the unit will begin to look on DI Denton with suspicion.  The unit, which we  met before, includes Superintendent Ted Hastings, (the veteran Adrian Dunbar, THE CRYING GAME, ASHES TO ASHES); partners Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott, (Martin Compston, MONARCH OF THE GLEN, THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY), and Detective Constable Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure, BROADCHURCH, THIS IS ENGLAND).  Keeley Hawes, (MI-5, UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, ASHES TO ASHES) as DI Lindsay Denton, the prime target of their investigation, is a revelation.  As a younger woman, this extremely beautiful actress appeared in many, many British television series: but with the addition of a few years and a few pounds, she plays the 36-year old detective under suspicion with immense power and gravitas, and carries the production manfully.  As the unit investigates the ambush on the convoy, it seems they must look higher in the police hierarchy to find its instigator.  The episodes are:
Disc 1
EPISODE 1
After the ambush of the convoy,  investigation begins to center on DI Lindsay Denton, its sole survivor. Why did Denton allow it to proceed without backup or firearms? Why did she take the roundabout route she did? How did the ambush team know its whereabouts? Denton quickly goes from valuable witness to prime suspect.

EPISODE 2
Evidence against  the detective begins to mount, but she won't go down without a fight. She becomes increasingly erratic, but is able to uncover past actions of her investigators,DS Arnott, DC Fleming, and Superintendent Hastingsthat put them on the defensive.

EPISODE 3
Denton is targeted while in prison awaiting trial, and receives shockingly brutal treatment. She tells Fleming why she thinks she is being set up. Meanwhile, the mutilated body of a teenage girl is found buried beneath the floor of a disused industrial garage with ties to the case.

Disc 2
EPISODE 4
Denton alleges a high-level conspiracy and cover-up. She is granted special dispensation to leave prison to visit her dying mother; AC12 realizes she is a target for the perpetrators of the crime.

EPISODE 5
Denton fights for her life; details emerge of her relationship with a senior police officer. Hastings must confront a superior who holds the superintendent's future in his hands.

EPISODE 6
More facts about the ambush start to emerge; Denton seems to have found an advocate and ally in Arnott. Fleming , however, does not agree with her partner, and is determined to find him wrong.

This addictive series boasts superior acting, mousetrap timing, breathtaking twists and turns galore, up to the last second, and has been called the most tightly-plotted and nerve-shredding drama seen on British television in years by the (London) Daily Mail.  These six episodes of Series 2 have been compared to BROADCHURCH and PRIME SUSPECT, earned even better ratings than the first series, which was BBC Twos best performing drama series in 10 years.  The British press raved about it.  And me?  After years and years of grinding my teeth watching ridiculous female characters  scream for help as hero and villain fight to the death, wanting to scream myself to the woman, Please, please, just pick up that heavy lamp and bash the guy on the head, I have suddenly discovered several wonderful female-headed crime series in which the girls  give as good as they get.  Including this one.  I love it.",1409270400,10,4562,5.091397849462366
6122237,5,B00GWXI2EU,"Line of Duty is back and even more addictive this time around. Keeley Hawes (Upstairs, Downstairs and Ashes to Ashes) stars as DI Lindsay Denton, who survived the brutal ambush of a police convoy in the season 1 cliffhanger. She joins the returning cast that includes Vicky McClure and Martin Compston on the AC-12 squad (anti-corruption unit) to investigate the attack--and the answers are never easy. Six new episodes make Line of Duty very much worthy of binge-watching, and for those of us now hooked on this fast-paced procedural with its thrilling twists, two more seasons have already been green-lighted. Nice bonus on this set: cast and crew interviews (they enjoy it as much as we do).",1409097600,,694,4.94017094017094
6122238,5,B00GWXI2EU,"Even better than its predecessor, LINE OF DUTY Series 2 has expanded from five episodes to six and every minute is needed to tell its gripping story. The police anti-corruption unit is back, this time investigating Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton who has survived a police convoy ambush. In the excellent bonus features there is an interview with Keeley Hawes, who plays DI Denton. She describes her initial reading of the script as totally absorbing and leaving her uncertain until late in the last episode if she was guilty or not!

That is testimony to the superb writing of Jed Mercurio (who also wrote the first series and will write the next two commissions). How do you take the police genre on television and inject it with new vitality, with plot twists you just don't see coming and moral ambiguity without losing a moral centre? LINE OF DUTY does just that. It's an amazing show.

Keeley Hawes has often been associated with glamour roles but if anyone was ever ""de-glammed"" for a part, it is her. She is stunning in her portrayal of plainness and in her incredible courage to play against her image. She is, in short, a great actress and if this performance doesn't propel her into the elite of actresses on British television, I don't know what will. How it may or may not evolve into a film career of equal importance remains to be seen, but her portrayal of Lindsay Denton is award-worthy a dozen times over.

It is also a pleasure to see Martin Compston, Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure back and their characters further developed, even when ""Britain's Sweetheart"", Jessica Raine makes a surprise appearance, miles away from her wonderful leading role on Call The Midwife. She almost unseats Vicky McClure... but there will be no spoilers here.

The acting, like the writing and direction, is flawless. The shaky camera work is toned down, which is a huge improvement. Some of the supporting roles, such as Craig Parkinson and Neil Morrissey are absolutely gripping.

LINE OF DUTY Series 2 makes a very strong case for its claim by many to be the best police show ever made.",1408665600,,2093,4.7707182320441985
6122239,4,B00GWXI2EU,"Review of the Series 2  DVD and Bonus Features - I don't believe in spoilers
First off a few (I hope helpful) comments:

1. As I post this review  there are already a number of reviews of the brilliantly acted and directed thriller here on Amazon - quite a few with more detail than I think necessary for you to enjoy it  - and so I hope to provide you with enough info to understand the show but don't look for me to give any ""spoilers"".. with one small exception near the end - that I will ALERT  you to before I provide it. This review is based on the DVD version, which contains ""bonus features"" not on the Amazon Instant version.  I was provided an advance copy of the DVD.

2. If you have found this review and have not watched Series/Season 1, I'll suggest that you do that. Though things were fully wrapped up in that Season, you will get to know the main characters better if you start there and - not a spoiler - in my opinion, that Series was a bit better than Series 2.

Okay, so if you are with me, I'll ""carry on:

LOD2 was produced in 2013 by a Northern Ireland production company and aired on the BBC2 network in the UK. It was not (like ""Sherlock"" or ""Downton Abbey) actually produced by the BBC. But it's still a fine production.  The first series has five hour-long episodes; this time there are six. While season one was not a ""mystery"" per se, but more of a ""police procedure"" show, this time around there are lots of mysteries. And even more grisly graphic violence. (I'll stop here for a moment to say that there are graphic violence moments here stronger than I ever remember in a TV series (cable or not), and viewers should be aware of this, though the script and acting make it worth watching.) There are a few swear words but it's the violence will turn many viewers stomachs.

I won't give you the plot - you really don't need to know it and, trust me here, you'll enjoy it more the les you know. I will tell you - and this should not give anything away - that people are not what they seem on the outside and just when you think you know who did it - or, in the case of this story, ""why?"", things change. There are layers to the story and they are revealed like peeling an onion. EVERY character has a fault or weakness, even those you think of as the the ""good guys"". Remember that this is not the story of a crime squad. This is a police division that investigates internal affairs and crimes committed by other officers.

The newest actress in this series - Keeley Hawes - is apparently a well known British TV actress, though I can't remember ever seeing her before. She has a tough role and shows lots of emotion. I was impressed. The Bonus Features are split between the Two DVDs. The  ""Extended and Deleted Scenes (30 minutes) and ""Behind the Scenes Footage (10 min)"" are on Disc ONE. There are 10 interviews with each of the major cast members and creative team. These run about 40 minutes.  But A word to the wise - Do watch the Bonuses on Disc ONE until you've seen all the episodes on Disc TWO. There are spoilers in those bonuses. Just remember to go back to Disc One to watch them.

There is an ""English Subtitles"" option which may be helpful for those not used to varying British, Scottish and Irish  accents. But - though I often use the subtitles, I didn't need them this time.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful to this point. NOW for a POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT! STOP HERE if you want no surprises.

Though the case here is basically solved and most of the criminals are apprehended. The scriptwriter does not tie up all loose ends.  There are epilogue notes on the screen at the end acknowledging this, but there are no purposeful ""cliffhangers"" that would be resolved in the next season. Hence, I was left unfulfilled, hoping for all the answers.  If you like things all wrapped up, you may be disappointed. I though the acting and characters were worth the time watching this but I can't gave it the five stars that Series 1 (which I called ""the best yet from Acorn"") received from me.

6122240,5,B00GWXI2EU,"This is one of the most complex mystery/suspense/thriller series I have ever viewed.
6 stars for AC-12 (anti-corruption unit). You may turn your head from graphic scenes, but you can't stop viewing. Action has grit, writing layered, actors believably tough. Another BBC hit with a dark side.
The story evolves like a 6 hour hi-suspense feature rather than individual episode series. Well-developed plot, sub-plots, and characters that remain edge-of-the-seat scary for hours and keep you guessing. Not for kids. A nightmare producer if there ever was one. Relationships create many sub-plots.

Keeley Hawes (`Upstairs, Downstairs' `Wives & Daughters'), is new as DI Lindsay Denton. Returning boss is DS Hastings (Adrian Dunbar). DCC Dryden (Mark Bonnar) new, also all episodes. DC Fleming (Vicky McClure), Cottan (Craig Parkinson), DS Arnott (Martin Compston -`Monarch of the Glen') also returns. Top acting makes it all seem real.

SDH SUBTITLES provided in all 6 episodes. My wife and I could not stop watching between episodes.
A police convoy ambush kills all but DI Denton. How did anyone but DCC Dryden know the route? Fleming gets replaced early as partner of Arnott by DC Trotman (Jessica Raine -`Call the Midwife') as the AC-12 team investigates a suspected cop internal leak. Denton's reassigned, being suspect, to missing persons division. With Major Violent Crime cops also into the mix, who will cover who's back? Some officers' reputations take a hit when the dead witness identity is revealed. Is there an honest copper left to ID those bent? Cops who are assigned to nick bent cops have a nasty job.",1407283200,2,1615,5.183908045977011
6122241,5,B00GWXI2EU,"Season 2 of Line of Duty offers a fresh new story but the same ethosa culture of corruption investigated by the Anti-Corruption unit, which is itself beset by human weakness and ongoing temptations.  Conflict is everywhere, conflict marked by moral ambiguity, conflict that torments the characters who would be heroic and seems to barely touch those who are villains to the core.

The story: DI Lindsay Denton, a desk jockey, finds herself as duty officer in a crisis.  A person in the witness protection program is mortally threatened and his handler, a police officer, calls out to DI Denton for help.  She wants to transport the witness to a safe haven.  As the process unfolds the mini-convoy is ambushed.  Police officers die and the witness barely escapes with his life (at least for the moment).

DI Denton (Keeley Hawes in an absolutely virtuoso performance) is immediately suspected of complicity in the ambush, though she professes her innocence.  As the investigation proceeds she appears, by turns, to be either a brave copper or a conniving monster, perhaps a little of both.

Without revealing too much of the plot, the viewer must know that incidents and characters in season 2 link directly to incidents and characters in season 1.  As season 1 ended with an utterly bleak world largely bereft of hope, season 2 suggests (in its plot arcs) that justice might be restored or at least trotted out for a brief moment or two.  Thus, season 2 intensifies the ethos depicted in season 1.

At one point DI Denton proclaims the nature of that ethos.  Everyone in the force above the rank of DCI, she tells us, is a politician rather than a policeman.  Imagine an army consisting of Iagos and Lady Macbeths in all of the senior leadership positions, or, to a degree, the LAPD as imagined and depicted by James Ellroy.

Again, the performances are exquisite, the writing taut, the plot riveting.  There are 6 hour-long episodes, one more than in season 1.  This is a don't miss, but you should see the seasons in order.  The striking thing is that while there are a few moments of slam-bang violence the vast majority of the series consists of intellection, interrogation and reflection.  The episodes are ultimately very talky but, at the same time, spellbinding.  Do not plan to watch an episode a night.  Youll want to see the full series in one sitting.",1405641600,16,2363,4.7995049504950495

8628125,5,B00GWXI2EU,"I've got the first 4 series, which I am right now watching for the second time in a row (because there's so much excellent action and dialogue in them) to catch anything I missed the first time round.  And, yes, I did miss many subtle looks, words and movements.  I began with series 1 and  2, and was so impressed and enthralled, that I immediately ordered series 3 and 4.  All I can say at this point is that I hope there will be a series 5 and 6.",1514851200,,449,4.01123595505618
8628126,5,B00GWXI2EU,"Amazing series. I was a bit upset to see Series 4 is not included with Prime or Acorn TV, but I am also a Hulu subscriber and it's on there.",1514678400,,140,3.7
8628127,5,B00GWXI2EU,"Totally addictive. Set aside some time and get somewhere without too many distractions because you want to catch all the dialogue. Complex but delightful plot twists. This thing is taut, thrilling and a non stop roller coaster ride. The entire series including Series 4 is better than almost anything on television. I also recommend the series: Shadowline and Shades of Blue. Enjoy.",1513382400,,382,5.17741935483871
