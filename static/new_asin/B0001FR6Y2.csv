8156849,5,B0001FR6Y2,"The Day the Loving Stopped is a 1981 made for television movie starring Dennis Weaver, Valerie Harper, Dominique Dunne  and Ally Sheedy. Based upon the book by Julie Autumn List, the movie is about Judy Danner (Dominique Dunne), a young woman who has series doubts about marrying her boyfriend as she has never recovered from the divorce of her parents, Aaron (Dennis Weaver) and Norma (Valerie Harper). Adding to her doubts about whether love can truly last is the fact that after their divorce, Aaron and Norma's future relationships also failed. The Day the Loving Stopped is a really well made movie from the golden age of television movies. It really showcases the talent of the future Poltergeist co-star Dominique Dunne and her amazing potential as an actress. Potential sadly never realized as the cute Dominique was stranged to death by her ex-boyfriend in October 1982. The Day the Loving Stopped also features an early role for Ally Sheedy, the future co-star of The Breakfast Club and Wargames. The only negative thing I found about The Day the Loving Stopped was Valerie Harper. There is just something about her acting that makes Norma difficult to like. Valerie's acting is basically lifeless. As The Day the Loving Stopped has never been released on DVD, old VHS copies are criminally over priced. It would be worth your money though.",1464652800,,1350,4.947136563876652
