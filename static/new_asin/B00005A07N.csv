7934642,3,B00005A07N,It's been quite some time that I have watched this.  Therefore I can't really elaborate on it.,1455148800,,94,4.529411764705882
7934643,3,B00005A07N,"I purchased this double feature a few years ago mainly for Lady Frankenstein and buried it away. Going through my DVD collection years later, I realized I never saw Tormented and decided to give it a viewing. The most interesting detail is that I did not fall asleep while viewing (must be all the coffee). The plot was pretty dull. Carlson kills his former jealous girlfriend at a lighthouse and is pursued by her ghost throughout the rest of the film. He is then plagued by cheesy special effects as he attempts to prepare for his wedding. Throw in some bribery and suspicious family members of the bride and you pretty much get the idea. Not many good laughs in this one except for a disembodied head yelling at the main character on occasion. Great idea for the DVD setup includes drive-in commercials and movie previews wedged between the two films. However, the image quality is poor, but for the cheap price it's not a bad deal. If you are just buying this for Lady Frankenstein, you may want to investigate other options.",1167609600,,1029,4.628415300546448
7934644,3,B00005A07N,"Tormented is one of the more interesting of the old black and white horror movies, though not one of the scariest.

Richard Carlson (It Came From Outer Space, Riders To The Stars)  is planning to get married on a small island, but his old girlfriend confronts him in the lighthouse, threatening to spoil his new relationship, insisting she still wants him.  When the railing breaks and she falls, he has a chance to save her life and pull her back up, but sees a chance to solve his problem and lets her fall to her death in the ocean below.

Throughout the rest of the movie the ghost of the woman haunts him - you see her footprints in the sand, her disembodied hand and then head - while he tries to go through with his wedding.  But that's not all - the plot takes some interesting turns as the sailor who brought the old girlfriend to the island schemes blackmail, then the ghost taunts Carlson into murdering him, but his fiancee's sweet little sister is watching.

Unfortunately to me the ghostly gimmicks weren't scary.  Perhaps I've seen too many more effective horror movies.  But the story was interesting anyway.

Lady Frankenstein  is certainly interesting to horror fans, but not suitable for the whole family.  Joseph Cotten (Shadow Of A Doubt, Niagra, From The Earth To The Moon, etc.) plays Frankenstein in the first half of the film.  After his monster kill him, his daughter takes over, planning to create a husband with the brain of her father's assistant, who loves her, in a more masculine body.  It's very R-rated, not as bad as Flesh For Frankenstein, but with significant nudity and gross gruesome morbid monster assembly. The VHS box incorrectly listed ""James Cotten.""  Perhaps Joseph Cotten wouldn't mind.

I'd give Tormented 4 stars because I like the story, even if it didn't come off scary.  I'd only give Lady Frankenstein 2 stars because is seems like a bunch of cheap exploitation, common in the early 70s when they were testing what they could get away with using the new rating system.  Also they were put together cheaply by Madacy, so I'm only giving the whole package 3 stars.",1126396800,4,2114,4.685636856368563
7934645,4,B00005A07N,"Let me first state that I love these kind of movies. If you're gonna pop this disc in your player and expect ""SCREAM"", ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER"", or any other somewhat recent horror movie, you're in for a Lady Frankenstein slap to the face. These movies are viewable only by fans who appreciate how bad/good they really are, and these fans know what I am talking about. For [the price] this disc is worth it. The movies are very fun and entertaining, and Lady Frankenstein showing a little skin to get her ways sets the standard for the classic ""nudity for no reason rule"" that we all love in our cheesy horror movies. It's presented in a drive-in double feature with trailers and an intermission cartoon, it's actually pretty cool. The only thing I can gripe about is that the quality of the film transfer can be very poor at times. Obviously not from a master soure, but hey it's 2 tasteless horror flicks for [a good price]. I am glad with this purchase. Enjoy cheese horror fans!",1021420800,4,991,4.480662983425415
7934646,4,B00005A07N,"Imagine a role-reversed ""Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" if the ghost were played by Jayne Mansfield's long-lost sister, and you'll have Juli Reding as ""Vi Mason"" in the trashy Bert I. Gordon film, ""Tormented"". Gordon also gave us such trash classics as the giant locust classic ""The Beginning of The End"", and ""The She Creature."" ""She Creature""'s title character looks like a lobster Jayne Mansfield, complete with stringy blond hair and enormous rock-like breasts. Another Gordon opus,""Picture Mommy Dead"", features Don Ameche, haunted by the ghost of Zsa Zsa Gabor (no, I'm not kidding!) Mr. Gordon unleashed ""Tormented"" in 1960. Richard Carlson, who definitely was on a career nosedive, plays Tom Stewart, ""famous jazz pianist."" Stewart is spending the summer on an unnamed island, and is engaged to marry society deb ""Meg"", played by Lugene Sanders. However, two-timer Stewart has to contend with his jealous, blonde and VERY buxom girlfriend Vi, who vows never to let him go, definitely putting a kink in the wedding plans. Conveniently, Stewart allows top-heavy Vi to topple to her death from the top of a deserted lighthouse. The remainder of the film consists of Vi's ghost nagging the hell out of Stewart, who also murders the sleazy skipper of a chartered boat who threatens to blackmail him. And just wait til you see what happens at the wedding! The film is very cheaply produced, replete with cheesy ""special effects"", which consist of Vi's ""footseps"" in the sand, ala ""She Creature"", and her disembodied, ghostly hand and head which tactlessly pop up at the most inconvenient times. My favorite scene features Vi's disembodied head, screaming ""Tom Stewart killed me! Tom Stewart killed me!"" over and over again! There are also, if you listen closely, snippets of music from William Castle's ""House on Haunted Hill"" in there, too. The print quality is ok, not great, but hey, for this price, who's complaining? I haven't built up enough courage to sit through ""Lady Frankenstein"" yet, but I'm sure, after a cocktail or two, it's at least good for a few laughs. Any film that has Joseph Cotten AND Mickey Hargitay in it MUST be a camp. There are also the original trailers for both flicks on this DVD, along with a cartoon, just like the good old days when you'd go to your local neighborhood ""dump"" and spend an afternoon, munching away on popcorn and nonpareils. This ""Drive-In"" series is manna for trash film lovers like myself. They bring back very pleasant memories of my childhood, when junk like this actually used to scare me!",999734400,10,2536,4.941451990632318
7934647,3,B00005A07N,"Another bad DVD double feature featuring two movies that are better off not seen.  Joseph Cotton is billed as ""James"" Cotton on the case. (?)
