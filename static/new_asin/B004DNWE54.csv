The disc is not as good as her book in my opinion, but the information is still good!",1297036800,13,257,4.543478260869565

8425742,4,B004DNWE54,"Benjamin Disraeli married a woman with white hair, and he told her he married her for her money.  Within 2 years, he told her he would have married her for her.  How did she do that?  She gave him a quiet place to live, was always pleasant...  and was very low maintenance.  Women want the perfect guys they read about in the WomenPorn called Romance Novels.  Men like that don't exist.  Men already know that women settle.  The guy they had the great sex with- the tennis instructor, whatever, who was a bad boy, but didn't make much money- that's not the guy they marry.  No, they settle.  American women are generally very high maintenance, and low to zero reward.  It's like having a car that you have to tinker with daily, to keep running.  I have known more than 100 men, above 38, who will never, ever get married again, due to what the ex put them through.  Men who have intuition, and some do, feel these women out, and cloak up in invisibility to them.  Settling.  Yeah.  Which means they will try to trade up.  Women don't seem to understand that when they gut a man, and hang him up to bleed out in divorce court, that he's kind of messed up for the next woman... assuming he even wants another woman.  As a book, this isn't bad- the time to settle though, is not 35+, it's more like 28.  Tom Leykis put out some magic phrases to get and stay married: stay thin, long hair, sex on request, speak sparingly and pleasantly, smile often.  Foreign women often understand this.  Walk the streets of France, or Spain, or Italy, see how women dress.  Women are hot into their 60's in those countries, I mean hot.  There are 80 year old women in France who dress well, and know how to run the vibes, and have lovers.  One of the most fascinating things I've ever seen is feminists hit on men.  Huh?  Those men know they are FishBicycle candidates.  They just say no.  They know what kind of toxic futures these womyn offer.  Black people know to avoid triple K functions, and smarter men know to avoid feminists, in the same way.  And for those who would object to this, what you are saying sounds like the poo-pooing of BLM, for black people.  It is so easy for men to rate women.  They see how much women respect them.  Zero respect = crummy prospect.  I know a guy who is 50.  His wife dumped him, got custody of the kids, bled him out, and so on.  He got custody of his kids, because she neglected them.  He won't ever even get engaged, no, he just wants sex.  This book is useful- it just needs to go farther.",1519084800,,2518,4.301282051282051

8425744,5,B004DNWE54,I watched it a couple of years ago and I was not married within a year but that might have more to do with the user than the advice. This time I hope it helps me get married or at least off Tinder for a bit.,1474934400,,207,3.5217391304347827
