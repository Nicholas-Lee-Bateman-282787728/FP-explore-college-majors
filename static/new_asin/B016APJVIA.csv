7466070,2,B016APJVIA,"I don't usually write reviews of movies, but I feel compelled to write one for this movie because it was a disappointment. Other reviews had spoke of on screen chemistry and true friendship between the two lead female protagonists, and I was excited to see that.

In particular, and in addition, I wanted to see a cool single woman in her thirties with her proverbial sh!# together. This movie does NOT have that. Instead, it has what I previously thought of as a Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG)... I went to Wikipedia to confirm what a MPDG is, and this is not quite that. Specifically, there is not a male love interest... But FWIW there is a person being inspired by Brooke's manic dreams and her loquaciousness.

I think one review described Brooke as an interior designer, but she is more of an ""internet famous"" renaissance woman. I have ""internet famous"" friends who definitely have their act together, but the -in this case- cliched choice of career seems to be pushing the character toward a blend of unsavory tropes.

I really wanted to like this film. I had a love affair with New York, and when I went to visit my friend from college who had ""made it,"" I remember being so impressed by her ability to enjoy that amazing city. I wanted to be inspired to travel... to advance. I wanted to like both of the female protagonists. Instead, I cringed.

The other female characters in the story are equally cringe-worthy. (Nicolette and Mamie-Claire)

Perhaps the only semi-like-able character was Tony.

Maybe there is a meta-point about Woody Allen movies being made here. (Or maybe this is MPDG ""grown up"" with a little sister.) I am not sure, but I felt that fans of strong female characters should be at least be warned.",1448841600,4,1727,4.6644736842105265

An anxious and lonely young college student gets caught up in the glamorous, exciting yet deluded plans of her older, soon-to-be step sister (Greta Gerwig).

What did I think?

A slick and polished script sweeps the audience along in a whirlwind adventure between two women. The plot gathers pace and keeps unfolding with vigor, driving home the themes of growing up, fitting in, and accepting that dreams require hard work and perseverance, not just rich friends.

This film, set in NYC, is pure delight filled with witty dialogue, likeable characters, and relatable themes. By the end, you're compelled to cheer on each character and wish them all well. Intriguing and captivating.",1446163200,,700,5.114035087719298
7466075,5,B016APJVIA,"Noah Baumbach is a rare writer/director that has made movies Ive both loved and hated. Here are two prime examples. My initial viewing of his fantastic Frances Ha - which I was lucky enough to enjoy in a theater - was one of the most transformative movie-going experiences Ive had to date. I remember that it made me passionate about film in a summer that was full of forgettable movies, and it continues to further my love for the art form as I watch it again and again. While Were Young (released earlier this year), on the other hand, I found to be incredibly bothersome and even laughable at times. I sat in the theater waiting for the credits to roll, and it was as far from an enjoyable movie experience as can be. Having these completely opposite reactions to his work, and many more mixed feelings on his other films, I wasn't sure what Id think of Mistress America. Fortunately, it was one of the most vibrant and genuinely funny films Ive seen in a very long time.

The picture centers around the relationship between two soon-to-be sisters (or stepsisters for that matter), played by Lola Kirke and Greta Gerwig. One of which is a lonely college freshman whos quite timid when it comes to actively pursuing her dream of becoming a writer, and the other being a thirty year-old adventurous interior designer whos notorious for entangling others in her own crazy schemes. They both live in New York City and feel obligated to meet at least once considering the fact that their respective parents will be marrying, and we see their relationship grow considerably in a very short time.

Kirke and Gerwig have this undeniable on-screen chemistry that could only be the product of a real-life friendship. Its clear that they're the ones driving the film forward. Greta Gerwig, whos credited as a co-writer on both this project and Frances Ha, shows off her comic ability beautifully. Its no coincidence that Baumbachs best films have starred and been co-written by her. Shes quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses working today, and this film perfectly shows why.",1445126400,14,2075,4.777158774373259
7466076,4,B016APJVIA,"""Mistress America"" (2015 release; 84 min.) brings the story of Brooke (played by Greta Gerwig) and Tracy (played by Lola Kirke), whose respective dad and mom are about to marry, making them 'sisters-to-be'. As the movie opens, we see Tracy starting college, and not adjusting very well. After some urging from here mom, Tracy finally connects with Brooke, a 30 yr. old single woman who seemingly has it all, or at least a whole lot. Her latest venture is to start a 'neighborhood restaurant' that combines eating, clothes-shopping and hanging out, but Brooke needs investors to put up the start-up funds. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: a couple of years ago, Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig teamed up for a comedy-drama called ""Frances Ha"", which I thought was one of the very best movies of that year. Baumbach and Gerwig (also partners in real life) now come back with a new slice of life in New York. Baumbach and Gerwig co-wrote the film, with Baunbach also directing and of course Gerwig in the lead role. As you see some of the scenes, you cannot help but think back how this team reminds you of the Woody Allen-Diane Keaton screwball comedies from the 1970s. Same type of vibe, and so easy to watch and enjoy. But wait! there is so much more! Lola Kirke as the 18 yr. old Tracy is nothing short of a revelation, and she almost (but just not quite) steals the movie from Gerwig. (Tidbit of trivia: Lola Kirke is the daughter of Simon Kirke, the erstwhile drummer in Bad Company, and Free before that.) The interaction between Gerwig and Krike is what carries this movie into excellence (Tracy, commenting to Brooke: ""I am so impressed, and so worried, by you.) The writing is crisp, and being at just under an hour and a half, the movie flies by in no time. Frankly, I was not ready to say goodbye to these characters! Please note that the music is top notch, both the musical score from Dean & Britta, as well as the song placements throughout the movie.

The movie finally opened about a month ago, and I couldn't wait to check it out. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, although I had expected an even larger crowd, to be honest. If you liked ""Frances Ha"", you absolutely will love this one too. For those that didn't see ""Frances Ha"" and/or are on the fence about checking out ""Mistress America"", I would strongly encourage you to take a chance on this. I think that more likely than not, you will come away from this with a smile on your face. ""Mistress America"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1444262400,4,2688,4.54020618556701
7466077,4,B016APJVIA,"Theatrical review.  This is the third film paring of director/writer Noah Baumbach and writer/actress Greta Gerwig to go along with their real life coupling.  So they have things pretty much in synch, it would seem.  This film takes place in New York (of course) for the most part.  As Baumbach has done in the past, the city, especially Manhattan is a character in the film.  Greta (who played Lola in Lola Verses) is Brooke, a 30 year old gadfly who lives in the city and talks constantly, especially about things shes done or is about to do.  Shes energetic, articulate and a bit annoying.  Her widowed father is about to marry a divorced woman whose daughter is just starting college at Barnard/Columbia in the city.

Tracy (Lola Kirke, who played Greta in Gone Girl) is not terribly comfortable with the change and struggles to make friends at the snooty school.  At the suggestion of her mother, Tracy calls Brooke while bored out of her mind.  They meet and immediately strike up a friendship that belies their age difference.  Tracy thinks Brooke is the coolest person, loves her approach to life and is enthralled to hear about her plans for a restaurant.  A bit of a running gag is Tracy constantly asking Brooke if she can be a waitress at the restaurant when it opens, and Brooke ignoring her each time.

The film doesnt have much of a plot.  Its a character driven story.  Brookes boyfriend (never seen) decides against financing the restaurant, so Brooke approaches an old boyfriend and his wife, an old friendship gone sour.  Tracy and Brooke bring along another college couple because the guy has a car and the girl is jealous of Tracy.  Once inside the wealthy Greenwich-based couples (Michael Chernus and Heather Lind) house, the film takes a very stagy look and feel.  Even minor characters get little snippets of dialog, while at the time you are wondering why are they even here.  The dialog is snappy and fresh and I really liked Kirkes take on the student/wannabee writer.  The movie is funny, but one where youll be smiling not laughing out loud.  Recommended.",1444262400,9,2084,4.749303621169917

7466085,5,B016APJVIA,"What starts out seeming like a broad shallow glorification of two spoiled and self indulgent women in NYC slowly becomes a very subtle demystification of them.  The young college freshman has her age as an excuse.  Her 30 year old soon to be step-sister is a classic case of arrested development, possibly due to a distant critical father and a mother who slowly died of cancer.  The two take a road trip to an ex-boyfriend's mansion in the car of an annoying college couple seeking a desperate last ditch investment for her ill conceived restaurant startup.  This is where the quirky dialogue is allowed to go all over the map.  What I like about this film is that it keeps it's aims and focus very small.  Even in the final scene, it is clear these two women are not likely to change anyone's world.  In that way, it is sort of an ""anti chick flick"" without judging, pandering, or condescending to it's subjects.",1465689600,3,914,4.570552147239264

Her character was interesting, for lack of a better word, and I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off.

Greta G. is the ultimate trainwreck of a big sister that everyone wishes for, but possibly no one more than someone stuck at stuffy Barnard College. The scene in the bar when an old schoolmate confronts her is just classic -- we feel guilty for loving her but we can't help it -- kind of like Withnail, and if you know who Withnail is, you know just what I mean. Why was this not nominated for anything?

It's a wonderful film for anyone who loves Greta Gerwig or ""Frances Ha"". It's got that same quirky, lovable, curl up with a cuppa something wonderful and spend an evening engrossed in film quality.

7466108,2,B016APJVIA,"My initial reaction is... I'm too old for this story or its point of view. I can't say that I don't get it. Maybe I understood too much. It contained every thought and inclination I ever had in puberty, but dumped because they were too crazy or lacking value to pursue.

I thought the story would actually lead somewhere and or make me feel something, but alas I felt nearly nothing, and can't say it helped me to understand anything. It did make me laugh on a few occasions, but not from a deft twist of irony on a point of truth. My laughter came from disbelief that anyone might propose such ideas, expecting me to laugh with them, and not at them.

I didn't hate it, as evidenced by the two stars. But as I said above, I'm too old to like anything offered by the story. The acting might have been what the creators wanted, but for me, the story was too flawed for brilliant acting to save it... not saying that any of the acting was brilliant, but who am I to judge?

There is a famous saying that originates from Anton Chekhov that is commonly used in film schools: ""show don't tell."" This picture breaks that simple saying in almost all of its lines, as characters will just randomly blurt out how they feel - all while keeping a neutral look on their face.

Baumbach has also made a living out of his quick wit and intellectual humor, but unfortunately in ""Mistress America,"" he decided to throw intellect out the window.

There are a few redeeming factors: its Woody Allen-esque use of camera-work, fitting choice of music, and easy to like characters.

Though it doesn't live up to his previous films, ""Mistress America"" should be watched by Baumbach fans. If you don't like him, you won't like this; and if you haven't seen his other work, I recommend you watch that instead.",1497225600,3,890,4.842105263157895

8736101,1,B016APJVIA,"What happened to Noah ? Multi untalented Greta has stolen his vision, this whole movie is a mess where's his wit, gone.",1484352000,,119,4.454545454545454
8736102,3,B016APJVIA,"Have you ever watched a movie that you were really enjoying and then at a certain point towards the end thought 'Wait, what happened to this movie?""? There were a lot of humorous moments throughout the first half of the movie, but the second half devolves into self-absorbed nonsense, including the final 20 minutes or so, which are like a crappy stage play starring Greta Gerwig playing... the same character she plays in every movie.

Noah Baumbach is one of the most talented screenwriters alive. I'm not sure what happened here - it's like he had half a script and rather than set it aside to finish later, he just made the movie and told the actors to improvise their way through the end.",1484179200,4,693,4.588709677419355
