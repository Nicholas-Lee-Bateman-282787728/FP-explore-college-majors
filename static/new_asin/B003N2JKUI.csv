8400618,4,B003N2JKUI,"I really like this movie. The film quality is mediocre, but it's a movie I really enjoy. I'm a Conrad Nagel fan and he does very well in this film. The story of him losing everything that is dear to him and of the woman who loves him through it all is also well done. If the film quality was better, I would have given this 5 stars. If you are a fan of 30's drama films (and if you don't mind putting up with mediocre film quality), then I think you will enjoy this movie.",1372809600,,472,3.9270833333333335
