Both actors are fantastic. It stars Bette Davis with Ernest Harden Jr.,  It is a movie about friendship.  I have watched it three times.  Cry still, because it is that good.  Genuine.",1520640000,,274,4.448979591836735

8014400,1,B0001M7N16,Has anyone looked at the prices for this classic Bette Davis movie. I am a huge Bette Davis fan and of course was glad to see that this movie was available to add to my collection...but after i looked at the prices i strongly doubt that its going to happen anytime soon. $128 and more wow... even for a classic lie this and for Bette i wouldnt pay that price.. Hopefully it was just an error and will be lowered soon so that fans of the iconic Ms. Davis can add this much overlooked treasure to their collection. The 1 star is for the price not for the dvd itself or the films quality..If the price were lowered I'd give the product 5 stars,1349308800,3,640,4.169354838709677
8014401,5,B0001M7N16,"Perhaps one of Bette Davis' best TV performances and certainly a winner for her very talented co-star, Ernest Harden, Jr. A touching story of two people who were regarded as cast-offs by society supporting and loving one another.  I cry each time I watch this movie and wonder once again what our world would be like if we truly took care of one another.  I highly recommend this movie.",1327708800,6,386,4.579710144927536
8014402,5,B0001M7N16,"A proud widow, A frightened homeless kid. Nobody cared about them until they cared enough to fight for each other.

This heartwarming story about hope, is set in New York City's slums. As a penniless widow, Bette Davis takes in a black juvenile ""BT."" for the support money it will bring. She teaches him responsibility, dignity and pride, while he teaches her street savvy, survival and grit. Together they find a mutual trust and respect and the importance of counting on each other.",1136851200,6,484,4.831325301204819
