4911607,5,B005ZVINLM,"I had another good treat tonight when I watched my favorite William Powell along with Jean Harlow in Reckless. Oh how I do adore William Powell. If only I had been years older or him younger - woowoo. He's my man. Jean Harlow was beautiful and I thought she did a super good job in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely but of course I would love anything William Powell was in! The movie actually had a good plot and was quite interesting. I liked the horse racing scene and I liked the dance scenes as well. The clothes were beautiful, too. Old movies are the best. I am always happy with the right man gets the right girl, too, so that worked out well for me. It was just a darn good movie in my opinion.",1437004800,3,704,4.145985401459854

4911610,5,B005ZVINLM,"Great movie!  Not really a musical, but more of a drama, for it's time the story line is quite bold, featuring suicide and the rich versus poor societal struggle that still exists today. Love William Powell and Jean Harlow together. Too bad in real-life Jean unexpectedly died before she and Powell could marry.",1422057600,2,311,4.867924528301887
4911611,4,B005ZVINLM,"MGM tried their best to showcase the great Jean Harlow in a musical film, but it didn't work one hundred percent of the way. Trouble was, while Jean was an excellent actress, she couldn't really sing (she does indeed ""talk sing"" a few of her lines in a song while the rest of the song is dubbed almost certainly by Eadie Adams) and Jean couldn't dance very well, either. Just as another reviewer notes, Jean is often photographed during her dance scenes from the waist up; and it's pretty obvious that a double us being used in certain camera shots from a distance so the audience can't tell Harlow's not really dancing in that number. Nevertheless, I did admire and appreciate just how well Jean Harlow acts in this film; her acting performance is quite convincing and I give her a gold star for ""hanging in there"" during what must have been a rough patch when someone in the film (I won't say who) kills themselves; this is not unlike Jean's late husband Paul Bern killing himself in real life and MGM wasn't kind at all to put Jean in a film with that type of scenario. Perhaps as some others have said MGM was trying to ""cash in"" on Harlow's personal life with Paul Bern not to mention the real life Libby Holman scandal in Hollywood which was still relatively fresh in people's minds.

On the brighter side, however, the choreography and cinematography overall reflect good forethought and the use of lighting does a great job of capturing the emotions on the actors faces and even setting the tone for each scene. The casting was very well done; the other actors give very fine performances and the sets were also quite good.

When the film starts, we quickly meet Broadway ""showgirl"" Mona Leslie (Jean Harlow) who is gets bailed out of jail (for reckless driving) so she can get to the theater where she is due to perform for a benefit of some sort--Mona's friend, sports promoter Ned Riley (William Powell), bails her out at least so Mona can do the show before possibly doing even more jail time! Interestingly enough, the ""benefit"" turns out to be for the exclusive delight of wealthy playboy Bob Harrison (Franchot Tone) who has bought every seat in the theater so he can have the performance--with Mona in it--all to himself! Bob woos Mona even though Ned loves Mona too and eventually Bob and Mona elope and wed much to the chagrin of Bob's stuffy, old-fashioned father Colonel Harrison (Henry Stephenson). Bob's fiance Josephine ""Jo"" Mercer (a young Rosalind Russell in a great performance) accepts Bob's marrying Mona graciously and Jo even gets along with Bob's new wife Mona.

Unfortunately, things in the Harrison household just aren't going well now that Bob and Mona are married. There's more to the plot than just this--and I've already left out some detail to avoid spoiling it all for you--but suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything plays out for all the characters.

Look also for solid performances by the wonderful May Robson as ""Granny;"" Ted Healy as ""Smiley;"" Nat Pendleton as ""Blossom;"" a young Mickey Rooney as Eddie; Allan Jones as Allan; Allen ""Farina"" Hoskins as horse jockey ""Gold Dust"" and if you look closely you'll see Charles Middleton in an uncredited role as a district attorney.

True, Reckless doesn't exactly show off Jean Harlow as a musical star who could dance--but then again her acting skills were so great I enjoyed the movie anyway! I recommend this film for fans of all the actors in it. People who like dramas with some musical numbers from the golden age of Hollywood may also want this in their collections despite the fact that someone ""fills in"" for Jean Harlow for the better part of those song and dance numbers.",1397174400,7,3696,4.688751926040061
4911612,3,B005ZVINLM,"I love Jean Harlow and William Powell in just about anything. Reckless is not bad as a melodrama...but it stinks as a musical. However, Harlow and Powell still manage to shine in this over the top David O. Selznick production. MGM thought putting Jean Harlow in a musical would add dimensions to her career. Wrong. After, ""Reckless"" it was decided to leave the singing to the birds and Jeannette McDonald. Harlow can't sing. She talk sings part of "" Reckless""....but even dubbing doesn't help. The musical numbers are bizarre. Harlow can't dance either !  She skips, waves, kicks, but never gets off the ground. She is the only star in a musical photographed above the waist in her dance numbers. Body shots. Long shots with dance doubles filling in for her. Any close ups of dancing feet aren't Harlow's. MGM writers capitalized on the Libby Holman scandal of the 1930's. Libby's young husband, heir to the Reynold's, tobacco fortune committed suicide under mysterious circumstances.  MGM patterned  ""Reckless"" on this.  Nevertheless, I like this movie...in spite of the awful, unintentionally funny musical numbers.  It has a strong supporting cast. Harlow and Powell are good together.",1390262400,5,1188,5.103092783505154
4911613,4,B005ZVINLM,"We are fans of William Powell. In this filmed story, he is the watchful, constant, faithful friend to Jean Harlow's character. This story is a beautiful demonstration of what love really is. Well acted by all. The four stars is because this is an old film. Modern viewers may object to the lack of bells and whistles in the special effects and photography department.",1381795200,7,367,4.75
4911614,5,B005ZVINLM,A good old movie that works today. Old movies had great casts todays movies usually have one big star and a bunch of people you never heard of.,1370995200,3,143,4.142857142857143
4911615,3,B005ZVINLM,"Contrary to popular belief ""Reckless"" was not based on Jean Harlow's life, but on the life of Libby Holman, a famous 20s torch singer. Holman was enthusiastically romanced by and ultimately married a rich tobacco heir (son of R.J. Reynolds) in 1931. She got pregnant and eventually had a son, but prior to that, Reynolds died of a gunshot and Holman and her manager (there were rumors of romantic involvement) were accused of murder, although the ME eventually ruled it a suicide. The scandal remained with Holman and her career suffered.

Interestingly enough, Holman was well known for her song ""Moanin' Low"" and the main character in ""Reckless"" is ""Mona Leslie"", played by Harlow. Unfortunately, Harlow's second husband, MGM producer Paul Bern, was found dead from a gunshot in 1932, and his death was ruled a suicide. So having Harlow appear in a feigned biography of Holman was certainly bad taste, but the story itself was not based on Harlow's life. In fact, the scandal had already been filmed twice (""Brief Moment"", ""Sing Sinner Sing"").

24-year old Jean Harlow (1911-1937) was the biggest sex symbol of her times. Only Marilyn Monroe in the 50s ever achieved a rival position. Harlow began by playing gangster's moll (""The Secret Six"", ""Public Enemy"", ""Scarface"", ""Beast of the City"") and moved to more complex roles in ""Red Dust"" (1932) and ""Three Wise Girls"" (1932) and then dabbled as a comedienne in ""Red Headed Woman"" (1932). By 1935 she was a fully fledged movie actress and one of MGM biggest superstars. So now her MGM bosses decided to make her a singing/dancing star as well.

They're not entirely successful. The few songs that Harlow actually sings are convincing enough that her future was in acting, not singing, although her dancing has a certain 30s abandon that I found very attractive. There is a double in some of the more demanding dance routines, but most of the time you're watching Harlow and she is a delight.

FWIW - Apparently the film was originally shot as a straight drama, and the musical numbers were later inserted.

William Powell (1892-1984) met Harlow when they filmed ""Reckless"" and they started a love affair and had plans to marry which were interrupted by Harlow's death in June 1937 during the filming of ""Saratoga"". Powell was a major star of the 30s and 40s and was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""The Thin Man"", ""My Man Godfrey"", ""Life with Father"").

Franchot Tone (1905-68) plays Harlow's ill-fated husband. Ton was a marvelous actor who is best known for his Oscar nominated performance in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935). He made nearly 100 films and gave outstanding performances in films like ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), ""The Man on the Eiffel Tower"" (1949), and ""Advise & Consent"" (1962). He co-starred with Harlow in 4  films - ""Bombshell"" (1933), ""The Girl from Missouri"" (1934), ""Reckless"" (1935), and ""Suzy"" (1936).

There is a great supporting cast with a very young Mickey Rooney, Rosalind Russell in one of her first films, Ted Healy (the originator of ""The 3 Stooges"") and Nat Pendleton as Powell's associates, Henry Stephenson as Tone's stuffy father, and May Robson as Harlow's grandma.

Victor Fleming (1889-1949) directed. Fleming is best known for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and ""GWTW"" (1939) for which he won an Oscar. He made 49 films including ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""Captains Courageous"" (1937), and ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1941). He directed Harlow in ""Red Dust"" (1932) and ""Bombshell"" (1933).

1935 was a good year for films. ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""The Informer"" were box office and Oscar winners. Other top 10 grossing films included Gable and Harlow in ""China Seas"", Flynn and de Havilland in ""Captain Blood"", Shirley Temple in ""The Littlest Rebel"" and ""Curly Top"", and Greta Garbo in ""Anna Karenina"". Other notable films released that year included ""Alice Adams"" with Hepburn, ""The 39 Steps"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""David Copperfield"", ""A Tale of Two Cities"", ""Les Miserables"", ""Top Hat"", and ""A Night at the Opera"". In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released ""Triumph of the Will"".

The NY Times called it a `stale and profitless meringue of backstage routines and high society amour"" and bemoaned ""transforming an excellent comedienne into an unconvincing song-and-dance artist."" Variety called it ""a hodge-podge of melodrama, backstage and quasi-musical"" and ""a rambling affair in toto.""

Bottom line - Fans of Jean Harlow will certainly enjoy this film, but others may find it less than enchanting.",1323475200,,4501,5.018766756032171

4911620,4,B005ZVINLM,"Directed by Victor Fleming, this Jean Harlow vehicle co-stars William Powell (Harlow's real life lover at the time) and Franchot Tone (who also co-starred with her in ""Bombshell, ""The Girl from Missouri"" and ""Suzy""). ""Reckless"" (1935) appears to be an attempt to mold the platinum bombshell into a singing and dancing vamp- talents Harlow did not possess. The film itself has many flaws and is not considered Harlow's best film, but it should be noted it remains entertaining and rather poignant considering a plot-line mirrors the tragedy of Paul Berns' suicide; in reality, the film was more or less based on the then recent Libby Holman murder scandal. The film is not a comedy but a musical /drama. Harlow plays Mona Leslie, a famous and popular theatre actress who marries a troubled, rich guy Bob Harrison (Tone). Shortly thereafter, Harrison regrets his decision in marrying the young star as it causes friction and gossip within his high-class friends and family; on impulse, he ends up doing something so drastic it changes the course of Leslie's life and career. Caught in the mix is Leslie's good friend and sport's promoter Ned Riley (Powell) who has obvious feelings for her.

One of my biggest problems with this film is with some of the characters. Tone's character for instance, is badly written. He obsessively pursues Leslie, renting out an entire auditorium so he can watch her perform, goes incognito, sporting a clumsy, fake moustache just so he can have her to himself and when he finally wins her over and marries her, ends up regretting it; he belittles her in the company of his friends and snobby family and goes out of his way tomake her miserable. As written, his character is not very believable. Annoying character aside, I view this film often as it does have its merits and is a curiosity item. Harlow does a lot of singing (dubbed by Virginia Verrill) and dancing (a double was used) and since singing and dancing were not her skill set, it becomes all too obvious that the dancing vamp on stage or tap dancing in the crowded ball room, or lip-synching (and not too convincingly at times) on stage is not Harlow. However, she never looked better. If this film fails to showcase Harlow's singing and dancing abilities at least it showcases her beauty. It is at its peak in this film and is reason alone to watch this; so you can marvel at the pale, luminous, platinum goddess wearing her usual skin tight gowns and oozing on screen charisma. The extravagant opening musical number is also noteworthy and beautifully filmed; not to mention the songs are quite lovely and the last scene in the film, with Mona alone on stage demanding respect, is exquisitely acted by Harlow.

This DVD comes with no noteworthy extras. There is simply the film's trailer and that's pretty much it. The picture quality is average; clearly there was not much of an attempt to clean it up. This film is included in the box set ""Jean Harlow 100th Anniversary Collection"" which is recommended for fans of the legendary star.

4911621,3,B005ZVINLM,"As a period piece this was worth renting, but it was not one of Harlow's better films and certainly not one of William Powell's either. Poor Jean was forced to sing and dance neither of which she could do well. The dubbing of her voice was poorly done. Those scenes are painful to watch. The storyline was interesting through and the parallel between what happened in her real life marriage and what happens in this movie is of interest. Powell and Harlow have great chemistry. It's easy to believe they were a couple in real life. Rosalind Russell does a nice job as the high class ex. girlfriend of Franchot Tone. But the singing and dancing scenes are embarrassingly bad and interfere with the rest of the movie.

Jean Harlow hokds her own, but William Powell's scenes at the end of the movie are exquisite, emotional, and thoroughly satisfying. After watching My Man Godfrey, and then Reckless, he had me so completely sold that I am working my way through every Powell movie I can put my hands on, having never seen any previously.

8490013,4,B005ZVINLM,"This review contains a SPOILER. (Sorry, but there's no other way to discuss it).
This film comes with a train load of baggage that most people just watching this film no longer know about. Major film critics and fans do know most of it in detail and hold it against the film with some justification. The film is a barely disguised take on nonconformist Broadway actress Libby Holman's life, focusing on her unfortunate marriage to Zachary smith Reynolds, the R.J. Reynolds tobacco heir and his subsequent suicide. At the last minute the lead was taken from Joan Crawford and given to Jean Harlow, probably because Louis B. Mayer though its parallel with the suicide of Harlow's first husband Paul Bern two years before (quite likely actually a murder), would sell tickets. Then there was her current love relationship with star William Powell. Put it all together and it was not right to put Jean Harlow in the role at all.

But the film fails in its own way as well. For the first third it's a sparkling comedy, full of wit and great dialogue. Powell is his charming best as Ned Riley, sports promoter and Mona Leslie's (Harlow) agent. Franchot Tone (who had a real affair going with Joan Crawford) is typecast but funny as rich playboy Bob Harrison. May Robson is an absolute delight as Mona's ""Granny"", a much meatier role than her usual high society grand dame. Everything is moving along swimmingly when out of nowhere the film takes a turn and becomes a melodrama and the whole production sinks from the comedy classic it could have been. Then to add even more problems, Harlow is required to be not just an actress, which she could have handled, but a singer and dancer, which she wasn't at all. The singing is dubbed with a totally unconvincing voice, and Harlow's ""dancing"" is accomplished by doubles and closeup shots of her smiling and tossing her head. it has a few good moments but really doesn't work.

Still, I like it and gave it four stars. It's the actors. though it's a clunky melodrama, everyone gives it their best and most of the time they're really good. Harlow perfectly projects a kind of inner warmth and goodness that wins over the society people who at first reject her (and us as well). This was not an unusual role for her. Part of her charm was her ability to project charm and a good soul even as a fallen woman. Powell and Robson are especially excellent together. Tone does his best with a thankless role. The MGM character actors are as good as the always were. So there's still a lot to see here even if it is far less a production than it could have been.",1490400000,2,2592,4.572043010752688
