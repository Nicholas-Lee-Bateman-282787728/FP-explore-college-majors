(There are PAL and Region 2 DVD sets available of the other seasons but no English subtitles) Don Matteo is a parish priest in an Italian town who gets involved in one mystery after the other.

Thus far, we have watched seven episodes and the characters are well camped, believable and consistent.

3077879,5,B00126STBS,"My wife bought this for me because she heard it was the most popular TV show in Italy.  It has turned out to be quite excellent and worth the purchase.  The series is highly entertaining and pleasant to watch.  There are a number of returning characters who offer interest and change of pace as their ongoing stories evolve.  The English subtitles are well done and easily convey the story as the Italian mannerisms and body language do a great deal of the communication.  (They use their hands a lot) The plots are quite interesting and different from the rehashed American mystery themes.  The viewer gets to know the characters very well as aspects of their personality are brought out in the stories.  The humorous interplay in the Italian style is enjoyable.

The role of the priest is well played and the religious aspects are handled with respect and accuracy.  Fr. Matteo is presented as one who has a compassionate understanding and insight into the human beings that come into the story and deals with things in a humble and common sense manner.  The series is simply delightful.  My only regret is that it appears that this is the only one of the six or more seasons that is presently available in DVD.

8244290,5,B00126STBS,"My parents were born in Gubbio, Italy and i have been there a few times so I enjoyed watching this show once or twice since my cousins who lived in Rome were technicians for Lux Films and knew all the old movie stars and socialized with them.  Most of the people from Gubbio  who came to this country settled in my hometown in Pa and none were dark skin or black.  Like myself they have mostly  green or brown eyes  ...and medium brown colored hair and are light skin contrary to your reviews.  None I know where dark skinned like Latinos from Central or South America.  There definitely is a big difference in coloring and i love both.  Don Matteo definitely doesn't resemble anybody i would say comes from Gubbio.  His eyes are much to blue and his hair much to blond in addition the woman I seen on this TV program looked like she came from the Ukraine and not Gubbio.  As for the police chief he looks more Mexican then any Italian i've ever seen.  I don't think its filmed in Gubbio and I don't think the casting is authentic.  I'd like to see more improvements in the casting and scenery.  The fact that the Etruscans played an important part in its history, I think more emphasize should be placed on authentic stories then between the priesthood and police.",1427760000,,1265,4.424242424242424

Mario Girotti, whose stage name is Terrance Hill, (Don Matteo), is of German/Italian extraction. Like many Europeans, like many Northern Italians, he is of mixed parentage. That explains the blue eyes and 'natural' blond hair. I have known many Italian people here in the U.S. and not all are dark skinned and dark eyed so I am wondering where the one reviewer who is clearly prejudice against light skinned Europeans got his information from? Italian people are much like all other people around the World are.  Northern Italians have intermarried more with other ethnic groups in Europe, because they are closer to other countries in Europe than their Southern Sicilian counterparts.  Northern Italians now carry  physical traits of several ethnic groups, much like the priest,  Don Matteo, carries these physical, ethnic traits with his blue eyes and blond hair.
.
There are regular characters on Don Matteo, primarily male characters, that are dark skinned, dark eyed, and dark haired and these characters make many proud references to being Sicilian.
.
In both Europe and in the United States, Mr. Hill (Don Matteo) is an accomplished movie actor first; television acting is a more recent accomplishment for this actor.
.
I enjoy watching ""Don Matteo"" because the programs are pleasant to watch, the stories are interesting, and  always have a 'twist' at the end.  All of the characters in this series are clearly well developed, and they reflect both the ethnic, and moral makeup of  both Northern and Southern Italian peoples.

8244293,5,B00126STBS,"Okay this is most excellent. It is warm and funny as heck and still leaves you guessing ""who done it"" throughout the show.  It is about  human emotions; how people deal with difficulties (choices) It is really quite funny and I look forward to it every week.  It is refreshing - shows how to live a simple life.  And of course it is a TV show - it is entertaining",1400976000,,363,4.142857142857143
8244294,5,B00126STBS,"These dvd's offer a heart-warming storyline with engaging characters. Don Matteo is an entertaining blend of comedy, crime-solving intrigue, and romance with an uplifting message artfully inserted. Please, please find a producer who will record the rest of seasons 4 and season 5. I can't wait to see more!",1377734400,,306,5.26530612244898
8244295,4,B00126STBS,"In case you're wondering, this is not a bootleg item. This set was distributed by Ignatius Press, a prominent Catholic publisher.

For anyone who loved ""Ballykissangel,"" here is the Italian equivalent, with a helping of mystery and the occasional murder thrown in. It has some of the same gentle humor, cute dialogue, and mixture of plot elements that ""Ballykissangel"" had, but with more emphasis on mystery elements. Terence Hill is fabulous in the title role, both clever and heartwarming but not as nave as you expect a priest character to be, and only rarely sappy.

If you prefer slick noir mysteries that spew a lot of criminology at the viewer, this is not the show for you. For the rest of us, here is the dinner-friendly cousin of those darker series. It's almost not a mystery show but rather a show about a provincial town that happens to also touch on whodunit conventions. The structure of the show demands that there is usually a happy ending, or at least quite a bit of plot resolution. Yes, this show is cheesy at times, but it's cute!

I was pleased to stumble onto this show because I love hearing the Italian language and looking at the scenery, but I loathe gangster movies. Contrary to popular belief, there IS crime in Italy that has nothing to do with the mafia! Some viewers will be annoyed by the conveniently upbeat (and sometimes religious) themes of the episodes (particularly the endings), but I choose to take it for what it's worth. The main character is a priest in Italy, of course he'll talk about God sometimes! I personally enjoy them, and some have a very good point to make. Don Matteo isn't that preachy, but is eager to share his opinions. The religious themes are often an undertone and just an incidental part of the plot, so it shouldn't annoy secular viewers very much on the whole. On the other hand, it would also make for good viewing at church movie nights if you want to be a bit adventurous and pick a foreign language item that is also ""clean"" by some definitions.

This set appears to be half of season 4's episodes. I doubt it is crucial to know this (the series doesn't generally follow a serial pattern and you don't have to watch them in order), but I thought others should have a heads-up on this fact. I was not aware of this and was instead looking for a more affordable alternative to the recent MHz Networks sets, which have fewer episodes per set (but since they are entirely different episodes, let's just call this purchase a wash).

The picture quality is generally good, though the picture on a few episodes gets a bit ""jerky"" like the kind of thing you see on a DVD that was ripped from a VHS tape...a minor detail, but noticeable all the same. Again, this is a 100% legit product, but people who MUST have perfect picture every time will have to wait for MHz to release this season in a possibly better quality. I paid $30 for 12 episodes and you won't catch me whining at length about minor imperfections.

The menus are no-frills, but I don't see why they would have needed to load this set up with flashy graphics or special features. The show speaks for itself and doesn't really need interviews or commentaries.",1372550400,2,3184,4.577192982456141
8244296,2,B00126STBS,"I initially enjoyed Don Matteo, because I like mysteries, but then I noticed that the show's characters like many American shows, were getting whiter and whiter. The show is about Italians, and shortly after initial episodes, you would think that you were in Sweden. The women, like most white women these days are members of the peroxide brigade, succumbing to the Aryan concept of white and light is superior and therfore, to be sought after. The whitening of the show began with the election of the female mayor, who dresses inappropriately anyway for a mayor and is  sexually objectified-I realize sex sells and we are sold immeasurable amounts of it-rap has no monopoly on this commodity. Then one character after another had light-colored hair and olive skin began to fade in the distance. Don Matteo, himself, the star of the show, of course is light-complexioned and dyed blonde. Later, if you looked at a room full of people. you would never know you were in the Mediterranean. I know that Northen Italy has light- haired people, but also many dark people, but the show's town must have moved way up North as all the characters changed & turned real white, gradually so it became subliminal and more easily acceptable unless you have your eyes open as to media tactics and propaganda. This is not unusual, for all TV shows and movies whiten the residents , even if they come from places where brown skin and black hair is the norm. Mexican TV, all Hispanic TV looks like Spanish TV. The history of fascism in Italy and in Spain is to be noted. The need to Europeanize and bleach people is historical and hysterical. Figures from history, especially heroes, have actually beeen colored lighter and their hair changed from text to text and picture to picture until they have become acceptable-meaning white. Countries have even had white Europeans shipped in where there were too many dark-skinned people and the travel brochures, new governments, & American influences, wanted and thus created a perception of whiteness- see Professor Gates' series, ""Black in Latin America."" We are all famiiar with TV and movies that regularly kill off the black guy-who frequently dies saving the precious white woman, who survives in the end after all others have died or been killed off despite the fact that she cannot run 6 feet without falling down, but somehow manages to avoid the fire-breathing dragon, the 12 foot long claws of the monster, and the multiple explosions that rock the edifice in which all others are trapped. She has done so without getting any soot on her face, no mud after rolling down a muddy hill, and her blonde hair is perfectly coiffed and her make-up undisturbed. Black women are nowhere to be found or make a brief stereotypical appearance. In Don Matteo, whenever a blonde woman was on the screen, the light would be bright and shone directly on her with heavenly music playing. contrast this when a dark-haired woman was present. This never registers to most whites, for whom the white standard is the norm. So the fact that the show became whiter and whiter, never registered at all, thus the high rating from those who enjoy white privilege. Ignorance fails to note that 3/4 of the world's population is dark-hued and I do not mean solely African or African-American. Many Europeans, Greeks, Jews; Asians of course; nearly all Indians(from India)are dark,& native Americans before they were adulterated through assimilation. The rest of the world is whitish, but only 3% or so are really blonde. Somewhere along the line it was decided that blonde was to be promoted as ultimately desirable and of course skin color-well we all know why that became the propaganda. I no longer watch the show and do not miss it.",1369008000,3,3743,4.857589984350548
8244297,5,B00126STBS,"We love the clarity and cleanliness of these well-written, well-acted mysteries.  Our only complaint is that we can't seem to be able to get any season past season 4.  They are apparently not out on American DVD yet.  Sure would love to hear back that they are!",1368057600,,261,4.51063829787234
8244298,5,B00126STBS,"We started watching Don Mateo on MHZ TV and found ourselves preferring it to the US produced nightly oversexed dramas, so we bought this set. The characters demonstrate friendship and care while transparently expressing their frustrations in an Italian way (lots of hand waving, pointing, and intensity) that is realistic and at time humorous. We were quickly drawn into their world. Christian values are demonstrated without preachiness though I'm sure that people who don't want to have anything to do with Christian values would disagree. There is also great humor in every episode that gets better as you get to know the characters.

We find the acting to be very good. The only exception is that some of the acting by the children doesn't come out as smooth as the adults, but the adult acting makes up for it.

Unless you know Italian you have to read the subtitles, and at times they go by pretty fast, but we haven't had any problem with it.

I did find that one of the DVDs in the set seemed a little jerky and in all of them, the audio is a bit difficult to understand - like the actors are mumbling. We don't know Italian, but we're slowly learning, so I wish the sound track was a bit more crisp like the TV versions. I also wish that the sub-titles were a little more literal. It seems to paraphrase or drop words, but never-the-less the stories are clear and the plots are interesting and fun.",1338336000,8,1407,4.553359683794467
