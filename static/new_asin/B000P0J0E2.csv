2807071,5,B000P0J0E2,"Though I would agree that the sixth season marked the beginning of the end (both literally and artistically/creatively) for the TFTC franchise, there is still much to enjoy here.  The low point episode here would definitely have to be ""The Pit"" which is about as frightening or funny or clever as a Partridge Family re-run.  Without question, my least favorite episode of the first six seasons.  The 7th season is in a separate category as the series' journey across the pond rendered it a mind-numbing exercise in boredom and desperation, with only a couple of good episodes eking their way out of that uninspired bog.

Incidentally, a couple of reviewers reference Stephen Liska as the control freak on the losing side of a one night stand in ""Only Skin Deep.""  That's incorrect, that role was played by Peter Onorati.  No big whoop, I know, but just wanted to give credit where credit's due.

Personal favorites from this season are, in no particular order, as follows:

* Only Skin Deep

* Let the Punishment Fit the Crime

* Staired in Horror

* Revenge is the Nuts

* Comes the Dawn

* Doctor of Horror

And I don't care what anybody says, I like ""The Assassin"" even if it is predictable.  I love the whole Donna Reed/Susie Homemaker shtick that Shelley Hack serves up so straight-faced and the clever way everyone was ""offed."" Good fun.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Crypt-The-Complete-Sixth-Season/dp/B000P0J0E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Crypt: The Complete Sixth Season</a>",1182816000,10,1558,5.3539094650205765
2807072,3,B000P0J0E2,"The Tales From The Crypt series was some of the best television airing back in the final years of the 80s and into the early 90s. Deliberately over the top. Deliberately funny. Deliberately campy at times. Deliberately scary. Deliberately gory. Deliberately one of HBO's finest creations.

The episodes are all based on EC Comics of old...mostly from the self titled Tales From the Crypt, Haunt of Fear and Vault of Horror comic books. But I'd guess that 90% of you reading this already know that, and you're here as I am delighted that it is finally out on DVD.

For those that have not seen these wonderfully entertaining episodes of dark humor and horror...if you're into the genre this collection and any of the other HBO seasonal Tales From the Crypt releases are for you. Alas...by the sixth season the directorial effort and actor ambition had waned, and The Tales From The Crypt series was startin' to look a bit long in the fang.

Airing first in 1989 and finishing out in 1996, season six of the seven-season series follows season 5...where the producers should have initially considered bringing in some adaptations of modern short stories from the likes of Stephen King and Dean R. Koontz, because the best EC Comic stories were done in seasons one through four. But I guess the producers felt it was taboo to stray from the EC Comics classics. (In my review of Tales 5 {that mirrors this review almost exactly, with the exception of the individual episode puns} a commenter said that, ""part of the TV deal with William Gaines was that all of the Tales From The Crypt episodes had to be based on EC Comics stories.""

That's too bad, because the following episodes were good...but just good. Not great...like seasons 1 - 4.

Season 6 gives you:

""Let the Punishment Fit the Crime"" -- Hey, I'm a lawyer...trust me.

""Only Skin Deep"" -- Double bagger...c'mon...we've all had one.

""Whirlpool"" -- Deja vu.

""Operation Friendship"" -- Imaginary friends don't like brown nosers.

""Revenge Is the Nuts"" -- Do you see what I see?

""The Bribe"" -- You're playing with fire when you shut down lap dancing.

""The Pit"" --  Danke Schoen, oh, Danke Schoen.

The Assassin -- I'm a Demon Knight, not an assasian!

Staired in Horror -- Baby I need your lovin'.

In the Groove -- ...This is Howard Stern on drugs.

Surprise Party -- History has a nasty way of repeating itself.

Doctor of Horror -- Ya gotta have soul, man.

Comes the Dawn -- Vampires suck.

99 & 44/100% Pure Horror -- I love myself.

You, Murderer -- Doctor, doctor...gimmme the news...

I'm a big Tales fan, but the ""Add to Cart"" button was a bit hard to press for season 6. These'll really kill ya!",1177632000,17,2661,4.653104925053533
2807073,4,B000P0J0E2,"The sixth season of HBO's smashing horror anthology Tales From the Crypt marked a slight decline in terms of both horror and fun for the show, but it's still great regardless. Surprisingly, some of the best episodes of this season feature less horror elements than one would expect, including ""Only Skin Deep"", which features a control freak (Stephen Liska) who gets a big Halloween surprise after a one night stand with a mask wearing stranger (Sherrie Rose), as well as ""The Bribe"", in which a fire marshal (Terry O'Quinn) goes to extreme measures to ensure his daughter (Kimberly Williams) stays out of a sleazy club run by Esai Morales and a pre-Oscar winning Benicio Del Toro. ""Staired in Horror"" features D.B. Sweeney as a con on the run who holds up the house of an elderly woman for the night, and gets a big surprise. ""Doctor of Horror"" is a great episode featuring Hank Azaria and Travis Tritt as two night guards trying to make a quick buck from a doctor (Austin Pendleton) who thinks he can discover and harvest the human soul, while ""Comes the Dawn"" features Michael Ironside and Bruce Payne as two poachers in Alaska who come across demonic vampires (this episode pre-dates Steve Niles' comic book and upcoming film adaptation 30 Days of Night in terms of it's central idea). The standout episode however comes from executive producer and director Robert Zemeckis, hot off the success of Forest Gump. Using the computer imagery technology he used in stock footage in that film, he re-creates the face and voice of legendary actor Humphrey Bogart in the ultra campy, and enjoyable, ""You, Murderer""; which also features John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini. However, this season also has it's share of misses, including ""Let the Punishment Fit the Crime"" with Catherine O'Hara as a big city lawyer in some small town, big time trouble, ""The Pit"" which is lacking in terms of everything except for Wayne Newton screen time, and ""The Assassin"", which has an outcome you'll see coming a mile away. All in all, while the sixth season of Tales From the Crypt may not be as excellent as any of the previous seasons before it, it's great regardless, and definitely worth picking up.",1177459200,22,2187,4.834666666666666

2807096,3,B000P0J0E2,"Tales from the Crypt was a highly enjoyable, tongue-in-cheek, horror anthology series on HBO, based on various 50s EC Horror Comics, but by this sixth season, the producers had used most of the good material, and the show was definitely on the downside. Each season had some klunkers, but the ratio is about 50/50 here. Still, there's a few good stories, including a nifty one with housewife Shelley Hack fighting off trained hit men, leading to a doozie of a twist ending. Also good is Catherine O'Hara as an ambulance chasing attorney who finds herself the defendant in a town that doesn't take to legal theatrics.

2807104,5,B000P0J0E2,"Look Season 6 is known as one of the weaker seasons. I think in some episodes it lacks but on a whole season 6 is as good as season 4. It has quite a few classics.

Episodes

Let The Punishment Fit The Crime - A terrific way to start out.  Catherine O Hara (The Home Alone mom) stars as a lawyer who while in a small town is charged with the most petty crimes and all of the punishments are severe. It's a weird episode. It makes no sense at all and is not even plausible but it is really great fun and is entertaining. Catherine O Hara is quite cool which helps out. 3.5 out of 4

Only Skin Deep - One of the best episodes of any season.. period. A man coming off a bad relationship (where he was violent) meets a masked woman at a Halloween party. Soon she takes him home. But he has no idea how truly eveil she is. There are no words to describe how good this episode is. It's dark, it's chilling and it's scary. The end is vicious and the whole thing keeps you in suspense. Great mystery here. Love it. 4 out of 4

Whirlpool - What started off as terrific soon turns weak in this tame and confusing tale. A woman has deja vu. Pretty much about it. Tales like this can be scary but this takes the comedy route and pretty much flops in my opinion. It's rather dumb. I was disappointed for sure. Not a boring watch at least. And it does have a Korman's Kalamity vibe. 2.5 out of 4

Operation Friendship - This is just terrible. Honestly this is by far the worst episode of the series. Yes even worse then The Pit (which I will review soon) . This is the most annoying episode by a mile. A man starts to ignore his imaginary friend when he meets a woman. The friend does not like it. It sounds pretty bad the way it plays out is even worse. The lead guy is the worst lead I have ever seen in any anthology series. Awful. Worse then a bad Tales From The Darkside. 1 out of 4

Revenge Is The Nuts - Okay this one is alot better. A evil caretaker abuses his blind inmates. But he may have messed with the wrong group. Good episode. It's not the best of the season or anywhere close but it's fine. I wish the ending would have had a little more of a kick. It seemed like it was going too but it ends on a meh note. Overall solid though. 3 out of 4

The Bribe - One of the best of the season. Terry O Quinn stars as a father who wants to get back at a local strip club. Why? His daughter worked there. I loved this one quite a bit. Great acting, a good ironic twist ending and a great flow. It is not really horror but this could be in season 2 IMO. A great episode. 4 out of 4

The Pit - This episode is known pretty much as the worst of the series. In ways.. it is. It's silly as anything and gets so far off the Crypt trail. It concerns two fighters with wives at each other's throats. The women then plan a death match for the husbands. It's is taken as a light piece of fluff and comes off enjoyable. The twist is laughable and the whole thing reeks ""why did they bother?"" But I was never bored and I get a laugh out of it. Either you will think of it as a guilty pleasure or despise it. 2.5 out of 4

The Assassin - One of the biggest surprises of the season. I expected nothing out of it and ended up loving it. Shelley Hack stars as a sweet housewife whose home is invaded by Assassins who want her husband dead. It's one fun ride I must say. The twist is easy to predict but it's fun. Everyone is enjoying themselves here and it shows. 4 out of 4

Staired In Horror - Awesome episode! We are really picking up. A convict on the run takes refuge at a old lady house. But he needs to beware... the stairs at her place has a curse. ... Okay I know. The plot sounds bad. But there is so much more to this episode. It really works. D.B Sweeney is perfectly casted and Rachel Ticotin is terrific. Plus in my opinion the final twist is one of the most memorable of the season. 4 out of 4

In The Groove - Pretty good. A shock radio host somehow needs a rating boost. He gets a new co partner and soon a murder plot is set in motion. Okay this one is fine. It had way more potential then the end result. The end is the weakest part as you are hoping it leads up to something good. Sadly it does not. But I enjoyed it and Miguel Ferrer was great. 3 out of 4

Surprise Party - Almost a classic but not quite. A man inherits a place after he kills his father. Well the land has a bad past. This is not gonna end well. Okay this episode is actually really stylish. The car scenes are great! But there is something missing. I cannot place it. It feels like a good Creepshow segment. It has a good twst and a solid ironic end. 3.5 out of 4

Doctor Of Horror - Amazing episode. A evil doctor is trying to get the souls of the dead and hires 2 nightmen to hlp him out. This is really off the wal and colorful. It's a blast to watch and the acting is good. It is a little disturbing and weird. Plus the finale is gruesome and memorable. This one just works on every level. 4 out of 4

Comes The Dawn - Great. This concerns poachers who are hunted by vampires in Alaska. Michael Ironside stars and you always get quality from him. This episode feels like a solid pre dater to 30 Days of Night. Imo it is much better. It has a great 2nd half that has a season 3 feeling to it. It's not reall gory but it does come across more gruesome then it is. Solid episode for sure. 3.5 out of 4

99 & 44/100% Pure Horror - The name of this episode 0_0 but incredible from start to finish. Seriously this is fantastic! A woman kills her husband for firing her. He is a soap maker and she wants to use it. She will regret it. I know soap sounds off the wall but it really works and it's quite original to boot. The last scene of this episode will stay with you. An overall minor masterpiece for Crypt. 4 out of 4

You, Murderer - This kinda falls flat sadly. It's by the great Robert Zemeckis but he looses his footing here. A man gets plastic surgery and comes out looking like Humpphrey Bogart.  And his ex wife wants to kill him. Okay I am not sure why this one flops a bit but it does. Now it does have great style, and it is memorable for the digital use of Humpphrey.  But in 2011 it looks quite bad. But for the time it must have been fantastic to see. Totally ahead of it's time. But I just think the story should have been stronger.  One of the best parts is the Crypt keeper open. 3 out of 4

2807109,4,B000P0J0E2,"Here it is, creeps, the Sixth Season of Tales From the Crypt. This is when the series began to decline in quality, unfortunately. Let's take a look at each episode.

*POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS*

1. ""Let The Punishment Fit The Crime"" - Catherine O'Hara plays a big city lawyer who ends up in a backwater courthouse and insanity ensues. A good episode, but a bit surreal for TFTC. Kind of feels like the Twilight Zone, but ok. 3 stars out of 5.

2. ""Only Skin Deep"" - One of the more memorable episodes from this season. A man meets a masked woman at a Halloween party. Suddenly things become Jacob's Ladder. Interestingly, this is the only Halloween themed episode I can remember. 3 and a half stars.

3. ""Whirlpool"" - I remember this episode. Harry Anderson goes crazy and his wife wears a dress that looks like a Wonder Bread package. No wait, this is about a different Tales From the Crypt artist. This time the artist is played by Rita Rudner. She goes a little crazy as well, but Richard Lewis is there to comfort her. 3 stars.

4. ""Operation: Friendship"" - Another Twilight Zone episode. This is when this season started to look low-buck. Nothing against Tales From the Darkside because I love that show, but this looks like TFTD, not TFTC. You are not going to be straining your brain looking for the twist in this one. It's alright... it's just not the level of quality we expect. 2 and a half stars.

5. ""Revenge Is The Nuts"" - This is the one where Isaac Hayes lives in a home for the blind and the headmaster is a psycho. The entire episode takes place in the dark as well. I felt blind watching it. 2 and a half stars.

6. ""The Bribe"" - This is, in my opinion, the worst episode in the series' run. Benicio Del Toro and Esai Morales play strip club owners. A Fire Inspector is upset because his daughter is working for them, blah blah blah, obvious twist ending. What was the point of this? They couldn't come up with a monster, a killer, a haunted house story that would have been better? Since when was Tales From the Crypt a family drama? I despise this episode. HALF A STAR! (For The Cryptkeeper intro and outro, of corpse!)

7. ""The Pit"" - A UFC-inspired mess starring Wayne Newton. Again, this isn't Tales From the Crypt. I mean, I know The Cryptkeeper introed the thing, but this isn't TFTC. All of the actors in this one seem like they're goofing off. Why are they goofing around when we are looking for scares? I'm reminded of the very worst martial arts b-movies. Oh and the twist to this one! Not intense at all, prepare to yawn. 1 star.

8. ""The Assassin"" - Hey, Corey Feldman's back. Also, the aptly named Shelly Hack and that guy from all the 80s films that always played a cop that looked like he was stoned out of his mind. This at least feels like TFTC. 2 and a half stars.

9. ""Staired In Horror"" - Personally I can't stand this episode but at least it's in the horror genre. D.B. Sweeney plays an escaped con on the run from, who else, R. Lee Ermey. He decides to hang out at Rachel Ticotin's place since she seems to have sorted all that stuff out on Mars with Quaid and Cohaagen. It's not a great episode. In fact, something about it is disturbing to look at, like an old Basket Case film. 2 stars.

10. ""In The Groove"" - TFTC mainstay Miguel Ferrer is back again to play another weasel. This time he's a really bad shock jock. But not bad-good like Robert Patrick in the classic episode, ""The New Arrival"". No, in this one Ferrer plays a sex-obsessed late-night host that does phoney radio where he has his hot producer talking dirty to the audience. Not scary, just another mediocre Season Six offering. 3 stars.

11. ""Surprise Party"" - Another episode that feels low-budget. This one is about an inherited house that appears to be haunted. Well, at least it's about a haunted house and not cage fighters or neglected fathers, right? Nothing memorable here. 2 and a half stars.

12. ""Doctor of Horror"" - What's this? An actual Tales From the Crypt episode? Finally, something that looks like it could have been on season 5. This is the classic Tales formula: mad scientists, zombies, immoral cretins. Not the greatest thing ever but one of the best episodes of this season. This one has a mad scientist looking for the human soul within dead bodies. It's a lot of fun. Starring Hank Azaria and Ben Stein. 4 stars.

13. ""Comes The Dawn"" - Vampires in Alaska, this is a premise that came up recently in 30 Days of Night. You have a similar situation here in an episode about poachers in Alaska that stumple upon vampires. It stars the great Michael Ironside and I think it's another one of the best episodes of the season. 4 stars.

14. ""99 & 44/100% Pure Horror"" - First of all, I dispute that percentage, there is no way this episode contains that much horror. Some hot chick makes soap. Unfortunately for her, she lives in the Tales From the Crypt universe, so her soap will only cause everyone a lot of grief. They could have made another episode with a monster, or a killer, or something. But they chose soap. Ok, whatever, 2 stars.

15. ""You, Murderer"" - An experimental piece starring John Lithgow and ""Humphrey Bogart"", among others. Kind of a film-noir, suspense thriller installment. Not gonna scare anyone but it's entertaining. 3 and a half stars.

This is my all-time favorite live-action series and I still love watching these discs, despite how poor it can get. Even the bad episodes have intros and outros from The Cryptkeeper, and sometimes, if you look hard enough, you can even get the classic TFTC vibe that existed on the previous five seasons.

Slightly better than Season Seven, nowhere near the quality of the first five... buy this sixth. Then buy Season Seven, then the films, and you have the entire Tales From the Crypt epic to watch over and over and over. And you will. To me, TFTC and The Simpsons are my favorite discs out of my entire DVD collection to watch repeatedly.",1263772800,5,5932,4.481927710843373

2807114,3,B000P0J0E2,"Tales from the Crypt seasons 1-5 were amazing.  As everybody else said, it's starting to go downhill starting with Season 6, which wasn't very good at all.  I'm not sure if I'll even bother buying Season 7, though honestly I probably will just for completeness.

Anyway, just thought I'd post this 3-star review to help offset those 5-star posters who apparently posted before actually watching the episodes!",1191456000,3,408,5.059701492537314

2807117,3,B000P0J0E2,"As a collector of horror films and memorabilia this was a must have however, as most have stated quite clearly here, it's not the best set of TFTC discs to get if you are just getting introduced to the series or simply getting back into it. The writing is definitely not as strong as the first few seasons and the producers delved more directly into EC Comics less horror themed stories as inspiration (not necessarily a bad choice but HBO's TFTC established itself mainly as a straight horror show and I feel it should have stayed the course).

As far as the disc set itself goes it's bare bones: There is one special feature! For about $30 ($10/disc) this set should have much more to it than is offered. This feels as if the producers were just trying to get a fast buck off of early purchases who feel obliged to buy the set even if they don't really think it's worth the cost. What I'd like to see would be some type of collector's cards or some other ""reward"" for early purchasers (especially if no real special features are included).

I'd recommend going for one of the first few seasons and waiting for this set to lower in price (although, like the housing market, this may not happen).",1189296000,3,1196,4.45662100456621
2807118,4,B000P0J0E2,"The DVD quality is as always excellent.

There are some excellent episodes in series 6 but as a whole in this series they seem to have missed the mixture of horror and humour which made tales from the crypt unique (its only real comparison could be with its predecessor - the Addams Family). Maybe this change occured in the original comic version which towards the end was suffering legal battles from people who found this humour/horror mixture offensive - and there by eventually destroyed this wonderful series.",1188691200,2,515,4.919540229885057

2807121,3,B000P0J0E2,"I didn't think Tales From the Crypt had a bad season, but season 6 ""SUCKS"" the stories are silly and have really stupid endings. Almost no blood and gore, I mean it ""they have more gore in two episodes of season 2 than in the whole season of 6.  ""There are no really good stories here.""  I don't know why people give more stars than the season is worth??",1188172800,3,354,4.115942028985507
2807122,3,B000P0J0E2,"After the end of season five, Tales from the Crypt began to go downhill. Not to say that there aren't any good episode to be found on this season, almost all entertaining in their own way, but the stories are nowhere nears as good as in the previous seasons. With that said, there are a few episodes on here that I consider ""Crypt Classics"". Those being; ""Let the Punishment Fit the Crime"", ""Whirlpool"", ""Revenge is the Nuts"", ""The Bribe"", ""Staired in Horror"" ""Doctor of Horror"" and ""99 and 44/100% Pure Horror"". So you see, there is good to be found, but there are also lame episodes to be found as well.

""Surprise Party"" has to be one of the worst episodes out of the entire series. It is about a man killing his dad to get some land property and then discovering that his dad has a dark past so the son pays for it. It may sound interesting, but man is it pulled of horribly. Overall, the season is worth buying, especially for completists like myself-but know that not every episode is gold.",1187049600,3,996,4.413043478260869
2807123,3,B000P0J0E2,"By this sixth season, the series had fallen into a sense of redundancy and suffered from weaker scripts and performances; this penultimate season still manages to offer some choice bits, and for fans of the series, it should be entertaining enough.  In a crypt shell:
LET THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME - Catherine O'Hara stars as an ambulance chasing attorney who finds herself on the other side of the law in a horribly strict small town.  Peter MacNicol costars.  ***
ONLY SKIN DEEP - Peter Onorati plays a sleazy man who picks up a girl at a masquerade party only to find she's not exactly what she seems.  **
WHIRLPOOL - Confusing deja vu piece with weak performances from Rita Rudner and Richard Lewis.  **
OPERATION FRIENDSHIP - Bizarre little tale about a man whose best friend is really an alterego.  Good performances from Tate Donovan and Peter Dobson help.  ***
REVENGE IS THE NUTS - Ludicrously silly tale of a doctor who abuses his mental patients.  Overacting from Anthony Zerbe is a hoot.  **
THE BRIBE - One of the better episodes finds Terry O'Quinn as an honest firechief who takes a bribe to finance his daughter's college tuition, only to have it end in tragedy.  Nice twist.  ****
THE PIT - Tongue in cheek humor and a role reversal elevates this one where two martial artists seek revenge on their possessive spouses. Mark Dacascos stars.  ***
THE ASSASSIN - A predictable twist not withstanding, this wry little tale offers Shelley Hack as the victim of assassins who want to kill her husband.  ***
STAIRED IN HORROR - Predictable gothic tale with DB Sweeney as a convict on the run who seeks shelter from a haggish Rachel Ticotin, who is a little different when she goes upstairs.  ***
IN THE GROOVE - Dull tale of a shock jock whose on the air ratings soar with the help of a lovely new partner.  Miguel Ferrer tries hard but can't save it.  **
SURPRISE PARTY - Been there done this one hundreds of times with a murderous nephew trying to take claim of his inheritance.  Mediocre acting from Adam Storke doesn't help. *
DOCTOR OF HORROR - Tongue in cheek with a message, this one's about a man out to claim souls and using living people to get them.  Hank Azaria is good and Travis Tritt should stick to singing.  **
COMES THE DAWN - Scenery chewing Michael Ironside and Bruce Payne steer this weird little tale of vampirism in Alaska of all places!  **
99&44/100% PURE HORROR - A twist on Ivory soap finds a lovely design artist losing her job and her husband, and takes measures in her own hands, but stay out of the shower, girlie.  ***
YOU MURDERER - Robert Zemeckis pulls another FOREST GUMP by using footage of Humphrey Bogart who plays the victim of his wife and best friend's scheme to murder him.  Witty at times, it features good support from John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini.  ****",1185840000,8,2820,4.573705179282869

A lot of the big name actors no longer turn up in the show at this point. That said, season 6 has one of my fav's in Only Skin Deep.  A solid and complete Crypt story with great makeup FX. A chilling little scare with a gorish ending also. The creepy mask is amazing and I could see this story stretched in a full feature film. Kind of a female Michael Myers.",1476576000,,492,4.125
