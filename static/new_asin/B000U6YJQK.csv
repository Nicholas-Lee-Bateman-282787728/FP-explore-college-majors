8212279,3,B000U6YJQK,"While this workout is not bad, it is not nearly as long is it states on the box.  The intermediate claims to be 45 min...it's 30 to be exact and that includes warmup and cool down.  The advanced claims to be 60 min and it too is only about 30 min.  I don't know where they get their info from but it's wrong.  I have not yet done the core work so I can't say anything about that.  The workout itself is alright, cueing is good but at times Zak is hard to understand. Choreography is easy if you are not new to kickboxing.  I am an advanced exerciser so I found the intermediate to be somewhat easy...I only did it b/c the advanced was so short and I work out for an hour every day.  The advanced was tough at times but would have been much harder had it been longer.  The set is dreary but i guess it's supposed to look like it's being done on the street, hence the name, Street Kickbox.  In all, I would not have purchased this dvd had I known it's true length.",1300147200,,962,4.021052631578947
8212280,5,B000U6YJQK,"Like a few of the other reviewers, I have a large collection of kickboxing videos.  This one is in the top ten.  Good queing, good form.  Both workouts on this DVD generate a ton of sweat without taking it to the extreme.",1289088000,,221,4.214285714285714
8212281,5,B000U6YJQK,"at first i did the intermedate i thought gee not bad, then i did the advances, i never sweat that hard in my life, what a great workout, i have hundreds of kickboxing tapes, but this one your sure to sweat real hard,",1201132800,7,216,4.046511627906977
8212282,5,B000U6YJQK,"I have tried a lot of kick boxing DVDs and by far this one is the best. Zak's instruction is easy to follow while he makes the workout fun. The DVD is separated into two parts: intermediate and advanced, which makes it hard to grow out of.  It's perfect for beginners too. Anyone wanting to lose weight or get in great shape should seriously consider this DVD.",1192838400,9,360,4.373134328358209
