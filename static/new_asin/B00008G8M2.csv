7982878,3,B00008G8M2,"This movie plays a little like a Lifetime channel movie or perhaps a network movie of the week, except with a little nudity thrown in. Other reviewers have relayed the plot nicely, so I won't rehash it all here. I find it somewhat disingenuous in its portrayal of men, especially in one of the first scenes. In a bit of contrivance, a policeman chastises Lisa (Courtney Cox), accusing her of inviting repeated sexual assaults. Beg pardon? I suppose it could happen, though I find it a tad too devious to be believable. No one in her new location appears trustworthy, except Officer Smith (D.B. Sweeney), who frequents Lisa's trailer home to protect her from local psycho Randall (an atypically scruffy Craig Sheffer). Her life becomes so relentlessly miserable that the film becomes almost too dreary to watch. Aside from some decent suspense, there really isn't much reason to see this, unless one happens to be a huge fan of one of the aforementioned individuals. I suppose the other interest here would be the bit of nudity Lisa shows, though most of it is a body double for Cox. However, there does appear to be one brief instance when a body double is not used and we see a bit of Courtney. She looks lovely and does a fine job with her role, as do Sweeney, Sheffer and the rest. Worth one viewing, though don't go out of your way.",1171497600,3,1336,4.594142259414226
7982879,3,B00008G8M2,"I'm a huge fan of CeCe...that's the ""cox"" that is in my name...  Anyways, about Blue Desert, i saw it on tv.  I had pretty high expectations of it and i also already knew who the ""bad"" guy was.  Like the other guy said, it was kinda corny at points and funny too.
Lisa Roberts (Courteney Cox) is kind of a troubled women.  She gets raped on the streets of New York (for the second time) and doesn't get much sympathy from the police department there.  She decides to move to the quieter, more open spaces of Arizona where she meets these two men who are seemingly attracted to her. Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer),is a grungy-low-voice-long-hair sort of guy. He is nice enough though and they go out on a date.  She invites him in, and he makes sexual advances towards her.  Due to her recent rape, she is uncomfortable and askes him to leave.  She eventually knocks him out and that's when we all meet Steve Smith(D.B. Sweeney)the ""nice, good"" policeman.
As he tries to help Lisa, they also become involved.
Things get weird as both the men try to warn her about the other. It's pretty darn suspensful, that is, if you don't know who the ""bad"" guy is.  Still, the acting is top notch and i recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of anyone in the cast or just wanna be entertained by a 27 year-old CeCe.  It's cute...not the movie, her.  Enjoy.",998265600,4,1348,4.373493975903615
