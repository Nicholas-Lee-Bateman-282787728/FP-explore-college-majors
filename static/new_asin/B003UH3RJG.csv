4204334,5,B003UH3RJG,"I think Rob Halford was getting even better with age. His voice is becoming richer and more colourful. The way he sings on this DVD is almost unhuman.
The setlist is perfect- even Never satisfied and White Heat Red Hot... Never heard them live before. The only thing missing is Betrayal- the best song from Crucible and all the bandmates say in the interview section that this is a great song to be performed live. And yet it's not on the setlist. But probably I want too much. The DVD is perfect as it is! I hope that Rob  will be alive and well for many years to come. They are very  few great vocalists  in metal  and we lost  Dio this year.  Unfortunately, there is no replacement in the young generation of bands where the vocals are often reduced  to  background.",1282694400,4,769,4.366197183098592
4204335,5,B003UH3RJG,"All I can say is buy this dvd,if possible crank it through a descent system or headphones,insanely intense,you can't get more metal than this, Rob's voice is dead on,it's an instrument in itself backed up by an extremely tight band that mean business, best dvd I bought in a long time along with the recent 30th anniversary dvd of Judas Priest- British Steel,can't wait to watch it again.",1282694400,2,388,4.720588235294118
4204336,5,B003UH3RJG,"For all you Halford fans out there, this DVD is the one! The sound and song selection are excellent! That rock in Rio DVD sounded like crap compared to this DVD. This is killer stuff! What balls it takes to kick off a concert with 'Pain Killer'. That's how Halford kicked it off when I saw his band at the 'House of Blues' in Chicago 2 months before this concert was recorded. This is as good as any Priest DVD out there, and I really enjoy Live Vengeance '82 and Rising In The East! The guitar solo's in this are incredible! Check out the behind the head solo in 'Never Satisfied'. They did justice to all the Priest songs and Halford, Fight songs, etc. If you are a Priest fan (like I've been for 31 years) or a Halford fan in general, get this DVD, you won't be disappointed! This shreds!!!!!!!!",1281916800,10,798,4.291390728476821

8406001,2,B003UH3RJG,"I'm a diehard Priest and Halford fan and have every cd and dvd ever put out by both bands and let me tell you, the performance on this dvd is one of the best Halford has put out from either band. The band nails every single song, plays tight, and Rob is in top form belting out every tune from the first to the last. His enthusiasm for the material is outstanding and his performance is incredible by any means. He clearly loves performing as much as he did when he first started his career.

That being said, the quality of this dvd leaves a lot to be desired.

I can't believe how many reviewers have said this is a great production. This concert is absolutely horrible!!! Professionally shot? Far from it. The camera work is atrocious!!! My seven year old daughter could have done a better job of filming this concert. The idiots who were hired to film this concert should be dragged out into the street and shot in the head. This is not the work of professional camera operators. There are far too many out of focus, constant zoomed, poorly framed, and sloppy edited shots and the image quality is extremely poor with heavy grain. It's like they shot it with a bunch of home video cameras and edited it together with a couple of old vhs decks. I have no idea what they were thinking but this had to be one of the most distracting and worst filmed concerts I've ever seen.

As for the audio, it certainly fairs much better than the video, but that's not saying much. It's a bit thin overall when compared to the cd version of this concert, which I highly recommend. Nevertheless it is a phenomenal performance of Rob in his prime that I enjoyed.

For my overall rating, I'll have to give this 2 stars and that's strictly for the audio. I can by no means recommend this concert for any but the diehard collector. Save your money and buy the cd version of this concert which has the additional four songs from the short Japan performance also included on the dvd.",1339545600,2,1964,4.402203856749312
8406002,5,B003UH3RJG,"Two years past the release of ""Live at Rock in Rio"" DVD (2008), the metal God Rob Halford releases his second live DVD ""Live in Anaheim"". The release captures the metal God and his solo band in 2003, in support of their second studio album ""Crucible"", mere months before Halford would rejoin ""Judas Priest"".

The line up that performs on stage is quite different to the one that recorded ""Crucible"". Beyond Rob, one finds original guitarist Mike Chlasciak and orignal drummer Bobby Zarzombeck, bassist Mike Davies has replaced Ray Riendeau and Roy Z (""Driver"", ""Rob Rock"") takes over guitar duties from Pat Lachman. (Basically we are looking at the same line up that recorded the latest ""Halford"" album ""Made of metal"" in 2010).

The Programme on this DVD, is divided in two parts: The first part features footage of the recording process of ""Crucible"" along with interviews of all the musicians mentioned above plus four songs recorded during the Japanese leg of the ""Crucible"" tour (professionally shot and recorded). The second part of the DVD is the entire 19-track show ""Halford"" played at Anaheim, also professionally captured at stereo and 5.1. Surround sound. One has to agree that the picture quality could have been clearer, yet as it is, it takes nothing away from the enjoyment of the performance, as the `Halford' band is once again in top form performing material from Rob's two solo albums, ""Fight"" tunes as well as ""Priest"" classics.

Overall, ""Live at Anaheim"" is a complete as it gets music DVD being a great live concert as it is a great band documentary. This DVD really holds a ton of great heavy metal moments.",1301184000,,1632,4.863309352517986
8406003,3,B003UH3RJG,"First, I have been a Judas Pries and Rob Halford fan since 1981. I think he's easily of the best and most distinct vocalists on the planet. I didn't think Rock in Rio was a great dvd, and bought this one mostly based on the reviews here. I can't believe how many people said this had great production! The camera work stinks! It's like they gave cameras to a bunch of drunk teenagers. Too many out of focus shots, choppy zooming, and the video editing is very amateurish. The video itself is poor quality, especially on a big 58"" TV, very grainy and poor lighting doesn't help either. As to the ""great sound"" comments on this dvd, uhh, how many concert dvd's have they seen? I have a kick ass 7.1 system and the 5.1 sounded very thin, ended up watching in stereo as it sounded better, but by no means great. Compare this to the bonus dvd on the 30th anniversary British Steel album and you'll know what I mean. It sounds and looks a WHOLE lot better than this.

All my criticisms aside, Rob and Co. are on fire and sound great, very tight! So my final score is 3 stars. I think it's fine as long as your expectations aren't too high like mine were. Maybe it didn't help that I put this in right after watching the new Heaven and Hell dvd.....now that was first rate!",1292803200,6,1266,4.275
8406004,4,B003UH3RJG,"This is truly a great DVD, great sound, great camera work, great performances by Rob and the band, great setlist (White Heat, Red Hot - YEAH!!!).  One quibble: it appears that MetalMike overdubbed pretty much all his solos as what is heard consistently fails to match what he is seen playing.  It's very distracting, and definitely takes away from the overall experience.  Fortunately, Roy Z's playing seems to be flawless and up to his usual high standard, and there's no evidence of any post-production fixing by him.  The whole band is firing on all cylinders and Rob sounds phenomenal, too.  If I could have changed anything, it would have been to add a few more Resurrection songs, as well as Sun from Crucible - very disappointing that one didn't make it into the setlist.  But all these are minor quibbles - if you love Rob Halford, you simply MUST have this DVD!!",1291248000,,871,4.697368421052632
8406005,5,B003UH3RJG,Long time Rob Halford fan and this DVD did not disappoint.  The band and Rob are in peak form and the audio and video production is first rate (maybe a bit too much video angle switching).  Long live the Metal Godfather.,1290470400,,220,4.341463414634147
