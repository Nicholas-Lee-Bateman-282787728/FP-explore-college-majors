8034975,5,B0002YLDLY,"An excellent and undeservedly overlooked anime.  Basically it's a spoof of anime about a wandering samurai and his adventures and badass sword skills.  Only this time the samurai is a sake addicted woman (woman, not teenaged girl) with badass sword skills and her sidekick is an airheaded Chinese martial artist girl.  There is much humor throughout the entire series.  One of the funniest episodes concerned a Dutch girl.  It not only spoofed Western ideas regarding samurai of pre-opening Japan, it also poked fun at how the Japanese regarded Westerners as big and loud gaijin (the Dutch girl is HUGE).

But humor is not all the series is about.  There is melancholy, sadness and even tragedy in some episodes.  In the final episode you finally get Ran's backstory and it's one of the melancholy episodes and one of the better ones.  I especially liked the opening song.  It's not a typical saccharine J-pop love tune but a wonderful enka ballad that suits Ran to a T.

Really, at this price for the entire collection you owe it to yourself to pick it up.",1421884800,,1057,4.752747252747253
8034976,5,B0002YLDLY,"This anime prooves you don't need blood and fan service to make a good action anime. I was going to wait until I finished the entire anime before making this review, but given that Im on episode 12 and the show is only 13 episodes I decided its safe to review now. This show basically follows a badass female samurai named Ran and her hyperactive but lovable karate master companion Lady Meow on a series of adventures as they travel together. Each episode of the show has its own story. Rather it be one of them getting involved with corrupt politicions or the duo helping someone in need. Im not sure how old the show is, but I take from the way it looks that it was made in late 80's or early 90's. I actually like the old look. The action kicks tons of ass. Theres no blood or anything, but the calm ruthlessness of Ran and agility of Meow expecially in later episodes had me on the edge with excitment and one episode in particular involving a friend of Meow was just intense. Ran reminds me of Mugen from Samurai Champloo if he were female. I would love to see a fight between the two. She sure as heck can drink him under the table. Seriously she is a borderline alchoholic. Sake is her main drink. The show definately hit home with its comic relief too. I can't began to describe how entertained I was by this anime. Im really disappointed it isn't well known. Its way more fun than alot of the newer anime I watched. Check it out its worth it.",1284508800,4,1452,4.283636363636363
8034977,2,B0002YLDLY,"I had never heard of Carried By The Wind: Tsukikage Ran, before I bought the complete collection, and so I didn't quite know what to expect.  I was used to cartoons that, as each episode progressed, got closer to an overall plot.  I was used to watching cartoons with a protagonist who fought throughout the series, up until the final episode, to defeat his/her nemesis.  However, Tsukikage Ran really surprised me.  Carried by the wind indeed.  Each episode in this series is completely independent of previous episodes.  The only constant factor about each episode was the main characters Ran and Meow, and their budding (whether they knew it or not) friendship.  Each episode had a different antagonist, and there was never any mention of events or actions that took place in past episodes.  Carried By The Wind is basically about the life of a sake addicted samurai who wonders around as if she were ""carried by the wind"".  A samurai who, in every town she drifts into finds corruption and with the help of simple minded, yet light hearted Meow triumphs over the corruption.  The friendship between Meow and Ran got off to a bumpy start, but as time progressed (and as Meow constantly helped Ran out when she was low on cash, especially at local inns, or bars)the friendship between Meow and Ran worked itself out.",1105833600,12,1318,4.766519823788546
8034978,5,B0002YLDLY,"When you hear about the great anime series you always hear the staples: Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Escaflowne, etc etc. But I've never heard of ""Tsukikage Ran"", and if it wasn't for seeing the trailer on a DVD I still would be unaware of this clever, hilarious, fun and almost flawless series.

Set in the Edo period, this series follows a mysterious ronin who goes by Ran... who just happens to be a saki loving woman! This is such a great twist in the series that makes it stand out. One of the best parts in many of the episodes is seeing her step in to protect someone in a fight, seeing her enemies laugh and brush her off as a ""weak female"", then see her calmly and quickly take them out with her sword. She's quite happy to wander the countryside alone, but one day she interferes in a fight and a young martial artist Myao (who also happens to be female) is so impressed by Ran's skill that she sort of follows her throughout the rest of the series- much to Ran's displeasure. Unlike Ran, Myao's a typical anime girl sterotype: very hyper, not too bright, and she dresses right out of a Tekken game. This mismatched twosome make a hilarious pair to watch episode after episode, as they balance each other out nicely and play off the others weak points.

The cover makes this look like a typical fighting anime, and while there IS a good amount of great fighting sequences, this is mainly a comedy/parody of those types of anime. You'll be laughing throughout most of the series, though some of the episodes do tackle more serious fare.

The DVD set istelf is nicely done, the discs are held in a Amaray case wide enough to fit 4 discs. It's not the most attractive packaging, but it keeps the discs safe & scrath-free. The tranfers are perfect, and all the episodes have the original Japanese track with well done subtitles and there's an alternate English dubbed track that is also surprisingly well done.

The extras are sparse- previews, gallery- but we do get a cool one called ""liner notes"" that gives historical background information about various events and people mentioned in the series. This is very helpful for those of us not well versed in ancient Japan. All in all, this set is a great deal and a must for every anime fan! The only drawback is this amazing series is only 13 episodes long.",1104624000,27,2311,4.521531100478469
8034979,5,B0002YLDLY,"Hi, I have seen the episodes of Tsukikage Ran when they were sold individually. I assume that this DVD transfer is the same just repackaged into a brick type collection. The transfer I saw were pretty good ones.

What it is about: It is about a female wandering samurai, yeap, female samurai is the first absurdity you find in this series. She links wiht another spunky martial arts expert girl and together they form the odd couple. Sort of Xena and Gabriel on the road adventures, only much less dark.

Our female samurai hero is sometimes serious, except whenever sake is around. Then she cuts loose. She is constantly broke and has to struggle to buy her next drink of sake.

The series is episodic, 13 episodes in all. There is no main arch story, except to spoof every thing about the samurais and or feudal Japan. So every episode is a single adventure that you can say stands on its own. They will face an enemy/ies and defeat him/her/them, after some clowning around, and a few drinks of sake of course.

Funny spoof situations are only one dimension of the series The serious moment will soon come when a samurai sometimes has to pull his, or her, sword out. The sword fights, I felt, are well choreographed, much better than the martial arts fights. Ran is indeed a tough customer, most enemies will misjudge her because she is a woman, till they get owned.

Sword and Martial arts action with buddies on the road humor, that is how I would summarize it. At this price, I recommend you to buy it.",1099872000,14,1507,4.525735294117647
