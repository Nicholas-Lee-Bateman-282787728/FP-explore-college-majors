8306927,2,B001GT9DNE,"There is no reason in the world for a company such as Platinum Disc to omit the film titles for this vol. 2 set which has two silent films from the Hitchcock repertoire, i.e., 'The Ring' (a film having boxing as its core dynamic) and 'Champagne' (a film about a spoiled heiress losing her fortune and having to work for a living).  Not the best of the Hitchcock repertoire but certainly worthy of mention by titles in this 2 set collection.",1377907200,,440,4.432098765432099
