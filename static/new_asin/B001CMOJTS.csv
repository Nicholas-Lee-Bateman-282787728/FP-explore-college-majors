3514265,4,B001CMOJTS,"Very interesting, though I wish the editing could have been less frantic and they would have shown more of the ship's ""innards"".",1363219200,,128,4.863636363636363
3514266,5,B001CMOJTS,"Really enjoy this show. Problem is, its expensive for only two shows on the dvd. You can find more episodes on tv.",1361145600,,114,4.2272727272727275
3514267,3,B001CMOJTS,"Build it Bigger is a great series but this DVD is a disappointment.  There is no menu, no chapters and no features at all.  For $20 I expected more functionality.  The content of the shows is very interesting but the product is overpriced for what it delivers.",1231459200,,260,4.48936170212766
3514268,2,B001CMOJTS,"This series has the potential to be very informative but it is all buried in uninteresting drama.
The problem I have with this is that the presenter is portrayed as an imbecile through out the series. It seems that he knows nothing about what is going on, and it is more about doing things he doesn't want to do while others on the show make fun of him.",1381708800,,353,4.205882352941177
3514269,4,B001CMOJTS,Interesting look at inner workings of large construction projects.  And a lot of jobs that most of us would definitely NOT want to do.,1379548800,,134,4.583333333333333
3514270,1,B001CMOJTS,"I sometimes wonder about the rational behind producing a show like this. Is this program supposed to be about ""big/bigger"" construction projects or is it supposed to be about some guy who has a need to overcome some personal fears. If it is the former, then it fails, because so much time is lost following a bumbling fool around a construction site.  If it is supposed to be the latter, then it fails because the ""bumbling fool"", never overcomes his fears.  Every new program, there he is with the same fears he had before and probably a few new ones thrown in.

I first encountered this program on cable and stopped watching precisely because of the ""bumbling fool"".  I saw it here on Amazon Prime and thought, what the heck, it's free, give ""the fool"" the benefit of the doubt and try again.  Well, I'm sorry, but poor little Danny Boy is just too much of a distraction. I have a great interest in programs related to construction and there are some good ones around but unfortunately, this is not one of them. But to top it off, when I checked on later seasons, thinking there may have been an improvement, I discovered that Amazon wanted to charge for the privilege of watching ""a bumbling fool"".  Sorry guys, but that just aint gonna happen.",1379030400,2,1247,4.544642857142857
3514271,3,B001CMOJTS,"I like the shows content, but the name needs to be changed to ""Girly nerdy engineer boy, girlishly tries to go where real Men Work.""  It gets really annoying how wimpy and scared this guy is.  The guy seems nice, but i would rather watch a real man instead of a girly boy.  The editors really had their work cut out for them to try and find cuts where the men on the jobs were giving him a normal look, instead of dumb founded looks of disbelief, ""is this guy for real or is he just acting like a gay inspector carousso?"" (pink panther) His attempt to climb over the rebarb wall was a classic look at what i am talking about. Can't climb over a 5 foot wall with a safety harness on.  The guy is an engineer. he figures out how to put structures together.  He could't figure out how to put his leg over the rebarb wall without wrapping it in his safety harness. He's just missing his co-host dumb. (dumb and dumberererer)  I'm sure hes book smart but common since is not so common with this guy. Enough said.  Im starting to feel bad for picking on this guy. sorry, nothing personal.",1378771200,,1082,4.223300970873787
3514272,5,B001CMOJTS,"The most Comprehensive show of all.
However, after watching season #1, all others are @ cost !
If it is on prime, it should be free!!!",1378166400,,134,4.1923076923076925
3514273,5,B001CMOJTS,"I am an engineer and I love this show!
This show opens the door to the imagination and it gives you a behind the seens access to many construction sites in the world.
I am glad this show is in the air and I am looking forward for Season 2.
Thanks!",1376611200,,247,3.8627450980392157
3514274,4,B001CMOJTS,Great show overall.  It is amazing what humans can think of and build.  I look forward to each show and new season.,1374710400,,115,4.181818181818182
3514275,5,B001CMOJTS,I LOVED it....period.................What is with the certain amount of words to do a review. Is that not enough already? Yes or no!!!!!!,1368576000,,137,5.2727272727272725
3514276,1,B001CMOJTS,"no, he could not. right from the start were he claims he is better than every architect & engineer in the world because he wanted to get his hands dirty so he did this show (more likely he was too stupid to be able to get a real job). Then he struts around waving his hands all over the place & he says really stupid/obvious things such as ""they need to position the piece before they weld it into place"". Really?",1365984000,,413,4.111111111111111
3514277,5,B001CMOJTS,"Offers a glimpse into some amazing things, which you will most likely never have the chance to witness otherwise. Enjoy!",1363478400,,120,5.05
8288207,5,B001CMOJTS,love this episode because i work at this shipyard and i am able to show my friends and family things that i normally could not.,1519171200,,127,4.12
8288208,5,B001CMOJTS,When is season 2 starting. like the show,1476403200,,40,4.125
8288209,5,B001CMOJTS,This is one of the best shows I have ever seen in my life!  I had never seen Extreme Engineering before.  I happened to see the roller coaster episode on YouTube and I loved it!  Danny Forrester is an awesome and entertaining host and I have learned so much watching Build It Bigger.  I plan on owning all of the seasons of this show.,1473638400,,334,4.171875
8288210,5,B001CMOJTS,"The artificial drama is a bit overdone, but Danny is engaging and informative and I'm very happy to have my kid list an architect as one of his heroes.",1469577600,,151,4.241379310344827
8288211,4,B001CMOJTS,"Even though the host's humor is a little off, he does take the time to explain things to a non-engineer.",1468540800,,104,4.25
8288212,5,B001CMOJTS,a ok,1419379200,,4,1.5
8288213,5,B001CMOJTS,My son and I watch this on our Kindle at dinner time.  It's a great show for us; we learn a lot of great things about some great things that have been built.,1393372800,,157,3.757575757575758
8288214,4,B001CMOJTS,"I used to watch the episodes whenever they came on the Science channel.  Unfortunately, I no longer get the channel, and I missed a few of the episodes due to having a life away from the television.  The host of the show is not a strong, no nonsense host you might find on other similar types of shows, but what he does and explains, is interesting, to me.  This show is definitely not for everyone. Try this season out, it is free, the series does not change very much in later seasons.",1388620800,,487,4.271739130434782
8288215,5,B001CMOJTS,Great show. Good in-depth information on every episode. Down to earth presentation of complicated engineering projects. Would like to see all seasons on Amazon Prime.,1388448000,,166,5.68
8288216,5,B001CMOJTS,"This is one of my favorite documentary construction shows, unlike many other similar shows where stuffy narrator drones on about potential scenarios,what if's and on top of that never gets down to the basic details, this show is just the opposite.

The host has real conversation with the people on the site, he doesn't skip the basic stuff.
He also has a sense of humor and makes the show a little more lively, but (almost) never at the risk of anyone's safety( i remember  him dropping a very, very heavy nut for a bolt many stories,but that is something that happens often on a construction site of the size he was on, and he did not do that on purpose, or if he did do it on purpose i would like to think they made sure no one was below).

there are some bad reviews here about the show, one calls the host (and i quote here) ""gay inspector carousso"", the same reviewer , besides his obvious scorn for gays is also sexist and makes a derogatory comment about women by calling the host a ""Girly nerdy engineer boy, girlishly tries to go where real Men Work.""

I hope amazon deletes that review.

A few more reviewers essentially consider the host to be an idiot, i say ignore those reviews, it is quite obvious that the host
knows exactly what he is talking about many times and as an engineer he actually fully understands the workings of many of these projects/machines.

He will sometimes (many times?) state the obvious, but that is a good thing and one of the things i like about this show as even someone who has never lifted a hammer in their life will understand more about a project by watching this show then a similar show about the same project.
And it never gets annoying or over simplified even for a construction professional ( i work in the construction industry).",1387065600,2,1783,4.470769230769231
