2691190,5,B000KHJGXK,"Great workout!!!! Gunnar is awesome in his instruction on the correct moves.  This workout is over before you know it, and very effective.  I plan to increase my library, by adding more of the Core Secrets collection.",1204848000,3,217,4.837837837837838
2691191,5,B000KHJGXK,"I just did this workout this morning (which I purchased here via Amazon Marketplace) and was again impressed by Gunnar's ability to design and execute great workouts.

I'm an advanced exerciser who has been using fitness VHS/DVD's for many years.

I have also now done several of the Core Secrets workouts and I am definitely a big fan of them, they are a great addition to my workout rotations!

This particular program gets a lot done in a short amount of time. You literally work your whole body in 25 minutes (after the introduction). That includes the warm-up, main workout, and cool-down in that time frame. Some workouts claim to be a certain length but don't factor in the cooldowns in terms of the workout time. Cooldowns are really an essential part of any sound workout.

For folks who are crunched for time it can be helpful to know exactly how long a workout is in order to see if it will fit into your schedule.

For someone who has done Core Secrets ""FUN-damentals"", I think this workout is the perfect follow up program to use as the next step.

It's also a great workout for when you're short on time or lower on energy but still want to get solid full body workout in. I can see this being used as an effective maintainance workout as well when someone is in a lower intensity periodization cycle.

The program utilizes a stability ball and dumbells, and it's a good idea to have a Yoga or Pilates type mat as well. I also recommend wearing athletic shoes for this (rather than doing it barefoot) so that you'll have better traction.

Here is a breakdown of the workout:

WARM-UP

bounce
hip circles
side-to-side rolls
forward rolls
leg lifts
shoulder stretch
triceps stretch
overhead stretch

Main Workout:

bent-over lunges
push-ups
reverse hyperextensions
lying side crunches
-----
bicep curls
leg extensions
tricep kickbacks
weighted angled crunches
-----
forward/side/twisting lunges
lat row/inner thigh squeeze
bridges
lying crunch holding the ball (these are hard!)
-----
one-armed chest press
shoulder press
hamstring press
crunch w/ball squeeze

COOL-DOWN STRETCH
torso stretch
torso stretch w/leg drop
kneeling stretch
kneeling lat stretch
drape stretch
calf stretch
hamstring stretch

Gunnar shows in these workouts why he is a master trainer. He does a great job explaining the movements without overexplaining. The workout maintains a great flow, and it's a lot of fun to do while being challenging enough to be effective.

HIGHLY recommended!",1197763200,11,2474,4.970873786407767
2691192,5,B000KHJGXK,"I just did the 25 minute ""Full Body Workout"" part of this tandem this morning (I reviewed ""Accelerated Core Training"" by itself here on Amazon) and was again impressed by Gunnar's ability to design and execute great workouts.

To get this along w/ ""Accelerated Core Training"" is a great deal because they are both great workouts individually let alone as a pair!

""Accelerated Core Training"" is definitely considerably tougher than the ""25 Minute Full Body Workout"" so you can choose the level of difficulty that you find most appropriate. I'm a big believer in rotating different workouts in order not to fall into a workout rut both physically and mentally.

 I'm an advanced exerciser who has been using fitness VHS/DVD's for many years. I use a variety of disciplines from Strength training, to Yoga and Pilates as well as various types of cardio workouts. Stability ball work is something I'm relatively new to but it's quickly become one of my favorite ways of training!

 Having done several of the Core Secrets workouts now, I can definitely say that I'm thoroughly impressed by them in every way.

This particular program gets a lot done in a short amount of time. You literally work your whole body in 25 minutes (which include the warm-up and cool-down in that time frame). I think this particular workout is the perfect follow up program to do after FUN-damentals.

2691193,4,B000KHJGXK,"This Core Secrets workout on the fitness ball is a powerful one; using light hand weights (I'm using 3 pounds), Gunnar takes you through all the major muscle groups. The best part is, while it's not too difficult, you can feel a difference in your body very quickly. I have only had this video for a week, and I feel stronger already.

The 25-Minute Full Body Workout is just a shortened version of the Accelerated Core Training, which is 45 minutes. They use the same exercises, but the 25-minute version omits some of them. I find the short version a bit too short, since the exercises are fairly slow-paced and it seems like you don't get much done in 25 minutes. The Accelerated workout is a good length for this type of exercise, even for beginners like myself.

I've been doing cardio and very little toning, so this is a first for me, and it is a great fit. You can easily modify the workout to your own level by using lighter or heavier weights. In addition, one of the girls demonstrates easier versions of each exercise, especially those involving a lot of balance. Gunnar is a motivating and friendly instructor. I don't find him annoying; he is very down-to-earth.",1172534400,37,1176,4.595238095238095

2691196,5,B000KHJGXK,"This is a great workout.  I usually walk about an hour a day and due to an injury was unable to walk as I normally did.  I went back to this workout and it really does work those muscles.  You don't think you are getting that much until the next day or so.  It seems too easy but it works.  Sometimes ""More"" isn't always ""Better"".  I do the Accelerated Workout.",1439596800,,361,4.085714285714285

2691201,5,B000KHJGXK,"Just got this and have only done it once, but it feels like a good workout that doesn't tax my old body too much.  I did the 25 minute workout and it was just the right amount of time for me.",1399334400,,191,3.658536585365854

2691203,5,B000KHJGXK,"I've only used the 25 minute Full Body Workout, but have done regularly for the last 4 years, every other day.  It takes about a half hour (with set up and minor furniture shifting) but I can do this in the privacy of my home and I always feel great afterwards.

Having looked at the Accelerated Core Training video, I am a little reluctant to invest the extra time and effort, especially seeing that some of the exercises might be potentially a bit too difficult for me.

The 25 Minute Workout provides just enough all around work and coupled with the fact that I generally double the number of reps in the video and use hand weights for all the required steps, I feel that this is just about the perfect routine to maintain muscle tone and fitness.  On my ""off"" days, I'll generally get in a brisk walk of about 1 hour.  Simple and effective.",1395100800,,844,4.384615384615385

2691206,4,B000KHJGXK,"I originally bought the VHS version years ago. After much wear and tear, in addition to VCR players becoming obsolete, I recently purchased the DVD. I do the 25 minute core program 2-3x a week and I really notice a difference. I don't think this is a good program for hardcore excercise junkies, however, if you're like me, middle-aged and looking to add strengh training to your exercise plan, then this program is perfect. The excercises really work your core muscles, improve your balance and tone your body.",1383955200,,511,4.818181818181818
2691207,5,B000KHJGXK,This is a great video to get exercise without putting stress on your joints. I also ordered the stability ball. Great combination. Highly recommend Gunnar Peterson's workout videos.,1382227200,,181,5.5
2691208,5,B000KHJGXK,I actually look forward to this workout. I will be 65 in November and I am feeling better and stronger each day! The most amazing thing has happened to my knees. They don't hurt anymore due to all the wonderful stretching. I feel like I have really accomplished something when I'm done. He's a great instructor and that cute little smile doesn't hurt either.,1370736000,,358,4.609375
2691209,5,B000KHJGXK,"This is a GREATDVD. I tore the meniscus in my knee and was having a really terrible time finding a workout I could do while recovering.  Everything had squats or lunges or jumping, etc. Then I found this DVD. I feel like I get a pretty decent workout AND there's no pressure on my knees. WHOO HOO.",1368748800,4,297,4.2105263157894735
2691210,5,B000KHJGXK,I love this CD. Actually to my surprise there were 2 CD's in the case. I like the 25 minute workout when I have limited time and then then the CD lasts about 45 minutes. It really works you whole body especially your mid section and buttock and arms.,1365292800,,250,4.122448979591836
2691211,4,B000KHJGXK,If you're looking to not overdo it then this 25 minute workout is for you.  I work out a little harder in the morning and use this at the end  of the day.  Haven't tried the full workout yet.,1360454400,,191,3.8461538461538463

2691217,5,B000KHJGXK,"I started off with the 25 minute Full Body Challenge and after a couple of months started doing the Accelerated Core Training. I was amazed at the results I got! I have lost 42 lbs. and gained muscle all over! I do supplement with 1 to 2 miles of walking every day. But it is amazing what you can do to transform your body if you just commit 1 hour a day consistently (I work out 6 days a week) for 6 months. The reason I was able to ""stick"" with this exercise program, I believe, is because it was NOT HARD. It seemed easy, which of course is why I continue to find more Gunnar Peterson DVD's, to keep challenging myself. Good luck to anyone who begins this. Stick with it and you will be surprised!",1296691200,7,700,4.116788321167883

I just purchased a copy of them for my friend for Christmas that is looking to lose weight.  Gunnar Peterson knows what he is doing and anyone that uses this product WILL see results.  They are fun to do and you will be happy with how you look and feel.  SO HAPPY to have found this when I did.  I would recommend it to EVERYONE. Seriously.
