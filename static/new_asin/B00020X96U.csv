8019792,5,B00020X96U,"An excellent story line and twist. Yes, it's a low budget, independent, sometimes campy film but very creative and filled with tension and drama. I especially enjoyed the scenes featuring an apparently drunken psychic (LAURA TOLAND) counseling the lead actor (STEPHANIE COLET) about her dead husband's terrifying return to the physical world.",1421884800,,342,5.596153846153846

8019794,4,B00020X96U,Wendell Willat (portraying the dead husband...can't remember the character's name) gives a powerful and haunting performance. I loved him in his debut role in 'Following The Bitch' in which he played the naked guy and No Return serves as another gem in the Wendell Willat acting crown.,1292803200,,285,5.085106382978723
8019795,4,B00020X96U,"Once you get past the low budget feel, the story itself is very interesting with some surprising twists. You have to try to look past some of the acting (which is actually kind of comical), although the main characters do a good job. The first 15-20 minutes I spent laughing at some of the acting and the ""soap opera feel,"" but after that really got hooked to the story and had quite a twist of an ending! If you love supernatural movies, you gotta see it!",1154736000,8,456,4.313953488372093
8019796,5,B00020X96U,"Amazing, a must see for fans of suspense and horror. Very Chilling. This one totally gets under your skin. I recommend it highly.",1125273600,8,129,4.6521739130434785
8019797,5,B00020X96U,"Death is the end. Period. Or is it?  In this riveting supernatural thriller, one desperate woman will encounter ties that bind from beyond the grave. ""Ill come back,"" vows terminally  ill Michael Darrow (Tim Palcic) with his last breath. His widow Alice (Stephanie Colet) shrugs this off as the ravings of a sick man, but soon, she begins to suspect that her dead husband is trying to contact her. He swore theyd to be together forever, no matter what.
