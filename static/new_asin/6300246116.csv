This DVD was previously released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/on-VHS-in-1986/dp/6300246116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">on VHS in 1986</a>.

There are two minor portions at the start and end of the program from the original VHS that were edited out of the DVD. (1) Seven seconds of music on a black screen before the first visual. It's the first seven seconds of the song that's already playing as the show on the DVD begins. (2) The INI logo at the very end.

Except for these two minor portions, nothing else was edited out. The F word was used twice and racial slurs were used once (all left intact from the original VHS release).

There are two minor defects that weren't in the VHS: At 21.59 is a slight defect that is not in the original videotape. Also, at 56.16 is a minor edit that is not in the original video tape. During the end credits Tina Ferrari interview, about 21 frames (less than a second) is cut. It sounds like it was done because the audio on the master they used to make the DVD was bad at that spot. Tina's complete line is: ""I like a man... that you can have a little control over."" The ""..."" represents a one second pause in her words.

By the way, all three GLOW DVDs contain the same slideshow and promo bonus features.",1115251200,17,1875,5.357142857142857
7806696,4,6300246116,"I can remember staying up very late on Saturday nights over a friend's house so that at some ungodly hour, on some channel I'm not even sure of today, G.L.O.W. would come on and we would be mesmerized! I don't think most people today would ""get it"" and you either love it or hate it. Watching this disk made me want to call my old grade school friend and invite him over for another round! On a side note the DVD and video are identical so the other review by D. Hoyt is relevant to this DVD release.",1093824000,6,500,4.112244897959184
7806697,5,6300246116,"The Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling is probably forgotten for the most part unfortunately but if you love the 80s, like women's wrestling and enjoy the comedic aspects of the sport of wrestling then you'll probably enjoy this. I don't have the dvd, but I have the video cassette so this review is based on that. This episode is the series premiere of GLOW back in 1985 (or 86) which always took place at the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas. The MATCHES: 1) Americana and California Doll (a different girl, not the points to ponder one) versus Royal Hawaiian and Spanish Red (2) Salt & Pepper versus Sara & Mabel (3) Hollywood (woohoo! my fav!) & Vine versus Tina & Ashley (Tina is now known as Ivory from the WWE by the way) and match 4 is for the GLOW crown (their championship) Matilda the Hun (aka Queen Kong) vs Tammy Jones. If the dvd is the same as the video tape, then this will be WITHOUT the comedy skits and mini rap sessions that the Glow girls were famous for. The first segment on the tape opens with clips from the various matches on the video while Patti Labelle's ""new attitude"" plays. There's also another segment with this song playing and it follows with an introduction to the glow girls. There's also a couple other musical numbers with Tammy Jones and Matilda the Hun accompanied with Hollywood & Vine. IF you followed wrestling in the 80s then you know that the wrestling was...well, not at its best! There were some good matches every now and then, but I just found the show entertaining. The girls always looked like they were having a great time and they were very different than any other wrestling program. For this first show specifically, I think they tried to be more serious and it was targeted to an adult audience. Even their interview sessions had a few ""f"" words thrown in UNCENSORED (unlike the show that aired on tv) so just a warning to you parents out there. This version of the episode is also no the same televised version. There were segments shown on television that aren't shown here for some reason like Americana and Spanish Red fighting all the way to the parking lot. I'm not sure what else isn't shown, but that's just one thing I noticed. There's not much to say about the show. You either liked it or you didn't. After seeing what women can do on WWE nowadays, I suggest getting this just for nostalgic purposes because you're not going to find the ""tough"" action. But you will find alot of colorful characters full and GORGEOUS women!",1073260800,23,2479,4.535714285714286
7806698,5,6300246116,"This video is an absolute classic and a must have for all female wrestling collectors. The program is the start of G.L.O.W. just before it launched into its brief success in the mid 80s. You'll see the current WWF Women's  champion Ivory wrestle in this video as Tina Ferrari (also former GLOW  champion). With her tag team partner Ashley, you'll see the start of one of  the popular grudge wars between them and the street girls Hollywood and  Vine. Americana's (former GLOW champ) war against Royal Hawaiian (former  GLOW Champ) and Spanish Red begins as she teams up with the California Doll  in another tag team match (You'll see a different woman playing the role of  California Doll). The video also doesn't have the skits or rap songs, but  its a great chance to see how the GLOW saga began. Also, for parents this  video seems to be a bit more on the ""PG"" rated side than the  ""G"" rated version you saw on the television. There isn't nudity  but you'll hear a couple uncensored 4 letter words during the interview  segments.",940118400,11,1032,4.6098901098901095
