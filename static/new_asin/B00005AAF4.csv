1412672,5,B00005AAF4,"It is fantastic as pure cinema and entertainment, probably loosely-based on the real dramatic story of his survival, as the ONLY American who survived on that island after the Japanese invasion and their intense, never-ending efforts to find and kill him.  I have also read Tweed's actual book, published after the war, which is highly recommended as a real 'Robinson Crusoe' type survival story, with a lot more details than the movie can show.  Tweed was a highly skilled Navy communications man, which probably saved him, in the end, since he knew -- unlike others -- how to use Morse Code and signal the U.S. ships out at sea.
The actress who plays the young local girl who visits and helps feed Tweed is a kind of subdued love interest for that day's audiences (not really, though always enticing below the surface, in that day) and she does a fantastic job of expression as an actress, for that era and cultural conditions.  I love her facial expression in the 'chicken scene,' where she is hiding a chicken in her clothes and confidently smirking about it.  She is really exceptional and enticing to watch again and again.",1471478400,,1129,4.744897959183674

1412726,4,B00005AAF4,"Navy radioman evades capture on Guam after the Japanese invasion and eventually aids the American counter invasion with intelligence gathering.  Interesting fact based if altered story.

Be aware that Disney somewhat borrowed the book title, ""Robinson Crusoe USN"" and made a comedy ""Lt. Robinson Crusoe, USN""  with a totally different storyline.

AT-6 Texans appear briefly at the beginning standing in for Zeke aircraft, and near the end.  Color footage during WW2 is used to suggest the counter invasion of Guam after Tweed is rescued.

Japanese trucks are American CCKW.

American destroyer at the end is a Fletcher class 500 series, but I can't swear which number as it appears an angle to the viewer.",1429574400,2,705,5.131578947368421

1412730,1,B00005AAF4,"This American-Filipino co-production is a good example of cheap, proto-fascist cinema, with a formula script supposedly inspired by soldier George R. Tweed's ""heroics"" during Japanese invasion in Guam, turned into adventure non-sense, loaded with bad dialogue and ""exotic"" touches by the Filipino actors. Unfortunately, the make-up department had no pancake for them, so while Jeffrey Hunter sports a glorious tan, the others (the dark-skinned locals) are all made-up with obvious powders intended for Caucasians. Add the U.S. Army propaganda, the scratched war footage, the shaky sets, and a score that goes from pompous to soapy, and you have a dreadful product.",1427068800,2,664,5.584158415841584

1412769,3,B00005AAF4,"Great, interesting war story with lots of human drama and important questions. Unfortunately little of this is explored in the film. Jeff Hunter is a great actor, extraordinarily handsome, and poorly utilized and directed. In fact the direction, production, and filming all seem to be at best B-C level television. No real art here being made which is a huge loss of potential given the story. Plus, why not film in Guam? Weird. I'd rather have the film than not, but a lot of opportunity lost and squandered. It helps to actually have a well written script, too, which isn't provided here.
One last issue. Though the DVD says widescreen, on my laptop, which is a widescreen laptop and shows every other DVD that is widescreen, in widescreen, this DVD does not. It is obviously pan and scan, or cut; cuts off a lot of screen material and focuses too close. Really, all around disappointed in the DVD.

When the Japanese military occupied Guam, he had to fight for his survival alone in his sector because all other military personnel were killed or surrendered to Japanese forces.  Although the Japanese military were relentless to hunt him down,he was able to survive because citizens native to the Marianas helped him.

1412797,5,B00005AAF4,"My family spent three years on Guam towards the end of my Navy career of thirty years. So we really enjoyed this film which is based on a true story that happened to a Navy Signalman who hid for a long time from the Japanese who were searching for him. But he would not have survived without the help of the Guamanian people. Good, wholesome flick.",1400457600,2,348,4.287878787878788
1412798,4,B00005AAF4,"I liked this film, even if it has some weaknesses. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Two precisions first:

- to my best knowledge, this film is available only on Region 1 NTSC DVDs; therefore it will NOT PLAY on European (Region 2) equipment
- in the past this film was also known under an alternate title - ""Island Escape""

This film is based on the true story of a US Navy sailor, George Ray Tweed, who avoided capture when Japanese landed on Guam on 10 December 1941 and thanks to the help of local Chamorro population remained in hiding to 10 July 1944, when he was rescued by an American destroyer. He described his adventures in the book ""Robinson Crusoe, USN"" (see my rview of it) published in 1945 and this film is based on this account. The story  was however considerably changed:

- real George Ray Tweed was already 39 and was married with children in 1941 (his family was evacuated from Guam before Japanese invasion); in this film he is 32, which made it possible to Jeffrey Hunter (36 in 1962, but looking younger) to play him; in the film his family status is also never mentioned and we are left to belief that he is single, which allowed for a kind of romance with a Chamorro girl Josephina Cruz (Barbara Perez, a Philippino actress) - in real life no such thing happened)

- a part of the film happens in a leper colony - in reality, to my best knowledge, no such place existed on Guam since XIX century; also, it seems that there is no scorpions on Guam (or at least there wasn't during the WWII - now, with all those invasive species God only knows...)

- the importance and especially circulation of ""Guam's Eagle"", a clandestine information bulletin Tweed produced and distributed when hiding, was somehow upgraded for the needs of the film

- there are also some episodes added to make the story more dramatic and more interesting, one of them including Tweed's ""dog tags"" - but I cannot give away too much of the plot

The one thing that really hurt a lot of Guam's people about this film, that NOT EVEN ONE real Chamorro ever appears in it - this film was shot on Philippines and actors playing Chamorros are in fact Philippino people. For that reason, Chamorro characters never speak chamorro language - they speak tagalog (main native language of Philippines) instead.

Unlike what DVD cover suggests, this film hardly contains any action or fighting scenes - but it doesn't really hurt it, as this is a film about hiding and avoiding capture (followed by torture and certain death), not about fighting.

All this being said, this film remains a good watch, an atypical war movie, in which fighting war is a background noise, but all other wartime hardships are very real.

""No man is an island' shows very well how much good will and heroism from unarmed and vulnerable civilians it takes to save the life of just one hunted man, when this man is on the run from an occupying force serving a totalitarian, merciless militaristic regime. Not only Chamorros but even some of Japanese American people living on Guam helped Tweed, directly or undirectly and in real life at least three of his helpers died a horriblre screaming death in torture dungeons of Japanese military or Kempeitai, a secret special police which was Japanese equivalent of Gestapo...

I liked this film and I will keep my DVD for future viewings. Enjoy!",1396828800,,3370,4.634228187919463

They both knew George Tweed well, played golf with him and socialized with him.  When this movie came out in 1962, it is the first and only time my father ever went to the movies.  He was very anxious to go see it since he knew George and wanted to see how he was portrayed.  I don't think I ever saw my father so upset.  Not only did he say the movie glamorized Tweed but he was not the hero this movie proclaims him to be.  He might have saved some lives but he was the cause of hundreds of natives from Guam to be beheaded.  He cheated and golf and lied.  I read his grandson's review and I apologize but my father would not lie to me and he knew George Tweed.  Watch the movie, it is entertaining but not the truth.",1382572800,,870,4.005813953488372
1412825,4,B00005AAF4,"Jeffrey Hunter was absurdly handsome and really good actor. I don't know why he never became a major, Redford or Newman star. He's very good here as the last American who hasn't been killed or surrendered to the Japanese on Gaum and feels guilty that his refusal to surrender is getting people killed. But the islanders convince him to stick it out and he is eventually rescued. the final battle is kind of absurdly one-sided and apparently the language used by the natives is the wrong on, (they filmed it in the Philippines), but it's still a good movie with a strong performance by Hunter.. .",1379289600,,595,4.622641509433962

1412831,3,B00005AAF4,"This is a great film in spirit, but sadly, the people of Guam historically do not speak Filipino, which is the language that they are portrayed as speaking in the film.  The film credits at the end of the film said it was filmed in the Philipines, so that probably explains the odd combination of language.  Ignoring the language issue, the film itself is great, and I can't help but wonder what sort of career that jeffrey hunter would have had if he had not died so prematurely.",1365206400,7,480,4.443181818181818

1412897,2,B00005AAF4,"The Bottom Line:

A film which takes an interesting premise (the lead character is the only American soldier left on Japanese-occupied Guam) and runs it straight into the ground within 30 minutes, having apparently decided that World War II should be depicted (poorly--the director doesn't know his way around a camera) as a fun game of cowboys and Indians with cute little Guamese girls, strong-chinned American he-men and no sense of verisimilitude at all; No Man is an Island was such a bad movie that it decreased my desire to watch new films for two solid months.

1412899,4,B00005AAF4,"This is a classic case of Hollywood nearly completely changing a story.  The George Tweed and Arturo family saga was interesting enough, wish they'd left it alone.

But ... this movie is still enjoyable (most likely even more so if you don't know the true facts).  Jeffrey Hunter again shows that he can carry a movie on his own, but Marshall Thompson is outstanding as one of the Navy men trying to stay hidden and alive on such a small island.  One good aspect of the movie is that the brutality of the WWII-era Japs is not glossed over, and more importantly, how the Chamaros are truly wonderful and kind people.

There are some tense moments in this film, and it does rate a ranking in the good WWII films.  But it is VERY disappointing the film was shot in the Phillipines, and not Guam.  That simply doesn't make sense.  It should have shown it as it was.",1214524800,8,861,4.405063291139241

The characters who were supposed to be Chamorro were not, but rather they were Filipino. The movie would at times indicate that the natives were speaking Chamorro, when in fact, they were speaking Tagalog. I don't expect most Americans to recognize this fact (nor would they much care, probably), but the Filipinos and Chamorros definitely would. All in all, a good movie, but carelessly done with respect to the portrayal of the native Guamanians.",1178323200,3,594,5.134020618556701

1412927,2,B00005AAF4,"Jeffrey Hunter plays the part of George Tweed, the redoubtable U.S. Navy radioman who survived in hiding on Guam, during the Japanese occupation of that island, with the assistance of many Guamanians who willingly turned their lives upside-down to protect him. Hunter is woefully miscast; devout Antonio Antero, the Chamorro who was Tweed's principal benefactor during his ordeal, was convinced of his Christian duty to assist the American due to the latter's appearance: gaunt and dirty with long hair and sullied clothing, akin to Christ before the crucifixion, but Hunter is obviously well-nourished with his hair style never disturbed, and with barely a nod by his demeanor to his taxing situation. Tweed, as the sole American survivor of the invasion, was a totem to the people native to Guam that the United States was still there, but this fact was overlooked in this production. Although Tweed was hidden within a cave in the island's southeast, a popular tourist attraction today, the scenario places him atop a mountain where he would be in plain view of enemy aircraft, a serious miscue in light of the fact that much of the occupiers' activity was revolving about attempts at his capture. Tweed cleverly repaired a damaged radio and typewriter and through skillful use of both helped to offset Japanese propaganda concerning the true progress of the war; however, this is touched on but briefly and in a distorted fashion, at that. Although obviously designed as packaged Hollywood entertainment, the screen story appears jejune when one recalls that many died to preserve the safety of the real-life Tweed. Filmed in the Philippines with largely local performers, NO MAN IS AN ISLAND flags from consistently poor production characteristics, which tend to jar the viewer's sensibilities. Not surprisingly, the acting is variable, with Marshall Thompson being wasted, and Hunter swallowing many of his lines as well as being uncomfortably saddled with a vapid love interest. Since the script does not delineate a point of view, and there is scant in the way of direction, we are left with one cliche-ridden scene after another. Some potentially engaging sub-plots, in particular one formed from the plight of Japanese-Americans remaining on Guam during the occupation, are only grazed fragments here. Talented Basil Wrangell does his best at editing this affair, but his cachet is finally defeated as the movie flounders forward to its hackneyed conclusion.",1134950400,9,2468,5.234848484848484
1412928,2,B00005AAF4,"A side by side comparison of both the DVD and VHS versions shows the DVD to contain no additional video information at the sides of the frame. That means that the DVD image has been matted to a 1:1:185 ratio that crops important signs, not to mention the breathtaking image of Jeffrey Hunter.

MCA-Universal has insisted on transferring every non-Cinemacope/Panavision movie from the 60s to 1:1:185, including the Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies, which had their precise aspect ratios preserved intact in their laserdisc releases.

Audiences havn't been fooled by MCA-Universal's misguided widescreen transfers on DVD. The out-of-print VHS version of No Man is an Island sells for infinitely more than the low-priced DVD.

MCA-Universal, get your act together. At least try to achieve the conscientious standard set during the laserdisc period.",1094601600,51,843,5.419847328244275

While it doesn't have the large-scale battle scenes of The Longest Day, it nevertheless remains one of my all-time favorite WW2 films. Jeffrey Hunter gives one of his best performances as George Tweed, a U.S. Navy sailor trapped on the island of Guam after the Japanese invade in Dec. 1941. There are four other sailors with him, but they are killed off one by one until only Tweed is left to fend for himself. That is, until he discovers the friendly natives, who continually risk their lives (& in some cases give their lives)to protect him from the Japanese occupation troops. He is continually on the move, however, because the Japanese are always trying to catch him. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that this is one of the best WW2 films you'll ever see!",1082332800,68,832,4.553333333333334
1412931,4,B00005AAF4,"Havent seen it for years, sadly, although 'Hell to Eternity' with Jeffrey Hunter is a fairly-frequent TV re-run, 'No man is an Island' seems forgotten. Seen it at a drive-in as a child, scenes which stick in memory were the early part of the movie the shock of the first Japanese attack on Guam, some of his friends killed in Japanese strafing, his remaining friends being killed off one by one as they flee the victorious Japanese, one shot by a Japanese in a million-to-one shot while hiding in a straw-covered cart, another stung  by a scorpion, till just the main Jeffrey Hunter character(Tweed , I gather from the other reviews) remains, to stay at large and harass the Japanese as well: the printing-press spreading encouraging-news of the US fighting back with the Dooloittle-raid, the Japanese smelling the news-pamphletts and declaring ""ether-Hospital!""(ooops, they are onto them!)
the sword-wielding officer he and the brave Filipinos poison and cover-up, his body dumped on a beach and eaten by crabs,lol,  and the final rescue by the US destroyer he warns and saves from the Japanese gun-emplacement on the island.( and the destroyer's sailors  racial epithets which don't sit well with this man who has lived and fought for 2 or 3 years with these America-loyal people)
Pacific-war fans don't get the run of films that were made about the German war, but this is one Id put in any selection of top-5 faves. Has 'atmosphere' and good moments, is just entertaining yarn. As an Australian, I always was particularly interested in the WW2 Japanese and these Pacific campaigns, to this day. Good story, and Hunter did a few Pacific-war movies.

As Pearl Harbor is attacked, Navy radioman George Tweed (Hunter) finds himself trapped on the island of Guam. All other military personnel have either been killed or have surrendered to the invading Japanese forces. Eluding capture, he alone must now find a way to evade the forces that hunt him down relentlessly in this suspense-packed action thriller. I was very pleased with the respect that was given to the people of Guam who despite the danger to themselves....helped an American Sailor. Due to the help he was given he survived to come back with an armed force to liberate the island and look for his friends. BTW, love the rooster. You'll see.

Even though there is some artistic license taken, the basics of the story are intact. I love films where people have to survive in dire circumstances on tropical islands and this one is suspenseful and just perfect in every way. Hunter is a joy to watch as the resourceful Tweed. It also shows the bravery and loyalty of the Guam natives. I've always wanted to read Tweed's own account of his ordeal in his book, Robinson Crusoe, USN which is available here on Amazon. Maybe one of these days. This is one of my favorite films of all time and along with The Man Who Never Was and Heaven Knows Mr. Allison, is one of my favorite WWII films. There is nothing inappropriate in it either aside from a few beheaded bodies that are shown quickly from further away. Tweed's relationship with Jo is respectful and restrained, not sexy as in so many other films .
