3611054,3,B001GH3CYM,The package was on time. I didn't find the comedians very funny. I thought Sinbad was the funniest on there.,1251763200,,108,4.45
3611055,1,B001GH3CYM,"I agree with all the other reviews which say that this DVD is inappropriate and crude and contains a lot of sexual references.  Shame on you Thor Ramsey for writing a review of your own DVD and defending this TRASH!  The back cover of the DVD says ""get together with your family, friends, and ministry groups...""  There is NO WAY I would share this with my family, friends, and especially ministry groups.  The only thing I would keep from this DVD is the CASE!

I liked Thor Ramsey from Thou Shalt Laugh.  He was very funny without being crude.  But after reading his defense of this DVD, I will NEVER buy another DVD with him on it.  There are plenty of other Christian comedians who can make you laugh without resorting to innuendos and sexual references.  Try Robert G. Lee or Brad Stine, or Apostles of Comedy.",1248998400,6,815,4.489795918367347
3611056,5,B001GH3CYM,"Sinbad is the host, many of the acts are from the earlier Laugh series, but they do new material, so I don't mind. Good family entertainment.",1239148800,2,141,4.461538461538462
3611057,1,B001GH3CYM,"I have an online store and a customer sent this DVD back rightfully complaining that it was inappropriate; sexual comments that were so crude he turned it off because be was embarrassed to show it in the group he had over to watch the DVD. I just watched it and the only good part was Taylor Mason with his puppets. The most STUNNING was Thor Ramsey. A good comic doesn't have to resort to sexual crudeness, but Thor did the most. They all did except Taylor Mason. Thank you Taylor! As a mother of 4 I know there is that important & appropriate time to tell your kids about the birds and the bees. If I was at this concert with my crew...we would have walked out. Don't waste your money.
I want to thank my customer who brought this to my attention. I sell Thou Shalt Laugh 1 & 2 and understand they are good clean comedy. Church, let your voice be heard to store owners. We don't know what's in every DVD we sell.

3611058,2,B001GH3CYM,"My family & I have watched Thou Shalt Laugh 1 & 2 so many times that we nearly have it memorized & they're STILL FUNNY!!! We love them!  I've bought many, many copies as gifts for my friends & family.  They agree these comedians are terrific!  We laughed til we cried - they were so much fun to watch! So, it was with great anticipation that we awaited the arrival of Thou Shalt Laugh 3.  We gathered the whole family together at Christmas to watch it - 4 generations of my family were expecting to enjoy some wholesome laughs together - the same as we had with Thou Shalt Laugh 1 & 2.  What we got instead of wholesome laughs were red faces.  This DVD should have come with a warning that it wasn't appropriate for all ages or mixed company. It definitely is not a G rated program.  Probably not even PG.  It really was embarassing & I'm so glad I didn't buy a bunch of them to give as gifts!  Sorry, guys. As much as I loved the first 2 shows, I cannot recommend the third video. I do hope the producers will try again - we'd certainly like to see more from these very talented performers - I only hope they go back to the types of shows we enjoyed in the beginning - the first 2 successful shows; not the third. (I really only gave them the stars that I did because I loved the first 2 DVD's, the whole concept of a family friendly show & Christian comedy.  These entertainers are wonderfully talented & I'm thankful for them.  The choices in their material was the problem in this show. It is so nice to find something to watch with your whole family. Unfortunately - TSL#3 is not it. I think this Dvd is disappointing to say the least. We only watched it the one time & threw it away.)",1236988800,22,1690,4.185185185185185
3611059,5,B001GH3CYM,"Thou Shalt Laugh 3 is another very funny installment in this series.

Common to all three in the TSL series are the comedians Thor Ramsey and Taylor Mason, both of whom are extremely funny throughout.

The funniest bits are the stories that resonate with us due to their truth, generally because we're familiar with such experiences.  Thor's commentary on modern-day customer service is a perfect example here!  Hilarious stuff!

Taylor brings his trademark humor to TSL3 but really showcases his impressive talent as a ventriloquist with the singing portions.  The audience interaction portion of his show, as with his appearances elsewhere, is the icing on the cake.

Newcomers Horace H.B. Sanders, Lisa Alvarado, and Leanne Morgan all bring their unique comic style to TSL3, and all three are very funny in their own way.  Leanne Morgan, in particular, had us laughing throughout her routine - mostly because we are from the south and we ""get"" what she is talking about.

We were pleasantly surprised by Sinbad, the host of TSL3.  The way in which he handled audience questions - questions which we would expect to elicit deep, profound responses - with deadpan simple answers, was hilarious.

As other reviews point out, Thou Shalt Laugh 3 does contain a heavier dose of sexual humor.  Although most of it should fly over the radar of younger kids, if there is any concern in this regard, perhaps they should just watch Taylor's performance at the end.",1234569600,2,1456,4.946502057613169
3611060,1,B001GH3CYM,"Sorry I didn't find this one any where near as funny as the previous 2 versions
Spend your money else where",1234051200,3,107,4.142857142857143
3611061,5,B001GH3CYM,"Years ago, I had a gentleman complain after a Christian event because I used the word ""buck-naked"" during my show. This offended him, because I guess this is a much more extreme form of nakedness. I mean, being naked is one thing, but we're Christians. We have standards. ""Buck-naked"" is crossing the line, Buddy.
 Welcome to my world.

 One of my favorite examples of humor in the Bible is the prophet Elijah who challenges the prophets of Baal in the book of 1 Kings, chapter 18. The people of Israel aren't following God wholeheartedly, but are ""limping between two different opinions"" like most liberal arts majors. Elijah challenges the 450 prophets of the god Baal to prepare a bull for sacrifice and then place the bull upon an alter without setting fire to it, but instead dousing it with water. He will do the same. Then the prophets of Baal will call upon their god and Elijah will call upon his God and the first deity to ignite the bull is the God. I know. I know. Religions igniting some bull is nothing new. I just wish that somehow I could apply this to Mormon missionaries who knock at our door. First bicycle to burst into flames? Anyway, the prophets of Baal call upon their god from morning until noon when Elijah starts mocking them, saying, ""Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself."" Basically, ""Maybe your god can't answer your prayers because he's sitting upon his porcelain throne."" Traditionally, Christian prayers end with the phrase, ""In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit."" In Baal worship, prayers traditionally end with ""did you wash your hands?""

This from the Book that is our standard for faith and practice. This instance exhibits deliberate sarcasm and mockery and is scatological in nature. From whence does our prudery come? Certainly not the Bible. I have nearly abandoned making this case with many of my fellow Christians, because as one brother put it after our long debate over my use of the word buck-naked, ""Just because the Bible talks about it, doesn't mean we should."" Okay, then. Just because he's an idiot, doesn't mean I should call him one.

Christians are primarily concerned about content, rather than context. We seem to want everything filtered through the eyes of a seven-year old. I understand that we should have the faith of a child, but does this mean all of our jokes have to be knock-knock jokes? There is standup comedy for grownup Christians, just as there are funny vegetables for kids. It is up to each parent to decide when they want their children exposed to various life issues, which in this comedy DVD will be over the heads of most children. Do parents leave scathing reviews of the Bible because it contains the Song of Solomon?",1231891200,11,2746,4.6887966804979255
3611062,1,B001GH3CYM,"My children have the other 2 dvds of ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" and have found them very humorous.  My husband and I had also enjoyed the first 2.  I purchased this third edition for my children for Christmas.  They had not yet opened it, so my husband and I watched it last night.  I cannot express the anguish I felt as not just one but most all of the artists had too many comments to count that were unacceptable.  Most all referred to ""sex"", and some mentioned it outright.  Natural conception and invitro-fertilization were explained.  Had my children been watching this with us, we would have had questions every few minutes about what they were talking about.  My children have been raised very conservative and are naive to many worldly matters.  For this, I am thankful.  If you're looking for comedy consistent with the first 2 ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" dvds, forget this one - it's not worth watching.  My children will only be allowed to watch Taylor Mason from this DVD.",1230940800,32,969,4.641176470588236
3611063,1,B001GH3CYM,"The first two videos were quite funny and with one particular exception, very clean and decent. This video is filled with sexual comments and off-color remarks. One comment made by my family was that ""it wasn't filmed in a church."" That was obvious. I would never recommend it to anyone. Please don't support the producers of this travesty with your Christian dollars.",1230595200,26,368,4.951612903225806

3611065,1,B001GH3CYM,"Part 1 and 2 were good but the last three are ungodly, raunchy, and not funny. Would not purchase in future or let children watch.",1375574400,,130,4.24
3611066,3,B001GH3CYM,I had seen Thou Shalt Laugh 3 before I bought it. I will be honest and say that I only bought it because I love Leanne Morgan. I did not find the other comedians funny but it was worth it to me to buy it to watch Leanne Morgan and to share her act with family and friends.,1363651200,,272,3.706896551724138
3611067,3,B001GH3CYM,"I really like the THOU SHALT LAUGH Series as a whole, but this one was the least entertaining of the ones I have seen. It seems like they are in a steady decline. Hope the 4th one is better.",1313971200,,190,3.8974358974358974
3611068,3,B001GH3CYM,"Sinbad is not my kind of host. I don't understand what he is saying.

Taylor Mason has loads of talent, but not much showed up on this show. This might have seemed better, had I not seen him in the other shows.

The concept for this series is great! Good, clean humor is rare today. It seems that in this show, there is an increased use of ""bathroom"" humor.

I'm thankful that Amazon has made this and many other shows available.",1305331200,,429,4.271604938271605
3611069,5,B001GH3CYM,"""A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.""  This ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" DVD is better than medicine.  I laughed until my sides ached and tears of joy were running down my face...good, clean comedy.  Even though it has a Biblical sounding title, this is not at all ""preachy"" or even pretends to be religious.  It is just great humor that is appropriate for all age groups.  I want all other editions (4) of the series of ""Thou Shalt Laugh""!",1267228800,,436,4.468354430379747

3611071,2,B001GH3CYM,"Sinbad was the funniest comedian on the show ... Thor Ramsey has a nice, professional delivery style.  However, his material was too sexual, considering that small children were in the audience.  His act was fine for Christian adults, or even teens, but not young children.  The other acts were okay, but a little too ""adult"" for their audience.  Taylor Mason was very appropriate and, clearly, a unique talent.

Overall, this DVD is not what I expected.  I thought there would be more biblical humor to relate with.",1264809600,3,516,4.873563218390805
3611072,2,B001GH3CYM,"We stumbled across the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" DVDs last year and were pleasantly surprised at how funny the comedians (for the most part) were in the first two DVDs. While still containing some very funny bits, this third one misses the family friendly mark by a good bit, especially if you have small kids. We try to limit our (and our kids) exposure to the generally crude and profanity laden stand up comedy that is played on radio and TV, but even on ""family friendly"" satellite radio comedy channels some inappropriate content slips through, but we didn't expect that here.

This is the first DVD of four, as of this writing, and sadly there is just too much questionable material on this DVD to recommend it for all audiences.

3611073,3,B001GH3CYM,"I have to say that Sinbad was an excellent host for this event. My problems with this particular video in the ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" series is that there were too many jokes that were off-color and distasteful and would have made me blush if my children were watching it with me. I had extremely high expectations for this video because the first two were so great but the third was a let down and I was disappointed at the sexual jokes. By the world's standards, this is clean. By mine, it was a little too much to have to explain to my children 12 and under...",1254614400,5,558,4.273584905660377
