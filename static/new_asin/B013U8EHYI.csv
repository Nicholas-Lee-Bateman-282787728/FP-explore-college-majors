8728825,2,B013U8EHYI,"Universal Studio silent films have generally not survived in great condition.  This high-end ""Jewel"" production is no exception, but Alpha / Oldies transfer makes it even worse.  This is a heavily-abridged source print, and may be all that survives.  At a running time of 60 minutes in this version, the original release was 6 reels - thus 72 to 84+ minutes.  The transfer is at a natural silent speed, so it would appear that footing is missing.  The plot is difficult to follow and many key scenes explaining the action are absent.  Alpha / Oldies has not included any titles to bridge the lost scenes.  The transfer is soft and the image unsteady.  The authoring of the disc is sub-par with the disc freezing in two places.  As for the generic jazz 78's score, it could not be less appropriate.  This is not a restoration, but merely a poor transfer of a ruin of a silent film of interest.  This release is only for the hardcore devotee - and it's this or nothing.  No alternative source is available.",1458345600,2,1004,4.578651685393258
