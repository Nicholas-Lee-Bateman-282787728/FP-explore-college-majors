8330533,1,B001OCB0P2,"The comments already stated, speak for themselves.

Do you really want to learn sitar? Then I suggest you look up DVD's out of RainCityMusic.

The DVD series by Intrajit Bannerjee will show you how. In my opinion, this is by far the best way to learn, sans a teacher. They may cost a bit more, but you get quality instruction that is longer in time and does not treat you like an idiot, nor will they take up worthless time with ads and promotions about further DVD's. You get more than what you pay for.",1331078400,,504,4.294736842105263
8330534,1,B001OCB0P2,I don't think they understand the concept of instruction.  They only mention the notes of the main strings and completely avoid the tuning of the sympathetic strings.  The video is insufficient for detail and no graphics are provided in identifying which string is being tuned or played.  I feel ripped off.,1327881600,,307,4.980392156862745
8330535,1,B001OCB0P2,"If you want a good laugh, order this DVD.  You'll be rolling on the floor.  It's the worst quality video ever!  Looks like a 12 year old kid edited it.",1327017600,2,151,3.966666666666667
8330536,1,B001OCB0P2,"I found this video very unhelpful. The techniques that were used were not introduced clearly, and some of these were were not introduced or explained at all. The meend technique was one of these. I do not recommend buying this product.",1296432000,2,235,4.7560975609756095
