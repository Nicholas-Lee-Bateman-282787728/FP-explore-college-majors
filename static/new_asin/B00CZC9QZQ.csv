It has many funny moments and I enjoyed the facial expressions on the farmer as he watches the spider consume his nagging, miserable wife.  The spider is realistic with a scary face.  Many scenes stir up memories of drive-ins, diners and street preachers from that time.  Even though old movies are in black & white, it would have been nice to have two versions on the same disc, one colorized for those who prefer their movies in color.",1377820800,,562,4.534653465346534

If you love old drive in B-Movies...you need this. DO NOT DELAY. Mihm knows what we want and delivers in spades! Giant Spider Fun! Grab a bucket of popcorn and a cold drink, hide behind the sofa, and relive your black and white glory days of old!! Mihm once again takes us to Phantom Lake which is this time under attack by a giant radioactive spider menace. And once again a greatly entertaining performance by Shannon McDonough and all of Mihm's usual troupe.

I see a lot of reviews by people who didn't get the charm, but this is a fun film nonetheless. The effects with the tarantula were truly well done, easily as good as the 1955 Tarantula film. I think the cast had a ball making this. As a fan of old horror films, I can assert that the monstrous face of the creature was truly one of the best designs I've seen. It was detailed and angry, but most importantly - horrifying! The visage they created was better than the 1957 film, The Black Scorpion. I especially liked the detailed shadow overtaking the victims as the monster loomed above them ready to feed.",1517011200,,707,4.363636363636363

There's a good chance Clint Eastwood who took out the oversized  South American Bird Spider in 1954's TARANTULA would get a chuckle out of this one too.

If you remember those old drive-in staples like The Giant Gila Monster (which gets a reference) and The Beginning of the End and all the rest then you will chuckle too!

Like the classic 'Lost Skeleton of Cadavra', this total send-up of 1950's atomic monster movies is a total riot. If you're looking for Coppola or Kurasawa, this isn't it. If you want bad dialog spoken with a straight face, the not-very-special effects, stock footage, the goofy acting, plus a catchy theme song - it's all here. And it's funny. Very funny. As funny as the films it pays homage to (I caught the 'Giant Gila Monster' reference). And frankly, this is way better than anything Michael Bay puts out.

5763750,5,B00CZC9QZQ,"Christopher R. Mihm is making low-budget Sci-Fi and Horror movies in the tradition of the 1950s classics.  He's so good at doing this that casual reviewers often mistake his films for _actual_ old-time films.  They don't ""get it,"" but maybe _you_ will.  This is a giant bug movie in the vein of Tarantula, THEM!, or Earth vs.the Spider -- except it was made just a few years ago on a shoestring budget (less than sending a kid to a private school for a year -- far less).  And this film TOTALLY ROCKS, from the rockin' opening song to the rockin' end song and everything between. It's a genuine loving homage to giant bug movies, not a parody (people seem to have trouble distinguishing between the two these days) -- and it's BRILLIANT.  The story is clever and retro in its feel.  The characters seem of the period and are well acted, especially by the two leads Daniel Sjervin and Shannon McDonough -- who play like modern-retro versions of John Agar and Julie Adams. And the special effects are at least as good as most beloved Bert I. Gordon films, probably better, actually.  If you go with it, this film will make you smile.  A lot.  It's a minor modern masterpiece.  Kudos to everyone who worked on it!  And for extra treats, listen to the commentaries and read the subtitles.  Or you could always watch it in Esperanto.

5763752,1,B00CZC9QZQ,"what were you reviewers thinking about???????  Not only was this a virtually unwatchable movie, but, it was actually an insult to the true monster and sci-fi flicks of the 50s, because, they were NOT campy, and instead, took themselves serious and many times were headlined by real actors.....

yes, the special effects were terrible, by today's standards, but at the time, they were new and were experimenting with various techniques. They did what they could do, with what was available.

This horror of a movie shows no effort in any way to make a decent showing:  impossibly bad acting, totally unattractive actors, overly long conversations that go nowhere, and the same silly special effects of back then.

This was a garage movie with inferior direction, cinematography ( if you can call it that ), and a soundtrack from hell.

Annoying and cloying, it was surely a waste of a 1.99 for rental.

I am a huge fan of old Sci - Fi and this was an insult to the genre.",1487548800,3,970,4.670588235294118

5763755,5,B00CZC9QZQ,"I couldn't help but marvel at some of the negative reviews for this film from people who clearly missed the point of it. They said that it was dull and uninspired or silly and stupid. Friends, these people are clearly unaware of the menace posed by giant spiders in the world today.

Did you know that the number one cause of death for transients in the American Southwest is being devoured by tarantulas? Of course not! Big Spider keeps these facts hushed up, along with the reports of 55% of the Australian outback being populated by giant spiders!  Why, it is estimated  that by the time they reach the age of 35, the average Australian sheep-farmer will have died of spider bites at least once!

I commend Christopher Mihm's efforts to educate people as to the dangers posed by giant spiders and their allies among the lizard people from Planet X, who even now threaten our precious bodily fluids and public broadcasting stations.",1485129600,2,934,4.711656441717792

5763758,3,B00CZC9QZQ,"As a screenplay writer for Vimeo/Youtube director Frank Stamm, Im judging this film by the same standards Id grade a low-budget project I was involved in.

A few years ago I saw a low budget film that has been talked about quite a bit -- ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"", directed by Larry Blamire. It was a tongue-in-cheek take on the monster and sci-fi films of the 1950s. It was at times so funny youd back up the DVD to hear a line a second time. Suddenly it seems there are many filmmakers following in the footsteps of Blamire, or working along similar lines independently, including Christopher R. Mihm who directs ""The Giant Spider"". ""The Giant Spider"" has both its good and bad points.

The cons:

The film isn't scripted as well as something by Blamire  Its goofy but never funny, and also doesnt develop dramatic tension its so firmly tongue-in-cheek throughout. The actors often seem on the verge of smiling, without lines or scenes funny enough to warrant that sort of delivery. It seems to me for this film to work, either the humor should have been sharper, or the actors should have delivered their lines as if they meant them and not as if they expected laughs. Comes off real campy.

The pros:

This film is beautifully shot for a low budget production  It may actually look better than ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". The images are crisp, the cinematography is great all around. The editing is quick, and the special effects look good. If you watched this film without sound youd be impressed.

This, in the end, is a frustrating film for having a lot of good elements in place, but needing more bite  either sharp humor or tension.",1484352000,,1650,4.623287671232877

5763760,1,B00CZC9QZQ,"As for my title, read some of these reviews. These people actually thought they were watching a movie from the 50's, despite the pristine quality and better than 50's effects .... as far as integration of the spider into the backgrounds.

Comments like, "" It's okay for the time it was made"". REALLY??? IT was made in 2011 and released on dvd in 2013. You've got to read some of these reviews, they're embarrassing, and they do NOT describe the product properly!

As for the content in the film, the ONLY redeeming thing was the effects. THAT'S IT!

As other reviewers who understood what they were watching, this was a satirical spoof on the genre. The problem is, it was done HORRIBLY!

The flaw, again as those more keen reviewers mentioned, IT WASN'T PLAYED STRAIGHT, which ruined it!
The script was horrible. It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, and it was pretending to be something that never occurred in those old films.

The attempts to be like the 50's were cliche, which would have been fine, but it was just too heavy handed, which ruined the moment of saying, ""Yupp, the woman is put down till the protagonist says how capable she is"".

One can reflect on lines such as in 20 Million Miles To Earth, where William Hopper calls the lead actress ""Almost a doctor"".

That said, I can see a child being interested, but an adult trying to find some nostalgia watching this, FORGET IT!

Just buy Tarantula and Earth vs The Spider. Both much better than this attempt, played straight, and actually entertaining.

Some of the scenes in this are basically GARBAGE FILLER. They include the girl scout scene, the preachers (the worst) the scientist scenes, the hero on the motorcycle scene, all such a waste of time, and again, NOT FUNNY.

I'm guessing like many, this won't be placed back in the dvd player unless you have kids, or you have friends that wish to be equally bored. I found myself falling asleep around the 25 minute mark, and having to watch it the next day. Yeah, it was that worthless.",1483228800,,2003,4.616901408450704

Probably not for everybody- either you get the concept or you don't. But its heart is definitely in the right place, even if it's a bit dry at times. It's a rewarding watch for fans of the genre- there's little nods to older films even in some of the throwaway lines. In one scene, a man mentions a theater owner who is married to a deaf/mute- obviously (I think) a reference to ""The Tingler.""

I am a fan of the spider movies of the 50's (Tarantula, Earth v. The Spider) along with all sci-fi from the 50's. I thought this was incredibly creative. Just about every line of dialogue and every scene of the movie can be traced to other 50's movies. Of course, that is the point. I felt like I was watching a 'new' 50's movie.

5763803,4,B00CZC9QZQ,"This is another of Christopher R. Mihm's tributes to the movies of yesteryear, here taking on the giant bug movies so prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s. The plot here is straight out of that era: atomic weapons testing creates a giant killer spider (with wonderfully comical face) and small town America is doomed if our intrepid heroes (some scientists, an Army officer, and a nosey reporter) can't figure out a way to stop in in its tracks. I won't spoil it for you, though I probably don't have to say a word as everyone knows the basic plot.

I have to be candid here: this is not my favorite Mihm film. (That would be ""Attack of the Moon Zombies"") and there are things I wasn't keen on in this film. First off, this played more as parody than tribute, and while spoofs have a place and I like many of them, they are notoriously difficult to pull off. I noticed this line being crossed mostly in the dialogue, which grew tedious, especially among the scientists. I understand that Mihm was trying to create the atmosphere of one of these 1950s films he so obviously and sincerely loves, but the screenwriting stretched my patience a few times with the obvious forced nature of the exchanges: in the original films this is patterned after the dialogue was terrible quite frequently and the acting was often poor, but the sincerity of the actors was rarely in doubt. The budget here was low, but I was very pleased with the appearance of the film in matching the visual feel of the 1950s originals, and that's the single biggest reason I gave the film four stars. I also appreciate that Mihm packs a lot of extras onto the DVD (commentary, trailer, blooper reel, etc.) and in this case gives the viewer a choice of a bonus Esperanto audio selection, which deserves a star for pure comic genius on its own.

I sincerely appreciate Mihm making these films: like any body of work, some films stand out more than others, and while this wasn't my favorite of his films, it's still an amusing diversion when approached from the correct vantage point. If you are new to the Mihmverse, this isn't the place I'd start, but if you are a fan of the genre odds are you'll like it.",1424476800,9,2169,4.516539440203562

5763826,2,B00CZC9QZQ,"In the fifties and early sixties the teenagers all popped gum and made out at the drive inns watching movies like Tarantula and Black Scorpion. Stock characters included the young couple in love, the heroic scientist, maybe a teacher, a bumbling law man, and the rest of the cast from Gilligan's Island. The effects were special, in that they were outlandish and impossible, like their comic book simple scripts.  But what was most special was the talent that went into making those films.  The directors and technicians, as well as the budding actors were consummate professionals working against all odds to make a good movie. Maybe not Ben Hur. But something good enough to sell so they could earn some more money and do it all again.
  This kind of GREASE Goes To The Monster Movies is a sad cynical slam at these old films, counterfeiting what was good about them and then punishing the audience with bad acting and worse writing done in the name of satire. Mel Brooks did it all with Young Frankenstein already. And everyone involved was a master of their field. The Giant Spider showed use some clever technical effects that looked ""fifties but better"" just the way it was supposed to. Beyond that, it was a shallow debacle with any real talent buried in misguided or incompetent leadership. It is impossible to pawn off bad film making as comedy. Just because a film is cheap, or worse, cheap looking, it will not be funny.  There was nothing funny about the cover art that promised us so little, yet delivered nothing at all. Yet, it is said that ""no one tries to make a bad movie.""  That is not true.
  Troma is a company that has built it's reputation on a history of producing shamelessly tasteless, bad movies. They take pride in making some of the worst movies ever released. The simple fact is there is only one fatal flaw to create bad movies. They must never be boring in any part. To achieve that they must be entertaining. Troma accomplishes this by being crass,insensitive,sexist,crude,offensive,graphic,comically cheap and visually outlandish. But they are never flaccid,or boring. The secret is, they are un-apologetically entertaining. This is very deliberate and expertly done. They are successful because they are very good at being trashy movies. The audiences can always tell when all the ingredients are there, no matter how bad the stew might taste. An amateur can make a treasure look like tinsel, and a master can turn cellophane into gold. We love to see gold as long as it doesn't ""look fake'.
  There really is no difference between today's audience and the audiences of times gone by. It doesn't matter what the marketers say about who is jaded and more educated and how they should be elated in stead of frustrated. In fact the new movies that are being haled as new classics are just like those that have worn the crown for decades. They are called Classics because they are great movies! And they are great, primarily, because they are entertaining. OK, Great is rare. Good shouldn't be that hard to find.  Should it?  The best thing about this film is the cover art on the box. And I sought out this movie.  I looked forward to the time I would finally get to view this inspired retro-gem. By the end I felt robbed.  So, be warned.",1405468800,3,3270,4.7140350877192985

Radiation mutates arachnid into bloodthirsty giant, the scientific community and the military must reluctantly work together, a scrappy newspaper reporter and his dame....well, fill in the blanks. That's not to say that this is boring. Far from it, actually. The Giant Spider promises a good time, and it delivers.

 This is less parody than it is homage to the big bug flicks of the 1950s, and it really is great fun. The silly premise works well with the scene-chewing cast, and the special FX are actually pretty decent compared to some of the bad CGI that crops up in Syfy originals. It's too bad there are so few functional drive-in theaters these days, as Mihm's films seem tailor-made for that type of showing.

In fact, the only thing it gets right is the giant spider, but that's a minor accomplishment compared to the major failures of the rest of the film.

The most memorable of the 1950s sci-fi/horror movies took themselves seriously; and the more seriously they took themselves, the more humorous the audiences found them, then and now.
