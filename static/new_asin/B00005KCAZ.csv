7943115,4,B00005KCAZ,"I've always found these old Vivid vids to be strange productions. They always have great-looking women (isn't Lauren Hayes the most deceptively-hot woman on the planet? Seriously, if you just saw her face you'd think ""soccer mom""), but the production values are embarrassingly bad (did they even know that secondary lighting existed?) and the vignettes are duct-taped together in weird ways, with a lot of non-sensical text on the screen. It's really hard to describe to somebody who hasn't seen one.

However, despite all of that, this one actually is pretty darn good with a LOT of full-frontal nudity (far more than I had been expecting) and some ever-so-near shots of the nether  regions. There also is a lot of content here for the price, considering the extended trailers of a host of other such productions that are included on the flip side.",1304121600,2,849,4.93006993006993
