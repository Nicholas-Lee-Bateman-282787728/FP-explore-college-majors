7906096,5,B00000F00F,How can you not like anything that Tim Conway has done.  Dorf on Golf is by  far the best.  Make sure you go to the bathroom before you watch this or you will wet your pants or panties.,1288483200,,185,3.8157894736842106
7906097,4,B00000F00F,"Robert F. Young appartly missed the joke.
Speaking as a handicapped person myself, the only people who are truely crippled, are those who have lost the ability to laugh!
I first saw'Dorf on Golf', about ten years ago. Then he was in Rome, doing the first olypics, then nothing.
Tim Conway has always been funny, from Carrol Burnett, to 'The Private Eyes', he never disappoints.
If this is half as funny as I remember, it's still going to be a hoot.",1023321600,6,448,4.54320987654321
7906098,5,B00000F00F,"Tim Conway is a comedic genius.  Anyone who has watched his antics on the  Carol Burnett show (in addition to his biography on the A & E channel)  knows that Tim Conway is a good hearted, talented, and most importantly,  funny man.  Simply because Conway portrays a man of short stature does not  mean he is making fun of physically handicapped people.  In fact, Robert F.  Young, I doubt you payed any attention to what you were watching, as  Conway's character is in no way handicapped, he's just short (you fool).",965433600,8,516,4.582417582417582
7906099,5,B00000F00F,"Tim Conway is at his best in the Dorf series of hysterically funny videos.
To the previous viewer: GET a LIFE! To be ""offended"" by  Conway's zany, original slap stick is SAD indeed. Conway is an athletic,  very ""physical"" comedian whose extraordinary body control and  convoluted antics are a commentary on the human condition, NOT a mockery of  the handicapped.
As an individual, Conway is a compassionate and caring  (father of 6) family man, who has donated untold thousands of dollars for  many charitable causes --including support for race horse jockeys who are  wounded and paralyzed from accidental track accidents.
A plus: Conway's  DORF series is suitable for the whole family! In his long career, Conway  never had to stoop to being nasty, vindictive or foul-mouthed to get a  laugh (like many of today's ""comedians."")
Conway is a classic  comedian of rare talent. Anyone with a sense of humor will love these  tapes.",965347200,14,928,4.993464052287582
7906100,1,B00000F00F,I found this Vhs Offensive. It depicted a Physically disabled man in seudo comic situations. I felt it was an insult to physically handicapped persons. I want to return it.,960595200,3,172,4.766666666666667
