Avant spins an unforgettable rubiks-cube-cliffhanger hailed by critics as ""sci-fi cool""; mindbending, exciting, and genuinely intense.

During a late night conspiracy broadcast, a frantic caller claims human beings are living on the moon controlling our every action.  Two young filmmakers chase the clues to an enormous and dark facility hidden in a murky Louisiana swamp.  The two soon find they have ventured deep into the lair of the powerful ""Church of Lunology"", an organization dedicated to hiding their mysterious past while secretly manipulating mankind's future.

Hunted and on the run, the cameras continue rolling as they discover Earth's secret history and a makeshift time machine that could unlock the very gateway to eternal life.  Time is almost up, but this story cannot end until they face head-on the most powerful and dangerous religious cult in the history of the world.",1315872000,6,1566,6.849246231155779
4665288,5,B005EHSH9U,"We love this movie.  You know it is not real, but yet get caught up in the conspiracy.  When you are done, you wonder if somehow the writer and director, Matt Avant, knows something we don't know and just exposed a national secret.

This is one for the ages.... I predict cult classic status in this film's future!
Part documentary, part sci-fi thriller....wholy engrossing and entertaining.
2012!  Aliens!  Time travel!  Lost city of Atlantis! Flying cars!  Secret religions!
Watch this movie for the first time and be blown away.
Then watch it again and again...it gets better each time.",1313452800,4,394,5.306451612903226
4665290,5,B005EHSH9U,"I had to ring in on this movie.
Disclaimer: I'm intrigued by conspiracies.

Science fact, science theory and science fiction are cleverly blended here so bits of truth explored are
somewhat obscured.
I assume because the director wanted it that way.
If you think Oswald did it alone, then you might not get the message in this film.

I had a chance to see this in theaters.

Is it a documentary or shot documentary style?
It seems too gritty and spontaneous to be fiction. Then again, maybe these people are just good, yet unknown actors.

The ""scientists"" interviewed drew me into the story. Einstein's theory of multiple dimensions provides some insight into what is happening or has happened or will happen.

This has an X-Files feel and that JFK conspiracy tone that simply makes something deep inside you think there is a lot we do not know.
Maybe these guys were or are on the way to finding the answers.

Did they find the answers? Or will they in 2012?

My head spun at the double surprise ending which rivals that of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects - but times two.

There aren't lasers or explosions. It's a real thoughtful approach to everything from deja vu to extraterrestrial impact on our culture & history.

I like the movie.
I was exhausted after seeing it.

I felt like there were some answers, but it seemed to open more questions.

One question- is the Internet rumors about what's happened to people interviewed in the film. They pop up and then disappear and pop up again.
The BBC reporter who first reported this story seems to be backing away for some strange reason. What is that about?

Great movie.
You'll see it again after the first time.
Then, you will discuss it for days.",1313452800,7,1710,4.6072607260726075
4665291,4,B005EHSH9U,"Conspiracy driven, ""Lunopolis"" written by Matthew Avant is engrossing to the end. Shot like ""Paranormal Activity,"" but far more complicated and intense. If it was not set in the near future (and instead present day) it could cause a real stir. It starts with a frantic call to a radio station that eventually leads to an investigation (ala Ghost Hunters) in the Louisiana Atchafalaya Basin where an enormous underground facility is discovered and a very bizarre looking machine is found. From there, mysterious men in suits, religious cults and an internet phenomenon spin a wild tale that leads to the end of the Mayan calendar.  Get a group of people over that appreciate good science fiction and sit back and enjoy this tightly woven tale.",1312675200,2,742,4.936

4665295,3,B005EHSH9U,"A couple of conspiracy buff film makers get too close to a weird conspiracy theory that involves a city on the moon. They are followed by a group of a cult church and at 43 minutes into the film they end up at the home of David James as they take the next 20-25 minutes to explain the plot which becomes a complete buzzkill after ten minutes.

The satire of today's cult and conspiracy groups was a work of genius. The characters and actors were dry. Dialogue grew boring especially since so much was done as documentary.  A great idea that missed on execution.

4665297,3,B005EHSH9U,"LUNOPOLIS starts well, with the now-familiar Blair Witch-style footage serving its purpose much better than it has in some other movies. The short scenes do their job creating tension and moving along the plot, such as it is. Unfortunately, the whole thing comes to a screeching halt about halfway through when it's time for the ""interview"" with a new main character and a series of (albeit authentic-looking) History Channel-esque documentary sequences. The story never really recovers. This is a no-budget film, so I won't harp on the acting or fx or ""sets,"" but there is no excuse for the bad writing and terrible pacing that take over at the midway point. The infodump should have been broken up into smaller segments and interspersed throughout the narrative. As it is, we're left with an Ancient Aliens episode inserted into the middle of an action-oriented docudrama. It just feels wrong, and is puzzling since the first part of the movie is done so well. I give the filmmakers four stars for creativity in making the ""moon people"" idea sound somewhat plausible, but only one for execution.",1428192000,,1097,4.967391304347826
4665298,4,B005EHSH9U,"If you like conspiracy theory science fiction, and can tolerate ultra low budget films then you should enjoy this one.
It's got very little in terms of special effects, it's not cinematically beautiful, but it's not ugly, and it doesn't look cheap.
It's well made in the sense that you don't notice, and aren't distracted by quality of the film making. The acting is good enough to deliver the story. A fun watch.

If you liked Banshee chapter, Phase IV, the VHS movies, The conspiracy, then you should give this a shot. It's not specifically like any of those in terms of plot or theme. But to me it fits into the same sort of category of film making.",1422662400,,652,4.4789915966386555
4665299,4,B005EHSH9U,"From what I saw, I would say that Lunopolis was not intended to be any kind of serious film. This is very cleverly written satire of a fairly high degree, disguised in grotty authentic-looking realism, with moments of brilliant sci-fi dropped in here and there. The real-ish scientific commentary on how it's only possible to time travel into the past and impossible to travel into the future was pure gibberish. It sounds great, because it's exactly the opposite of what has been said in some actual science documentaries. The way it and so much else like it throughout the film are played - in a very realistic way even though what's being said is known to be an absurdity - is laugh-out-loud funny when you realize what's going on. This is a skillful send-up of Scientology, Raelianism, UFO conspiracy theories and so much else of what you'll find on the likes of Coast to Coast AM, and it's presented in such a way that you may find yourself getting lost with a big ? hanging over your head for a bit. Great, authentic-seeming sound and video effects when they matter help the production, and generally excellent realistic acting performances make watching this a very weird experience.",1419984000,,1190,4.781553398058253
4665300,4,B005EHSH9U,"fun indie film, only one truly noteworthy acting performance, and the F/X have been better in other movies, but the movie is well written and makes a clever use of almost every conspiracy legend ever made short of lizard people a lot of my friends really liked it.",1383782400,,264,4.520833333333333

4665302,3,B005EHSH9U,"Lunopolis has its moments, though not many. Ambitious but too often amateurish, this had the potential to be a really good film. In fact, I think it deserves to be remade. By that, I'm not suggesting that it needs Hollywood any more than by amateurish I'm suggesting that I don't understand the context of the footage. I get what it's supposed to be, but that doesn't grant it a free pass for its flaws.

The missing ingredients were probably a more senior and critical set of eyes on the script, as well as on the direction in some of the scenes. Right or wrong, too often I had the impression that character choices and reactions hadn't been explored more than superficially. The script needed at least another revision, and some of the plot elements needed to be challenged. Every aspect of this film deserved to be under a microscope, even if (when shooting) the goal was to convey something different--something fast and loose and, within the context of the story, unprofessional.

This clearly wasn't intended to be a mainstream release with broad appeal, but even among the target audience I suspect most would be happier to rent or borrow this one rather than purchase.",1380412800,,1177,4.764705882352941
4665303,4,B005EHSH9U,"Great original scifi high concept material made on a shoestring budget. Basically two guys engineered this film from the producing, music, writing, directing, and VFX.

4665304,4,B005EHSH9U,I rented this for Kindle Fire HD viewing.  Sorry no HD.  This movie has all the trappings of a great B+ movie - Dufus movie makers - conspiracy theories - at least two obligatory special effects - all coupled with a confusing story of sci-fi psycho babble.  Somehow it makes it into the entertaining category.  If the DVD had special features (?) I'd buy it but for now the rental will have to do.  Now about that Amazon prime?,1368403200,,427,4.3544303797468356

4665308,5,B005EHSH9U,"I guess for some people,a great sci-fi film must have big actors and a huge budget with lots of CGI even if the effects are irrelevant and even distracting from the story. I assume these one star reviews come from those people that consider starwars,john carter,e.t.,and tranformers as great sci-fi(i admit that the starwars trilogy was special until they repeatedly changed it while shoving it down my throat for the last 15 years).
this movie is more original than all those movies combined. if you like a good conspiracy/mystery and don't mind low budget filming and medeocre acting,this is a must watch. Give it a chance.",1366761600,4,625,4.90566037735849

4665311,3,B005EHSH9U,"The first 45 minutes were good, with some of the feel of an especially creepy episode of X-Files,  Fringe, or Ghosthunters.  The settings are mostly moody, crumbling, abandoned buildings, and the film does a very good job of creating mystery and suspense.  Occasionally the writing and acting are a little rocky, but over all it worked well in the first half.

But then the format suddenly shifts, from pseudo-documentary footage to a more than 20 minutes of talking heads, laying out an elaborate backstory that combines pretend physics with a satire of Scientology.  There's no more mystery or plot; everything's laid out for us all at once.  The film tries to re-establish the tension for the last half hour, but the storytelling is more confusing than intriguing.",1366156800,2,767,5.0
4665312,1,B005EHSH9U,"Don't bother with it.  The video was very shaky and although the concept was one of a documentary, there was not enough still time to bring the movie into the ""intriguing"" area.",1366156800,,177,4.53125
4665313,4,B005EHSH9U,"Usually I don't like this film 'documentary' genre, but here they did it right.  If you're familiar with Mormonism, you know it's founded on the idea that Jesus Christ and Satan are extra-terrestrial brothers who fought and carried that battle down here on Earth;  those voting for Christ (who also paid for sins, by the way) and loyal enough to the Mormon creed, will get whole planets to rule and procreate forever, populating said planets.

L. Ron Hubbard changes the plotline to different alien races who have engaged in cosmic battle from oh so long ago, folding in the idea that the Jews are 'body thetans' invisibly attaching themselves to your life and health, to stop you from becoming a higher being.  To gain dominance over them, you pay thousands and thousands of dollars (or work practically for free) to get seminars and other tutorials 'teaching' you how to think and act so you can grow past your own humanity.  Because, you aren't really human.

Next, the whole time travel thing with Luciferians mixed in.  You know:  parallel universes and all that Atlantis stuff.  Search in Youtube, if you are unfamiliar with these really kooky groups.

So this film kinda spoofs all three 'religious' groups, but it's not campy.  It skates near the edge of campy, with 'Luna' people dressed just like Mormons, the 'Luna' books mimicking L. Ron Hubbard's book covers, etc.  Yet the plotline is serious enough, and the acting is good enough, to pull off the edgy satire.  After all, these groups are truly scary, in real life.  They've committed crimes of great magnitude during their time: just Google to see the reports in the news, over the past 50 years or so.

It's an enjoyable film, well-shot.  It works.  I'm glad I saw this on Amazon Prime.",1365897600,3,1753,4.770764119601329
4665314,3,B005EHSH9U,"The story line had merit for the hardcore B movie fan.  But it played like warmed over Blair Witch Project with it's jerky camera shots, and shaky pans.  Still, I watched the whole thing.  Not horrible just not all that good.",1365811200,,225,4.439024390243903
4665315,4,B005EHSH9U,"Admittedly the fake documentary / discovered footage format is not my favorite movie style.  That said I can recognize when its done well, as it was here.  The actors and camera work really felt like one of those documentary shows on Discovery or the History channels, right down to the characters reactions, mannerisms, quips, some of the ""extraneous"" footage caught on tape, and even the testimony from experts.  What played out however turned out to be a fancifully fun adventure involving a pretty complex conspiracy theory laid out over millennia, multiple dimensions, time travelers, the moon, Atlantis, secretive religions, and the Bayou.  Because of the style I don't think I'd watch it again, and if you are like me you will have to be in a certain mood to watch these kinds of films, but if you are Lunopolis won't disappoint.  Without ruining the ending I'll just say that I didn't find it predictable and it was pretty unique (at least I've never seen anything close to it) which is refreshing.

4665317,4,B005EHSH9U,"This is a low budget movie.  The cinematography is not the best but is also filmed like a documenty file.  The best part of the movie is about 3/4 of the way through when it discusses multiple time lines, causality loop, and paradox that could/would be caused by the time line being changed.  Of coarse you have to believe that time exists in a purely mechanical universe.  Now is all we have, the past makes us who we are, the future is hope.",1364515200,,443,4.301204819277109
4665318,1,B005EHSH9U,"The best thing about this movie is the end credits.  The music during the credit sequence is OK, and the sequence means that this dreadful movie is finally over.

The film is a bunch of random, nonsensical bits about a secretive cult, time travel, alternate dimensions, alternate realities, moon bases, some sort of green crystal thing, the Mayan calendar, Roswell and government goons . . . all interspersed with shots of jabbering conspiracy kooks and grainy, shaky handheld footage.

If you're interested in any of the above and have (like me) a neverending curiosity and a special interest in the nature of time itself, you will absolutely love this movie.

4665329,4,B005EHSH9U,"In Matthew Avant's Lunopolis, we follow the exploits of an intrepid film crew as they endeavor to connect the dots between various conspiracy theories whilst avoiding the wicked machinations of what appears to be a community theater version of the Men In Black.  If at this point you're thinking Da Vinci Code meets Blair Witch (or Troll Hunter, or Paranormal Activity franchise,) you're not far off track.  It's true that other films have used these same tropes both before and to far better effect.

Does that make this a bad film?  I don't think so. The heart of Lunopolis was the bulk of conspiracy theories it attempted to interweave.  Avant was very eclectic here, endeavoring to connect the dots betwixt Atlantis, aliens, UFO's, the Men in Black, time travel, multiple dimensions, ghosts, cults, and various personalities such as George Washington, Plato, Elvis, John Wilkes Booth and even Adolf Hitler.  These theories were presented by characters in the film, and elaborated upon by various experts in a way that made the film seem more coherent and felt like a natural evolution of the 'lost tapes' trope (though this also has been done before.)  The science, while fringe, was intelligent and, in spots, clever.  The science did appear to contradict itself in spots, but perhaps it was intentional and the 'theories' presented were nothing but speculation.

Lunopolis did have its weaknesses.  Though the protaganists gave a solid performance, it was clear that the bulk of the film's talent were not veteran.  The CEO of the Scientology-stand in seemed to be having a particularly had time choosing a motivation (am I frightened? Smug? Aggressive? Bored?) and the Men in Black were so wooden they were almost comical (particularly the one who rode about on a bicycle.)  I'm not sure if the actor playing the narrator was French (he certainly didn't have a French last name,) but his attempt at an accent was my personal pet peeve and came across as a Texan trying to impersonate Jacques Cousteau.

All in all, Lunopolis was an intelligent, ambitious film that may have bitten off a little more than it could chew.  Definitely worth a watch.",1359936000,,2152,4.958217270194986

Kudos to these filmmakers who, despite having a tiny budget, managed to make a film that was much more fun to watch than many costing ultra-millions more.

Yes, in retrospect, I could mention all sorts of flaws that time and money could correct. But why? The fact is we sat down and thoroughly enjoyed the film from beginning to end. Then we had a great discussion afterward about the possibilities of time and space discussed in the film.

The only thing I really didn't like about it was the guy with the fake French accent. He did a passing job of it, but when he had to speak more than a few sentences at a time, the fakeness of it was like fingernails on a chalkboard to me.

If you compare this to anything remotely professional this film is quite lacking, but it is apparent to me that little to no money was spent on this project.  It is obvious that most of it is fellow film students and friends.  And once you have come to that realization you will notice how good some of the acting, story telling and editing really is.  The interviews with the ""experts"", the music and graphics are exactly like every similarly themed documentary seen on History channel and the like.  Yes, the music is lame, but so is the music in ""real"" documentaries.  Other than the subject matter I couldn't tell the difference between this and ""real"" documentary expert interviews.

The other actors were amateurs, but still did a pretty good job (considering they were free), and the director did a good job with editing to compensate for their lack in skill by pushing the story forward.  There is plenty to criticize, but the story was fun and considering what the director had to work with he did a very good job.  This is definitely A+ material for any film student.

UFOs, Roswell, immortals, moon cities, time travelers, flying cars, time machines, ""haunted"" houses (of a sort), alternate dimensions, space/time distortions, and more.  SPOILER: for example, the story states that a lunar dweller turned himself immortal, then went insane and fled to earth, where he is on a quest to end his immortality (for reasons unstated).  In the story we find out he had access to the power gem, and a time machine, so... why didn't he go back to the moon and use the device to go back in time and inform his previous mortal self to not go through with the immortality process?  See what I'm getting at here?  And later it is shown that the films(and camera!) of the documentary makers somehow survived the dissolution of a time dimension. What?  How does that happen?

Most of the locale's in the movie look like they were filmed in old abandoned places. Everything looks low budget. If you went into this movie expecting to be a multi-million dollar production, you're deluding yourself.

A lot of people compare this movie or others like it to ""The Blair Witch Project"". It's more of a documentary than it is a found footage film. The movie takes in several conspiracy theory and sci-fi elements: time travel, Area 51, moon men, immortality, multiple dimensions, and other things you'd hear on Coast to Coast AM.

I thought the beginning was good, but towards the end the movie fell short of where I thought it was going. The ending seemed rushed in resolution, but things came full circle in the end. All in all, I thought it was a good movie for being put together on a small budget. Some effects looked cheesy, but there were some parts where I felt pretty engaged with what I was watching.

Without divulging any of the story (because, honestly, I watched half the trailer and then shut it off because it was already spoiling the plot), I'll say the interweaving of fact and fiction was done in a manner such that one could easily be led to wonder where the world ends and the creative element begins. The film itself begins with a close parallel to an infamous call to the radio show Coast to Coast AM some years ago (the actual radio show is not mentioned in the film, using different names in place) and then continues to mix documentary-style footage with footage of actual events, alongside mock interviews with authorities on the film's topics. Who knows, some of them might actually be real. I spent close to a half hour on Wikipedia already, trying to figure out what I actually just saw, and I'm pretty sure that's what they wanted.
While it helped to make the film personal and believable, the educational/documentary interview segments did tend to drag on for a bit too long. I'd guess up to ten minutes could have been cut before the viewer was left too far in the dark. Furthermore, the speech of some antagonistic characters seemed unnatural at times, and certain actions by characters on both sides seemed to defy both logic and common sense, such as strapping on an unknown device that was previously thought to be a bomb, then pressing buttons. Listing more examples would be divulging too much information.

If, on the other hand, this is what they do for a living....I'd recommend looking into a new day job.

There are many problems with making a movie like this.  First, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has been copied again, and again, and again.  For instance, video footage found by someone not related to the project and he/she attempts to tell a story about those in the video who have since disappeared.  Next comes the shaky video footage which is often out of focus.  Then we get the tired, predictable dialogue.  And lastly, the ridiculous props and locations.  In this case, we're asked to believe that a jet pack (made from what appears to be old leather, backpack frames, and camping cooking gear), with a mysterious green stone for power is used for time travel.  They might as well have just used a backpack with a flashing red light attached to it. You have to love the character David James, (who spells his name before participating in an interview, as if spelling it would be difficult).  James tells us that Elvis, among others, was from the future.  Oh and yes, James is a moon escapee.  The movie really falls off at this point as we are inundated with numerous interview clips from supposed experts on time travel and all matters of the moon.  It becomes disjointed and directionless for a good 25 minutes.

Science fiction is about suspending imagination, but the trick is to make it plausible based on the picture the writer creates.  In this case, the picture is as porous as a cyclone fence.

This one is excellent. Others have compared it to the ""Blair Witch Project"" -I suppose it is comparable in mockumentary filming style, but it's actually much better as a film. BWP is better known due to their clever viral marketing; this one deserves to be better known, as it is far superior. The story is fairly implausible, even for science fiction, involving time travel, weird physics (that admittedly doesn't make much sense) and people who live on the moon. On the other hand, I found it completely riveting, very spooky and evocative. The acting is generally pitch perfect (there are a few bad performances in a fairly big cast -I'm assuming some or most of the folks weren't professional actors), the characterization is strong, and the dramatic tension is high through the whole film. This guy can really tell a story, and he didn't need an enormous budget, Hollywood cast, fancy sets, lots of extraneous whooshing sounds or wacky CGI special effects to make it work. Mr. Avant seemed to be involved in producing commercials before his film debut: I hope this made him enough money to continue in his film career, as this was really something special.

Viewing this movie will remind you of other entertaining, low-budget SciFi classics such as that '70's shoestring masterpiece ""Dark Star"" or the '60's tour de force ""Night of The Living Dead""; films that had only enough funding to make it to the screen without breaking the bank, yet subsequently provided their creators a springboard to create greater films with higher budgets.  If you are looking for something ""laughably bad"", look elsewhere.  With only the now typical peppering of profanity to raise parental concerns, this movie is viewable by  13+.  Oh, and be certain to snap a Polaroid of this review before ""they"" change it....",1338595200,2,988,5.261146496815287
4665380,2,B005EHSH9U,"It did have a twist ending. No great special effects or anything, strictly low budget.

It is filmed like a documentary, so if you like that style, you will like this one. Kind of like an X-files story. I rented it, and It's worth watching once.",1331856000,2,245,4.326086956521739
4665381,3,B005EHSH9U,"This is a different sort of film that may be of interest to the sci-fi fan but probably not of much interest to those who are not in the fan category. Some men are making an amateur documentary that makes a significant discovery involving a city on the moon and efforts by a secret group to rewrite history using a time machine.

The camera work is deliberately amateurish with shots of ground, feet and other extraneous items that try to lend an air of authenticity to the documentary and make it appear to be done by amateurs who are using the camera to tell their story. The interesting thing to me was it held my attention sufficiently for me to want to watch it to the end. I watched the instant video version and suggest that alternative until you've seen it and can determine if you would like to buy the disc.

The story is complicated enough where one may want to watch it more than once if one has a desire to better understand what is going on. I'll admit it made an impression on me that kept me from simply dismissing it without watching it to the end. You may want to check this one out.",1329523200,39,1101,4.288461538461538
4665382,4,B005EHSH9U,"Watched it just recently and I have to say that the acting and the storyline is pretty good. Almost all the questions that pop into your head is answered at one point or the other. Definitely a good watch, quite interesting and very different to the usual Hollywood Blockbusters. I rate it one less star because it did tend to get lengthy during SOME parts but not by much.",1328313600,,373,4.420289855072464
4665383,5,B005EHSH9U,"This is another of those soon to be indie cult sleeper hits. A pseudo-docudrama made with little funding, and a great idea, with story elements reminiscent of Lost (the TV show), Donnie Darko and Pi. This is classic late 19th-20th century SciFi with almost no (actually pitiful) CGI / special effects: the entire effect (of giving you chills) is done the old fashioned way: with a really good story, good editing and good presentation.

It's only a matter of time before this goes viral (yes, its that good).",1327795200,2,508,4.7727272727272725
4665384,5,B005EHSH9U,"Woah, what a movie. Everything worked in this movie. The director found a way to use the documentary style video shooting, found footage, expert interviews and eye witnesses to weave a spectacular, thought provoking, interconnected masterpiece of science fiction that leaves just a little bit of doubt if this could possibly have some truth to it. Everything was connected. I was amazed at how the writer/director used everything in the story from Atlantis, the moon missions, a Scientology-like religion, Roswell, and time travel to make an engrossing movie experience. I felt compelled to write a review because for a movie where I had zero expectations for, totally surprised me. Well done.",1324944000,5,693,5.252252252252252
4665385,5,B005EHSH9U,"I stumbled upon this gem of a movie when Netflix updated their library, and im glad I did. Its a low budget sci-fi film that doesnt take long at all to become addictive. The acting and directing is fantastic, it feels natural. Shot mostly in the documentary style, much like Cloverfield in that aspect. The story is amazing, definitely the fans of Rod Serling or Jerome Bixby will fall in love immediately, for a more up to date comparison I will say that this movie could rival some of the best Fringe episodes. This is a must see for anyone who loves the sci-fi genre. I bought it off amazon as soon as it was over. A+",1322352000,2,620,4.3076923076923075

It starts with a 'strange, caught on video event' and immediately pulls you into a story filled with twists and turns and conspiracies and secrets and religious cults and underwater warehouses and paranormal activities and of course, a city on the moon.
Shot in faux documentary, found footage style, Lunopolis absolutely hammers you with crazy information and story and when it's all over you sit there and wonder... Could that possibly be true?!
I think it may be!!!",1317340800,4,488,4.963414634146342

It shows through in some places, but overall it feels like a real documentary with real experts chiming in on people who actually live on the moon. This may put Avant up there with directors like Robert Rodriguez and Wes Anderson who had humble beginnings and didn't let the fact that they didn't have a million dollars stop them from saying ""Let's make a movie.""",1316044800,20,455,4.560975609756097
8468254,5,B005EHSH9U,I love this movie.  It is original as far as time travel movies are concerned.  I like the way that is feels like a documentary in some sections and other sections have the feel of several guys filming their explorations with a hand held video camera.  The acting is good.  I found this movie on Hulu when I was looking for something to use as background chatter to keep me company while I sorted through old mail and paperwork.  I got so engrossed in the movie that I had to delay my intended chores until later.  This movie did not disappoint and will definitely attract the attention of  most people who enjoy this genre.,1501027200,,624,4.421052631578948

I even loved the brief sections of the film that broke down into flashbacks told in an almost comic book style way, with illustrations and animated drawings. I also happen to specifically love any movie that involves time travel, and this movie did not disappoint. It had a few theories on time travel that I'd never seen covered in any other time travel themed film before, and it mixes all of that with the new craze of ""found footage"" movie genre very well. The actors were all decent, the film quality good, and the few special effects looked real enough to me. I thought this was a brilliant little, underrated film, and I wish more people could have seen it, and that more people would give it a chance. I rate it a 7/10, at least.
