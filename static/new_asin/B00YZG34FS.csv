8719409,2,B00YZG34FS,"This film is mostly about North Braddock in modern day NOT Braddock. So that is confusing when their going over modern day and a lot of the people speaking in the film. Tony Buba is definatley a highlight as well as the US History and the Mill footage. John Fetterman is not featured once in the whole film except by one resident who makes a notion to ring his neck in a passing mention. They do not talk or feature him at all, so this film is extremely misguiding for all the efforts that were brought into Braddock over the past 10 years and that it only focuses on North Braddock which is very bizarre. I know the filmmakers are french but it is almost like the purposely avoided all the things happening in actual Braddock to help the story. Yes, the story of the Mill is extremely sad and is a sign that the US government does not give a s*** about our industry and many other aspects. Waste of money for the price tag and a lot of filler clips.",1443830400,,950,4.225274725274725
