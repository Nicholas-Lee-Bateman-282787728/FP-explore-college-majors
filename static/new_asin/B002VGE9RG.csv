8382024,4,B002VGE9RG,"Early 80's Ken Wahl...  kinda B-rated... but nonetheless cool.  The basic plot is that the KGB plants a nuclear device in the Saudi Arabian Ghawar oilfield. They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminate 50% of the (then) world oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown... at the time.  The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis.  But all is not lost, enter the CIA's Black Op SPIKE team,  headed up by Ken Wahl, codenamed... ""the Soldier. ""

As for the rest...  watch the movie.",1422662400,,633,4.752293577981652
8382025,5,B002VGE9RG,"Cheesy but good early 80's action movie with LOTS of cool synthesiser music, especialy the love scene. A young Alberta Watson- hot as ever. You may havto watch the entire movie several times to appreciate the plot points. This version at least, has been edited to prevent you from making exploding light-bulbs! Thanks bushwackers!",1268697600,2,330,5.12962962962963
