768110,2,6303987575,"nice looking copy scarred by low quality compression:  Concerning Alpha studios Raiders of Ghost city, the first reviewer has a point about a poor transfer.  The picture quality is composed of small blocks and chapters 1-5 reoccurring picture blocking (the parts of picture block up), which means that Alpha used a low quality compression.  This does not mean that is unwatchable, but that the reoccurring picture blocking in chapters 1-5 may be annoying.  It looks better that some of Alpha's other serials.  It could have been a very nice transfer.  I think Alpha's hillbilly monster did the quality control on this one. Buy Alpha's copy cheap or Contact serial sellers about their copies, perhaps for a few more dollars one can get a better copy with out the defects.

the serial has a balance of action and story.  Each chapter is short so one does not get bored with the story line with much talking.",1330646400,2,905,4.7935483870967746
768111,5,6303987575,"I'm not sure what a previous reviewer was watching, but this ALPHA release is just great; a nice crisp, clear print in sepia tone, which doesn't bother me as long as the image is sharp! Lots of gunfights and chases, great stuff! And Denny Moore gets to star!!! He reminds me alot of Kermit Maynard; straight and narrow guys who had a brief fling at starring roles but always seemed to end up as some third henchman in an outlaw gang with little or no lines, let alone anything to do, other than to get shot and die before 60 minutes are up. However, here Moore holds his own and proves himself to be a capable leading man, easy-going yet tough, delivering his lines well with some sense of wit and charm.
So if you like Universal or just plain Western serials you can't go wrong here. And Lionel Atwill, Regis Toomey, Joe Sawyer, and Jack Ingram are on hand to provide action and thrills...Love it!!!",1268524800,,900,4.427710843373494
768112,3,6303987575,"I ordered Raiders of the Ghost city with the hopes of seeing a classic western with more of adventure feel. In that respect I was not disappointed. Raiders of Ghost City was a fun filled serial with plenty of action and cliffhanger endings. The stunts were well staged and set up nicely. Everything that I look for in a well made serial.

The only problem with the film was the poor transfer. Now I'm not going to say that the DVD is not worth buying because it is a great movie and I don't see any other companies out there releasing this film. So we have what we're stuck with. The picture was entirely in a sepia tone regardless of the fact that I know that is not what the movie was filmed in. Easy fix though as I turned down the color on my TV greatly for a more black and white look. The picture was also out of frame a bit leaving out some of the credits and written intros. There also were some washing out of the picture causing large white spots where nothing could be seen as to what was going on.

However if you like this kind of movie and I know I do then those little imperfections are still worth sitting through. Especially since you can't find this any place else. At least the cost for the DVD is not too much considering the quality.",1197590400,12,1254,4.199170124481328

7860142,1,6303987575,"The Reel Vault version released on 7/9/2015 has no menus at all. You can't even select the chapter. The serial starts as soon as the disc is inserted. The only way to select titles is with the skip function on your remote. You can also use the title button or the number keys, but you cant choose a title via any index on the disc itself. Chapter title names are also a mystery.

This is beyond unacceptable and very amateurish. If a company wants to be in the business of releasing DVDs, they need to do it right. It takes no time or effort to create a menu, so I can't fathom why it wasn't done. Either do it right, or don't do it at all. This behavior is worthy of 1 star.",1523491200,,675,4.075187969924812

The reviewer comparing the VCI and the Alpha Video version, however, is spot on!  Although I don't know as much as this reviewer about the technical side, the Alpha Video version is just harder to watch.  With the big screen TV's we have now, the best possible transfers are really needed.  My 5 stars is for both the Serial and the VCI version - especially for western fans.",1402704000,,487,4.438202247191011

7860151,5,6303987575,"""Raiders of Ghost City"" is a 13 chapter serial from Universal, released in 1944, directed by Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins with screenplay by Luci Ward and Morgan B. Cox.  A fairly unusual Western for Universal, without the overload of stock-footage Indian attacks, until the last two chapters, and good performances from both good and bad guys, this is one of their better serials from the 1940's.

Near the end of the Civil War, Secretary of the Treasury William P. Fessenden (George Irving) sends Secret Service agent Steve Clark (Dennis Moore) to investigate attacks on Union gold shipments near Oro Grande, California by what appears to be a band of renegade Confederate soldiers.  Clark travels under an assumed name, but on the train is recognised by two Prussian agents, Countess Elsa von Merck (Virginia Christine), who claims to be Trina Dessard, a travelling singer (no, she doesn't sing), and Erich von Rugen (Lionel Atwill), alias Alex Morel, proprietor of the Golden Eagle saloon in Oro Grande.  Morel is the real leader of the raiders, and the gold is being stolen so Prussia can expand their empire into North America.

Despite the attempts of the Prussians to stop him, Clark reaches Oro Grande, with help from Wells Fargo detective Idaho Jones (Joe Sawyer).  Jones is investigating the death of their agent in Oro Grande, whose daughter, Cathy Haines (Wanda McKay) is now running the office.  Colonel Sewell (Addison Richards) shows up fairly often to send telegrams, but the wires have been tapped and the messages decoded by Friedrich Lentz (George J. Lewis) in the basement of Morel's saloon.  Morel's henchmen include Edmund Cobb, Jack Ingram, and Jack Rockwell, while in the Wells Fargo office are telegrapher Dan Lane (Joel Friedkin) and Bill Jasper (Ernie Adams).  The good guys get further help from Doc Blair (Eddy Waller).

This appears to be Atwill's only film role in a western, and one of his best in Serial movies.  There's some unintended humor when Virginia Christine, the future ""Mrs. Olson"" of Folger's television ads, goes to San Francisco where a Prussian agent, posing as a coffee importer, uses his warehouse to smuggle gold out of the country.  The r-r-r-richest kind, indeed.  And while the sudden involvement by hostile Indians seems to be due to the writers having run out of ideas in the later chapters, the plot generally holds up well, even if it twists history more than a little to reflect on the then-current war.

VCI's DVD edition, # 8454 is on two discs.  The source print has the titles headed by ""Universal Presents"" and the original copyright is by Universal Pictures Company, Inc.  The image is sharp and well-framed, and cleaned up quite well.  Contrast and gray scale are usually fine, and if in some chapters the opening credits are a little washed out against the sky, they are always readable.  The sound is good if with occasional background hiss and other noise, but without the low level sounds being blanked, and enough high frequency content that the dialogue can be easily understood.  Most chapters have the correct MPPDA certificate numbers, which go from 10141 to 10153; only chapters Four and Eight appear to have been restored by using the titles from chapter Two.

The bonus features on the first disc are ""Bios"" of Dennis Moore, Wanda McKay, Lionel Atwill,  Virginia Christine and the two directors, while the second disc has trailers for Universal serials ""Raiders of Ghost City"" (1944), ""Winners of the West"" (1940), ""Riders of Death Valley"" (1941), ""The Red Rider"" (1934) and ""The Roaring West"" (1935).

Alpha's edition, # ALP 5340D appeared only a year after the 2006 copyright of VCI's restoration.  The image is sharp, the details usually clear, and the framing seems identical to VCI's, as are the MPPDA certificate numbers, including the reused ones on Chapters Four and Eight.  But in addition to their source being suspect, Alpha has video problems.  225 minutes should fit fairly well on a double-layer disc, but something went wrong in the transfer, or in one of the transfers between the original and the one issued by Alpha.  This is most obvious in the earlier chapters, where parts of the picture temporarily stop moving.  The gray scale isn't as good as in the VCI edition, with the highlights badly washed out in Chapter Two.  There is also a roughness to some of the action, like a slow frame-rate is being used, again likely a compression artifact that shouldn't be there.  And there is a pronounced red-orange tone, the dark parts having the spurious color, which is correctable but a nuisance, depending on how the player is connected and the range of the color saturation control.  The sound quality isn't terrible, but also inferior to VCI's, somewhat restricted in both high and low frequencies.

VCI's old edition on VHS, # 1762, is from a print with copyright by Serials Incorporated.  Even chapters Four and Eight have the correct MPPDA numbers.  The image isn't as sharp as on the DVD's, and it is fairly murky, but faces don't wash out, nor do the titles.  The tendency is for it to be a little too dark.  Chapter Eleven shows film deterioration on the left side of the frame.  The sound is a little muffled, lacking high frequency content, but not distorted.  Overall the quality is as good as was expected when the edition was new, but VCI's DVD is significantly better in all respects.

This is a fine serial, and VCI's DVD is clearly preferable to Alpha's cheap edition.  Even without the question of Alpha's sourcing, VCI has better picture and sound, plus a few ""extra"" features.  It costs more, but is a lot easier to watch, though of course that should be done with at least a day between chapters.",1343606400,2,5713,4.867631851085832
