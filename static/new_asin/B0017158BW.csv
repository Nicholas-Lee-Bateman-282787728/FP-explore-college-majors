8264551,5,B0017158BW,"Ken Hensley  -  Blood On The Highway - The Exclusive Release Concert (BluRay)

Recorded live at the Fabrik in Hamburg, Germany in 2007, this special concert featured the complete Blood On The Highway album plus a selection of Uriah Heep and Ken Hensley classics.  Featuring Ken Hensley on Hammond, guitar and vocals and his Live Fire band, plus special guests Jorn Lande, John Lawton, Eve Gallagher and others.",1259971200,,410,4.985294117647059
8264552,4,B0017158BW,"This is a concert in small venue in Germany but very intrersting. First part consist of Ken Hensley's own repertoire and I must say it's very good. If you like Uriah Heep music - his material is not far from it - good old rock with cool ballads. Second part - Uriah classics - July morning,Free me,Circle of hands,Easy livin' etc. - I was raised on it so for me it was my youth all over again. Now musicians: I think Ken himself is in very good shape - his vocals can still go pretty high and clean(very reminiscent of original sound of Heepsters)It was very good idea to include one of Heep frontmans: John Lawton (Innocent Victim era) and mighty Jorn Lande - my personal favorite. They added a lot to the sound of this project - Lande -just great range and tone of his pipes and Lawton - very familiar voice from the past.
My only complaint - Lawton sung sometimes little bit to lazy (or he doesn't have his range anymore) and changed the melodic line of the vocals(for example July Morning - I think it's not a good idea to mess with classics like that).Guitar players are decent and one of them(guy from Norway) also sings and has very good voice too!
If we are talking about production I think video was shot pretty good - the picture on the big(110') screen is very dynamic and detailed. Audio although only dolby5.1
rocks! All in all very good concert not only for guys like me - remembering listening this music on vinyl. I'm giving it four stars though because I have in my library quite a few concerts that are simply amazing and I have to reserve five stars for them. Another reason is (although not their fault) absence of Glenn Hughes -
who supposed to lend his amazing voice to this project(he got stuck in the airport somewhere because of strike).Imagine how it would be with him...Nevertheless deffinitely worth recommending.",1259712000,,1841,4.514970059880239
8264553,4,B0017158BW,I'm also having a problem with this title.  The sound is outstanding.  Too bad there is no video to go along with it.  I have seen others complain about the same problem so I am assuming the disks are faulty.,1239840000,,208,4.15
8264554,1,B0017158BW,"Out of 100+ Bd that I own this is the first one that didn't work properly.
I can't get the video to work. There's no picture at all only audio. My
Panasonic Bd player has the latest firmware installed but still no video.
I was going to return it but I plan on getting the new OPPO BD player this summer and I'm hoping it will work in the new player. Who knows?",1234483200,,360,3.9452054794520546
8264555,5,B0017158BW,"I have been in love with Ken Hensley`s music since the middle of the 70ies, and didn`t like his departure from Uriah Heep in 1980. After all these years he have made some good and some not so good albums and music.
""Blood on the Highway"" is a journey through Ken`s musical life and he has a great skilled army of musicians by his side on this film. Some of the old classic Heep songs is performed better than the current Uriah Heep band (sorry Mick). Jorn Lande (!) is doing a great figure, and the same with former Heep vocalist John Lawton. I do not understand why Eve Gallagher is performing on this Blu-ray Disc...everything else is a nice trip for your ears! Love you Ken! [...]",1225411200,,683,4.34375
8264556,5,B0017158BW,Jorn Lande is amazing on this Live Concert DVD. Worth the price alone just for him being on it but the entire thing is killer!,1220918400,,126,4.08
