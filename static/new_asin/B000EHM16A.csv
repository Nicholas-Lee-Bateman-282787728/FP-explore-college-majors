8109659,4,B000EHM16A,"The cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a good ancient silent film in black and white. Let's imagine what the horror films were at that time.
The first time I watched on TV this movie was two years ago since that time, I see this production as a work of art and maybe as the ""father"" of so many works made later in recent years.
The second film (Dr Blood's coffin) is also good but it was produced in color.",1267488000,,398,4.050632911392405
