8749262,3,B01B43NXPA,"Lady of the Tropics is a 1939 black and white melodrama dealing with mixed race romance (think Madame Butterrfly).

Good looking Robert Taylor (1911-69) is a playboy who falls in love with a half-caste beauty in Vietnam (called French Indochina in those days).  His role here was a continuation of his pretty boy image in films like Magnificent Obsession (1935) and Camille (1936) and it would be a few years before his skills as an actor expanded.

Austrian born Hedy Lemarr (1913-2000) was one of the most beautiful actresses of all time, and her American film debut in Algiers (1938) launched her on a 20 year career that included films like Boom Town (1940), Tortilla Flat (1942), and Samson and Delilah (1949). She often played woman of mixed race (Tortilla Flats, White Cargo). Here in 1939 we see near the start of her career.

Jack Conway (1887-1952) directs.  Conway was a prolific director (over 100 films) who started out as an actor but decided directing was for him when he was asked to wrestle a lion. He directed MGMs first talkie in 1928 (Alias Jimmy Valentine) and worked on Birth of a Nation (1915) as a second director. Conway was particularly good working with long films (e.g., Viva Villa, A Tale of Two Cities, Northwest Passage) and with films featuring women (e.g., But the Flesh is Weak, Libeled Lady).

If you're a fan of Taylor and Lamarr then youll enjoy this film. Otherwise there are better romantic melodramas from this period.",1465516800,2,1458,4.788844621513944
