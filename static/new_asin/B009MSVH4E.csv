8543060,1,B009MSVH4E,"Why Amazon allowed this ""item"" to be listed, I have no idea.
There is apparently no four-pack of blu rays of these movies actually produced, and it's not what the seller sent to me either.

The really confusing thing is that there was more than one seller offering this/these item(s), which made me think that it had to be legitimate... I mean, how could two different sellers both have the same exact collection of vour blu ray movies for sale?

Any way, I only got one blu ray, Sorority Row, and after I didn't hear back from the seller I filed a complaint, and got to keep the item and got a total refund.",1359072000,,608,4.324561403508772
