1825266,4,B000083C82,"Anyone who enjoys relaxing both musically and visually should consider this dvd. Three of the twelve cuts are from Patrick O' Hearns ""So Flows The Current"" cd, the rest are from various other albums. The video footage is beautifully matched to the music, with moments of grandeur and intimacy woven seamlessly with some of Patricks best music. Recommended!",1251763200,,356,5.155172413793103
1825267,5,B000083C82,"This is a dvd i use to sit down and unwind after a hectic day. It reminds me of the places iv'e been to,and the beautiful places i want to go to. I know we all have our likes,and dislikes, but i would recommend this dvd very highly. I will enjoy this for years to come.",1250726400,,269,3.8214285714285716
1825268,5,B000083C82,"One reviewer points out that she wasn't at first aware these were time-lapse photography.  Well, duh!  But you can't watch this beautiful DVD without marveling at the technique and pondering just how on earth these incredible scenes were captured.  Probably the most beautiful DVD I've ever seen.",1216857600,,296,5.25531914893617
1825269,4,B000083C82,"The music on this disc appears to be 'electronic' which isn't my favored type but, with the imaginative cinematography the music somehow just fits. Very enjoyable!",1207353600,,163,5.3076923076923075
1825270,5,B000083C82,"This is a beautifully crafted Video! Sceanes from many of the National Parks Shot in impecabile Time lapse and slow motion photograhy. It is artistically moving and a beauti to see nature and lots of moving water and sky going through it's changes ever so gracfully and yet powerfull. The  piece has no naritive and That IS Great for once, because none is needed here at all... Just matching compositions of Patrick O'Hearn Taken from Several of his Solo Albums that he seemlessly mated to the given visual landscapes. The highest quality has been rendered here for this genre, the bar has been clearly raised. Don't hesitate to aquire this work. It's great for relaxing to, working behind or even puting it on the Big screen and sound system at cocktail parties. Worth every penny!",1101340800,11,782,4.792592592592593
1825271,5,B000083C82,"This is one of the best of its genre. We can't give another person PEACE or a sense of wonder, but this dvd can lead someone you care about to places that help them experience a bit of that for themselves. I have shared this with many who have vacationed in our national park system seeking these gifts, and they are amazed by the quality of this experience. I never tire of watching it. If you are looking for more of this type of experience, ""Yosemite Lightdances,"" by Sterling Johnson, with music by Eugene Friesen, ranks right up there with ""Timeless..."" You might also want to take a look at ""Earth Scapes,"" an beautiful award winning dvd with cinematography by David Fortney. Another dvd I'd highly recommend along these lines, but with different subject matter, is the stunning ""Star Gaze, Hubble's View of the Universe."" It's unbelievably gorgeous. Another exquisite dvd is ""Real Sanctuary,"" a relaxing and captivating undersea experience with music by Hilary Stagg. This review is so positive, I guess I need to say that I have no connection with anyone involved in making or selling these dvds. I just enjoy sharing these wonderful discoveries that took me a while to find. They're too good to miss.",1071619200,23,1209,4.7894736842105265
1825272,5,B000083C82,"I just purchased TIMELESS photographed by David Fortney & scored by Patrick O'Hearn. This is brilliant stuff. The 45 min presentation sends the viewer into another dimension with a mesmerizing effect. Fortney does complete justice covering major National Parks within the United States & Canada. Using amazing camera techniques & time lapse photography, Fortney is able to create images never probably seen before ! I am a big fan of Patrick O'Hearn's music & in spite of some of my favourite tracks not being included, O' Hearn has done full justice to the score & the 5.1 mix which is a hidden feature in the menu section.",1064880000,12,624,4.841121495327103
1825273,5,B000083C82,"""Timeless"" is a DVD by photographer David Fortney and composer Patrick O'Hearn, with stunning scenery from US National Parks coupled with O'Hearn's highly cinematic music.
I've been a fan of Patrick's music for years, and this was just what I was waiting for - a chance to hear his music coupled with visuals, a match made in heaven. I have problems finding a musician who makes more picturesque music than Patrick; Fortney clearly made the right choice when turning to him.
If you've seen the opening credits of the movie ""White Sands"" from 1992, a film which Patrick scored, then you know how this DVD looks like - terrific recordings of deserts, oceans, waterfalls, mountains, forests and skies put to O'Hearn's music.
The music material is taken from all but two of his solo albums; ""Rivers Gonna Rise"" and ""Eldorado"" is not featured, probably because these two albums are a bit too ""poppy"" to fit with the visuals. But when that is said, I wouldn't have had problems finding a track from each of those too.
There is a couple of tracks I miss, like ""Devil's Lake"" and ""Sacrifice"" from ""Indigo"", but you can't have all. The last track on the DVD was a surprise to me, as long as I don't have the ""Ancient Dreams"" album, which this track ""Beauty In Darkness"" is taken from. That song is another Patrick O'Hearn classic, I especially love the end with those tender piano tones which segues into those last great words from Roosevelt.
A DVD for any music lover with taste and feeling. If you like this you should check out the ""Visions"" DVD from Spotted Peccary Music and Enigma's ""Remember The Future"" DVD.",1052870400,8,1607,4.681978798586573
1825274,5,B000083C82,"The images and his music are really exceptional...
Is incredible how the camera can gather so many details and is capable of placing in places full of mystery.
I recommended also for Patrick O'hearn's fans music. Last track is Ancient Dream beauty version, very ""So Flows..."".
Congratulations also to Fortney. WHAT A GREAT TEAM!!!!!!!!",1047945600,7,335,5.222222222222222

7978722,5,B000083C82,"I highly recommend this award winning, breathtaking music video of our gorgeous United States National Parks, by Filmmaker David Fortney. If you get goose bumps from taking in amazing panoramic views, then fasten your seat belt, this music accompanied video (music by  Patrick O'hearn), or narrative video will appear, feel, and sound magical!!! This video,  is so masterfully filmed, I can view it year after year and never feel bored. Some of the views create a sense of body movement from the aerial shots and are able to create a sense of motion sickness, the footage is so real. Be prepared for a total sensorial experience!!!!",1474243200,,632,4.952830188679245

7978724,5,B000083C82,Beautiful DVD with soothing music showcases some of our national parks. It gives you a soothing 'fly-through' some of the most beautiful scenery in the country.,1446336000,,160,5.1923076923076925
7978725,2,B000083C82,"I feel I owe it to people who really care about the production quality of this sort of material to post a much less glowing review than what other have said in these other reviews. I'm sorry I went with their recommendation, really.

If your standard of quality is from about 20 years ago, then you'll be fairly well satisfied with this DVD. Obviously I knew it was not a Blu-Ray, but even for a DVD the visuals are almost cartoon-like in their lack of realism. And worst of all, the video is in 4:3 format, so if you were at least expecting DVD widescreen (as I was) you're in for a huge disappointment.

Next big problem is the audio quality. I am a HUGE fan of Patrick O'hearn, and I own all of his CDs. So the idea of some of it being remixed to surround sound with great visuals was very intriguing. Well the audio is almost as bad as the video. Yes it's surround sound, but the re-mix seems clumsy to me, and the quality sounds like a low-bit rate MP3. The high end is so mushy is sounds like the music was put through a pasta strainer, and a few little clicks pop up here and there. I have a pretty high end system that is great with great material, so I know it's the disc.

Finally there's the imagery itself. If this same material had been captured with higher quality and reproduced in a better format, it would be good. Not great, mind you, but good, and the techniques and even some of the visual concepts are repetitive (like looking up through trees while circling the camera, for example). So in the end, most of my feelings while watching this disc were either frustration or boredom. Even if they re-released this title on widescreen Blu-Ray, I'd think twice about buying it again. This one was not even worth the ten bucks.",1436400000,2,1742,4.337423312883436

7978727,5,B000083C82,"Not being familiar with what to expect, for the fist few minutes believe it or not I was disappointed expecting a National Geographic or Discovery type video, packed with information.  But was soon mesmerized by the beautiful and almost meditative quality of the scenery, music and soothing poetic voice of the narrator.  Just don't watch this when you're tired because you might be lulled to sleep and miss it.",1422662400,,411,4.942028985507246
