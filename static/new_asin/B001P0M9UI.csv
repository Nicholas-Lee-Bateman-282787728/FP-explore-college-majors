This is followed by continuous dancing by a woman in gloriously beautiful costume making what I am guessing are terribly significant hand and body movements.  I suspect that the viewer is expected to receive some ultimately important messages that promote deep understandings about the universe and man's role in it, but all I could happily digest was the beauty of the dancer's costume.  It seemed to me that to appreciate this product, the viewer would need some prior knowledge not to purchase it, but to understand it.",1406937600,,752,4.905511811023622
