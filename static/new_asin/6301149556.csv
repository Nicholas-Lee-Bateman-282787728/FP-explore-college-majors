There's no way of knowing if it's accurate, but P.T. was a showman, so he might have liked it..  REALLY wish they'd put it out on dvd.",1497484800,,307,4.275862068965517

7810126,4,6301149556,"I always felt that this was one of Burt Lancaster's best films, but also one that never got the exposure it deserved.
P.T. Barnum was a showman and one of the highlights in the film are the scenes where Barnum offers a fortune and hires the famous singer Jenny Lind (often known as the ""Swedish Nightingale"") and her entire entourage to tour the United States for more than a year without ever having heard her sing. She earned about $350,000, and he netted at least $500,000 simply by promoting her talent; a talent he knew absolutely nothing about.",1386201600,2,550,4.622448979591836

7810129,5,6301149556,"I am prejudice because I own every picture Mr. Lancaster ever made but....even if I didn't I would have to say he is perfect in this part. (But what couldn't he play?) The wry smile and that twinkle of Burt's persona could sell snowballs to Eskimos! and so he creates a believable and entertaining Barnum for his audience.

I will not go into the story. We all know that...only to say if you have not watched this movie you are missing out on a really enjoyable viewing. For the whole family. I also enjoyed a longer version by A&E with Beau Bridges.

Get both these movies. You will not regret it!",1139443200,2,598,4.378378378378378
7810130,5,6301149556,"It is very appropriate that former acrobat and trapeze artist Burt Lancaster should play as Phineas T. Barnum, in a well-crafted biographic film produced for television with an adequate budget and a top-flight cast that helps to enable director Lee Phillips apply nicely focussed leadership in this treatment of Barnum's eventful life.  Action opens in 1883 as a circus performance is in preparation, with 70 year old Barnum, surrounded by acrobats, jugglers, animals and clowns, talking to the camera as he recalls (through flashbacks) a series of dramatized events that have brought him to this stage of his career (he discloses that he did not conceptualize of a circus until he had passed the age of 60).  We see young Barnum with his grandfather, Phineas Taylor (a solid turn by Michael Higgins) for whom the lad is namesake, as Taylor advises the youngster to always credit and honour imagination: ""the seed of genius, the elixir of life"", words that leave a lasting effect upon the impressionable boy.  Subsequent highlights include the larger-than-life entrepreneur's development of such attractions as Joice Heth, purportedly a slave of 161 years, diminuitive ""General"" Tom Thumb, Jennie Lind, ""The Swedish Nightingale"", and Jumbo, a gigantic elephant, eventually arriving at Barnum's business merger with James Bailey, resulting in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"".  The financial compact arranged between Barnum and Lind (Hanna Schygulla), who was aware of the value of promotional advertising and who therefore permitted him to retain 70% of the profits from her highly successful touring, is covered in some detail; however, there is simply too much fascinating content within this man's lifespan to do it justice with normal cinematic restrictions.  This is a splendidly mounted and costumed film that never flagrantly strays far from documented truth, and enjoys ably atmospheric scoring by Charles Gross and the skillful cinematography of Reginald Morris, benefiting a well-selected cast that gives nary a weak performance, Lancaster providing a magnificent turn as the showman with Schygulla a standout, as well.",1133049600,2,2125,5.40785498489426
