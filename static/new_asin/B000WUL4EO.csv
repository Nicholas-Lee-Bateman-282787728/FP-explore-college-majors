8225712,5,B000WUL4EO,I went to apparel design school and learned old school courture pattern making techniques.  I liked this book better than some of our college textbooks!,1481241600,,152,5.08
8225713,3,B000WUL4EO,"I have watched several videos by Sandra Betzina which are always in depth and very helpful. This video only covers copying a jacket without the sleeves. I wish there were other examples and not just a simple jacket.
Overall I like the tracing method. it is quick and very close to the original measurements.",1391212800,2,307,4.703703703703703
8225714,5,B000WUL4EO,"Sandra demonstrates effective, simple techniques for making a knock off. Instructions are easy to follow. So long as you're not in it for the cinematography, the content is excellent!",1221436800,5,183,5.344827586206897
8225715,5,B000WUL4EO,"I found this DVD very helpful. The first section of the DVD deals with making a pattern copy of a simple jacket and was mostly very clear. What I really like is the way Bezina and her friend Houlihan work together. They clearly explain what they are doing and how to fix mistakes and make adjustments in the process as they go along- how to cope with the sort of problems beginners are likely to have or the questions they will ask. There is a good, real-life feel to the instruction. On the minus side, i think they gloss over how to copy the sleeves of the jacket- the process i would find most difficult. However, the part about adding a sleeve to a vest was very helpful.",1199664000,12,675,4.28125
