2267768,5,B00096S2TQ,"this is a great legs and buns workout...i hvae become a big fan of Leisa Hart after doing her Fitmama Postnatal dvd and getting back into decent shape, and now her Sexy videos are really challening me to stay off the couch and crispy cremes and doing more to shed more weight and tone up this body. I was very lucky to lose some baby weight after a few months, but now i am losing the other weight that i put on thorugh years of bad diets and no workouts. Leisa is positive and upbeat, and this dvd works my legs and butt to a great burn, a great workout i feel all over. I stretch it out and don't feel sore or pained for days, i feel like i am toing up and doing what my body needs. Leisa is very fit and her talent is varied, one girl is bigger and more normal than the other fitness models, and she moves sexy and keeps me interested, cause if she can do it i know i can do it. This is a very good workout and is very effective, its well worth. It peaked my interest with the unique style of fitness, and it is really cool how Leisa puts different styles of fitness techniques together to make something so fun, and in this case, really fun!",1124668800,2,1145,4.026315789473684
2267769,5,B00096S2TQ,"this is a great cardio workout that shapes and tones the legs more than i was expecting...i loved the great feel of the video, it is a colorful sexy set with an aerobic ballet flare to it; Leisa Hart looks great and her attitude is infectuious, she is very good and i feel like this very is one of the best i have done in some time.",1123372800,3,332,3.970149253731343
2267770,3,B00096S2TQ,"I like all her DVDs and was eager to try this one, but I was disappointed because it was hard for me to follow her. And although I did have my sweat, I wish I didn't feel so out of sink with the steps. The DVD is an inspiration, she is wonderful, but I have a long, looong way to go before I get to move as easily as they do. If you are familiar with ballet moves, than you will probably love this workout.",1123286400,4,406,3.788235294117647
2267771,5,B00096S2TQ,"THIS IS A COMPLETE BLAST, I LOVE THE BALLET MOVES AND LOVE THE SEXINESS THAT LEISA AND HER CAST EXUDE IN THIS WORKOUT. THE BALLET SHOES ARE CUTE AND I CAN MOVE JUST AS EASILY IN MY TENNIS SHOES AND HAVE GREAT MOVEMENT. THIS VIDEO IS TONING UP MY LEGS IN WAYS I HAVE NOT SINCE BEFORE MY FIRST OF 5 KIDDOS! I LOVE THIS LAD Y LEISA HART AND FEEL VERY VERY GOOD BECAUSE OF HER VIDEOS, I TOTALLY ADORE HER STYLE OF TEACHING AND AM REAPING THE REWARDS(OR MAYBE MY HUSBAND IS :-) ) SI9NCE I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT MYSELF...THIS IS A MUST HAVE VIDEO FOR YOUR FITNESS PROGRAM, AS WELL AS SEXY ABS, A GREAT AB WORKOUT THAT HELPS YOU WHEN YOU WANT TO SHOW YOUR MID SECTION IN A SEXY WAY :-)",1122076800,5,682,3.949275362318841
2267772,3,B00096S2TQ,"I was really looking forward to trying Sexy Legs, as I tend to enjoy dance-inspired cardio as well as barre moves.  The outside of the DVD case does a nice job of breaking down the workout, listing time durations for each chapter as well each bonus segment.

The main workout is 37 minutes long, and it begins with a 5-minute warm up.  In this section, instructor Leisa Hart introduces some of the ballet moves that will be used in the workout.  Next, there are two segments of ""Ballet Dance,"" each 10 minutes long.  I really liked the types of movements that Leisa was doing--eg, I love doing plies, knee lifts, kicks, and leg extensions--but overall, I did not enjoy this section of the workout.  Specifically, I thought that Leisa moved much too quickly, and as a result, the exercises felt both rushed and jerky.  In addition, Leisa did not cue very well and often failed to adequately explain the ballet terms she was using; the poor camera angles utilized further exacerbated this problem.  In each 10-minute segment, she introduces several different moves and then combines them into a longer routine, which she repeats several times from the top; each segment has a total of two longer routines.  Surprisingly, I did get a good cardio workout trying to keep up with the pace of the moves, but I did not find the dance work to be at all enjoyable; ""fussy"" seems like the best word to describe it.

Following the dance segment, there is a 7-minute bar work section.  I expected this to be more focused on toning, but again, the pace was quite brisk, making it seem more like continued cardio work.  Leisa was difficult to follow here as well; even the background exercisers obviously were confused at several points.  The workout ends with a nice 5-minute stretching segment at the bar for a total of 37 minutes.

The DVD bonus features included several additional workout segments.  There is a 5-minute ""scarf dance,"" which is a slower ballet dance segment incorporating use of scarves; a 5-minute ""intense stretch"" which contains many of the same stretches from the main workout but without the bar this time; and an additional 5 minutes of bar work which is slower and thus has more of a toning emphasis.  Other DVD features include a sneak peak of the class from a camera at the back of the stage, brief bios on Leisa and each of the four background exercisers, a music only workout option, and a photo gallery (why would I want to look at poses of Leisa in various outfits?).

One final important thing to note about this workout is that Leisa and crew are wearing ""character shoes,"" a sort of heeled dance shoe that seems more appropriate to modern or jazz dance.  Leisa recommends that those at home do the workout in fitness sneakers, which is what I did, but this felt awkward with some of the ballet moves.  I really WANT to like this video, as I did feel it in my legs and thought that I got a good cardio workout overall--but after trying it only once, I don't think that I'm ever likely to do it again.  If you are already familiar with basic ballet moves and have a preference for quickly moving, complex cardio, you may like this workout, but otherwise, I am unable to recommend it.",1121817600,17,3203,4.605633802816901
2267773,5,B00096S2TQ,"i could not beleive how my legs were feeling, they were burnign just right, a good type of pain...i could tell i wwas working hard and getting my legs toned for swimsuite season....the ballet moves are classic moves and you feel very sexy doing the routine, its not a cheesy carmen electra wokrout, this is purely fitness. i loved the workout and am seeing results rather quickly which is the best review i could give this sexy legs video",1120521600,,438,4.556962025316456
8057450,4,B00096S2TQ,"I like it.  I have never done ballet before and is not good at it, but the purpose of the workout is to get you moving.  She might not be the best dancer but she gets your heart rate up if you follow the moves the best way you know how.",1253836800,,236,3.607843137254902
8057451,3,B00096S2TQ,If you even slightly have 2 left feet this video is going to be a challange to keep up with. The instructor uses dance terms and you'll learn a whole new vocabulary with this DVD! I had such a hard time keeping up and I've tried doing the video 3 times. It was discouraging to be honest. You'll begin each new move with her telling you the name but you spend all your time trying to learn the moves that you might forget the names. And when you get into combos all she does is tell you the names of the moves before you do them so if you've forgetten anything it's going to be a workout just trying to keep up! You better keep your eyes AND ears open. It's a good workout overall.,1181088000,2,680,4.044444444444444
8057452,5,B00096S2TQ,"this isa  very good workout, very good toning moves, i just loved it!!! and don't fret over the shoes, it is easy to move with leisa to this video, an absolute great dvd!!!",1153526400,,172,4.212121212121212
8057453,5,B00096S2TQ,"It is my third DVD from Leisa Hart and I'm glad to say that I am not disappointed. The workout is fairly challenging ( the moves may seem difficult for someone who never tried dancing ) and it will definitely take some time before I can move thru the routine as gracefully as the instructor does.. One thing was particularly important for me - after completing the workout, I could feel my muscles, but my knees were not hurting ( as they usually do after a ballet-inspired class - I have several DVDs on my shelf that I cannot use because of that ).

The only problem I had were my shoes - I used my trainers but I found they gave me too firm grip in some of the sliding moves.",1151452800,,678,4.136363636363637
8057454,5,B00096S2TQ,"get over the shoes girls, the workout is done to ballet shoes, but so what, i wear my tennis shoes and can move great, people that think it is weird seeing leisa instruct in those shoes are silly. i love the choreography, find the talent very graceful and their bodies are all different, not a bunch of skinny models, and the girl leisa hart can get your legs into shape, she is dynamic and her sexy legs dvd is uniquely superb.",1138320000,,428,4.296296296296297
8057455,4,B00096S2TQ,"This will burn fat on your legs for sure.  There are some ballet moves and regular style aerobic exercises to tone your legs.  The ballet moves are plies, releves, and chases etc to get legs long and lean.  But, Leisa makes it easy-to-follow by introducing new moves at half-tempo and using straight-forward cuing.  You can choose whether or not to do additional hops etc for extra burn.  The toning section is all standing barre work (you may need a good sturdy chair).  She also makes this fun and interesting so you hardly know (till the next day) that you were working out so hard.  Be warned! - you will be sore.",1133049600,5,617,4.504504504504505
8057456,5,B00096S2TQ,what a cool video! i really liked the way the routine was flowing with graceful yet intense moves. Different levels were shown and i could alter which level i wanted to do very easily. The production was very well done and i stay fresh and energized doing this workout.,1130371200,,269,4.510204081632653
8057457,5,B00096S2TQ,"i was not sure what to expect when i got this SEXY LEGS video, but after doing the routines a few times, i can feel the added strengt in my hips and thighs and i am getting some great cardio work at the same time; this is a fun and creative way to shape and tone your legs, and Leisa Hart is a great instructor",1129248000,3,310,3.7846153846153845
8057458,5,B00096S2TQ,"This is a very enjoyable video, I enjoyed the way Leisa put the moves together and the pace of the teaching. The ballet moves are effective and make the legs feel it for days, in a way in which I want to do it again and again. I highly recommend this video, it will make your butt feel, your thighs and hips, it is a wonderfully inspired video that makes me smile and sweat, a neat combo.",1126224000,,388,4.0519480519480515
8057459,5,B00096S2TQ,"My legs, and really my hips, buns and thighs, and my heart for that matter, REALLY FEEL GREAT after doing this routine. It is INNOVATIVE and FUN. I adore the great feel of the set and the dances are awesome. The moves are well choreographed and taught very well. Leisa Hart is great at giving modifications and the dances did different levels. My cardio is so much better now, and after also doing the SEXY ABS video and toning up my abs, I feel very very good about making these purchases. I have a new found attitude and Leisa Harts videos tend to inspire me to stay after it and work hard and work smart. This is a GREAT VIDEO.",1125273600,5,630,4.258333333333334
