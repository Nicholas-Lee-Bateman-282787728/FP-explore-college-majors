4984971,5,B006FKNC0E,"My grandkids love this an ask for it when ever they come over.  This is really good stuff, and I don't mind watching it with them. Sometimes have to explain.",1411948800,,157,4.233333333333333
4984972,5,B006FKNC0E,"My granddaughter started watching this series at age 5 1/2. As it started I thought it was going to be a major fail and ""baby-ish"", but she totally loved it. It really is very imaginative and reflects the fantasy world inside their growing minds. I like that there is not content glorifying precocious gender interaction. In other words it's not all about who likes which other boy or girl, or silly competing for the attention of the opposite sex. Not weird, not gross humor, not being smart mouths to each other or parental units. Good, clean, fun.",1389830400,,550,4.680412371134021
4984973,5,B006FKNC0E,Growing up I loved Bobby's World and to find it on Amazon is awesome!!! It brings back so many memories. I would so buy it if they came out with a DVD set...,1380499200,,157,3.787878787878788
4984974,4,B006FKNC0E,"Bobby's World debuted in 1990, as part of the FOX Kids lineup. It is also the longest running (in reference to how long it lasted, not how many episodes it had) FOX Kids show on the network, lasting 8 seasons and 81 episodes in total; although the DVDs being sold on Amazon has 7 seasons total...don't be alarmed, all 81 episodes are still presented. The show is about the very imaginative adventures of Bobby Generic (pronounced JEN-a-rick, not jin-AIR-ick...a running joke on the show). It was created by Howie Mandel (Deal or No Deal; current judge on America's Got Talent).

Don't forget to check out my reviews for seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon. Season 3 is back to the 13 episode format that Season 1 was. This season is presented on 3 discs: 5 episodes on Disc 1, and 4 episodes each on Discs 2 and 3.

Video Quality: 3/5

Season 3 marks a slight improvement in quality. Presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, as originally aired, the quality is more than presentable. As is the standard for most cartoons of the time, the show was edited on standard definition video. Quality is fairly clean and colors nice and bright for the most part. There are some noticeable scan lines during the intro, but not as bad as Seasons 1 and 2. I noticed some bad interlacing issues on a few scenes in Disc 3. Not sure if it's because of the source material, or a bad disc pressing.

Audio Quality: 3.5/5

The episodes are presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo, at 192 kbps. The audio quality is just fine, for the most part. It's very standard stereo quality that you'd expect from a 90's cartoon. Nothing more, nothing less.

The Episodes:

Here's what's included in the Season 3 DVD set, along with runtimes:

1. Bobby's Tooth Or Dare (20:37)
2. Bobby's Big Move (20:39)
3. Bad News Bobby (20:39)
4. Swim By Me (21:12)
5. The Play's The Thing (20:41)
6. Fish Tales (20:37)
7. The Music (20:36)
8. Misery Loves Company (20:40)
9. Ill Effects (20:49)
10. Bobby Phone Home (20:47)
11. Baby Brother Blues (20:35)
12. Bobby's Girl (20:33)
13. I Want My Mommy (20:34)

Just like Seasons 1 and 2, the episodes are PAL-sourced (4% speed up...see my Season 1 review for more information). Although, like Season 2, it doesn't affect the entire episode. In ""Swim By Me""'s case, it doesn't seem to affect that episode at all. The opening and closing segments with Howie Mandel, along with the end credits are presented in their proper speed. Despite the speed up, there are no cuts to report. All song performances are intact, too, so there are no music-related issues to report either. Everything is as originally aired. For the closing logo fanatics, there are closing logos for ""Alevy Productions"", ""Film Roman"" and ""Saban International"".

Wrap-Up and Recommendation:

Season 3 of Bobby's World is another fun set of episodes. The quality is an improvement compared to the first 2 seasons, but the speed up issues are still prevalent. Fans, no doubt, want to add this to their collection, but as with previous seasons, proceed with caution.",1332720000,,3016,4.682419659735349
