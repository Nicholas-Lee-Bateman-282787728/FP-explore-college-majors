2378634,4,B000A7Q1YC,"Ned (Haden Church) is a cynical, self-absorbed advertising agency executive. Stacey (Messing) is an idealist who writes for The Village Voice. They are set-up on a blind date by their friends and its love and hate at first sight. He's superficial and she's all about substance. She's a left-winger and he's a self-proclaimed ""no winger."" Sounds like the perfect couple, right? Ned and Stacey was a short-lived sitcom that developed a small, buy loyal following. They have now been rewarded as Sony has released the first season of the show on DVD.

It's amazing that this show was even aired let alone lasting as long as it did - two seasons in total. The premise alone must've been problematic for the network: two self-absorbed people getting married for all the wrong reasons. Like the characters in Seinfeld (which is also set in New York City), the characters in Ned and Stacey don't particularly care if the audience likes them and that's what gives the show its edge. For example, in one episode we see the cutthroat world of corporate America first hand as Ned gleefully rubs it in a rival's face that he got married to get his cushy promotion over him. There is a sarcastic attitude that is prevalent throughout the show and a welcome alternative to the shiny, happy people of most other sitcoms. Ned and Stacey would go on to become even more surreal as one of the main cast would be killed off in an episode only to come back in the next one.

With these kinds of things going on, it's not surprising that people like Alan Ball (American Beauty, Six Feet Under) and Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) would eventually write for the show before it was prematurely cancelled during its second season. Ned and Stacey may have been a classic, opposites attract story wrapped in a sardonic package but it was too acerbic a show for mainstream audiences. Fortunately, this DVD has been released so that its fans can enjoy what was produced during its brief stint.

There is a retrospective featurette entitled, ""Strings Attached: Ned and Stacey, Season One."" Thomas Haden Church, Debra Messing, Greg Germann and Nadia Dajani are back for brand new interviews as they reminisce about their experiences working on the show.

There is also an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by series creator Weithorn. He ends up fleshing out some of the comments he made in the featurette (i.e. casting Haden Church and Messing) with some decent anecdotal information on this low-key track.",1127347200,13,2528,4.844907407407407

This si one of the most awaited DVDs in my life, and it finally has arrived.

2378642,5,B000A7Q1YC,"Ned and Stacey only lasted two seasons but it is still a great comedy worth to take a look again and again. Thomas Haden Church became an Academy Award nominee for the film, ""Sideways,"" and Debra Messing would succeed in another comedy series, ""Will and Grace."" In this series, Ned and Stacey have an unusual marriage arrangement for business reasons. Ned needs a wife to get a promotion in his company while Stacey is yearning to the live in New York City and escape her parents' suffocating environment in the New Jersey suburbs.

Ned and Stacey are opposites which works great to the advantage of the series. Ned is serious about his profession in the advertising game. Stacey is an aspiring writer and journalist herself. They meet in the pilot episode on a blind date arranged by Stacey's brother-in-law Eric Moyer (Greg Germain) and his Stacey's sister, Amanda Moyer (Nadia Dajani). Dori Brenner and Harry Goz played Stacey's parents mostly in the first season. Eric and Amanda are also opposites in character. The two couples have terrific chemistry onscreen and the laughs keep coming.

Sadly, the series lasted only two seasons on Fox in the mid-nineties. The cast would go on to other projects as well. Thomas Haden Church would earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for the film, ""Sideways"" and other accolades. Debra Messing has just been awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television, Emmys and has returned as Grace Adler in the updated version of the comedy, ""Will and Grace."" Greg Germain would act in the hit series, ""Ally McBeal."" Sadly, Dori Brenner died in 2000 from cancer. She was a terrific actress in any medium. I wished there was a tribute feature to her in this DVD collection.

Guest stars include Joanna Cassidy, Susie Essman, Olivia Newton-John, Jason Bateman, Kathy Griffin, Marcia Cross, Megan Mullaly, Sara Rue, Christopher Hewett, Alex Trebek, Lloyd Bridges, Corinne Bohrer and more. I loved the Thanksgiving episode best of all so far. It is a classic Thanksgiving episode entitled ""The Thanksgiving Day Massacre."" Another favorite is the flashback episode when Amanda told Stacey to break up with Joe in high school. Eric is playing the diner busboy and Ned appears looking like Joe Dirt.",1511654400,,2259,4.955145118733509

2378655,5,B000A7Q1YC,"Ned & Stacy was a victim of FOXs shoot from the hip fear. (Proved foolish by many other shows.) Though without their premature cancellation Thomas Haden Churchs Oscar Nominated Sideways wouldnt have happened and Debra Messings Will & Grace wouldnt have happened.

That said, this is a wonderful collection because it contains eleven episodes, all great, that have never been aired. Creator Michael Weithorn managed to bring beautiful closure to the series despite the elenth hour guillotine. The second season, seen here for the first time, pulls Ned out of the office a bit and focuses scenes at the Muffin Shop that Amanda and Ned bought together. This becomes the Central Perk, Cafe Nervosa, Monks Cafe for Ned & Stacy allowing all four characters to play off each other together (far fewer scenes at the restaurant from season one that Stacy sets on fire after abusing Olivia Newton John.) It also allows the addition of a few semi-regulars as customers and employees. All of whom are stellar.

The cast: Not since Cheers has a central cast been so gifted and bonded. Tom Church, Debra Messing, Greg Germann, and Nadia Dajani are as brilliant as Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Pearlman, and Woody Harrelson. Thomas Haden Church is a mind so BRILLIANT that one can never know what to expect or whether hes gone off script- even in episodes written by Charlie Kaufman. (Oh, yes. The writing staff is also stellar.) Debra-well, we ALL know her skill though Stacy Colbert is a very different character than Grace Adler. Shes far more ethical, far more strong, far more sloppy, but just as over the top. Greg Germann is funny in a skilled, well timed, hysterical way that balances like a scale against boisterous Church. The gem is Nadia Dajani, who can go from sweet to bitch in 5 seconds, and is the common sense character surrounded by loonies and out of love is often pushed to the brink.

The series could have run another season but the future was predictable given the finale. Where it was left was creatively twenty-five years ahead of its time. Not all stories are wrapped up with a bow like Friends, Roseanne, Wings, Cheers, or Frasier. Our imaginations are left on our own for follow through more like Breaking Bad.

Weithorn used a brilliant and hysterical tag for each episode in which the envelope is pushed and the fourth wall cracked, always choosing a moment from the episode- a subtle but expandable moment- thats never been done.

We were sad when Church left Wings but this more than makes up for it.",1507593600,3,2519,4.781609195402299
2378656,5,B000A7Q1YC,"I spent my formative years watching a lot of TV, and at some point during the late 90's vivid memories of watching the hilarious blowhardiness of Ned on 'Ned and Stacey' were burned into my brain. I don't remember if I saw this show as it originally aired or in some form of syndication, but it has always stuck with me as a forgotten favorite of the 90's sitcom era. The stars of this had much more successful sitcom hits with 'Wings' (Haden Church) and 'Will & Grace' (Messing) around the run of this show, but in my 90's sitcom-influenced opinion, the writing and chemistry on this show far surpasses those other shows in spite of a lackluster premise and dedicated following.

Season 1 was previously released on dvd, while season 2 seemed to be lost forever, though I was able to track down a low-quality torrent that included the 11 unaired episodes and reminded me of the hilarity of this show and how, whether it was intentional or not, I grew up with a messed up sense of humor and backward morals influenced by the character of Ned Dorsey. In my limited knowledge of technology, years ago I dedicated time to uploading all of season 2 onto Youtube for others who were forced to live a decade and a half without one of the greatest forgotten seasons of 90's sitcoms, only to have them taken down after copyright claims that hinted that a full series like this might finally become a reality.

It is truly awesome to have both seasons in one set, as season 2 builds on the first season beautifully, leaving the only disappointment of the series that it didn't continue. I can tell you the final episode does what series finales of other 90's sitcoms couldn't do -- make you wish there was more, while at the same time leaving you tearful and smiling at the investment you've made in growing to love these ridiculous characters. The supporting roles of Eric and Amanda interact with Ned and Stacey in such a hilarious way that you sense the actors loved these scenes and lines in spite of, again, a rather silly and ridiculous premise for a show. The way the show never takes itself too seriously (especially in opening and closing credit scenes and numerous guest star appearances) is a thing of sitcom beauty, and therein you see the influence that famed writers like Charlie Kaufman and David Litt had on the sitcom world early in their Hollywood careers.

The special features on this set are limited, but about what you would expect from a series that only lasted two seasons and was cancelled by network execs that saw poor ratings rather than the deep connection these actors made to their characters. Since seeing this series as a teenager I've followed the careers of Haden Church and Messing just to see if they could ever match what they had here, and I'm not sure they've done it yet (Haden Church in 'Sideways' is a tangential version of Ned). This series is worth your time and money.",1506816000,5,2905,4.59344894026975
2378657,5,B000A7Q1YC,"As usual Shout Factory puts out another great set. this time for the series Ned and Stacey. The set features six discs. Three for season one, and three for season two marked as season one disc one  through three and then season two disc four through six. I am not sure if this one done on purpose or a misprint in the art work. When we open up the package the case is clear, and an episode guide is listed on the reverse of the artwork. They even make note of which episodes were unaired. This again lists the discs as mentioned above. The disc artwork is nice, colorful, and different for each disc. The only downside is that you have to take the discs out to read the guide.

Putting a disc in we get a Play All as well as an episode list while the theme song plays. Disc one features the extra. There are eight episodes on disc one.

 the back of the package mentions all 46 episodes so that includes the 11 unaired ones. The set also includes audio commentary on the pilot and a retrospective.",1506384000,10,997,4.231578947368421
2378658,4,B000A7Q1YC,"Ned and Stacey was a short-lived sitcom and could have lasted longer. Thomas Haden Church (Wings) was best known as the dimwitted airplane mechanic in the NBC sitcom and Debra Messing was coming into her own before her ""Will and Grace"" success. The cast is first rate with Thomas Haden Church as ambitious advertising agent, Ned Dorsey, who needs a wife to get a promotion. Then comes Stacey Colbert, a liberal ideal aspiring writer, who wants to get out of her parents' home in Tenafly, New Jersey. So they make a deal to get married in quick ceremony.

The first season has twenty four episodes on three DVDs. There is a one featurette about the making of the series. The series only lasted two seasons. I'm waiting for the second season on DVD. In the first season, there are plenty of notable performances especially Nadia Dajani's role as Amanda Moyer (Stacey's sister and Eric's wife). She was terrific in the role as the wisecracking older sister. Greg Germann played the ideal hen-pecked husband, Eric Moyer.  Greg Germann would go on to ""Ally McBeal"" among other roles. Germann and Dajani were perfectly cast in playing the sister and husband. Ned and Stacey hang out a lot with Eric ""Rico"" and Amanda for the entire first season. The parents are played by Harry Goz (Sol) and Dori Brenner (Ellen) but we only see them in half of the episodes.

My favorite episodes are the ""Thanksgiving Massacre"" and ""New Year's Eve"" among the twenty four here. It was a terrible shame that the show was canceled after two seasons. I wished the second season would come out on DVD too. Guest appearances in the first season included Joanna Cassidy, Olivia Newton-John, Jason Bateman, Kathy Griffin, Alan Oppenheimer, Lisa Edelstein, Kathleen Noone, Natalia Nogulich, Paulina Porizkova, Allison Smith, Loretta Devine, Susie Essman as Aunt Ceil in the Thanksgiving Episode, John Slattery, Pat Summerall, Claire Stansfield, Bibi Besch, Ellen Albertini Dow, James Karen, Farrah Forke, John O'Hurley, Bill Macy, Fred Sanders and others as well. This was a smart, funny sitcom.

The saddest part of the sitcom was seeing the New York City skyline before September 11, 2001. The show aired in the mid-nineties so they show the old skyline to viewers. It was a beautiful skyline and sadly reminds me of life before that terrible day.",1492473600,,2319,4.908163265306122

2378660,4,B000A7Q1YC,"Lacks bonus content, all we get is a retrospective with Thomas and Debra and a commentary on the pilot episode.

""Ned and Stacey"" debuted in 1995 on FOX Broadcasting Company. Thomas Haden Church had just been released from his contract at NBC, and Debra Messing was approached. The series is about an advertising executive and a freelance writer who agree to a marriage of convenience, he gets a promotion and she gets an apartment. However, these two do not like each other and often insult one another.

Season one is a riot from the faux marriage to Ned dancing in a gay bar with Rico (Greg Germann). The episodes are struck from HD masters of the film elements so they should look good on any TV. The only thing that I do not like is Sony removed the TriStar logo from all the episodes. In fact one episode if you listen closely the first note of the '93 TTV logo can be heard.

Messing is well-cast as a bubble-headed, going-nowhere-fast woman with loose morals and an overbearing sister. All in all, it's 90s comedy at its best.

I hated the ending, I would have ended it differently. Judging by how it ended, it's pretty clear the writer was a bit bitter about it's cancellation. I relive the nostalgia many times over, much to the annoyance of my bf lol. I loved everything about it, however, looking at it now, I can see that perhaps Stacey's ""immature, parasitic, self-absorbed naivety"" was a tad overacted, but that's okay by me. I loved Ned, the self centered jerk that he was. But razor sharp wit, the same goes for Amanda (she makes me wish I had a sister). That goes double when those two trade barbs lol. Ned and Amanda were my favorites, alone or together ""in combat"". Rico was cute too, in his gentle nebbish, Smithers-like sycophantish way (I actually know someone just like that). The homo-erotic undertones between Eric and Ned toed the edge of overkill without actually crossing it. It was a subtle humor to me to see Stacey in the moments she is acting like she rolled right off her bed and right onto the sofa, all spread out, dressed slovenly, appearing in full slacker mode while her hair and makeup were perfect. The rating is missing a star because the DVD case arrived damaged: the little spokes (or teeth?) in the center of the case that holds the discs in place were all but gone. Just by removing the sealed DVD set out of the package and I could hear the discs skittering around. That's never good. Who knows how long it has been sliding about in transit? No bueno. Could have used more special features like stills, bloopers, etc. But did enjoy the  ""where are they now?"" featurette...I somehow was led to believe it was going to be a reunion where they were interviewed together instead of separately, but I still liked it. I was disappointed to learn the episodes I most wanted to see weren't even on that season, but was on S2 (my favorite episode is ""Fifteen A-Minutes""). My disappointment was compounded with the remembrance that season 2 was never released and most likely never will.

2378675,5,B000A7Q1YC,"You could say the 90's was the golden age of the single camera sitcom, and Ned and Stacey was a good example of what the form is capable of achieving. The writing is really sharp, and the cast gelled quickly. This ampersand show was about cynical ad executive Ned Dorsey (Thomas Haden Church) and idealistic journalist Stacey Colbert (Debra Messing) entering into a marriage of convenience. Ned needs a wife to impress his boss into giving him a promotion over a competitor who is already married to an accomplished cocktail party hostess (John Getz and Natalija Nogolich are a hoot as this couple). Stacey wants to move out of her parents' house and Ned has a great rent-controlled apartment overlooking Central Park. They are introduced to each other by Ned's work buddy Eric Moyer (Greg Germann) who is married to Stacey's sister (Nadia Dajani). The early episodes are about Ned and Stacey working out their boundaries. She agrees to socialize with his business prospects, but he quickly realizes he can't manipulate her the way he does almost everybody else in his life. This becomes especially clear when she pursues a big story that puts one of his clients in a bad light (""Cover Story""). ""Take My Wife Please"" has in jokes for anyone familiar with Church or Messing's previous work (at the time he was known for playing handyman Lowell on Wings, and she was known for a popular Nice and Easy commercial featuring an Aretha Franklin song). The season starts with them both discreetly dating other people as per their agreement, with all of the farcical elements that implies, but this being a romantic sitcom, they start developing more complicated feelings in time for the season finale. So why did it only get two seasons? It was a combination of being on a network notorious for letting its best shows die young, with its lead-in being a show in an entirely different genre, and with stars who were at the time untested in lead roles. Under those circumstances, it's a testament to the show's quality that it made it two whole seasons.",1425168000,2,2044,4.793201133144476

It's what I love about Seinfeld.
Thomas Haden Church gets to show us a very different side as he plays a character that is completely different than his role on Wings. And Debra Messing is also very good as his 'wife'.

2378723,5,B000A7Q1YC,"I distinctly remember this show as being the first of very few 'appointment television' -type shows to dot the landscape of the TV-watching aspect of my life.  I looked forward to every single episode of ""Ned and Stacey"", loved the show, & was bewildered & seriously bummed when it was cancelled.

Having a humorous premise is one thing (& on the face of it, the premise of this show is practically ripe for humor), but to be able to take it in multiple directions, let alone come up with so many plausible potential scenarios, issues, & 'consequences' -- given the premise of 2 people who irritate each other, but get married & live together so that each can gain something of specific importance -- required intelligence & creativity, & skillful writing & execution.  The writing was terrific, & the acting by the 4 principal actors (as well as others, for that matter) was fantastic, & topped off by the chemistry between them, collectively rendered each episode a wonderful, interesting, & humorous look at various 'what if(s)' associated with the lives of 2 strong-willed people contending with the constraint-filled & what-others-expect-to-be-true-and-assume-of-two-people-who-are-married circumstance that they themselves created, & about which only 2 others in their inner circle know the truth.

Along the way, the various comical scenarios end up illustrating some irony & various truths about people, & relationships (& marriages, in particular), that make for an all-the-more-interesting ride when taking a 'trip' through Ned and Stacey -land... Also, & which is seemingly inevitable when it comes to various people who don't actually take the time to get to know one another, but then spend extensive time around each other, you see ~hint-like occasional moments when Ned & Stacey seem to come to a better understanding of each other, & while they won't admit it, they gradually start to have a bit of respect for each other, & the formative element of a friendship is ultimately 'there' despite the 'best efforts' of each to think they couldn't possibly like the other.

I've just watched episodes of this series (the entire first season) for the first time since it was originally broadcast, over 15 years ago, & the humor holds up so incredibly well, all these years later.  I am delighted beyond words to be able to watch episodes of this show again, & in watching the first season in a kind of 'marathon viewing session', was reminded of just how rare it is for me to find *any* television series which makes me laugh out loud & smile so much.

I hope like crazy that Season Two is ultimately made available -- not only for those of us who watched the series when it was originally televised, but also for those who either didn't happen to catch it the first time around, or weren't able to (for some, due only to the fact that they were children at the time [& not old enough for a show with a premise involving marriage], let alone those who were not yet born).  Studio head honchos & decision-makers -- please, please, please make Season Two available on DVD.

Thomas Haden Church has always been in a class by himself, & his unique & significant impact on this series is a comedy wonder to behold.  While I liked him in ""Wings"", I absolutely loved him in ""Ned and Stacey"".  Similarly, while I liked Debra Messing in ""Will & Grace"", I enjoyed her far more in ""Ned & Stacey"".  Additionally, Greg Germann, who I've enjoyed in many projects over the years, was terrific in this series (among so many things, there are times when he has to 'turn on a dime', perceived allegiance -wise, & he is able to convey so much [& comically so] with just a quick change in his facial expression [at times followed by some well-delivered accompanying line]).  And Nadia Dajani, who I've seen in various projects since ""Ned & Stacey"", is fantastic as Stacey's sister, who thinks Stacey is nuts to have entered into a 'fake marriage', & to boot, Nadia's character can't stand Ned, suffers no fools, & 'tells it like it is' -- albeit with such skillfully delivered lines & accompanying facial expression & body language, & to great comedic effect.

Lastly, the limited special features with the Season One set are interesting & fun.

Thomas Hayden Church (""Wings"") and Debra Messing (""Will & Grace"") starred as the title characters in this hilarious ""Occasional Wife"" remake which ran on Fox for two short-lived seasons (1995-1997). Canceled midway during its 2nd season run, ""Ned & Stacey"" later resurfaced [in syndication] on the USA cable network's ""US a.m."" block, where devoted viewers (myself included) finally got to see all of the unaired episodes. It was also on USA where most viewers who missed the show in first-run on Fox first discovered the series. Now, thanks to Sony, the show's complete first season is available on DVD.

Digitally remastered in High Definition, Ned & Stacey - The Complete First Season is a 3-disc (535 min.) set featuring all 24 episodes; Full-Frame (1.33:1) video; Dolby Digital Stereo English audio; Closed Captioning; Episode guide insert; plus the following Special Features: ""Strings Attached - Ned and Stacey Season One"": A 20-minute retrospective including all-new interviews with the cast and crew; Commentary: On the Pilot by series creator Michael J.

All I can honestly tell is that TV is just a boring pit, from my very particular point of view, that way I can understand why this sitcom never gained any good rating. It seems clear that brilliant, creative and good dark humor didn't mean anything in the nineties, not even now. Hayden and Messing were so perfect, the dialogues, the performance, the situations !!!....

(No offense but Will and Grace is so cheap and mundane compared to N&S !!! ..... N&S beats that show even in the gay jokes !!! ....but that's only my opinion)

I wish the whole two seasons were available...........it would be worth all the way..........

Serve Yourself !!!",1151193600,4,709,4.648
2378752,5,B000A7Q1YC,"N&S was one of my absolute favorite sitcoms of the 90's. Seriously. I really, really loved it. So did the critics, if I recall....but unfortunately, not enough viewers shared the same enthusiasm, and it only lasted two seasons. I can't believe it was virtually unknown, even in it's day. It had edginess I believe could be compared to Seinfeld (maybe even better). It's characters had dynamics (and jokes) that I believe could BEAT ""Will & Grace"". All the characters had something to contribute to the show. My favorite was Ned. I adored him. Thomas Haden Church wore his role's attitude like a fine, Italian suit. His impeccable, RAZOR SHARP wit...dispensing wisecracking, poison-tipped sarcasm with deadly accuracy (trust me, it's a lot funnier than it sounds!!)

Well, maybe not ALL the characters contributed to the show...For those who have seen the show: Do you remember around the beginning of the show, Amanda and Greg actually had a kid?? He was a little bratty-like kid with coke-bottle glasses, he didn't really do anything for the show....then several episodes later, he just disappeared without even a mention of what happened??

Anyways, when I saw what I (much later) found out was the last episode, I was real sore. All I can say is: if you have a TV show to pitch, and FOX gives you an offer, run don't walk. It's the kiss of death!! They will mangle the show beyond recognition, they'll under-advertise (then blame you for the low ratings), they'll endlessly move your show across the programming schedule like a chess piece, they'll push you aside to give attention to a crappier show just because it has a ""big"" name. It's unfortunate, tragic that N&S was a casualty of such treatment.

Sorry for the rant....heh...anyways, for those who are unfamiliar with this show: This show is bursting at the seams with intellegent jokes/characters and saucy wit. If you enjoy Will & Grace, I'm pretty certain you too will fall in love with Ned & Stacey.",1140393600,14,1963,4.87125748502994

There are only a few shows I remember that really did it for me and this is definitely one of them. The hilariously stoic facial expressions of Thomas Haden Church and the interactions between him and Rico are incredibly funny. Its the nonchalant humor that made this show one of the best. Debra Messing as Stacey ... its Grace before Grace existed! Nadja Dajani as Amanda taps into the parts of us that may think something, but don't necessarily say it aloud. She does! All the cast of the show, the writing, the situations...combine to make one great comedy. I wish it lasted longer...but again, it was way ahead of its time. People didn't appreciate this kind of humor before. Buy IT!",1130025600,6,775,4.58273381294964
2378754,5,B000A7Q1YC,"If you like Will and Grace, then you are sure to enjoy this sitcom that played for two seasons in the mid-90s.  My roommate and I were obsessed with this show during college.  I was actually very surprised and excited to see it come out on DVD considering it was never hugely popular.  That's one of the sad things about television today...the truly good shows like Ned and Stacey are overlooked while drivel like Life According to Jim last multiple seasons.

The premise of Ned and Stacey is simple.  Ned marries Stacey to get a job promotion, and Stacey marries Ned so she can have a place to live and move out of her parent's house.  The catch is they barely know each other, and what they do know of each other, they don't particularly care for.  They are both allowed to date other people as long as they are discreet and don't let certain people know about the 'arranged' marriage...namely Ned's co-waorkers and Stacey's parents(who incidentally adore Ned and Ned them which leads to a very humorous episode).  Stacey's sister and brother-in-law(Ned's best friend and co-worker) know of the arrangement and make some humorous sidekicks for Ned and Stacey.

What truly makes this show great is the chemistry between Debra Messing and Thomas Haden Church who play Stacey and Ned, respectively.  They just play off each other beautifully.  Granted, they argue most of the time which leads to many humorous moments, but they do get along in their own way...sometimes.  This show is not about a couple who hate each other...as Ned and Stacey definitely don't hate each other.  It's more about personality-clash in close living-quarters.  Ned is a neat though sometimes morally-ambigious character while Stacey is a slob who likes to think of herself as morally-superior...Ned often throws this in her face mocking how such a moral person could ever get involved in a 'fake' marriage.

Anywho, this was definitely my favorite sitcom of the 90s.  I was highly disappointed when it was cancelled am ecstatic to see it out on DVD.  I can't wait until the second season and last season comes out.",1128643200,27,2092,4.831460674157303

When Shout Factory released the complete series I was ecstatic.  I still enjoy the show, it is more corny than I remember, but still makes me chuckle.  The one thing that does bug me though is the video quality...the show is grainy, like watching an old video tape...which I can understand...but the pixelation when watching the video takes away from my enjoyment.  I would liken the experience to watching a HIGHLY compressed video on the internet.  I am not going to guess on the technical reasons for this.  I wouldn't let the video transfer quality prevent you from purchasing this set if you are a fan of the series, I don't, but I am disappointed in the quality.",1520294400,,940,4.520710059171598

8075878,5,B000A7Q1YC,"Finally! A complete series DVD set for a show I thought had been sadly forgotten. The packaging is really nice and quite sturdy, with the discs in no danger of falling out like some recent releases. I would've liked the episodes synopses in a separate foldout, but the print on the box interior itself is fine, and I won't complain about that small arrangement. The artwork is wonderful and has a very professional look. I'm just simply happy to have all the episodes in one place. Such a silly and fun show, and wonderful to see again!",1517875200,,536,4.536082474226804

8075880,5,B000A7Q1YC,"I often ask myself how abysmal shows like Friends run for 8 seasons, yet shows like Ned & Stacey somehow find a home with only a small group of people and make it one or two seasons.  This is one of my favorite shows from my childhood.  I watched this and Wings with my parents and it brings back great memories.  Also the show is just genius. Sure, it's cheesy, but so was everything else on TV in the 90s.",1516752000,,407,4.0625
