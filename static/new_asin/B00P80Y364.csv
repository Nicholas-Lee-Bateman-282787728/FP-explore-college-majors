8686737,4,B00P80Y364,"This docu-drama was a little slow and seemed to be a little low budget but excellent information. Whatever quality issues existed was made up for in the information provided. This dvd demonstrates how the church adapted and transformed pagan tradition into the celebration of the Resurrection - explains how culture, emperors, apostles and popes have influenced how we celebrate Easter today. The program features dramatized scenes from the gospels along with documentary footage shot in the Holy Land and at the Vatican, plus insightful commentary from church scholars and historians. Gary Wilkinson directed this documentary as well as others - similar topics, similar attention to historical information/detail. I believe he and others (actors, narrators, etc.) are from the UK as they have a British accent. Gives the presentation a European perspective. Whether it's European or American really makes no difference - facts are facts regardless of who presents. It's just interesting to hear the accent. :)",1461024000,,1010,5.480769230769231
