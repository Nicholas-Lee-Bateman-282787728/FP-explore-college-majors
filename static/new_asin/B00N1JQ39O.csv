6606184,5,B00N1JQ39O,"Shirley is magnificent as always, what a charming treat this movie was.  Elsa's character is spirited, fun, spontaneous and wisdom filled, which frankly only MacLaine can deliver.  I hope to see more movies depicting sweetness and romance in the golden years of life...staring Shirley MacLaine of course.",1415750400,,304,5.446808510638298
6606185,3,B00N1JQ39O,"I have to give this film three stars out of love for Shirley MacLaine, Christopher Plummer, George Segal. Fantastic players. The scenes with Segal and Plummer were the best, Shirley is great. I could not get past some obvious problems in the directing, camera work and the script.

Note Spoilers ahead...Shirley's makeup around the neckline was apparent in some shots and whatever padding was applied seemed to restrict her, she seemed older than the men and looked uncomfortable. Let Shirley be herself...don't mess her beautiful self up with bad makeup and a much younger wig.
Marcia Gay had some very good minutes.

I wish a good story written for fantastic older actors, would be put together better. More like a ""film"" than a splashy and awkward, cheesy Hollywood movie. Some scenes were kind of ridiculous and simply did not work as well, I did not like the scene in the restaurant...do you think these two older people could actually move that fast, and I doubt Plummer's character would allow her to pay the bill, didn't hold up. I don't like they were stealing.

I was a bit offended by the Trevi Fountain scene, it just seemed a bit strange, her sudden death (did the dip in the fountain kill her?). The best part was the son turning over the drawing (was it real?). That was an upbeat moment that added wonder. However the hair should have been blonde in the drawing.",1415491200,2,1378,4.70954356846473

6606187,5,B00N1JQ39O,Extremely Charming and touching film. Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer were engrossing in their roles as two elderly people who decided to live life to it's fullest .. Great overall cast .,1415318400,16,196,5.15625
6606188,1,B00N1JQ39O,"okay, we have seen a lot of movies so far trying to either reminding the old the male or female farts not to give up hope to have a possible second spring of the their lives or still got the chance to have wet dreams or, a fair warning to their younger offspring to have some heart to their old ones not to take for granted that their old folks were just sitting or lying in their rooms awaiting the final call from the heaven or the hell, they were still having some sexual desires to meet an old opposite gender and to have a good time.

save it, will you? because there's no need to paint a lovely and hopeful picture for the old and dying generation. the possibility of meeting someone so late is actually zilch. life is not such easy way to have some fun once you are standing at the bus stop or bus station, with fuzzy and blurry eyesight, loose teeth, weakened hearing, shaky knees, dizzy and drowsy head, numb senses, etc., and etc., hoping that you might still got the chance to have a late stage or final encounter of romance. that's just pure crap!

this movie is just another untruthful, ridiculous and stupid drama that could only happens in a movie. when an old fart's bathroom medicine cabinet piled up so many medicines that you have to take on a daily,  duly and timely schedule, you don't need to add one romance dosage to cheer you up and feel alive and young again. you just wish after taking so many pills everyday, you don't get kidneys stones or kidney failure and worst of all, a chronicle constipation. this film is the ultimate insult to the old and dying generation.",1415318400,2,1593,4.375
6606189,5,B00N1JQ39O,"What a pleasure to watch a top-notch 2014 American remake of a top-notch 2005 Spanish film. ""Fred y Elsa"" won the Golden Space Needle Award a few years ago so we happily lined up again for the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival screening of this new version.

Director Michael Radford, working with scriptwriter Anna Pavignano, has enlisted a gold-plated cast for this predictable and utterly enjoyable story. ""Predictable"" isn't always bad, there are times we have a pretty good idea where we are going, but we also know we are going to enjoy every step of the way getting there. On the other hand, who could have predicted that broken pipe?

We watch:
  * Christopher Plummer (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" 2011) is curmudgeonly Fred, recently widowed and moved against his will from his home into a small apartment where he is stuck with an in-home health care worker. (How in the world can a man Plummer's age be so handsome!)
  * Shirley MacLaine (""Downton Abbey"") We first meet Elsa when she backs into a car owned by Fred's son-in-law that's parked in front of the apartment building. His skateboarding grandson witnesses the incident so she tries to swear him to secrecy. She has no more than a passing acquaintance with the truth, but wait until she finally takes Fred out to a fancy restaurant. You'll laugh!
  * Marcia Gay Harden (""The Newsroom"") is his daughter Lydia, anxious to get him settled and determined to keep that strange new neighbor away from her ""poor old"" father.
  * Chris Noth (""The Good Wife"") is his son-in-law Jack, always with a new get-rich-quick scheme.
  * Scott Bakula (""Behind the Candelabra"") is Elsa's wonderful son Raymond, successful, loving and wryly supportive.
  * Erika Alexander (""Last Man Standing"") is Laverne, that unwelcome in-home health care worker. She is wise and patient.
  * Wendell Pierce (""The Wire"") is Armande, the manager of the building where our folks live. Watch the look on his face when he figures out what's going on....

The point of the movie is that it's never too late to enjoy life. These people do not try to pretend that they are anything other than their own age, they are frankly over the hill and have made their peace with it. We should all be so wise...",1414713600,59,2242,4.766839378238342

Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

I was so looking forward to this movie, but halfway through it, I actually considered turning it off. In general, I really like the old folks get a second chance at love movies, but this one really fell flat.

A lonely widower and a kooky, slightly older vivacious woman hit it off. Newly Oscar-ed Christopher Plummer and an always delightful Shirley MacLainewhat could go wrong? The bad news: the plot went wrong. The good news: there was nothing wrong with the veteran actors performances.

If you're a hopeless fan of either actor, youll probably end up seeing this one. After all, I did. But its really not very good. Christopher Plummers character just doesnt make any sense; hes cranky, hes hopeful, hes lusting after his maid, hes in love with Shirley MacLaine, he couldn't care less about Shirley MacLaine, hes capable, hes getting senileSee what I mean? And Shirley MacLaines character is one feather shy of a loon. Shes grandiose and full of life, and for absolutely no fathomable reason other than new blood she pursues her neighbor. She recreates the classic fountain scene from La Dolce Vita and expects the fuddy-duddy to break free of his shell and join in her eccentric behavior, when hes made it perfectly clear he has no such intention. I struggled to understand her character as well, and let me tell you, when you're battling confusion from both leads and boredom from the plot, its not very fun.",1498435200,,1471,4.76078431372549
6606220,5,B00N1JQ39O,I enjoyed this movie very much! I never get tired watching this sweet story again and again! I'm watching all of Shirley MacLaine movies.

6606319,3,B00N1JQ39O,"Plummer and McLaine are a good pair. The story line was a bit of a fetch, but interfereing children still hold true. I've seen both actors in better roles.
I guess what this director was shooting for is romance for the elderly. As we age, the package is not as great as
it use to be, but the person inside is still there. So what if one was once a beauty. It's what's inside that counts for lasting relationships
or new ones. Living in isolation as most elderly do, even with family around, conversation with people that have something in common
is something to  take risk for. This is an endearing story, Give it a watch.",1461542400,6,622,4.362068965517241

The script is predictable and trite.  The character of Elsa is supposed to be zany and engaging.  But what do you make of a woman who backs up into a car smashing its headlights and then drives away, telling the boy who witnessed it not to say anything.  This is supposed to be cute?  What's wrong with me -- I found her reprehensible.  And didn't like her any better watching her drive around paying no attention to the road.  And her ridiculous and utterly vain fantasy regarding that fountain in Rome just made me dislike her even more.  There was nothing whatsoever engaging about her character -- the writing for her part is a total fail.  Christopher Plummer did the best he could with the hackneyed role of a morose curmudgeon who is brought back to life.  I don't even know why I sat through this to the end.

This would have been good back in 1950, but nowadays people expect a lot more from a serious film.

It is fun to watch how Fred (Plummer) decides not to quit on life and, in the end, he stands up to his fly-by-night son-in-law.  He is an exceedingly handsome man, even in his senior years.

This is a lovely movie about two elderly people falling in love that will most likely not resonate with anyone under 70...more is the pity. It deals with the problems of ageing: when children become the parents; when people simply grow weary of life; and finding a bit of happiness when you think such things are no longer possible.

Elsa, holding on to a dream all her life, is given the chance to live that dream by Fred, her old curmudgeon neighbour, and he in turn allows Elsa to show him that life is not over just because you are 'old'.

6606833,5,B00N1JQ39O,"From director Michael Radford, comes from his co-written story of an elderly pair finding a togetherness that just may work. A remake of the past Spanish language film of the same name, ""Elsa and Fred"". Elsa Hayes (Shirley MacLaine) and Fred Barcroft (Christopher Plummer) begin quite separately but are eased into a lovely pair proving that it is never too late to find love and companionship at any age and magic can happen under the oddest of circumstances or accidents. I found this couple's chemistry absolutely believable and it inspired a view of love in a relationship that has no age constraints or limiting boundaries.

Elsa has been living in a starstruck daydream for so long; some sixty years. A nostalgic reverie of herself in the past of Frederico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" is well thought-out by Elsa. The only change is that she has replaced Marcello Mastroianni along with Anita Ekberg in the scene at the Fontana di Trevi. She has longed for her one and only love to join her there in the scene, a part she has recreated for herself and still dreams of fulfilling. Raymond (Scott Bakula) is her adoring and prosperous son and their connection is happily a state of the heart. The apparently overprotective daughter of Fred is the indignant Lydia (Marcia Gay Harden) who would rather see her father away from his home, which now is too large, and in an apartment complex. She just heaps more indecision into his already stayed beliefs while leaving him to understand her decision as pure nonsense at first. She is integral in having her father move into a small apartment with a home healthcare worker, Laverne (Erika Alexander), from the home he does not want to leave after being widowed. Fred is crabby and Elsa does not appear to care about that while being positive and effervescent at times.

In New Orleans, these two meet in the apartment complex, and under a humorous situation. An accident perhaps? At a point, they do finally go out for a meal. The warmth of laughter ensues, besides being under a shower of real relationship fireworks that are quite palpable to all. Elsa is not your quiet type of woman as she can be very persuasive and even a bit childlike. She still loves and dreams and I appreciated this about her role. You couldn't accuse her of just sitting still and watching time pass by, not whatsoever. As for Fred, he gets encouraged to live his own life again while helping Elsa to do the things that she has only dreamt of in this entertaining romantic comedy.

I appreciated this film very much as it teaches that love is not only present for the younger set but for all that stretch out their arms to embrace what life may bring. Live life to its absolute fullest and be who your loveable self 'Really Is'. Watching veteran actors MacLaine and Plummer, on the screen together completely filled my heart and made me feel even more for the pair they portray. This also boasts a great supporting cast that lifts the couple even more so, if that is possible.  A don't miss for those who can easily understand what love really is and that it doesn't depend on age or lifestyle, but people. For me, this particular movie could be rated in smiles in lieu of stars: Just these two people who took the time to connect all of the dots...",1421280000,12,3274,4.639655172413793

Christopher Plummer was fabulous in his role, appropriately old, appropriately grumpy, and he exuded a certain sexiness as he came out of his shell. Shirley MacLaine is a great actress in her own right, but she was ill suited for this role. With all her talk about love and fantasy, her characterization of Elsa never developed beyond being the savvy senior lady that lived next door to the old curmudgeon.

A romantic comedy for the older crowd, it does not seem like such a stretch. After all, look at all of the baby boomers crowding the stage. I would bet many olders are engaged in whoopie.

In this film we have Elsa, a woman prone to great exaggeration, played by Shirley macLaine, in a terrible wig, and brusque, Fred, played by Christopher Plummer. This should be a film made in Heaven, and for some it may very well be. I found it tone deaf. Fred's wife, has died in the past 6 months and has moved to an apartment. His daughter has hired a caretaker. Fred lies in bed most of the day with no purpose in life. Enter Elsa, a divorcee, except she tells everyone her husband is dead, and maybe she is not divorced at all. She goes for dialysis, so we know she is ill. Somehow a romance develops, and Elsa's dream of visiting the scene of 'La Dolce Vita' her favorite film comes to the fore.

Many family members appear with well known actors, but not enough to give this film any zing. Even the city of New Orleans is not enough. The best part is Dr John singing 'Step One' in the closing credits.

Okay For Some. prisrob 12-20-14",1419120000,3,1140,4.268518518518518
6606979,4,B00N1JQ39O,"ELSA & FRED is a love story.

Its a story of two lonely old people who meet, circle each other for a bit, and then fall in love.

Curmudgeonly Fred (Christopher Plummer) lost his wife seven months ago.  It really wasn't a great loss, because he was miserable in the marriage, but now his daughter (Marcia Gay Harden) has moved him into a new apartment where all he wants to do is lie in bed and vegetate.  Then, he meets Elsa (Shirley MacLaine), his next-door neighbor.  Shes an outgoing kook who, among other things, has a problem with the truth.  Indeed, it seems that virtually everything she tells Fred about herself is total fiction.  Could any two people be more perfect for each other?

A remake of a 2005 Spanish-Argentine film of the same name and directed by Michael Radford, ELSA & FRED is a charming romantic comedy with a touch of pathos.

The cast, particularly MacLaine and Plummer, is marvelous, and includes Chris Noth, Scott Bakula, George Segal, Wendell Pierce, Jared Gilman, Erika Alexander and James Brolin.

I didn't realize until over halfway through the picture that most of it was shot in New Orleans, which immediately made me wonder why none of the characters had any sort of Southern accent.  But, thats a minor point.  You will enjoy this movie.

The Blu-ray from Millennium Entertainment contains a Making of featurette.

6607064,4,B00N1JQ39O,"This is one of those films you want to love - strong lead actors and a solid supporting cast showing another homage to aging gracefully. But the cake was left in the oven a bit too long and the resultant `romantic comedy' becomes so Hallmarky that the script drowns the fine intentions of the actors. Written by Anna Pavignano and Michael Radford (who also directs), the story is given its best shot by Shirley MacLaine (age 80) and Christopher Plummer (age 85) but the saccharine ending is a bit too heavy to hold up the good moments.

Set in New Orleans, the story introduces two people who at the end of the road, discover that it's never too late to love and make dreams come true. Elsa (Shirley MacLaine) has lived for the past 60 years dreaming of a moment that Fellini had already envisaged: the scene in 'La Dolce Vita' at the Fontana di Trevi. The same scene without Anita Ekberg in it, but with Elsa instead. Without Marcello Mastroiani but with that love that took so long to arrive. Fred (Christopher Plummer) has always been a good man who did everything he was supposed to do. After losing his wife, he feels disturbed and confused and his daughter (Marcia Gay Harden) decides that it would be best if he moves into a smaller apartment where he ends meeting Elsa. From that moment on, everything changes. Elsa bursts into his life like a whirlwind, determined to teach him that the time he has left to live -- be it more or less -- is precious and that he should enjoy it as he pleases. Fred surrenders to Elsa's frenzy, to her youth, to her boldness, to her beautiful madness. And this is how Fred learns how to live. When he learns about Elsa's terminal illness, he decides to make her dream come true and takes Elsa to Rome to reenact with her the famous scene at the Fontana di Trevi.

The supporting cast includes Scott Bakula, George Segal, James Brolin, Chris Noth, Wendell Pierce,  and Erika Alexandra (in the most entertaining role as the `housekeeper' for Fred). It has its moments and it always is a pleasure to see MacLaine and Plummer no matter how lame the script's ending. Not exactly the reincarnation of Fellini's La Dolce Vita, but an entertaining movie.

6607065,3,B00N1JQ39O,"""Somethings are priceless."" Elsa (MacLaine) is an older woman who isn't happy with anyone or anything. When recently widowed Fred (Plummer) moves in next door the two become fast friends. The friendship develops into more and the two find out that it's never too late to find love. Until Elsa's life turns out to not be what Fred expected. The first thing I have to say is that this was a pretty good movie. Plummer and MacLaine have great chemistry but that is to be expected from two legendary actors like them. The fact that those two are in it is the reason that the movie rises above being a cheesy cookie cutter love story. There really aren't any real surprises in this and goes pretty much how you would expect. All that said I am 35 and this movie isn't really geared toward me at all. I'm sure an older crowd will relate to this better and they will probably find it more enjoyable than I did. Overall, a movie that was OK and I liked it but if I was 40 years older I probably would be able to relate to this better and love it. I give it a B.",1416096000,2,1053,4.192118226600985
