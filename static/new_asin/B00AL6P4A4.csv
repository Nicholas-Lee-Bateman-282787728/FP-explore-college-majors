5448363,5,B00AL6P4A4,"The documentary is rich in great content, that speaks on different topics such as the wrongful imprisonment on young black men, education, melanin, Egypt, global African presence, Black economics, and many more topics that the Discovery Channel, BBC never speak about on black African and African American people. This is a MUST-HAVE DVD that black and colored families around the world should have to know why society is at it's current state right now.",1355097600,39,454,5.148648648648648
5448364,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I went to the premier of this film at the Cinema Village Theater in New York City with a sold out crowd of people and others standing in the back of the theater for 2 1/2 hours to view the invaluable knowledge contained in this film. Tariq Nasheed and other scholars provide nothing but factual and scientific information pertaining to history and cover numerous topics from healthcare to the prison industrial complex with pure facts, wit, and occasional humor. A must see for anyonyone who cares to learn real history and not the watered down versions constantly played on the History Channel. I personally respect the veracity of Tariq Nasheed and his fellow cast members and I can't wait to add this DVD to my collection of real, personal history. We need more films like Hidden Colors to mentally edify people instead of the usual predictable hollywood nonsense which keeps people mentally stagnant. BUY THIS DVD!!! IT'S WORTH IT!",1355097600,79,935,4.886792452830188
5448365,5,B00AL6P4A4,"This historic documentary is profoundly informative. Tariq Nasheed/Elite aka King Flex pulls off a spectacular presentation, once again, in which he combines extremely great minds from the disciplines and perspectives of the African/Moorish American community to centralize and bring forth a plethora of pertinent information pertaining to the purposefully hidden history and truths concerning the worldwide African/Moorish Diaspora. This film, along with Hidden Colors Part 1, needs to be required viewing within the curriculum of every predominantly African/Moorish school in this country and abroad. If you are an African/Moor and you are looking for what you have been missing all of these years (a true knowledge of self without the tint of a skewed white-supremacy bias), please do yourself as well as your friends and family a favor and purchase Hidden Colors parts 1 & 2.",1355097600,41,879,5.470588235294118
5448366,5,B00AL6P4A4,"The heavyweights assembled in this film are nothing short of legendary.  Phil Valentine, Tony Browder, Claude Anderson, Booker T. Coleman, Umar Johnson plus more....
This is a film that once is over you don't know what hit you......and leaves you wanting more.
If you don't have the Hidden Colors series in your library then I would even question your motives as a person of color.",1355097600,69,381,4.861538461538461
5448367,5,B00AL6P4A4,This is a documentary that should have been made and told years ago. I am proud to be a Black Man and I am proud of Tariq Nasheed for telling it like IT REALLY IS! The Hidden Colors will no longer be Hidden from its people AGAIN! Peace!,1355011200,44,236,3.9375
5448368,5,B00AL6P4A4,"This documentary along with the HC1 doc is a must have for those Africans of the Diaspora and truth seekers globally of all ages.

5448371,5,B00AL6P4A4,Excellent chapter 2 to the series I would suggest to start with the first installment this has a terrific way of bringing information to the Forefront that is readily available a lot of it I already knew however if you are not Afrocentric then you will enjoy a lot of the information that come too light. there is a lot of fact checks that go on behind the scene so the historical information is authentic. opinions are like anything else it's an opinion however there is a lot of facts that go along with the information you can verify. I highly recommend it.,1501459200,,560,4.446601941747573

I need for them to understand that there have been so many lies told until it makes no sense. When those people decided to lie about practically everything, did they not realize that the truth would come out eventually and they would be found out? How in the hell can you take a people from their land, make them learn your language, make them worship your god and expect them not to ever be able to freaking read and write?

This is the information you won't learn in American public school. Information they don't want you to know about yourself. Another excellent video from the Hidden Colors franchise. I actually met Dr. Boyce Watkins and I perform a great deal of African historical research on my own. If you are of African/Black descent, you absolute MUST have the Hidden Colors set in your African library. I really only became aware of many of these topics about 2 years ago and I already have many books and DVDs to further educate my family, friends and myself about African identities. This is another MUST SEE video. I loved all the information and I plan to watch it over and over again because there is so much information to gather.",1466899200,,869,4.64935064935065

triumph or science of melanin a bit in the beginning but then went to talk about history (again some of which was in the first edition). Over all I did like it; but, I feel they could have touched more on melanin. There is a fact in the movie on melanin related to drug use...

5448482,5,B00AL6P4A4,"Black people worldwide are under attack and this DVD vividly points out the state of warfare being waged against black people the format of this DVD is excellent these are the categories that are included WHAT IS MELANIN, CULTURAL WARFARE, THE GLOBAL AFRICAN PRESENCE, THE AFRICAN PRESENCE IN ASIA, THE AFRICAN PRESENCE IN THE EARLY AMERICAS, SPIRITUAL WARFARE, MEDICAL WARFARE, PRISON INDUSTRIAL WARFARE, ECONOMIC WARFARE, AND SOLUTIONS I like the idea of SOLUTIONS being the last category, it shows that this war we're engaged in as black people can be won. I have had the privilege and good fortune to attend lectures given by several of these MASTER TEACHERS they are BOOKER T. COLEMAN, JAMES SMALL, AND RUNOKO RASHIDI. I especially like the DVD section where these MASTER TEACHERS state that Africa is constantly portrayed negatively in the media I have been to Africa on vacation 5 times Kenya twice Egypt twice and South Africa once and I know for a genuine fact that Africa has no jungles as you've seen in the many Tarzan movies. And that is 100% correct Egypt is in Africa the MASTER TEACHERS talk about this in the DVD I especially like what Brother Runoko Rashidi has to say about this, if you want to know exactly what he has to say you will go to amazon.com and buy this DVD, sit down with your children, teenagers, or even grown adults and watch this educational DVD.",1420675200,,1382,4.738589211618257

5448525,1,B00AL6P4A4,"So much of African American and Native American history is purposely left out of school curriculms and it really saddens me because people NEED to know about everyone's history, not just European history. We are getting cheated and people buy into this brainwashing. I applaud Nashid for trying to fill in the gaps because this opened my eyes and made me realize how much is lacking from history in schools and colleges. Everyone, regardless of race, color, ethnicty, needs to see this.

*****Edited*****

I'm editing this review and dropping it down to one star because I've since found out that Tariq Nasheed is appropriating Native American culture and identity by teaching the bs pseudoscience of Black Americans being the real Native Americans without using any shred of scientific fact. He's also misrepresenting Native American history by lying. I will no longer support him because I don't support Black Americans who marginalize other minorities by exercising Black Supremacy over them. This makes us no better than white supremacists. Black Americans are not indigenous to the Americas period. The fact that we still share the exact same genetic makeup as Africans means we've only been in the Americas less than 400 years. Use scientific facts so these errors aren't committed please!!",1410739200,3,1296,5.196172248803828

5448544,4,B00AL6P4A4,"An excellent resource for scholars to research.  The problem here is that the scholars are so bent on discrediting Jesus the Christ that they lie about certain historic events, like the First Council of Nicaea, and the use of the letter 'J.'  The scholars completely overlook the Coptic Church, started by the Apostle Mark in 70AD, and the Ethiopian Church, formed in the first century by the Ethiopian eunuch baptized by Stephen the Evangelist.  All these things were recorded in the Book of Acts.  So there is really no need to even discuss the Roman Catholic church. It whitened Christ up, like Europeans whiten up a lot of things that come from African people, like classical music, rock n' roll, and now hip hop and R and B.  Unfortunately, these scholars reject Christ, who was an African man, by the way.  However, we should not come to Christ because of the historical fact that He was Ethiopian, Nubian, African, or whatever you want to call it.  We must come to Him because He was and is the Son of God sent to redeem the world, and He will return and reign forever.  Those who accept will be with Him for eternity in Paradise.  Too bad the people in this film reject Christ and lie to the viewers in the process.",1407974400,,1223,4.5227272727272725

I found this documentary aligned with things I have determined merge with what I believe and historical facts. I love that these DVDs were not bogged in religion and the participants in the documentary molded their information around facts and left much open for self study and for one to contemplate.

5448636,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I watched Hidden Colors 1 and this is the perfect continuation to the hidden truths about our history. I think it's a vital piece of work for children, up to scholars studying Philosophy. I find that contextually, it is vital to any frame of study whereas we can truly juxtapose it against mainstream ""education"". It will allow us to really frame the realities of history, and the strides made to keep it hidden. I found it to be quite empowering. In my own study, I found several areas which I used to analyze, and critique; for example, it helped frame the Asian American experience in America. It is no longer hidden knowledge that the Other in society is EVERYONE. All Asiatic, Pacific, Native North/Central/South Americans, & Middle Eastern peoples are indeed people of color. It also supports the fact that ALL peoples are from Africa-even Europeans who, having lost their melanin to the cold, and who, thus developed a calcified pineal gland, are still from one central place. If children-Black children understood how fortunate they were to have the advantage of a working pineal gland, which fosters their connections with the cosmos, I think this empowering piece of information would support confidence in their studies and confront what society tells them-that they are bad, and will never amount to anything...it's time that we are honest about how our children are systematically brainwashed into believing that they cannot do well, based on standards which are unfounded, but used to label, stratify, and subjugate our children into the belief that they are not smart. It becomes imperative that our children know that they are not only smart, but have inherent knowledge, and connection to the metaphysical realm which grants them a greater propensity to acquire understanding in the sciences, math and other subjects.",1390348800,,1834,5.096345514950166

5448654,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I am currently getting a MA, so yes I have been in school for a long time and I think it was during my undergrad that I just got so sick of shcools telling me about what others did, and how when it came to us we were just slaves. I never believed that even back in middle school and started learning just to pass the classes through out my education. Then I started asking why does it seem the whole world is agains us? What is it about us, that everyone has a problem with? what did we do? I just always had this inner feeling that somthing was wrong. I started to notie things more as I learned.  I had this drive to seek,  I wanted to know more. I even challanged my proffs, and somtimes they penalized me for it, and some praised me for knowing. Academic honsety- I don't even know why that word is still used in institutions. I also had alot of friends who were from other countries both black and whites who told me things, that we have ben taught over here wrong. I even had a proff admit that the answer to my question. So I started to google that idea. I am being trained as a counselor currently, and I have stummbled across some interesting facts about how we are also victims pschologically-example-I always have to scout out black dolls for my kido, and everytime she watches T.V she notices how black kids, if any are in the video, are in the back or shown less. I mean its everywhere, the tests you take in school are meant for some to fail, the lessons they teach are meant to condition minds, and the books are well, full of crap! I mean the more I learn, the more I see that the answers to my questions are litterally right in front of my face. I am dark skinnd, so of course I am going to see it before some, hell we have always been vicimized litterally by everybody. I bought part 1and it made me want to share so I had a group myself. I Just watched This one, in additon to part 1. Excellent. It's definatly got me researching some more topics. I always knew somthing was up even as a kid, and I have always been connected to that cosmo idea of melonin. I see peoples ora, feel their energy and so forth, I always have, I just never knew what it was until now, thanks to you all.

I had no proof other than the DNA that was used to map the great migration the first humans made out of Africa. I put two and two together and concluded that if the world was populated by Africans then why aren't their any artifacts and signs of this, why isn't there any hard proof other than DNA. Because it isn't advertised. This is the best collaboration of all the evidence around the world of African presence. I recommend this movie to anybody.

5448728,1,B00AL6P4A4,"I'm saddened to see how, in yet another manner, racism has affected the critical thinking skills of my black brothers and sisters who reviewed the DVD; has led them to make knee-jerk reactions to the corrupt social practices of those who migrated out of Africa to the northern hemisphere. Such is the insidious and pernicious nature of the disease called racism.
Brothers and sisters---the difference in skin color is, from a scientific view, an evolutionary necessity to protect against harmful UV radiation in the equatorial zone and for enabling more efficient absorption of sunlight for Vitamin D production in the temperate zones. The superstitious assumption that black skin gives a superhuman
advantage to those who retained the dark pigmentation is as wrong-headed as the assumption, so strongly believed in by racists, that lighter-skinned people have an inherent intellectual advantage over their darker-skinned cousins.
God does not prefer any of His creation over the other based on skin color. Rather, He looks at the ""color"" of the heart; in other words, the criterion of acceptability is based on spiritual virtues and the use of those virtues on behalf of all of humanity. The misinterpretation of the ""Curse of Noah on Ham's descendants"" from Biblical lore, is mainly due to reading the story literally and not seeing the metaphorical aspect of ""The Curse"". The misunderstanding of the Books of Religion over the centuries has only served to stimulate and water the tree of ""Prejudice based on skin color"". Science and Religion are in harmony, according to one of the principles of Baha'u'llah, the Prophet-Founder of the Baha'i Faith. A scientist who puts forth an hypothesis that the races are fundamentally different is not a true scientist. To quote from one of the Baha'i Writings entitled ""The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah"" it states: ""O Children of Men! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over another...."". This statement alone provides the spiritual underpinning of the fact that humankind is One. (The Qur'an states in surah 96 a similar theme). Science, from a different angle, is now proving the oneness of humankind. Any pronouncement by a religious figure, or a scientist, that contradicts the religious theme and the scientific evidence of this Oneness, is simply based on quasi-science or pseudo-religion. The first few minutes of the video showed immediately the wrong direction its writer, producer, and participants were headed in on the theme of the origin and evolution of humankind. Growing up in Jackson Mississippi in the 50's and 60's, we black people even grew up believing that lighter-skinned blacks were better in many ways than darker-skinned blacks. So, what does that say about the ""Triumph of Melanin""? Religion in its Pure form, whether it be Islam, Christianity, the Baha'i Faith, Buddhism, and all the other Religions, provides a path to Understanding our true nature. So, please people---I beg you not to react to racism with silly myths and highly questionable assumptions. Melanin is just a chemical that helps to add other degrees of beauty and variety to the ""Garden of Humanity"". (Aaron in Portsmouth, NH)",1373068800,20,3216,5.151051625239006

However, within the present state of affairs, it's weakest link (by design-racism, supremacies, conspiracies, fear, oppression, etc. ) is the ethnic group that we have come to know or lable as the African and it's global descendants. In order for the human race to truly thrive within the folds of love, harmony, respect, intrinsic value, and peace, it is imperative that all resources, concentration, and focus are set on the task of strengthing it's ""areas of improvements "" (i.e. it's weakest link).

The first step of this reinforcement process would be to identify the problems that currently affect this link's stability. As it turns out, both ""Hidden Colors 1 & 2"" not only outline several relevant and key issues involved here, but they also provide tangible and conclusive solutions for those issues as well.

It isn't that I feel the information isn't worth it - it's invaluable, in fact. The participants should be compensated for their years of research and study. Greater than that though, is a need to spread the information as far as possible and I don't think it is priced for widespread distribution.

We need to host a viewing of this every week to all of our young men and women to get them back to skills, trades and business. Anything to make them put down the guns!!!!! Instead of trying to correct them in the small errors that were made (we are all human)we should take away the BOLD and STRONG knowledge that is put out to us and APPLY it to our lives NOW.

5448820,5,B00AL6P4A4,"What a wonderful DVD. It's so good to know that someone else is taking up the challenge.  Most of the information in the film, I already knew because I have been studying and traveling for 64 years.  I never had the money or opportunity to reach as many people as I hope ""Hidden Colors 2"" will.

I would like however to say that Trucannini was not the last Aboriginal Tasmanian.  This is another trick used to exterminate from the human record, the existence of indigenous people. Indians have this problem too.  I would suggest that Tariq Nasheed see the two disc set ""The First Australians"" written and produced by Aborigines. I learned a lot about Aborigines during my 13 years in Australia and when working with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra.

I'd also like to add that as concerns Hawai'ians you will find that many will tell you that they are definitely African--the Japanese came later.  How do I know?  On a visit to Hawai'i, I booked into a hotel.  I was married to an African from Kenya (lived there 10 years) and my last name was ""Kaloki."" When the receptionist saw me and looked at my name she asked whether I was Hawai'ian and I said ""No.""  She told me I had a Hawai'ian name.  I insisted it was African (this was in 1973) She said, ""We have people over here whom we call Kanakas and they look like you.""  We also have a god named Kaloki.  You might want to look into that sometime. I've had many of these experiences.  I also have compiled a 134 list of countries (1996) in which blacks are indigenous and I match mine against Tariq's with each ""Hidden Colors"" DVD that comes out. I'll close by saying thanks for doing what I could not do on as expansive basis as you have.  I have however started teaching private students, since I fit into the 60-70 year old teachers who still remember how it's done.

5448832,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I purchased this DVD aftering listening to Tariq Nasheed on the ""Zo What"" morning show on rmconair.com.  My husband and I watched it last night and enjoyed it immensely.  We were so excited that we told all of our friends and family about it.  This film revealed many historical facts about our African heritage that we didn't know existed.  For example, it talked about Africans settling in the Mexican area where it is widely believed that the Aztecs were the original settlers, but showed statues of Africans who lived there much earlier than the Aztecs.

It was also refreshing to see images to back up everything that was discussed and to not just hear someone talk about it in a lecture.  It was heartbreaking to find out that when our African brothers and sisters come to the United States, they are told not to associate with us African Americans and are shown nothing but horrible images of us as a scare tactic.  This film left me and my husband thirsting for more films such as this.  All we have ever heard about is the Civil Rights Movement and Slavery.  It was uplifting to find out our history beyond slavery and Civil Rights.  There is so much more to this than we ever dreamed of.  We can't wait for Tariq Nasheed to make Hidden Colors 3!  This is a great teaching tool for our son.  If you don't have this DVD, I can't stress to you enough how important it is and how great it is.

5448835,3,B00AL6P4A4,"I learned a lot from this DVD, but I would appreciate it if the authors could cite their sources. For example, the claim that the Egyptians were Africans is too broad. My understanding is that the first Pharaohs were Arabs but later dynasties were African.
The claim that the term Moor is used to indicate that a person is African is dubious. I have been to Spain and stayed at the Alhambra in Granada and admired the Grand Mosque in Cordoba. These and other buildings were the work of Moors, who are the people of Morocco, which is a country on the Mediterranean Sea south of Spain. My dictionary says that the Moors were a mix of Arabs and Africans and were Muslims. They were better educated and more tolerant than the Visigoths who previously ruled all of Spain. When Los Reyes Catolicos came into power they held an Inquisition which required that all Muslims and Jews had to convert to Catholicism or be burned at the stake.
It is true that Europeans lived in barns and Paris was a swamp when Muslims were translating the works of Plato and Aristotle into Arabic.
Finally, what is your source for the magic of melanin? My dictionary says it is a dark pigment in the body of man and certain animals. My cat is a tortoise-shell cat(aka calico). Does she have melanin? She is very smart.",1359331200,2,1290,4.517094017094017

It's so refreshing to hear this information after a lifetime of negative programming about who we are, what we are, and where we're from.  Someone needed to produce this video for the sake of our people, and I'm glad these filmmakers stepped up to the plate.  Freedom begins in the mind.

Not to give it all away, but not only will you find out that our history did not begin with slavery, and that history literally began with us, but that the worship of a deity that is depicted as looking nothing like us has been a huge detriment to our collective psyche and racial self-esteem.  I didn't realize how damaging that has been until watching this video.  The religion piece was the main stand out for me, but the entire video was incredibly informative.  The MLK/Gandhi connection was also mind-blowing and flies in the face of popular history.

Also, the widespread acceptance (and welcoming) of blacks around the world (who were called Moors back then) up until the growth of the Transatlantic slave trade is a fascinating part as well.  Expect to watch it multiple times to digest it all - there's a lot of information being presented.  My only criticisms of the video, and they are minor ones at that, was that not many sources for this information were cited so that a person could go and do their own research.  I'd especially like to find out more about melanin specifically, and would love to read more about it.  But maybe I missed where that was disclosed.

5448854,5,B00AL6P4A4,"Spoiler Review!!!!

Tariq Nasheed, AKA King Flex!!! Has done it again with an even better movie than the last. I like how this movie talk about the triumph of Melanin, and why it is important. The historians in the movie go through so many topics about what happen in the past. I like the one about the African presence in Asia, cause we often see the light colored Asians, but never really see the dark colored Asians. Many of the dark Asians are so black that you can see the African features they never lost, due to the isolation from the rest of Asia. These Asians stick to their home area never getting involve in wars or interbreeding. They even explain how around 6000 years ago Asians and Africans interbreed to create Native Americans, Mexicans, and others, yes these were the Folsom people archeologist refuse to talk about. Yep Asians!!! Your ancestors too was one of the first to travel to America, and there is a mountain of evidence to prove this!!! Asia is the second African cilivization also.

I like how the topic of about blacks in prison was discuss, because people need to know the truth about this, and it should be a well know fact that there are more blacks in prison than they were in slavery before the Civil War today. Black families have never been the same when too many black fathers and sons are kept in prison. Black Wall Street(Many rappers talk about this in their rap), in Tulsa Oklahoma, was a city full of black businesses that every black person should be educated about. It was a forgotten history many people don't know about, but thanks to Hidden Colors 2 it is now known in great detail. This city in Tulsa Oklahoma was destroyed by racist who flew an airplane and dropped dynamites blowing up the city with many people killed from it. The song: ""She dropped a bomb on me,"" was a reference to that tragedy.

Despite the many topics that was discuss in the movie, the ending had a better solution than the first Hidden Colors.  Tariq, and the rest of the people in the movie told their solutions to this problem of racism. It was all about having a community of African Americans, Africans, and blacks all over to help each other out like how other cultures do to each other. They even made it clear that we as black people should not hate other people, despite the racism. The legendary rapper KRS. One, will have you all dying out laughing throughout the movie too. You will love what he has to say about Black history. I encourage not only black people to watch this movie, but other people as well. Everybody deserves to know the truth, because we are all brothers and sisters. Even though racism still exist in all cultures, we just have to give each other tough love.",1357862400,10,2714,4.521384928716905

5448858,5,B00AL6P4A4,"If you liked Hidden Colors 1 you will definitely love Hidden Colors 2. This movie provides an enormous amount of information. You get a quality movie with excellent production. From beginning to end you have great documentary from leading historians on world history. If you want to know the roles of African Americans in the development in the world this is your movie. This is the best documentary I've seen to date!

Salute from Port Arthur, TX",1357603200,2,447,4.805194805194805
5448859,5,B00AL6P4A4,"As if Hidden Colors 1 wasn't great enough, Hidden Colors 2 ups the ante tenfold!  Absolutely unbelievable the information provided in this documentary about the truly hidden color (black).  From truths about the origins of religion, the widespread presence of blacks all over the world prior to Columbus, the hiding of the true history of Egypt, Gandhi's true feelings on black people and his unwillingness to fight for them, the prison industrial complex and how it has targeted blacks.....this documentary is an onslaught of black - HUMAN history, a gold mine of information that you just won't get anywhere else.  I will be watching both films again and again just so soak up all the information presented.

Many of the same speakers from the first film are here, as well as a few others who only add to the WONDERFUL cast of knowledgeable brothers and sisters (KRS-One as usual was extremely engaging and informative).  I purchased both DVDs from the Hidden Colors website (hiddencolorsfilm.com), so I paid a bit more than I would have here on Amazon, but EVERY penny is more than worth it.  As I start preparing to have a family of my own, this film was a must-have in my collection.  I'm going to start to have showings of these DVDs to my friends and family.  I salute Mr. Nasheed in putting together yet another masterpiece.  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!",1357603200,3,1361,4.831896551724138
5448860,5,B00AL6P4A4,I have heard many postive things about it. The Hidden Colors 1 movie was phenomenal! Thanks for bringing us fact based truths.,1357516800,2,126,4.7727272727272725
5448861,5,B00AL6P4A4,"This dvd goes even more in depth than the 1st hidden colors, but you got to get the 1st hidden colors in order to overstand the 2nd one, this documentary talks about the prison industrial complex & how it targets only the black & the brown, the drug problem plaguing all americans but how the media only focuses on people of color, the misperception of Africa, talking about how the media mainly show you bush people & war torn areas, when there's more beautiful industrial parts of Africa aswell as plenty crime free African countries ,it talks about how the imposter mix breed muslim occupiers of current Egypt  try to hide the true black presence of Egypt by changing the paintings from black to tan, it talks about how Ghandi really felt about black people & so much more, if your a person of any color, you would do yourself a great favor by purchasing a dvd that finally speaks the truth about black history.",1357430400,,914,4.539393939393939
5448862,5,B00AL6P4A4,Hidden Colors I was truly a long overdue Righting of the Wrong History of Africa benign taught in the schools. Hidden Colors II is further evidence that the mind is a terrible thing to waste and African Americans in America better wise up and step into the inheritance of its linage and teach the right history to future generations.,1357344000,8,333,4.661016949152542
5448863,5,B00AL6P4A4,This is a great follow-up to the original Hidden colors DVD and I just love everyone that play a part in the dvd. I will show this to my kids and family that want to learn something other than what is taught in the public school and so call religious systems...,1357257600,8,261,4.137254901960785
5448864,5,B00AL6P4A4,It is worth of getting 1 and 2 of the hidden color movie If you have children it's good for them to see their history just not about slavery.,1357257600,,141,3.896551724137931
5448865,5,B00AL6P4A4,The truth which isn't taught in schools. What better way to explain the history of a people than for the people of the history to teach it to their own people. Loved it. Others will too. Wake up to the truth my brothers and sisters.,1357171200,2,232,4.177777777777778
5448866,5,B00AL6P4A4,"The Hidden Colors series sparks conversation and turns on the light about African people as a whole. Most of the stuff mentioned in part one or two i never knew about and got my wheels turning into finding the truth about my people. Claud Anderson delivered a very powerful message in this dvd, that explained and gave us blacks a starting point to change and get out of the pit we are in as a race. You'll have to watch Hidden Colors 2 multiple times to catch everything that's in it. And it should be mandatory watching for anybody of color.",1357084800,3,543,4.3861386138613865
5448867,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I liked the DVD because the information presented is unique to me. Most of the things discussed are eye opening
and new to me. This is my second purchase of this DVD. I gave the first one to a relative that I thought it would find it
useful and very informative. I decided that I would watch it again. I think I appreciate the information more this time.
I will probably benefit more if I watch it a few more times.",1356825600,,415,4.135802469135802
5448868,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I was a little nervous about purchasing this DVD because Tariq Nasheed has what I consider to be some very negative, blackwoman-bashing videos on youtube.  However, because I really enjoyed Hidden Colors #1 and was excited to learn more from the historians and professors on Hidden Colors #2 - I decided to purchase.  I am so glad that I did!  The amount of knowledge given in this documentary is amazing.  During the video, professionals in history, education and the arts share research that dispels stereotypes about black people and Africa.  The information is enhanced by photographs of ancient paintings, statues, documents and videos.  I consider myself knowledgeable and this documentary had so much info that I did not know that I found myself running to google to learn more!  This is something that every black and brown person should watch repeatedly. I am purchasing copies for family and friends.",1356652800,3,910,5.067114093959732
5448869,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I was given this DVD as a Christmas gift and have watched it at least 15 times.  It is that good!  I learned SO MUCH MORE about what has been hidden and/or lied about in history and in today's media in regards to Africa and black African people. I like that the information was presented by educators who have devoted their lives to research. I could really relate to Michelle Alexander's work as I have a friend (50 years old) who recently went to jail because he did not have the money to pay for a single traffic violation. I am so happy this information is now available and was put together in this entertaining DVD format. This is information that all non-white but especially Black people should definitely know.  The video quality, music, and ancient photographs were all top-notch as usual (I have Hidden Colors #1).  This dvd and the book ""Black Love is a Revolutionary Act"" have really blasted open my perceptions.  Highly, highly recommended.",1356566400,,954,4.688622754491018
5448870,5,B00AL6P4A4,"Hidden Colors 1 was great but Hidden Colors 2 is outstanding! Everything is upgraded in the 2nd edition of this series; the production, length, knowledge, and visuals are all just astonishing and superior to the first version . In this edition, you the viewer will be taken across the globe as the speakers describe African history throughout the globe. It concludes with issues pertaining to African Americans and offers solutions to those very problems.",1356480000,,455,5.162162162162162
5448871,5,B00AL6P4A4,"Seldom does the sequel measure up compared to the original, well this one certainly did.
What makes this video series so great is that the information it contains you will not see on television ever, cable or otherwise. A must have for everyone, not just African Americans but for everyone so we all may have a better understanding of the world in which live.",1356220800,,359,4.625
5448872,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I loved the first Hidden Colors and this second one ups the bar. For people who are into history and about learning where black people have come from and have gone, this is a must see. It's time that black people are aware that there's more to themselves besides being enslaved.",1355788800,2,278,4.470588235294118
5448873,5,B00AL6P4A4,It's about time! Let it be know that Black people have an immense global history and although WS try to hide that fact-what they do in the darkness WILL come to light!

5448874,5,B00AL6P4A4,My husband I went to see the one night only showing in Los Angeles. Both of these movies need to be part of all childrens history class.

5448875,5,B00AL6P4A4,This film is an excellent chronicle of the African presence in the world. I aplaude this film for telling a story that far too often gets glossed over. It provokes you to ask questions and not settle for what's being spoon fed in our schools and universities. Please share this information and encourage others to ask questions and challenge our educators to include a broader exploration in our schools. Ultimately it's up to you to share and research the information you receive here.,1355443200,9,486,4.867469879518072
5448876,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I saw the Hidden Colors 2 primary in the LA theater, and I was extremely impressed with the content that was presented in the documentary, and I left the theater stunned. Even my nephew was impressed with the documentary. It even did a thorough job of explaining religion. So if your a Black Christian,Black Muslim, Black Hebrew etc,you need to see this so that you can be sure to know that your worshipping the right color of God, and not nobody else's.",1355443200,11,454,4.548780487804878

5448878,5,B00AL6P4A4,"I've never in my life hear people speak and give away the information as they delivered in this film. Growing up as a child and adult I have always educated myself on the hidden black history. Finally, someone had the heart to release this information on the movie screen and let black people know whats really going on. If you ever wanted to learn history beyond what your teacher taught you in school I highly recommend you add Hidden Colors 1 & 2 into your collection of DVD's.

Share the information with everyone you know, like and care about because it can make a BIG difference in your life TODAY!

P.S. Everything they spoke about in Hidden Colors 2 is documented on paper if that makes a difference upon you purchasing.",1355184000,122,728,4.549618320610687
