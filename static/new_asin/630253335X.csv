This is one of those old movies with plenty of music, featuring some of the best  trios from yesteryear, most notably Los Panchos and Trio Calavera. They accompany the Mexican singing and matinee idol  Pedro Infante for some very beautiful music. The plot line is simple and evolves around one bad guy who happens to be rich, a hilarious woman who is also rich  and  Pedro Infante as Ramiro and Sofia Alvarez as Lupita in the lead roles. There is also a good comic performance by  ""El Chicote"" who plays the funny sidekick to Pedro Infante's Ramiro. Lupita was captured as a child and her father is seriously injured  but thought by Lupita to be dead when he tries to resue his daughter . By the time of the attempted rescue form the rich landowner Lupita is a grown up  pretty woman who sings. Of course the rich man has evil intententions and plans to wed his beautiful prize Lupita. Enter Ramiro who falls instantly in love with a reluctant and resistant Lupita. Meanwhile the rich woman has her eyes on Ramiro, in other words everyone is loving the wrong person. The rich woman is an enemy of Lupita who is poor and makes her grand entrances into scenes in her fancy car while everyone else is on horseback. She is very funny in her dialogue as she constantly throws in some English (Oh darling, etc,) terms to snub her adversary Lupita. There are some singing ""battles"" between Lupita and Ramiro that are excellent I can do anything better than you can do performances. Most of the action takes place around the hacienda, everyone is dressed in charro oufits(Mexcian cowboy) with pistols on their waists ready to settle any arguements around the table where the tequila is flowing. There are contant mini battles going on to win the hearts of the person who loves another. In the end everyone ends up with the right person  and Lupita sees her father who she thought was dead. The movie is a little corny in parts but the music is terrific and there is so much humor in the movie that it is highly entertaining. Recommended for old time movie buffs.",1058918400,2,2183,4.536895674300254
