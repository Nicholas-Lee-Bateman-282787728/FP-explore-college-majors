6780586,5,B00P02O1QW,If you love Dean Ambrose like I do... get this box set! It was so great to get a chance to see some of his Indie days (as Jon Moxley) and to see the growth he's gone through over the years as well as the passion he's seemingly had for what he does since the beginning. This is a great collection! But fair warning... lots and lots of blood and is not for the squeamish.,1432944000,3,369,3.933333333333333
