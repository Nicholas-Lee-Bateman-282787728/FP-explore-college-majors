8519124,5,B007KNBX38,"Overall, the material Sifu Tandez covers in this DVD is well organized and easy to follow. From one chapter to the next, you will see slow motion and full speed video demonstrations of the techniques from both front and side view, hear thorough explanations of the techniques presented, and when necessary, on-screen annotations help the viewer understand the material covered in full detail -- if you are slow in taking notes, just pause the video and take notes from the annotated screenshot; you do not have to be a dictation expert, trying to takes notes from just audio alone, while trying to absorb and learn the techniques visually (definitely not the case in this DVD).

The angles selected in filming the material of the DVD is professionally done, giving the viewer the perspective of being in a private lesson with Sifu Tandez and his assistant instructors (Simo Tandez, Michael and Myles).  As a regular student in Sifu Tandez's classes, I can definitely say that if you were in class and standing in the wrong place among a large group of students, you will not see the finer details when Sifu Tandez demonstrates the techniques (definitely not the case in this DVD).  If you happen to miss the finer details, it's a DVD, which you can pause, rewind and run in slow motion.

As for the material covered on the DVD, you find all of the material that is covered in Beginner Level, Level 1 of Sifu Tandez's regular classes, which includes: stances, footwork, boxing techniques, philosophies like economy of motion, power side forward, etc., kicking techniques, Jun Fan Gung Fu parries, simple traps, and wooden dummy drills.

If you are new to JKD or have been learning JKD for a while, this DVD will definitely be a good tool to have.",1340582400,3,1745,4.78405315614618
8519125,5,B007KNBX38,"Great for beginners and for anyone who wants to fine tune their basic fundamentals in JKD!  Sifu Adrian, certified under Guro Dan Inosanto and Sifu Paul Vunak, explains every concept in depth, demonstrates each technique(from basic boxing techniques to footwork and simple trapping) breaking them down in detail, and re-emphazing the key points of technique or concept.  This DVD contains your basic stances, punching/kicking techniques, footwork, even some wooden dummy drills, and much more.  It even shows the type of conditioning a beginner can perform while at this level, and again it is explained in detail.  Clear, concise, and organized in a fashion where even someone whose never done JKD or any martial arts for that matter can truly understand. Again I truly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to learn what JKD is all about; martial arts at its finest!",1339718400,2,870,5.105633802816901
8519126,5,B007KNBX38,"I've been doing martial arts for a while and have recently started taking JKD and FMA/Kali lessons from Sifu Tandez. During class Sifu Tandez blends theory and practice in a way that makes learning fun yet practical. He really wants you to understand why you are doing what you are doing (contrary to other instructors I've seen where you keep wondering why things are done a certain way). I was skeptical at first whether his teaching style would translate well into DVD format and was pleasantly surprised!

No matter if you have practiced JKD for a while, is just beginning to learn, or simply wants to check out what JKD is all about, this DVD won't disappoint. It covers the basics (stance, punches, kicks, moving, avoiding being hit, etc.) and each action is given to you in three different ways:

1. The theory behind the action
2. The action, fast paced as you will see it in reality
3. Slow motion with on-screen annotations that explain it in detail

This is the kind of DVD that is best watched first with a pen and paper in hand as you take copious notes about the theory behind each movement, and then as you practice to check what else you need to do in order to improve.

Looking forward to the second volume and to the Kali series!",1339027200,3,1247,4.504424778761062
8519127,5,B007KNBX38,"I have the honor of training at Sifu Adrian's dojo, and this video has been a great addition to my training.  I'm currently preparing to take my first level test, and this disc breaks down everything you need to know clearly and at a pace that's easy to follow.  Can't wait for Sifu to produce more discs for the upper levels and other Arts he teaches as well.",1338854400,,360,4.279411764705882
