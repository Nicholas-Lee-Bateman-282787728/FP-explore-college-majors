596710,5,6303212395,"The decade of the 80's produced some classic, great films. But none captures the dreamy fantasyworld of that time better than The Neverending Story. Disregard the other sequels, this is the only good one. It is  magical, wondrous, and enveloping. I am truly in love with this film.  Everyone should experience its magic.",915926400,,320,5.018867924528302
596711,2,6303212395,"The theme of reconciliation with dad that occurs in the Neverending Story might be great for all those kids out there with great dads, but for my kids whose dad doesn't reconcile/apologize for anything, I think the movie  teaches kids they have to be heroes themselves and maybe then dad will come  and everything will be alright. Do you know how hard kids try to make this  happen? Let this be a cue to dad's out there to watch the movie and, if  there's ever been a time when your relationship with your kid wasn't great,  to go to your kid and apologize and get some professional help for both of  you to really work it out.",915840000,2,627,4.316239316239316
596712,5,6303212395,"When I first saw this movie at 11 years, words could not describe the emotions I felt.  The Neverending Story has been my favorite ever since, even at 25.  It is magical. I still get goosebumps every time I see the  movie.  The soundtrack is wonderful, such beautifull music. You can almost  imagine yourself there with Bastian and Atreju.  I am an adult and proud to  say that this movie inspires me and it always will!  I love to read,  especially fantasy novels.  If you like to leave it all behind and go some  place wonderful just follow Bastian as he reads his story.  Bastian is a  young boy having a hard time dealing with the death of his mother and also  a father who insists he grow up much to fast.  He reads The Neverending  Story, which is about a boy warrior, Atreju.  Atreju is on a quest to find  a way to stop the Nothing, a horrible thing which is eating up Fantasia.  The warrior must travel thousands of miles and meet many enchanting friends  along the way.  As Atreju goes on this quest Bastian discovers that he is  living vicariously through Atreju and that this story, this quest is all  meant to reach him.  Bastian realizes he is a very important part and that  he alone can save Fantasia. He learns that his dreams and imagination are  all part of life and are a necessity. Without our imagination we are all in  a sad existence and easily controlled because we have no drive, no  inspiration.  Watch it, keep and open mind and heart and you will see that  you are also a part of The Neverending Story.",915408000,15,1531,4.364285714285714
596820,5,6303212395,My 7 year old son loved this movie.  He especially loved the special effects (even thought they are over 30 yrs old!).  Big laughs at the end when Bastian chases the bullies and they run away like maniacs.  Still a classic.  Enjoy.,1521590400,,231,4.428571428571429
596821,5,6303212395,"One of my ALL time favorite movies! There's a bit of the Irish mythologies in it, which is a plus. I wonder is this move one of Jim Henson's great movies of the 1980s? (Jim Henson Company of Muppets fame)? You can't expect to see computer generated effects when no one but NASA even had computers back then, and they used punch cards to run programs in batches. But that doesn't matter, because the story itself holds up so well. A fantastic, well done story always trumps effects anyway, and it's great to see a movie where story is the most important and does not suffer because of effects. It's a generous, moving film.",1521244800,,622,4.464912280701754
596822,1,6303212395,"Only buy this movie if you REALLY loved it in 1984. A friend told me it was a great story. I barely managed to watch the horrible, fake, scenes and special affects of the 1980s. The kid screaming like a quacker, he needs some therapy. Both kids do. I am not sure the point of the story made any sense. Good grief, there's 2 hours of my life I can't get back!",1520208000,,358,3.986111111111111

596825,5,6303212395,"Well it was time for my kids to see what their dad watched when he was a kid. This is a movie that surpasses the test of time. I really don't like to give full details of the movie/s, actors, and, plot etc. I will though let you know that the visuals on Blu ray looked so good I just don't know how they managed to clean up this 30 year old movie. If you have seen this movie when you were a child and want to spend some time with your kids being entertained or amazed by the characters in the movie I recommend you purchase this one.",1518307200,2,534,3.908256880733945

596881,5,6303212395,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Seeing this movie at age 9 had a major impact on the course of my life.  I paid extra at the local tax collector's office to have a personalized license plate on my car that is a reference to The Neverending Story. For me, It was that good of a movie. Obviously not everyone will love it as much as I do, but if you enjoy movies such as Willy Wanka, The Goonies, and The Princess Bride than is is right up your alley. To me, the Neverending Story is the pinnacle of live action kid's movies that adults will also enjoy . Watch it with your kids - you will be glad you did!",1516492800,,604,3.9917355371900825

597101,5,6303212395,"Must see for kids. Adults should think about the message.

597103,5,6303212395,"Great memories of this fantasy movie from my 1980's childhood.

So I've grown up, and decided to buy this for my own children, as part of an initiative to expand their exposure of live-action animatronic movies from Jim Henson. These days everything is animated with computers, and it's just not the same. Anyways....  my family loved it, and it's become one of my daughter's most favorite movies right now. I had a good bit of nostalgia that was great. Will probably be watching this over and over again, because that is how children are with movies they like. The movie does have some mildly spooky parts, nothing that would IMHO cause nightmares, but your miles may vary depending on the child and age. Finally, the theme music for this movie was great, and the entire musical score was 1980's new-wave synth pop! Actually we started playing the theme music via internet streaming audio because the kids just like it that much..",1501286400,3,931,4.77639751552795

My 5 year old goes around singing the Never Ending Song and my 7 year old grandson also liked it. I will be getting the second movie for them.",1501286400,2,431,4.204819277108434

***Spoiler Alert***

Bastian, a shy and friendless child, is on his way to school when some bullies pick on him. In an attempt to escape their torture, Bastian hides in a bookshop. The owner, Mr. Coreandor, is grumpy. He stumbles upon a book and Mr. Coreander warns him against reading the book. Bastian is intrigued so he grabs the book and leaves a little note promising to return the book. Bastian goes into the school attic and starts reading.

In the book, he discovers a place called Fantasia. He is quickly drawn into their world. He learns of ""The Nothing"" and the fact that it is slowly killing Fantasia. The Ruler, a child-like Empress, is sick and an Indian boy, Atreyu is tasked with finding the cure. The people of Fantasia believe that once the Empress is cured, ""The Nothing"" will be demolished. Atreyu is given the Orin as a protection. I cried when his horse, Artax was claimed by the swamp :(

This is a brilliant movie with such originality. I loved the Luckdragon, Falkor, Mora the Turle Mountain,  and all the other characters. To me as a child, it was funny, scary and sometimes nail-biting. Bastian plays such a big role in the book as well.

598375,1,6303212395,"This book-to-movie is one of the worst ever--the acting is terrible, the screenplay is a mishmash of moments from a truly magical meta-book (that is a meditation about the miraculous act of reading as much as it is an imaginative adventure for kids), and the SFX are laughable. But it's a product of its times, you say. Perhaps, perhaps, but the overall quality of movies and TV shows being made for kids today is so astronomically better than it was back in 1984 that my kids (who are as eager for the new and as any consumer fattened in the West during the Age of Information) knew right away that this was just an awful piece of crap. And there were plenty of other kids' movies from that era that respected their audiences and trafficked in similar material: THE PRINCESS BRIDE, for instance, which is as good now as it ever was. I wish that I could go back and unwatch it twice: the first time I saw it, when I was a kid, and the second time, when in a fit of nostalgia (and a spasm of failing memory) I watched it again with my own kids. Avoid at all costs.",1473033600,,1063,4.267326732673268

Being the new kid in school was not easy and being able to escape in a story helped. This is also what imagine when when my 6 years old son reads his books and acts them out. The plot is great and opens the imagination. A true classic. There are so many wonderful characters that were created for the film. I was up on my seat when I first watched when he had to go through the two sphinxes. The rock biter is big lovable characters that grows on you throughout the story. I have watched the movie over 100 times throughout my life, and I must say this is my favorite movie still at age 38. It brings back so much memories of my childhood.

Somehow I missed it for the next 30 years but decided to watch it tonight with my wife.  Every 10 minutes or so during the movie we would wonder aloud when they were going to introduce what the point of the movie was.

I still don't know.  Someone enlighten me.  I kind of though the movie would end with his experiences somehow leading to the kid making sense of his mother's death or helping his father learn how to relate to him better or...something.  The only story line that somewhat reconciled is when the kid magically (but with no explanation as to how) appears in the real world riding his good luck puppy dragon thing to scare the bullies.",1453420800,,799,4.28

The voice-over of the princess can cause nightmares if one listens too closely. The flying, fury luck dragon resembles [MATURE CONTENT] that it becomes absurd. Plus, it's stupid.

In fact, he went straight from ""Das Boot"" to ""The Neverending Story."" But make no mistake: this one is a kids' movie.

I loved it as a kid. I wanted to ride on the back of a Luck Dragon and have that dragon make all of my bully problems jump into dumpsters. I wanted to become a part of the books that I read. I wanted to ride with Atreyu and help him defeat the Gmork and the Nothing. I loved this movie.

And my kids loved it when we just watched it.

But this is a kids' movie.

Adults can still enjoy it, but there are parts that are very, very slow, and some of the acting is laughable. In fact, whenever the Luck Dragon would talk, I couldn't help but laugh at it. It really is a silly kids' movie. And kids don't really care about things like dialogue and acting. As an adult, parts of it didn't really work for me.",1449446400,6,993,4.051020408163265

601765,5,6303212395,"Saw this twice back when it was first released. Love the characters, storyline and Wolfgang Peterson's direction (The DAS BOOT Director's English Language debut). Noah Hathaway (Boxey, Battlestar Galactica), as Atreyu, is believable. Baret Oliver (COCOON) is also good. The music by Klaus Doldinger and Gorgio Moroder (With a cool title song by Lihmal), like the movie, is timeless. In fact, I still get 80's flashbacks everytime I see this film (and listening to the soundtrack).",1449014400,,480,5.328947368421052

601826,5,6303212395,"Just a wonderful story with so many messages.  One of the lessons I got from it this time, that I didn't catch so many years ago when I watched it with my younger brother and sister was that darkness can have the answers you seek.

This is pure imagination and is important for the current generation of children to understand the value of books and their imaginations.  A book takes a little effort, but it is a format that should never loose face and it's importance in growing a child's skills of language and imagination. Stories and storytelling is the longest surviving art form. From the time of Homer with oral tradition and before, Andrew.",1448323200,,495,4.892857142857143

As a child of the late 70's and Early 80's, this film is inscribed indelibly on my psyche as a formative work. Fans of Labrynth, Dark Crystal, etc. will love it.

The special effects were top of the line when it came out, but will look very dated to someone that isn't used to 80s genre movies.

606792,4,6303212395,"Although we all know that the production value of this film pales in comparison to modern movies, it's still a hit with my kids.  They enjoy it as much as I did, and they have asked for it multiple times.  I have a five year old boy and a six year old girl, and there's a boy hero and a girl empress - plus, the actors are close enough to their ages that it really hits home.  How does it get better?  Yes, there are a couple of hard spots when a character gets taken by the nothing (the horse is particularly hard), but remember - spoiler - that everything works out in the end.  Bonus for kids is that you can pause it so that you can explain that they don't have to worry because they do win in the end and all of the things that went wrong will be put right.  Exciting and nothing tacky or abrasive.  Plus, good triumphs over evil and it gives kids a sense of control that they can make a difference.",1436832000,6,904,4.016759776536313

606849,4,6303212395,"Movie is timeless, plotline does not need revisiting. I'm only here to comment that you should force plain old stereo when watching this movie, as the 5.1 upscaling that was done by my receiver made it unbearable, which is not the usual experience for me. After my kid insisted we watch it again, the next day, a second time in a row, we watched it on the smaller TV which has no surround sound and it was 10 times more pleasant to watch, no dynamic volume problems.

I found with the surround sound I was constantly turning down the thunderstorm sounds and then turning up the speech. I never have to do that for movies new or old, but this one was particularly bad for that.",1436745600,3,676,4.365079365079365

There is something odd about this movie. Perhaps it's the special effects. Perhaps it's just that I'm used to big-budget fantasies as they're made in the USA. But I did enjoy it.

609356,2,6303212395,"This movie has unfortunately lost its magic now 30 years out. The puppets and graphics are painful to watch. The characters are overacted and the protagonist only has two types of speech: talking and yelling. The world is arguably imaginative but the storyline is overly linear and oftentimes wrapped up in vague, confusing explanations. I also question the messages that are delivered namely: dealing with loss and difficulty by getting literally lost in a book while in a school attic without telling anyone where you are. Instead of learning to deal with life's problems the character instead runs away from them and becomes even further removed from society.",1431907200,,662,5.138888888888889

We still don't know what name he called out. :). It was funny because when he did, both my grandsons turned around, looked at me and said, ""Whaaattttt?"". I only shrugged my shoulders.

First, this movie has one of the saddest moments I have ever seen in all of cinema in the first act, something that an eight-year-old almost should not see.  Second, Tami Stronach was the first time I ever realized a girl could be pretty.

610952,3,6303212395,"I love this movie. It's unique. It's very creative. And it's actually got a powerful message about the importance of imagination and storytelling.

Plus it's like SUPER 1980's and you can't go wrong with that.

The problem for me was with the quality of the presentation on the Amazon download viewed through the FireStick. The image was super dark. In some of the scenes in the woods where the rock monster talks to the snail and that group, you could barely make out the characters on the screen. (Toshiba HD screen with decent black levels). This isn't Amazon's fault as they are just hosting the digital file given to them by the movie studio, but the print really needs to be brightened a bit to bring it back to it's original 1980's big screen glory. Even the VHS I had of this 20 years ago has more color depth.

This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

THE NEVERENDING STORY: Eight-year-old Bastian (Oliver) is taking the death of his mother very hard. He spends his days daydreaming, frightened by life and terrorized by bullies. One day they chase him into an antique bookstore, where he discovers and borrows a rare storybook entitled The NeverEnding Story. Hiding in his schools attic, he begins reading, fascinated by the incredible characters that populate the magical land of Fantasia, and by the adventures of young warrior Atreyu (Hathaway), sent on a quest to save Fantasia from The Nothing, a mysterious plague which swallows reality and leaves only emptiness in its wake.

Bastian finds himself irresistibly drawn into Atreyus adventures, their fates mystically intertwined. And when the Empress (Stronach) appeals directly to Bastian from the pages of the enchanted manual, can he find the courage to believewhich is the only way to save Fantasia?

Discussion: Poet T.S. Eliot called it the objective correlative: a metaphor so perfect and powerful that it freights with it an exact emotional experience. For Bastian, the storybook in The NeverEnding Story is the objective correlativeand for the viewer, the movie serves the same purpose, as we are eerilyand properlyincorporated into the action.

The best fairy tales contain mystery, a moral message (here, facing your fears), a touch of darkness, and pure primal emotionsfear, despair, courage, joyand allow us to participate in the catharsis they provide. What a rare film it is that offers all this, if only one is willing to be absorbed in the story! The NeverEnding Story is both modern mythology and a loving tribute to innocence and the infinite power of the imagination. Its a film not just for children, but for the unrepentant dreamer in us all.",1423180800,,2030,5.050746268656717

612902,4,6303212395,"I watched this again after well over 20 years. I watched it for the first time with my seven year old. He loved it (but was afraid of the wolf.) Two things stood out: 1) The story is a bit ""complicated"" (or maybe abstract) for ""youngsters""--but it did give us the ""open opportunity"" to pause and explain imagination and how ""it's up to you to create 'things' in this world""), 2) The visual effects and visuals are still stunning. (I've been a visual effects expert in Hollywood for 20+ years.) If it weren't for the mouthes on the creatures not ""keeping up with"" or perfectly syncing with spoken dialogue (puppetry was used), one would be hard-pressed to believe this movie was not done in the ""modern era"" of special effects. ""Now-a-days"" everything and anything is accomplished with computer graphics, but this masterpiece preceded ""all of that."" It's a testament to the art, craft, and ""manual"" talent of the makers of this film. Wow. 'like staring at the Golden Gate Bridge or realizing the Apollo missions got to the moon way, way before modern computer technology was even prophesied. From make-up, to costumes, to matte paintings and dye-tank cloud effects, it leaves me in awe, and almost longing for the ""good old days"" where artists ""rolled up their sleeves"" and physically made wonderful, beautiful, and awe-filled things! So many scenes are simply breath-taking. (Ignoring a few black [matte] outlines, it's flawless!) Bravo!",1420588800,,1437,4.966804979253112

""The Neverending Story"" was always touted as a classic in my youth; people talked about it with a touch of reverence, but I never got around to watching it.  I finally took a look, and found that about halfway through I was bored; reading reviews, that is not an uncommon reaction.  Maybe it's one of those films that little kids adore, and if you try to re-watch it later the illusion is shattered.  Kind of like seeing current photos of actresses/actors you crushed on as a kid, and realizing how old and unattractive they've gotten...and realizing you're in the same boat.",1419897600,,605,4.626168224299065

613784,3,6303212395,"2.5 stars. Although it's nice to see a kids' fantasy movie from the age when it was all still done with puppets, sets and costumes instead of gajillion dollars' worth of CGI, this isn't great. Even for a kids' movie the writing is clunky and prosaic, the acting gets pretty awful, and the pace is slow enough to send most any kid to the land of nod, especially in today's whizbang kids' world. I get why folks who saw it as kids back in the day might be nostalgically fond of it, and it has its moments, but generally it's meh. If for some reason you're looking for 80s fantasy films for kids, there are better ones",1419292800,,615,4.264957264957265

Atreyu: But why is Fantasia dying, then?
G'mork: Because people have begun to lose their hopes and forget their dreams. So the Nothing grows stronger.
Atreyu: What is the Nothing?
G'mork: It's the emptiness that's left. It's like a despair, destroying this world. And I have been trying to help it.
Atreyu: But why?
G'mork: Because people who have no hopes are easy to control; and whoever has the control... has the power!",1418515200,,603,4.688679245283019

As for the content of the movie, I probably would have loved it if I had seen it as a child like I should have, but seeing it as an adult left a lot to be desired.  The special effects are so bad, it's comical.  The story also has enough plotholes big enough to drive a freight train through.  I know I might get a lot of flack for those opinions because ""it's a classic"", but that's how I feel.  Not a terrible way to spend an hour-ish, but not a fantastic one either.  I'm sure it would be good to show to your children if you're busy corrupting them with the other 80s and 90s hits you grew up with!

I love that it glamorizes reading -- ""become the story"" -- and so that by itself would be a critical point to drive home to these kids with faces glued to electronic devices.

I'm really surprised a remake hasn't come out yet.  For the adults, it's just as riveting as you remember, for children, it's a great story just a little behind on graphics.

Crossing the chasm of fear emoted by well-endowed/squinting-phoenix-statues tops off a strange 1980s journey into what was a dying industry.  20+ years later this is still an awesome example that the magic never died.

615282,5,6303212395,"The old 2010 blu-ray of this classic Timeless film was insulting had no special features at all
and the blu-ray transfer was s***
for some fans that don't know this film was 60% German made, German filmed
and about 40% American/British made
the film is based on German author Michael ende book of the same name of the film

there's 2 blu-ray versions, the WB 30th Aniversary edition & the 2012 German blu-ray version
first the 30th Anniversary edition
this time Warner bros have given fans brand new special features
1st Featurette RE-IMAGINING THE NEVERENDING STORY
which is 25min new recollections from the German Production team from the film
Wolfgang peterson, Producer Dieter Geissler, Screenplay writer Herman Weigal
Cinematographer Jost Vacano & Music Composer Klaus Doldinger
plus interviews with American executives Mark Damon & John Hyde.
the German crew speak English for this new featurette, no subtitles
only 2 Actors from the film have been newly interviewed Tami stronach & Gerald McRaney who played Bastian's father
Barret oliver & Noah hathaway who played Atreyu are not interviewed for some reason
maybe they were asked but Declined
this new featurette should've gone for maybe 40mins i think, but still very interesting to watch

2nd new featurette is RESTORATION
which is 10min interview with the person who did the blu-ray restoration for the film
the interview is German with English subtitles obviously, no surprise there
i couldn't see the point watching it, but it's here on the blu-ray

plus a new Audio commentary by Wolfgang peterson, very interesting commentary to
he gives more recollections on the film

there's also 2 Documentaries on this blu-ray
1st Doco is a 20mins featurette
MAKING OF THE NEVERENDING STORY
filmed in 2004 for the 2 Disc dvd German release only
in German language with English subtitles again

the 2nd Doco  A WORLD OF FANTASIES
which has previously been watched on youtube.com as bootleg footage is now officially released on this blu-ray
55mins Behind the scenes on set footage in Germany 1983-1984 of the making of the film
very interesting behind the scenes footage if you can tolerate the English subtitles

there's also the 2012 German blu-ray release by Constantine film
which is the Extended version of The Neverending story run time 101mins
which i bought from amazon.de just to watch for curiosity reasons
this German version has roughly 4-5mins of extra scenes & Dialogue in the film
the extra scenes are not new scenes but are extra Dialogue & footage from the original scenes
in the U.S. version that's all
most noticeably is the end scene with Child empress crying out to Sebastian
this has been extended for an extra minute with footage of the Ivory tower crumbling

so both German & U.S. versions are very similar to each other
you can easily select English language 5.1 surround sound option in setup
so there are no English subtitles
but some of the Characters have been Dubbed in American English thou
for eg Indian Actor Deep roy who played Teeny weeny with his Racing snail has been Dubbed
by a very thick Texan Actor which does sound bizarre
Actor Tilo pruckner who plays Nighthob has been Dubbed aswell
Alan Oppenheimer who did the voice over work for the Gmork in the U.S. version
has a completely different voice, someone else did the Gmork voice in the German version
apart from that Falkor and the other Actors Patricia Hayes & sydney bromley voices are exact the same
Childlike empress & Atreyu voice's have not been Dubbed it's the same voice as the U.S. version.
the blu-ray transfer for the German release is exactly the same as the U.S. blu-ray
nice sharp & clear picture quality in 2:35:1 widescreen
the extras on the German blu-ray are 2004 retrospective German TV broadcast in German language
with English subtitles

the new special features is 30 years in the making & finally on blu-ray
this film has finally been given the respect it Deserves
personally i like both versions so i'm Happy i bought the German blu-ray aswell
i gave this 30th Anniversary & the German blu-ray 5 stars for sure, worth the cash for sure
you can easily buy the German blu-ray of amazon.de and get it shipped to the U.S.",1415836800,21,4187,4.885915492957746

616217,2,6303212395,"The Neverending Story is an 80s fantasy classic that holds a special place in my heart due to the fact that I grew up loving the movie (as I'm sure is the case for many others). Now that I'm an adult, I have an even greater appreciation for all of the technical wizardry that went into the making of the film, and I've only grown to love it even more. Needless to say, I was really looking forward to this Anniversary Edition because of the announcement that it had been remastered. As such, you can imagine my disappointment when I bought the disc only to find that, in actuality, it contains the same transfer as the 2010 blu-ray which I already sold in anticipation of this new one. To add insult to injury, there's even a featurette about the restoration on the blu-ray - a restoration that clearly wasn't used for this release. How this could have happened is beyond me, but I am an extremely disappointed fan, and I can't help but feel that I was duped into buying this Anniversary Edition due to false advertising.

To be fair, the new special features are extremely welcome, and the movie is wonderful in any shape or form, but seeing as Wolfgang Petersen himself has taken issue with the color timing of the current transfer, the movie is clearly in need of a remaster. Regardless of how the movie looks, the bottom line is we were promised a remaster, and we didn't get one. I'm giving this release two stars for the special features and because the movie itself is great, but that's being generous because WB really dropped the ball on this one. If they give us a proper remastered disc and offer an exchange program, I'll happily edit my review to reflect the fact that they've made amends. Until then, I'll be thinking twice about my future WB purchases.",1412726400,13,1767,4.521875

616219,1,6303212395,"""Each film restored"" written in ads and ""Restoration"" written on back of Blu-ray cover is intentional false advertising.

How could it be a quality control mistake if the ads and cover have such little information to begin with?",1412726400,11,228,5.0
616220,1,6303212395,"This review is based on The Neverending Story 30th Anniversary blu ray.  This is not a review of the movie (the movie earns a 4.5/5 from me).

Neverending Story was previously released on blu ray back in 2010 as a bare bones edition with marginal picture quality, much was left for improvement.

Warner Brothers decided to re-release Neverending Story as a 30th Anniversary edition in 2014 and marketed the film as having a new remaster.  This has ended up being a complete falsity, it's the exact same transfer as the edition put out in 2010 without any upgrade in video or audio quality.  Their promotion department are now back-peddling on all the advertisements they've been putting out since June of 2014.

The only difference between this release and the previous is the addition of a few extra features.  One of the extra features is an in-depth documentary about the remastering process used on the film except this special feature doesn't even apply to this edition!  It's about the European release which did have a remaster done; this only adds salt to the wound for fans of the film hoping for the best quality available in the United States.

Warner Brothers really messed up with this release.  My advice, buy the cheaper version without the few measly extra features and save $7-10, here is the link to that release: http://www.amazon.com/Neverending-Story-Blu-ray-Noah-Hathaway/dp/B002Z7FM68/ref=tmm_blu_title_1?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=",1412726400,10,1451,5.296943231441048

If you have the first release, save your money, heck, maybe pick up a copy of the German Extended version, from Amazon.de, it contains the Limahl theme song, as well as a better looking version of this classic movie.",1412726400,12,535,4.404040404040404

I've watched it so many times I've lost count.  It never stops being a great movie.

The movie starts out well, but ends with a childish rampage in which the hero--riding on the back of his pet dragon--takes childish revenge against his childhood tormenters. This ending is completely unrelated to the book, which has far more powerful and important points to make.

Upon seeing what was done to his story without his knowledge, Michael Ende the usually reserved and thoughtful author held an impassioned press conference to denounce ""that revolting movie"" and demanded that his name be removed from the credits. It was.

""The makers of the film simply did not understand the book at all,"" he complained. ""They just wanted to make money.""

I highly recommend reading the book first. Better yet, only read the book and skip the movie. which only serves to insult a great author, a beautiful story, and its viewers--while the perpetrators smile to the bank.",1409443200,3,969,4.932515337423313

For people more accustomed to Middle Earth it'll seem simplistic and predictable, which it is, but it is still a good view. For me a funny part was the hero, a boy named Atreyu, attempting to get vital information from a giant turtle which happens to be allergic to human children. The kid climbs a tree to get his info and is promptly sneezed down into the mud. You had to be there.

Well worth the money, especially for those of us who first saw it in the movies.

It has Henson'esque style creatures and can be frightening in much the same way a movie like ""Labyrinth"" can be. Other than that, it is just a great story about the power of imagination and why books are still relevant in a more modern age. I loved this as a child, and I still do. One particular scene, that may or may not involve a swamp, was the first movie scene I ever witnessed that made me weep in abject grief. It was a good learning experience though.

I have just purchased the book from Amazon, and I am looking forward to reading it since hearing reviews about it on line.

Everything looks fake now due to the jump in technology from when this came out, but its really such a great movie.

Its like a movie about a book!  <<<Thats a joke.

Bastion  (Barrett  Oliver)  loves  reading,  but  could  care  less  about  studying,  &  avoids  a  math  test.  I  wasn't  any  good  with  math  myself  &  I  hated  it.  The  guy  at  the  Book  store,  says  he  doesn't  like  Kids,  but  soon  softens  up  to  Bastion  after  he  tells  the  man  about  him  being  chased  by  bullies.  First  suggestion,  tell  the  school  principal  so  they  can  be  dealt  with.
Anyways  he  must  have  been  exaggerating  when  he  said  no,  You  can't  take  the  book.  That's  how  adults  are,
Bastion  did  take  an  interest  in  the  book.  Its  got  an  Orin  symbol  on  the  cover,  the  kind  of  book  that  makes  your  imagination  come  alive.
The  star  of  the  story  is  about  a  young  boy  named  Atreu  (Noah Hathaway)
who  goes  on  a  quest  to  find  a  cure  for  the  impress,  if  a  cure  for  the  impress  is  found  the  Nothing  will  stop  destroying  the  land.  The  adventures  exciting,
as  him  &  Artex  his  horse  begin  their  journey.  But  an  enemy  werewolf  creature  that  Atreu  wasn't  warned  about  is  out  to  stop  Atreu.  He  must  overcome  tremendous  odds,  seek  advice  or  suggestions.  &  he  &  Falcor  fly  at  zooming  speeds  trying  to  get  ahead  of  the  nothing  before  it  takes  fantasia  out  of  existence.  Bastion  eventually  comes  forth  to  save  fantasia  &  meets  the  child  like  impress  (Tami Stronach).  Makes  his  first  wish  then  takes  his  own  ride  on  Falcor.  I  enjoyed  every  moment  of  the  movie.  No  question  about  it.
I've  seen  part  2.  Its  not  even  half  as  good.  &  if  they  say  part  3  isn't  any  good,  I'll  take  their  word  for  it!",1404691200,,1814,4.358885017421603

620472,5,6303212395,"I remember watching this film adaption as a youth. From my childhood I remember vague scenes of a great white dragon,a  scary rock Neanderthal, a beautiful white horse, and a cute but brave Native American boy.

I recently watched this as an adult and finally realized the true theme and meaning of the story.

We find our hero, Bastian, suffering from melancholy after the passing of his mother. His authoritative father tells him to basically man up, which I find a tad bit rude for a 9 year old, but hey, I'm not a parent, so what do I know? Anywho, after witnessing some authentic 80s bullying, Bastian winds up in an old book store where he uses his five finger discount to obtain a book that is not for him by a crazy old dude.

Upon his arrival to school, he decides early on that math is clearly not an important subject (hellooo calculators, T-83s!!!) And why take a quiz when you know where the spare key to the attic of your school is?

Bastian is able to find some extremely flammable candles in the extremely wooden attic with the magical matches they leave around in 80s elementary schools (that's a lawsuit waiting to happen). He becomes encompassed into the world of Fantasia, which is quickly vanishing away by ""The Nothing."" The young Native American takes on the challenge of a quest to save his world. [SPOIL ALERT]: You see some pre PETA scenes early on with Artex the beautiful white pony. Atreyu (the native) forges through a tough and brutal quest including passing extremely large chested sphinxes, while hearing the dismay and defeated woes of Fantasia's people. Real Debbie downer types.

Eventually, Atreyu meets a creepy animatronic white dragon who admits he enjoys watching Atreyu sleep. Atreyu then rides on the dragon over the same multi-landscape shots, many times (this part was basically an ode to 'Merica!) And, Yeah for green screens!

There's mention of an empress too but really this is mostly a young male viewer movie so she's literally only in the end of it. That's it.

During this entire quest, a large wolf monster decides it must also destroy and kill Atreyu. [ SPOIL ALERT]: Atreyu finally comes vis-a-vis to this wolf creature had a deep philosophical discussion on why people with no hope *cough* depression *cough* are easy to control, and control means power. Dang wolf, that's some real existential stuff there. Nietzsche would be impressed. [SPOIL ALERT]: The confrontation ends with literally no effort at all, where the wolf pretty much just commits suicide. Wow, all that chasing for THAT?!?!

All in all the movie was solid gold for the 80s. If you're not a fan of the plot, then hopefully you can at lest enjoy those awesome synths and totally 80s music!",1404086400,,2713,4.75531914893617

I remembered the story being a lot better than it was.  I never read the novel but the movie just moves very quickly and hops around, often at the expense of the viewer.  I never really felt like I understood the motivations of the characters.  Even though a fantasy, it seemed juvenile in how characters responded to situations; events in the real world just didn't seem believable.

For the fun and frivolous nature of the movie, I give it high marks.  As for the story and character, I would rate it only a 2 stars -- averaging it out to 3 stars.",1403827200,,693,4.333333333333333

However, at the end, there was also a strong message of ""revenge"" which I do not think is something which is good to teach children, that portion could have been left out without spoiling the rest of the lesson of the movie-we have enough problems with children ""bullying"" or trying to get back at others who may have picked on them without having to drive that point home!

To truly understand what this movie is telling you , watch it more than once. Just watching it once and not truly understanding the underlying story would be an injustice to yourself.

This is not just a kids movie , although kids will love it , they will not understand the true meaning , but thats fine.

As an adult watching this movie and understanding what is really being told , you can come away with a whole new understanding of life.

Yes , it is that kind of movie.

It is a work of fiction , but I ask you , what is real and what is an illusion ?

Watch it have some fun , then watch it again and understand.

You will enjoy.

My husband and I remembered The Neverending Story well and we were excited to share it with our kids,  but this is no Princess Bride (CLASSIC!). We expected it to look cheesy, and it does, but we didn't expect the movie to be so lame. The acting sucks and we were never engrossed so I found myself thinking things like, ""how could I have EVER found that dog-dragon cool?"" instead of caring about Atreyu and their planet. I watch movies and read books to escape but I never forgot all the other things I needed to get done like laundry or cleaning. My husband literally fell asleep (we started the movie at 7:00 pm on s Saturday and he is only 32 years old!). There are numerous write ups about the actual plot, so I don't need to rehash that.  I just wanted to say that the movie is not engaging and other than the last 10 to 15 minutes, it is a complete waste of time.

Even though it's on BluRay, it's not comparable to today's movies but it's not the fault of the manufacturer.  It is better than the old VHS I had of it ;-)

I love the story because it shows that so much can be found in a book when you let your imagination soar.  I play lots  of video games and my career is in software development but I still love a good book (physical books, not ebooks).

621778,5,6303212395,"To begin:

The Neverending Story is a masterpiece. Yes, it's filled with flaws. Yes, it's more of a child's movie. Yes, it's a bit corny. But this movie represents sooooo much more. It represents human fantasy and dreams. This is one of the movies I watched as a child that made me love fantasy. I grew up watching this movie and loved it so much and watching it on Blu-ray is amazing.

Quality:

From what I can gather, the back cover of the movie say's ""HD"" but it actually looks closer to DVD quality. The movie is in a wide screen format, and even on wide screen TV (16:9 ratio) it will still look like a movie screen format. The Blu-ray case and disc are good quality and well worth the money. It shipped on time and was actually faster than I expected. Video quality seems to be DVD SD level, but it COULD have been cleaned up more than it seemed. The ""Nothing"" moments (swirling clouds of darkness) actually did look to be in HD.

Special Features: None

Nostalgia Factor: High

Over All: Good product. If you liked this movie as a kid, you will still love it when you are older. This movie has a charm that never goes away. Seeing this movie in ""HD"" is pretty awesome. I highly recommend this movie, though if you can find it on DVD, you might be better off as far as the price goes.",1398902400,,1291,4.270491803278689

621955,4,6303212395,"I'm a child of the 80's so this movie is a concentrated dose of pure nostalgia. I used to own the DVD but when I wanted to share it with younger friends who'd never seen it I realized someone had taken it from my collection. So I bought here on Amazon and we devoured it with no problems.

This was one of my favorite movies growing up and it had a lot to do with planting the seeds of my lifelong obsession with the fantasy (and later scifi) genres of fiction.

The characters are classic and the monsters/creatures are old school animatronics/puppets so there's no odd out of place CGI.

It's a great watch for a family or anyone interested in how imagination applied to fantasy movies before the rampant reliance on computer imagery that is abused (imo) a little too much in these modern times.",1395532800,2,797,4.445205479452055

We decide where the beginning becomes the middle and find where we think the end begins.  There are just too many teaching points to list!! I love this movie!",1395532800,,451,4.385542168674699

621960,5,6303212395,"While some of the magic is gone, being a jaded adult, the message rings through clearer than ever.  I didn't know there was a book, and that the movie only adapts the first half of it.  I have ordered both the paperback and hardcover.  I found a handmade leather dust cover on Etsy that goes with the hardcover book so it looks very close to what it looks like in the movie.  There is a $200 edition of the book here on Amazon, but it's not that accurate.  I really wish someone would make an accurate replica of the book seen in the movie.  I would pay hundreds for it.

Anyway, the movie is a masterpiece on its own.  I was hesitant to watch it, as I didn't want to ruin the fond memories I had of it as a child.  But, surprisingly, it was great.  The message of the importance of hope and imagination were what I got from it for the first time, as I was only 12 years old or so the last time I watched it.  Einstein would be proud lol

Truly a classic movie.  It's a crying shame that the sequels are straight garbage.  I tried watching The Neverending Story II for free on Amazon Prime (heads up Amazon Prime members, if you can stomach that terrible movie), but could only get about halfway before me and the wife looked at each other and agreed that we couldn't keep watching.  It was that bad.  So, I'm excited to read the book.  I want to know the rest of Bastian's story!

Now, onto the Bluray itself.  It's not the best of picture quality, but not bad by any means.  Some scenes are worse than others.  There is a menu but no special features.  The options are: Play, Language, Scenes.  That's it.  It's been nearly 30 years since the theatrical release, so it would be nice to get a 30th Anniversary edition with commentaries and other extras.  I would totally double dip and not even feel bad about it.  That's how much I love this movie.",1395014400,,1850,4.229226361031519

622072,5,6303212395,"It has everything... humor, suspense, sadness, hope, redemption, you name it.  It's something you could show your kids every year, and they will get more out of it each time as they mature.  A favorite of mine as a kid, and now as an adult to show my children.

PS - In response to the small percentage of reviewers who did not like the movie... I would suggest they go back and try watching it again.  I think they have missed the whole point.  Again, it's a movie to grow on, with bigger ideals and meaning than most movies we have now become accustomed to watching.  It's a real roller coaster for younger kids, including fear and suspense.  Some may not be able to watch all of the scenes the first time through.  My youngest didn't - but this time she did.  It's a deep appreciation kind of movie.  A real art some may argue we've lost in all of our special affects.  This movie has heart!  The ""scary scene"" contains important information about the movie.  If you don't listen to the story as it unfolds, I can see why you might not like it.  It requires listening and processing.  I don't see that as a fault to the movie.  Without giving any spoilers away... if you did not cry or at least feel like crying during a certain very sad and intense scene in this movie, than you can not claimed to have watched it... because you never engaged with it.  It's not something to listen to in the background, it's an adventure to experience.

I'm glad so many of us have enjoyed this movie!",1393977600,,1489,4.333333333333333

I've seen parts of it on tv 20 years ago, but not until this evening did I watch it straight through. Wouldn't want to buy to own, but decided to rent it from Amazon Instant Video for a cheap movie night in. Not for nothing, technology can be good, but there is nothing like reading a good book and letting your imagination take flight. I don't have the book, but if I had a copy, I'll read it and imagine myself being ten years old again, stuck in a paperback book (Kindles weren't around in 1993). That's the joy of reading and was the point, to me anyway, in this movie. The scene with the bookshop owner hit it: Imaging your Captain Nemo in your submarine about to be attack by a squid, or being Robinson Crusoe on a deserted island.

The audio is a real shame because the music and score were excellent at the time of release. Also, no bonus supplements are provided. The Dutch BD import was likewise devoid of extras. A deluxe Blu-ray loaded with 3 hours of documentaries, commentaries and interviews would rate higher. It seems Warner Bros. did not take this film very seriously because not even a trailer is provided. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star release.

622747,5,6303212395,"This little sleeper of a film had modest theater success and even won a few awards in Europe. Noah Hathaway also was recognized with a nomination for Best at the Young Artist Awards and did win the Best Young Artist at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films (USA), But it is as a rental and now as a purchase that it has found major success. Word of mouth between kids and parents has made this film huge. It has Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, Outbreak) for director & screenwriter and a very talented cast.

But the bottom line is it has the magic of great storytelling. It captures the imagination of young and old alike with fears, tears and finally cheers. This is a film that the whole family can enjoy together. For the very young it should be watched in one sitting as a few scenes are very sad or a bit scary; but all comes out fine in the end. If you aren't sure if your little one is ready for this film, first watch it yourself. You won't mind watching it twice. In fact, if your kids are like mine and now my granddaughter are you'll be watching it lot.

I rate it 4.5 as I take off for the somewhat cheesy special effects/visual effects. But now that I think about it, perhaps like the Luck Dragon, it is by design part of the charm of the movie. It brings out the child in all of us but that's another story. :)",1377907200,,1341,4.214007782101167

The characters, which we first meet in modern day, were sympathetic and relatable. Bastien, a mid-age youngster mourning his mother, takes refuge in a bookstore after being accosted by bullies. The shopkeeper, a man with a decided air of mystery, proffers a ""dangerous"" book; then conveniently turns his back allowing Bastien to make off with it. Holed up in a stuffy storage attic of his school with a thundersorm raging without, the magic begins to happen. He is suddenly immersed in a fantasy world that's being slowly dissolved by The Nothing. And the book is naming HIM as its saviour. ""That's impossible!"" he screams to a rain-pounded pane. But the book continues to write him into the story, following the footsteps of a hero his own age. He meets a variety of improbably appealing characters (the Luck Dragon was my favorite) and we move on through fearful obstacles and morality lessons toward a triumphal conclusion.

622896,5,6303212395,"I remember every part of the movie since the days of VHS tapes when I was a kid back during the early 90s and I loved it a lot. The characters, the environment, the time that I know the place is about to crumble, the big flying character when the lady stuck him from the top and it hurt, the kid screaming, everything that I remember when I traveled back through the memory lane is there. If you love fantasy movies like I do (I wish I could live in such a fantasy world, but that would be impossible), get this movie. If you love the 80s music like I do, get this movie.

How I found The Neverending Story is when I went through YouTube for some 80s music and I thought I'd search for new 80s-style music that were made recently, but I don't think so. But in a positive note, I found a compilation of music (in order of year from 1980 to 1989 if I remember which is not a lot of songs there) and in the featured video list, I saw something like ""Best 80s Compilation Music Part 4"" or something like that (no quotes) and I started by going from part 1 and stopped at part 6 or 7, which is when I heard ""The Neverending Story."" I thought I remember that song is in the movie, so I did a search in the Internet and there I am in the Amazon product page so I've ordered a digital movie to watch instantly. And man, what a blast from the past taken me back through my memory lane!

I don't know why that name of the movie (not what's in the movie but I'm talking about the title of the movie) left my memory lane! I did remember the part when a man is about to end his dream by jumping off the cliff towards the waterfall. I think that's the second one that my loved one have sent me a recorded copy of the VHS tape for me to watch (does anyone remember blank VHS tapes?). I felt sad that I don't know what to do with them.",1371945600,,1819,3.9808219178082194

623009,5,6303212395,"Last night I decided to revisit one of my favorite films as a child: The Neverending Story. I was a little nervous that the movie wouldn't be as good as I remembered, but thankfully it was. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, this 1984 film was met with mostly positive reviews upon its release. While the film grossed less in the U.S. than it cost to make, worldwide it pulled in more than $100 million and went on to become one of the best-selling home video releases ever.

The Neverending Story is based on the first half of the fantasy novel of the same name by Michael Ende. While I plan on reading the novel, I have yet to do so; therefore I can't compare the two. However, nearly 30 years later, the movie is still as visually stunning as I remember. Watching Atreyu traverse Fantasia in search of a way to save the Empress, was as spellbinding as I remembered. And the wonderfully majestic score, composed by Klaus Doldinger, brought back great memories, as well as the title song, which was composed by legendary disco producer Giorgio Moroder.

If you've never seen this movie, I highly recommend it. While some of the special effects look dated, the majority of them are still wonderful. More importantly, the acting is excellent and the story is charming. It's a wonderful film for those young and old, and it still ranks high on my list of all-time favorite films.",1367884800,,1373,4.622950819672131

There was probably some nostalgia, but also scenes I had forgotten. It's been over 20 years. The visuals are really quite beautiful. Almost all of the special effects/ animatronics hold up as well as or better than modern CGI, which is surprising (or maybe not) and even better than most other movies from the era. Things like Falkor looking happy to have his ear scratched were amazing. The only weak part is a few superimposed images of Falkor flying, but they aren't bad. The story holds up as well since it is so literary grounded and those books and concepts aren't going anywhere.

My kids saw it for the first time and really enjoyed it. There were a few scary parts that I am pretty sure scared me a lot more as a child.

So the new blu ray transfer was very pretty, the subtitles were well done, but the only thing lacking was special features of which there are none. Not even a theatrical trailer. Still, the main presentation was great, so I highly recommend this version.",1362268800,,1104,4.542713567839196

623236,5,6303212395,"For those who remember renting Wolfgang Petersons The Neverending Story on VHS from their towns video store, it may occupy a special place on their shelfnot to mention in their heartand it should. It certainly occupies both of mine. For those who have never seen it, be prepared to be amazed.

The Neverending Story makes the ultimate example of getting caught up in an experience. Based on a children's fantasy novel by the German author Michael Ende, the plot concerns a boy reading a book and by doing so, becoming able to journey inside that book to wonder around in a real parallel universe. Fantasia, (or Fantastica in the book, probably a riff of the word fantasy) is being destroyed by humanity's lack of imaginationa nameless monster called The Nothing is literally eating space, leaving void in its wake. To get home, the boy must trek to the Ivory Tower to find an an ill princess and give her a new name, thus restoring the status quo. Two journeys are followed here: Bastion Balthazar Bux who reads The Neverending Story book, and Atreyu Greenskin the warrior, who has to find him and bring him from 1980s America into Fantasiaand maybe back again.

Filled with excellent special effects (considered groundbreaking for the day), lifelike puppet creatures similar to those of the Star Wars films, mayhem, drama, and adventurenot to mention a long list of fantastical creatures including a dragon, comical gnomes, and a giant turtle, this movie will entertain without repulsing. Violence is minimal and no profanity or gore.  Only serious elements like loss are examined, such as Atreyu s horse disappearing in a bog, along with threats from a frightening wolf near the movies climax.

On a personal level, no other film in my time, except perhaps Peter Jacksons fantasies like King Kong or The Lord of the Rings, has seized my attention the way this film (and later book) has done. I loved to read as a child, so the idea of being raptured as it were, into a book, of all things, totally fascinates me still today. The progression of events follows Campbells mythic structure to a tee. The only drawback to a film this short (at 90 minutes) remains obviously that the crew lacked the vision, ability, and tools in the 80s to see Michael Endes story through. If you have read the book, then you know two stories (one Atreyus, followed by Bastions) make up the entire work. Like the book Jurassic Park, and Tolkiens ring stories-turned films, much has been left to the viewers imagination. I still love the movie, and would rather have the story told a different way onscreen than have a parrot-back of what I read in the book. All three of these adaptations are absolutely fantastic, and we all would be so lucky to have any kind of attention paid to our fiction.

Kids of all ages will identify with the neglected and outcast Bastion, and parents will appreciate the simple moralalways keep childlike innocence about you and use (or lose) your imagination This movie is a classic. Despite grown-up themes and serious incidents of exploration, you will be mesmerized. The movie is rated PG for frightening images and thematic elements.

623376,5,6303212395,"The Never Ending Story, based on a German series of novels, is a timeless tale of an epic journey. For young and old alike, viewers of this film will experience the wonder of imagination, and feel inspired to think about the myths and legends that inform our own life journeys. Yes, the movie may seem outdated as far a special effects go, but that should not really matter to fans of science fiction or fantasy who enjoy good storytelling. All of the stages of a hero's journey are beautifully told in this film, mirroring Joseph Campbell's theory that myths are created by us to inform us of our destiny and place in the cosmos. This tale is timeless, and perfectly captures the epic journey of rising above your own doubts an fears to embrace your destiny. The special effects for this time won this film numerous accolades in the 1980's. I will caution you all NOT to watch the sequels of this film, as they veer far from the original vision of the books and ruin the story.

In fact, I was probably a lot like Bastian, really getting into the story and living it, and it felt like it went on for ages as you traveled with the characters.  As an adult, my first reaction was ""wow, is the movie over already?""  It just went so much faster and while it still had charm, I couldn't believe the different perspective I had.

Bastian lives with his father after the death of his mother.  A small boy and quiet by nature, he is often the target of bullies.  It is on one day, when he is running from said bullies, that he stumbles into a store where an old man shows him a mysterious book called The Neverending Story.  Knowing he has to read it, Bastian slips out of the shop with the book (but assures the owner in a note he'll bring it back) and takes it to school.  There in the attic, he starts to read the book and becomes a part of a world called Fantasia, where the nothingness is taking over and the empress is dying and only a young boy named Atreyu can help save it.  But to do so he must go on a dangerous journey, where his wit and skills will be tested.

Characters:
Barret Oliver: Bastian Bux
Noah Hathaway: Atreyu
Tami Stronach: The Empress
Alan Oppenheimer: Falkor, Gmork, Rock Biter and the Narrator
Moses Gunn: Cairon
Sydney Bromley: Engywook

I don't really remember caring either way about Bastian as a child.  As an adult I find him a tad annoying, but at least his imagination and zest for reading is charming.  And he does seem like a realistic little boy.  Oliver did a good job filling the role.  Hathaway as Atreyu was quite good too.  He had to do a lot of different things in the movie and he pulled them off admirably.  He had the right amount of spunk that brave Atreyu needed as well.  The only other character that got a ton of screen time was Falkor and since he was a dragon, his voice was appropriately deep and commanding (as done by Oppenheimer).  He's a likable dragon though, with a certain jovialness to him that's appealing.  The other characters are all neat, but they play small roles and in my opinion, not used to the best of their abilities.  But they do paint the picture for what Fantasia is like.

This is an adventure movie.  It's based off of a book (which I have not yet read but will eventually) and I can't really say how well it follows the book.  I'm assuming well since it seems like the author had a big hand in how the movie was made.  As said before though, while this movie went slowly as a child, it moves very very fast as an adult.  Almost rushed.  So as much as I would like to give it the highest rating, there are some flaws there that nostalgia just can't fix for me.  This is a kids movie, and it's appropriate for kids, however, there are some very hard themes that are expressed in it.  Loss, violence, sorrow; just to name a few.

For being made in the eighties, this movie had some decent special effects.  The dragon Falkor alone was well done and lifelike, and even a bit scary for a young child.  Likewise the other characters had neat costumes.  The only thing I really found hokey would be the castle in the end, it was just a little out there.  But really, well done.  And then there's the music.  Epic music, I loved all of it.  Mainly because it brought back memories but there's just something so catchy about it all, and it was written specifically for the movie so it's very fitting as well.

This movie brings back a lot of memories, and while it's not quite what I remembered it's still very good.  It's one of those movies that all ages will like too so it's a good one for family night.  Enjoy this jewel!

623701,1,6303212395,"I usually never spend my time writing reviews of movies or products. But in this case I felt I had to vent about this utter disappointment that Warner Home Video has produced. This review is not about the movie itself so much as the Blu-ray and it's shortcomings. Especially when compared to the DVD which says a lot because there was only ever 1 DVD release of this fantastic film and it was even among the first generation of DVDs produced, and it STILL whoops the Blu-ray's ass no contest.

This release is a horrible injustice to anyone who is a fan of this movie and has been eagerly been anticipating its ""upgraded"" Blu-ray version. I loved this movie as a kid and I still love it as an adult. Plot & story aside, the movie is quite literally a cinematic work of art. A true visual & aural masterpiece of the fabled 80s era of movies that a lot of us grew up with. To this day there are very few true fantasy films out there, and this one has always been among the classic greats of my generation.

If ever a movie deserved a top quality re-transfer & release, it is this one. Not many people have never heard of The NeverEnding Story. The DVD release was actually pretty damn good. and I could understand why Warner Bros. stepped back and decided it didn't need a 2nd release on DVD. But then in 2006 Blu-ray made its debut, and many of us avid movie collectors became very excited about the prospect of seeing the movies that we grew up with look so good in pristine 1080p.

At first I was a bit jaded about the whole thing, because I had already spent so much money over the years amassing my vast DVD collection. And now here comes big bad Blu-ray to try to make me start all over again and make my DVDs look inferior by comparison. But when the prices came down I decided to give Blu-ray a chance, and am so happy I did because it is (usually) a massive step up from DVD. But not this one... : ( Nope, this disc is a waste of both money and of plastic.

I have seen what this format is truly capable of. Even on older movies, if true care is put into them, the Blu-ray release can make a movie look like it was shot yesterday with a digital film camera. They could have extended that level of care to this epic masterpiece that Wolfgang Peterson created. But instead they just half-assed its transfer & ""clean-up"" and got it out on store shelves just as fast as they could to make a quick buck off of unsuspecting hopefuls like myself. Truly intolerable.

First of all, they made NO effort at ALL to clean up the picture quality. There is grain grain grain. Grain everywhere throughout the film. Even the glorious opening credits look like trash. Had they truly given a damn, they could have taken the original negative and ran it through todays much more advanced & thorough telecine filters & digital encoders. They could have made the picture absolutely flawless. And they definitely SHOULD have. But they didn't do anything of the sort.

I mean they did a pretty good job cleaning up this film for DVD compared to the VHS release for what it was. That was back in the late 90s. We've come a long way since then and they could have taken the digital restoration efforts to a whole new level. Eliminated every spec of grain and made this film look brand spankin' new. Sure, the picture is sharper than the DVD only because it's now presented in 1080p. But that really just means more defined grain in this case.

Next up is color. Whatever lazy idiot was put in charge of this specific title, that person should really look into another line of work. Because they clearly attempted some form of crappy color correction here by vastly & obviously changing whole entire palettes throughout the film. It's especially apparent in the first few chapters of the Blu-ray  right after Bastian starts reading the book. Especially the one where the Ivory Tower is revealed for the first time. It's almost entirely ORANGE!! God it looks absolutely hideous! The once vibrant & picturesque colors are now all washed out and dull, and completely drowned out but the orange hue they implemented.

They messed with the hues & saturation levels all over the film, but it's the worst here. And this was one of the coolest parts of the movie. The introduction to Fantasia and to the story's hero and to the quest he must undertake. All garbage now. On top of all that, they lowered the brightness considerably everywhere. But especially here. Now it's so dark that you can barely see what the heck is going on. When Atreyu leaves on his horse Artax, you can't even see it because it's so dark!

I get what these sloppy fools were trying achieve here. Something to do with ""The sun was setting, so we thought it would be better if we stayed more consistent with that by flooding the scenes with orange sunlight. And then by the time Atreyu takes off, it would be already nearly dark, so let's try to fix that now, shall we?"" Idiots. Amateurs. All they really did was drag the picture quality through the digital mud. It's freakin' FANTASIA for God's sake! Time & true-to-life color have no meaning here!

If you play the DVD and the Blu-ray together and make the visual comparison, you will quite clearly see the vast differences I have pointed out. The DVD is brighter, more vivid, and most importantly truer to the original release. The film-makers & production designers made their choices and they were good ones. Who are these jokers to mess with that? It looked way WAY better the way it was originally.

Look. Bottom line here, people, is that this is an all around failure of a Blu-ray transfer. It does NOT enhance the experience one bit. Visually I mean. Sure it's 1080p now. But what good is that if it still looks like crap? They actually managed to make it WORSE than it was before, on the most modern medium. It's like they just transfered the VHS to a Blu-ray disc. In fact the only improvement they DID make was the sound is now the lossless DTS 5.1 mix. So if you're blind, this is a sensible upgrade to buy.

I hope & pray that Warner Home Video does the right thing in time and sees these flaws for what they are and decides to step up to the plate and give this movie a REAL Blu-ray release where there is NO grain anymore, the colors are preserved & enhanced, the brightness levels are left as they were and it just all around looks incredible when compared to the DVD and this terrible first Blu-ray release. But considering it only ever got 1 DVD release, it's a slim chance that'll happen. I wanna cry.

If I was Wolfgang Peterson, I would take more pride in my movies and ensure they when they get released to the world on a new medium, that they're getting the attention to detail that they need to have. If I wanted to show this movie to my kids or to someone who has never seen it before, I would pull out the DVD and watch it in 720p, rather than have their 1st experience with this timeless classic be this trashy Blu-ray.

DO NOT BUY THIS STEAMING PILE OF CRAP BLU-RAY. I promise you you will be summarily & thoroughly let down with what you witness. Case closed.",1346544000,26,7087,4.424079754601227
623702,4,6303212395,"This video was pretty entertaining. I was a little hesitant to watch it, seeing as it was made in 1984, but the storyline is very interesting and kept me unaware of what would happen next. It was equal parts magical, whismical, and fantastical. The 1980's special effects were a little strange (compared to how realistic special effects and cgi makes everything look now). Overall, fun. The little boy who played Atreyu was so cute - who knew he would grow into a man with tattoos all over both arms. The child empress played her part well. I think the rock biter was probably one of my favorite characters. I enjoyed watching him eat rocks.",1341014400,3,641,4.631578947368421
623703,3,6303212395,"In the fantasy/SF- crowded year of 1984, we also got this, ""The Neverending Story.""
Being a lifelong SF/fantasy film fan, this one was certainly a part of my childhood, although I quickly relegated it to second or third tier interest, seeing it only once in a great while. After well over a decade of not seeing it, I watched it again while comparing its two soundtracks. The New -Wave/-Age-ish title ballad is one of the better songs of the genre, and the actual score has its moments. Oddly, I found myself often comparing this to the same year's ""Supergirl.""

One scene sums up my attitude to this movie, then or now, which prevented me from taking it as seriously as other fantasy/SF flicks. When he reads about the death of Artax (Atreju's trusty horse), it's scored by a standard, unengaging death march, and the overacting is rife on both boys' faces. While I am saddened by the death of any animal (and most people), the scene was either flat or eye-rolling for me. If I didn't suspect it already, by then I *knew* this was a movie I wouldn't be able to take very seriously. Oh, it picked up and improved and had some nice scenes and plot points and characterizations thereafter, but for all intents and purposes it had already reduced itself to a standard-issue cut-and-dry fantasy movie, albeit with some really sweet visuals and some decent bits of score.

While there's something to be said for the theme of preserving and encouraging imagination, it just seems so lame that 'Bastian wastes almost the entire movie escaping reality and responsibility (in his school's storage room, no less); he ironically refuses to use/release his imagination until the very last second; and then solves his bully problem by scaring them into dumpsters. Jeez, he has no future at this rate.

Yes, this movie is pure cheese: it's not as stinky as limburger, it's not sharp as cheddar, it's more like standard American cheese, mass-produced and shrink-wrapped for your average ordinary sandwich. It's not great, but it's healthy and good enough to revisit once in a while.

I particularly liked the Rock Monster and his lament about how his ""good, strong hands"" no longer did the job. Viewing it now as a senior in 2012, the movie seems dated and a little clumsy. Some of the magic wore off, maybe from me. It's still a good story, but not quite in the category I want for DVD's that I buy: something that will be enjoyable in repeated viewings.

The audio is also done very well, and if I remember correctly it is in 5.1 surround for the first time. No complaints there.

623758,5,6303212395,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""The Neverending Story"" is a 1984 fantasy film from director Wolfgang Petersen.  Loosely adapted from Michael Ende's book of the same name(in its English translation from the original German), it stars Barret Oliver and Noah Hathaway.

The movie tells the story of Bastian Bux(Oliver) and his compelling imaginative and psychological connection to the mythical land of Fantasia.  After essentially stealing the title tome from a grumpy and strange bookstore proprietor, Bastian reads it alone in a school attic as his fertile mind devours the odd story.  Arguably no other film makes such an effective, all-encompassing statement regarding the pyschological and emotional connection between readers and their books.  Noah Hathaway delivers a richly nuanced performance as the child warrior Atreyu, called on to save Fantasia from the murderous grasp of The Nothing.  The concept and function of The Nothing as detailed in the movie is extremely imaginative, and occasionally potentially very frightening for young children.

Produced in an era before widespread computer-generated effects in movies, the wild landscapes of Fantasia are still extremely impressive.  Atreyu's flight through the sky with the kind luckdragon Falkor and slog through the dreary Swamps of Sadness are visual highpoints.  However, the movie is rated a stern PG for mature and violent content.  The tone makes for an overall classic, but also a film that should be screened by parents or guardians before very young children see it.

""The Neverending Story""  is an enduring classic fantasy film.",1326931200,2,1588,5.48559670781893

A pity, but the problem was that if they tried to tell the whole story, it would be absurdly long. Perhaps a sequal would have been the best solution (despite my detestation of sequels)

All that aside, I must say that I thought the movie was superb. It has something sadly lacking in so many movies today (adult or childrens): a really good story.

I thought the acting was above average; something which is quite rare with child actors.

Special effects were good - good enough to be convincing (special effects don't make a movie, but in a fantasy like this, it is vital that they be convincing)

The story is a powerful moral message about meaning and life. And in the drama, the movie captured perfectly the tension of this struggle to reach out and grasp life.",1315699200,,864,4.484076433121019
623828,5,6303212395,"What can you say about Wolfgang Peterson's Neverending Story? To me, it defines childhood memories and 80's fantasy films.

  It's about a young imaginative book reader Bastian played by Barret Oliver, who runs into a small libary while escaping from some bullies. In there, he finds a book known as ""The Neverending Story"" which was being read by the cranky libarian who forbids Bastian from reading it. Bastian being both curious and interested decides to borrow the book. From here, Bastian reads the book while hiding in the school's attic. As Bastian reads, he learns that the book is telling the tale of the fantasy world of Fantasia which is being destoryed by a myserious force known as The Nothing. The people of Fantasia look to The Childlike Empress played by Tami Stronach for help. However, she has fallen deathly ill due to the presence of the Nothing. Now, the only hope lays in the hands of the young warrior Atreyu played by Noah Hathaway who must find a cure for The Empress before The Nothing destorys Fantasia.

  Watching this film is like watching Star Wars. The world of Fantasia is a highly imagintive world with it's own uniqe characters and creatures. This is WAY before the time of CG and when people used puppets and costumes to create this incredible world. Just like Star Wars, every character is unforgetable in this film. Falkor, the wise and optimistic luck dragon is easily the film's most memorable character. Who else as a kid wanted to go flying on Falkor's back? The voice by Alan Oppenheimer (best known for the voice of Skeletor in He-Man)is fantasic and it helps bring the character to life. My personal favorite character from this film is The Rock Bitter, the kindly rock eating giant. Everytime I see him, my childhood flashes before my eyes. Of course, this movie wouldn't be much without an evil character like Gmork. The evil wolf, hired by The Nothing to track down and kill Atreyu before he can find a cure. Gmork's green eyes and evil presence makes him a truly scary character in a child friendly film. I could spend this whole review talking about the characters like Morla, Nighthob and Teeny Weeny. But that would take foever. Besides the characters, another key element of this film is the settings, from the school's dark attic to the gloomy Swaps of Sadness help charaterize this film. The music by Klaus Doldinger is simply fantasic. Bastian's Happy Flight is the true theme of nostalgia. This film also has it's fair share of sad moments, such as the death of Atreyu's horse which still gets me into tears. The camera work is also a very big strong point. A perfect example would be the scene in which Gmork is catching on to Atreyu in the Swamps of Sadness. That scene is a true gripping moment for both the viewers and the characters.

623830,5,6303212395,"The Neverending story is about Bastian (Barret Oliver) a shy kid who has lost his mom and is bullied by other kids but stills remains inspired by the books he reads. Thus he encounters ""The Neverending Story"" a book about Fantasia and its fight against ""The Nothing"" an entity which is making the land and its people disappear. There he reads about Atreyu the warrior (Noah Hathaway) and his efforts to save the princess and the empire of Fantasia. Sounds like your typical children fare. But its in its execution an non-linear development where it succeeds. The creators where not afraid to introduce heavier elements into the story, Artax fate in the mud still remains one of the saddest things I seen. It also means that small children will likely be terrified by some of the creatures and scenarios displayed here. Like a pair of towering statues killing a man for simply walking between them. But that's what is cool about it I think, its not simply about looking at the pretty unicorns but sometimes you also need something truly threatening in order to spark your interest and emotions and after all is also about facing your fears and rising to the occasion. The Neverending Story makes us wonder, frightened, care. Because like Bastian at the end even though we have lived a fantasy the feelings felt were real. As a kid I used to watch it religiously every time it would air on TV and now as an adult revisiting it again in glorious HD quality is re-discovering it all over again. Not only I am able to see the details on every creature I never saw before but I'm again completely immersed into the story. I have to say that the special effects here are amazing. This was before CGI so everything here had to be puppets or people in costumes and maybe is just me but the creatures here look more real than most creatures in recent movies.",1311984000,2,1848,4.586102719033232

I look exactly like Barret Oliver, even talk like he does and my hair has more German bouncy colorful curls than anyone and my skin is olive gold tan colored (I used to be VERY pale of course) from my Polish and long eyelashes, huge almond shaped brown eyes too, with a short tongue so I can not pronounce a lot of different words. My past is in the 80's, when people were into family and love. No one would believe it if I told them, but my eyes are highly reflective and glow in the right lighting and create a hall of mirrors when I look in the mirror. See, you don't believe me. There is not one doubt in my mind of who I am, I live in San Jose, and if you ever went there downtown, it is JUST like the books movie. Also, it is built on sacred land, do not ever think it is a false tail, I went to middle school and if a school bus satchel were in my hands, it would carry a PB sandwich with raisins, my grades were terrible all my youth and I was made fun of (still am, and my mother divorced my father too.)

623972,5,6303212395,"Opening with cheesy 80's Europop and littered from head to toe with dated visuals and hilarious makeup jobs; `The Neverending Story' remains one of my favorite films and one of those childhood memories I wish to hold onto forever.  I can't even count to amount of times I've seen this film; it was basically on repeat throughout the entirety of my childhood.  Being released the year before I was born didn't hurt any.  When I think of iconic moments in my upbringing, the introduction of this film ranks even higher than the first time I saw `The Return of the Jedi'; seriously.

In rewatching this film for the near hundredth time the other night with my young daughter (who was equally amused and yet totally confused) I found myself finding a depth within this film that was completely wasted on my youth.  Having never read the novel (for a film that flaunts the beauty of reading, I never even knew that this was an adaptation) I cannot say if the `meanings' I gathered upon a recent viewing were intended of if they are of my own imaginings, but I must say that this film transcended it's own entertainment value for me the other night, for now it carries with it a heavier weight.

I'm going to scream SPOILERS and get that out of the way right now.

Where to begin with my interpretations is a hard thing to gage, since the themes presented here are varied in themselves and so it's kind of a shot in the dark with where to start.  A brief rundown of the film finds a young boy named Bastian who is finding it difficult to move on after the death of his mother (the cause is never addressed) and he is frequently tormented by bullies and failing his classes and all of this cumulates into a cry for help in the form of...reading.  Yes, Bastian steals a book (which he promises to return) and holes himself up in the attic of his school where he indulges in a fantasy world where he has a direct say in `how the story will end'.  The story revolves around Fantasia, a world that dwells within the `hopes and dreams' of humankind.  A wicked `nothing' is destroying the world, swallowing everything and replacing it with a void.  A young warrior is summoned and sent out to find a cure for the ailing Empress, who is the only one who can stop the Nothing.

The obvious here is that this Fantasia is a representation of Bastian's childhood.  In youth we are smothered with `hopes and dreams' and yet, as we age, we lose those `dreams' and replace them with reality, which is usually far less grand than we anticipated.  There are a number of films that have riffed on this narrative.  I've recently reviewed `The Red Balloon', which tackles this idea, and we are mostly all familiar with 2009's underappreciated masterpiece, `Where the Wild Things Are'.  In `The Neverending Story', Bastian's recent loss of his mother has dissolved his innocence.  He is finding it hard to function in `reality' and he isn't getting any support from those around him.  His own father urges him to `move on', which is not something easily done, especially for a child.  In essence, Bastian's own father is forcing him to grow up way too fast, and all Bastian needs is to remain a child for as long as possible.

What struck me even more so upon this recent viewing was the religious (or so they seem) tremors that streamline this films core.  In a conversation between Atreyu and the evil G'mork, G'mork mentions that the Nothing wants to destroy hope because the loss of hope makes it easier to control people.  When thinking of the war between God and Satan, it seems as if this film (and quite possibly the novel from which it stems) was attempting to illuminate the plight that Satan's influence has had on the world today.  By destroying man's faith, he has stripped away their hope and thus made it easier to control man.

Wow, that's very unlike me (I very rarely mention religion in reviews), but it struck me so powerfully while watching this film that I felt the need to say all that.

Casting the films lyrical intentions aside, the stunning (at times) cinematography and the exciting flow of the films elements make this a great adventure story that still holds up today.  Sure, it's not as polished as some recent fantasy films, but it reminds me of home and that nostalgia will never leave me.  Noah Hathaway's performance is quite terrible, but Barret Oliver's in genuinely fantastic, instantly iconic in its own right.

623978,5,6303212395,"my 2 and 4 year old love this movie. The very first time they were apprehensive, I held them when Gmork appeared. Still they kept asking me to play it. After 2 or three times, they know the story, they know there is nothing to be afraid of. This is a movie I would let my children watch with no hesitation (as opposed to the soul-less insanity all around nowadays like Spongebob, phineas and pherb, chowder, etc) My kids don't even know who those characters are, I'll try to keep it that way.

some reviewers asked: Why is Atreyu the only hope? And why can't he take his bow and arrow.
My answer is that only the heart of a child could pass the first gate to the southern oracle. And only the purity of a child could allow him to pass through the second gate. The burdens of most adults would quickly overcome them in the swamps of sadness. Secondly, the obstacles he faced did not require a bow or arrow or anything physical. It was a quest of inner strength, courage, and, faith.

This is not just a story about a little boy, the book's message is very consistent with spiritual teachings from all manner of religions, this is what makes it a classic. It was to keep our faith, follow our dreams, and never forget the power of the imagination.

There were some reviewers who complained that this movie's title was false advertising, because it ""ended"", or the ones who complained that there is an ""attic above the school"". OH MY GOD, are they serious??? Apparently, these represent the portion of humanity that has been overtaken by the ""nothing"". So pay them no attention. There are plenty of us who still believe. We are keeping fantasia alive in our minds and that is why it's called the neverending story. I loved this movie as a kid, but it was just a movie. It wasn't until recently, as an adult that I realized this movie is not just a story, it is a great metaphor for something real.

624136,5,6303212395,"THE NEVERENDING STORY is a feat in fantasy filmmaking, truly one of the most incredible fantasy adventures ever made. The imaginative character designs and enchanting environments bring the world of Fantasia to life in amazing detail. Director Wolfgang Petersen employs an astonishing array of special effects, from life-like puppets to matte paintings and miniatures that meld together to give the film an epic look unlike any other. Although it is based in childhood fantasy, the film touches on many darker tones and twisted villains that, along with its haunting score, often make for a frightening viewing experience for younger audiences. A series of meaningful and memorable characters are introduced to fight the forces of darkness, characters who personify the values of courage (found in the brave warrior Atreyu), wisdom (shown by the ancient one, Morla), and valor (as seen in the self-sacrifice made by The Rockbiter and others). In the face of such heroism, the corruptive creature that is attempting to destroy this whimsical world fares no chance. On top of the High Fantasy elements the film possesses, it also delivers a powerful message against the death of imagination at the hands of apathetic parents and their disenchanted children. By frequently breaking the fourth wall, THE NEVERENDING STORY engages young Bastian as well as the viewing audience to enter the world of Fantasia and participate in the events as they unfold on screen right beside Atreyu and his companions, thereby saving all who live within this realm. THE NEVERENDING STORY holds a special place beside other timeless classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE DARK CRYSTAL, and LABYRINTH.

624140,5,6303212395,"Still grieving over the loss of his mother, Bastien is often distracted in school and his grades have been suffering. One morning on the way to school, Bastien is tormented by bullies, and he runs to hide in a small, used bookstore. Inside he meets the grumpy owner, who is reading a book with a strange symbol on the cover and insists that his book is not ""safe."" Bastien steals the book when the owner is distracted, promising to return it. He is already late for school when he arrives, so he takes the book up to the attic to read. But soon, Bastien begins to realize that this is no ordinary book. In fact, he is a part of the NeverEnding Story.

The film is based on the original German novel by Michael Ende. And Wolfgang Petersen brought the story to life in 1984, starring Noah Hathaway as Bastien. With brilliant casting, each child actor does an incredible job. And the special effects and creature creations are amazing, especially for the time it was created. The creators made the imaginative land of Fantasia larger than life, as if out of a dream.

I have loved this movie since I was a child. And watching it years later, I was pleased to see it still holds up today, with all of the same charm and wonder. Every child wants to read a book and literally become a part of it. It's an ingenious story that appeals to people of all ages.

Unfortunately, there are no special features in the Blu-Ray edition, apart from the brilliant high definition.  But this shouldn't stop fans from getting their hands on this improved classic.  With non-stop adventure and suspense, fun creatures, and epic fantasy, this heart-warming tale is timeless.",1268611200,,1653,4.589830508474576
624141,4,6303212395,"I imagine most people looking for a review of the Blu-Ray have seen this film before. Still, I want to express my deep and utter respect and love for this amazing movie which still holds up beautifully nearly 3 decades later. Some people may regard it as a film for children, and I suppose that's fine. However, I think when one takes a longer look at not just the visual scope or surface aesthetics of The Neverending Story, they will find a message far deeper and more complex than nearly any ""children's"" film from this past decade.

The new high definition transfer on the disc itself is quite impressive. The clarity and vibrancy has definitely breathed new life into the film, giving the picture far more dimension and detail than anyone has probably seen since its theatrical release. It's fairly obvious that some time and money was spent on restoring and color correcting this film so that it would look beautiful in 1080p HD (THANK YOU WARNER BROS!). The older U.S. DVD from 2001 always appeared to be a bit faded or washed out to my eyes. Not only that, but that print was full of visual flaws such as dirt, scratches, was occasionally out of focus in some shots, and white specs frequently popped up throughout the film. These problems are no longer an issue with this new 2010 transfer for the most part. Colors here are far more vibrant, although purist will be pleased that I detected no hint of DNR and film grain has been left intact to a large degree. Those of you who are used to the old DVD will immediately take notice of the higher black levels in most scenes. This is especially apparent during the first sequences in Fantasia, most notably at the Ivory Tower, which has been restored to its proper evening tones as the sun sets.
Another huge plus in addition to the over-hauled visual presentation is the loss-less 5.1 Audio track. Previous releases have all been in 2.1 stereo and the difference definitely had me sitting up and taking notice! The sub-woofer got a good workout and the rear speakers were very lively throughout the film. Rest assured, the 5.1 track is very tasteful and lacks anything that most would probably label as ""gimmicky"".
However, as pleased as I am with this particular feature presentation of one of my most beloved movies, it's impossible to overlook the complete and utter lack of any kind of bonus material whatsoever. Nothing and I mean NOTHING has been provided in the way of extras here. The previous DVD at least contained a theatrical trailer and production notes. For this reason I am subtracting one star. Let's hope a more ""special"" version of this film is released in the future, perhaps even containing the alternate German cut with 7 minutes of extra footage and certain scenes with alternate (actually, the original) score.

Bottom Line:
Don't let the lack of features keep you from buying this disc, which contains a sparkling new presentation of a haunting film. And is, what I personally consider to be the greatest of all the 80's Fantasy films, up there with Dark Crystal and Legend.",1267574400,16,3056,4.710280373831775

I can say that it saved me in my darkest hour and distributed the very beautiful message to me that creativity is the most powerful force we have against becoming empty ""masses of men who lead lives of quiet desperation."" The idea of the film and book portrays that of what a true genius is: a creator who if indulges too much in his creation loses himself in his work. An unlikely genius... a young boy... who reads about another little boy who takes on a quest with no weapons, no help from anyone, with the anticipation of horrible danger... possible death, and with no chance for success. No sensible adult would take on that quest. I child would when there is no other choice. Tenaciousness and creativity in the realm of impossibilities...

I had the opportunity to watch this again tonight with my kids and couldn't go to sleep without writing something about it.

I am grateful for having been exposed to movies and messages such as this during my childhood, for they helped cultivate in me the belief I needed to not give up on my own dreams. Intelligent, spiritual, hopeful and inspirational, The Neverending Story is essential viewing particularly for those of you with children.

At the essence of the story is the great threat from the `Nothing' which is wiping out the world of dreams and hopes, the world of childhood fantasies, ambitions and goals. For what is left when we lose hope and the will to believe in our own dreams? Nothing.

And what is required to give birth to our dreams, our hopes, the very music buried within our souls? Simply the courage to believe, and to act upon that belief.

With valuable lessons such as believing in your own worth, not succumbing to sorrow and sadness, and believing in your dreams, The Neverending Story is not only entertaining, but of immense value as well.

This is one that children will eat up and parents will enjoy watching with them: both to see their children's eyes light up as well as to simply watch this movie for themselves.

Some of the effects are a little cheesily done by today's standards, but you might be surprised to find that the vast majority are still quite nice even under the more jaded scrutiny of today's audience. That is a testament both of the love and care that was put into constructing this film, and also the simple fact that simple effects, used effectively, can be just as powerful to a story as full CG rendering.

Well, maybe not the plot itself, but the pacing.  This movie goes by WAY too fast.  I don't feel any real connection to Atreyu because the plot moves along to fast and doesn't pose any real threat to him until the very end.  First, after the horse that I didn't care about and is INCAPABLE of emotion died after sinking into the swamp of SADNESS, Atreyu looks pretty depressed, but does he, a human CAPABLE of emotion not sink to his death, well eventually he starts to sink, but why doesn't it happen right away?  Second, why did the film introduce us to the goblin, the rock-biter, and the...other guy, and spend so long establishing them if they have nothing to do with the movie at all.

However, his knowledge of technical filmmaking and his passion for adventure stories proved to be the perfect combination, as can be seen in this campy classic 1984 film.

The story concerns young Bastian, an imaginative boy who prefers to retreat into books rather than face the harsh truths of reality, as he borrows a magical book from a bookstore and reads it in the creepy attic of his school. All his life Bastian has been bullied by other kids at school and misunderstood by his overly practical widower of a father. But as Bastian's mind absorbs the details of the book, The NeverEnding Story, he finds both escapism and empowerment while reading of a heroic young hunter named Atreyu. Atreyu is a member of the Plainspeople and he was chosen to save his world, Fantasia (in the book the fantasy world is known as Fantastica), from the devastation of The Nothing, a living void which spreads across Fantasia devouring all in its path and leaving nothingness in its wake. As Bastian follows Atreyu's daring exploits, he becomes astonished to discover that Fantasia really exists and that he may be the only one who can save it from oblivion, so long as he finds the courage in himself to do as he dreams.

The plot itself deviates from that of the book, but does so in order to make the film accessible to the average viewer.
With a wondrous array of characters and creatures including a Rock Biter, a racing snail, a fearsome wolf-like creature known as the Gmork, a Luck Dragon named Falkor, and the fragile and beautiful Childlike Empress, it's not hard to see why the film has such great appeal.

It revolves around a young boy named Baslian -played by Barret Oliver-who lives with his Dad (Gerald Mcraney)who gets on his case for Basilan's constant daydreaming .He is bullied at school and desperately misses his mother who has recently died .One day he cuts school and wanders into a mysterious bookshop where he picks up a book entitled The Neverending Story and as he begins to read the book the events in the story come to life.
The key figure in the tale is a child like Princess (Tami Stronach).She is ill and fears that if she dies her land ,the land known as Fantasia , will be taken over and its essence destroyed .She sends a young warrior Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) to find a cure for her lingering illness. What menaces Hantasia is a plague of ""nothing"".The people of the land are losing hope and forgetting their apirations and Fantasia is dying as a result. Atreyu's journeyings bring him into contact with all manner of weird and wonderful creatures  ,and gradually Basilian becomes sucked into and becomes part of the story himself.
The tale with its state of the art for its era)animation ,puppetry and prostetics owes a great deal to Alice in Wonderland and ,in some sequences to the science fiction classic The Day the Earth Stood Still. with traces of The Wizard of Oz and The Dark Crystal .The special effects team of Brian Johnson (Alien )and Bruce Nicholson (The Empire Strikes Back)create menacing swamps and spooky wooods on a Bavarian sound stage which arte easily the equal of Industrial Light and Magic  and are  a vital part of a movie which is excellent for children but which also has a vital message for adults .Yes -this is a message movie folks .The warning is clear among the fantasy and charm-it warns of a generation that has turned its back on imagination in favour of media in which everything is laid out on a plate for the audience .It si apen of praise to then power and importance of the imagination .Our imaginations are under threat -amd if that does not worry you ,it sure as Gehenna should!

The message here is a tad simplistic but overall it is a bold ,and daring movie with something to say

It remains ,still,among the best movies of its era",1211414400,3,2356,4.626794258373206
624322,5,6303212395,"Bastian is a young boy of higher than average intelligence and imagination struggling to deal with bullies and the recent death of his mother. The hardships that have befallen his life, along with the hard instruction of an out-of-touch father, have taken their toll on Bastian's ability to fantasize and dream, convincing him that he must grow up and keep his feet on the ground. Luckily for him, while taking refuge in an old bookshop one day on his way to school, Bastian is introduced to ""The NeverEnding Story"". This mysterious book takes his imagination on a daring quest with a young warrior named Atreyu to save a child-like empress and the entire land of Fantasia from the mysterious and terrible Nothing that is sweeping across the land and destroying everything it touches.

If any movies from the now much celebrated 1980's can truly be called classics, ""The NeverEnding Story"" is without a doubt one of the most worthy. It was a time when fantasy films for young people were insanely popular, all with dazzling pre-CGI effects and eerie, otherworldly music, and this film is the finest example.  Based on a famous German book (it's said that the author was not pleased with the film version), ""The NeverEnding Story"" is an exciting and magical tale about the restoration of a boy's imagination against great odds. The land and creatures of Fantasia, while sometimes rather ugly, are brilliantly brought to life, the cast is excellent, and every young boy growing up in the '80's was totally in love with beautiful Tami Stronach as the empress (now a lovely and accomplished dancer). We all also wanted a luck dragon of our own!

The Warner Bros. DVD release could use an update, as all the extras are in the form of text information (little tidbits about the characters and effects), but at least the film is presented in widescreen (on the flip side) and a trailer is included as well. There were two sequels made to ""The NeverEnding Story"", plus a cartoon series and something called ""Tales from the NeverEnding Story,"" which I believe was a live-action TV series. Unfortunately, I haven't seen any of that stuff, so I can't recommend or discourage seeking it out. However, you can't go wrong with the enchanting original!",1205366400,2,2237,4.850785340314136

I grew up loving this movie, from the rock biter, to the flying fog dragon, to the beautiful child empress. It delighted with its fantasy, saddened with its humanity, and frightened with the scary wolf creature!

As an adult, though, I love it just as much. If anything, I appreciate it more, because I understand my childlike love for it, and actually get the jokes and stereotypes that are thrown in.

I would definitely recommend viewing, owning, and loving.

624453,5,6303212395,"There's nothing that beats a classic like the original 1984 version of The Never-ending story ( Die Unendliche Geschichte is the German title).  The Never-ending story is a charming, and heart warming children's film accessible to people of all ages.  It is the ideal in the standards of 1980s fantasy films with very surreal settings and strange yet lovable creatures.

  A boy reads a mysterious storybook to find everything he's reading is happening in a strange yet wonderful other world.  The story teaches about friendship, love, compassion, the value of imagination and belief and of growing up.  The Never-Ending story is such a part of my childhood and has such a powerful hold over my imagination that I still get choked up when I hear the original title track theme song from the film.

  I find it tragic that there are many children today who have not yet seen this enchanting classic film.  The Never-ending story is based on the novel by Michael Ende and has inspired many film sequels as well as a remake (definitely not as good as the original) and an animated series that aired on HBO in the nineteen nineties.

And, we both agree, that this is the only version worth watching.  Neverending Story II doesn't make us give it a thumbs up.

I want a special edition: with a making of documentary highlighting the whole process from the actual book to the script, character sketches and concepts, set design, creature design and building, and all the goodies real film enthusiasts love to watch. And interviews! I mean, even if there is no older footage of the process of making the film can't the people responsible put something together to honor this film.

I had a very similar reaction when I reached the end of this movie.

That's not to say I was disappointed. Quite the contrary. It was like a slap in the face of ""why didn't I think of that?"" Often times the best endings are so obvious you overlook them and this movie is a testament to that fact.

That having been said it's also one of the best fantasy rides you'll ever take in 2 hours. A turtle whose shell is an island. A talking wolf. A luck dragon. Two sets of sphinx like characters, both offering riddles. A horse whose own sadness nearly is is undoing... oh and a rock biter.

These are just a few of the fanciful elements that make this very under-celebrated movie worth high praise!

If you saw it as a child and you now have children, show it to your children. Make it something you share for generations. You'll be glad you did.

They don't make movies like this any more. The more we can teach our children to have imaginations, the more likely they are to dream big dreams... and the more likely they are to turn those dreams into reality.",1183680000,2,1274,4.3544303797468356

624567,5,6303212395,"I have always loved this movie. Even when I was a child. I saw it for the first time when I was about 6 or 7 and fell in love with it. This movie and my parents influence nurtured my love for reading. I think this is an excellent example of how good it feels to get lost in a book. I remember crying on the sad parts (Rock man: ""These look like big, strong hands, don't they""), getting crazy chills on the scary parts and being so excited when the good/heroic things happened (to not give away too much info to those who read this and haven't seen the movie). To this day, some 20 years later, I get the same emotional reactions when I watch this movie.

There aren't many movies like this one out today. In a society that pushes technological advances that overshadow the joys of reading there need to be more movies like this one. That shows the benefit and fun of ""curling up with a good book."" I don't know if this is a movie for young children or not. Like I said, I saw this for the 1st time when I was 6 or 7 and while some parts did scare me, I loved every minute of it and I understood that it wasn't real. I think parents or older siblings should screen the movie before letting younger children watch it, and make your own decision based on what you know about the child you are thinking about allowing to watch this movie. That's what my father did for me and it worked.

If you are looking for a movie with a great plot, story line, and effects that don't overshadow the story, but help you get lost in it just as well, this is the movie to read.

FYI: If you can get your hands on the book, read it!!! The movie isn't the whole story.",1165363200,4,1648,4.080246913580247

The Neverending Story is a story about a small boy named Bastian who loses his mother and is told by his father to ""deal with his pain"" and grow up past the need for all his escapist fantasy books. Having read everything from Tarzan to the Lord of the Rings, Bastian discovers a book called the Neverending Story, and finds his way into the most fascinating ride of his life.

The creatures and fantasy beings in the story are incredibly unique and fun to watch. We really liked the Rock Biter, and the Swamps of Sadness.

The Neverending Story shares many wonderful endearing qualities with films such as the Wizard of Oz and Jumanji. If you are looking for a pure, simple and exciting escape, and a great movie for all ages, you can't go wrong owning this DVD. This is one our family bought.

The dubbing is atrocious (funny Germans), and the costumes and ""effects"" are flat-out bad. Labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days, and easily trumped Neverending Story when it was released two years later.

624624,5,6303212395,"I watched this movie again last night. I haven't seen it in 20 years, so I was wondering if it was still as good as I remembered. Well, it turned out to be pretty darn corny. That's okay though, because it IS a movie for kids after all. I just wish it had grown on me more. Mainly I was just wishing that I was watching something else, or that the movie would speed up a little. It is slow and ponderous. Or maybe I am just too darn old. It's still a good movie, worth 5 stars no doubt.

One interesting effect was on the version I was watching. I was watching it recorded off of TV, with captions. The captions were all in white words as usual, except for Gmork the evil wolf-thing. His words were displayed on the screen in a frighteningly-cool green-colored lettering that matched his eyes. That's not something you see too often. So that was pretty neat.

The movie did creep me out at one point though. The Empress is explaining to Atreyu that a little human boy is watching them and listening to their every move, and that other people were watching him in turn and have also shared in his pains. (Or something to that effect.) Wow, how creepy is that? That gave me the shivers! How could she have known right then that it would be me who was watching that movie 20 years later? I mean, how would she have known? So that was kind of amazing. I wonder if it still says that part if someone else is watching the movie. It is still hard to believe that the movie was really talking about ME. But there it was! Plain as day.

It is kind of like how the movie ""Three Men and a Baby"" can creep you out when you see the ghost of the little boy in the window who was killed in that building earlier. It is scary but I like to see movies with this sort of thing. Mainly because I like getting in touch with alternate energies, channeling my life force, focusing my spiritual center, and developing my psychic powers. These things are very important to me as a professional psychic.

Excellent movie. Recommended. 5 Stars.",1139184000,2,2018,4.274869109947644

624626,4,6303212395,"I love reading books even as a child.  So when this movie came out in 1985, I could relate immediately to the main character, Bastian.

Who could ever forget Falkor, the dog-faced luck dragon, and Atreyu the warrior?  Plus the beautiful Childlike Empress (boy! I really had a crush on her.  Hey... I was 10 years old then).

My favorite part in the movie was when Gmork (the evil wolf) faced Atreyu near the end part.  I even memorized the lines of Gmork, how about that?

I was really glad that my order came before Christmas time.  I bought the DVD to show it to my daughters so they could appreciate the beauty of quality movies for kids then.  They loved it more than those CGI-generated movies nowadays.

This DVD is actually two versions of the film.  Full screen and widescreen versions presented individually in a double-sided DVD.  Frankly, I was surprised that it didn't come in a dual-layered DVD instead.  It would have been better, cuz then you'll just take care of one side of the disc instead of both sides.

My only disappointment is the case it came in (snapper case).  I'd rather have it in a normal DVD case.  You can't protect the double-sided DVD in this lousy snapper case.  That's why my rating is only 4 stars instead of 5 because of this.",1137369600,3,1263,4.493392070484582
624627,5,6303212395,"As a huge fan of fantasy/adventure books and films, I am very particular about the way a fantasy is conveyed. The key to a good fantasy is making it incredible without rendering it unbelievable, and that is what The Neverending Story acheived. Before there was The Lord of The Rings, before Harry Potter, there was The Neverending Story, and it is still the most beautiful of all fantasy tales. It has the ability not only to transport small children to a world of imagination, but to transport teenagers and adults back into their early childhoods.

There is so much to be said for The Neverending Story. Memorable, beautiful characters like The Childlike Empress and Engywook, and Falkor, everyone's favorite furry dragon. The beautiful scenes are also a credit, for who can forget little Bastian in the dingy bookstore, laying eyes on the book with the Auryn symbol on the front for the very first time? Who can fail to love the terrifying but wonderful journey of Atreyu through the land of Fantasia, and what can ever replace the memory of the first time we witnessed Bastian screaming the Empress' name?

Not to mention the special effects were superb for the time and invoke a feeling of nostalgia and awe even today, though they are years out-dated.

For anyone who has seen this movie, I need not recommend it to you...you know its merit. But to those who missed this classic work of art, and to young children who are captivated by Narnia, Middle Earth, and the world beyond Platform 9 3/4...Fantasia is one more world you must escape to...you will love what you find there.",1137369600,2,1584,4.752727272727273

624629,4,6303212395,"I have to smirk at the fact that most adults who talk about this movie always fall back on the fail-safe, ""This is a great movie for kids."" as if admitting that they still enjoy this movie as an adult would be almost taboo. This movie first came out when I was a junior in high school (1983/84) and I am still as entranced with it today (at age 38) as much as I ever was back then. A more accurate comment for this wonderfully imaginative feature is, ""This is a movie for all ages!""

Unlike most fantasy flicks today which rely on miles of film stock dedicated to top-of-the-line CGI effects to hold your interest, The Neverending Story relies on just that, THE STORY. Even today with it's outdated blue-screen F/X and brilliantly colored 80s electronic/orchestral fantasy music (which I will forever be addicted to), this movie is one of the rare exceptions that still stands the test of time and draws you in to an enchanting world of both intensity with it's sometimes more adult-esque themes and situations like the Swamp of Sadness and G'Mork's twitching paw as he dies as well as the more abundant classic light-hearted feelings of youth and innocence (flying with Falkor will do it every time).

Sadly, this first-half, movie adaptation of the book was the only noble and serious attempt at recreating the world that Michael Ende so thoughtfully created and The Neverending Story successfully stands on it's own as a complete story. But, after that it's all downhill from there. If you have fallen in love with the first movie, don't even bother watching the sequels.

To today's standards the special effects aren't much, but to me the overall story is great.  The movie is scary for young children and, being older, It is actualy depressing, but it redeems itself in the end.  Of course movies are different than books most of the time, since they are adaptions.  The story is neverending because it can be watched again and the book can be read again and again and again.

The boy reading is actually important to what he's reading about, sort of the flipside of what we accept as reality.  Bastian (Barret Oliver) skips class after arriving too late for a math test, and spends the time reading The NeverEnding Story, about the fantastic characters of Fantasia, which is slowly succumbing to ""nothingness.""

In the story, which is almost like another film within the film, plains warrior Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) is sent on a quest to stop the nothingness.  His adventures are as entertaining - with imaginative and often poignant action - as almost any fantasy movie like Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter, though with twenty-year older special effects.

My biggest complaint is how abruptly it ended.  I felt it needed at least another few minutes to resolve some things in Bastian's life.

  This was done before all the extreme animation came in.  Noah did his own stunts as well.
  The most asked question is: What is the name Bastion yelled out?
  The part that touched me the most was when the Rock Biter told of how weak he really was, even though he looked strong.  We are all like that, no matter what happens in our lives.  As many times as I've watched this movie, I always tear up at this part.
  The color and photography are SO wonderful.
  I will be 59 in a week and I can't see myself EVER tiring of it.  People can wax poetic about acting and directing, but this movie must just been seen for itself!
  I have felt for years that children are having their imaginations taken away from them by the tv.  We need to read more books.  I taught myself to read at 3, and it was a good thing, as in my day they didn't do anything about dyslexic children in Catholic schools.  I still read mainly fantasy all the time, and I write as well.  I hope there will never come a day when I can't give the childlike princess a new name!!!

The film/novel is better known in the U.S. with its English title of ""The Neverending Story"".  It was also the first film that Wolfgang Petersen filmed in English.  The story begins with a troubled boy named Bastian (Barret Oliver), who is being raised by his father (Gerald McRaney).

Mr. Koreander seemingly doesn't want to sell the book to him, but Bastian manages to run from the store with book in hand.  Bastian takes the book to school with him, where he is tormented by three bullies (Drum Garrett, Darryl Cooksey & Nicholas Gilbert).  To avoid the bullies, Bastian finds refuge in a rarely-used attic within the school and begins to read from the book about a magical land called Fantasia.  Fantasia is a wonderful place with many unusual characters and is ruled by the Childlike Princess (Tami Stronach), but something terrible is happening to Fantasia as parts of it are disappearing by an unknown force referred to only as ""the nothing"".  The Childlike Princess calls upon the strongest warrior to find a human child to stop ""the nothing"".  The warrior, a boy named Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) of a tribe similar to Native Americans, takes the protective signet that the Childlike Princess gives to him and sets off to find a human child, which can only be found beyond the bounds of Fantasia.  To his astonishment, as Bastian reads the book and the many adventures, challenges and dangers and Atreyu faces, Bastian slowly begins to realize whom Atreyu and the Childlike Princess are actually seeking.

With imaginative characters, good cinematography & special effects and an endearing & well-written story, ""The Neverending Story"" is a wonderful and engaging film that not only captures Bastian's imagination in the story, but the audience's imagination as well.  Other memorable characters in the film include Teeny Weeny (Deep Roy), Night Hob (Tilo Prckner), Cairon (Moses Gunn), Engywook (Sydney Bromley), Urgl (Patricia Hayes), Falkor (voice of Alan Oppenheimer), Rock Biter, the Racing Snail and the Bat. Overall, I rate ""The Neverending Story"" with 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it to both young & old alike.  It's a wonderful film that can be watched time and again without becoming tiresome.  Sadly, the film's two sequels (produced in 1990 & 1994) were far less memorable.  Other films directed by Wolfgang Petersen include ""Das Boot"" (1981), ""Enemy Mine"" (1985), ""The Perfect Storm"" (2000) and ""Troy"" (2004).",1098748800,247,2767,5.115555555555556

In today's world, children need a message a little deeper than: ""Wish and it will come true"".  The ultimate irony of the film though is the fact that it has been outfoxed by a video game version known as ""Final Fantasy Tactics Advance"". In that game Sebastian's wishing turns on him creating a fictional world where he becomes a tyrant and no one grows emotionally. This irony is compounded because the bookstore owner in the film warns the audience against the ""shallowness"" of video games.",1098403200,2,617,4.866666666666666

624777,5,6303212395,"Sir Adam got it almost right!  Good review, by the way.
This is an awesome story about the importance of the story.  Yes, the moral lesson of ""The Neverending Story"" is the importance of the story itself (and by extension the importance of human imagination).  If one has read some of Joseph Campbell's ""The Power of Myth"" one understands this completely.  It is that Native American idea of ""he who does not have the stories has nothing.""
The key force of destruction in this tale is ""the Nothing"" literally non-existence or the lack of imagination.  The world in which ""The Neverending Story"" takes place, Fantasia, is a conglomerate universe composed of the dreams and hopes of all people.  Every story ever told and every character who has ever lived exists somewhere in Fantasia.  So that somewhere in Fantasia, Paul Atreides wanders a desert landscape while somewhere else in Fantasia Alice falls down the rabbit hole.
Fantasia, this conglomerate world of human dreams, is dying.  The reason is that people in the real world no longer dream... of anything.  It is a very modern tale about the death of the human capacity to, as John Lennon put it, IMAGINE.  Without the capability to imagine anything, people become easily manipulated by forces greater than them... this is where the real villain comes in (more about that after the next paragraph).
The main protagonist, Atreyu, is the alter ego of the real life boy who is reading the story.  The real life boy, therefore, is filled with imagination, brimming with it, in fact.  He exists in a real world where nobody imagines anything anymore.  Therefore, the alter ego (in Fantasia) of the real life boy with imagination is a young champion who is trying to save imagination itself and its conglomerate world, Fantasia.
The real villain of the story is, at least from a Christian context, Lucifer, or the Devil himself.  He is the ""force behind the Nothing"" who is attempting the death of all imagination.  This explains the creature known as the Morg.  As Sir Adam mentioned in his review, this is the major adversary for Atreyu (and the real life boy who is his generator).  The Morg is, in his own words, ""a servant of the force behind the Nothing.""  The Morg is, I believe, a demon, or fallen angel servant who has somehow crossed the border into Fantasia and put on the guise of that mythical creature of destruction, the werewolf.  The Wolf image is only a guise used by the demon to try to blend in with his surroundings.
Of course, we know who wins in the end.  This is a very complex movie and a VERY relevant one to the times in which we are living.  I see people around me who are quite literally mental cripples who are incapable of imagination.  Without the stories, we are nothing.",1090108800,4,2755,4.695833333333334

However, because I can see that kids would love it, I think it still holds up well. Heck, I still like it.
I wish this DVD had more special features, but alas it does not. What really bothered me was that it didn't have a subtitle for when Bastian shouts out a name for the Child-like Empress. I was so looking forward to finally finding out what the heck he shouts out for her name, and I get nothing. But I researched it on the net, and apparently it's ""Moon Child."" It does sound like that's what he's shouting. But I'm baffled that that was his mother's name (unless he changed his mind further into the film and decided to give the Empress a random name rather than his mother's).
So overall, the movie's good and the DVD is so-so. Great picture and sound quality, but no special features and no subtitle for when he shouts out the Empress' new name. But it's the only one in the series worth buying I think. Well, maybe the second one was ok.",1089072000,5,1126,4.099547511312217

Looking at this film through older, more cynical, world-weary eyes, it's easy to discount it and point out its many faults.  YES, the acting is unbearable at times.  YES, the last twenty minutes are overly preachy.  And YES the narrative progresses aimlessly with no rhyme or reason.  But you know what?  I don't care.  I even found myself getting teary-eyed at some points, something I rarely do.
I agree with the other reviewers.  If you didn't see and love this film as a kid, you won't enjoy it now.

It's about imagination disappearing, and people forgetting to dream and remember what it was like to be a kid.
Nevertheless, it is a good movie.  The wolf might scare the kids, I remember it being rather spooky when I saw it at the age of 8.

Because it has none.  Big disappointment.  Where is the cast and crew?  Why didn't the director put in some time with this movie and give us a commentary, or behind the scenes, or even cut scenes?  Wasn't this a classic. . . ?  As far as I know the director hasn't been up to too much lately.

On the other hand, as the age was young, had the eyes that could feel fantasy stories purely, that is, had the pure mind that could feel what bravery or challenging etc was wonderful thing.
When I was a adult now, having such a thinking is difficult, that is, when think about [bravery or challenging], in mind needless thinkings are added, resignation, fear, uneasy etc..
I was happy that can watch this film when was child.
Recently I watched the film on TV aggain after an interval of twenty years. But even if I am a adult, the moving mind remained, I was moved very much again as I was a boy. For instance when the horse sinked into a marsh, I that was child cried, and when I watched the scene again on TV, I have the emotion of the sorrow.
when we get to be adults, in many meaning we lose the mind that we had in children age, for instance, passion, trial, tenderness etc. Because we are followed by time, money, benefit etc, tend to forget such important things.

624831,2,6303212395,"The Neverending Story (Wolfgang Petersen, 1984)
All we in America knew of Wolfgang Petersen in 1984 was Das Boot. How were we to know that it was completely out of character? His followup, The Neverending Story (and a smattering of films since, e.g. In the Line of Fire) have shown that Petersen has a far more absurd air than the brilliant, but relentlessly depressing, Das Boot would have us believe.
The Neverending Story takes that sense of the absurd to its logical conclusion. Thankfully, Petersen had snapped back to something resembling reality by the time he made the film after this, 1985's Enemy Mine. But for The Neverending Story, Petersen pretty much cut himself loose from anything anchoring him to the earth and took off in a flight of fantasy that is, at the very least, a little disturbing.
Someone wiser than I once said of such films that ""if you see them when you're eight years old, they'll be great forever, but if you see them for the first time in high school or older, you just don't get it."" (Thus, the continuing popularity of The Goonies has finally been explained.) I was in high school when The Neverending Story came out, so I guess my reaction wasn't much of a surprise. It was fun for what it was, though readers of Michael Ende's novel are likely to feel cheated and those with even a shred of subtlety are going to be beating themselves over the head for the movie's final twenty minutes.
Barret Oliver (D. A. R. Y. L., Frankenweenie) stars as Bastian, who spends his time getting picked on in school and listening to his father (Gerald McRaney, years away from Major Dad fame) talk about how awful it is to have an imagination. While running from the school bullies, he stumbles into a bookshop owned by a rather odd chap named Koreander (Thomas Hill, who played the president in The Nude Bomb, the Get Smart movie). He secures a book from Koreander whose plot is, in essence, the rest of the film (save the merciless moralizing at the end).
Despite said merciless moralizing, some of the things the beginning of the film imparts to the viewer are that it's okay to steal stuff from stores as long as you leave a note saying you're going to give it back, it's okay to cut school as long as you have something better to do, and that no matter how long you stay away, no one will come looking for you. (Is it a spoiler to say part of the end's moral is that these actions have no consequences?)
I'm sure those who were slightly younger when this came out have a decidedly different take on it, but take the advice of my ever-so-wise friend. If you haven't already seen it, you're going to sit there at the end wondering what all the fuss was about. **",1075766400,6,2686,4.494887525562373

624860,2,6303212395,"The quick and dirty is: don't believe the gushing hype from the other reviewers, there are many better fantasy movies and this one isn't worth the time.
The NeverEnding Story, while a unique creation, is little more than a thin and flimsy canvas stretched upon a tired rack.  The basic story should be familiar - lonely withdrawn youth finds refuge from worldly troubles in a fantasy book, and through the adventures of the main character grows more confident and whole.  All the necessities are there, including a central internal conflict that must be reconciled (the death of his mother), a handful of bullies that in the end get their comeuppence, a wide array of superficially unique creatures, obscure magic forces, a quest to save the world.  The problem is that everything is so poorly thought out that the movie becomes an inscrutable connection of disjoint and unsatisfying moments.
a key element to any fantasy is the degree to which its conceiver has thoroughly thought out his/her conception.  the grand daddy of them all, tolkein, did an unbelievable amount of behind the scenes 'research' for middle earth, so much so that readers can bore themselves to death pouring through obscure appendicies on the origin of hobbit pipe weed and other trivial and irrelevent details.  the upshot of this is that everything is tied together and every creature and race draws upon a complex history, which gives the story itself a tremendous amount of death.  nothing in the the middle earth books is simply there; everything is there for a reason, and everything was somewhere else and did other things before it came to be there.
In the NeverEnding Story (NES from now on) nothing has a reason beyond its surface, and the writing to connect the dots of the plot is terrible.  our hero, atreus, is summoned before a motley and completely arbitrary collection of 30 or 40 strange individuals who appear to form some sort of world congress.  the language of the scene and the acting of the characters is tremendously unconvincing, and it reminded me of the initial meeting between flash gordon and his crew and ming the merciless.  flash was a terrible movie, but it was supposed to be terrible and campy, while NES seems to be someone's best efforts at a child's tale.  after some verbal sparring atreus is given one inexplicable piece of advice (""you must go alone, and you must go without weapons"")and heads off on his quest.  He travels from short, absurd vignette to short absurd vignette, buoyed by an enormous amount of deux ex machina, the greatest portion of which is supplied by the funny looking flying dog (a 'luck' dragon) from the movie trailers.  to give you a sense of the inanity of the plot devices, the dragon saves the boy from a wolf and carries him while he sleeps 9,900 miles towards the next plot point.  when the boy wakes up, for some reason he has to walk the last 100 miles, but at least it only takes him a couple minutes.
On the bright side, The NeverEnding Story is a unique creation, full of vast lanscapes and strange creatures, and it does have a good message.  i was disappointed with the creatures.  while most are unusual, they are generally either the wrong size of present some sort of contradiction.  for example, we see an enormous giant (the presentation of scale is effective) and later on an enormous turtle.  we see an enourmous snail that (surprise!) travels very quickly, an enormous flying dog, and some very small people who are helpful.  nothing has any depth, and (sorry if i sound like a broken record) the lack of substance leaves one hollow.  whoever was in charge of the musical score goes way overboard by way of compensation; the excruciating orchestral backdrops (with the exception of the title song is appropriately simple and joyful) ooze so much heavy feeling that you'll be smearing the emotive goo out of your ears with an oar.
an outstanding alternative to this movie is ""the dark crystal"", created by jim henson of moppet fame.  it is extremely well thought out, well acted and well written.  all the characters have a history and all interact with the world as if they really belong within it, as opposed to the pasted on characters of NES.  this grounding gives the story a strong foundation on which to build, enabling the culmination of the dark crystal to resonate with meaning.",1065571200,5,4349,4.778371161548732

I still have the old VHS tape that I have to have half-worn out by now, but ""The Never-Ending Story"" is still as entrancing and as luminous as it was when I was four years old.  The film focuses on the paralell journies of of Sebastian, a shy and reclusive child in a modern-day metropolis who steals a book from a library while being chased by local bullies.  Once safe in a old dingy attic, he begins reading of a fantastic land called Fantasia, a world made from the hopes and dreams of every human.  In this story (Called the ""Never-Ending Story"") as young human boy named Atreyu is called on by the dying Empress of Fantasia to find a way to stop the Nothing.  The nothing is best described as a dense, pitch-black cloud but it represents far more.  It destroys anything in Fantasia it comes in contact with the broken hopes, dreams and spirits of human beings.  Atreyu is sent on this mission to stop it before all of Fantasia is destroyed.
Sebastian follows his quest, as do we.  And what we see are incredible visual effects, utilizing artful production design, make-up and convincing puppet-work that makes memorable and instantly connectable fairy-tale characters.  For one there is the huge flying dog that Atreyu befriends, a giant being made from rock, the minature professor and his wife and especially that menacing black wolf who aids the nothing.  Even though I have discovered other unnerving and disturbing movie villians over the years (Hannibal Lector, Michael Myers) that wolf, named Gemork, is still one of the most menacing and frightening characters I have ever seen put to the screen.  Gemork may have only a few minutes total of time on the screen, but he is still makes an impact with a low, growly tone and an indifference to anything in Fantasia that  gets destroyed.
And ample credit must be given to director Wolfgang Peterson, who until ""The Never-Ending Story"" was internationally known for his WWll submarine drama ""Das Boot,"" and some people were very surprised to learn that his first english languange film was a childrens' fantasy.  But Mr. Peterson knew what he was doing.  That same keen sense of character, pace and story that he has brought to films like ""Das boot,"" and ""In the Line of Fire"" is still very evident here.  He uses the stunning visuals to full effect and fleshes out the theme-filled story well.  No wonder I remember this film so well from my childhood...",1065139200,2,2458,4.721311475409836

Non-fans of the movie easily put down the villain""the nothing"", but the nothing has many possible important symbolic meanings. For some it may mean the coming of Nuclear war wiping out civilization as we know it. For me, the nothing was deforestation and the greedy killing of our Ecosystem.

624950,5,6303212395,"After watching the movie one can tell that it was a plot to convince america that we are turning into televised slobs and seem to be abandoning the rich and fluid world of the imagination and books.  Most of the time these little gags fall flat on their faces.  However with Neverending Story it is truely one of a kind in the relm that it has a strong message, and a touching story that one can't help but love.
The Neveredning Story starts off with the young boy Bastian who is constantly tormented by a group of bullies.  One day as he is running away from them he hides inside of a dusty old book store where he meets an ecentric old book keeper.  The old man doesn't like bastian because Bastian is part of the TV era.  However Bastian likes to read books.  The old man turns his back for a moment and bastian borrows the book the old man was reading the Neverending story.  At that point Bastian hides out in the school storage room where he starts to read the book.  The story he reads (and of course we witness) is the story of an evil force known as the Nothingis slowly destroying the world of Fantasia.  It is up to a young warrior known as Atreu who must journey through out Fantasia and find a way to destroy the Nothing.  Along the way he meets up with Falcore the Luck Dragon, the Rock Biter, and an assortment of many other characters in the attemp to save Fantasia.  In the End Atreu and BAstian have more in common than they think and it falls into Bastians hands to save Fantasia (the childs imagination).
This heart warming and truely awsome tale is one of the best in the field of Fantasy.  It is truely a one of a kind and the sequels and remake only taint this wonderful classic.  It also leaves a strong message that while TV is fun for a while, the human imagination (helped along by reading novels) is truely the greatest thing available.",1043280000,5,1864,4.306590257879656
624951,5,6303212395,"I have always said ""They just don't make movies like this anymore"" and it's true.  It is not entirely consistent with the book and it does leave off at a point from which the sadly lacking sequel picks up, but it's an amazing film.  The creatures, the characters and the story are all wonderful and breathtaking.  They really just do NOT make them like this anymore.  This has been my all-time favorite movie since it first came out when I was about ten.
Being a movie and being limited to a certain time span, they could not include all of the deep intricacies of the book which I have bought four or five times and read at least five times.  One of the few other stories I can compare this with is ""The Little Prince"".  Children will find it delightful--that goes without saying--but only someone who has aged in years and otherwise is likely to appreciate the profound lessons behind the story.  The same goes also with ""The Little Prince"".
If you're like me, you may also comprehend this story (although, more so, the book) to a degree which is actually almost depressing.  Sometimes, the harsh truth about reality can only be best conveyed through fantasy and make-believe.
The NeverEnding Story seems to boil down to the matter of how youth and innocence is taken from you as you grow older.  In the book, the Gmork, who served under the Nothing, told Atreyu that the only way he could cross over the border from Fantasia (""Fantastica"" in the book), was to become a ""lie"" that children tell and that no one would believe.  It's an amazing analogy for all that is special and pure about being young that is forsaken when you get older.

The movie runs (with a bit less creatures than the book) following faithfully the path that Michael Ende wrote. It ends just at the middle of the book, just to try not to cut so much from it.
Why did it losses 2 stars? Because the only thing good the dvd has is the movie, the rest of features are just a trailer, some pictures of the movie itself and some written data.

625001,5,6303212395,"This movie's release was unfortunatly overshadowed by the release of E.T., and so many missed out on this incredible movie that is one of the rare movies that actually improves on the original novel (although Micheal Ende would probably disagree).
Bastian is a young boy, still grieving from the death of his mother, struggling in his relationship with his father, suffering from nightmares, and mercilessly bullied by fellow school students. To escape from this unhappy existence, he surrounds himself with books, and one day when escaping the local bullies hides in an old bookshop belonging to the mysterious Mr Koreander. Using the ole' reverse psychology treatment, the old man entices Bastian to run off with a large book, intrigingly titled 'The Neverending Story'. Hiding himself in the school's storage room, Bastian begins to read of the land of Fantasia, which draws him deeper and deeper into it's story as he reads of the young hero Atreyu and his quest to find a cure for the seriously ill Child-Like Empress to stop the mysterious Nothing that is swallowing up the land.
What follows is an incredible journey of adventure, magic, imagination and faith that the two boys face - Atreyu by experiencing them, Bastian by reading them - helped by Falcor the luck dragon, the gnomes Engwok and Urgl and the giant Rock-Biter, and hindered by the ever-growing Nothing and the wolf-like G'Mork. By the conclusion, we not only learn the (rather startling) true natures of both Fantasia and the Nothing, but are left with some pretty important issues to think about such as the importance of the imagination, the need faith in one's self and reinforcing the idea that just one person can make a difference.
A few minor gripes with the story is that the rocky relationship between Bastian and his father is not properly resolved or explored, though it is implied that they eventually reconcile. Also, after the climax in the Ivory Tower, Atreyu unfortunatly drops from the action. True, his role in the story was completed, and the spotlight has to fall on Bastian, but it would have been nice to of had a scene with both Atreyu and Bastian who share their adventure together.
The three children actors are utterly outstanding - Noah Hathaway as the heroic and innocent Atreyu, Barret Oliver as the Bastian who manages to be hopeful and despairing at the same time, and the stunning Tami Stronach as the Child-Like Empress, who never fails to make an impression as Atreyu nervously approaches her in the Ivory Tower. Adult actors back up the child stars nicely, and even the special effect characters such as Falcor, the Rock Biter and Morga come across as real characters, capable of real emotion.
Even though this movie is getting on in years, it undoubtably holds up to today's standards. The many characters such as Falcor, the Racing Snail, the Bat, the Rock Biter and the chilling G'Mork (who still makes me shiver every time he says -
""People who have no hopes or dreams are easy to control"") are flawless. Sets such as the Swamp, the Ivory Tower, Engwok's cave and the Sphinx are also still as fresh as they were on their original release - although they used the same figures for the Southern Oracle as they did for the Sphinx, only changed the color - slack!
Lastly, the soundtrack is beautiful, and the song 'The Neverending Story' is perhaps the best song written for a movie.
My enthusiastic ravings are no doubt due to the fact that this movie featured dominantly in my childhood - it partly helped along my love of books, and remains one of my all-time favourite movies. Hopefully I haven't over-hyped it for you, but it's truely a great film that you don't have to be a kid to enjoy, and can learn more from each time you watch it.

625003,5,6303212395,"""The NeverEnding Story"" is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. I was first mesmerized by this movie when it came out in 1984, and all of these years later I am still completely glued to the screen when I watch it.
When Bastian is tricked into borrowing a particular book, he opts to skip school and read it in the attic. The book, as it turns out, involves him in more ways than one. It is a story about Fantasia, a world that is succumbing to The Nothing. The Childlike Empress, who is also ill, sends for Fantasia's best hero, Atreyu, to find a way to stop the Nothing. Along the way, he meets a luckdragon name Falcor, and together they bring Fantasia's salvation back to the Childlike Empress.
The casting of Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), Bastian (Barret Oliver), and the Childlike Empress (Tami Stronach) was outstanding. The emotions that these three displayed in the movie was nothing short of perfection, ranging the guantlet from estatic, to sad, to fearful, etc. They are the very reasons that you will get wrapped up in this movie.
It is interesting to note that, for some reason, these three did not enjoy huge success after the movie. Granted, ""The NeverEnding Story"" was not a box office success, but there was raw talent in them waiting to be unleashed. Noah Hathway disappeared from in front of the screen in 1986, made one movie in 1992, and disappeared again until showing up behind the scenes in two movies in 1999 and one in 2001. Barret Oliver starred in several movies (best known is D.A.R.Y.L in 1985) and made many TV guest appearences until 1989, when he disappeared from the screen. And Tami Stronach was introduced to movie goers in this movie, but never made another movie after it.

There are some delightfully scary moments, not least the horrifically real-looking wolf that tails Atreyu throughout his quest.

Since it's release on DVD, it has to be THE best flick of all-time.  For the most part, the premise is simple; it deals with the beautiful world of Fantasia and a boy named Bastien.  Many refer to this as ""The Ultimate Fantasy Movie"" and I most certainly agree to that claim.  This is indeed a movie where you can escape from reality and just let your thoughts go wild.  Nothing seems impossible in the world of Fantasia.  All of the characters would make great additions to ones 'circle of association.'  Who wouldn't want The Rock Bitter or Atreyu as friends, or even Falcor as a pet??  Just think about the possibilities!!  The DVD though, is a nice piece to any collection.  The disc is double-sided and contains a full-screen as well as a wide-screen verion, both of which are spectacular.  The theatrical trailer is a nice addition, and something I was quite happy to see.  Even the little tidbits of info about the movie and story are a nice touch.  This is most certainly a movie that anyone, either young, or younger (basically young or old) can enjoy alone, or even together.  It is, and will be a timeless classic for many years to come.  If you haven't seen the movie, you are definitely missing out on something.  If you have seen it, watch it again, and just let you mind soar, because like in Fantasia, imagination has no boundries....",1021334400,,1622,4.4965753424657535
625071,5,6303212395,"I thought this movie was absolutly amazing...I am an 80's child that grew up on that film...But I have one simple problem with the whole thing...How come in every single review I have read simply hasn't mentioned the evil doer in the film...no one seems to know of his name, or the purpose of his character...The Gamalk...He wasn't a mean wolf or just the bad guy...He is the representation of all of the hopes and dreams of ""the people"" that were forgotten.  He was the ""void"" of all that ""people"" wanted and wished for...And I think that his character deserves a little more respect than we have given him...There cant be Fantasy without reality...And I think that the Gamalk was the link between the two as well as Bastian, I sort of view the Gamalk as a part of Bastian as well, Atreyu was the good part of him and the Gamalk was the evil part of him...Does anyone agree with me???",1021334400,2,885,4.462962962962963
625072,5,6303212395,"This is one of those movies that should be included in lists of things you must have watched to be an 80's child. Almost everyone I know has seen it, and even people who claim to be too old to be interested, or just simply not interested, in the sci-fi/fantasy genre admit that they love it.
Many, many years after watching it for the first time, I picked up a copy of the DVD, and realized that the movie was still fresh in my mind. The scenes, and even some of Sebastian's expressions, immediately identified themselves in memory as I watched the movie again. This doesn't happen very often with me and it must be an indication of the impact of the movie.
This is a great movie and a definite must-see. Even after all these years, it's still an awesome movie. Being a fan of this genre of movie, I may be a little biased in my opinion, but as I mentioned above, you don't have to be a fan to thoroughly enjoy it.",1020124800,,914,4.228571428571429

The best thing about this movie has to be the story and the music.  The story is very unique, I haven't read the book but this movie would make anyone rush out and buy it.  The sound, oooh, the music is killer its some of the best music you will probably ever hear (At least from fantasy movies made in the 80's, some of which will make you shudder in disgust).

I am normally not a science-fiction person, but the theatrical special effects in this movie are so well-constructed and implemented that I am always entraced by this particular release.
Essentially, a lonely boy faces a humdrum existence until he gets a hold of a magical book and discovers the amazing story inside--and his role as an active participant in at least saving the Empress from the clutches of the nothing. Again, what microscopic holes do exist (how the Empress and the boy are standing in the end if Nothing really has decimated all but one grain of sand in her world) are overshadowed by the vastly superior bulk of the film.",1018051200,3,758,4.793893129770993
625115,3,6303212395,"This movie is great for younger children. The plot is relatively simple and imaginative, and the inhabitants of Fantasia (the boundless country depicted in the story) are kid-friendly and enjoyable. I'm not so sure it would have much impact at all on a teenager or adult, though. I, like many people, sawe this when I was in elementary school, and I used to rent it all the time. Recently I found the DVD version and decided it would be fun to revisit the movie.
So here's the pressing question: is this movie worth revistiting when you're older? The end is. Tami Stronach did an EXCELLENT job as the Empress- I almost cried. Noah Hathaway is pretty good too, playing Atreyu, the brave warrior. Plus, the music is good. Nothing like a good instrumental score... but I don't think it quite lived up to the extreme excitement I felt right before watching it.
One last note: before you watch the movie, watch the Theatrical Trailer- which is really the only special feature on the DVD. The trailer does a better job of creating excitement and organizing scenes than the actual movie. I always thought the movie wasn't detailed enough; for example, they would say something like ""Atreyu traveled far and wide to find the cure for the Empress"" and they would show Atreyu galloping through the desert, but no more detail. They were, however, amazingly focused on his scene with the really slow turtle.
In short: you might enjoy it, you might not. It's entirely a matter of your taste in movies.",1017878400,2,1488,4.704980842911877
625116,5,6303212395,"I first saw this movie as a young child. It continued to be one of my favorites all my life. Since first seeing this movie, I have been exposed to countless thousands of movies, everything from Kurosawa to Orson Welles and John Ford. But Fantasy and Sci-Fi have always been my favorite kind of movies. Amazingly, rather than degrade with time, this movie just gets better and better. Why? Well first of all, the plot is the often used but always great story of a boy on a quest to save the world. It worked in Star Wars, it worked in Dune, it worked in every Final Fantasy game, and it works here. Secondly, the visuals are some of the best seem in any movie ever. Don't see this movie of VHS. It MUST be experienced on DVD in all its wide-screen glory. The special effects are perfect (taken right from the 80s golden age of matte paintings and blue screen before CGI destroyed the artistry of visuals). The soundtrack is one of the best in any movie ever. In short, this is in my opinion, the best movie Wolfgang Peterson ever made, and one of the greatest fantasy flicks of all time. Movies come and go, but this story remains...neverending. It is my favorite movie of all time.

In my opinion, The Neverending Story is the greatest fantasy movie ever made. When it was made it was the most expensive movie ever made outside of the United States. It was also a box office flop. But like The Wizard of Oz, It's a Wonderful Life, and several modern films I could name, real genius is just a bit much for some people to take ahead of its time and all at once. There has been a lot of discussion about the book vs. the movie, and while I'm not usually a fan of modifying books heavily for the big-screen adaptation, in this case I absolutely have to make an exception. You see the thing is, while I love the movie, I don't really like the book. Michael Ende may have been right about one thing when he tried to sue the film-makers for deviating from his book: this movie is not the book in film form, it's something else entirely. There are concepts that work in books, but just don't translate to an audio/visual medium very well. I LIKE the Nothing as storm rather than as a silent consuming force. I LIKE the gate to the Southern Oracle being lethal rather than paralyzing.  The simplification and streamlining/reworking of the story to what the movie became was the RIGHT decision to make, much as it may irk purists and fans of the book. The only other movie I can think of where I approve so much of slaughtering a book's vision is The Secret of NIMH (it was actually Don Bluth's comments about what works and doesn't work in a film vs. a book in the commentary of that film that made me realize I feel The Neverending Story is SUPERIOR to the book because of the changes made). For better or worse, whether you like the deviations of the story from the book or not, the film was made the way it was. Personally I absolutely love it.

""Not Atreyu the child, Atreyu the Warrior!""

The emotional core of the film, the protagonist inside of the book, Atreyu, is the stuff of legend. Here we have a British actor playing a Native American archetype, a child actor playing a child warrior. When you're a kid watching this movie for the first time you never question or think about such things even for a second, and as an adult, you might like me feel amazed by the alternating extreme vulnerability and confident strength brought to the character. You have to empathize with the character, even see yourself in him as a child, while at the same time seeing that good old-fashioned hero pluck that makes you love Luke Skywalker. I really do think it's one of the great child-actor performances of all time, simply because he's not some muscle-bound action hero. He's a kid. And he's got to save the world. And you never question it for a moment. You believe it. Awesome. In an old interview I found on the net the child-actor said of the character he played ""I AM Atreyu."" I agree.

""Bastian, please! Save us!""

The child who plays Bastian, and the child who plays the Empress both similarly surpass themselves in playing very serious demanding roles with incredibly sincerity and believability. While Bastian plays his character the most like a normal, shy, introverted child (you can really feel his childishness and immaturity at the end of the movie when he has to choose between trying to act and live the way everyone else insists that he should (like an adult!), and doing what he really wants to in order to save an entire world). The Empress impresses despite her very short screen time by managing quite quickly to convince you despite a very young age, that she at once gravely ill, very old, and (as my dear sister Codemaster Talon put it) actually Empress of something! That super-calm serenity, deep sadness, and knowing smile (I absolutely love the look she gives Atreyu when he says he's failed [but she knows better], and the smile she starts to show when Atreyu asks why Bastian doesn't do something if he knows how to save them). Codemaster Talon also said that ""Never before was so much heavy lifting required by so many child actors."" And I'll add that never before was it been lifted so far and so well.

""I never knew it was THAT beautiful.""

It's fascinates me how the use of wide-screen, wide-angle camera-work results not in a kiddie-feeling movie, but in in adult, epic, emotionally powerful film. And more than that, the artwork results in mesmerizing landscapes that just have to be seen wide-screen to be believed (there is nothing like the feeling the first time you see the Ivory Tower). When Atreyu sets off on his quest and you see him ride past massive crystals and past screen-filling rainbows, over dunes and through grassy plains, you feel the distance and get swept up in the grandeur of the world that has been created.

Visually this film is stunning. The painted backgrounds and wide angle shots are some of the best in any film ever made, and they combine with the music to make this one of the most beautiful films in history. The special effects are obviously reference quality, on the level of Star Wars. They aren't CGI cartoons and digitally re-touched pictures. The effects in this movie come from great craftsmanship in the old-school tradition. Miniatures, puppetry, painted backgrounds, and brilliant set design combine with amazing voice-acting, and spectacular cinematography to create a wold that is more than just fantastic, it's believable, and makes you feel that it is all REAL.

The music of this movie has been debated for some time now. It seems to be very popular these days to equate ""original cut"" with ""superior film"", even if it is not necessarily the case. I don't speak German. I haven't seen the original theatrical version of this film, nor have I heard the complete original score. But I do know this: some of the most memorable music in the film came from the International version we've all seen. The theme for the Ivory Tower is one of the coolest pieces of music in film history, and it was NOT composed for the film by it's original composer. Say what you will, that's a cool piece of music that I for one am GLAD is in the movie. Regardless of re-edits and cuts and new music, the score to this film is one of the best and most memorable in movie history, and it's a sad thing indeed that the COMPLETE music for this film has never been, and possibly never will be made available. What music is playing on my computer speakers and on my MP3 players all the time. Not just good. Fantastic.

I really think that this is Wolfgang Peterson's best film. I've seen a few in my time, and while some of them were pretty good, none of the ones I saw ever came close to the magic of this film. I think it was made at the zenith of his talent and ability, as was Miyazaki's Nausicaa and George Lucas' Star Wars. You can feel the idealism and courage in this film, it permeates everything.

""Never give up, and good luck will find you.""

Throughout my life I've seen this film as a metaphor for my own life experiences, and that's because it perfectly captures the hero's quest mythology that I love so much. I can't imagine a more frightening test than the Sphinx Gate to the Southern Oracle (whose burning eyes can see straight into your heart and fry you to a crisp in an instant from a hundred feet in the air). I can't imagine a more perfect metaphor for losing your faith in life and having it restored than drowning in the swamps of sadness only to have your life saved by a light in the sky that heralds your rescue by a Luck Dragon. And just when you think it's all over and you've completely failed, you may be surprised to know that making the journey was a victory in itself, and you always had the ability to save what's most important to you, you just had to believe it with all your heart and do something about it.

With the world so full of cynicism and practicality rubbish, it feels so good to put this movie in and be reminded just for a little while that stories and dreams are, after all, far more important than silly things like reality and a world filled with hatred and despair.

If you think this movie is over-rated, you may need to see it properly. It's a three star movie on a tiny TV, a four star movie wide-screen, and a five star movie on a projector with the volume cranked way up (especially since the volume on the disc is a little low). There are a few movies that I really wish I could see in a movie theater just once. I would pay $50.00 to see this film in a theater. No joke. I hope and pray that this film will one day get the remastered in high-definition, DTS, full-making of documentary, and feature length commentary with all the actors and director on a super-special edition DVD (I doubt the German version will ever be available but it sure would be nice to include it). Until then the U.S. release of this film on DVD has good sound and picture and allows everyone to enjoy a wide-screen clear transfer of this, the best fantasy film I've ever seen, and my personal favorite movie ever.",1017705600,3,10102,4.479630635524171

625118,5,6303212395,"I had loved this movie since I was a kid and I had to get it on DVD. This movie is spectacular! Above anything else it teaches children what a wonderful gift of reading can do for the imagination and how important reading is. The story takes us through an oridinary world of Bastian, who's having trouble in life with the recent death of his mother. And his father who wants him to put both feet on the ground and stop living in the clouds. However, when Bastian is being chased by bully's from school he finds a bookstore that has a rather thick but interesting cover. The bookstores owner warns him its not your typical book and that he couldn't have it. However, he steals it and then finds himself in the school's attick. He finds himself soon lost in an adventure of The Neverending Story. Which the book is about a land being destroyed by The Nothing. As Sabastian is being led on the adventure following another young boy in hopes to save Fantasia and it's people, named Atrial. When all along it's only Bastian who can save them.
This movie has everything you could possibly want in a fantisy. It's full of adventure, special effects, and all through a little boy that is using his adventure through a not so ordinary book. This show's how important again it is for kids to read, and to use their imaginations, and what books can do to take you on a realistic adventure. It's amazing and I call it a classic as well as millions of other fan's across the world.
The DVD is pretty good, the sound seemed a bit faded but its a pretty good DVD. Only thing is it doesn't give you the opition to have it full screen like some of them do. However, it's got Notes and Trivia on the book and characters, interactive menus, theatrical trailer, and language selections.

625119,5,6303212395,"It came as quite a shock to American critics when Wolfgang Petersen, best-known for his direction of the gritty submarine drama 'Das Boot', chose a children's fantasy for his first American film. But The Neverending Story is a fanciful, engaging, and thoroughly enchanting fairy tale, and has become a bit of a classic of the genre!
The story appears to be simple; a young boy named Bastian, withdrawn since his mother's death, and the target of local bullies, finds refuge in a magical book about a mythical world called Fantasia, filled with sweet and bizarre creatures, an ethereally beautiful Empress (played by the luminous Tami Stronach), and a young hero (Battlestar Galactica's Noah Hathaway) that he immediately relates to.
What truly sets this film apart is its underlying message of 'What Is Real?' The characters of the story keep referring to Bastian, and how he must save their world. Bastian must learn to use his imagination, to let go of preconceptions of reality...and, ultimately, the viewer is given the same choice, as well, in one of the most novel twists I've seen in a film in a long time!
Being produced by an international team, the film has a decidedly European 'feel', even with the participation of Gerald McRaney ('Simon and Simon', 'Major Dad') and the other American actors. Major pluses include the beautiful theme music, some terrific low-key creatures (I LOVED the giant flying dog!), and an approach to fantasy that is closer in spirit to 'The Princess Bride' than 'The Lord of the Rings'.
While the DVD has a great 'look', it has virtually no special features; one hopes a 'Director's Cut' DVD might eventually be made! Also, be forewarned that various sequels to this film have been produced, that aren't NEARLY as good as the original. THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY!

625121,3,6303212395,"The Never Ending Story was a top selling German Children's book that repeated its success when translated into English. It is a complex book in that it interweaves a story about a lonley boy whose mother had died some time ago. His father stunned by his wife's death has problems giving his son the love and support needed. The son walks into a strange bookshop and finds a book called the ""Never Ending Story"". The book combines a story about a fantasy kingdom with the boys reaction to what he reads.
The action in the fantasy kingdom revolves around the threat to this kingdom by the ""nothing"". The reality being its destruction by non belief. A warrior boy sets out to counter this menace and has a range of adventures on the way.
The charm of the book was the complexity of the story and the interaciton between the boy reading and the story unfolding.

625123,4,6303212395,"Like so many other reviewers, I watched this as a small child. My kindergarten teacher just loved it. At the time, I found it horrible, dark and scary. (I was a VERY wimpy movie watcher, Raiders of the Lost Ark sent me into hysterics)
Years later, I decided to bite the bullet and try it again. I found it to be a lovely pure fantasy with (for the time) great special effects and good music. Let's face it, you either love electronic fantasy scores or you hate them, there's no real middle ground.
That said, I do think that this movie is too scary for small children, parents should use their own experience and knowledge to decide when their child is ready. (That is what the PG means)
This is the tale of a sensitive child who finds himself being absorbed into the magical book he is reading, called the Neverending Story. (That is where the movie gets its name, the story is different for each person, thus it never ends. There was no ripoff) Dragons, monsters and beautiful images dance in his head as he slowly realizes that the characters in the book are talking to him.
The movie is based on a German novel of the same name by Michael Ende. (a master of surrealist fairy tales for grown ups) Yes, the book is better and yes, the movie only takes the first half of the book. But really, isn't it better to take the first half mostly intact rather than try to cram in every single scene and totally alienate all viewers? What this book really needs is a miniseries but until then, this movie is great.
Two other questions raised were what was the name Bastion yelled. Moonchild, and it wasn't his mother's name in the book (though it is possible if she were a hippy '_') The second question was about the attic. AS the book was written by a German, one may presume that some German schools have attics. Or maybe it was just another fairy tale element added to make the story more surreal. (Attics always seem to figure into fairy tales) either way, it is a relatively small thing to worry about.
This is a very fine example of 80s fantasy, it has a good message and if you or your children are not easily frightened, it is a very good movie on a rainy day. As an owner of 186 books all I can say is see the movie, savour the book.",1010534400,155,2236,4.31353919239905

Many people who aren't into books would miss this terrific opportunity.  I *am* ""into"" books, and I still missed this one, and if it weren't for the movie then I wouldn't have enjoyed one of the greatest stories I have ever seen on film.
This movie isn't just for kids.  It is rich in symbology that will amaze you as it slowy dawns on you just how multi-layered this story is.  An example is The Swamp of Sadness, and how it symbolizes the ""Dark Night of the Soul"" that we each ultimately have to journey though in our own lives, as we face our adversities that we think we cannot possibly overcome.  Our weakness is an illusion that we must not give in to, or we are lost.  Amazing symbology; truly outstanding.
It is like this throughout the entire movie.  One of my favorite scenes involved looking into a mirror. But I won't say more because I don't want to risk spoiling the story for you.
This movie is terrific and will mesmerize both kids and adults, alike!

625162,5,6303212395,"I just barely bought this movie on DVD and watched it last night - what a great flick! This one really ranks up there with my personal favorites. I wish I would have seen it in the movie theater when it first came out. I would have been eight at the time, but I guess I missed this one. I don't remember the first time I saw this flick, but all my favorites that I do see on the big screen, always stand out vividly.
Still, for the first time, I got to see it widescreen, as it is supposed to be seen, and it was absolutely amazing, not to mention ten times better than seeing it simply fullscreen. If you get to see it on DVD, I would *highly* recommend it. You can see the scenery much, much better, and its dazzling. The picture and sound quality are great, too.
If there were ever a kid I could relate to, or a character in film, Bastian would be it. He even has a cool name! The movie is based on a story written in German (as far as I understand). I've never read the book, but I'm certain it would be just as good, if not better. Anyway, the main kid, Bastian, is (like me) a little obssessed with fantasy, and loves to daydream. Of course, I can still get away with it, too, since I've got ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivty Disorder - I can't sit still and can't pay attention for too long). Obviously, reading a good book is a lot better than taking a stupid math class, and I'm sure I'd do the same thing he did. As he reads the story, it comes to life to us, and we get to see what is happening in the story. Near the end, the two intermix quite a bit, and Bastian comes to save Fantasia, where imagination is without boundaries.
The movie is truly imagination-inspiring. That's why, after so many years from my early childhood, I can still remember it very well - especially the very end, where he is able to wish as many wishes as he wants. That idea sure took off in my head!
Fortunately, and unlike *most* fantasy flicks we run into, this one is very well done. I've found that there's generally a large division on good fantasy movies - either they are very good, like this one, or they really, really stink (for example, The NeverEnding Story II). The whole idea really works, though the dialouge is there only so adults can follow the plot. The kids couldn't care how it fits together, since there's so much going on that just sparks the mind.
This is a great flick for kids, and for anyone who dreams, or daydreams (like I do), and enjoys genuinely good fantasy flicks. Also another great feature is it's absolutely clean. There's two semi-scary parts: when the dead knight's mask flies open (for a young kid like me, that *was* a bit tramautizing), and when Atreyu kills the black beast - that is kinda bloody for a kid's movie, but oh well - it didn't scare me as much.
The only minor miff I have with this movie is the Childlike Empress. Ugh! Here's a classic case of a child actress trying to act beyond her age (and skills). With most kid movies though, they generally have a young male and female, to appeal to both sexes, so if the girls are turned off with this movie, I can completely understand why. The guys have lots of cool figures to relate to (Bastian and Atreyu). The poor girl certainly tries, but it's pretty obvious at the same time. If it weren't for that cheesy grin, than I'd probably leave her alone. It's not that bad though, but it does seem a bit melodramatic.
Overall, a great flick. I tell you what. I'm glad I have it on DVD, so I can really enjoy it. The trailer on it is a treat. It's the theatrical trailer, so it's widescreen, and it is in fine condition. On some DVDs I've seen, it seems like they pulled the film right from the trash can and didn't bother cleaning it up much (the trailer on Tron, for example). But, like I said, this is a great one to see on DVD, and watch it widescreen, to get the whole picture. It's always fun to go back to Fantasia. The really sucky part is that we can't always stay there. *sigh*",1004313600,3,3977,4.24802110817942

I am extremely impressed with its breathtaking landscapes and its brilliant acting. This movie far surpasses its two successors in both quality and content. Despite the obviously fantastic nature of the story, the viewer can easily become engaged in the story, and find that they believe every moment. Viewers will find that they, too, are part of The NeverEnding Story.
I have read the original German book, and I find the movie to be a very good adaptation of the parts of the book the movie covers. Although the book has MUCH more than the movie, the parts that the movie uses have been recreated on screen very well. There are only one or two major differences between the movie and the book, along with a few minor differences. Of course, such things can't be avoided when adapting a book into a screenplay.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone! I also recommend that anyone who likes the movie read the book. I have never read the translated edition, but the original German is fabulous!",1004313600,5,1124,4.625

A boy reading a fantasy novel gets involved in the story and finds out that it is only the imagination of a human child that can save the fantasy world from the ""Nothing."" - a theme that is so wonderfully beautiful and true.
The scenery is beautiful, and in my opinion so much more captivating than the cheesy computer animation that is taking over the film industry now.
Even as a child, and now as an adult, I sat through the whole movie, just to see the Child-like Empress, who is incredibly beautiful. (What ever happened to that actress?)

I had, I believe, seen the movie at some point before this, but the movie only tells the story of the first half of the book!  To be perfectly honest, I would have to say that the movie is disappointing to someone who's read the book, but it certainly has retained some of the child-like fantasy fascination that the book captured in such a powerful way, and is much less imposing to someone who wants to relax for the evening.
  The somber mood of the movie matches that of the book fairly well, but it must be remembered that the book itself has a very important message about the abuse of power that defines the second half.  All in all, the movie is a good production in and of itself, but the true work of art is the book, which should be a part of any personal and family library.",999734400,4,1044,4.301020408163265
625207,5,6303212395,"I got this in the mail today-earlier than expected.  What a great surprise!  The STORY...finally on DVD!  And what a top notch DVD transition.  From the time the title tune fades in and the strikingly colorful clouds appear on the screen I was hooked once again with this little bit of childish magic.  This widescreen version is a first for me (I was too old, dismissing this when it originally came out and had to discover it on ""fit your screen"" cable).  Let me say I have no complaints about how the STORY looks or sounds.  Pay attention and you'll notice things you didn't before.  I was amazed at the shimmering scales on the luckdragon, the enormous size of Morla, the detail of Gmork in the confrontation scene (I thought he was just a head but there's legs and a body), all the wonderful little details in Urgl and Engywook's little house.  So much more too.  And let me say again that the color is amazing!  Very little artifacts or graininess.  And the soundtrack will fill your room with music!  The movie itself is incredible on DVD.  This is the only way to watch it!
So is there anything I didn't like?  Well, I could complain about the lack of extras.  There is a ""making of"" section; but it's just a few paragraphs of text.  Informative, but sparse.  Commentary is one reason to buy a DVD version.  I'd like to know what ever happened to Noah Hathaway, Barret Oliver and the rest of the players.  Words from the director can really put a new twist on your impressions of a movie and how they did certain scenes (just watch TIME BANDITS with Terry Gilliam!  Great fun!).  But we don't get that here.  Then again the movie is not priced like a special edition so maybe that's in the future.  The theatrical trailer was a welcome extra (WB sometimes leaves that off too).

I revisited this movie recently, having not seen it since I was young, when it was my favorite movie. I was struck by some logical inconsistencies (Why is Atreiu the only hope? Aren't there some grown-up Plains warriors who would fare better? Why can't he take his bow and arrow??) But that's the cynical adult in me talking. The movie has such terrific effects and the puppets are incredible. Both the Luck Dragon and the Rock Biter look more real than the digital characters in recent movies.
And as for Bastien's ""wish"" at the end of the movie.....it's exactly what any little boy would want. What a great movie!!!",999129600,154,1023,4.535135135135135
625247,5,6303212395,"Scoff if you will at the dated appearance and juvenile dialogue of ""The Neverending Story,"" but chances are, if you happen upon someone who has seen the film, your opinions will differ immensely. Based on the novel by Michael Ende, this highly imaginative and visually sumptuous fairy tale is nothing short of astounding, and certainly a step forward in the children's film genre in its time.
 Truth be told, there is nothing quite like this film, and while attempts at sequels have failed miserably, they are unable to hinder the effect it has on its viewers. It sticks with you, in your mind, from the opening theme song to the stunning visual effects and dark undertones that permeate the story's conflict.
 The film begins when a young boy is chased down the street and hides in a bookstore to evade his pursuants. Bastian is a small child, though highly educated and an enthusiatic reader, though his mother's recent death have caused his school grades to hinder and his relationship with his father to turn stale. Which is why his interest is peaked when he happens upon a book by the name of ""The Neverending Story,"" a large volume whose cover is enough to intrigue even the audience into sticking with the film.
 As Bastian begins reading the story, he is transported into the world of Fantasia, where a mysterious force known only as The Nothing is destroying this elegant land. Many citizens of Fantasia have made their way to the Ivory Tower to seek the help of the Empress, who is fatally ill. Only one can find a cure for her illness: Atreju, a preteen warrior of the plains people who is called upon to seek out and destroy The Nothing and save the Empress from death. This begins both of their journeys: Atreju's treck across the land to find some hope of saving the increasingly deteriorating land, and Bastian's realization that he is playing a much larger role in the events of the book than he dares to think about. Atreju learns that discovering the answers to his questions means looking inside himself, while the both of them must find the courage to face their fears and save Fantasia before it is too late.
 For many who see the film, the connectiveness between these two worlds will seem silly to the point of absurdity. But this is not a film for such a mindset: this is a children's fantasy film, a delightful deluge of important morals and values that children are instilled with at an early age. From courage and faith, to truth and heroism, these traditional values are effectively dispersed throughout, and succeed in conveying their messages.
 For those who enjoy out-of-this-world landscapes and breathtaking vistas, this is a real treat. Fantasia is a place of endless beauty, cut with settings of dismal terror. The Ivory Tower stands as a pinnacle of hope against the setting sun, while such places as the Swamps of Sadness and the Southern Oracle, are treacherous and foreboding. The Nothing is the centerpiece for the film's visual delights, shown in the form of storms and endless dark clouds.
 Parents should not miss letting their child in on ""The Neverending Story,"" which has a lasting impact like no other film of its kind. Wolfgang Petersen's first English-language film is a striking example of excellence, no matter how you look at it. The film itself may have an ending, but its final message and the memory it leaves is endless.",998870400,20,3377,4.764102564102564

The release of this classic on DVD is an event that I look forward to.  The adventures of Atrayu and Bastian are truly our own, as the quest to defeat the Nothing is a mirror of the eternal spiritual quest discussed by Joseph Cambell in many writings.  While Atrayu makes a physical journey, Bastian makes the journey internally, only to discover that he IS Atrayu and that the story is his own.
The special effects are MAGNIFICENT, even by today's standards.  In fact, they are better than today's glitzy 3D CGI, because they are a supliment to the storytelling, not a subsitute for it.  As I watched the clunky anamatronic face of Falcor, I thought how beautiful he could be in CGI, but then I contemplated the fact that if the movie were made today, and animators spent time in CG making him, he'd HAVE to be the center of the movie, instead of a supporting character, which is where he belongs.  There is also a realness, and emotion, on his mechanical face that CGI never seems to capture with its soulless perfection.  Even though it was made in the early 80's, I was fascinated at how well they make me feel like I'm really there with Atrayu, standing beneath the monstrosity of the Southern Oracle, in all its bohemoth mammiary glory!  We really feel like we're flying with Falcor to the top of the Ivory tower to find the little flower-shaped shrine of Moonchild.  This film is visual storytelling at its VERY best.

Released in 1984, this movie is perhaps the best of the classic 80s fantasy resurgence. Along with The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth and Ridley Scott's Legend, The Neverending Story lets us all escape from reality for a while.
This film, however, rises above others in its genre by offering a somewhat postmodern examination of the desires and needs for escape from everyday life. Drawing comparisons between Bastian's storybook readings and our own cinema-going, the film ultimately condones such escapist daydreaming - disapproved of by Bastian's father early in the movie - and offers us hope that if we follow those dreams with all our heart, we will achieve them.
Visually stunning with Ul de Rico's inimitable production design, and directed with a beautifully non-Hollywood flare by German director Wolfgang Petersen, The Neverending Story is a film to be not only enjoyed but cherished. On the surface it's an exhiliarating fantasy ride, below it's an examination of the childhood daydreams most of us have given up on or forgotten. Relive them.
All the leads are strong, with some brilliant supporting performances from actors and creatures alike. Followed by George 'Mad Max' Miller's sequel in 1990, which was watchable but suffered from the lead-cast changes (unavoidable as the original actors were hitting twenty), and an abysmal third installment in 1994, which should be avoided at all costs.
NOTE: This review was written just prior to the release of the DVD version. I hope Warners give the film the treatment it deserves - no film with $27m of production design in it goes without supplementary material. There are two versions of the film, the German version containing Klaus Doldinger's complete score and lacking Giorgio Moroder's memorable theme song.

The Never Ending Story has two heroes and two villains. The first hero and villain are outside the book, high above the fantasy.
Bastian is a young kid that is blessed with a great imagination (He gets in trouble for drawing unicorns in his math book.) He lacks courage and is always being beaten up by bullies and stuffed into dumpsters. While running away from these bullies, he hides in a bookstore. When in there, he makes off with a book that has the snake-twisted orrin on the cover...you guessed it...the neverending story.
""The Nothing"", is the first ultra-villain. It's reason for existence is a secret that I don't want to spoil. It is destroying fantasia for its own means(Brought to life by the guys that invisioned The Empire Strikes Back!) The Nothing is becoming rampant, and the ruler, the Empress is dying. The people of fantasia, the world in which all fantasy resides, seek help from a great warrior Atreau. The ultimate second villain, A massive wolf with Glowing green eyes, takes flight through the forests to stop Atreau on his quest.

No Kidding! Books often are! With a book, you can eliminate (in your mind) all those details which you dislike... and heighten the ones you like. It's YOUR daydream. With a movie... it's the director's daydream.
That said, I found this movie beautiful, poignant and very magical. Sure, I saw it for the first time as a child, but I'm not a child anymore, and I STILL love it. The characters and costumes are gorgeous, and I love some of the more archetypal characters. Also, the make-up effects and creature designing is first-rate for 1984.

Now that I am 17, I understand it and it's harder to let go of then Rainbow Brite and the Goonies. Although the technology shows it's age, the sets are still beautiful, and the characters are magical. Noah Hathaway portrays the hero in such a way that kids wish they could be in the story with him.

It was one of the best fantasy books I'd ever read. I remember being so excited when this movie was finally coming out- an actual live-action rendition of what I'd imagined for so long. But the movie was quite shallow in comparison, and designed for children. The book was designed for adults, though children would find it enjoyable. The sad thing is this could have been so much better, so much more true to the book and philosophical and engaging.

But perhaps the problem was this book should never have been made into a movie. It's uniqueness precluded smooth transition to the screen. Every chapter ends with, ""But that is another story."" It made you feel like this was real, and continuing on. This was further impacted by the merging of reality and literature that is occurring within the storyline (portrayed in the movie), reminding the reader and the viewer that they are actually reading and watching, just as the main character is, but the main character is drawn into the fantasy, and so maybe, just maybe, we can be too.

The movie ends with someone saying how many wishes Bastian gets to have fulfilled. The book shows just how furtile the entire proces of wishing is; it is a mystical tour-de-force. The book is 10 million times the calibre of a cartain litle wizard who is getting too famous for the good of him. It has depth. It has everything. Read it!

625344,5,6303212395,"It's weird how some movies stay with you.  I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out, and I've loved it ever since. Back then, I  admired the strength of Atreyu and related to the desperation of Bastian,  and I thought to myself ""There they are - who I am and who I want to  be.""
I'm older now, and I can see some flaws in the film that I  didn't see before, primarily in terms of special effects (Good old  Falkor....)  It still ranks as one of my favorite movies ever, though.  I  still get a lump in my throat when I see the scene with Artax in the swamp,  and I've been known to utter the phrase, ""They look like big, strong  hands, don't they?"" when things are not going quite as well as I have  planned.
This movie, of course, led me to read the book, the first half  of which is the basis for this film (the story is completed in ""NES  2,"" which doesn't hold a candle to this film.  In my opinion), and the  book, too, occupies a high place for me.  Film or book, it's a great buy.  Give your kids some magic.  They'll thank you for it.",967680000,,1057,4.019323671497585
625345,5,6303212395,"What more can I say?  This movie has everything you need: The characters  are plentiful, unique and vividly detailed, the plot is engaging and  well-paced, and the visuals are some of the most vibrant and memorable that  I've ever seen (and considering that NES was made 16 years ago, before  anyone knew what ""computer-generated image"" meant, that's saying  something).  You can't help but be moved by the beauty of the fantastic  world (the first sight of the Ivory Tower is unforgettable) and the tragedy  of its downfall (the Rockbiter's second appearance is simply  heartbreaking).
NES also does its part to remind us that dreams,  imagination, and fantasy in general are at least as important as real life.  The message is blatantly delivered but no less valid for that.  When we  can no longer imagine a world that's different from or better than our own,  when we can no longer imagine ourselves as more than we are, we lose the  ability to make that world or to become that person.  Forget your dreams  and you have nothing to look forward to, nothing to strive for.  Lose your  hope and life becomes worthless.
Many would say NES is for kids, but  the people who say that are exactly the people who would benefit most from  absorbing the message.  They're right in the sense that children enjoy  fantasy, but what they fail to understand is that while adults certainly  have more specific goals and more refined imaginations, they need to  partake of fantasy every now and again, too.  Anything you can't escape  becomes a prison, and if you forget how to escape reality, your stay will  be long and torturous.

For one thing, the  book is much more in depth, Artax can talk in the book, Falkor looks  ""leonine"" (it specifically states ""leonine face""),  Atreyu is much more noble, and the southern oracle is way more than just a  couple of sphinxes. One thing I want to clear up forever: FALKOR IS NOT A  GIANT FLYING DOG! HE IS A LUCK DRAGON AND IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK PEARLY WHITE,  DRAGONLIKE, AND LIONLIKE AT THE SAME TIME! Also, the book goes way beyond  Bastian just saying the child-like empresses' name. The second, and  especially the third movies are even worse! They should each have -10  stars!

I am very much into fantasy stories, and this  movie has nearly everything.  The only thing it lacks is a little bit of  romance.  However, the movie makes up for this with its awesome music and  great backgrounds.  The set designers should be very pleased with  themselves.  Once you see this movie, you will remember the theme song  forever (maybe not the words, but the tune)!  It is beautiful.  Besides the  romance issue, the only problem I really had with the movie is that the  Empress is only in it at the very end.  It kind of works for her because  she gets to have a ""grand entrance.""  However, I think that  younger girls might shy away from this film because there is not really a  strong leading female character.  Older girls will like it because of Noah  Hathaway!  Anyway, I have not read the bood yet so I do not know if the  Empress's limited screen time follows her role in the book, but I guess  that whatever the book did, I hope that that is what the movie did,  too.

The saddest part is when Atreyu's  horse, Artax, dies in the swamps of despair.  I cry every single time I see  that. It's not just that I'm a horse lover; it's the saddest thing I've  seen ever in a movie.  The actors are brilliant, to say the least.  Not  one minute, even in my mature and wise (ha!) teenage years, did I not  believe the characters and what they stood for.  13 years later, Atreyu is  still as noble, courageous, true, and real as he was when I was young.

Especially the flying white dragon that greatly resembles a big, friendly  puppy dog! In this film, a brave young boy being chased by school bullies  and having to put up with an indifferent dad secretly smuggles a  unusual-looking book out of an musty old bookstore. Then he hides in a  school closet to read all about ""himself"" as the hero setting out  on a great quest to save the dying world from the unseen evil. Imagine a  young child becoming quite enthralled by a real storybook, especially the  part where he cries over the death of the hero's horse deep in the depths  of a treacherous swampland. And there are also frightening parts  in this  imaginative yarn as well, yet it is still quite a welcome change for young  people being raised in the age of really gross and scary movies like  ""The Gremlins"" and ""The Blade Runner"".

625482,5,6303212395,"When this movie first came out, I was 4 years old. My parents rented it for us kids on video about two years later. At the time I was absolutely enthralled by the story; as it progressed I was frightened, saddened,  excited, and joyful in turns. I don't think I've ever been as involved with  a story as I was then. I just watched it again this evening, after over a  decade, and I have to say that even at the age of 19 I am still impressed  by this movie. There is a lot in the Never-Ending Story that would be  wasted on children. Much of it is very profound, for example; the empire of  Fantasia being reduced to a single grain of sand, which becomes the seed  for its rebirth - a universe of potential in a grain of sand.  The two  boys, Atreju and Sebastian, who at first appear to be complete opposites,  as one is a warrior and the other a bookish dreamer are revealed to be  strikingly similar. Bastion discovers that his courage- the courage to  dream- is just as powerful, if not more, than the bravery of warriors like  Atreju. The writer's thoughts on the nature of hope and its relationship  with tyranny were enlightened. A people without hope are easy to control.  Only adults would see the real world implications of this.  The special  effects have also withstood the test of time, simply because the effects  used complemented the story and not the other way around. By today's  standards the sfx in this movie are still amazing, and even with inevitable  technological improvements in the years to come I doubt this movie will  ever be obsolete. I would continue on and gush about the magnificent music,  fantastic scenery, and colourful characters but other reviewers seem to  have beaten me to it.
