7011840,5,B00TKIJGDA,Fantastic horror/revenge tale.  Has a few twists you won't expect that makes care all the more about what happens to Zoe!,1426032000,4,121,4.761904761904762
7011841,3,B00TKIJGDA,movie was about what I expected,1426032000,,31,4.333333333333333
7011842,5,B00TKIJGDA,"It is a very good low budget horror movie - it has got really something.

And the music is awesome too, in particular Amycanbe opening track: ""Rose Is A Rose"" - amazing!",1425686400,3,169,4.28125
7011843,5,B00TKIJGDA,"This has to be the best horror film I have seen so far this year!
Think ""I Spit On Your Grave"" meets ""Dead Girl"".
There is no down time, the film starts off with a bang and doesn't let up.

Although it's very racially offensive, it only serves as a catalyst for us to hate all the more, the gang of rednecks that Kill Indians for sport, use the N word and kidnap, rape and brutalize our Heroine ""Zoe"" played flawlessly by Amanda Adrienne.

This has gore galore and very well done gore at that. I was amazed at the production value of this film. The lighting was amazing and reminded me of the film (Borderland) .All of the acting was above average as well. After this ordeal Zoe has one thing on her mind, Revenge! It's a lot of fun watching her get it too.

I highly highly recommend this film. It's what we as slasher/horror lovers have been waiting for this year. I don't want to give more of the movie away than the synopsis does,but I will tell you there's an awesome chainsaw duel.

I'm in no way affiliated with this film, I have over 500 reviews and most are horror.",1425600000,54,1074,4.25
7011844,5,B00TKIJGDA,This was done along the lines of Kill Bill but with a twist! One of the best horror movies I've seen this year! Highly recommended for horror buffs!,1518048000,,148,4.321428571428571
7011845,5,B00TKIJGDA,"Very surprised .. acting good. in beginning thought it was going to be bad , turned out well.. blood and gore.. cheering on the processed.",1517788800,,138,4.56
7011846,4,B00TKIJGDA,"I came into this movie with a LOT of doubts about possible quality...but left rather amazed. This is a really good movie along the lines of 'I Spit on Your Grave', but with far better story, acting, flow and ending. For a lower-budget film, the cinematography was quite good even. Though most of the actors were relatively unknown, the acting job of all was quite impressive too. Overall, I was torn between giving this a 4 and a 5, but as there were some facets that could have been better, I left it at 4.  DEFINITELY worth watching, if you like the 'Punisher' type of movies.",1516492800,,578,4.452830188679245
7011847,4,B00TKIJGDA,"Except for a couple of cheesy CGI scenes, it was actually a pretty decent movie.",1516406400,,80,4.4
7011848,4,B00TKIJGDA,"R&R is not my favorite genre but this was actually pretty decent. I liked that Zoe was aware of what was happening even when she wasn't in control so she knew these monsters were getting what they deserved. I would have liked to know if her trying to help the young Apache man they killed in the beginning had anything to do with the spirit connecting to her when it did not happen with any of their Apache victims.

My only problem is with the plot summary referring to the men as 'rednecks'. They were what we call white trash and there is a very big difference, but it's nearly impossible to thoroughly understand our social hierarchy if you aren't born to it.  Being a redneck is not a bad thing and never has been, and in our culture crimes like this are beyond unacceptable; the rednecks would be the ones looking to take out the trash.",1515888000,2,842,4.356687898089172

7011851,4,B00TKIJGDA,"Wow!. I passed by this movie several times, for a long time, because I didn't think it would be any good. Today, I took a chance on it, and I'm glad I did. It turned out to be way better than I thought it would be. It was very intense and exciting to watch. I really enjoyed it.",1506470400,,278,3.810344827586207

7011859,5,B00TKIJGDA,"If you're a true horror fan and love lots of gore, this one's for you.  This chilling flick about a woman that is abducted out in the middle of nowhere and brutally ravaged by a group of low-life freaks, is a classic ""revenge"" film...much like the Tarantino genre.  Amanda Adrienne is the perfect actress in this role.  The makeup is gruesome in transforming her from an innocent young woman into a she-devil from Hell.  I gave it all 5 stars because it never dragged...always coming back with more thrills and twists until the very end.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.",1498176000,,581,4.592233009708738

After a brutal run-in along the way, she is united with a vengeful Indian warrior's soul and together the seek vengeance from the same bloodline that wronged them both.

7011869,4,B00TKIJGDA,"What can you say about an Apache/Zombie spatter flick?  Just summing it up in a sentence pretty much tells you everything you can expect to need to know about it but I went into this with both eyes open, expecting a soggy, squelching couple of hours' break from reality and got something almost tolerable.

If gore on every available surface but the fourth wall is your cup of evening meat, you'll love it.  If not, you may still find a way to choke it down but you have been warned.  Go ahead and watch it, just don't blame me.  I will, however, accept your thanks. . .  At a good distance.",1492646400,2,591,4.2792792792792795

7011876,3,B00TKIJGDA,"I was pleasantly surprised upon watching this movie. It pretty obvious that it is a low budget film. The special effects were really not that special. The dialogue/script writing left little to be desired. But the story line had great potential. Almost like a different version of ""I spit on your grave"". It would have been much better if a bigger budget had been available.

7011881,3,B00TKIJGDA,"I gave this three stars since it was ok. SPOILERS - The story was ridiculous and didn't make much sense. The action starts off with a team of rednecks in a truck chasing down an Apache indian. They run him over and it seems like its that cliche movie scene where the rednecks just enjoy killing minorities. But wait, there's more. This band of rednecks is based around a family that have been murdering Apaches for over 100 years. See, their great, great granddaddy was an important guy in the army, and he was tasked with killing all of the Apaches in the world, I think. They don't really explain that part. He was just ordered to kill them all and decided to make it a family business that has carried on for 150 years. That's where I decided to stop paying attention to the story. The makeup, effects and action are decent as is the ending. I like the idea as a whole, but it wasn't written very well across the whole movie.

The film forgets that the lead is deaf a couple times. She goes from staring intently at another person's mouth as they are speaking, to just staring off into nothing while they finish. She later shows that she 'heard' the conversation with her actions so why keep showing her trying to read their lips? Or did the Apache ghost have a mouth fetish to go with his ghost ears? Did she spend hours practicing the timing and order of the prompts of the particular collect call service she uses? Or did she perfectly navigate the call through luck, on a pay phone that hasn't been disconnected yet?

Most of my gripes were just annoyances that were only made bigger because of how many there were. The vistas weren't even all that amazing.",1484179200,,1664,4.434640522875817

7011900,5,B00TKIJGDA,"This film was produced with a budget under one million dollars and that is an awesome feat. First of all a person who is deaf is just that, Deaf! This film is repeatedly reviewed as having the protagonist referred to as a ""Deaf Mute"" which is an antiquated term and an insult to the Deaf & Hard of Hearing community. We don't use the word ""Retard"" any more but mentally challenged. Deaf mute is a term from 100 years ago. Just because a reviewer used it does not validate it. The film deals with a group of descendants of European Indian fighters who tortured and killed real life Indian War Chief ""Mangas Colorados"" who in real life was Six feet six inches tall and was tricked into capture under the guise of a piece treaty. The film does deal with an actual legend in ""Mangas Colorados but the film is a narrative Horror, protagonist history figure, love story and special effects made with a very low budget.",1475539200,,912,4.467065868263473

A group of these vicious specimens rape and murder a deaf-mute white women who witnesses their unprovoked murder of an Apache youth.

So we are presented with the villains (white men). As heroes, Hollywood presents us with Apaches, white women, deaf-mutes, and the woman's black boyfriend.

The Hollywood hate-mongers depict graphic, unjustified violence against minorities as the pretext for showing more viciously graphic violence and sadistic ""justice"" inflicted on the villainous White Men.

The real villains are the Hollywood scriptwriters, actors, directors, and producers who fill the heads of American youth with this despicable anti-social propaganda.",1474675200,3,812,5.982758620689655

7011906,3,B00TKIJGDA,"Avenged is nothing more than a decent low budget revenge horror film. That's fine. I like this stuff. I don't even care if it's a ripoff of ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" with Native American supernatural forces mixed in. I've always found that stuff to be hokey, but I'll go along for the ride. The story is quite familiar, but who cares, it's cheap horror. The characters are reasonably well developed for this genre, although the acting is spotty enough to knock the movie down a peg. The art direction is mostly good and the lighting is effective. The cinematography is fairly good most of the time, but too often, seriously betrays the film's low budget. The gore effects and CGI are good enough, considering. I could have enjoyed the movie and given it 4 stars for being above average and reasonably entertaining. But I'd bet my right eye that the 5 star reviews (9-10 stars on IMDb) are written by people with some connection to the filmmaker. This movie is just too flawed, in really big, obvious ways for that many people to love it that much. So watch it if you want, but I'd recommend lowering your expectation if you don't want to feel cheated at the end, as I and most of the honest reviewer were.",1473292800,,1203,4.497716894977169

I wasn't sure at first but the script (yes great script), acting (terrific all around), gore, humor (there is some), rednecks (very genuine) and the heartbreak.  Plus the Indian lore and the where it was filmed.  Fantastic lead performance as well as very strong by even more minor characters.

7011939,3,B00TKIJGDA,"This is a violation-and-revenge flick, and the violation is pretty bad, so if you're squeamish about such things this movie may not be for you.

The lead character is a woman, but I would not say that this is ""a film about strong (or strong-willed) women."" Yes, she leads all the action shots, but there's no depth at all to the lead female character. If you replaced her with a run-away truck, the results would be just about the same.

The violation/revenge thing is good and bad. The good side is that the action in this film keeps moving. There's never a dull moment. That said, you know what happens next, and what happens after that, and then after that. This film is not eligible for a spoiler alert. Still, I won't spoil things. There's some supernatural stuff built into it, but otherwise there's nothing very original. It's like a roller coaster you've been on about 5 or 6 times before.",1462838400,,897,4.565217391304348

Your taste buds relay high happiness messages but in reality you are ingesting a low quality and cheap filler. It seems that Amazon Prime takes a similar tact with their free movie catalog; typically serving poorly acted, dreadfully scripted, and lackluster crockbuster ""films"" to trick your senses into a value-added consumer satiation.

Let me tell you... Avenged is the ""A grade"" stuff, the folks in the Amazon kitchen broke the mold by giving us Avenged.

Honestly, how many indie horror flicks can you find, anywhere, rated 86% 'fresh' on Rotten Tomatoes?  I can't do better than 'Tomatoes' without risking a spoiler, so here is their summary:  ""A lethal injection of scares, thrills, romance, and the supernatural, director Michael S. Ojeda's confronting revenge film delivers on all levels and deserves to be viewed, discussed, and then viewed again.""  I liked the flick, but if you are one of those people who like to complain that, ""OMG, that would never happen,"" then please skip this film - and also skip ""The Exorcist,"" ""Hellraiser,"" ""The Shining,"" and any other horror flick ever made ... they ain't about reality, folks.

Normally I don't do horror flicks, too gross, too implausible, too cliched. But something about this one caught my eye, so I gave it a chance. It's become one of my favorite films ever and here's why--the heroine. The actress who plays Zoe, the deaf girl just driving cross-country to be with her sweetie, packs some serious acting chops. We get to see her character start out as someone rather innocent and sweet, the kind of person who would need someone else to kill the spider in the bathroom for her--no wait, actually she'd scoop the spider up into a cup and put it outside rather than kill it. That's Zoe. She's like a blonde unicorn and the first time she runs into serious trouble you find yourself praying someone, anyone will come along and rescue her.

But of course, no one does until after the unthinkable happens. And then it's Zoe who comes to the rescue, rising from the ashes of unthinkable horror with the help of a new friend from the other side who also has a score to settle with the same people who rape, torture and leave our heroine for dead. As one of the characters in the film so aptly puts it, ""You drag an angel into hell and she becomes a demon."" And that's what happens to our girl Zoe. She's a former angel turned butt-kicking, murderous redneck offing demon with a cause.

Added bonus, watching Zoe's boyfriend who's tied up and being used as bait shouting with savage glee ""Baby, give 'em hell"" when he realizes Zoe is offing the bad guys and has come to rescue him. All too often we get treated to the guy having to rescue the girl and I loved seeing how this played out with a girl that normally couldn't open a jar of peanut butter being the one to rush in and save the day.

All in all this is your typical revenge flick, but having a frail deaf girl play the victim turned fighter while getting a little help from an Apache warrior's ghost just makes this a cut above your average rape/revenge movie. And the theme of star-crossed lovers is a definite nod to the Crow that will delight people who loved that film.

This move won't thrill those whose primary purpose in horror flicks is gore and grossness, although there's still plenty of that. But if you want an interesting story that gives a different take on how a woman might just be possessed of enough strength and skill to actually take out the bad guys (something most rape/revenge stories don't really get into) then this one is definitely worth watching.",1449792000,,2534,4.488069414316703

7012170,5,B00TKIJGDA,"I didn't expect for the film to have so much heart for a revenge flick. This is mostly due to Amanda Adrienne's portrayal of Zoey. Given that the character is ""deaf and mute"" she rarely has any lines, so the use of her facial expression and even the tonality of her sorrowful to rage laced screams give the character an emotional depth that goes far and beyond what was anticipated. I also must give her credit for her handling of weaponry and fluidity of movement. All in all, great movie.",1449446400,,490,4.455555555555556

7012210,1,B00TKIJGDA,"Avenged had a 4 star rating which encouraged me to waste an hour of my life that I'll never get back.

We have a beautiful deaf-mute woman (Zoe ) who is raped, beaten, murdered in a horribly gruesome fashion. She then becomes possessed by an avenging warrior that marches here decaying carcass all over hell's half acre seeking revenge.  Using a group of white, slack-jawed, booger eating morons as the evil antagonists, you may suspect that this is an attempt at a PC horror flick, but you would be mistaken. There is not a single character to love. The protagonist is a victim of the avenging warrior, the bungling shaman only appears to continually apologize for screwing up his ceremony, the black boyfriend wanders aimlessly crying  until  the morons capture him to use as bait and the hapless sheriff  has no idea whats going on in his own county.

7012240,5,B00TKIJGDA,"WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS: First a word of warning: Even though this film, and many DTV films, are shown on the TV station CHILLER (and sometimes SyFy), it is the worst way to watch these films because all of the nudity and most of the extreme violence is edited out. Buy or rent the DVD or watch it on VOD streaming, because CHILLER cut nearly nine minutes from this film, literally cutting the film's cahones off, making it look like some zombie revenge film. That being said, I generally don't care too much for assault/revenge films (But for some reason, women do. I remember showing the uncut VHS version Mier Zarchi's I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE [1978] on a rainy day down at our our Summer New Jersey Shore house in the mid-90's, expecting the women to be shocked [I was one of the only guys in a house of 8 women. Color me happy! But I was their escorts and designated driver, because there is nothing worse than a woman at a bar at the New Jersey Shore in the Summer. We were all lifelong friends and nothing romantic ever happened. Besides, one of the women is now my ex-wife!]. They were shocked, especially over the two extended rapes [and rightfully so], but they loved the rest of the film. Every time I see them, even up to this day, they ask if I will ever show this film again. Our New Jersey Shore days are long over, but it surprises me that one of the first things they remember and want to relive is that film!). I don't believe forced sex should ever be displayed as entertainment, but this film is more in the vein of the 2010 remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (The over-the-top violence in this version of the film reminded me most of this film), but with a Native American twist and other zombie elements. And it is just different enough for me to recommend it, mainly because it doesn't wallow in the assault like the 1978 & 2010 films (and also the 2013 & 2015 sequels!). Zoe (Amanda Adrienne, who is absolutely fantastic here) inherits her father's mint 1968 GTO when he passes away. Zoe is a deaf young woman who can talk some English (much in the way Marlee Matlin does) and plans on using the GTO to get out of California and travel to the American Southwest to live with her fiance Dane (Marc Anthony Samuel). Zoe's older sister, Hanna (Sarah J. Stuckey), tries to talk her out of it (I guess the politically correct way is to say ""sign"" her out of it) by saying the American Southwest is vast and can be dangerous, especially for a young, deaf woman, but Zoe has her mind made up and starts her travels (after taking a selfie of her and her sister with her camera, one of her favorite things to do). Zoe should have listened to her older sister. For the first time in her life, Zoe feels free and drives through national parks and sees other unusual sights, sending texts and photos to Dane, telling him she is on her way. Zoe enters New Mexico (I spent a week there one day) and that's when the trouble starts. She stops to take photos of some very unusual cactus plants and then spots the maggot-ridden corpse of a coyote who was definitely killed by human hands with a shotgun, judging by the way its midsection is exposed. Zoe gets back in her GTO and stops at a dumpy little trailer with a sign that says ""Hand Made Native Gifts"" (the proprietor will become an important character later in the film, but we only get a fleeting glimpse of him in this sequence). Zoe looks at various home made Indian objects (including a tomahawk) and then continues driving (we don't know whether she has purchased anything). She's texting Dane while driving (Doesn't she watch all those anti-texting TV commercials? I'm sure they are Close Captioned.) and nearly hits a Native American in the middle of the road who is seriously injured with a gaping wound in his stomach. Zoe pulls the GTO to the side of the road to go help him, but then she sees a bunch of locals chasing another Native American in their truck and run him over. Zoe tries to get the injured Indian into her car and drive away, but the locals, which includes Trey (Rodney Rowland; SOULKEEPER - 2001); West (Tom Ardavany; VELOCITY TRAP - 1998); Creed (John Charles Meyer; THE MILLENNIUM BUG - 2011); Cody (Brionne Davis; REST STOP: DON'T LOOK BACK - 2008), Trey's brother Jed (Ronnie Gene Blevins; THE BLACKOUT - 2014) and Trey's slow (i.e. mentally unbalanced) brother Skeeter (Kyle Morris; COFFIN BABY - 2013), block her from driving away by putting their truck in front of her GTO. While West stabs the injured Indian over and over with his huge knife in the front seat of the GTO, Zoe tries to run away, only to get shot in the leg by Trey. We then see her tied to a bed with barb wire in the home of Trey's mother (Donell Russell) and she sits outside while the guys take turns assaulting Zoe, one even making her suck on the barrel of a pistol (It's bad, but not as bad as the films I mentioned above). West says she's a useless deaf mute who is ""color blind"" (he goes through her purse and finds a photo of her and Dane, who happens to be Black). Speaking about Dane, he becomes increasingly worried when she doesn't show up to their house or send him any more photos or texts on her phone. He looks at the last photo she sent him and in the background there is a sign that reads ""Acme, New Mexico"", so he calls the police department there and heads out to Acme to see if he can find her. The guys continue assaulting Zoe (thankfully, most of it off-screen), but it is the brutal Trey who takes particular delight in raping and torturing her, pouring Jack Daniels on her bullet wound. Trey also has a refrigerator full of old Indian skulls and shows them to Zoe, saying some of them date back to his great-great-grandfather, who was a notorious Indian fighter. His whole family has hated Indians since they have lived in this part of the country, which is at least 200 years. He considers them less than human and takes pleasure in hunting them down and killing them. Some of the heads in the refrigerator are kills of his own. West says that Zoe has to be ""put down"", because if she lives, she will destroy the whole gang and they will be in prison for life. Trey, who is a natural-born gambler, makes a deal with West: They will play one hand of cards and if Trey wins, he gets to keep Zoe as his plaything. If West wins, they will kill her immediately and she will be ""an angel who gets her wings"". Zoe is having flashbacks of Dane proposing to her to get her mind off the pain of her trying to free her arms from the barb wire (it's a really hard scene to watch, as the barb wire slits open her arms from the elbows-down) and she actually gets her arms free, but it is all for naught, since West has won the hand of cards and stabs her over-and-over with his large knife (which is really nothing but an extension of his manhood, since we never see him take part in any of the assaults). West buries Zoe in a shallow grave in the desert, where she is found by Native American tracker Grey Wolf (Joseph Runningfox; RITES OF PASSAGE - 2011), the proprietor of the dumpy trailer selling home made Native American goods that Zoe stopped at earlier in the film, and he brings her dead body back to his home, where he performs an ancient Indian ritual with her body so she can rest in eternal peace. But something goes horribly wrong when the spirit of an ancient Apache warrior enters her body and he tells Grey Wolf that Trey and his friends will ""Now walk...in Hell!"" before he knocks-out Grey Wolf. Zoe is now alive, but like all living dead, her body begins to rot the longer she walks the Earth. Dane has now made it to Acme and is spending the night in a motel, where we watch him flip channels using the remote for the TV and see snippets of THE TERROR (1963) and THE STREETFIGHTER (1974), among other films and TV shows. The clip of THE TERROR is particularly relevant since it comes at the end of the film, where Jack Nicholson kisses Sandra Knight and she begins to disintegrate in front of his eyes. The possessed Zoe is now able to hear (a telling scene is when a dog barks and she looks its way) and she calls Dane on a payphone one last time to tell him that she loves him (she is not possessed 100% of the time). Dane, in turn, calls the operator to see where the call originated from. Zoe first spots Jed, who happens to be a police officer. She follows him into a bar, where all of the patrons stop what they are doing to look at the deteriorating Zoe, Jed unaware she is behind him. She stabs Jed in the gut with a broken bottle and begins to pull out yards of his intestines while he is still alive. Zoe stops the bartender from shooting her by tossing a chair at him and killing him instead and then shoves a broken pool cue into another guy's eye when he tries to intervene. After pulling out nearly all of Jed's intestines (it's quite graphic), she finishes him off with a broken bottle to his face. Dane gets to the bar an hour late and when he goes to the payphone where Zoe made her call to him, he spots all the locals across the street and he asks them if they have seen Zoe (he shows them a photo). Trey's only response is, ""Sorry. We don't help n*****s."" When Dane mentions that she made a call from the phone across the road an hour earlier, they make West take them to her burial site to make sure she is actually dead. Surprisingly, Sheriff Holt (Daniel Knight) is sympathetic to Dane's plight (in other words, he's a decent human being), but he has trouble believing that a mute girl that probably weighs 110 pounds soaking wet could commit all the bloody carnage in the bar. When Grey Wolf gains consciousness, he sees that Zoe is gone (she is hiding in a farmer's barn, where she sees herself in the mirror and what she is becoming) and he goes looking for her to try and remove the Apache warrior possession.  Zoe discovers a room in the barn fill of all type of sharp instruments, including a bow and a good supply of arrows. The locals make it to Zoe's grave and find it empty, but West swears she was dead and Creed says a pack of coyotes probably dragged her away since her grave was so shallow. A short time later, Skeeter watches from the truck while Zoe shoots an arrow into Creed's leg and then riddles his body with arrows (including one to the crotch. Ouch!). Before Creed dies he manages to shoot Zoe once in the face (We then watch Zoe take her engagement ring off and all of the skin on the finger comes off with it. Yech!). She knows she doesn't have much time left on this Earth when she pulls the bandages off one of her arms (where she ripped it apart with the barb wire on the bed) and discovers the wound is crawling with maggots (a well done, if hard to watch, scene). Zoe goes back to Grey Wolf's trailer and he tells her if she actually wants revenge she better do it fast (There is a ritual Grey Wolf can perform to put Zoe to rest, but Zoe would rather have the revenge, as would anyone with a sense of justice. Since Zoe doesn't feel pain, why not give the people their just desserts?). Sheriff Holt finds Zoe's engagement ring in the barn and begins to think that Zoe is the killer since the barn stinks of death. Zoe leaves one final message on Dane's bathroom mirror that says ""Please forget me"" when the room fills up with steam from the hot water, but before he can run outside and catch up with Zoe, the remainder of the locals kidnap Dane (In true THE WARRIORS [1979] fashion, Cody yells out, ""Angel, we got your booooy!"" over and over, just like the scene with the beer bottles where David Patrick Kelly yells out, ""Warriors, come out and plaaay!"" in director Walter Hill's classic). Zoe shoots an arrow into Cody's neck (""What is in my neck?"") and a still-alive Cody jumps in the front seat of the truck with West and Dane in the bed of the truck. They can't believe they are seeing Zoe in such a decomposed state and still walking, so they drive off, but a quick running Zoe jumps into the bed of the truck and gets into a fight with West and his big knife, but how can you kill something that is already dead (Dane can't see any of this because he is in a sack)? West stabs her over and over with his knife to no effect, until he accidentally injures Dane in the sack with the knife. Zoe has had enough and rams West's head through the back window of the truck. She goes to stab West with his own knife, but a quick-thinking Trey slams on the brakes and Zoe goes flying over the front of the truck (it is well executed). Trey runs her body over with the truck, but when she gets up and screams, she scares the crap out of the rednecks and they drive away, still with Dane as a hostage. We are now in a warehouse, where Dane is tied to a chair and Trey's father (Peter Sherayko) and several survivalists (who have sold some automatic weapons to the locals) are waiting for Zoe to arrive. We watch Zoe patch her body up with plenty of duct tape (Is there nothing this product can't do?), while Cody still complains about the arrow in his neck (if they pull it out, he will surely bleed to death. The ancient Apache warrior leaves Zoe's body and gives her an ancient knife, tomahawk and a magical necklace (A mixture of CGI and practical effects and, I have to say, it wasn't half bad). The dastardly Trey tells Dane how they all took turns to assault his fiancee and West then killed her (he still doesn't believe that Zoe is dead). Sheriff Holt talks to Skeeter and he does the right thing and tells the Sheriff the whole sordid story (Skeeter never assaulted Zoe, but Trey and Jed were still his brothers). Cody is tired of waiting around with an arrow in his neck, so he steals a car and goes to drive to the hospital, but Zoe appears and throws a spear, whose tip is the ancient knife, right into Cody's head and the car goes flying over her body (a great stunt comprised of CGI and real action). Zoe begins to systematically kill the survivalists and the locals, using her new-found supernatural powers until only West and Trey are left. Zoe throws the tomahawk into West's chest and drags his body away while he is screaming. Trey finds West without a heart (Did he really have one?), as he sees Zoe eating it. Sheriff Holt shows up and Trey shoots him in the neck, but doesn't kill him. Dane finally realized that Zoe is dead because he sees her reflection in a window as she stands behind him. She goes to lovingly touch his shoulder, but leaves instead, walking past the still-alive Sheriff Holt (even in his state, he can't believe what he is seeing). Trey drives to Grey Wolf's trailer and wants to know if there is a way to stop this carnage, but Grey Wolf tells him the curse will only be finished when Trey is dead. Zoe visits Trey's mother and plants the tomahawk in her head. A guilt-ridden Skeeter has already killed himself by slitting his wrists with a box cutter. Zoe shows up at Grey Wolf's trailer and Zoe and Trey get into a chainsaw/tomahawk fight. Zoe cuts off one of Trey's hands and then hits him in the crotch with the tomahawk (Double ouch!!). While he is on his knees, Trey uses his only good hand and runs the chainsaw through Zoe's torso, but it has little effect on Zoe and she cuts Trey's head off with the tomahawk (I wonder if his skull will end up in that refrigerator?). When Dane shows up at Grey Wolf's place, he sees Trey's headless body and Zoe is trying to bury herself (just like in the finale of director Bob Clark's DEATHDREAM [1972], which this film shares many of the same qualities, which is not a bad thing at all). Dane lovingly rubs her cheek, pours gasoline on her and, before he lights the match, Zoe signs ""I Love You"". Dane lights the gasoline and his love burns to death. Remember this: Revenge may be sweet, but it usually comes with a big price.  Originally titled SAVAGED (a much more appropriate title, but in this politically correct-charged country, it would have been boycotted by some Native American organization, the same way they tried [and failed] to get the name of that football team, director/screenwriter/cinematographer/editor/sound editor/digital effects technician Michael S. Ojeda (whose only other fictional feature-length film was the well-received revenge drama LANA'S RAIN [2002]; he basically did nothing but TV documentaries, TV re-enactment series and short films between these two films) fills this film with many references to other films (It's a great film just for that fact alone. See how many tributes you can spot in this film.), but it is a great revenge film in it's own right, filled with many memorable sequences, some wonderful dialogue and good acting. The only thing that bothers me is that in films of this type, there always has to be a mentally handicapped person who wants nothing to do with violence but always is forced to get involved, but unlike most other films, that character kills himself here because of the guilt. In the end, he really is the only local with a conscience. The violence may seem a little too much from time to time, but when is violence not? Thankfully, Ojeda keeps the assault scenes to a minimum and focuses on the revenge and what it means to know you are dead, still love someone, but know there is only one way out. That's the underlining driving factor behind this film. Love is a powerful thing, but there are also more powerful things out there that trump it, like revenge. And this film dishes it out in spades. Both the physical effects (including Zoe's decomposing body and the arrow stuck in Cody's neck) and most of the digital effects are excellent (even the digital effect of the Apache warrior coming out of Zoe's body is done well) and there's a lot more to recommend here (such as the Sheriff not being one of the ""good old boys"" and actually taking Dane seriously), so my advice is to buy this one and skip the version shown on CHILLER. That version is just a ghost shell of the full version. My highest recommendation. Made in 2013, but not released on DVD in the U.S. until 2015. Also starring Ed Fletcher, Jason Gurwitz, Dan Kiefer, Bobby Field, Ernie Charles and Rick Mora as the injured Indian Zoe nearly hits with her car. An Uncork'd Entertainment DVD Release.

Would have given it 5 stars because the entire cast was great and made it believable. However, I'm tired of Hollywood making films about women being brutalized and raped, and I'm sick of the racism as well.

7012317,3,B00TKIJGDA,"**There may be spoilers.**

I originally saw the trailer for this flick when I was looking for a similar film some time ago.  The trailer looked great, so I decided to bookmark the movie for later viewing.  Last night, or I should say early this morning, I sat down and watched it in anticipation of something decent.  (I held no illusions that it was going to be anything stellar.)  I wasn't disappointed.

PREMISE

Say what you want about the whole of the film, but the premise is unique, although this doesn't imply that it's an effective one.  I happened to think that it was effective.  Here's what you have:  A young woman heading to see her fianc.  She gets derailed and has a terrible run-in with nefarious, racist fellows.  They end up sexually assaulting and killing her.  She comes back as a combination of an angry Native American warrior hell-bent on revenge for past wrongs and a young woman who is hell-bent on current wrongs happening to her.

There are a lot of unique things about this.  Notably, the protagonist is hearing impaired, which means she has no lines throughout the film, only unintelligible utterances and the usage of Sign Language.  Despite that she may really be hearing impaired, it's hard to pull off a film with a main character who can't talk or hear.  The director has to rely on a number of other elements to move the story along.  Here, you don't hear the typical screams of a woman who is captured.  This works out, though, as the character has nothing to rely on but unbridled anger and frustration.

ACTING

Everyone except the fianc was credible.  The racist hillbillies that are the antagonists were played exceptionally well.  You really got the sense that these guys were taking a day off from a cross burning to torment people in their small village.

The standout was the protagonist.  Not only was she attractive, but she played up the other factors that make a character interesting and engaging.  The character is someone passionate about taking pictures of desolate environments, of the desert.  You can feel this through her.  When she's being tormented by her captors, you feel that she's genuinely fearful of her life.  When she moves into vengeance mode, you can tell she's ticked off and ready to kill wantonly.

Where you call into question her credibility is when she's in action scenes.  She can't fight worth a lick, but they have her doing martial arts-like moves, and they look ludicrous.  What's worse is even her stunt double seems ridiculous in her fighting.  This is the one area that professionalism went out the window in favor of unbridled violence.  (One could argue that she's not a martial artist and so you have to cut her some slack.)

Coming back to the antagonists, these guys are truly depraved individuals.  Visually, they're disgusting to look at: dirty, messy, unwashed for days on end.  Verbally, they're vile.  They copiously use the N-word toward the fianc.  But they play this role so well that you really believe them.  When they use the N-word, they actually sound like they have been using it pejoratively for their entire lives.  When they're bashing, physically and verbally, Native Americans, you feel these guys really hate them.  When I walk away from a film hating a certain character because I believe the character is vile, I know that I am watching a decent actor.

The one character that didn't do anything for me was the fianc.  He was nice to look at, sure, but his acting wasn't.  His love and concern for the protagonist strained credibility.  When's he captured and finds out this his fiance is on a killing spree--even after being told by the racists that she had been raised from the dead--he spends the rest of the time screaming out support for her to kill them, not even showing an inkling of confusion about how a formerly dead person could be exacting revenge.  When he yelled, ""Get 'em, baby!"" I dismissed him.

DECENT INTO ABSURDITY

Admittedly, the premise of the film is absurd, but it has the opportunity to turn the movie into something interesting, and it did that for the most part.  However, as the flick progresses, you start to see how absurd everything is.  Each minute that passes, credibility wanes.  An example?  A young woman who understandably wants payback for being assaulted, but who oddly enough joins up with a long-dead Native American warrior killed by the family line of the racist antagonists.  Why did this Native American spirit wait this long to exact revenge?  Why did he choose to pair up with this woman?  Early in the film, another Native American character was killed in the protagonist's car.  Why not have him take out the revenge?

The unfortunate climax was when we see the invincible young woman having a chainsaw fight with the main antagonist.  This is a woman who took out every one of the racists that assaulted her, and who did so in gruesome fashions, without breaking a sweat or batting an eye.  This is also an antagonist who spends the majority of the film running for his life from this ticked-off woman, but who suddenly develops the mental and physical fortitude of He-Man to fight off this crazy, demon-possessed woman, and who actually manages to kill her shortly before he's killed.  Seriously?  A chainsaw from nowhere?  A man who knows how to wield one like a champ?  Get real.

SUMMARY

Great premise that slowly is undone as the movie unravels.  The characters keep the film from sinking into a black hole of ridiculousness, but just barely.  Still, you have to give props for a director and characters who are successful in keeping everything plodding along enough to keep you watching.  Is this a film I would recommend to others?  Sure, if they are horror-film fans.  If you must write home about this flick, make sure you capture both the good and the impressive level of bad as well.",1443312000,,5858,4.747765640516385

The fact that she is completely okay that she has the ghost of a murdered Native American chief in her just make you root for her more and more.
-Spoiler-
When I learned that Zoe's body was not going to make which meant that she would not be able to marry her devoted fiance and live out her life, I got the idea that the ending would do me no good but I was surprised to find out that the ending was quiet satisfying. The Chief gets what he wants, Zoe does not go without her revenge, and Dane gets to say goodbye to his fiance before releasing her and the chief from her decomposing body.

RRRREVENGE! Superb grindhouse gory morality rampage with uncountable twists!! It's tough to describe my shock and thrills, since I was so ready to be disappointed. I only cringed at 3 really bad lines, a record for me and my love/hate  grindhouse genre thing...But the rest of the film was, again, for this genre, just about perfectly paced, intriguing me scene after scene, with its own flow and absolutely unique story. Revenge on all the rapists and racists! GO GO RIOT GRRRLZ!!! Extra kudos to the lead actress, who overcame a lot of physical challenges and an amazing bloody fistfull of plot twists.

Most of the possessed riot grrrl fight scenes were clean, believable in context, and, heck, fun to watch. The supernatural twists --there were several-- never defied what I've come to understand of both shamanism, and seemed to align with my admittedly very limited understanding of some tribal medicine ways. While I have a fraction of American Indian blood, it's not Apache, and so I don't claim to know what I don't know. The big difference in death tabus and prohibitions vary widely, for instance. But this was a story that was told with at least some respect, and lots of punishment given out to those who embraced violence against women and tribal people.",1440460800,,1294,4.931192660550459

You immediately fall in love with Zoe and absolutely detest West, Trey, and their goons - a sign of excellent acting. Furthermore, Marc Anthony Samuel (Zoe's Boyfriend) had some epic quotes in the movie. ""Avenged"" is basically torture porn, but the director was tasteful when depicting the horrors Zoe endures.

This gets old. In fact its downright insulting and had they made this the same way about any other group but white males, Obama himself would be blaming this video for the next muslim attack on a US embassy. It was an OK story, bascially a variation on a zombie film with a dash of amer-Indian revenge against the evil white man.

Zoe visits her older sister and receives her inheritance of a classic car.  We learn Zoe is deaf-mute.  She is, of course, an attractive blonse female. Her sister worries about her and asks that she keep to the highway.  Of course, she does not.  She stops frequently to stop; and send selfies to her boyfriend (a supportive afro american male).  She runs into racist redneck types in New Mexico (who have southern accents and don't resemble anyone I know, let alone have seen, in New Mexico, but just go with it).  She witnesses the brutal murder of two native americans and is then assaulted and raped by said rednecks.  Who keep her as a plaything until they decide she is likely to be more problematic -- being a pretty white girl and not one of the locals they have disappeared -- so one of the creepy brothers kills her and dumps her in a shallow grave.

She does not stay dead, being found by the kindly local Indian medicine man who tries to help her.  She almost comes back to life but ends up possessed by the spirit of an Apache chief murdered long ago.

The movie does a nice job with initial uncertainty -- is she dead or possibly possessed?  The answer is that she is both dead and possessed but the main point of the plot is vengence (both the girl and the dead chief have plenty of motivation)

Basically, this is an above average revenge flick with some supernatural overtones.  Worth the watch",1438387200,16,1433,4.461538461538462

It is definitely ""I Spit on Your Grave"" meets some manner of resurrected dead film. The gore, rape, racism and violence is hard to stomach if you prefer more subtle spectrums of the horror genre, but it also makes it impossible to not laugh out loud in righteous retribution as well as empathize with the appropriate characters when things finally start going in the ""proper direction.""  How this film almost managed to move me to tears can only be attributed to the cast of characters and their predominantly incredible acting.  The script is mostly well done and certainly has a narrative quality to it.  I wouldn't be surprised if a fair deal of inspiration for parts of this film were inspired a good bit by video games and it shows in a way that I think gamers can appreciate. The special-effects are primarily well done, though leave a little to be desired where the budget required it, but whatever the budget WAS, they did a fantastic job allocating their funds.  Even if you do generally destest too much graphic gore and human torture in your horror films and lean towards the more psychological, this movie does a fantastic job at the emotive and keeping the monsters human when they need to be human, and the humans monsters when they are clearly monsters. Go ahead and kill your time with this one or fall in love if you love back-from-the-dead revenge horror.

OLD 1-STAR REVIEW...

First of all, let me apologize in advance. THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIE!!!!!! But there was no other way for me to warn viewers who purchase this as an instant video through Amazon! I realize that my one-star review will unfairly downgrade the rating, (not by much, but it still counts,) but I can't give it any other review since I was unable to watch the movie. Hopefully, by warning Amazon customers, and possibly saving them money, they'll consider this a worthy reason.

I PURCHASED this streaming video, but can NOT watch it. The audio track is severely messed up!! My audio track is several seconds off, making if appear HORRIBLY dubbed. (I'm not the only one with this problem.) I've tried restarting the video MANY times, plus I've even skipped ahead, ANSD  rebooting my system... But nothing helped. I don't havea problem watching dubbed movies, but normally, the dubbed voices happen at the exact moment of dialog, so it's not difficult to follow. This is so far off that, at times, it's impossible to sell who's talking! Also, many other purchasers (or renters) have NO AUDIO AT ALL!! There may have been others who haven't had any issues with the melon MM, but if you purchase or rent this video, you're taking a HUGE gamble!! (Read other one-star reviews and you'll see what I mean.) I'd LOVE to watch this video, but the audio track is REALLY BAD!!! (Again, maybe not all viewers had this problem, but this was my experience, as well as many others, so I thought it only fair to warn people.) If I were you, I'd wait to see if they include this title as a Prime video so that you don't waste your money. You may very well be one of the lucky ones and not have a problem at all. But why take a chance? If you want to see it badly enough, it might be worth your while to rent it elsewhere.

Again, my apologies for leaving such a low rating, but many people will skip to the one-star ratings to see why people disliked the movie. By giving it one-star, hopefully I caught your attention before you waste your money.
___________________________________________________

NEW 3-STAR REVIEW...

Again, everything I said above remains true. My Amazon Streaming Video Copy is worthless!! But I DID finally rent a physical copy, and this is my new review...

I give it a solid 3 STARS!!!

After FINALLY being able to watch it, (no thanks to Amazon) I found it to be enjoyable. Yes, it stretches the imagination a LOT, but that's what I like about it! The MC comes back from the DEAD and KICKS ASS!!! She is truly a STRONG female lead!! And even though she's suffered horribly, (which I absolutely HATED, but something terrible had to happen, otherwise what would drive her to seek revenge?), she not only returns from the dead (with a little help), but she DESTROYS her abductors and rapists!! And they absolutely got what was coming to them. (Unfortunately, at a very heart-breaking expense, but this story is NOT typical, and does not have a happily-ever-after theme. It's just not possible.)

So... after all that I went through with Amazon AND with having to spend MORE money to RENT it, I still managed to enjoy the movie. Some scenes--especially her abduction, abuse, and rape--were anything BUT enjoyable, and quite honestly sickened me. But what I DID like was the fact that they got what they deserved! And SHE handed out the punishment in a truly kick-ass way!

To me, 3 STARS is a very fair rating for a pretty good movie!",1435622400,,3631,4.587962962962963

7012518,3,B00TKIJGDA,"This movie is interesting as the protagonist is female.  Its mostly predicable, as most revenge movies are, but it is the blood thirstiness that you pick up on especially for a female lead.  The ancillary characters are for the most part uninteresting and carry no weight except to be victims.  The lead baddy, Rodney Rowland, as the redneck anti-Indian, anti-black character is perfect.  Everyone else in his group is just window dressing.  The Korean vet is jarringly too young which makes the whole segment that he is in seem too contrived.

Its a shame that the movie could not gather additional funding.  What they did with what they had was exceptional.  Another million or two and this could have been another No One Lives.  To compare it to the Crow does it a disservice.

I hope that this feature will lead Michael S. Ojeda to better things.

7012532,4,B00TKIJGDA,"The story that Ojeda has created around this supernatural transformation of a sexual assault victim is powerful, compelling, and emotional. Avenged becomes a complex multi-layered story with characters rich in dimension. The acting and directing are quality. Michael S. Ojeda is a true talent with the gift of telling a really high-octane, and twisted story. The characters and situations are emotionally driven and effectively pull on you to feel and relate to both the horrors of man and the suffering of humanity.

The special effects are pretty awesome. Some moments seem to fall a bit flat when it comes to realism, but for the most part Avenged will excite any gore, and blood thirsty horror fan. There is some CGI mixed in but Ojeda seems to have an understanding of what is a healthy balance of its use. The CGI is blended effortlessly in most of the violence-rich scenes. Overall Avenged is a worthy supernatural-exploitation mashup that entertains on pretty much every horror level.",1430870400,,992,5.048780487804878

7012545,4,B00TKIJGDA,"Zoe (Amanda Adrienne) is a deaf girl who inherits a GTO from her father. She is obsessed with selfies and her cell phone camera. She travels out west to see her boyfriend when she runs into a group of western ""yahoos"" who hunt Native Americans. She becomes their prisoner. Using the pictures she sent him, her boyfriend (Marc Anthony Samuel) retraces her steps in an attempt to locate her.

The film turns into a very different ""I Spit on Your Grave."" The film includes an interesting ""tug-o-war"" with a man's intestines.

Well done, well written indie horror/slasher/revenge film for those who like that type of movie.",1429228800,,619,4.830188679245283
7012546,4,B00TKIJGDA,"The story itself is pretty familiar. Someone is travelling alone across the deserted area, where he/she gets involved with a gang of murderous locals. The protagonist may be brutalized, tortured, or even killed perhaps, but somehow comes back to get even with those who made him/her suffer. Its a typical revenge story, told so many times before.

In Michael S. Ojedas thriller Avenged (aka. Savaged), a young and beautiful traveler Zoe (Amanda Adrienne) is the heroine, who, after horrible events, returns from death as a sort of zombie fighter possessed by the spirit of a vengeful Apache warrior. Im not kidding.

The film is essentially an escapist horror with lots of graphic violence and gory deaths, though its subplot includes the heroines fianc&eacute;e Dane (Marc Anthony Samuel) looking for his missing love, giving a romantic and poignant touch to the bloody revenge story.

You may talk about the films subtexts if you like (just like in a cult classic I Spit on Your Grave), but to me Avenged is a revenge thriller with a twist and pretty entertaining.",1429228800,5,1066,4.977528089887641
7012547,4,B00TKIJGDA,"The four-star rating is for fellow horror fans. General audiences might like Avenged well enough to creep them out at Halloween perhaps. Or, remember, horror movies are always just great for late nights when you are drunk, high, or simply solitary.

Avenged--a.k.a. Savaged--is good. I give it a 6/10. I wonder about the title change after Savaged's festival run. Perhaps, there is a story to the redaction. Perhaps, there is not. As expected, Savaged (a movie about a white woman suddenly possessed by a vengeful Apache) dares to be politically-incorrect. For example, the misogynistic white-supremacist scumbags tormenting Ms. 45-2015 (who will be avenged) and the community talk and act like the degenerates and racists that they are. Think Johnny Firecloud bad guys, not Disney's Pocahontas. Sometimes, horror and exploitation benefit by not pulling punches. Sometimes, they are good, pertinent gothic morality tales thereby. Sometimes, they simply exploit their sordid elements are entertainment and money. I must compliment Avenged's approach to sexual violence (i.e. rape), however. The viewer encounters a blood-curdling rape scene, but the scene is not overly sexualized. Rather, Avenged focuses on the heroine's gruesome revenge over its runtime.

So, I like Savaged's premise and approach. Perhaps, you will too. The execution, however, is inconsistent. For example, the film has three actors giving strong performances and a bunch of actors who are, well, ""distracting."" On one hand, Savaged's practical gore effects are bad-ass. They will give you the willies. On the other, the CGI effects are sometimes appallingly cheap and cheesy. They give you the giggles. And, the story really engages a viewer and makes him think--except when it has bad continuity errors and dumb developments.

But, as indicated, Avenged gets my overall recommendation for horror and exploitation fans. The on-line community has discussed this project for awhile. Perhaps, see it for that reason.",1428883200,9,1985,5.501639344262295

7012558,1,B00TKIJGDA,"Wow, how original. I really like when filmmakers dig down deep and come up with something we've never seen before. Here's the brilliant plot: we have white rednecks who kill Native Americans for no reason, but wait it gets more original. Our heroine is white and has a black fianc, so this really makes the white rednecks mad, so they rape and kill her, but wait it gets more original, one of the killers is a local sheriff. Eventually, we have our heroine come back from the dead as an Apache killer, but we've had so much originality at this point I had to pause the movie just to take it all in. I'm really looking forward to the sequel where our heroine comes back from the dead and seeks revenge on more redneck killers who kill everyone in town for no reason.

I am always amazed at how filmmakers find funding for stupid s*** like this. I'd like to sit in on the movie pitch where the idiot who wrote this actually convinces another idiot to fund it. But who am I to talk, I watched it.",1427500800,7,993,4.281914893617022

7012573,4,B00TKIJGDA,"Originally titled Savaged, but now goes by the title Avenged.

This is a violent Grindhouse style horror that bleeds, somewhat the concept of, I Spit on your Grave, The Last House on the Left and all those others, but also mixes the concept of a supernatural element. The concept of the raped and brutalized woman has been done a thousand times before, and so, it is unoriginal, but don't go into it thinking that way, because I felt this movie, really came together as a solid supernatural rape, revenge tale. Yes, this has the plot of a raped woman/revenge reality of the 70's and 80's and even today, but that is not the whole plot. It adds a unique and interesting and in my viewpoint an awesome fresh concept to this tired and overdone story.

The makeup, special effects and gore is top notch and utterly fantastic. They do an amazing job in that department. It looked real, and even spots made me feel, the hurt and pain. The violence is brutal, and the supernatural element to the plot, was spot on interesting, and very unique, and original through the Native American spirit reality.

It's about freaking time the white man pays. Oh wait I am white. Well the white man of the past deserves the revenge of all those Natives, lied to, and fallen, to the brutality of the evil racist, white man of the past.
