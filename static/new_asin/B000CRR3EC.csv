2471192,2,B000CRR3EC,"My poor rating has nothing to do with the adaptations (which I thought were well done and atmospheric.) It's always a pleasure to see David Suchet as Poirot. On the contrary, I have a beef with the presentation on these DVDs. They were clearly cut to fit into A&E time slots - with annoying dips to black in the middle of music cues - and censored for language. At one point a character exclaims ""God Dammit, Poirot"" but the sound drops out where he says ""God."" That's all well and fine for A&E's standards and practices, but when I spend the money on a DVD, I want the full length, uncensored presentation as it was meant to be seen - without artificial breaks in the continuity for commercials. Shame on you, A&E - you can do much better!",1150848000,56,740,4.369565217391305
2471193,5,B000CRR3EC,"This Poirot set is as good as, if not better than the earlier films. 'After the Funeral' is the best of the four films.

First class acting.

Brilliant picture quality.

Good sound.

Some fancy 'keeping with the times' camera-shots.

David Suchet- brillianto!

The plots unfold clearly with no ambiguity, inspite of retaining their maturity.

2471194,3,B000CRR3EC,"These 4 dvd's----Mystery of the Blue Train; After the Funeral; Taken at the Floor; Cards on the Table----were a disappointment because of the expectation that follows all the previous in the superb & highly enjoyable Piorot series (all of which we have.)  Firstly, Miss Lemon, Hastings, and Japp are missing, which is a huge loss, as they inform the personal aspect of Piorot.  Granted, they are also not present in the novels these DVD's cover, but as there is already so much license with the the novels, they could certainly have been included-----and continued the dimensionality of showing Piorot's personal life.  These supporting characters gave continuity, humor, and soul to the shows, so are sadly missed.  Piorot also has a new flat (albeit it appears to be in the same building) with no reason given----------so dedicated viewers are left to feel as if they have missed a DVD that would have explained all these changes.

Equally disturbing is the new direction/format: the weird camera cuts, the jumping in editing--------as if some new director or editor is right out of film school and could not wait to try new tricks.  Very amateurish.

And the characters------save the always brilliant and accurate David Suchet-------seem charactitures, grossly over-acting and so sterotypical.  The beauty of the Christie novels and the previous Piorot DVDs is that the characters were so ""normal"" and believable----and such brilliant actors----that the murder and mayhem that follows is in such contrast.  Isn't that Christie's whole theme: that underneath normal life is a deep, dark side.  Well, most of the characters in these new DVDs are so theatrical is all comes off as summer stock in the provinces.

Please bring back the old Piorot, the old cast, and the old direction and editing!!! PLEASE!!!",1150502400,21,1807,5.154109589041096
2471195,1,B000CRR3EC,"After the wonderful quality of the earlier Poirot films starring David Suchet, it is very disappointing to see these poorly adapted productions. While Mr. Suchet plays Poirot with his usual perfection the pacing of the stories develops unevenly and drags frequently. The plots have been shredded to give the supporting actors more to do with their characters but to the point of destroying the original plot. The characters are no longer human but caricatures. In one scene a male servant gropes a female servant under the dim eyes of the aged butler. In another scene a ""party girl"" character rescues a friend from an attack by leaping on the back of the attacker and biting the attacker's neck, grinning with wild eyed abandon like some sort of vampire.  It confuses and distracts from the story line as do so many other unnecessary additions in these adaptations, especially when the relevant point is made again and again. The overall mood is erratic and disturbing, even the sets seem overly loud and unpleasant. There is no charm, no gentle humor and certainly no understanding of human folly. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend anyone who really loves Agatha Christie's work purchase these severely flawed adaptations.",1149811200,41,1224,5.08955223880597
2471196,4,B000CRR3EC,"These are a great addition to any Poirot fan's collection.  However, A&E released these DVDs with the edited audio for TV soundtrack so all the curse words are silenced.  This is especially noticeable in ""The Mystery of the Blue Train"".  Overall a little annoying but it doesn't spoil the great stories.",1149292800,6,303,4.901960784313726
2471197,3,B000CRR3EC,"As you would expect, when novels by an author are being considered for dramatization the best ones are selected first.  As the number being dramatized increases the novels left to chose from are less adaptable to dramatization or are not as well written or have plot defects.

This is what has happened with Poirot.  After many dozen dramatizations the bottom of the barrel is being scraped for material.  Another problem with these is that the characters, even though wealthy, are portrayed as culturally lower class.

That said, the technical details of the dramatizations are very good.  The period costumes are correct, the casting makes the characters  believable.

One disappointment is that Poirot is on his own and his three sidekicks from other episodes, like Captain Hastings, are not in the program.",1149120000,16,810,5.129770992366412
2471198,5,B000CRR3EC,"Iam a great fan of agatha christie's books particularly those

featuring hercule poirot. And of all the actors playing poirot,David suchet is the best. And the adaptation from the novels are quite good.",1146528000,10,202,5.121212121212121
2471199,5,B000CRR3EC,"In the latest installment of A&E Network's Poirot film series comes four new mysteries based upon the classic Agatha Christie novels that until now had never been produced before for television or the silver screen.  Hence, this is the ""Classic Crimes Collection,"" starring David Suchet as the formidable Belgian sleuth, Hercule Poirot.

Before delving into the four new titles, please note that this glossy A&E series thus far does not resemble the earlier British-produced TV episodes and films of the 1990's that David Suchet starred in as Poirot.  These newer A&E films move seemingly at a much brisker pace and employ some flashy camera techniques, but retain only a modest helping of the traditional British flavor that made Suchet's earlier Poirot efforts feel so genuine in representing the 1930's and 1940's England.  Still, no matter your opinion of which style is superior (the British productions vs. A&E), Suchet's timeless portrayal of Hercule Poirot makes both imminently entertaining for mystery lovers of all ages.

First up in this collection is ""The Mystery of the Blue Train,"" as Poirot delves into the baffling death of a young heiress aboard a train bound for the French Riviera.

Next is ""After the Funeral,"" in which a wealthy patriarch has been murdered, but Poirot's subsequent investigation only leads to yet another fiendish murder with possibly more to come.

""Cards on the Table"" (a personal Christie favorite of ours) pits four of Christie's famous detectives (Poirot, Inspector Battle, Colonel Race, & Ariadne Oliver) in a race against time vs. four 'perfect' murderers that leads them from the bridge table into a deadly game of wits as the villain won't be content with just one victim.

Lastly, there comes ""Taken at the Flood,"" where Poirot encounters a young, enigmatic widow who has become entangled in a web of deceit, blackmail, and murder after her husband has been killed in the London Blitz.

The bonus features evidently include a bibliography of Christie's Poirot novels, as well as some standard biographical information about the author and actor David Suchet.

At its current sale price, this collection of Suchet's latest Poirot films, appropriately enough, is an absolute steal!",1143244800,231,2228,5.198324022346369

2471205,2,B000CRR3EC,"I usually dislike film adaptations of books because so often there are unnecessary, destructive and just plain silly changes that alter the tone, fabric and nature of the story.  Sadly, the otherwise excellent Poirot series has fallen victim to frivolous and often ruinous changes.

The Mystery of the Blue Train:  A simply awful story, Christie herself hated it and considered it her worst story.  The film adaptation is a morass of ill-timed comedy and overplayed characters (and hairdos...poor Lenox).  Elliot Gould overacts as always and the not-so-subtle changes to the story (Lady Tamplin & co meeting Katherine on the train);  the ridiculous juxtaposition of the party at the villa with the tragedy) made for a terrible storytelling.  Also the casting of Knighton and Mason was horribly off -- the two actors, fine in other roles, were all wrong for the parts.

After The Funeral made several unnecessary changes and some that actually benefited the story..  (Cora's name was Lansconet, not Gallacio.  Her husband was dead, not alive and, far from being a world famous art appraiser, Lansconet had been a 3rd rate artist).  Characters were eliminated or condensed and Mrs. Leo Abernathy was sullied in this version, creating drama for her son George, and a side mystery involving missing papers and a substitute will.  Cousin Susan is unmarried in this version, which imho improved the story.

 Despite these many changes, this production is well acted, beautifully filmed and turned out very well.  In particular, standout performances by Lucy Punch and  a chilling turn by the brilliant Monica Dolan as Miss Gilchrist.

There has been an unfortunate penchant for the producers of this series to inject homosexual subplots, undertones and relationships where none was originally conceived, included or written by the author.  The only story I can think of where a homosexual relationship was even implied was in A Murder Is Announced"" (Murgatroid and Hinchfliffe).  Unfortunately this trend continues in this series with the thoroughly butchered ""Cards on the Table"" -- a story that was so mangled in film as to be unrecognizable.  Mrs. Lorrimer was not killed!  This change caused the omission of one of Poirot's best denouements!  Rhoda and Anne's roles are completely reversed... why?  The very motivation for the murders ... changed!  Why?  No reason.  This is a complete pass.

Taken at the Flood, a horrible story to begin with, was not much improved by film.  Christie was a hopeless romantic, but absolutely nothing on earth could make me believe that anyone would find David attractive in the least, let alone, Lynne.  Overall, the story was forgettable;  the abortion bit was gratuitous and unnecessary;  why can't filmmakers just tell the story as written?  In addition, the title, taken from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, refers to how sometimes, one man's tragedy is another's opportunity.  The authors of this film version either missed that, ignored it or just decided to discard this main theme and change things so that the antagonist makes their own fortune.  NOT.  Probably they should have changed the title as well, because as told on film, the title was incongruent, but not as the author intended.

Overall I give this set a C- and such a high rating only because of the authentic sets and costumes.",1424131200,2,3329,5.111317254174397

2471239,5,B000CRR3EC,"The numbers of reviews submitted for the various packages of David Suchet's portrayal of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian detective Hercules Poirot is testament enough as to its popularity, with many going into considerable detail about each episode covered.

I'm not about to clog up the reviews with more of the same. If you know who Poirot is there's no need, and if you don't, many of these other great reviews will fill you in nicely. I simply wish to say that each meticulously portrays the time period (1920s to 1940s before the series reaches its end) as only British productions can, and with actors who do not overplay their roles in sticking as closely as possible to Agatha Christie's books.

As some have noted, the original episodes have more of an Art Deco and often brighter and less-brooding look to them with the semi-regular characters of his aide, Captain Arthur Hastings (Hugh Fraser), his secretary Miss Felicity Lemon (Pauline Moran), and Scotland Yard Chief Inspector James Harold Japp (Philip Jackson), each of whom more or less faded from Christie's books after entering the mid- to late-1930s.

These later episodes, some of which were produced by the A&E Network but still stuck flawlessly to the period in appearance, began to take on a darker side in their storylines (as did her books), with the only recurring characters being George, his valet, and detective fiction writer Ariadne Oliver (played by the brilliant actress Zo Wannamaker).

The only episodes not yet available on DVD are those of the final season, which were filmed the past year - Elephants Can Remember, The Big Four, The Labours Of Hercules, Dead Man's Folly, and Curtain. The last, which brings our favourite detective, now wheelchair-ridden, back to Styles (now a retirement residence), but where it all began, also sees his death.

I have them all to date, and can't wait for these to be broadcast and then finally made available on DVD.",1364428800,,1942,4.963076923076923

2471251,3,B000CRR3EC,"The ""Poirot Classic Crimes Collection"" includes four 90-minute films from Series 10 of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" that originally aired on Britain's ITV in 2006: ""The Mystery of the Blue Train"", ""Cards on the Table"", ""After the Funeral"", and ""Taken at the Flood"". This is the season that Poirot got a new apartment, still in Whitehaven Mansions, but decorated with deeply colored, heavy furnishings, apparently chosen for their sharp angles. It is also the season that writers introduced a peculiar religiosity to the adaptations. Poirot seems a font of Catholic guilt, which he imposes on whomever he thinks deserves a dose. It's distasteful, and it makes Poirot into a vicious little man in some scenes in ""After the Funeral"" and ""Taken at the Flood"", the two weaker films.

""The Mystery of the Blue Train"" and ""Cards on the Table"" are better. The former is a particularly enjoyable train mystery, the latter one of Christie's more unconventional plots. ""Cards on the Table"" introduces Zo Wannamaker as Poirot's friend, the mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver. She's terrific. We need the comic relief with Poirot in a self-righteous snit all the time. But both mysteries suffer from salacious and superfluous subplots added by the screenwriters that do nothing but undermine the stories' strengths. I'm on the fence between 3 and 4 stars for the set, because two of the mysteries have considerable appeal in spite of their flaws. The A&E DVDs (2006) do not offer subtitles, but each has a brief text bio of David Suchet, Agatha Christie, and Hercule Poirot. They mysteries are:

In ""The Mystery of the Blue Train"", Katherine Grey (Georgina Rylance) has recently inherited a large sum of money and with it the attentions of many long lost relatives. Her cousin Lady Tamplin (Lindsay Duncan) has invited Katherine to visit her on the French Riviera. She is to take ""Le train bleu"" from London to Nice, as is Hercule Poirot, who befriends Katherine at their London hotel. Also on the train is Ruth Kettering (Jaime Murray), daughter of American oil tycoon Rufus Van Aldin (Elliot Gould), who intends a tryst with her lover Count de la Roche (Oliver Milburn), as she seeks a divorce from husband Derek (James D'Arcy). Lady Tamplin, her brash daughter Lenox (Alice Eve), and forth husband Corky (Tom Harper) surprise Katherine on the train. Ruth is found bludgeoned to death, her invaluable and infamous gemstone, the Heart of Fire, missing.

In ""Cards on the Table"", Poirot is invited by the sinister Mr. Shaitana (Alexander Siddig) to his home for a dinner party, as is Poirot's friend Ariadne Oliver (Zo Wannamaker). They are joined by police Superintendent Wheeler (David Westhead), Colonel Hughes (Robert Pugh) of the Secret Service, and four other guests. After dinner, Mr. Shaitana divides the guests into two groups of four and shows them to bridge tables in separate rooms. Four guests, all sleuths of some description, are in one room, and they wonder what the other group may have in common. At the end of the evening, as the guests say their goodbyes, it is discovered that Shaitana has been murdered, a stiletto driven through his heart while he slept. The four guests who played bridge in that room are the suspects, and the four sleuths must find the killer.

In ""After the Funeral"", Poirot is asked by the lawyer Gilbert Entwhistle (Robert Bathurst) to investigate the family of his client, a Mr. Richard Abernethie, who recently died. Entwhistle read Richard's will with all the family present. To everyone's surprise, Richard instructed that his estate be sold and the proceeds divided among his 5 living relatives: brother Timothy (Benjamin Whitrow), sister Cora, nieces Rosamund (Fiona Glascott) and Susannah (Lucy Punch), and sister-in-law Helen (Geraldine James). Everyone had expected his fortune to go to George (Michael Fassbender), Richard's favorite nephew. The day after, the eccentric Cora, an artist and collector looked after by her companion Miss Gilcrist (Monica Dolan), is gruesomely murdered in her bed with a hatchet.

In ""Taken at the Flood"", Poirot is invited to the wedding of Lynn Marchmont (Amanda Dogue), who has returned from charitable work in Africa to marry Dowley Cloade (Patrick Baladi). The Cloade family are hard up for money. Wealthy Gordon Cloade died when his Mayfair apartment exploded due to an apparent gas leak. Only his young wife Rosaleen (Eva Birthistle) and her brother David Hunter (Eliot Cowan) survived. Gordon had been benefactor to his family, but Rosaleen, who inherited his fortune, is not so generous. Brother David jealously guards her fortune and won't allow her to help the Cloades. When rumor gets around that Rosaleen's first husband might still be alive, thus invalidating her marriage to Gordon, the relatives want Poirot to find out if it's true.",1320451200,2,4817,5.092405063291139

2471320,4,B000CRR3EC,"This set, ""Agatha Christie's Poirot - Classic Crimes Collection,"" consists of four of Dame Agatha's Poirot novels dramatized at TV feature length.  The four novels are ""The  Mystery of the Blue Train"" (1928), ""Cards on the Table"" (1936), ""Taken at the Flood"" (1948) and ""After the Funeral"" (1953).  Four other novels are dramatized in the companion set, ""Agatha Christie's Poirot - The New Mysteries Collection.""  The two sets display the output of the new A&E production team.

The new series diverge from the old in a number of ways.  They concentrate on Christie's novel-length works rather than her short stories.  Far more important to Amazon reviewers, though, seems to be the change in casting.  The dim but endearing Captain Hastings, the hyper-efficient Miss Lemon and that stolid plod, Chief Inspector Japp are all gone.  We find Poirot alone in his new, smaller, gloomier, distinctly less impressive flat--although he's apparently still in the same building.  Some reviewers note that the new scripts make references to modern sexual sensibilities in ways that certainly, unquestionably, indubitably did not appear in Dame Aggie's writings.  Typical reactions among those who mention this change involve one or all of dismay, disgust and disdain.  Others have drawn attention to production values for the new series.  One reviewer put it this way: ""[T]he production value of the films has gone through the roof.  Simply put, these are the best looking Poirot films made so far, particularly with regards to `film moment' shots and the use of color in regards to theme.""  Finally, there has been the obvious effect of all-devouring time; the now portly Suchet is sixty-ish and he looks it.

Let's consider that point, the older Poirot.  In 1920, Hercule Poirot appeared in Agatha Christie's first book, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles,"" a novel set in the middle of the First World War.  Captain Hastings, wounded on the Western Front, is on leave to recover back in England.  He happens to meet an odd little man named Hercule Poirot (a name plainly impossible for any self-respecting Englishman to pronounce correctly.)  Poirot is described as an elderly Belgian refugee who is a retired policeman.  Considering the events that took place in Belgium in the late summer of 1914, it must be assumed that he retired no later than the first half that year.  If Poirot retired at sixty--Christie writing at age 30 would probably have considered that to be elderly--he was born no later than 1854.  If at sixty-five, then 1849.  The earlier his retirement, the earlier his birth date.

Poirot's career in England stretched from the horrors of the Western Front to what he and his creator clearly regarded as the only slightly less baleful era of rock 'n roll.  For convenience, the original series was notionally set in 1935.  1937 seems to be the date for this series, considering that the name of a certain Mrs Simpson appears in the newspapers.  In 1937, Hercule Poirot must have been at least 83 years old.  All things considered, David Suchet was and still remains entirely too young for the part.

In 1916, Agatha Miller Christie was thinking about writing a book for pin money. (Monetary considerations aside, her older sister had made a bet with her that she couldn't do it!)  She and her dashing husband Archie Christie were bright young things, but on their beam ends financially.  She once wrote a self-pitying letter in which she complained she could afford only two servants.  She decided to write a mystery.  At the time, there was only one true pattern for a detective and its name was S. Holmes, still very much a living literary figure, with twelve stories of his Canon yet to be written.  After collecting a set of galling rejections, Agatha's first book, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" and Hercule Poirot finally saw print in 1920.

Holmes had a biographer named Watson, plodding colleagues at Scotland Yard, beginning with Inspector Lestrade, and a landlady-housekeeper, Mrs Hudson.  Following the set pattern, Christie gave Poirot his biographer in Captain Hastings--the complete boob that Watson NEVER was--and he introduced Inspector Japp.  Later, Poirot would find his London flat and enjoy the ministrations of Miss Lemon, a background figure in all but a single short story.

In the older TV series, Hastings got into everything.  Miss Lemon's role expanded beyond anything in Christie's writings.  All police detectives combined into Chief Inspector Japp.  All this, I presume, to humanize the little Belgian detective and to ease the endless task of explaining plot points.

In 1926, Christie hit the big time with her seventh book, ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.""  She was acknowledged as the great successor to Conan Doyle.  But Hastings wasn't even in ""Ackroyd.""  She realized that she had no need to follow Holmes anymore, so she sent the now-tedious Hastings off to molt in some remote South American exile, bringing him back only on a rare sentimental occasion.

In this Hastings-, Lemon- and Japp-free series, the new producers have done no more than follow Christie's lead.  Nevertheless, I miss them.  The producers really ought to bring the trio back for at least one show in each season.

Regarding post-Christie sensibilities on sexual matters, heaven knows it's mild enough stuff in these productions, but why do they bother?  The stories are set in 1937, not 2007 or even 1977.  Whatever people were doing then, they certainly were not talking about it freely, as here.  (And yes, I am aware of such people as Sackville-West and Trefusis, but that was a juicy scandal, not a casual aside, as in ""The Hollow"" in the companion series.)

Finally, there are the production values.  Some reviewers are impressed.  I am not.  Whatever the current producers are paying, they are not getting their money's worth.  The old series was a well-designed gem.  Remember those opening graphics?  And that annoying but unforgettable theme music?  The old series showcased Art Deco artifacts and architecture.  The Deco movement peaked, then fell away in hardly more than a decade--two at most.  I am convinced the old series showcased every good example of Art Deco architecture to be found in all of Britain.  By contrast, the new series is flat, uninteresting.  Instead of bright, clean-lined Art Deco, we see nothing but the same-old-same-old Masterpiece Theater/A&E Presents visuals blahs that turn up a dozen times a week on PBS.  Even worse is the rhythm of the new series.  With the regularity--not to mention the soul of a stopwatch, everything periodically comes to a lurching halt.  (Why they do not display a black card saying ""Insert Commercial Here"" I cannot imagine.)  And the music!  That old tune is still there, but almost inaudible in the background.  What a waste!  Let's not even talk about the opening credits.

In summary, these are acceptable productions of (sometimes VERY) loose adaptations of Christie's mid-career novels.  They're good enough, but not the visual treats they used to be.  On the other hand, even mediocre Poirot is better than no Poirot at all.

2471338,4,B000CRR3EC,"Agatha Christie repeatedly returned to a restricted set of formulae.  At her prime it was perhaps difficult to find a wide array of glamourous prototypes for female characters, hence the number of kindly missionaries and actresses among the nobility and their dutiful woman employees.  And her overall canon of murder stories usually contains an algebraic logic: disguises, actresses' impersonations, corpses with bashed-in faces often crop up as indeterminate X factors with which to deceive or misdirect.  In this set of DVDs, Christie sometimes indulges the cliches and sometimes leads on her longtime fans by seeming to indulge them.  Good fun.

It is interesting that this DVD collection reshuffles these elements in half of its offerings, and visits even more Christie formulae in all four.  They are least successfully applied in AFTER THE FUNERAL, where the killer is obvious to Christie devotees very early on and one waits to see how the clues will arrange themselves to fit the ""Christie-an cliches.""  That said, the same components are used with refreshing variety in TAKEN AT THE FLOOD.  As with Lumet's ORIENT EXPRESS, I kept waiting for the story to proceed past the preliminary interviews and suddenly found the next item of business was the explanation of the crime.  Ingenious imbedding clues and nice ensemble company plot twists are worthy of Christie's other mainstay, the Marplean ""enclosed village.""

THE MYSTERY OF THE BLUE TRAIN is resolved with unusually delightful herrings and improbabilities.  But CARDS AT THE TABLE is of particular interest.  The adaptor has simplified some plot elements, embellished others with a ""modern"" sensibility Christie would not have indulged in her day, and eliminated altogether a farfetched piece of melodrama involving a window washer that arbitrarily climaxes the novel on which this teleplay is based.  In this instance, the changes are an improvement.",1158364800,8,1916,5.346666666666667
2471339,3,B000CRR3EC,"David Suchet does a great job, as always. But without his support actors, and the faulty way that A&E handles the recordings; it is time to say ""Good-Bye Poirot.""",1158105600,7,162,4.620689655172414
2471340,5,B000CRR3EC,"While checking out what's new in mystery, I was thrilled to happen upon a new series of David Souchet's Poirot!  I personally think he IS Agatha Chrisities little grey celled, precice detective come to life!  The four newly released crimes are excellently produced.  The productions are lavishly beautiful and seem to be even more brilliant in DVD format.  If you like to curl up with a good DVD mystery,especially when it seems all of the cable stations are playing nothing you want to watch, this set should be in your collection.  ""The Mystery of the Blue Train""; ""Taken at the Flood"";  ""After the Funeral""; and ""Cards on the Table"" will keep you enthralled.  If you have read the stories you will be pleased with the DVD adaptation! The films are true to the books, which is important to me. I think Dame Agatha would smile and add these to her own collection!  Now, we who are David Souchet/Poirot fans must press A&E to produce ""Murder on the Orient Express""!  Wouldn't you love to see Souchet on that train?",1154995200,13,1014,4.651685393258427
2471341,3,B000CRR3EC,"I am completely dumbfounded by the way these movies are edited. I actually was quite sure I was watching ""abridged"" editions of much longer and probably more satisfying movies. But from what I have read here these are the complete product. I think the editing is very poor, jumping from scene to scene and often back to the same actors in a completely different setting so you are left to wonder - same day? However, they are beautifully filmed. The atmosphere is wonderful, the tone and feeling, sets etc are as always very well done. I do miss Poirot's cohorts. I loved the actors and their on screen personalities.",1154736000,11,617,4.669724770642202
