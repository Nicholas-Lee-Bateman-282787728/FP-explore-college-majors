8659992,5,B00KMD36QA,"The Lone Ranger is a Disney 2013 action/adventure/comedy feature film based on both the 1930's radio dramas and the popular 1950's TV series and stars Johnny Depp(Black Mass), Armie Hammer(The Man From UNCLE), and Helena Bonham Carter(Sweeney Todd). Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film centers around John Reid(Hammer), a lawyer who travels to Texas to meet up with brother and the rest of the Texas rangers, when they are ambushed by a ruthless outlaw. Near death, John is nursed back to health by Tonto(Depp), a mentally-ill Native American warrior who helps John fight for justice but only with a mask and a new identity, the Lone Ranger. The only special feature in this DVD are the hilariously gross blooper reel and trailers for other Disney family favourites, Saving Mr. Banks and Muppets Most Wanted. The Lone Ranger is the best Disney action film to date and Depp's portrayal of Tonto is just as super-cool as Jack Sparrow!",1448150400,,933,4.949044585987261

I assume that these reviews have been submitted by literalists who have NO sense of humor and even less imagination.  For instance since the ""Lone Ranger"" character is a newly-minted, idealistic LAWYER, most lawyers will find his IDEALISM to be ""obnoxiously"" naive.  BUT since regular people, who AREN'T lawyers, find the literal nit-picking of most lawyers to be ""obnoxiously"" stupid, their literalistic panning of THE LONE RANGER is the BEST RECOMMENDATION of all!!!!
  The BOTTOM LINE is that if you liked Jimmy Stewart's ""pooka"" RABBIT in the black & white movie HARVEY, then you'll be amazed by the ""pooka"" CROW and the ""pooka"" HORSE in THE LONE RANGER.  If you liked Johnny Depp in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, then you'll love him in THE LONE RANGER--there's even a ""reprise"" of Captain Sparrow's first scene in the original PIRATES movie included in THE LONE RANGER!",1402099200,,962,4.944099378881988
