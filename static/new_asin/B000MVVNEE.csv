8173107,5,B000MVVNEE,I couldn't be happier with the condition this arrived in. The individual tapes and the set box were in excellent sealed condition; the video quality was good. The painted box art looks great with the rest of my collection.,1393113600,,222,4.717948717948718
8173108,4,B000MVVNEE,"With Walter Cronkite as the host, the four tapes in the boxed set tell of the history of the findings and developement of the science of Paleontology. The first tape entitled ""The First Clue: Tale of a Tooth"" tells of the very first documented fossil and the man who studdied it. It goes on to tell of the methods of the early scientist to classify these bones that had no relation to any animal on God's earth. The second tape is titled ""The Fossil Rush: Tale of a Bone"" and tells of the discovery of fossil bones in the Frontier lands of early America and the rivalry between the leaders of this growing science, it also gets into the effects of dinosaurs on our culture. Tape three called ""Birth of a legend: Tale of an Egg"" takes us to France where a grade school class and their teacher dig fossil dinosaur eggs to put their town on the map. And back to the US to find more eggs and nesting sites. Tape four ""Giant Birds of the Air: Tale of a Feather"" Starts off in Germany where archaeopteryx is found in the limestone quarry to wher the dinosaurs have gone and why they disapeared. and the end I will not give away!! Haha!! The interviews with the scientists are very informitive, the onsite footage is not too bad, the amimation of the dinosaurs is not on par with J-Park! and The background music is kinda sad. An entertaining documentary on the history of how we know what we know about Dinosaurs.",970963200,2,1407,4.394636015325671
