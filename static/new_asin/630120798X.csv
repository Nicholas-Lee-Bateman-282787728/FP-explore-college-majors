Susan Sarandon's character -- Annie Savoy -- is iconic. Sarandon was 41 when this movie was filmed. She's such a role model to me for how to be sexy as you age. I love her.,1510531200,,333,4.21875

314955,5,630120798X,"Review of Bull Durham
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

This ones a total cutie. Americas two favorite pastimes, baseball and sex, combine in Bull Durham, a delightful romantic comedy with a real-life happy ending.

Susan Sarandon, in her totally adorable heyday, plays a baseball groupie with a tradition of having an affair with a different player of the Durham Bulls each season. This season, the lucky man has been chosen, but what happens when a new, handsome, charming, sexy coach shows up and throws a wrench in her plans?

What a love triangle! Susan Sarandon torn between Tim Robbins and Kevin Costnerget ready for some steamy scenes! And how darling is this: Susan and Tim became real-life sweetie-pies during this movie and became one of the most famous acting couples in America.

Between Susans adorable North Carolina accent and a smart, sexy, and hilarious script, Bull Durham is a must-see. Just make sure to put the kiddies to bed first.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some pretty steamy sex scenes and language, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1497744000,,1111,4.888297872340425

315105,5,630120798X,"Wanna watch a movie about baseball?  Look elsewhere.  Wanna watch a movie that has baseball in it but is really about the people?  Here ya go.

I gotta love Bull Durham.  First and foremost, it was set in Durham, NC a quick drive from where I used to live.  For the most part, it has the feel of the area right.  Second, it does feature baseball.  People either love or could care less about baseball.  I happen to love it.  I was raised watching the San Diego Padres when they were in the Pacific Coast League.  I remember what it was like to be ""almost"" a star.  In that, this movie's got it right again.

Susan Sarandon usually leaves me nonplussed.  However, her character of Annie Savoy made me think twice about her.  Long involved with Tim Robbins who plays ""Nuke"" LaLooch, Annie not only becomes involved with ""Nuke"" but Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) an aging pitcher brought in to tame LaLooch's throwing.  This is a fun movie.  Most of the games were filmed in Durham, NC where the Durham Bulls actually play.  (The movie gave a much needed boost to the team and team's reputation.)",1470700800,,1090,4.474489795918367

Directed by Ron Shelton who knows sports movies (White men can't jump and Tin Cup) its an excellent comedy and baseball film. Kevin Costner gives one of his best performances as Crash Davis who is a wise, almost mystical loner/rebel ball player who loves the game and takes a young and equally great Tim Robbins under his wing. Susan Sarandon adds to the charm along with a great supporting cast. Its a very involving and hilarious comedy thats impossible not to love and is one of the best sports films ever made that doesn't get mentioned as often as some lesser ones for some reason.

315413,3,630120798X,"Garrison Keillor said of T.S. Eliot, How better to identify yourself as a serious poet than to be incomprehensible? I thought of that quote as I watched the much-lauded Bull Durham. Although it isn't in the same incomprehensibility league as The Waste Land, here is a sample of the films say what? pretentiousness:
Annie Savoy: These are the ground rules. I hook up with one guy a season. Usually takes me a couple weeks to pick the guy - kinda my own spring training. And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far, so I just thought we should kinda get to know each other.
Crash Davis: Time out. Why do you get to choose?
Annie Savoy: What?
Crash Davis: Why do you get to choose? I mean, why don't I get to choose, why doesn't he get to choose?
Annie Savoy: Well, actually, nobody on this planet ever really chooses each other.

Another way that the films pseudo-sophistication manifests itself is in its mocking posture toward Christianity. The film begins with Annie telling us that shes sampled all of the worlds faiths, but prefers the Church of Baseball. The only one of the other faiths that she singles out for criticism is Christianity. It seems that a very good way to win friends and influence movie critics is to pose as tolerant toward all faiths except Christianity. Later, we meet Jimmy. He is probably the most unsophisticated character in the film and, you guessed it, hes the devout Christian. It is possible that writer/director Ron Shelton has never met any Christian more sophisticated than Jimmy, but its more likely that this is an acceptable stereotype in the circles Shelton wants to impress. Although this posturing leaves a sour taste, the film does some things very well. It looks and sounds great, and the acting is superb. Although I think another Costner film, For Love of the Game has better-looking baseball, including its scene of a catcher catching a pop-up, Bull Durham is observant about many aspects of minor league life, both on and off the field. Its well-paced and sometimes witty. My favorite bit was the use of Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard. Bull Durham is rated R, partly for its many explicit discussions of sexuality, sex scenes with partial nudity and lots of profane and vulgar language.",1449187200,2,2270,4.746835443037975

315418,2,630120798X,"I was first chastised for having never seen this movie by other parents at my teenaged son's baseball game. Then I Googled the top 10 baseball movies, and Bull Durham was listed as number one. I checked Prime and Netflix assuming we could watch it for free since it's not a new movie. It was not available for free. Fine, I can afford $3.99 for HD. I played it for my son and me to watch on Friday night. I am not a prude, but this is not what I was expecting at all. This is not a baseball movie. It's a relationship movie, and yes, it's rated R, but I just figured there'd be swearing and some sexually themed scenes, with maybe some headshots during sex and references to sex. I didn't not expect it to be so graphic. My 15 year old finally got up and walked out of the room in disgust toward the end of the movie. We were both looking for a feel good baseball movie, like Field of Dreams, 42, or even Sandlot. This was really a disappointment. I think it is rated so highly because it's every man's wet dream to have a woman who knows as much about baseball as he does who takes a different man to bed each season. Plus, Susan Sarandon is a sexpot. Costner and Robbins were adorable too, but that's not the point.",1446336000,,1217,4.161016949152542

They have a torrid love affair (we can guess; we see nothing in fact) and that's about it.
The film has far too little content.

316047,5,630120798X,"Bull Durham is more than just a baseball movie. It's a mind set twist where ""Crash"" Davis (Kevin Costner) struggles on a minor league baseball team in a small town to hopefully one day make it big and join a major league team, while at the same time experiencing life on an emotional roller coaster with a sexy Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon).
With love on his mind, it is hard for ""Crash"" to stay focused on baseball. This brings out the reality of human nature in all of us. And along the way, ""Crash"" is deeply hurt when other rookies in the minors move on ahead of him into the big league and join other lucky professionals, while he, the veteran is left behind.
Bull Durham is mixed with comedy, drama, and romance. The veteran baseball player teaching the rookies how to play ball and make it into the big league, along with a love triangle, will keep viewers spellbound for hours up to the very end. Marvin P.

And since I've been to a few minor league games since I saw this movie, I can attest that what they showed in this movie about the minor leagues is what goes on at those games.",1367712000,,442,4.226190476190476
316388,5,630120798X,"I once heard a baseball aficionado claim that from a spectator's point of view, the less the status of the league, the better it was for the spectator. That is, the minor leagues were much better than the majors and the lower the level there, the more fun it was to watch. Well, I haven't seen enough baseball to comment, but when I watched the ""Bull Durham"" DVD last night I wondered if this might also apply to baseball movies. ""Bull Durham"" starring Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon was a fun movie to watch, one of the best I've seen in several years. I discovered it in the five dollar bin at a near-by Wal-Mart. The movie involved a very minor-league Durham Bulls baseball team where Kostner was an aging catcher and Sarandon was an aging groupie. Kostner was, more or less, in charge of Tim Robbins, a fresh young pitcher with a million-dollar arm and a five-dollar head.

This is just one of those movies that was lots of fun to watch. Everything about it bordered on the absurd, but it still all seemed believable and provided loads of laughter. The acting was quite good, but it all seemed tongue in cheek and that was the tone throughout the entire cast. Nobody ever seemed to be trying for a laugh, but just try to watch this film without having a smile on your face. The movie had a nice pace with no lags. It just flowed along from one absurd situation to  another in a relaxed, low-key fashion and nothing ever seemed very serious. The filming, sound and story were all very well done. The language is a bit abusive, but it fits the story and the assembled characters. If you're a baseball fan, you'll love it. If you're not a fan, you'll love it just as much. Wonderful movie!

The gypsy lifestyle of professional baseball is well displayed in this film with certainty only guaranteed with incredible talent.

It is a promiscuous female expert fan (Annie Savoy) and a veteran hard hitting catcher (Crash Davis) who jointly refines a raw talented pitcher (Nuke Laloosh) on and off the field.

Ultimately the trio all find their right places in life and baseball is their vehicle to these destinations, which provides them all with some long deserved contentment.

316644,3,630120798X,"'Bull Durham' was praised by Sports Illustrated as a great baseball movie, one of the best baseball films in the history of sports films. I'll have to respectfully disagree with that assessment, but the film does have its warmth and charm -- once you get over the F-bombs and gratuitous sex!

We have a woman nearing middle age who worships the religion of baseball -- and she takes to bed a specific player every season start. 'What a slut!' says I. At least until the film continues and shows a woman who is really quite shallow, lonely and at times does not know what the heck she really wants.

It's a hard film to pin down. Baseball is the back-drop, but the center of attention is on this romantic triangle of sorts: 'Crash', played by Kevin Costner (who has done better in Field of Dreams).

'Crash' is really a loser -- he played in the big leagues (""made the show"") for a short time but ended up playing most of his life in the minors. He's been called down as catcher for the Durham team to train and handle 'Nuke' LaLoosh (Tim Robbins). Nuke is a real jerk, who can't throw a fast ball straight to save his life.

The rest of the team is made of cardboard characters that are not well developed in the film. Except for a few quirks (voodoo on the baseball bat; Mayan wisdom, et al) there's not a lot to be said. Ho hum.

Our girl Annie is quoting Walt Whitman and screwing boys, not really getting what she really wants from life, at least until the end.

And Costner's character is an anti hero of sorts himself -- when his protg has finally made it to the majors, Costner's character acts jealous and is very hurtful -- hard to sympathize with this character.

And sex -- if you like your porn soft, this film could certainly serve.

Baseball? Yeah, there were a few homers and a couple runs batted in. Not up to the standard of ""A League of Their Own"" or ""Field of Dreams"" by any means. Even Redford's ""The Natural"" strikes ""Durham"" out!!

""I see great things in baseball. It's our game - the American game. It will take our people out-of-doors, fill them with oxygen, give them a larger physical stoicism. Tend to relieve us from being a nervous, dyspeptic set. Repair these losses, and be a blessing to us."" ~Walt Whitman

316647,5,630120798X,"Three terrific actors make a good script into a hit film.  I'm not a baseball fan and probably that's what kept me from seeing this twenty years ago.  My mistake!  Because I think I would have enjoyed it even more back then.  My only criticism is that it is a bit dated; things that were fresh and quirky then have been copied over and over and so seem old now.  This is probably most evident in the Sarandon character.  A little of that sexy/cosmic/ flakiness  goes a long way in my book.  But she's very good at it.

I never saw Tim  Robbins in a film until Mystic River, where he gave a stunning performance.  Since then I've seen him in several roles and he is almost always outstanding.  I was surprised, when I saw him here, so young and lean and actually cute. ( I used to wonder what Sarandon saw in him; now I can tell.)  He was tremendously funny in this role; just seeing him pitch a ball with his outrageous floppy style is worth the price of admission.

Some people love Kevin Costner and some don't.  I'm one of his fans and find him tremendously appealing.  He's also really lean here... defintely leading man material.

There are some nice touches.  I loved Sarandon's house with the huge flowered wallpaper! The record of Edith Piaf singing ""Je Ne Regrette Rien.""

Granted, the antiquated MPEG-2 codec used for the disc, combined with 1080p resolution from a HD transfer, gives it that ""best DVD you have ever seen"" quality that makes it look slightly anemic compared to more up to date transfers using AVC and so forth.

But all you have to do is put the included DVD in and A/B the two discs and the differences stand right out. The BD is the clear winner. The special features and commentary, what that there is, is included on the DVD version of the film. As to why we are getting several of these BD/DVD combos with the special features on the DVD instead of the BD, I would assume that it is either a rights situation, or the studio doesn't want to do anything other than take the masters they have on the shelf off the shelf and do no more.

316730,3,630120798X,"I must be missing something here, but I just don't find this film as universally brilliant as so many make it out to be.  Maybe it's that I am not a sports fan, especially not baseball (honestly, when Susan Sarandon mentions in her opening monologue that baseball is never boring I actually laughed out loud because I thought it was the films first joke), but I was actually really looking forward to this movie and it failed me on many levels.  I should have known that Costner was going to ruin a few things (why is it that his only great performance came so late in his career; `The Upside of Anger'?) because he is such a dreadfully boring actor, but I have been known to like his movies despite his performances (`JFK', `Dances with Wolves') so I didn't really think he would totally destroy my hopes of enjoying this film.  I mean, I adore Susan Sarandon and find Tim Robbins engaging and even fascinating at times, so I was really looking forward to this.

Sarandon and Robbins are Oscar worthy; the film as a whole is not.

Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a baseball enthusiast who picks one player per year to invest herself into, forming a relationship that will hopefully give them a strong year.  She loves baseball and she loves me, and so she has found a way to infuse both of them.  Ebby Calvin LaLoosh is the newest and freshest thing on the field, a wild pitcher who has an arm touched by god but lacks control.  Crash Davis, a legend in his town, is brought in to help reign in that arm.  Savoy also decides to make LaLoosh her personal project, forming a strangely intriguing triangle.

The script is funny and witting in scenes, but tends to lose me in others.  It just seems very all over the place.  It calls to mind one of the wittier lines in the movie, where Millie tells Annie that LaLoosh ""`blanks' like he pitches, all over the place"".  The script is like that too.

The acting is also like that...in fact the entire movie is really all over the place.

Susan Sarandon is delightfully charming as Annie.  She delivers a solid comedic performance that is rich with sentiment and believability (we actually believe that she thinks she is making a difference).  Tim Robbins is hysterical as LaLoosh, delivering a very strong performance in his portrayal of an overly confident youngster trapped in an adult's game.  Kevin Costner is boring as all get out.  I just don't see the charm here, at all.  He delivers every line in this monotone and stagnant manner, but I know many people would disagree so whatever.

In fact a lot of people will disagree with this review.

Whatever.

I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, and at times I really enjoyed it, but it's just a little all over the place.  It works one minute, doesn't the next; it's brisk one minute, drags the next; it's witty one minute and convoluted the next.

If you are a fan of baseball or sports movies in general then you will probably like this.  A lot of devoted baseball fans claim this to be the definitive baseball movie.  I have honestly seen better, but that's just me.  It's decent and I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it; and Robbins and Sarandon are just wonderful, but as a whole I just was not as impressed as so many others were.

316789,5,630120798X,"If you've never seen ""Bull Durham"" before, and are tempted to write it off as another sports flick, I beg you to rethink your position.  Let me tell you my all-time favorite sports movie: ""Hoop Dreams"".  What about it resonates with me so strongly?  It's not a basketball movie --- instead, it is a character drama that just happens to exist within a basketball court.  In other words, where the story takes place is irrelevant; what dominates the picture is how the story (or real-life events) affects the characters (documentary subjects).

""Bull Durham"" might not belong in the realm of that classic, but skeptics shouldn't dismiss it simply because it involves baseball.  Overlookers won't realize that it's a funny exploration of how people discover their own ambition; the dirt diamond & ball are circumstantial.

The story begins when a minor league team is joined by veteran catcher Crash Davis (Kevin Costner).  Crash has been given the unenviable task of mentoring an immature pitcher whose deadly fastball ""couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat"".  Tim Robbins plays the pitcher, Eddie Laloosh.  Eddie soon takes the nickname ""Nuke""; Crash decides ""Meat"" is a better way to condescend the undisciplined rookie.

Let me pause there, because this sound like we're going to get a fairy tale of how a cynical teacher and hotshot student will become better humans by the end of their journey.  Thankfully, writer-director Ron Shelton was much smarter than this, and doesn't treat his story like a whimsical children's book.  Crash and Nuke engage in some of the harshest (and funniest) banter in the history of comedies; the only times either learns anything from each other is because one just can't deal with the tension and submits.  I won't give anything away, but if you've never seen this movie before, you'll thank me later when Nuke shakes off Crash's pitching calls --- twice!  If for whatever reason you don't like Costner or Robbins, their perfect chemistry will change your mind.  It's been 20 years since ""Bull Durham"", and both actors have rarely been better.

When this unbearable pairing of Crash & Nuke begins, they soon meet Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon).  Annie is a strange blend of sexual creature and muse.  She takes one player per season, and selects that player as her mate and student.  In the hands of another actress or director, this would come off as sleazy & trashy.  But once Annie begins to make her new choice stimulate his mind with poetry BEFORE satisfying his primal urges, it becomes clear that eroticism is not even a factor.  You know, when I think of Sarandon, ""sexy"" is not the first word to come to my mind.  But ""Bull Durham"" convinced me otherwise.  Just look at the boxart!  But then wait until you watch the performance: it's a treasure from her opening monologue to the emotional finale!

What results from the Crash/Nuke bickering, Annie's sensual tutoring, their bizarre triangle, and the adventurous Durham Bulls season is a movie that is achingly funny...but then Shelton gently pulls the curtain back to reveal some more layers.

I forgot the mention the Durham Bulls team name earlier because they're not the primary focus.  I haven't revealed many plot points because the plot's mostly in the background.  I can't recall any 'BIG GAMES' or 'TWISTS'.  Hell, there's hardly any baseball for the last 30 minutes of the picture!  What ""Bull Durham"" leaves with viewers are the characters & the little details.  We don't care which games the Bulls won, but we remember the teammates' weird superstitions & conversations.  Annie's teachings are incredibly silly, but she eventually acknowledges how ridiculous some of her behavior is.  The three principals do discover their dreams, but in a most unlikely way.  The romance is sweet, patient, and believable offbeat.  Best of all, ""Bull Durham"" works on all paces --- it speeds up to make us laugh, and still keeps our attention when it slows down for reflection.

""Bull Durham"" is a hard movie to describe because there's really nothing else like it.  Ron Shelton has created a small-town comedy that resembles something from Frank Capra's mind.  It's as much a celebration of life as it is a parody of it.  There are no grossout gags; just strong acting and intelligent writing.  The game of baseball is merely a catalyst of more meaningful ideas.  But have no fear: there's plenty of baseball comedy for sports buffs.

""Bull Durham"" includes the good times of a ""movie"", but earns its place as a ""film"" --- the perfect balance of entertainment and genius!

The development of the love triangle between Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner gives the movie a nice story line.  There is also a good bit of humor thrown into the mix.

316791,5,630120798X,"I was a huge baseball fan when I worked in radio in the Kansas City area during the 70s and 80s when the Royals were a great team to watch.  Part of the joy of watching them play was team leaders like George Brett and Frank White who were so passionate and honest about their love for the game, you couldn't help but enjoy watching them play.  What does this have to do with a romantic comedy about minor leaguers and the absurdities of their team's misadventures in the Carolina league?  Because ultimately, that's what Bull Durham is about - pure passion for baseball.  You see it when Skip and Larry watch Crash Davis rant about being demoted to Class A and threaten to quit, only to turn and ask when batting practice starts.  They're all hooked and no amount of misfortune or indignity will ever separate them from this game and they all know it.  You see it in Annie Savoy whose passion for men and spirituality, as great as they are, are clearly second to her passion for baseball.  You see it in Max Patkin, the 'Clown Prince' who joyously proclaims, ""I love this game"" when talking about his work in a bar.  And you see them all trying to teach it to bonus baby, Nuke LaLoosh.  Yes, the movie has foul language, sex, absurd pranks, and lots of other non-baseball stuff throughout.  But what the movie is actually ABOUT is a pure passion for the game of baseball.  And therein lies its charm.  Bull Durham's essential message is this: whether you're in the bigs or in pee-wee ball, whether you get laid or not, whether you succeed or not, whether you have a crowd watching or not, the game is always there for you.

Twice if it's a Sunday double-header.",1179187200,4,1661,4.442244224422442
316822,4,630120798X,"""Bull Durham"" was released in 1988.  It was written and directed by Ron Shelton, who knew his way around a baseball field, and runs the bases in a swift,witty 108 minutes.  It stars Kevin Costner, in what may be the first of his successful sports-themed movies, Susan Sarondon, and a young Tim Robbins, at the outset of his career.  It happily combines romantic comedy and baseball: many people still consider this the best movie about the boys of summer.

It's set in Durham, North Carolina, then, as now, a minor league southern town, with advertisements for the simpler regional remedies of the time on the stadium's walls, many reminders of its tobacco-dependent local agricultural economy, and the plentifully blooming oleander, one of the glories of the south, all around the town.  (But, you will recall, the decidedly major league Duke University is also in town.)

At any rate, as it opens, young ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Robbins), a cocky, extravagantly talented but wild pitcher, has just reported for duty.  He's shortly followed by Crash Davis (Costner), a seasoned catcher, the player to be named of the contract,sent to help tame LaLoosh.  They form two sides of a romantic triangle with Annie Savoy (Sarandon), a part-time teacher of English at the local community college, and, more importantly, the team's unofficial trainer-handler.  Every season she takes one player as her lover; he leaves her bed a better man, and a better player.  Who's it to be?

Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl turn in winning performances as the team management.  The film's three stars also turn in disciplined, light on their feet performances.  The film apparently catches them before their powerful primes.  Sarandon and Robbins, who real-life hooked up pretty darn permanently on this set, later became more interested in arguing politics.  Costner, who became a very big star indeed, later began delivering home-made chaotic behemoths to the multiplex.  Here, all three deliver their lines with gusto.

Be warned, if you're looking for family viewing, the film's got some pretty salty, appropriate-to-ball players language.  The film's also got an entertaining score, including several sly blues, and a vinyl Edith Piaf ""No, Je Regrette Rien"" on Savoy's old record player.  Add flavorful interior decoration -- Savoy's house is a marvel of funky eclecticism.  Also some pretty hot, sexy scenes; some witty, resonant dialogue that's passed into the national consciousness: ""I believe in the church of baseball,"" Annie says. (It can't be coincidence that baseball players call their groupies ""Annies."")  And ""Bull Durham"" actually quotes famed American poet Walt Whitman's ""I Sing the Body Electric;"" it goes on to quote him further: ""I see great things in baseball.""

But I do take offense at the idea that a baseball player can have a good season because he slept with someone.  That's superstition.  There are two ways to have a good season--skill and practice.  A little prayer now and then may help too, but mostly its skill and practice.  That's how it is with everything in life.  If you wanna be good, it takes skill and practice.  That's especially true in baseball.
Now, maybe sleeping with Susan Sarandon could give a man more confidence in his skill and make him want to practice more, but he still owes his success to skill and practice.
Do you get what I'm saying?
If you wanna be good at baseball, sharpen your SKILL with PRACTICE.

316830,4,630120798X,"From the vintage images during the opening credits, I found myself feeling nostalgic, which is odd because I'm a relatively new baseball fan and I had no idea who most of these important players in baseball history were. (Admittedly, I was given a brief education beforehand by a fan of the movie who recommended I watch it.)

Why the nostalgia?

Perhaps because of the Americana that baseball represents.

The movie had a distinctive 80's feel, in terms of plot, character, and direction. They just don't make movies like they did in the 80's. I think it's something to do with that old Cold War feeling of good versus evil and belief in America and Americans. It translated effortlessly in film and maybe that's why most of my favorite movies of all time were made in that era. Sure, they're formulaic, but I like the formula. The characters were better, the conflict was better, and yes, the baseball was better.

Maybe the nostalgia I feel is because of the romance: there's a love triangle, and more importantly, there's the romance of the baseball diamond.

Kevin Costner as Crash Davis is the everyman character, the player with the brains but not the talent. He's so believable and confident that I find it easier to forgive him for some of his wooden performances I've seen since.

Tim Robbins played the over-the-top Nuke LaLoosh and he was so accurately naive and smarmy in his role that sometimes I felt embarrassed for him. And I've never noticed how tall he was until he stood next to Costner, dwarfing him.

Susan Sarandon (Annie Savoy) is smoldering and smart. I often wonder why we think she is sexy and it's easy to see from this film that it's her attitude more than her unusual looks. And it was more acceptable to go around without a bra back then, too.

Her house with the wrap-around porch and the swing and the clawfoot tub and femininity everywhere made me want to move back east, into a small town in the south and buy a grand old fixer-upper under a mossy live oak. Summer nights would be spent at the ballfield, watching the local Triple A team play. Ain't that America?

I can't believe it took me almost twenty years to watch this film. I'm glad I waited. I wouldn't have appreciated it any sooner.

Crash Davis said, ""Play the game with fear and arrogance.""

Oh, and if you're lucky, you'll find the person you were meant to be with sitting on your porch swing when you come home after a game's been rained out.",1145664000,7,2442,4.590804597701149
316831,5,630120798X,"I've probably watched Bull Durham a dozen times, but it was only during my latest viewing that I saw this 1988 masterpiece as a kind of de facto period piece, a story stuck in time. Think Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) in his baggy pants and nylon bomber jacket, and ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) and his Miami Vice-style white cotton blazer and pilot-style Ran Ban shades.

That's not a bad thing. Some other films anchored in their era -- Casablanca, Sunset Strip, and The Graduate are the first three that come to mind -- are among the best films ever made. And I think that with time, this wonderful effort from one-time minor league prospect Ron Shelton may take its place among that rarified company.

Ostensibly, it's a story about baseball -- and without a doubt, some understanding of the most poetic of sports is an essential element to enjoying the film. But there's more to it than the action: it's first and foremost a terrific coming of age story about Mr. Robbin's LaLoosh, helped along by his two ""professors"" -- Mr. Costner's Crash Davis and Annie Savoy, played by Mr. Robbins' then-future wife, the impeccable Susan Sarandon. Crash and Annie are drawn to each other even as they argue over their respective influences on LaLoosh, and by the end we find they've both done their share of growing up themselves.

I won't go into the compelling plot here, since that's adequately summed up by other reviewers.

The settings are charming -- whether it's the small-town south, a minor league ballpark, or Annie's house with its antique furnishings, it's alter to baseball, and Edith Piaf serenading the screen. The baseball scenes are unusually well acted, the dialogue is sharp and witty, and the humor is dry and satisfying.

It's also the film that put the talented Mr. Robbins on the map as an actor, and it may have represented the high-water mark for Mr. Costner's hot-and-cold career.  But most importantly, I think it's already starting to take on the feel of a classic for a certain generation of moviegoers that includes yours truly.",1145491200,2,2051,4.8125

316863,1,630120798X,"After sitting through 20 minutes, I thought things were going to pick up, but 40 minutes later, the plot was getting more dull and boring! A veteran catcher is assign to help a novice pitcher, both are too arrogant, and at each other's throat. One has the natural talent of throwing fast and nothing more. The other had to work for everything. As a result, jealously and aggression come into play between the two idiots. Plus, some horny, religious, psychotic, baseball woman is sexually after both of them. GIVE ME A BRAKE! Comedy and sport don't mix, throw in sex, and it becomes a disaster. Why is it even considered a comedy? Maybe you'll be laughing when you realize you just slept through the entire movie. Anyways, the comedy is dry and grossly corny! Drama? Yes, if you consider some woman being too obsess with sex, and performs in bed by reading poems. I don't know how she got into the position of ""helping"" young rookies, but her character is too illogical. There is some drama between the catcher and pitcher, but nothing too thrilling to care about. I may not be a baseball fan or even a sport fan, but I've watched enough movies to tell that this one is completely unrealistic. Don't waste your time on this one.  ....only thing good here is that I can't give it a 0/5 star.",1138147200,8,1289,4.532188841201717

This is one of the best written films I have ever seen and the fact that it concerns baseball is almost  incidental.  In the audio commentary, the writer and director, Ron Shelton, admits to being a fan of baseball.  However, there are much deeper issues involed,incuding what the media does to star players and how easy it is to corrupt them.  My favorite scene is the lecture that old pro, Kevin Costner, gives to the somewhat dim,  Tim Robbins, as they are riding on the team bus.  The magnificent Susan Sarandon does a voiceover and has some of the best lines in the film.  Her performance alone is worth the price of the DVD.",1137283200,,712,4.3816793893129775

This is a quirky and entertaining story about minor leaguers, old and young, dreaming of making it to ""the show.""  I love the fun they have with player's superstitions, from blessing their bats, to wearing women's underwear, to abstinence.  Overall I consider this to be a worthwhile feel-good movie, with a lot of quirky humor and interesting characters.  Maybe not appropriate for young kids due to language and adult situations, but all in all I'd say it is pretty mild.  For me anyway, this is a movie that I can watch again and again without getting sick of it.  Well worth buying in my opinion.",1132790400,,723,4.698412698412699
316866,5,630120798X,"Hollywood and baseball don't seem very compatable; whatever it is that makes baseball so wonderful and enjoyable has never been fully captured on the screen. Until this movie came out, that is; it comes the closest so far. Kevin Costner plays a veteran minor league catcher (Crash Davis) sent to Durham, NC, by ""the organization"" to ""mature"" a pitcher with ""a million dollar arm and a 5-cent head."" There he meets baseball groupie Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) who is in the habit of taking up with one of the players for the season; she chooses the same kid prospect that Crash has been ordered to help, Nuke LaRoosh (Tim Robbins). Both she and Crash work on the kid to turn him into a big-leaguer - in their own way.

For once the baseball on the field (and in the buses and locker rooms) looks good; the feeling for the game, especially from the minor league perspective, has been captured well. Costner is given some great lines that any baseball enthusiast would enjoy. The love story that evolves between him and Sarandon is about what you'd expect. But for once we look forward to getting away from the love interest and back to the game.",1126915200,4,1144,4.607843137254902

Kevin Costner should be required to make at least one sports movie per year.  He's made some great ones over the years and this is one of his best.  Tim Robbins is great as the bonus baby and Susan Sarandon is very funny as the baseball Annie.

316870,5,630120798X,"Ron Shelton spent some time in the minor leagues represented in his screenplay for Bull Durham, so he knows about the baseball things represented.  But he also clearly has a gifted ear for the tempo of real life, and he knows about hopes and desires and the things that make human beings tick.  The setting for this film with the minor league Durham Bulls works, and works perfectly, but the characters, especially among the central love triangle, could just as easily have been traveling salesmen or race drivers or con artists or gangsters.
Susan Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a slightly older woman who is a Durham Bulls groupie of sorts: once a season she picks out a promising young player and begins an affair with them.  During that season the promising young player has the year of his life and gets called up to the big leagues, leaving Annie to look for next year's promising young player.
The Bulls also have a million-dollar prospect of a pitcher with a right arm who the gods reached down and turned into a thunderbolt.  He also has less control than a seven year old with hyperactive attention deficit disorder without his Ritalin.  He's as likely to throw it over the backstop as throw a strike, although his ""stuff"" is like Nolan Ryan or Randy Johnson.  Tim Robbins brings ""Nuke"" LaLoosh to life in his best comic performance.
Kevin Costner, in the best of his many baseball-movie appearances, plays ""Crash"" Davis, a power-hitting catcher with enough talent to be a leader on minor league teams, but only 21 days in ""The Show"" in years of minor league work.  Crash is not only a competent minor league catcher though - he also knows the history of the game, and he knows how to get into the heads of players who have mental blocks preventing them from achieving all they can as baseball players.
Crash, meet Nuke.  Both of you - meet Annie.
The dialogue is so witty and sparkling that more than a decade after the film's release, it still shows up frequently in discussions about baseball movies and on ESPN.  Crash envies Nuke's god-given talent, and by degrees the clueless Nuke begins to appreciate Crash's baseball wisdom.  Annie has the hots for both of them, and they for her, and the way this triangle evolves and resolves makes for a very satisfying baseball movie watching experience.
The movie would be worth watching if only for the hilarious little scenes that happen out on the playing field between catcher Costner and pitcher Robbins.  Nuke has the million-dollar arm and the ten-cent head.  Crash knows his job (and everyone elses as well) like the back of his hand.  Whenever Nuke starts trying to think for himself, he quickly gets into trouble, frequently with active assistance from Crash.
Crash ""calls"" the game - signalling to the pitcher which pitches to throw.  When Nuke listens things go well.  When Nuke doesn't listen, Crash whispers to the hitter what pitch is coming so that the batter can tee off on the pitch.  Then as the batter circles the bases after his home run Crash goes out to the mound to remind Nuke not to try thinking for himself.  ""Boy, the last thing I saw fly out of here like that had a stewardess and passengers on it!""
Supporting parts are performed to hilarious perfection as well, with particular kudos to Trey Wilson as the manager and Robert Wuhl as a team coach.  They have many entertaining scenes, including the one following Nuke's minor-league debut - when he struck out 18..... but also walked 18 - both league records!  A must for grown-up baseball fans.",1089417600,22,3529,4.708943089430894

Every year she selects one member of the Durham Bulls to sleep with, and teach him about the finer things in life. This year gets interesting for Annie however, when she meets an up- and- coming pitcher named ""Nuke"" Laloosh ( Tim Robbins), and a veteran minor league catcher that is assigned to train Nuke named Crash Davis ( Kevin Costner). She informs the two, that they are this year's ""draft picks"". When Crash passes up the offer, Nuke eagerly awaits to start up with Annie. But Crash's jealousy soon takes over, and he convinces Nuke that sex with Annie will jinx the Bulls winning streak...
""Bull Durham"" has been a favorite of mine for a while now. The baseball action is realistic and fun to watch. The overall story of Nuke and Crash fighting over Annie is great. Not to mention the fact that Kevin Costner, Tim Robbins, and Susan Surandon are all outstanding. The best thing about the film perhaps is the relationship between Nuke and Crash. They are best friends one minute, and fighting each other the next. You gotta love Costner telling the hitters what's coming for Nuke shaking him off. Susan Surandon gives the best performance of her career with Annie Savoy. She is intelligent, extremely sexy, and hillarious. Watching her relate sex to baseball is outstanding. One of the funniest things you will ever see, is when she convinces Nuke to wear garders to enhance his sexual energy on the playing field. But the film has one MAJOR flaw, which is why I could not give it five stars. While I do enjoy the games played in the bedroom, I am a baseball fan first. ""Bull Durham"" is a love story with baseball thrown in. I would have liked it better if there was more focus on actual baseball.
Overall, ""Bull Durham"" is a great film. The baseball action is realistic, there is non stop laughs, and the acting is superb. If there could have been a little bit more baseball, it would have been as good as ""Major League"". The Special Edition DVD has some pretty good extras. The making of documentary was great, and I absolutely loved the commentary with Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins! Great stuff there.

316913,5,630120798X,"Ebby Calvin Laloosh (Tim Robbins) has a million dollar arm but no control over it.  The poor mascot gets hit about as often as it goes over the plate.  So the Durham Bulls brings in Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) to get him on track.  Crash has been a long time minor league player and even did a stint in the Show.  His career is ending and he is not thrilled to be called in to train the slow witted, strong armed Laloosh.  If anyone can get Nuke, whom Crash calls ""Meat"", to learn how to control his gift, it would be Crash... or maybe Annie.
It is not clear to me just what is the official capacity of Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) and Millie (Jenny Robertson).  Unofficially, though, they watch and critique the players on their games on the field and in the bedroom.  Annie hooks up with one ball player each season and, for that season, is committed to that one player's improvement in both arenas.  When she hooks up with Nuke, sparks fly between her and Crash as they both work on Nuke's performance on the field and it becomes indelibly tied to his performance in bed.
Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl make a hilarious team as the Manager and Assistant Manager of the Durham Bulls.  From Wilson's ""Lollygagger"" speech to Wuhl's pitcher's mound huddle over how to get a curse off of a player's glove and what to get another player as a wedding gift, these two alone are fun to watch.
This is a movie for adults - Kevin Costner has his great ""I Believe in"" speech in this movie and Susan Sarandon's relationships are highly sexual ... in a sensual sort of way.  It is definitely inappropriate for kids and you'll be blushing till the cows come home if you watch this with your teenagers.

You get a great look at off-field stories that go on in the ""bus leagues"" highlighted by Kevin Costner's character mentoring the character played by Tim Robbins.

316915,5,630120798X,"This is my favorite sports movie and, I think, Kevin Costner's best movie. (Well, he's also great in ""Tin Cup,"" an underrated masterpiece.)
""Bull Durham"" is vastly superior to the weepier ""Field of Dreams"" because it really is about baseball, not about some doofus who puts his family at risk in order to play catch with Daddy (I really hate that movie). Ron Shelton made ""Bull Durham"" for adults, not cringing inner children. It knows that sex and baseball make for a better mix than mysticism and baseball. That's why it is the better film.
What's not to love? Costner, loose and funny and supremely athletic, delivers his ""beliefs"" speech. Tim Robbins pitches wearing a garter belt. The ""Bermuda Triangle"" dialogue. The Walt Whitman seduction. The meeting on the mound. And Susan Sarandon. Yes, Susan Sarandon.
Great scenes: Crash Davis, introducing himself as the player to be named later. The coach, instructing his players on the basics of baseball. Crash telling the batter what pitch Nuke is going to throw. The two fight scenes. Crash's private note to Annie. And of course: the great ""Martian conversation with a Fungo"" scene.
What I'm saying is this: ""Bull Durham"" has great writing. Not just adequate writing that gets the plot from point A to point B, but beautiful, philosophical dialogue that establishes the personalities of the characters. You don't get that kind of writing today. It just rarely happens anymore.
""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Tin Cup"" come close in the sports movie realm, but ""Bull Durham"" established the tradition, and it is still the best.",1064707200,3,1569,4.99236641221374

316917,5,630120798X,"This film is the first in a long line of successful baseball films in which Kevin Costner plays the lead role.  In this film, Costner stars as Crash Davis, a career minor league catcher who is signed by the Durham Bulls to tutor their new star pitcher Nuke LaLoosh, played by Tim Robbins.  LaLoosh has a golden arm and a blazing fastball.  The problem is he has no control.  He ends up hitting the Bulls' mascot almost as many times as he manages to throw strikes.  To complicate Davis' and Laloosh's relationship even further is sexy Annie Savoy, played by Susan Sarandon.  She is a typical baseball groupie who latches on to one of the Bulls' players each season.  The problem is that both Crash and Nuke are vying for her affections.
Nuke ends up winning the affections of Annie and they start a torrid romance.  However, Annie still has feelings for Crash. Meanwhile, Crash has managed to help tame some of the wildness that Nuke was experiencing, and he has become a better pitcher.  The Bulls end up going on a long winning streak, and Nuke swears off sex during this time so as not to jinx the streak, thus leaving Annie very frustrated. As a result of his improved pitching, Nuke finally gets called up to the majors late in the season.
I thought this was a fine film.  Kevin Costner is the perfect baseball actor, as evidenced from some of his other baseball films such as ""Field of Dreams"" and ""For Love of the Game"".  His performance as Crash is first rate.  Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon are good as well.  The baseball scenes are well-done and the supporting actors do a good job.  This movie does a good job of portraying baseball life in the minor leagues.  There are no 50,000 seat stadiums or chartered airline flights for away games.  These players play in front of hundreds, not thousands of fans at a time and they travel to out of town games on a bus and carry their own bags.  Watch this excellent baseball film and discover the true magic that Kevin Costner possesses as a baseball actor.  I also highly recommend ""Field of Dreams"" and ""For Love of the Game"".  I think you'll enjoy all of them.",1042675200,2,2118,4.49738219895288
316918,5,630120798X,"There are some baseball movies not for kids, and this is one of them. The movie stars Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbings. Susan Sarandon makes her appearance right in the beginning, Tim Robbins makes his about 5 minutes later, and Kevin Costner makes his about 15 minutes into the movie. As the movie opens, Susan Sarandon is talking about baseball stuff, and how she feels the only church that really fells the soul, is the church of baseball. Which leads to Rock around the clock perfromed by Bill Haley and the Comets. Which Max Patkin appears as himself dancing to the music on the baseball field. It is Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" Laloosh's (Tim Robbins) debut. Which he makes wild throws, including hiting the mascot twice. While also walking and strking out 36 batters. Which is 18 for both walking and strking out batters. A minor league venteran catcher named Crush Davis (Kevin Costner) is called uip after the game. At first they fight. Which leads them to siting at a table at a bar together that catches baseball fan Annie Savoy's (Susan Sarandon) attention. She picks them as her two finalistest. Which one of them she will hook up with for the season. And even read books by authors to them if she and the player is alone. I also reccomented watching Field of Dreams along with this movie.
My thoughts on Bull Durham: First let me point out that this movie is rated R. And yes this is a very rare baseball movie that is rated R. The other one (at least that I know of) is Major League. Most baseball movies gets a PG rating. I think the movie would have better of, if the speech Annie Savoy gives in the opening of the movie could have been cut. Maybe you know leave out some of the stuff. And what about the opening song, I don't know the name of it, but it only has only two words. And they are yes and yeah. Plus I will also have to say that you can watch this movie in either widscreen or full screen. Which is great because one it doesn't say on the cover of the dvd what it shown in (if there are a full screen and a widescreen edition of the same movie). If you are confused by widescreen ans what does it mean, on dvd it means ""letterbox format"".",1035417600,,2172,4.352216748768473
316919,5,630120798X,"Back when Kevin Costner made good films, this terrific one about America's two favorite pastimes and the people who love them came out. With an onscreen heat you can practically feel, the film just screams sexy. The minute the opening monologue begins, it's a fascinating and funny insight into human emotion, sex and of course, baseball. Susan Sarandon proves the older woman is eternally sexy with her baseball groupie Annie Savoy. It's not that she's easy, she just picks one player a year to 'mature'. This year there are two promising candidates. One is a fiesty, talented but inexperienced pitcher who is not that bright; the other a seasoned catcher brought in to straighten the rookie out. Ultimately she chooses Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh (Tim Robbins, brilliant as an idiot), the dim but wild (hence 'Nuke') pitcher. The love triangle takes a backseat to baseball but always remains in the foreground. As the film progresses, a winning streak leaves Annie without a man and she soon begins to regret her decision. Finally a wildly sexy and romantic fling with Crash (a volcanic Kevin Costner), the rugged catcher, arrives. While it is the film during which Susan fell for Tim and she shares extraordinary chemistry with both men, the real attraction on-screen is the slow seduction between Annie and Crash. The film is so hot, it usually takes a nice shower afterwards to cool off. Good for those winter nights when baseball isn't in season.

316995,3,630120798X,"Bull Durham is a near-perfect baseball film. Although I feel it lacks some of the wonder of Costner's field of dreams, there are few films that can match Bull Durham's honest, sometimes gritty but always hilarious look into the carnival that surrounds the national pastime.
What particularly special about Bull Durham are the excellent performances given by the lead actors as well as the supporting cast.
Director Ron Shelton couldn't have asked for better performances from his three lead actors. This movie was made back when Costner could still carry a film. He is in the height of his ""everyman"" powers here. His portrayal of aging minor league slugger Crash Davis is one for the ages. Susan Sarandon smolders yet somehow manages to retain a certain kind of innocence as the groupie-slash-mentor Annie Savoy. Tim Robbins is outstanding as the hotheaded and somewhat mentally challenged rookie pitcher Nuke Laloosh.
The highlights of the supporting cast are Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl. They play the manager and pitching coach. Wilson is a pure scene stealer in this movie. He provides some of the movie's greatest lines and tenderest moments. Wuhl is the master of the obvious in his cool, almost straight-man delivery.
Bull Durham, like baseball, is about so much more than baseball. Along the way we are invited to think about both the inane and the deeper issues of life. Annie struggles for meaning, Nuke come of age and even Crash's cynical heart softens a bit.
All of the things listed above, as well as the fact that it is a darn good movie earn Bull Durham my hearty recommendation.",1025913600,12,1596,4.9148148148148145
316996,3,630120798X,"The catchline for Bull Durham talks about sex and baseball. Sounds great, right? Well, sort of. The movie has nowhere near enough baseball to make it a worthwhile sports movie-it actually borders on a chick flick. I forced myself to sit through two of Hollywood's most overrated actors (Costner, and the horribly cast Susan Sarandon), falling in love, leaving, doing it all over again, having sex, leaving again...you get the point. Actually, when he's playing baseball, Costner does a pretty good job as the aging Crash Davis. And where this movie really hits the mark is in baseball. So in a way, it's a half-great movie. The atmosphere of the minors is a joy to watch, with fans passing notes to the players, and the players being jerks to the batboys. Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl, who play the manager and assistant manager of the Durham Bulls, respectively, do a masterful job. Wuhl steals the show as the talkative Larry-the shower scene (not THAT kind of shower scene) may be the best moment in motion picture baseball (possibly finishing second to Who's on First)-and for that reason alone it's worth seeing the movie. Tim Robbins does a great job as Ebby Calvin, but isn't give much of a role to work with to make it really memorable. But by the end, I'm left with Sarandon and Costner, gazing into each others eyes...I wanted to puke. Really a letdown. As I said though, the baseball is right on, and for that reason you should see this if you haven't already, but after about the first half, you can go to sleep.",1024185600,2,1523,4.644444444444445
316997,5,630120798X,"You could say that Bull Durham breathed new life into baseball films.  This low budget movie with no stars made a great deal of money at the box office.  It also made other studios take the chance on baseball films.  Now of course, it wasn't just baseball that made Bull Durham so popular, though the baseball is quite good, it's the solid writing and sympathetic characters that make the film work.  The three no-stars are now all Hollywood Power players and the movie still hold up well.
The Special Edition of Bull Durham is the second DVD release of this film.  The first edition was good for an early release DVD.  It even had Ron Shelton's commentary.  The new DVD has that plus a commentary track by Costner and Robbins, and a new making-of documentary.
Ron Shelton's commentary focuses on his days as a minor league player and how tough it was to get this movie made.  He also talks a great deal about the production of the film and the actors.  Shelton makes a bold statement that only Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell are good enough athletes to look like baseball players on film.  Robbins' and Costner's commentary is more of a conversation about their experiences as actors on the piece.  They joke about making the film and even talk about some of the scenes that they shot that didn't make it into the film or the DVD for that matter.  The commentary was fun to listen to because the actors had a great time reliving the experience of making the film.  The making of featurette is like most DVD tag-ons, which is to say that it is mostly forgettable.  The other extras are decent diversions, but mostly just bulk.
As a baseball and movie fan the DVD is worthwhile just for the crisp film and commentary tracks.",1023580800,,1723,4.533980582524272
316998,5,630120798X,"I thought I read the book, or at least I dreamed it, but this is NOT adapted from something by Larry McMurtry, although it sure seems like it oughta be.  It is one hell of a funny, crafty, too real for life, kind of movie.  The brilliant script, full of clever one-liners, was written by Ron Shelton (White Men Can't Jump (1992)), who actually played minor league ball in the Orioles farm system.  Shelton also directed and did a bang-up job.  This is a funny movie that is really funny.
What I recalled (when I found out this wasn't from Larry McMurtry) was a baseball novel for juniors that I had read when I was a kid about a crafty, veteran minor league catcher who had once made it to the big leagues but got beaned and never got over it, always bailing out from an inside curve ball.  (This was in the days before batting helmets.)  He fell back to the minors and went from team to team and town to town, hitting a ton until somebody figured out that his knees would buckle if you brushed him back a bit, and then he'd have to move on.  Kevin Costner's part reminds me of that guy (without the beaning phobia).
Susan Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a baseball groupie in her sexual prime who likes to read poetry and give the players hitting advice.  She is just wonderful as she plays sexy mom to the boys, a new one every summer, just so she can avoid any kind of real relationship or commitment.  And so along comes Crash Davis (Kevin Costner, one of the more underrated and less flashy stars of our time), playing an itinerant catcher who has managed to hit nearly 300 minor league home runs.  He is tough and savvy and once made it to the Show for 21 days.  Tim Robbins plays Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" ""Meat"" LaLoosh, a not too bright, wild-armed phenom who needs more than a little guidance.  He gets a lot from both Crash and Annie, who are intent on schooling him in their differing expertise.  Nuke is just the hunk Annie needs to keep her from falling in love with Crash, but...well, this is a romantic comedy, so you can be sure that love will find a way.
The baseball shtick and the interior dialogues of Robbins and Costner during the games (""Why's he want the heat?  I wanna throw the deuce...""  And, ""Don't think, ...  Get that...woman out of your head--Time out!"") are really funny, and the bit where Robbins shakes him off and Costner, as an object lesson for his young pitcher, tells the batter what's coming next allowing the batter to hit it out of the park (or onto the Bull Durham sign to win a free steak dinner--is this genuine Americana or what?) are a crack up.  But also great are the scenes with Sarandon as she philosophizes (""I believe in the Church of Baseball"") and wise-cracks her way through the boys of summer, especially the scene where she ties Nuke up in bed and reads him some Walt Whitman.  Now THAT really tires the boy out!  Another great scene is on the bus when Crash lets the other players know that he once made it to the bigs where ""...you hit white balls for batting practice and the ballparks are like cathedrals.""  Beautiful.
Best dead-pan one-liner is when Crash catches Nuke in the locker room trying to adjust the panty hose girdle that Annie has talked him into wearing under his uniform: ""The rose goes in the front, big guy.""
By the way, the great rock and roll soundtrack includes the galvanizing baseball song, ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"" by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival fame.  (Or maybe the title's ""In Center Field"": ""Put me in coach. I'm ready to play, today, in center field."")
It's a shame that Shelton did not win the Oscar for this script, it's really that good.  (Ronald Bass won for Rain Man.)  The characters are just fascinating and full of life, and not just the three leads.  The bit players are funny too, including the hard-talking, middle-brained manager, the mindless pattering coaches, the sweet young groupie girl who makes it with all the players as fast as she can.  Even the team clown is good.
The irreverent characterizations, the sweet story, the realistic atmosphere of baseball in small town America (only slightly burlesqued), and some fine acting all rolled together make this one highly diverting little film, actually one of the best baseball films ever made.  See this with your best babe.  She'll like it as much as you.",1021766400,2,4320,4.526383526383526
316999,4,630120798X,"Sorry, people, but this is THE best film about baseball ever made.  To have a character like Annie Savoy (Saranden) liken this sport to a religion is priceless and probably true.  The meetings on the mound, especially the one about wedding gifts (""Candles sticks are good."") puts professional sports and those bohuncks who think they can be the next Ted Williams, Michael Jordon, Tiger Woods, or Emmit Smith, into a clear perspective.",1021507200,,434,5.013888888888889

Susan Sarandon is stunning and may have turned in the years best performance as a ""baseball Annie"" with both looks and a brain.

The Costner/Robbins commentary is great fun, in part because Costner isn't afraid to open up and criticize the pitfalls of the movie-making process. His descriptions of the deleted/alternate scenes leave us longing for a 20th anniversary edition (should there be one) that could include them. It also would have been great to hear Susan Sarandon's comments. The guys clearly hadn't seen the movie in a while and there's quite a bit of genuine laughter. Early in the commentary, Costner says something like, ""If weren't not careful, we're just going to sit here and watch this thing."" You get the impression that he's drawing Robbins out and helping him to become more comfortable -- remarkably like the Crash/Nuke relationship by the end of the film.
If the deleted/alternate scenes would have been included, I would have given this edition 5 stars. Regardless, it's worth owning.",1018656000,3,1154,5.111111111111111
317002,5,630120798X,"If you love baseball, then odds are you've seen & love Bull Durham, a sexy fun dramady starring Kevin Costner, Susan Surandon & Tim Robbins.  It's easily one of the best baseball movies ever made and the first of three in Mr. Costner's Baseball Trilogy (Field of Dreams & For Love of The Game would follow).
The extra features included in this Special Edition are pretty nice. Plus I also enjoyed the extra outer packaging sleeve that comes with the DVD case.  It's all white and looks like a big baseball.  The classic picture of Kevin standing next to a car with a beer in one hand and a bat in the other, with Susan perched beside him is still what's on the actual DVD case.  For the first time we actually get the trailers to Bull Durham and I really enjoyed watching the teaser & theatrical trailers.  But does anyone remember the original TV spots which always ended with the bathtub scene and seeing the candles getting put out with a splash of water?  The new making of documentary: Between the Lines, is a nice retrospective look back at the movie, with everyone involved, from Kevin, Susan & Tim, to director Ron Shelton himself, plus Robert Wuhl and others.  What also makes it fun is real Bull Durham baseball players also comment on the film and really give you the dirt on how it measured up to really being in the minors.  The other featurettes: Kevin Costner Profile & Sports Wrap are a little disappointing because they're very short (maybe 4 minutes each) and aren't new, just old featurettes made during the filming of the movie.  But they're still nice to have.  The Photo Gallery is nice too, but don't expect a lot of pics.  There's about maybe a hundred or so.  Now some of you will be surprised to learn that the Joe Cocker music video is not on the DVD.  I mean it might be a hidden easter egg but I doubt it.  More likely they were unable to get the rights to it and therefore not allowed to include it on the disc.  Which is sad because it's a great song.  I was lucky enough to get the soundtrack on CD which has been out of print for years.  They really should re-release it because the songs are just wonderful!
The audio commentaries included are both fun & insightful.  If you own the previous release of Bull Durham on DVD then you already have the Ron Shelton commentary which I enjoyed a lot.  He gives a lot of great stories and explanations about the film that really open your eyes a bit more.  But the real gem is the new commentary between Kevin Costner & Tim Robbins.  One thing you'll notice right away is all the scenes Kevin talks about that didn't make the final cut.  It's a real shame there's no deleted scenes section on this DVD so we could actually see them because they sound pretty good.  There's a couple of freindly jabs from Kevin on how Tim was lucky enough to end up with Susan Surandon and how he didn't even know they were dating during filming.  It does get a little intense when the love scene between she and Kevin comes up.  Tim says ""This is the part of the movie I don't like watching"".  But Kevin handles the tension nicely like a pro and talks about other things during the scene.  It's a lot of fun.  I wish these guys did another movie togeher!  The ironic thing I noticed is that Ron Shelton states that, regarding the famous speech given by Kevin at Susan's house, that he doesn't really like it and would not've written it the same way had he made the film today.  While Kevin, in his audio commentary says that it's a great speech but he didn't deliver it well enough and the strength of it lies with the words themsleves.  That's what made it powerful, not his acting.  Personally I think he's too hard on himself.  Plus I always smile during the part of the speech when he says ""I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone"", since Kevin starred in JFK.  It's a great speech and he does it perfectly.

For some reason MGM decided to give both a widescreen version and a standard pan & scan version for this DVD release, which means no cover art on the front of the disc.  I don't understand why they needed the standard version since the film only has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  But one reason you may want to consider keeping your old copy of Bull Durham on DVD is that the previous release was presented in THX for superior picture and sound quality.  The new special edition version is not.  And I think the THX version does look better too.  Guess MGM didn't feel like using it for their release.
You don't have to be a baseball fan to love this movie.  The acting is great, the characters are great, the music is timeless, & the romantic side is just as strong and touching as anything else. Pick up this special edition of Bull Durham.  While your at it, pick up the rest of Mr. Costner's baseball trilogy on DVD and then watch 'em all back to back. You'll be glad you did.

317003,5,630120798X,"Former minor league ballplayer, Ron Shelton crafted a funny, sentimental and romantic comedy based around a minor league baseball team, the Durham Bulls.  The film uses baseball as a backdrop for a love triangle between a local lady, a career minor league and a young phenom.  Kevin Costner stars as Crash Davis, a savvy veteran catcher who dispenses his wisdom on a young fireballer Nuke Lalush played by Tim Robbins.  Between the two of them is Annie played by Susan Sarandon.  Every season she picks a player who she dates for the season and dispenses her own brand of wisdom.  The film is full of rich and humorous dialogue and unlike most baseball films, offers a fairly realistic look at the game.  Mr. Costner has never been better than in this film, where his everyman persona is perfect.  He knows his career is winding down and he'll never fully realize his baseball dreams, but he can give back to the game he loves by helping the ignorant Nuke.  Mr. Robbins became a star with his hilarious turn as the goofball Nuke and Ms. Sarandon simmers in her lusty role.  Comedian Robert Wuhl garnered attention as a cliche spewing bench coach.

As such, the movie does NOT lead to an annoying, cheesy climax like most sports movies (i.e. the big game).  Instead, it starts about a dozen games into the season and ends a few months later, with no mention of playoffs or championships.  During this time, players are released/traded, get married, etc.  The main characters are a veteran catcher (Costner) brought in to help mature the young gun with the big fastball and no brains (Robbins).  Both are stellar performances by actors that were little known at the time.
It is a very funny movie.  The tone is maintained perfectly throughout the whole show, so you become absorbed and care about the characters, even the peripheral ones.  The parallel story, about the relationship between the main characters and the team's groupie (Sarandan) is also entertaining, amusing, and interesting.
I personally prefer the baseball story over the romance story - the romance well done, but standard.  The director, Shelton, was a minor league player for several years, and there are numerous little details that make the story ring true - time on the busses, meetings on the pitcher's mound, etc.
As for this DVD edition, there are not a lot of extras, except for a director's commentary.  It's almost more of a writer's commentary, as Shelton also wrote the story.  I'm always surprised at how candid directors are at pointing out scenes they don't like.  Especially interesting are his description of scenes that were cut (unfortunately, these scenes are not included as extras), and why they were axed.  He also relates the ""true stories"" behind a number of the antics that appear in the movie. There is one complaint of his that I can't agree with - he apologises a number of times for certain scenes that don't look as good as they could, but this is a strength of the movie.  A movie about the minor leagues should have an unpolished look - it adds to the authenticity.",974073600,12,1999,4.826979472140763
317042,5,630120798X,"The great thing about this movie is that it begins by presenting us with three fairly cliched characters, then flips them upside down to reveal that there's much more to them than first revealed.
Tim Robbins (as Epy Calvin ""Nuke"" Laloosh... what a delightfully preposterous name) begins as a totally unsympathetic character (so much so, that the first time I saw the movie I thought Tim's acting was awful).  He is the prodigal son, blessed with immense talents but a pea-brain.  Throughout, his mental midgetry is put on full display (witness his butchering of the song ""Try a Little Tenderness"", a hilarious scene).  But his saving grace, his golden moment, occurs near the end of the film when he purposefully mispronounces Crash's mantra 'fear and arrogance' as 'fear and ignorance', just to get under his skin.  It also reveals his newfound affection for the older man.  It's a great moment of personal growth, the pupil overtaking the teacher if you will.
Susan Sarandon (as Annie Savoy) thinks she has it all under control.  Every summer, she takes a rookie from the baseball team, and teaches him about sex, God, and Walt Whitman.  The locals all see her as some all-seeing gypsy-type.  And she sees herself that way too.  But her weakness shows when it begins to look like she's losing the tug-of-war for Nuke's attention to Crash.  Her vulnerability is made evident in the scene where she barges into Crash's hotel room while he's doing his ironing.  He challenges her (both mentally and sexually, as no one else in the film could) and she crumbles.  Instead of a baseball-goddess, she is revealed as nothing more than a lonely woman.  It is a touching moment.
And Kevin Costner (as the aforementioned Crash Davis) is just perfect.  Costner has not delivered a performance since that comes close to his work as Crash (witness his speech near the beginning listing all the things he believes in; it is a powerfully acted, not to mention written, scene).  He is charming, cool, and almost Zen-like in his knowledge of baseball mannerisms and manners.  But he is also incredibly flawed.  He is rapidly approaching the end of his career -- a career that led him to one brief cup of coffee in the major leagues.  That's his albatross: that with all his smarts and wit, it's young guns like Nuke who will enjoy all of the rewards that ""The Show"" has to offer, while he is left scrounging for work in the ""bus leagues"".  And his dalliance with Annie has caught him off-guard, for she is the only one who is able to strip away his cynical veneer and see his insecurities.
These are three great, fully formed characters, pulled off by three fine pieces of acting.
The movie is full of great moments; my favourites include the meeting on the mound scene (where they discuss wedding gifts and voodoo curses), the ""lollygaggers"" pep talk, and Crash's anti-hero retort to a 12-year old batboy who has just offered encouragement: ""Shut up!""  It's all wrapped up in Ron Shelton's wonderfully witty script, which manages to get both the baseball and the romance just right.  I suspect that anyone unaccustomed to the romance of baseball will have a tougher road to ""get"" this movie, but if you do, then it's quite a charming trip.",970012800,9,3224,4.762589928057554
317043,4,630120798X,"Bull Durham is a baseabll clasic.  Even if you don't like Baseball, I  would recomend this DVD for Director Ron Shelton's commentary.
I have  to say its some of the best, most interesting commentary about making a  film that's I've listened to.
I completely recomend it.",965520000,2,270,4.804347826086956
317044,5,630120798X,"This was the first ""grown up"" movie I ever saw by myself - that  I remember that almost 15 years later should tell you something.
Susan  Sarandon is Annie, a small town teacher who is a total baseball groupie.  Every year, she chooses a rookie and with her wisdom and, well, sex, helps  him mature and get through that scary first year.  This year, the choice is  either veteran minor-leaguer Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) or the rather  dimwitted player Crash calls ""Meat"" (Tim Robbins) - but Crash  refuses to ""try out"" and so Annie ends up with Meat.
However,  the sexual attraction is still there and Annie knows that what she DOESN'T  yet have with Crash is much more than what she DOES have with Meat so in  the end it all works out, sort of.
This is such a rich movie, wonderfully  acted by all three leads and a delight to watch over and over.",961718400,2,849,4.371794871794871

While it might (and I only say 'might') fall short in other areas (how realistic was this pseudo-menage-a-trois anyway?), it knows baseball like no one's business.  It offers insights to the average fan, and cuts a satirical but realistic  swath through the life of a minor league ball player. Most importantly, it  is ultimately a hugely enjoyable and entertaining story.",959644800,4,431,4.876712328767123

317047,5,630120798X,"Baseball is the best sport and ""Bull Durham"" is one of the best films about that sport. What is not to love? The dialogue is great, the cast (Tim Robbins, Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon) are all terrific, and  it's about two of the greatest things in the world: baseball and  love.
The latter being superior to the former, of course.
""Bull  Durham"" is the story of a hotshot pitching prospect named Nuke  (Robbins), his washed up catcher Crash, brought in to refine his talents  before going on to the big leagues (Costner), and Annie, the local woman  who has a curious relationship with both men (Sarandon). Good 'ol Nuke is a  typical sports star: hot-headed, arrogant with respect to his abilities,  resentful of criticism. But Crash and Annie are interesting,  three-dimensional characters with plenty of baggage, plenty of regret over  the roads not taken in their own lives and of the chances they weren't  given. The script cleverly mixes humor with dramatic dialogue. You laugh  one minute and cry the next. Sarandon says at the end of the film, the  world is ""made for those not cursed with self-awareness"". It is  one of the truest things I have ever heard in my entire life, and just one  of many moments of insight and wit in this film.
And there's  baseball!  What can be better than that?
This is a great movie. Not  just baseball but for life. Enjoy.",955152000,8,1368,4.652719665271967
317105,1,630120798X,"This movie was a complete waste of great talent, and an insult to baseball.  The entire movie was about a woman of 40, or so, trying to boost her ego.  Very disappointing.  I'm just glad I saw Kevin Costner and Susan  Sarandon in other films before seeing this one, or I would never have seen  this one.",955065600,4,303,4.245614035087719

Anyway, this adaptation of the life of minor league baseball players and a woman who is  drawn to rookies is both funny and in alot of ways true.  You don't have to  be a big baseball fan to love this movie as the comic wit of Costner,  Sarandon, and Robbins will keep you hooked.  Also, the storyline is very  interesting.
