8130405,4,B000GBES3S,"Kenneth Tabak's advice on inspecting a house before purchase could save viewers thousands of dollars, not to mention a lot of heartache years down the road when things begin to fall apart. Even though Tabak's expertise is in Southern-style homes [he works in North Carolina] and he focuses on brick built structures with chimneys and attics, those considering a bungalow in Burbank, a cottage in Kalamazoo, or a condo in Clearwater would still benefit from much of the information presented here. Tabak is an easygoing host who patiently explains what to look for in foundations, roofs, heating and cooling systems, and other vital features of any type of house. And you don't have to be a structural engineer to put Tabak's recommendations to use-in fact, he distinctly singles out those areas that should be inspected by experts and counsels potential homeowners to seek professional advice. Considering the astronomical cost of houses in today's high priced real estate market, this informative how-to should be a welcome addition. Recommended {J.
