7979199,5,B000085EER,Very good.  Holds your interest even if the idea has been explored in other shows.  I like Timothy Hutton as the FBI investigator.  He is a very good actor. I would really recommend others to see this.,1334016000,2,201,4.378378378378378
7979200,5,B000085EER,"WINDS OF TERROR is a realistic, terrifying what if movie.  Terrorists are releasing a deadly virus in various locations around the world.  We initially see its results on a cruise liner; then at a Chicago ball game.  People die horrible deaths, and the FBI is determined to stop a final outbreak in Washington, D.C.

Timothy Hutton offers a sincere performance as the FBI agent determined to catch the terrorist; Lane Smith is fine as his uncle who created the virus; and Vanessa L. Williams as a bioterror specialist is very good.  Director Robert Mandel keeps the tension high and this is one scary flick.",1099180800,4,607,4.798076923076923
7979201,4,B000085EER,"""Winds of Terror"" is a wonderful despliction of the what-if question.  It may not be a pretty movie, but the producers answer it in great detail.  These events are similar to past disease outbreaks.  The make-up team make the symptoms real looking.  The actors and the crew are great.  Though most of this film has been done before, it's still highly entertaining.",1060560000,8,364,4.806451612903226
