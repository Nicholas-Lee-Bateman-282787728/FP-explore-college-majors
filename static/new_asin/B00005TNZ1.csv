1661841,5,B00005TNZ1,"This is a technical info review, something I usually do not do.  My comments on the series are on each individual American released set. For those buying this copy with the late Andreas (G'kar) Katsulas on the cover art of the pilot, 2 things.  1) This is a region 2 copy so make sure you have a region free player to play it.  2)  This is the 1993 with Stewart Copeland's interpretation of the music.  In other words, the one that originally aired in first run syndication and has NOT been replayed this way since.  The 1998 revamped copy which aired for the first time on TNT before they bought the rights to show the 5th season first run and then the reruns has been released on DVD 3 times, the best copy of the 3 being in ""the movie collection"".  For those of you like me who wanted to compare the 2 on DVD but felt you had to borrow and burn a VHS copy of this one, now you have your chance to see them both side by side to compare notes.",1417046400,,944,4.0978260869565215
1661842,3,B00005TNZ1,"This is the original pilot to the Babylon 5 series, and in my opinion it should be included in the Season 1 set.  Yes, it's weaker than the show, and there are a few plot inconsistencies (how do you poison a Vorlon?), but it does a good job at introducing the world and the characters to the audience.  If you're into Babylon 5, you should watch this film at some point.  If you've never seen Babylon 5, and find yourself unimpressed with this film, be advised that it will get a lot better.  And if you find Sinclair too wooden, he gets replaced in season 2.  (Takashima, Lyta, and the doctor will get replaced immediately.)

1661847,1,B00005TNZ1,"Note: The version I am watching is 1 hour and 34 minutes long, so it is apparently the Special Edition 94 minute one.

My only knowledge of Babylon 5 comes from great and rave reviews about its great writing and storylines and story arcs, and the charges that ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" plagiarized the idea.

Hopefully the series lives up to its reception and to the reception its allegedly ripped-off Star Trek equivalent has received, because this intro movie is horrid on almost every level.

Starting on the most unfair level; the visual effects.  Considering this came out in 1993, it's unfair to complain about bad effects because CGI technology was very new.

But considering that this was also the time in which Star Trek was dominating the Sci-Fi circuit with TNG winding down and Deep Space Nine beginning, the look of the two shows from one to the two others is like the difference between a finely crafted guitar and a shoebox with fishing wire on it.

From what I hear and know, the only CG used in Star Trek at that point was for the phaser effects.  Everything else was standard visual effects and the use of models and miniatures.  By comparison, this TV movie uses full CG.

And it looks horrid.  In space, the ships all look flat, with no substance or shading and stiff, blocky shadows that look as artificial as everything else.  It's as if there are lights shining in all directions.  It's all on par with the sort of things you'd see in Doom or Duke Nukem 64, rendered again and again to completely remove any and all traces of realism, grit, or even believability from these shots.  Every time a shot from space is played, it's like having your head slammed into a table and jerked back up, a total break from the immersion and you're left gawking at how awful and pathetic that looked.

Moving on to the fairer things: The acting.

The acting is BAD.  The only person who is a decent actor is the Vorlon guy who was on Star Trek as a Romulan commander.  This Jeffrey Sinclair person sounds like his acting experience comes from watching TV and movies and then being given a script for the first time and told to act.  He's either completely emotionless or so horribly forced, it utterly kills scenes that are supposed to be tense or emotional.

But he's not alone.  The guy playing Garibaldi sounds almost exactly like Randal Graves in ""Clerks"", and even speaks in almost exactly the same tone and temperament.  It's impossible to take him seriously with the name of an Italian war hero and the voice of a snot-nosed punk clerk.

Londo Mollari, whose actor clearly IS an actor, but with hair that is two feet tall, fanning out the back of his head, and utterly bald everywhere else, I was shocked to learn he's supposed to be an alien.  Straight out from under the Iron Curtain, based on that scruffy ""Generic East European"" accent he chomps on so hammily, it's more annoying than humorous, if he's even supposed to be the humor character.

Takashima and the telepath, with all the personality of a goldfish between them, are somehow even worse than Sinclair's actor, with virtually all of Takashima's lines sounding as lifeless as a middle school drama student being asked to sight-read a monologue without any preparation.

All the rest are too stale and below average to warrant special attention, aside from the doctor's hilarity-enducing ""Now will someone please tell me what tha HELL is going on around here!"", but the description mentioned above, of amateur drama students acting for the first time pretty accurately describes everyone in every role, except for Andreas Katsulas and Peter Jurasik.

But maybe they all sound vapid and confused for the reason that they don't understand what the hell they're reading and speaking.  I know I don't.  ""What the hell is going on around here?"" is a pretty accurate statement for the entire first hour and 15 minutes, as names, alien species, and events are dropped liberally and at random, with almost no explanation or understanding, and immediate events unfolding involving an attempted poisoning of an ambassador and a shapeshifter apparently responsible.  Exactly what else is filing in the other 60 minutes of that 10 minute plotpoint is purely speculation on my part.

Don't misunderstand, I LOVE it when science fiction chooses not to dwell on exposition, going by either ""show, don't tell"" as with Battlestar Galactica, or letting relevant information be covered with relevant dialogue, or as Star Wars does, leave background information to be filled in (for better or worse) by expanded universe novels, video games, and comics, to make for a richer experience with the movies that is not needed to go along with it, as well as making more money by producing more work.

Whatever Babylon 5: The Gathering is doing in its first 75 of 94 minutes, it sure as hell ain't any of that.  Events unfold and you're expected to follow along, then try not to act surprised when something else happens that makes no sense or comes out of nowhere.  Add to that the horrifyingly bad acting, and far too many scenes of droning expository dialogue, and you're bored into submission long before you can figure out what is happening and why.",1276646400,,5209,4.758620689655173
1661848,4,B00005TNZ1,"Babylon 5 - The Gathering (Series Pilot Film) is one hour and thirty-three minutes long and was released on February 22, 1993. The movie deals with the opening of the space station Babylon 5. Think United Nations and you get the idea. All of the key ambassadors have arrived with the exception of one; Ambassador Kosh from the Vorlon Empire. Within minutes of coming off his ship Ambassador Kosh is poisoned. The rest of the movie deals with finding who poisoned Ambassador Kosh and why. We find out who did it; a Minbari from a renegade warrior caste but, we never find out why. Also we are introduced to the key characters in the series. Ambassador G'Kar from the Narn Regime, Ambassador Delenn from the Minbari Federation, Ambassador Londo Mollari from the Centauri Republic and we also get a brief glimpse into their history as well. When season one kicked off, major changes were done to the characters and new one are introduced as well. This is not a bad pilot episode. I am giving Babylon 5 - The Gathering a B+.",1236988800,,1020,4.6098901098901095
1661849,3,B00005TNZ1,"Every epic begins somewhere... and in ""Babylon 5's"" case, it was the TV movie/pilot ""The Gathering."" Like most pilots, it's kind of an awkward beginning (could the doctor and Lyta be more exaggerated?), but the first flowering of this now-classic TV show is a pretty solid one -- we've got murder mysteries, strange aliens, and a distinctly philosophical bent.

Ten years after the Earth-Minbari War ended, Babylon 5 is a political, social and diplomatic hub for all the assorted races -- most importantly, to avert future wars.  Despite the fact that half the ambassadors hate each other or are trying to cut deals, it's working well.

Now the newest ambassador -- a mysterious Vorlon named Kosh -- is about to arrive, as well as the new telepath Lyta Alexander (Patricia Tallman). But mere moments after his arrival, Captain Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) finds Kosh collapsed -- he's been poisoned, and may die. And as the doctor goes to extreme lengths to save him, Lyta scans his mind.

Unfortunately, she sees Sinclair doing the loathsome deed. Hoo boy.

And even more unfortunately, the Council (with two yeses, a no and an abstention) votes to send Sinclair to the Vorlon homeworld for trial. And security chief Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) starts discovering some disturbing clues -- and dead bodies -- that may mean Sinclair is innocent. But they have less than a day to find out who or what is framing the captain... and almost as importantly, why.

Most TV pilots are rather awkward compared to the actual series itself. In this case, ""The Gathering"" has a very different cast lineup, some vastly different alien prosthetics, and the first hints of the series' many subplots. In short, it's a bit like putting on new, stiff shoes for the first time.

But J. Michael Straczynski manages to whip up a solid sci-fi premise, with lots of old grudges, wars, extremely weird aliens (check out the full-body suit!), and a rather grimy space station the size of a moon. Moreover, he whips up a fairly solid whodunnit full of little twists and turns, and an assassin whose appearance can change into anything.

There are some points that could have been easily cut, such as Takashima rambling for a whole scene about coffee beans and what a rebel she used to be. But the entire movie tightens up in the second half, when Sinclair and Garibaldi start really homing in on the Bad Guy. It also has more of a sense of humour, such as Sinclair's last conversation with Delenn.

The cast in the pilot -- unlike in the series that followed -- is a pretty mixed bag. O'Hare is a pretty good commander (noble, upright, kind yet stern) with a mysterious blot in his past, and Doyle is a likable ordinary guy. Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik and Mira Furlan all do good jobs as well, and manage to give hints of their own personal ambitions and vendettas.

The downside is that three of the cast are, pretty simply, awful. Tamlyn Tomita doesn't radiate an iota of toughness or authority as Sinclair's second in command, and both Tallman and kindly doctor Johnny Sekka overact to a sometimes embarrassing degree (complete with dramatic pointing and cries of, ""He did it! I saw it! I SAW IT! I SAW IT!"").

""Babylon 5: The Gathering"" serves as a solid introduction to the classic sci-fi epic, marred only by some bad acting. But definitely worth watching... right before you check out the series.",1234051200,,3375,4.781786941580756

1661872,2,B00005TNZ1,"This is not a review of this specific title, but rather of Warner Brothers' ""TV Premiere DVD"" series as a whole.  I would like to make you aware of my issues with features that are apparently prevalent in ALL of the titles in this series, based upon my purchase of one of these titles (""The Flintstones - The Flintstone Flyer"").

Although the list of issues below was written specifically for The Flintstones DVD, I highly suspect that most (if not all) of it applies to this and all of the other titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series.  Be sure to check out The Flintstones page to see the photos that I uploaded which better illustrate the packaging and disc printing issues mentioned below.

-- The disc does not come in a plastic case, but rather in a cardboard sleeve which opens on the side.  I've purchased $1 public domain DVDs from no-name companies that came in plastic slim cases, so it's appalling that a $6 DVD from a big-name company would be done so cheaply.  Also, the sleeve has a hole at the top in the center where the peg would go for it to be hung on a rack like an action figure or toy.  The hole has been edited out of the promo photos that Warner Bros. gave Amazon to display for the DVDs.

-- The text on the disc is very faint and hard to read - another way Warner Bros. skimped on production costs.

-- The cheapness doesn't stop at the packaging.  The DVD does not contain a menu, not even a plain one.  Because of this, there's an interesting glitch that happens if you let the DVD play past the episode.  You see, after the episode plays, it goes to a FBI Warning on title 3, which then goes to the non-existent menu, so the player just hangs on a black screen.

-- They were even cheap in the placement of the chapters marks, which are placed every ten minutes (0:00, 10:00, and 20:00) no matter if it makes sense in the episode content for one to be there or not.

-- From what I've read, most (if not all) of the titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series were originally released on VHS and/or laserdisc, with these DVDs being done from the VHS and laserdisc masters.  The quality of The Flintstones DVD definitely appears to be better than VHS, so either it came from a laserdisc master, or not all of the titles were done from old home video masters.

Although at first I didn't mind paying $6 for one 26 minute Flintstones episode, that was before I knew that the DVD didn't even come in a plastic case.  Now that six dollars really seems like a rip-off.

1661873,4,B00005TNZ1,"A good pilot to an excellent series, Babylon 5 - The Gathering, brings to the screen the parallel stories of prominent people aboard a major station under Human control in neutral territory.

The setting is the Babylon 5 space station orbiting Epsilon 3.  The date is 2257, nine years after the Earth-Minbari War (one year before the series begins), and representatives from the four major space-faring races, the Centauri, Humans, Minbari, Narns, as well as numerous minor races have all gathered at B5 in a last effort at maintaining galactic peace.  The arrival, however, of the fifth major space-faring race's ambassador, the Vorlon Kosh, will result in quite a bit of turbulence...

Michael O'Hare, Mira Furlan, Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik, and the rest of the cast, carry out their performances well though one can tell that they are a bit uneasy, as is the case with most series in the beginning.  Eventually all the actors, without exceptions, will give it their 100% and it will really show!

My two questions are as to why the Centauri Republic is run by... an emperor, in which case it should be called an Empire since ""republic"" means the exact opposite, and as others have also pointed out, why is Chief of Security Garibaldi so similar in so many ways to Bruce Willis (!); was that coincidental or did it just turn out that way?

In any case Babylon 5 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection as it is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.

Having said this, even if the package is deceptive, it is still a well made murder mystery. It takes you on a tour of the station, and introduces all the characters without too much standing around talking as most pilots have.

The only reason this merits two stars is literally the content.  This is a editing of the movie that started it all for Babylon 5, laying the groundwork for a five year storyline.

The reason I did so was because that it said on the label that it was the original pilot episode from March 8, 1993. That version was only ever released on VHS not DVD. I was skeptical but for a few dollars I decided to take a chance.
Not to my surprise it was the TNT Special Edition not the original. The Gathering Special Edition much like the Star Wars Special Editions added scenes, deleted scenes and redid effects and dialogue. Strangely the creator of B5 J. Michael Straczynski was praised by his fans for doing so whereas Lucas was condemned for his changes.
The thing though that made this DVD worth getting after all was that they have reformatted the movie which was only made in 1:33:1 fullscreen to a widescreen presentation like they did the Kung Fu TV series DVD's even though the labeling on the back says it is in standard format like it's original exhibition.",1088035200,,1036,4.51595744680851

This is a waste of a few bucks unless you are going to buy everything b-5 that was ever made.  If not hold out for the Movie Box set due out soon.",1087430400,,477,4.042553191489362
1661913,3,B00005TNZ1,"This disc is simply a re-issue of the transfer originally used on the double-feature DVD that Warner Bros. used to ""test the market"" for ""B5"" on DVD a couple of years ago.  (The other half of the double-feature was the Minbari War prequel, ""In the Beginning"")
Essentially they took the existing laserdisc transfers, digitized them, and dropped it onto a DVD.  There were no extras, no Dolby Digital 5.1 remixes, nothing.  The version of ""The Gathering"" used was not the 1993 original but a substantial re-edit that series creator and executive producer J. Michael Straczynski oversaw in 1998 when TNT picked the series up for its fifth and final season.  This version restores footage cut by the director, deletes other material, replaces some CGI shots and adds a new score by series composer Christopher Franke.  (Who had not worked on the original pilot.)  The idea is to restore the film to something closer to JMS's original script, which was substantially altered to meet the demands of the studio, the director and the fledglig network. (Which, among other things, required that a total of 9 commercial breaks be written into the film, instead of the 6 that are standard for movies airing in a 2-hour timeslot.)
Now Warner Bros. is recycling the same transfer of the pilot as part of its ""try it, you'll like it"" series of low-cost discs designed to introduce potential buyers to its TV shows.  (Some discs contain a TV movie, as in this case, others a couple of individual episodes of a series.)  All come with a coupon good for $5.00 of one of the full season sets of the same season.  They are intended as cheap ""sampler"" discs to promote existing series releases.
This disc has nothing at all to do with the remastered version of ""The Gathering"", with its Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack and commentary track by JMS, which will be included with the boxed set of five ""B5"" TV Movies being released on August 14th.  That's a version that will be snapped up by people who are already committed fans of the show.  (And who probably bought the original release of ""The Gathering"" and ""In the Beginnning"" on DVD a couple of years ago, as I did.)  This is for those who are just curious about the series and want a cheap way to check it out.  Let's face it - at around $6.00 (less at some retailers) the disc costs less than a rental at a lot of video stores - and if you like it enough to buy the series it basically costs you a buck (or nothing at all) thanks to the coupon savings.
So if you're already a ""B5"" fan, give this disc a miss and pre-order the TV movie set.  But if you're just curious, this isn't a bad way to sample the show - although I must say the transfer is a little darker and grainier than I think it should be.  The episodes look a bit better.
And no, despite the way Sci-Fi aired it, ""TG"" is not and never was shot with widescreen in mind.  Although that was already planned for the series, JMS and company decided to save time and money while shooting the pilot by going with the conventional 4:3 ratio, switching to the Super35 process which allowed them to frame for 4:3 and 16:9 simultaneously when the series started shooting, many months after the pilot was completed.",1086998400,,3200,4.539130434782609
1661914,4,B00005TNZ1,"I still remember the first time I saw this pilot episode on television. Having watched the Star Trek franchises for many years, I thought they were the benchmark against which all other science fiction storylines would be compared. My first impression of the B5 pilot, ""The Gathering,"" seemed to bear that out.
I felt this B5 storyline was too dark, and I especially disliked the make-up of Mira Furlan's character, D'Lenn. She looked TOO evil, especially her chin. How could a prominent character like hers project a sense of compassion for the human race? ""Humans form communities, and from that comes a strength that no race can defeat."" She would make a statement like this later in the series. So, it would do her character an injustice to make her look like an evil and malevolent person.
Then there was G'Kar -- he, too, had an evil look to him. Granted, his race is malevolent and seeks only to advance its personal agenda, and it has suffered dearly at the hands of its former masters, the Centauri. But I got no sense that there was any redeeming quality in G'Kar, and that he would just be a stereotypically evil person.
Then there was Londo Mollari -- I thought of him as a ""Broom Head."" He looked like all he was good for was sweeping up messes. Nor did he project a sense of authority that was due his position. In effect, he was nothing more than a clown.
I also didn't like the musical score for the original pilot episode. It made Babylon 5 feel like a funeral parlour, rather than ""Our last, best hope for peace.""
In essence, I felt that ""The Gathering"" was a waste of time, and that it had no future on television.
However, having seen how the five-year storyline unfolded after that pilot episode, I really started to appreciate JMS's vision.
In addition, when the new version of ""The Gathering"" came out on DVD in 2001, I felt that JMS had really done a good job of cleaning the pilot episode up. There was a new sound track that didn't feel as depressing, although it still retained that dark nature that I came to appreciate even better than I originally did. Then there are the additional scenes that were put in, especially those with Sinclair and his girlfriend. These added more depth to the plot.
I was also happy to see in the series that Mira Furlan lost the evil chin and that the facial features of Andreas Katsulas' character were also softened to make him look less malevolent.
All in all, this new version of the pilot episode is much better than its original broadcast in 1993. While I cannot give it five stars out of five, it definitely deserves four stars for having been cleaned up.",1083888000,,2622,4.545454545454546
1661915,4,B00005TNZ1,"Because it was not until this year that I finally got around to watching ""Babylon 5"" I watched this pilot movie, ""The Gathering,"" after watching the prequel movie, ""In the Beginning,"" which was made four years later and provided the back story on the Earth-Minbari War.  Anybody who adopts a similar approach to the television series are immediately confronted with the giant hole that exists between the end of ""In the Beginning"" and this pilot episode. The station is being run by Michael O'Hare (Jeffrey Sinclair), with Laurel Takashima (Tamlyn Tomita) and Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) making up the other two sides of the power triad. Sinclair is the important character because of the role he played in the end of the Earth-Mindari war in the prequel. However, we learn nothing more about that aspect of this character, although there are some veiled references made to it by some Mindari characters.
The pilot (essentially a two-part episode) basically focuses on a mystery in that the Vorlon ambassador arrives and almost immediately collapses on the point of death. There are all sorts of delicacies involved in not opening up his environment suit, but that becomes secondary when Commander Sinclair becomes the prime suspect. The point of the pilot is to introduce the cast of characters and the politics of this particular science fiction universe, but doing it in the context of a mystery is rather strange. The scene that carries most of this weight is the hearing where G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) makes a motion to extradite Sinclair to the Vorlon homeworld for a trial. The vote, not only in terms of how it was put together but how it is justified after the fact, is what provides the best insights we have into the ""Babylon 5"" universe.
One running bit is why ""Babylon 5"" is the fifth and last Babylon ship. Sinclair says it has something to be with human stubbornness, but my question was why the name ""Babylon"" was used. I understand the appropriateness given all the species that come together on the vessel, but you would think that one of those species would get their hands on the book of Genesis at some point and figure out that even if this is not a veiled insult it is at least a joke at their expense.
Both the prequel and the pilot for ""Babylon 5"" show potential for the series. The less than stellar plot line for ""The Gathering"" does not matter given what is being established as a foundation for future episodes. Between the two movies there are a lot of characters and apparently more to. So at the end of these two tales I do not have a real feel for what ""Babylon 5"" is going to be about, but I do have a sense that it is moving in an interesting direction, especially since the aliens are so much more interesting than the humans at this point.",1081555200,,2780,4.673469387755102
1661916,3,B00005TNZ1,"Many are called... and each has his place in the events to follow. We meet Sinclair, the first Commanding officer of B5. A decent man with a ""hole in his mind"". In the past he has fought bravely on the Line, but his *real* past -or future- lies a thousand years away. We also meet Garibaldi, the security chief, who has allowed his addiction to ruin his life numerous times in the past. This is his chance to make a difference, if he can stay sober. We see Dellen, the Minbari ambassador, with slightly different features that the series, and more ruthless as well. We also see Mollari, the Centauri ambassador and someone we may like. Just as we may dislike the Narn ambassador, G'Kar, and imperialistic and warlike individual. But first impressions can be deceiving.
Because, as G'Kar states in a later episode: ""no one here is what he appears""...
In this pilot episode, the story goes like this: The arrival of the Vorlon ambassador, Kosh, is almost at hand. Everyone expects this with great anticipation, because no one so far has seen a Vorlon (and lived, if I may add). However, when Kosh sets foot (?) on the station an attempt is made on his life. Sinclair is accused for this, and he has to set things straight. Otherwise, the future (and the past) of this station is in grave danger.
Apart from the great storyline, the depth in character development and the philosophical threads, this series has exceptional effects and make up. The alien races look really alien, even dress and behave as such. This is the best SF series you can ever find.",984700800,,1552,4.606498194945848
1661917,4,B00005TNZ1,"The story in The Gathering led us to believe that the future of the earth would not be so very different than the present, as far as the culture and the emotions of humans.  The special effects were fantastic.  The acting  was great overall, especially from Commander Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) who  showed us a wide range of expressions and feelings in a very short amount  of time.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the  makeup...but it's possible that I am only comparing that area of the story  to the later excellent makeup jobs done throughout the series.",924393600,,582,4.58252427184466

7953739,5,B00005TNZ1,"Not sure where or if this review will show up regarding VHS or DVD, but this is just a comment or three on the subject of the ""original"" 1993 pilot version vs the ""revised"" 1998 special edition.  Mostly the efforts to find a copy of the 1993 release.

As a fan of the series, I was hoping to locate a DVD-Quality version of the actual 1993 release, but on reading the wealth of information provided by other Amazon commenters, figured this was a needle in a field of haystacks.  Rumor has it that only a certain UK Region 2 DVD version had the 1993 cut, or possibly some of the non-english language ones IF those came with an English track (or not?).  Not every Seller in Europe ships to the US, so not very promising.  Had I tried looking ten years ago the odds would be better, but a little late now.  There were also rumors that some streaming services have/had the 1993 release, but those might have been phased out years ago.

While the odds were slim, it seemed the trick was locating a DVD that listed ""Stewart Copeland"" with the music credit as his music was used in the 1993 edition. The 1998 release featured music by Christopher Franke, so just narrow the focus to DVDs that listed ""Copeland"".  Going back to comments section, noticed this would not be much help as others mentioned DVDs listing Copeland (1993) were - when viewed - the special edition (1998).  I already own the Gathering/Beginning dual DVD, and noticed that the music credit - listed on the back of the dvd case - went to Copeland.  Popped the disc in the player.... ""TNT Presents a Special Edition..."" so had proof in hand that the credits on the back could be a mite misleading/confusing.

Confusing needle in a field of haystacks aside, there was also talk about certain UK box sets possibly having the 1993 version.  Re-purchase the whole series in region 2 on the possible chance of the 1993 version being included?  I also looked at the page for the UK DVD release of The Gathering, and the description went into detail about it NOT being the 1993 version, so another likely dead end.  Those 1993 Region 2 DVDs are out there somewhere, but would have to view it first to confirm it was the true ""1993"" version.  Not really worth random overseas purchases with such a low chance of success.

That left VHS. But still hunting for a needle amongst the haystacks.  However one Amazon commenter left a useful clue that the ""Columbia House"" VHS edition was the 1993 cut.  Several VHS versions were available here on Amazon, and as luck would have it one of the Sellers posted pictures of a (used) VHS copy of The Gathering which happened to include a shot of the back cover with a teeny tiny ""Columbia House"" logo visible in the lower left corner.  Ordered it.  Was a bit worried when pieces of plastic fell out of the shipping envelope, but only the plastic tape holder had been crushed in shipping.  Now have the 1993 release - in awesome VHS quality.

It is nice to have finally re-seen the ""true original"" pilot of the series, but after a quick rewatch would say hands down that the 1998 version is much, much better.  Some scenes (like the infamous ""alien zoo"") are cut and other scenes are added back in.  Personally I prefer the music from the 1998 edition as it is more in line with the excellent music from the rest of the series.  Someone uploaded about 4-5 minutes of the 1993 version's intro to Youtube (still there in Sept 2016), so one can get a feel for the music used.  The clip includes a cut of the station spinning from a longer distance out before zooming into to CnC, and the reverse shot is used at the end of the 1993 version.

If a re-issue of the entire series (blu-ray) is ever done, it would be nice if the 1993 cut was included, but for $6.00 this 20+ year old VHS edition wasn't too bad of a substitute for the sake of curiosity for the original release.  Just need to dig an intact tape holder out of storage to replace the smashed one.  :)

For the sake of extra trivia, the version of ""The Gathering"" on the dual dvd Gathering/Begining release only had a ""cast listing"" for added features.  The ""Complete Movie Collection"" version's release included a commentary track from JMS, so if one has a choice between the two versions, get the one from the ""Movie Collection"" for the commentary track.",1474588800,,4305,4.487804878048781
7953740,3,B00005TNZ1,"I am a big fan of the Babylon 5 series, but I felt cheated by this release. Basically  this was old, existing footage re-digitized and plopped onto a DVD. The audio was not remastered into digital, they added nothing else to the disc either. This series screams for more extras, and after so many years running, you know there has to be many still not seen. So why is there nothing else on this disc?

Also, this is not the original pilot from the TV series as the box seems to indicate, which is what I hoped for. Yes, like so many, I have it on video tape, and I wanted a replacement. This was not it. It seems to be the mash up re-edited footage for the TNT introduction done late in the 90's, which was re-edited with extra footage, some original scenes cut, new music, and some newer CGI in places. Not exactly what they advertised.",1464652800,,837,4.291139240506329
