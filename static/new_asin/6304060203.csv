8277096,4,6304060203,As a teacher I find this whole series (save one) to be a great way to introduce students to composers.  This movie in particular captured the interest of my students.  They enjoyed the music of Strauss which is played throughout the movie and the story was quite good.  Because of this they wanted to hear more of Strauss' music and learn more about his life.,1083024000,,359,4.492307692307692
