7851894,5,6303595685,I remember seeing this special a loooooong time ago and recording in onto a VHS tape.  A group of us would watch it over and over and it never got old.  We still quote bits from it all these years later and I'm so happy I found it on Amazon.  Had same old friends over recently to watch and we laughed until we cried.  Such a shame he's gone. Great memories after all these years. RIP Mr. Jeni...you left us too soon.,1391731200,,417,4.048780487804878

Wish it was available on DVD, but since it isn't, I bought it in whatever form I could. I want to own everything that was ever recorded by him.",1265328000,2,255,4.3125

RIP Mr. Jeni.  We miss you already.",1247443200,,155,4.066666666666666
7851897,4,6303595685,His first stand up show for Showtime was one of his best.  His jokes were hillariouslly funny.  Another good title to look for is Richard Jeni's HBO Special Platypus Man.,913593600,5,170,4.633333333333334
