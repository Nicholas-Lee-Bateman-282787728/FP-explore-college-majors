2747215,2,B000MTFDBK,"Popular children's book author Claire Holloway (Gabrielle Anwar) is tormented by nightmares. It is about a spooky mansion and the surrounding marsh and in the dream she always has to witness something very disturbing, which is getting worse every night. Following advice from her therapist (and watching a TV program), she moves into a farmhouse in the countryside that looks exactly like the one in her dreams. And of course, she soon learns that the house is haunted.

Claire's decision to live in the house seems quite a drastic method to face her fear, but she is helped by a kind local resident, paranormal phenomena consultant Geoffrey Hunt (Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker). They investigate the strange occurrences in the house and the marsh, but the process is not particularly new or unique.

""The Marsh"" has right ingredients to make a good ghost story - good actors, good photography and good production designs - but they forgot one thing: good script. The story is derivative and the film is not scary. The film becomes interesting in the final chapter, but the wait is too long.

Forest Whitaker gives a solid performance (as always) and Justin Louis is also effective as support, but even these talented actors cannot do much in the predictable plot and narrative that include typical sound effects, flashbacks and a creepy little girl in white. How many times have we seen creepy little girls since ""The Ring""?",1203292800,8,1424,4.974789915966387

An American Haunting is another good break in the monotany.,1177804800,11,359,4.714285714285714
2747221,3,B000MTFDBK,"THE MARSH is yet another scary movie to satisfy the apparently inexhaustible demand for fright films of this genre.  It is obviously a low budget film that suffers from a silly script resurrecting tired themes of communication with ghosts and the intervention of paranormal specialists.

Successful children's book author and illustrator Claire Holloway (Gabrielle Anwar) is besieged by recurrent nightmares that prompt her therapist to recommend a sabbatical, advice she heeds as she moves out into the country to a little creepy town called Marshville.  She rents a old house near the marsh from a woman Mercy (Brooke Johnson) and discovers from the local newspaper editor Noah (Justin Louis) that the town is riddled with history of hauntings following the disappearance of a little girl into the marshes, the victim of sexual assault that has never been adequately investigated.  Claire's time in her new 'home' is racked with appearances of the dead little girl and her muddy perpetrator and she finally seeks the help of a Paranormal expert Hunt (Forest Whitaker) who helps her solve the etiology of Claire's nightmares and provides an exit for the ghosts.

Most of the film is dark with poor Claire just wandering around the creepy house with her open-mouthed/wide-eyed frightened look, avoiding the flying detritus caused by the angry spirits that haunt her. Gabrielle Anwar is beautiful to look at but is not really called upon to act.  Likewise Forest Whitaker is paralyzed by an inept script that even this fine actor can't overcome.  The music is the canned, synthesizer  variety and the camera work is jerky and gets in the way of the story.  This is a movie for avid fans of scary flicks who can overlook the multiple production and writing problems.  Grady Harp, April 07",1177718400,10,1786,5.04421768707483

2747310,2,B000MTFDBK,"I'm no medical expert, but from a purely clinical viewpoint it seems a big stretch that an individual could block out the entirety of a life trauma of that magnitude and then carry on with her life and grow up as though nothing had ever happened.
While I understand that although the trauma was deeply buried in her subconscious, hence the nightmares and influence upon her literary style; there remain gaps of logic within the storyline too obvious to ignore.

Her behavior and or acting is strangely episodic and uneven; conveying a detached and sanguine attitude in scenes where one expects a more robust reaction to certain events and interaction with the psychic and other characters. The obverse side of the coin is also demonstrated and only adds to the viewers frustration with comprehending the full extent of the plots intention.

Mr. Whitaker is disappointing but I would venture to guess that he did the best he could with the scripted character possessed with an oddly jovial and almost nonchalant approach to his own gifts as well as the situation as a whole.

There are fleeting glimpses of brilliance trying to break through on occasion, but the ending is too silly and predictable.

I would highly recommend watching Kevin Bacon in ""Stir of Echoes"" instead.",1437177600,2,1274,4.911627906976745

2747325,4,B000MTFDBK,"The Marsh is a pretty good horror even though there's a couple things that feel really wrong, but a clichd idea to boot.  That being the way events unfold in relation to the storyline.  I'll get to that below.  Gabrielle Anwar plays the role of a single woman who decides to spend her vacation in a farmhouse out in the country because she's been having strong haunting visions that draw her to the place.  Hey we've seen this story a thousand times huh?  A single woman travelling alone either desires to get away from a hectic lifestyle and finds herself in an adventurous mood for exploration, or in this case she's a writer/author who just wants to get an answer to a mysterious situation.

Gabrielle meets up with a couple people who work at the convenience store downtown, one of which she has flashbacks that something awful happened between the two of them, the other more frequent character Louis Ferreira who desires to have dinner and obviously start a relationship with Gabrielle even though she's obviously not interested.  The most notable is the friendship between Gabrielle and Forest Whitaker's character.  He's a paranormal investigator and can explain the mysterious events in the house.  Louis can explain them too but he's apparently too determined to get to know Gabrielle better, so his mind is elsewhere.

The horror comes when either a mysterious little girl appears inside the farmhouse with psychotic looking demonic-eyed adults, or when things come out of the swamp outside with the freakiest looking scarecrow I've ever seen hanging back there.  This movie relies heavily on loud effects whenever the smallest camera movement occurs.  This can be annoying, but also clever when you think about it because the things that you wouldn't even give a second thought suddenly become scary and make you jump!

I mention in the opening paragraph there's one thing that seems off.  That would be the way ghosts such as the little girl and the adults suddenly appear inside Gabrielle's house and develop elaborate stories, and neither Gabrielle or Forest show any fear whatsoever.  Instead they stand by and act like they're watching a mystery plot develop, lol.  These are GHOSTS people!  BE SCARED!  Don't grab popcorn and enjoy the show!  The dark energy that develops whenever the little girl is around can sometimes lead to memorable scenes, such as the one involving the farm lady who turns around to notice an angry horse RIGHT behind her which gave me the creeps big time, and soon after the farming equipment hanging from the ceiling comes raining down on top of her.  Thanks little girl!

Overall there's some unusualness pertaining to the way certain ghost activity just EXPLODES out of nowhere which can feel like overkill (ha, overkill in a horror movie!) and it's funny that Gabrielle and Forest sometimes stand by and watch ghosts communicate, but there's also a fair share of atmosphere, interesting characters and a solid mystery/horror storyline overall that needs to be taken into consideration.",1432252800,,3033,4.990059642147117
2747326,3,B000MTFDBK,"The only reason I'm giving three stars is because of Forrest Whitaker.  But even he couldn't make this story great.  First of all Gabrielle Anwar is a horrible actress, and she was even worse than normal in this movie.  Seriously woman speak up and stop mumbling!  I could barely even hear her dialogue.  And her feigned moodiness seriously got on my nerves.

This is certainly not the worst movie - but it feels and reads like a Lifetime Movie Network production, I'm personally very surprised Whitaker signed up for it...but hey actors gotta make some money.",1430179200,,560,4.78125

I liked the atmosphere in the small town with a big creepy house sitting alone.  Also the camera angles were nice.  They stretched in some of the hall shots and over head views were given in tight spots.  I also liked the way the camera focused on the door with the glass rose.  I also liked the mystery the movie revolved around.  The ghosts were done nicely.

2747350,3,B000MTFDBK,"I had mixed feelings watching this movie. The Marsh is not an original horror movie as I kept comparing it to movies like Stir of Echoes, Dark Water etc as I watched it. That being said, it has an interesting though not remarkable premise, and is well-shot. Gabrielle Anwar [who seems to be in quite a few horror movies these days] plays a children's book author, Claire Holloway who keeps having disturbing nightmares about her childhood and events she no longer remembers as having occured. Upon seeing a familiar place on tv, she ventures out to a small town in Westmoreland County, Marshville, where she leases a house she finds disturbingly familiar.

It doesn't take long for Claire to encounter spooky entities and experience disturbing visions. She enlists the aid of a spook consultant, Geoffry Hunt [Forest Whitaker] and he helps her discover the truth behind Claire's visions. It appears that Claire's 'return' to the town of Marshville has unleashed supernatural entities that are seeking revenge for a tragedy long past and Claire is somehow in the center of it.

The effects are good for what I assume is a low-budget movie - the entities look creepy enough, and the scares are the usual blink and you'll miss it kind. The movie also has a sufficiently bleak and menacing atmosphere, especially in the scenes where the entities wreak havoc.

As for the acting, both Anwar as Claire and Whitaker as Hunt do a credible job with the script they are given, though I felt this role was far beneath Whitaker's talent [this movie was before The Last King of Scotland for which he deservedly won an Oscar].

True horror fans who feel they deserve better may not appreciate this as much, but I felt it was worth a rental and the story held my attention till the end.",1216080000,4,1771,4.740259740259741

8171861,4,B000MTFDBK,"This was a not bad but not great 2006 horror film. I generally liked it but it had some problems that kept me from loving it.

The story centers on a well-known childrens writer named Claire Holloway (played by the beautiful and well-cast Gabrielle Anwar, who had a winsome, haunted look that was perfect for the role, as well as coming off as capable and more than willing to do what was needed in the story).

The viewer discovers that Claire suffers from nightmares involving ghosts, a marsh, and a strange house and has undergone a sleep study about it. While at home watching TV she sees something that causes to her research online a place she doesnt believe she has been to before, Rose Marsh Farm in Westmoreland County, a place that looks just like the home in her nightmares. Though it is not something I would do, Claire decides to rent the farm for her vacation (?). The farm is located near a marsh, located next to a scary scarecrow practically right outsider her door and has in the past attracted birdwatchers and photographers. In truth it was sort of picturesque and at times the cinematography was beautiful.

While staying at the farm house Claire starts to have visions or dreams, sees ghosts of a scary teenage boy and a younger, scary (frightened but not malicious maybe?) girl, and as typical for this type of film, starts to get to know and even befriend some of the locals, gradually finding out that the home and the marsh especially were the site of ghost stories and two deaths, eventually finding out that the deaths are the older boy and the younger girl she encounters again and again in her rented home.

During the course of the movie Claire is befriended by the local newspaper publisher/reporter Noah Pitney (played by Louis Ferreira) and as the ghosts become undeniable in their surprisingly physical presence in Claires rented home, a local paranormal expert by the name of Geoffrey Hunt (going by the name Hunt, played by Forest Whitaker). There are other people in the story, all having varying degrees to do with what happened twenty years ago with those two dead kids, including and especially Noah.

The movie becomes a detective story at this point, as Claire and Hunt work to understand who the ghosts are, why they died, why they are upset, and what role the various people in the small nearby town had in their deaths. Though everyone in town seems to know each other, Hunt seems a bit of an outsider (which makes sense for the story, as if he knew everything it wouldnt have been much of a mystery).

The good includes some decent jump scares, eerie imagery of the house temporarily remaking itself when the ghosts appear to look like it did twenty years ago when the two kids died, the good casting of Noah (who seemed a decent, affable, charming man not out of place in a Hallmark movie romance), the sometimes beautiful photography of the marsh (especially at night), some good and subtle use of a rose motif at times, and again the good casting of Claire, who was likable, compelling, and came off as a haunted person herself.

The bad includes a problem of suspension of disbelief with Claire, who seems to just shrug off very physical and undeniable appearances with actual ghosts, not having a good answer when various people in the town ask why she cares about the ghosts (reasonably pointing out she could just leave), some character inconsistences with Hunts character (who at one point said he doesnt believe in ghosts and then not a minute later basically says he does, just not calling them ghosts), a lack of explanation as to why the ghosts start killing people (other than perhaps because Claire is present in the town now), the fact that everybody in the movie just about had something to do with those deaths 20 years ago,  that Claire always seems to be able to pull out an apparently never been folded sketch she made of the ghost but I don't remember seeing her having it in her hand before it was used in a scene, a flashback scene that while mostly was well cast had one person who looked really nothing like their present day incarnation, and the fact that the marsh wasn't anything of the kind, with the initial view of it basically being a cornfield (though I could see locals calling it a marsh owing to tradition or the fact that the name of the farm is Rose Marsh Farm) or later a swamp (marshes lack trees, swamps have trees, though again people can certainly call things by the wrong name). I won't say much about this, but the central mystery about Claire was well answered, I am not entirely sure I bought the mystery, or rather not that it occurred but instead why it was so poorly known to Claire.

Not a bad film at all, it had some gruesome but not gory deaths, some decent but not fantastic jump scares, and was not a bad way to pass part of an evening.",1524528000,,4839,4.5720876585928485
