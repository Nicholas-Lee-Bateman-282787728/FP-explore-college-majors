7536354,3,B017XK3TCA,"This is my favorite show, which I give a hearty 100% to, but not to this Blu Ray set.. While the video quality is great, seasons 3 and 4 have a weird menu compared to the other seasons, which doesn't allow you to pick an episode, but forces you to fastforward through previous episodes to get to the one you want. They only display a ""Special Features"" menu or ""Play All"". Season 4 also cut out the ""Then"" sequences so I couldn't watch the finale recap ruining my tradition. Sure I can listen to ""Carry On Wayward Son"" anytime, but it still took away from the experience... :( Might have to buy 3 and 4 separate in order to skip being annoyed.",1470787200,19,643,4.278688524590164

7536360,5,B017XK3TCA,"Slightly earlier than the last time, this new UK box set of Seasons 1-10 of the splendid SUPERNATURAL series is finally available. Previous box set was released last June, so, this new one arrives a little early, though late compared to the US one. Late but great, however, as buyers of these sets are compensated by the high quality in all aspects. The packaging is stunning, with all 10 standard, clear blue amaray cases housed in a glossy, sturdy slide-off box set, featuring all 218 episodes, plus special features. Each Season contains the Episodes and bonus features from the separate blu-ray Season releases (except for Easter eggs and some image galleries), and comes with an inside booklet listing credits and summaries. A compact, comprehensive and stylish box set, absolutely worth buying. Whether a fan, a casual viewer of the show or a collector, this is a flawless item absolutely worth buying. Here are the contents analytically:

Note: The aspect ratio in all Seasons is 1.78:1. Japanese audio is only available when player menu language is Japanese. The box set's total run time is 9,222 minutes.

8740937,5,B017XK3TCA,"Yeah.  What's to say.  Ten seasons of kick-ass awesome episodes, nice thick cardboard box, each season in an individual plastic case identical to what you get buying one at a time.  The corner of the box is smashed in a little, typical of how these dicks package such.  The mouth breathers in shipping just don't get it.  The box is part of the collection, not a shipping box.  It should have been packaged better, to prevent damage to the collection box.  But this happens all the time, I have given up on that battle, you can't win against an army of morons who stick stuff in packages for a living.  It's a great collection.",1535500800,,627,4.43859649122807

8740946,3,B017XK3TCA,"5 stars for Supernatural, the show.  2 stars for glitchy Blue-Ray discs.  The Road Map special feature doesn't function properly, and freezes the Blue-Ray player, which can't even be turned off via the remote.  I have to unplug the player and restart the disc to re-navigate to the Road Map, to get maybe one or two little videos to play before it locks up again.  Season three discs never show the menu.  They are BD-ROMs (whatever that means). The disc automatically starts playing the episodes, from the beginning, but because there's no menu, you have to fast forward (or use the jump to next scene function) to get to another episode. Once you get to the special features section, you cannot navigate back to the episodes. You can, however, at least turn off the player via the remote, and start over again from the beginning.  On the plus side, you can watch all the episodes and features, albeit in an annoyingly roundabout fashion. I'm only on season 3.  Can't wait to see what sort of torturous route will be required in subsequent seasons.",1513641600,4,1049,4.699453551912568
