thought we were right in the middle of the
Oktoberfest. My husband seemed to never stop laughing.
It's a wild party. I particularly enjoyed the Prague
segment. I have seen many travel videos of Prague, but
this video was particularly special. The Czech lady in
the video is great. She really knows how to tell the
story of Prague. I will share this video with friends.
It's like a double feature.",1190764800,,448,4.6125
