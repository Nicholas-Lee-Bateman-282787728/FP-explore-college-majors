208452,1,6300134938,"The Region 2 DVD of Alain Resnais' ""Providence"" (or should I say David Mercer's) shown here being the Manga Films Spanish edition, I must warn, since all the reviews refer to the film, and certainly not to the DVD, that it is not - as the film was written, acted & filmed - in English... but dubbed into French. That's why I keep waiting for a good DVD, in its original version, without Gielgud's voice replaced by another.

208453,5,6300134938,"I too saw this movie at the theatre back in '77 and although it disappeared from the popular media, I never forgot it. Like Brideshead Revisited it lives forever in the mind's eye, and dwells like a black hole in the core of the psyche. I was especially moved by Gielgud's devastating line at the end of the movie. He knows he will be dying at any moment and has made peace with his children. Then he pours a glass of wine and looking death full in the face, he says, ""I think there is time for just one more."" It sounds like nothing, and yet Gielgud makes of it everything.
If you don't feel like paying $120 for a PAL DVD, this movie is available for download on the BT sites.
You might also enjoy a book that was written with Gielgud in mind as the aging licentious Rector of All Saints Church:

208454,5,6300134938,I remember this forever -- I saw this as a college student and it made such an impression I made my parents drive 2 hrs. to see it with me; and then saw it again with my roommate. I remember it as poignant and hilarious and some of the best writing ever done. I wish I could buy it to see it again. One of my all time favorites.,1203206400,2,328,3.7681159420289854
208455,4,6300134938,"What a terrific movie this is. Sweet, sad, funny, a real treasure. I saw this at school in a class taught by Robert Coover's son. Had to wonder if there were parallels between my teacher's relationship with his father and the famous-writer father & son in this film. Haven't seen it since and I would sure love to. I liked it ten times better than Hiroshima Mon Amour or Last Year In Marienbad. Some of the lines are really hilarious, like here is this old fart up at night remembering his wife who committed suicide years before and all he can say is, ""Ah, Molly, Molly, your breasts were a biological triumph!"" Great stuff. I've taken off one star because occasionally the dialogue becomes stilted & self-referential, unreal basically and plain annoying. The story itself ends very nicely and the entire cast is just about perfect. Please bring this ignored treat back to us.",1186876800,,877,4.701298701298701
208456,5,6300134938,"I viewed this film repeatedly in 1977, drawn by the imagery and by the narrative--which seemed to mystify many critics at the time. Some called it ""pretentious""; that's what Americans always say when they can't figure out what the French are up to. 30 years later, the narrative structure isn't any more complex than Pulp Fiction, or perhaps The Hours. During one long night a dying artist (John Gielgud) contemplates plot options for his last book. Memories of his life, and his children (whom he loves too well, or possibly loathes) intrude on his creative efforts. John Gielgud carries most of the movie. What could have been a dreary or ponderous subject is rather buoyant and clever with Gielgud as the difficult author. And then the movie is just beautiful, and beautifully whimsical. Does art imitate life? Does life imitate art? Great subject, great movie, great director: where's the DVD?",1183161600,5,897,4.986666666666666
208457,5,6300134938,"Many filmmakers and critics consider this to be the best film of its time.  Not only are the performances brilliant, but a great deal can be learned about the language and mechanics of cinema by watching this movie very carefully.  You will learn something new every time.

208458,5,6300134938,"...until someone releases ""Providence""!
 It's a film that should stand next to Resnais' ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"", Godard's ""M&eacute;pris"", and... Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"". Beautiful classical cinema, yet with narrative and visual invention that sets it far from any dull psychological and social chit-chat. Anyone interested in crossroads between reality, dreams, obsessions, hopes and decay should enjoy this immersion in Clive Langham's stream of consciousness. I myself have been looking for a ""moral language"" eversince I saw the film...",1081296000,4,547,5.924050632911392
208459,5,6300134938,"This is, to my mind, one of the four or five best films of the seventies, and one that continues to give pleasure and inspiration.  It's a shame that it isn't better known in the US, and scandalous that it hasn't been issued on DVD.",1050105600,13,232,4.155555555555556
208460,5,6300134938,"An oldie but goodie (1969). This film has been one of my favorites since presenting it via a film society 22 years ago. That audience seemed to enjoy it as well.
This unique film possesses some of the most alive English language dialogue to ever hit the screen. Incorporated within the stream of consciousness visuals of master French director Alain Resnais (his first work in English), this film, written by playwright David Mercer, delivers the audience into the mind of a dying and somewhat bitter author (Sir John Gielgud) as he attempts to write one last work of fiction through a painful and sleepless night of rectal pain, albeit increasingly under the influence of an alcoholic beverage. As his minds clouds, his script becomes confused, often with comedic effect.
While sad, bitter sweet, moving and often serious, this film possesses wonderful humor. The recurring images of the ""famous footballer"" (David Warner), Ellen Burstyn's slicing of a phallic-shaped vegetable while accusing her husband of infidelity and the delivery of Dirk Bogard's pithy lines all conspire to amuse even the most jaded moviegoer. If you don't like a certain scene, be patient, the director/author will take another whack at it - usually with a subtle visual twist.
This is one film worth watching more than once. In fact, you will want to watch it more than once to see what you missed previously.
This masterwork seriously deserves to be re-released as a DVD.",1036022400,16,1449,5.016597510373444
7802860,5,6300134938,"Somewhat forgotten, to judge by the Amazon reviews and other indicators, this film is nonetheless one of the monuments of the Seventies, which was toward the end of the great phase of cinema. Surprising that it's not better known, having such prominent actors/actrices (e.g. Gielgud, Burstyn and Bogarde (who oddly resembles/mimics Max from ""the Night Porter"")).

This is an extraordinarily literary film, as it might be called. It's about a book, and what is really a philosophical concept. Normally the sound-and-light medium of cinema is wasted on this kind of thing, but, because of the grim fineness of the script and acting, and because of grim visual presence of New England (Providence, a city like absinthe, which is also a character, somewhat like the Mississippi in Huckleberry Finn), we have valid cinema.

Certainly one of the best films not made in Italy, or not made by Bergman. Whether the moral of the story actually holds is something thoughtful people can debate. Thoughtless people, such as the current President of the United States, won't understand the moral or the fable.",1525824000,,1095,5.111731843575419

The restored print premiered at La Biennale-The Venice Film Festival on the 29th of August 2013.  Critics Peter Cowie and Michel Ciment introduced the film which was given a standing ovation by the crowd.  The restored print has a breathtaking, pristine image and sound.

7802867,5,6300134938,"This intellectually intriguing, deeply probing, brilliantly acted film deserves recognition as a classic.  Instead it lies neglected by self-styled film critics, unavailable on DVD (except in PAL format), and known only to the lucky few who saw it in circulation in the '70s.  Why the Criterion Collection, or another restoration house, hasn't reissued ""Providence"" baffles me.  With all the flashy, trashy films on DVD, surely there's room for this Alain Resnais masterpiece, with great performances by Gielgud, Bogarde, Burstyn, Warner, and Stritch!",1306108800,9,551,5.695121951219512
7802868,4,6300134938,"I first caught this movie on a PBS station late 70's or more likely early 80's, and over the years it reemerged in my thoughts even though its title had been forgotten. How delighted I was when a PAL DVD release came my way. The utter confusion and chaotic plot, the biting dialogue and insight into family angst, the dreary symbolism of the aged being dissected, rounded up in a gulag- all this, in the end, the fruits of a sardonic mind in the dying body of true bohemian.

The elder Langham (Gielgud) may not despise his children, may even actually love them in his own way, but clearly the old man's bitterness extends to his two sons. In truth, he resents the ""moral code and values"" by which his son Claude ( the late Dirk Bogarde) has lived his life exemplified by an apparently happy, adultery-free marriage. There's even a hint of jealousy. In his imaginary book, the author attempts to transfer his own moral failings and carnal misadventures unto the blase (in his mind) existence of his children.

Of course how could the elder Langhman have lived otherwise- the life of a brilliant artist; to have lived by a moral code of conduct would be anathema. We both pity him and admire him.

Concerning the DVD: very poor 4:3 letterbox transfer, clearly in need of major clean up and restoration which this movie demands. Yet the surreal cinematography retains its beauty, and of course, the brilliant performances, Gielgud's especially, shine through regardless of the medium.

To watch this movie requires some effort at first viewing, and more rewarding the second time around.",1257638400,,1585,4.773722627737226
7802869,5,6300134938,"John Gielgud stated that his performance in ""Providence"" was the best movie performance of his life. I wouldn't argue with that. A superb cast includes Ellen Burstyn, Dirk Bogarde, and David Warner. The film attempts to show the world through one querulous, dying novelist, and then the world as it really is. Many films have dived into the creative process, but this one succeeds brilliantly. I'm writing Criterion to ask if they could put this on their release schedule. There are so many awful films that have been released on DVD--why this one remains unshown is beyond me.",1255305600,,577,4.8979591836734695
