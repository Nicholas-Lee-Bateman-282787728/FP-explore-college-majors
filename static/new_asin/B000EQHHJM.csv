2529689,2,B000EQHHJM,"Berndt Weikl is a bore.  Siegfried Jerusalem is weak and a poor actor.  MariAnne Haggander is pretty and Hermann Prey has celebrity value, but they don't redeem this tedious performance.

Go for Sir Donald McIntyre and Paul Frey at the Australian Opera.  Or, if you really want to hear MEISTERSINGER as it should be, listen to the Bayreuth 1960 live performance, conducted by Knappertsbusch, with Wolfgang Windgassen and Josef Greindl.",1188691200,10,435,5.171428571428572
2529690,5,B000EQHHJM,"I am lucky that I did not watch this DVD after the MET version.

Many say that Jerusalem is less good as Heppner.  If you believe in the logic that a more massive figure produces better sound in terms of singing, that explains the difference between Heppner's Walther and Jerusalem's.  However, there is a trade-off here - a massive Stolzing is less convincing visually than a tall and elegant figure.

Jersualem did not have the Prize Song done to 100%, that is true. However, it is very near to 100. So the trade-off between the two knights tilts in favour of the Bayreuth version.

The other trade-off is Haggander's committed but less vocally sound Eva with Mattila's uncommitted but vocally marginally stronger Eva.  The two should score a tie here, especially taking into account the Act immediately preceding the Quintet, where Haggander is a more convincing Eva both vocally and visually.

Bernd Wiekl and Hermann Prey are the two stars of this performance. Both are very human, and vocally very adequate, with Prey slightly better than Wiekl, but the two pair up exceedingly well with balanced performance that set off spark after spark in their several encounters.

Then the visual aspect - the costumes and stage-setting are superb.  The religious sense in the libretto is brought out exceedingly well in this production.

It is simply beautiful.",1172448000,17,1357,4.964601769911504
2529691,4,B000EQHHJM,"I am going to restrict my comments to a comparison of this performance with the MET version with Morris, Heppner, etc. because that's a logical and readily available alternative.  I reviewed the MET dvd and also gave it 4 stars (liked the sets and staging except Act 1; Morris somewhat below par; Heppner and Mattila strong but did not ""look"" their parts).  The Bayreuth production in many respects (frustratingly so) complements the MET performance -- strengths of one are shortcomings of the other.  As for sound, the MET orchestra beats the Bayreuth players, Heppner tops Jerusalem, and Mattila tops Haggander. But Weikl tops Morris. The Beckmessers on both recordings are top notch--certainly the best combinations of voice and acting in their respective recordings.

As for staging, the MET's sets and crowd movements are superior in Acts 2 and 3.  The MET has a nice construction of a Nuremberg street for Act 2 (Bayreuth has a more enclosed set); also the MET's Act 3 final scene is handled better (the Bayreuth final scene is positively claustrophobic -- it's as if the director were trying to stuff a telephone booth with college freshmen).  On the other hand, the set for Act 1 at the MET is a disaster (an aisle outside the church nave) whereas Act 1 at Bayreuth takes place in the church nave so the whole congregation is visible during the great chorus after the overture.  The Bayreuth performance has a touching closing in which the director Wolfgang Wagner joins the hands of Sachs and Beckmesser in reconciliation.  But the MET has richer costumes and warmer lighting.

For a dvd performance I'm of the opinion that, when tradeoffs are necessary, the visual impact gets the nod over vocals (within reason of course).  On that basis, I give the Master's wreath to the MET production (but I would substitute Act 1 from Bayreuth).",1169856000,20,1844,4.881410256410256
2529692,5,B000EQHHJM,"This is the best recorded performance of Wagner's Die Meistersinger.

Here's why:

Who is more likely to know Richard Wagner's conception for the opera, than his grandson, Wolfgang Wagner, who is the artistic director of this performance?

Next, imagine assembling some of the very best Wagnerian singers of the past quarter-century:  Bernd Weikl as Sachs, Hermann Prey as Beckmesser, and Siegfried Jerusalem as Walter.  They all sing and act inspiringly!

The staging, scenery, and costumes are perfect:  it's like you're transported back to the Germany of centuries ago.

Richard Wagner was commenting on the rigidity and closedmindedness of the music critics of his day, and the character embodying those critics was Beckmesser, whose role is thus pivotal. Fortunately, this production's Beckmesser (Hermann Prey) is pedantic, sycophantic, officious and tedious--in a word: he's perfect!

The opera makes the point that minds must be kept open to new ideas, while still retaining an understanding of what makes ""classical"" classic.

The Johannestag festival music is some of the brightest and happiest, so much so that those who think Wagner is always heavy and ponderous, will scarcely believe their ears.

Finally, as icing on the cake, when the song contest is over, and the winner crowned, centerstage in the background, you will see Wolfgang Wagner himself, sort of ""patching things up"" between Beckmesser and Sachs--it's a wonderful touch by the artistic director, and I can't help but think that Richard Wagner would approve of his grandson's gesture.",1167091200,15,1561,5.382716049382716
2529693,5,B000EQHHJM,"Wagner is not funny...  Not even here, in his only comedy.  Well, maybe a little funny...  I mean Hans Sachs (Bernd Weikl) teaches Sir Walther Von Stolzing (Siegfried Jerusalem) to be a Mastersinger in one day and Sixtus Beckmesser (Hermann Prey) tries to sing a love song to Eva (Mari Anne Haggander) while Hans Sachs is hammering away on a shoe in loud disruptive rhythms.  Well...  It's funny for Wagner!  The acting and set design are exquisite!  A very real and human staging by Wolfgang Wagner (yes...  related).  The Bayreuther Festspiele is wonderful and artfully sculpted and detailed by Horst Stein without loosing the warm humanity of the music.  I was going to purchase the James Levine MET production with James Morris as Sachs, but I kept seeing this one and decided to give it a try.  I was very happy with my decision.  I enjoyed every second of it... which is impressive concidering there are 16,020 of them!  You may even laugh out loud...  I think I did once or twice.  A great choice that will yield years of enjoyment!",1164672000,23,1039,4.662983425414365
2529694,4,B000EQHHJM,"This 1984 Bayreuth ""Meistersinger"" is good if not completely satisfying. It is, above all, Wagner's grandson and producer Wolfgang Wagner's ""Meistersinger."" Seemingly reacting against the nationalistic tendencies that this opera can bring out, Wolfgang Wagner went the other way, accenting the down-to-earth, folk aspect of the German characters and the German people. There is a simplicity, a naturalism here that has its draws. But something is missing. In Wolfgang Wagner's stretch to make these just everyday people, some of the color, the magnificence of the characters has been lost.

Sachs can be an rather too humdrum here. It is pretty well sung by Bernd Weikl although his range of color is not great. He is best in his poignant individual exchanges with Walther, Eva and Beckmesser. Siegfried Jerusalem's Walther is well sung, often dark toned, albeit a bit stiff in his acting. He is ardent if again a bit on the ordinary side, which however you look at it - is this very natural or somewhat on the boring side - seems to be the modus operendi of Wolfgang Wagner's presentation. The unknown to me Eva, Mari Anne Haggander, is simply ordinary at best with a voice that tends toward the squally in forte. Her launching of the Act 3 quintet does not rise to the occasion.

Herman Prey's Beckmesser is seriously toned down, from a haughty, bumbling snoot to just an ordinary guy who makes some bad decisions. An overdone Beckmesser can damage the proceedings, but an underdone portrayal is no better. What a shame to waste Prey's fine comic acting talents (as in his ""Die Fledermaus"" DVD with Kiri te Kanawa and Solti at Covent Garden). This is especially evident in Act 2 during his exchanges with Sachs, when the latter is really speaking to a hidden Eva. This loses its comic value here, and comes off like weak coffee. A dose of the comic zaniness of Don Knotts would have been helpful for this Beckmesser. There are few chuckles here.

Graham Clark brings more excitement to David than generally is the case with the rest of these singers. Marga Schiml has some charm as Magdalene. Manfred Schenk's Pogner is solid but stolid. The masters are a convincing lot; their common sense attitude  seems right here. The chorus is magnificent. Stein's conducting, as befits such a staging, is a traditional reading, lacking some impetus and detail in the first two act but rising up to the occasion in Act 3.

The sets, as befits this approach, are pleasingly natural if rather plain, especially enticing in the Act 2 Nurnberg street. Ending the fight scene in Act 2 with buckets of water being poured down from a balcony is a nice touch. The glorious Act 3 entry of the tradespeople and mastersingers is too crowded, however.

Brian Large generally has his cameras in the right placed at the right time, but as is his occasional tendency, the Act 2 fight is marred by extreme close-ups, Large's Achilles heel. It's true the scene is held up by Stein's rather pedantic tempos and Large does bring some excitement by this action, but this filming is too much of a shock and is not convincing.

This was filmed over 12 days at Bayreuth and there are no curtain calls, no applause and no sight of an audience, which leads me to believe it was not a live performance.

Overall, there is a charm and a simplicity here that is appealing and grows on you, but a fair amount of the character's zest is missing to give this an unqualified endorsement. I'd had high hopes for this, as it apparently won the Japan Prize years ago.

In rival videos, Levine's Met DVD boasts the glorious singing of Ben Heppner's Walther and Karita Mattila's Eva as its prime recommendations but is seriously dragged down by Levine's lethargic approach and James Morris' pedantic, wobbly Sachs. The best recommendation is Fruhbeck de Burgos' superb, detailed and insightful ""Meistersinger"" from the Deutsches Oper on Arthaus. It has all the excitement, warmth and frisson you could ask for.",1150761600,42,3964,4.817647058823529
2529695,5,B000EQHHJM,"This production has been around on VHS for years, and I've been wearing out the local library's copy, waiting for the DVD. At last it's available, and it has been well worth the wait.

You may be wondering why I consider this to be the best video performance of Meistersinger; after all, there are at least three outstanding productions on DVD.

I'll be honest. One purely personal reason is that it was the first production of Meistersinger I ever saw. They say that the first time for anything is always special....

But putting that aside, let's consider the production on its merits.

Meistersinger is by far Wagner's most light-hearted, humorous, and above all human operas, but it's also his longest. It puts enormous demands on the performers, since in addition to putting Wagnerian demands on their stamina, it also requires them to show the essential humanity of their characters. Everyone in this opera is a human being, with good and bad points, and, importantly, with a depth of character - they can't be played as caricatures. This doesn't always happen.
What makes this production special is that every performer: the singers, the conductor, the orchestra, the musical and television directors, and every member of the chorus works together to produce a coherent and warmly human performance.

This is a Bayreuth production, directed by Wolfgang Wagner, with television direction by Brian Large. As one might expect, the quality is excellent.

Bernd Weikl is a superb Sachs - one might say the definitive Sachs - thoughtful, melancholy, but with a well-developed sense of fun. The director makes an excellent decision in the prelude to act 3, by showing Sachs peacefully reading his book, instead of the traditional Gables of Olde Nurnberg. Very effective.

Hermann Prey plays Beckmesser as a right royal pain - a malicious, self-important bureaucrat with a singular lack of scruples. He's still a human being, though. We still care ( a bit) when he receives his just desserts.

The chemistry between Sachs and Eva (played by MariAnne Haggander)was palpable, and entirely believable. This is vitally important, if we are to care about both characters. Eva herself was well played - just the right combination of coquettishness and compassion.

Siegfied Jerusalem's Walter was perfectly acceptable (although I prefer Heppner's interpretation).

Graham Clark brought great energy and enthusiasm to the part of David, which was very evident during the part when David enumerates a seemingly endless list of musical tones and styles. He managed to differentiate each one; many singers don't bother.

And talking of endless lists, I suspect I've gone on too long.

I'll cut to the chase.

An excellent production, meticulously transcribed to DVD. The sound and picture quality is superb, far surpassing the worn-out VHS tape that I've been used to watching. The Surround-sound conversion is convincing without being obtrusive; ambience rather than audience noise.

If you love Meistersinger, you must have this performance.

Oh yes, I almost forgot. Look for a cameo appearance of  Wolfgang Wagner in the closing seconds of the opera, joining the hands of Sachs and Beckmesser.

And now, if you will excuse me, I think I'll watch it again...",1146787200,85,3250,5.14828897338403
8113277,5,B000EQHHJM,Bought this as a replacement for the copy I had on laser disc. Hermann Prey is sensational. He gives a sympathetic feel to the Beckmesser. Bernd Weikl & Siegfried Jerusalem also great. Love this performance.,1511136000,,207,4.942857142857143
8113278,4,B000EQHHJM,This a good performance of this opera by Richard Wagner so now up dating to DVD from VHS. The lead was Bernd Weikl not Richard Wagner. This needs to be corrected in the actor section of this record.,1437091200,,198,4.2368421052631575

8113280,5,B000EQHHJM,"This is one of the two best Meistersingers on DVD, the other being the classic Otto Schenck staging at the Metropolitan Opera.  While I slightly prefer the Met production visually, this one wins vocally, with strong casting all around but a special treat in the Beckmesser of Hermann Prey, one of his very few opera roles to be preserved complete on film (though Thomas Allen at the Met is quite good also).  In the two major male roles, I prefer Weikl and Jerusalem to their Met counterparts of Morris and Heppner, which is decisive for me. As for the rest, the Met is perhaps slightly stronger overall for singers.  Haeggander is here more girlish than Mattila, but the latter has the better voice.  Graham Clark is a fine David, though Polenzani for the Met is even better; ditto for Manfred Schenk vs. Rene Pape as Pogner.  I do prefer Horst Stein's brisker conducting to that of the more indulgent Levine, and also Schiml over the Met's Jill Grove as Magdalena.",1428019200,4,966,4.658823529411765
8113281,4,B000EQHHJM,"I think it was a very well-produced.  However, one famous criticism of Wagnerian music is that
it is moments of absolute beauty surrounded by quarter hours of absolute boredom, or words
to that effect.  One gripe that I have is that this is a production geared toward showing that
the sets show scenery that one must guess at rather than see.  (That thing sticking up...
is it a tree, a telephone pole, or a phallus, that sort of thing)",1427414400,,436,4.493670886075949
8113282,5,B000EQHHJM,"This 1984 Bayreuth production is probably one of the best on video and ideal for home viewing.  It is a live performance given without an audience.  The only slightly noticeable 'retake' is the famous quintet.  One could quibble about whether this character or that character is more characterful or sung better or worse in another production but the singers in this performance are all very fine and none of them have voices that strike a sour note.  Apart from a rather young looking (and handsome) Hans Sachs, they all present a pleasing and appropriate visual picture.  The settings are a lovely cleaned up version of Nuremberg in medieval times.  The conductor, Horst Stein, does a fine job of handling the massive four and a half hour score.  If this work is to your liking, prepare to sit back and luxuriate in the visual and aural beauty as it unfolds.",1381363200,,860,4.731543624161074
8113283,5,B000EQHHJM,"This production of die Meistersinger is superior to the MET version. The main reason is that Han Sachs is an important character in the opera. The MET production with Morris diminishes the production. His voice is too heavy and lethargic for the part. I liked both the Bayreuth production and the MET, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be Bayreuth. The character of Eva and Pogner are also cast better in the Bayreuth production. Sixtus Beckmesser is strong in both productions.",1371168000,4,486,4.729411764705882
8113284,5,B000EQHHJM,"Great cast and wonderfully performed. The biggest issue is that there could potentially be more tracks for each individual scene, instead of 3 big tracks for each act.

8113285,4,B000EQHHJM,My only reservation is Jerusalem's wooden performance.  He needs some coaching on his acting to round out his other talents.,1359936000,,124,5.2
8113286,5,B000EQHHJM,"H.L. Mencken called this the greatest artistic achievement ever - and you'll find out why when you see & hear this outstanding performance.

I saw the Met's in person & I don't think it beat this one.  I agree with the commentator who found Levine's conducting a bit draggy.  And I say that in worship of Jimmy and all he's done to keep opera in New York respectable when most everyone else has succumbed to the banalities and absurdities of ""producer opera"".

I will have to get the Met set sooner or later I guess.  It's unfortunately not available on Netflix as of this moment.  Since for some reason Meistersinger is one of only two Wagner operas (no, not counting Rienzi) I don't have on dvd I want to avoid buying duplicates when one version is clearly more to my liking than the other.  I have a strong feeling this one will win.

The sound BTW is not spectacular.  I was hoping for better, but this is a 1984 production with attendant technical limitations.  Not that it's inadequate - but one gets so spoiled nowadays with the fabulous sound coming from DDD recordings.

P.S. Amazon advertises this as ""starring Richard Wagner"".  Needless to say I was disappointed - but his grandson did his best to atone  ...",1317600000,2,1219,4.56221198156682
