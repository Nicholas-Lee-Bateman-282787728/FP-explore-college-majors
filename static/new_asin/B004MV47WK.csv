4432791,1,B004MV47WK,"(5/4/12) One star for this DVD because of the lack of subtitles/closed captions. It's incomprehensible to me why a studio would do this, unless it's a misguided and callous attempt to economize. There must be millions of movie fans who want subtitles/captions for different reasons, so I'm not sure how the studios think they are economizing by ignoring the wishes of a large segment of the market. I like to watch movies at low volume with the English subtitles turned on so I don't have to strain to catch all the dialog, while my wife is a non-native English speaker who needs subtitles. Certainly there are many cinephiles with less than perfect hearing. So it would seem to be counterproductive for studios to release DVDs like this one.",1336089600,,742,4.8046875
4432792,2,B004MV47WK,"Sadly for me, The Duel is a film which looks good on the screen, but unfortunately is a badly directed adaptation of Anton Chekov's fine novella of the same name.  The director, Dover Koshashvili, portrays Laevsky, the central character in the novella, as a nasty, brutish lout whose bizarre behavior is as unaccountable to the other characters in the film as it is to the viewer. He has left St. Petersburg for a small town on the Black Sea with another man's wife.  He discovers that he does not love this woman, Nadya, and wants to leave her and return to St. Petersburg.  He tries to borrow money from a local doctor, who in turn asks a zoologist, Van Koren, for the rubles.  Van Koren hates Laevsky and tries to persuade the doctor to convince Laevsky to take Nadya with him when he leaves.  When Laevsky comes to ask for the money, he insults the doctor and Van Koren uses this provocation to challenge Laevsky to fight a duel.  Those that wish to see this film can discover the outcome of the duel for themselves.

As noted, director Koshashvili's mishandling and misunderstanding of the main character make it difficult for the viewer to make much sense of the story.  All the other characters in the film have the same problem as the viewer; they watch Laevsky's antics with some astonishment, not knowing what to make of his behavior, and yet they tolerate him.  Almost as confusing and equally unsatisfying is the treatment of Nadya, the woman who has left her husband for Laevsky.  The director has little understanding of what motivates her as she interacts with Laevsky and the other characters in the film. In Chekov's novella, Nadya plays a small, but important role.  In Koshasvili's film she is a central character and has many scenes unnecessary to the development of the story.

After viewing the movie I went back to Chekov's novella to determine if there was some confusion in his telling of his story and his treatment of his characters.  The story, translated by the reliable Constance Garnett, is crystal clear and beautifully told.  Laevsky and Nadya are complicated human beings.  Chekov is so skillful and great a writer that we slowly begin to understand these truly unhappy and pitiful people.  I recommend the novella, not the film.",1327622400,11,2263,4.764102564102564
4432793,1,B004MV47WK,"One of the single most badly directed, badly scripted (in the parts that are not actual text of Chekhov's), badly adapted, badly conceived, badly interpreted, and badly acted films from a short novel I have ever seen. This film is sappy where Chekhov is incisive, melodramatic where Chekhov is subtle. Its as if not one of the actors has actually bothered to read the short novel and miss the entire point of it and its tone. Please don't waste your 1.99, but spend the money and read the story. Sad, very sad. Like a made for T.V. version replete with jingly tone deaf music.",1409270400,,576,4.548076923076923
4432794,5,B004MV47WK,"""The Duel"" is one of the most complex and interesting short stories in Western literature: it takes on class, ethnicity, sexuality, Darwinism, Christianity, and subtle interpersonal topics like ""generosity"" and ""self-interest"" in the quietest and most subtle way. I read the story every year: second- best is seeing this film, which gets everything right and even adds just the right visuals to make its point. The acting, direction, and costumes are impeccable -- you will think yourself in late 19th-century Russia for days afterward. My only reservation is with the last 3 minutes, which obscure Chekhov's conclusions. See it now.",1388448000,7,633,5.34
4432795,5,B004MV47WK,"Great acting and direction, wonderful script, beautiful cinematography.
It's basically about two men, one of whom you admire and the other of whom
you dislike intensely. But could they change positions over time? There's
a lot of action, despite the source material; ""Chekhov"" so often signifies
something like ""Nothing happens,"" but not here. And despite the English accents,
the film has a Russian feeling, perhaps because the director is from Georgia
(the Eastern European one, not the American). And Fiona Glascott has to be one
of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in a movie. A very rich experience.",1379808000,2,611,5.12
4432796,5,B004MV47WK,"Chekhov's marvelous novella, ""The Duel,"" is a compelling story about the foibles
of men and women who love too much or not enough. The only generous character,
the doctor, tries to offer help to the despairing and anxiety-ridden anti-hero, but the latter's
self-absorption is so intense that not even a doctor can keep the lover from entrapping
himself at every turn. The duel in the end is the epitome of arrogance, the natural
outcome of a life of decadence, and a clever symbol of the lover's inability to free
himself from the duel with his own demons.",1377907200,,556,4.742268041237113
4432797,5,B004MV47WK,"It seemed well cast and the environment was very scenic.  This is supposed to be one of Chekhov's better short stories.  I haven't read it yet to see how well the movie adheres to the story.  When a movie is available, I like to watch it first to better visualize the characters.",1377388800,,279,4.326923076923077
4432798,5,B004MV47WK,"""Anton Chekhov's The Duel"" is an excellent well acted film with fabulous scenery and period dress.  It offers a great snapshot of late 19th century Russian society outside of Moscow.  Furthermore, it is a good rendition of the major elements of Chekhov's excellent story.  There is even a scene with a lady with a little dog in reference to another classic Chekhov story.  Musically it is also excellent and this part of the film really helps to carry the story along.  The movie in fact has only one real major flaw and that would be two brief scenes of nudity that are not important to the story at all.  Chekhov, among other things, is the master of the unstated and the subtle.  Despite the undercurrent of sexuality in the story, it never is directly described or referenced.  Though present, it is oblique and this should have been retained.  This factor also makes it harder for this excellent film to be used in an educational setting where it really could help illustrate the story.  The DVD could have been so ordered as to include both the original and an edited version so that it could more easily be used in the classroom.  Perhaps a future release could include that as it would not be very hard to do and would shave less than a minute off the story.  I highly recommend this film, though one should definitely read the story first.  The book is always better, no matter how good the film ends up being.",1357344000,,1419,4.539370078740157
4432799,5,B004MV47WK,"Chekhov's  THE DUEL, an astounding novella that will change your mind about what a short work of fiction can do, has been faithfully, thoughtfully, affectionately, and intelligently transformed into a movie that has all the wild energy and deep psychological pathos of the original work.  Don't miss it.  Everything about it is wonderful, the actors, the direction, the setting  (shot in Croatia which is stunningly beautiful), and the script.  Can't recommend highly enough.",1348790400,,475,5.4520547945205475
4432800,5,B004MV47WK,"Thumbs up. If you're an Andrew Scott fan, you'll like this one. (It's so beyond Scott's other roles and he shows himself as a versatile, quality actor in this one. I'm not familiar with Chekhov at all but doesn't matter here.  None of the story is obscure as you'd expect from a classic writer. The story was done more like a stage play but most frequently outdoors. More like a series of vignettes with the same characters. The cast did a good job to go with Scott's exceptional acting. The scenery in The Duel was worth watching if just for the sea scenes. I wanted so much to NE there. The costumes were not overwhelmingly period. I am SO glad they used their own British accents instead of trying to do Russian accents. It's worth watching more than once. (Now that Scott's won the BAFTA award, I'm hoping to see him in more movies!)",1340841600,4,837,4.435064935064935
4432801,5,B004MV47WK,"It is a wonderful interpretation of the famous Chekhov's novel with a new approach and deep examination of the novel's main characters.  The direction of the film and the photography are second to none.  Considering none of the actors were of Russian background their ability to study and recreate that ""Russian"" soul is really commendable.  It felt authentic Russian through and through.  It was a real treat.  My mother-in-law, an old English lady fell in love with the film.  I felt so proud!  Definitely recommend buying it and keep on your library shelf for returning back to it again and again and then passing on to your kids.  It is worth it.",1339459200,2,650,4.741071428571429
4432802,5,B004MV47WK,"Any adaptation from a much-loved work of literature is bound to disappoint, or puzzle, on certain levels. Some succeed and some fail miserably. This ""interpretation"" of Chekhov's novella is faithful, esthetic, respectful - perhaps almost too respectful to work as a film on its own, if the viewer has no prior knowledge of Chekhov's often strange and certainly vanished world. I do think this is a successful interpretation of Chekhov's intent, however; it is well-written, well-acted, and immaculately produced, with gorgeous scenery and music, and it renders well the atmosphere of the original. Not a film for anyone expecting ""action"" from the duel of the title, but certainly rewarding for those who are still looking for a visual poetry from the cinema, or a questioning of the human heart.",1337904000,5,796,5.178294573643411
8436243,2,B004MV47WK,"Ultra confusing!! Neither I, a lover of Russian literature, nor a non-committal friend, could understand the relationships among the characters and/or what was going on. Albeit, I'm a late-comer to Chekhov, especially his short-stories and novellas, but this cinematic adaptation offered no incentive to pursue an interest in this highly regarded writer! Lacking background information, historical, social, or otherwise, nor any sympathetic characterizations, plus ultra poor audio-realization of dialogue, this DVD.did a terrible disservice in making the case for a major Russian writer. How sad!!!",1512172800,,599,6.0588235294117645

It is sensitively directed with an eye for detail and has convincing performances by Andrew Scott and Fiona Glascott with a fine supporting cast.  It has an intelligent script and is worth owning for the cinematography  beautifully shot in Croatia with lush exteriors and interesting interiors.  People say that Croatia has the look and feel of Eastern Europe before the world wars and its lovely haunting soundtrack is fitting as well.  I resisted buying it for a few years after seeing it online and then felt that I just had to own it in my library so that I could watch it again and again.  If you like Chekhov, you would probably like it.  It has been a very satisfying purchase for me.",1441238400,,766,4.6716417910447765
