8236657,5,B001033BFM,"Very informative and comprehensive review on the topic of sexual intimacy for the baby boomers. A group of men and women in their 60s-70s discuss their problems and concerns about relationships, sexuality, physical limitations, and psychological inhibitions. Dr. Sugrue answers their questions and provides good education. I've learned a lot from this video.
The DVD can be watched in segments. It has nice graphics and is well directed. I would highly recommend it to all boomers who are still interested in sex.",1197936000,,513,5.2682926829268295
