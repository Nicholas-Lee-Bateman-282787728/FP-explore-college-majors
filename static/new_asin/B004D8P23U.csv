4331576,2,B004D8P23U,"When I first heard these films would hit Blu-Ray, I was pretty excited since these Di Leo films are among his best and are some of my all time favorites. It was going to be great to see these films in definitive home video editions! Sadly, these new transfers don't look very good at all. They are swimming with digital noise and artifacts that may have been film grain at one point but is now a mass of swirling fuzz. The further away from the TV you get, the better the image appears to look.

The major letdown of the set, however, are the weird, split-second video glitches on the Blu-Ray disc of The Italian Connection (that can be seen in this photo I took here [...] ). Another similar glitch can be seen during the lumberyard fight, and then at least 5 more instances are seen during the final junkyard scene. I'm pretty sure this isn't an isolated incident, so if you've encountered these video glitches throughout the disc, please let Raro know that they need to correct this. They seem to not be willing to fix this problem at the moment and replied with this message to me:

""Thanks for pointing out the problem with the Italian Connection blu-ray. Unfortunately, at this point there's not much we can do to correct the disc. If you're dissatisfied with the collection you can return it and we'll issue you a refund. Alternatively we can send you the single DVD of the Italian Connection, so that you have a clean copy. Again, thank you for your feedback and ongoing interest in RaroVideo.""

I'll most likely be returning my Blu-Ray set for a refund and sticking with the original Italian Raro DVDs that still look surprisingly great upconverted on my HDTV. It's a bummer. I want to support Raro because they are consistently releasing interesting and desirable Italian films that are English friendly. But, with their track record of quality already down the tubes, it's hard to recommend blind buying anything they release (Before this, they had issues with their DVD versions of The Boss and Dorian Grey). My fingers are crossed that they can overcome this and drastically improve their quality control.

4331577,4,B004D8P23U,"I came upon this set after reading a positive review of CALIBER 9. I decided to take a chance and check out 4 by this acclaimed yet unknown-to-me director.

Each film looks and sounds great, especially in the original language/dialects.

CALIBER 9 was my favorite for plot and acting. The twists and turns of the plot worked quite well, and the climactic revelation is so well-filmed it's astounding. AWESOME stuff. VERY SERIOUS. And Barbara Bouchet is a serious eye-full throughout. Impressive action drama, not just puffed-up swaggering macho nonsense.

THE BOSS was my favorite, though, for outrageous, cold, trashy, guilty-pleasure CARNAGE. Henry Silva taking out a bunch of (spoiler) in a (spoiler) with a (spoiler) has to be one of my new favorite action sequences. And he does it silently. None of the stupid cliche's we've been subjected to in contemporary films, like screaming, two-gun-toting, anguished killers. This is his job and he gets it done and in doing so he left my jaw dropped open to the floor. Lots of dark humor in this one. Never thought I'd laugh with some of the things I did while enjoying this one.

RULERS OF THE CITY has some well-choreographed nastiness throughout, and Jack Palance owns the screen every time he enters it. I liked the contrast of the younger, capricious, less commanding, less serious male lead in this compared to the other 3 films.

THE ITALIAN CONNECTION was, in my opinion, rather ho-hum, dated and way too serious, but, it had its moments, too. I just found the acting of the leads in that one to have nowhere near the charisma seen in the other 3 films. (yes, eve though Henry Silva is in THE BOSS as well.) And it is melodramatic to the nth degree.

I'd recommend this set to anyone who loves oversaturated celluloid, gorgeous 60's Italian design, go-go dancers occupying the full ratio of the screen, and some dead-serious vengeance.",1327968000,3,1891,4.857142857142857

No computer generated images of heroes flipping and swinging from high rises here. Down and dirty action and violence on the gut level only. Real action at real time! BEAUTIFUL!

4331579,4,B004D8P23U,"[FERNANDO DI LEO - THE ITALIAN CRIME COLLECTION - (1973-74-76) -Widescreen presentation]  Excellent collection of four grindhouse-era crime flicks that are impeccably digitally restored and remastered, housed in a nice box loaded with bonus features along with a great booklet with photos, a bookmark and a lengthy interview with Fernando Di Leo. The slim cased dvd's feature original poster art as covers and the films themselves are in Italian with English subs instead of the cheesy, cartoonish dubbing that's prevalent in many similar-era crime dramas. This makes for a much more entertaining and accurate viewing experience. A first-class treatment all the way and one I'd heartily recommend. (And I didn't have any of the issues other reviewers have stated).

Of the four films, 'Caliber 9' and 'The Italian Connection' are the best of the lot, though all four are solid examples of social, criminal and political extremism and corruption as exemplified by a true master of the genre. At times insanely garish, ultra-violent, intricately plotted and peppered by petty gangsters, whores and pimps with allegiance to no one, this set is a bargain to aficionados of all types of crime dramas and grindhouse flicks. Steal yours now.",1315353600,,1234,5.258883248730965
4331580,5,B004D8P23U,"Wow. This set is wonderful. I love Italian movies, especially Italian CRIME movies and this one does not disappoint. Fernandao Di Leo knows how to film action (gunplay) scenes. It's better than most modern movies.

First up is CALIBER 9. It's about a guy who gets of prison and everyone wants to know where the money is. What money? Well, our guy Ugo says he doesn't know. No one believes him. Ugo doesn't care. He's a tough, quiet guy who is similar to Jason Statham. I won't ruin it for you but the end is pretty great.

Next is THE ITALIAN CONNECTION, about a small time pimp who gets in over his head and ends up getting a price on it. Then they hurt him in a way they should never had and well....it's revenge time. I liked this a bit better than CALIBER 9. What's unique is that there is a team of two hitman, one black and one white (Henry Silva and Woody Strode) and you can't help but realize that's where Tarantino got the idea for the hitmen team in Pulp Fiction. Great stuff.

Up third is THE BOSS with Henry Silva again. He plays a cold-blooded killer. Some of the parts are excellent but as a whole I'm not sure it's as good as THE ITALIAN CONNECTION.

Last is RULERS OF THE CITY (aka MR. SCARFACE which you can find on butchered public domain copies). Jack Palance is somewhat out of place as a crime boss in Italy. What separates this film from the others is that parts of it is quite funny. Our two ""heroes"" are somewhat bumbling. The last fifteen minutes or so is pure action with cars and motorcycle chases, shoot-outs, etc. Overall, pretty satisfying.

As a whole, this set is close to perfect. Di Leo is an excellent director and these films are entertaining as hell.

4331581,4,B004D8P23U,"Nothing to add in the way of another film review.
The treatment of these movies is good, they look and sound very nice.
Yes, the cases are a bit flimsy but they're acceptable.
I, too, had an issue with the Il Boss disc. The feature doesn't freeze up but the Storie di Mafia documentary does have the 30 second audio delay. It's pretty f'n annoying and might render it unwatchable for many. I'm pretty patient with such things and still had a difficult time.
The ""anyone can get a lemon"" assessment by an earlier reviewer doesn't apply here.
The now-majority of Amazon buyers are having these same problems.
What seems odd to me is that the quality warnings on here are getting ""1 out of 5 found this helpful"" responses.
Seems to me that it might be kind of important to a potential buyer.

For whatever it's worth I'll contact RaroVideo.
Still, I won't be returning the set.
The films are great and I'm happy to have spent $20 to have them collected.

4331584,5,B004D8P23U,"After watching way too many poor transfers of Euro films from the seventies, it's a real treat when I get a chance to see them released by a studio that actually cares what the final product looks like.  In my opinion, Raro Video did an outstanding job with these four films, from the production value of the transfers to the package as a whole.  I'm not going to imply that each one of these films is a five-star effort - even though fans of this director and this genre will most likely rate them very high, while others may nitpick at them - rather that it is the collection itself that I'm rating as top of the line, one that any enthusiast of Eurocrime or seventies cinema will find it well worth their time to track down.

Were I to rate them separately, I would give each film four stars - they all have their plusses and minuses, which seem inextricably linked in each.  The first three films - Caliber 9, The Italian Connection, and The Boss - are part of Di Leo's 'Milieu Trilogy', a loosely linked series that doesn't follow a continuous storyline, but rather examines the criminal landscape of Italy in the early 1970's.  Taking inspiration from the stories of Russian-born &eacute;migr&eacute; Giorgio Scerbanenco, 'Caliber 9' (Milano Calibro 9) may very well be the overall best of the three, with Gastone Moschin taking up the part of the just-released convict Ugo Piazza, whom the berserk Mario Adorf suspects of having stolen money from his organization prior to the start of his three year-prison sentence.  Labeled as noir by some, with a plot twisting and turning as well as anything by Chandler or Hammett, this film has one remarkable ending.

Mario Adorf returns in 'The Italian Connection' (La Mala Ordina) as a small-time pimp and hustler Luca Canali who gets served up as a fall-guy for two American hit men (Woody Strode and Henry Silva), who are sent to Milan to make an example of the man who stole a shipment of heroin.  On the run, with nothing to lose, its either fight back against the overwhelming odds or die.  This one is also based on a Scerbanenca story, and though I don't think it's quite on the same level as 'Caliber 9', it is still an extremely entertaining film.  Henry Silva is back again in the trilogy's final installment, 'The Boss' (Il Boss), as bit-player Nick Lanzetta, and the film tracks his violent climb to the top of the organization.  Somewhat talky, which slows down the film in spots, Silva still shines as an ice-cold killer.

The last film, supposedly exclusive to this box set, is 'Rulers of the City' (I Padroni della Citt&agrave;) with Jack Palance, Al Cliver and Harry Baer.  This film seems somewhat mislabeled as a comedy - it is a bit more light-hearted than the others, but that's about it.  Baer (looking like nothing so much as the younger brother of Robert Downey Jr.) and Cliver, a couple of nobodies trying to get ahead in the world, scam Palance's organization out of 10 million Lira.  Getting the money was easy - getting away with it is the hard part.

All four films are highly entertaining, though time and distance mutes some of the social commentary that di Leo peppered his films with.  All but 'The Italian Connection' include a soundtrack by Luis Bacalov, which reminds me (especially in 'Caliber 9') of the outstandingly funky pinball theme from Sesame Street.  I watched all the films in Italian, but they all come with both English and Italian options.  From my understanding, all Italian films from this time were re-dubbed after filming, even for Italian audiences, and 'Caliber 9' has probably the worst dubbing of the four films, though I consider this somewhat to be expected with these films and don't subtract much because of it.  The 'Milieu Trilogy' films are all in 16x9 anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1; 'Rulers of the City' is non-anamorphic wide-screen (black bars on top, bottom and sides).  Above all, these films look terrific.  Restored and remastered, they pop off the screen.  Extras include five documentaries spread out over the four discs, consisting of interviews with Di Leo, his actors and crew, and historians to address different subjects relating to each film.  Also included in the box set is a small booklet containing excerpts of the Di Leo interview.

While its understandable that anyone can get a lemon, I thought the packaging in this collection was fine - each film comes in its own case, and which are exactly the same as regular DVD packaging except that they are half as thick.  The DVD itself is affixed to a spindle to keep it in place (as it is in traditional cases), and unlike some cheap sets, the tension on the spindle is sufficient to keep the DVD from slipping off and banging around loose inside the case.  All my DVD's arrived in good shape and played well, and I highly recommend the entire set.",1303516800,34,4853,4.705673758865248

4331587,5,B004D8P23U,These films look better than they ever have before on disc. However they are not going to look as good as what you see on modern movies. The fact that they used original negatives to master these helps a lot though. They could have slogged these out like some films are with some old worn prints. If you haven't seen movies from Fernando Di Leo then you haven't seen great crime movies. All of these are from ITALY in the 1970's a very violent period in that countries history.  The movies reflect that and these are movies with great deep plots and characters that ring true to life. I had most of these on standard dvd that were imports from raro video. Now thankfully they put them out on blu ray in our region. And that rocks. the price is great too! Four movies on blu ray for a decent price. THis is worth owning.,1366848000,,819,4.283870967741936

4331592,5,B004D8P23U,"Are you kidding me?!?!
The quality of the first 3 films is through the roof.
Calibre 9 and Italian connection are completely different in terms of theme and rendering, both are masterfully crafted but its impossible to pick a favorite. I will lean a bit towards Italian connection mainly because of the main character Luca and how he operates, tho I must tip my hat to ugo from calibre 9.
I won't spill the beans on these, you'll want to go in blind and without looking at the included booklet or any of the extras.
I will say that both films start slowly and build to incredibly cathartic resolutions.
By this I mean, they will blow you out of your seat and you'll be writhing about the floor in astonishment and ecstasy.
Interestingly enough, as a film the Boss seems ""aware"".
Possibly, the Boss hearing how much you enjoyed the earlier films, is engaging in your discussion of them?
If so, the Bosses initial sequence could be seen as a cinematic rebuff of your exuberance over Calibre 9 and the Italian connection.",1342483200,2,1018,4.5989010989010985
4331593,1,B004D8P23U,All 4 of the discs in this set wouldn't play at all.  Couldn't get to a menu screen or anything.  The blu-ray player tried to read them and just ejected them after about 30 seconds.,1333065600,4,181,4.142857142857143
4331594,4,B004D8P23U,"In the past year or so I've really gotten into Italian cult cinema, mainly Giallo, but I've also become a growing fan of actresses such as Barbara Bouchet and Marisa Mell.  When I learned a Bouchet film was going to be released on Blu-ray in this four film series I jumped on it, especially at the price point of $23.99 (what I pre-ordered it at).  Having seen none of these films before and still being rather new to the Euro-Crime genre I didn't know what to expect.  Having watched them all I'm glad I took the plunge.

Transfer wise there's no complaints from me, then again I'm not overly picky about picture and sound like some people are.  I've watched and enjoyed enough bad VHS rips that for me it's more about the entertainment value than the quality, quality is just a bonus.  But here the quality appears to be top notch to me, definitely better than I'm sure these films have ever looked before.

Film wise my personal favorite out of the four was The Italian Connection, for me it had the best combination of non stop action and story, Mario Adorf is simply awesome, never a dull moment.  The other three films are also entertaining in their own rights, although I was a little disappointed in Caliber 9, Bouchet's role was pretty minimal and as one of the more hyped films in the collection I actually found it a little boring at times, Mario Adorf and the limited amount of Bouchet carried that one for me.

Anyone whose a fan of these films or this genre should be more than happy with this set.  The current price of $24.99 is simply a steal for these four films on Blu-ray.

3.5 stars for average entertainment value of the films.

8424927,2,B004D8P23U,"Quentin Tarantino has credited Fernando di Leo with inspiring his work in the gangster genre. If so, it's a clear case of the student surpassing the teacher. The four films in this collection are breathtakingly routine, often worse. Least of them is ""Rulers of the City"" (""I Padroni della Citta"" aka ""Mr. Scarface"") a Mafia 'comedy' that is as stultifyingly dull as it is unfunny. Di Leo anchored each of these films with at least one faded Hollywood star. Here it is Jack Palance's bad luck to be on the butt end of jokes. ""Rulers ..."" wasn't even deemed worthy of a 16:9 remastering, unlike the other films in the box. Smoother but scarcely worthy of note is ""The Boss,"" in which Henry Silva shoots his way to the top of a Mob family run by Richard Conte, another Tinseltown legend fallen on hard times.

Not even the presence of lovely, muscle-toned Barbara Bouchet can elevate ""Milano Calibro 9,"" in which Gastone Moschin gets a hard time from ""the Americano"" (Lionel Stander) after taking a rap for the boss man. Di Leo cites this, in an accompanying interview, as his best film. If so, I would hate to see his worst. Except for an ability to handle scenes in lengthy, unobtrusive master shots there is nothing about Di Leo's aesthetic (to use the term loosely) to mark him as noteworthy. And, for a crime-movie director, he is remarkably inefficient at laying out action scenes.

Only ""The Italian Connection"" (""La Mala Ordina"") holds one's attention firmly, probably due to the Everyman appeal of Mario Adorf as a small-time pimp trying to outwit The Man (Cyril Cusak). Silva and Woody Strode turn up as salt-and-pepper hitmen likely to have you thinking of ""Pulp Fiction,"" with the difference being that Tarantino would have given them something interesting to do other than just glower a lot.

At least Raro Video has given Di Leo better treatment than he deserves. Each film comes with at least one ""making of"" featurette -- although one was badly out of sync. There's also a lavish booklet and a Di Leo bookmarked -- perhaps to tell you that you should be reading rather than watching this ... well, I was going to say ""dreck"" but it's too dull to even merit that epithet.",1496275200,,2183,4.6796875

There was a serious glitch in ""The Italian Connection"" which made it impossible to watch the end of the movie. My DVD player froze when it got to that scene and my computer showed a lot of digital rot at the same place.

8424934,5,B004D8P23U,"My first experience with Fernando di Leo's films was on Video Asia's Thug City Chronicles: Volume 1 collection, which contained decent transfers of ""Milan Caliber 9,"" ""The Italian Connection,"" and ""The Boss.""  The drawback about the Video Asia set was the presentation, which had panned-and-scanned letterbox versions of each film to fit a 4:3 frame.  When I looked up the movies from the Thug City set on Amazon and found this Blu-Ray box set, I was thrilled, and even more so when I found that it was on sale for almost 50% off.  I snatched up a copy and have recently completed watching the set on Blu-Ray, and thought it deserved a review.

I started with the first and arguably the best film, ""Milan Caliber 9,"" which is simply labeled ""Caliber 9"" by Raro Video.  This movie was Fernando di Leo's first entry into the euro-crime genre and the first part of the loosely-connected Milieu trilogy.  Gastone Moschin plays Ugo Piazza, a hood who just spent three years in prison after getting nailed for robbery.  Unfortunately, Ugo's old mafia buddies (which includes Italian mainstay Mario Adorf as the vicious Rocco and Lionel Stander, the voice of Kup from Transformers: The Movie, as Rocco's boss) believe that he has $300,000 of Stander's money hidden somewhere.  The cops, who are really no better than the crooks, want Ugo to snitch on Stander and send him and his associates up the river.  Even the beautiful Barbara Bouchet, who plays Ugo's girlfriend, believes he has the money.  When push comes to shove, Ugo starts manipulating Stander, Adorf, Bouchet, and the cops like a chess master, making all of them run around like a Chinese fire drill.  But boy, he didn't see that double-cross coming, and neither will you.

The second film in the Milieu trilogy is ""The Italian Connection,"" which has been available for years in the public domain as ""Manhunt.""  Henry Silva and Woody Strode headline this tale of two American hitmen sent to Milan to eliminate a small-time pimp named Luca Canoli (played to the hilt by Mario Adorf).  They're told that he ripped off a New York cocaine shipment, but that couldn't be further from the truth, and the more Luca tries to figure out why he's been fingered in this mess, the more people his boss, the detestable Don Vito, sends to kill Luca.  Even Luca's ex-wife and daughter aren't safe from Don Vito's wrath, and while Silva and Strode live it up nightly in the clubs, trying to find Luca, Luca is slumming it out with a hippie girl he knows, trying to find some place to hide and some place to figure out why his life is going to hell.  When the truth comes out and the final confrontation between Silva, Strode, and Adorf is set to take place, you will be in for a real treat.

The third and final film in the Milieu trilogy is ""The Boss,"" which is my absolute favorite.  Henry Silva returns as the lead star in this film, but loses the useless appendage that Woody Storde was in ""The Italian Connection.""  Silva plays a bad-ass mob hitman named Frank Lanzetta, who opens the film by blowing up a group of men watching a skin flick in a screening room.  He does this via a 1970's-style grenade launcher, and as he escapes uses his last grenade on one of the filmgoer's henchmen, tearing him to shreds.  The screening room hit was ordered by Don Corasco (played with expert reserve by Richard Conte), a man who heads up the Sicilian mob.  Unfortunately, Lanzetta got all but one of the skin freak's men--Coukky, a crazed and wild mobster who refuses to make peace with Don Corasco and kidnaps Lanzetta's boss's daughter in broad daylight.  Lanzetta is sent in to rescue her, but having been given orders from Corasco, he makes sure his boss and his assistant won't cause Corasco any more trouble, and soon makes his way up the mob food chain, double-crossing everyone in his path and laying waste to Coukky and his men.

The fourth film included in this set is ""Rulers of the City,"" which has been widely available in the public domain as ""Mister Scarface.""  Jack Palance plays Mister Scarface, a mob boss who smokes cigarettes in an old-fashioned holder and has a reputation of shooting first and asking questions later.  Tony, a debt collector for a small-time mob dude named Luigi, dreams of making it big someday and going to live with his brother in Brazil (which is made pretty clear by Tony wearing a shirt that says ""Brazil"" for the first half of the movie).  When Rick, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed pretty boy who works for Scarface loses some of Scarface's money while playing poker at Luigi's place, Scarface comes in to make the deal right, and roughs Rick up to teach him a lesson.  Tony takes pity on Rick and takes the puny thug to his place, where they concoct a plot to rip off Scarface for ten million dollars.  Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and when Luigi gets word that Scarface is looking for Tony because of the rip-off, people get double-crossed, peopled get killed, and people get avenged.

Each film is presented in 16x9 widescreen with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio (despite what the box says about ""Rulers of the City"" being in 4:3).  They filled the entire screen on my 32"" widescreen TV, something I very much appreciated.  I watched all four films dubbed in English, which I think adds to the kitsch factor of it all, and found that the English dub's volume would only increase to a certain point and then wouldn't get any louder, regardless of how far you turned it up.  Whether this was simply due to my television or something on Raro Video's part, I have no clue, but I would have liked it if the English audio were a little louder so I could pick up what Gastone Mochin's actor was mumbling in some  of those scenes of ""Milan Caliber 9.""

As for the image quality, these movies look great.  Compared to that Video Asia release I had, this is like a blessing from Heaven, if Heaven showed Fernando di Leo movies, or any movies at all (I guess we'll know when we get there, huh?).  As for the video glitches experienced by some viewers in ""Rulers of the City,"" I had no such issues on my Samsung ST-66 Blu-Ray player.  There are certain moments in all four films, however, where it looks like the film went off the reel during the transfer.  This is clearly evident in ""The Italian Connection,"" where the image runs almost totally off-screen for a good three to four seconds.  It's jarring to say the least, and it looks like the transfer team kept adjusting the image back and forth to clear it up in the ensuing seconds, making for an even more dizzying experience.  However, considering the age of the prints and the time these movies were made, I can easily forgive mistakes like this, but other (anal) viewers may not be so forgiving.

So, after watching all four films, how would I rate them?

""Milan Caliber 9"" is the best one, as it has everything a good euro-crime thriller should have--mystery, action, drama, romance, and an ending you will never see coming.

""The Italian Connection"" fell flat for me because of the strange performances Henry Silva and Woody Strode deliver in it and their lack of effort in searching for Luca while Luca is shooting up half the town trying to get to Don Vito.

""The Boss,"" as I said, is my favorite, because it's packed with action, double-crosses, shifty gangsters, and Henry Silva being a complete and total bad-ass, as he was meant to be.  Richard Conte also turns in a noteworthy performance in ""The Boss,"" and there's some great humor between the chief of police and the commissioner, who is an informant for Don Corasco.  The only drawback to ""The Boss"" is the ending, which leaves you with the Italian phrase for ""To Be Continued"" on it, and regrettably, it never was.

""Rulers of the City"" is very slow to start and kind-of wanders around for a good half-hour, trying to find its way, until Jack Palance comes in and tears up the joint.  As one friend put it, ""I think the plot just walked into the room.""  The movie was made in 1976, well after the Milieu trilogy, and Fernando di Leo had moved on to make a series of gangster thrillers that had lighter plots and some comedic elements to them (see his 1975 vehicle ""Loaded Guns,"" with Ursula Andress and Woody Strode, for more evidence of this).  ""Rulers of the City"" suffers from this formula, as it could have been a great bullet-riddled, double-crossing revenge flick.  It does, however, deliver in the final twenty minutes, which is nothing but a huge gun battle between Tony, Rick, their friend Napoli, and Scarface's men in an abandoned slaughterhouse.  It's wickedly awesome and clearly shows elements that John Woo would later adapt into his Hong Kong gangster thrillers (watch what Tony's shotgun does to cars and you'll see what I mean).

So is this set worth the twenty-some dollars I spent on it?  As Sarah Palin once said, ""You betcha.""  If you're a fan of euro-crime thrillers or just want to have a crackling good time flashing back to the 70's, then pick up this box set (which is cheaper than buying the individual discs) and enjoy a time when crime was rampant, crooks were smart AND tough, and old movie stars could relive their glory days as A-listers in a country called Italy.",1386720000,9,9202,4.625461254612546
8424935,5,B004D8P23U,"About two years ago, I had the privilege of reviewing the exciting The Italian Connection, as part of the formidable collection Fernando Di Leo  The Italian Crime Connection Vol. 1.  Well, it took some time, but the awesome Volume 2, including 3 more fascinating films by this remarkable Italian director, is now available. And it was well worth the wait.

The 3 movies (in 3 discs) included in this collection are all crime-related, an area in Fernando Di Leo (1932-2003) excelled. The first feature, Naked Violence (I Ragazzi del Massacro), is about the rape and murder of a teacher by some of her students, which were collectively influenced by Aniseed, referred to as the strongest liquor in the world, capable of causing powerful psychic erythrism, which leads to violence and madness. It takes detective Duca Lamberti (Pier Paolo Capponi) and social worker Livia Ussaro (Nieves Navarro) to meticulously solve the case and find the culprits. Next we have Shoot First, Die Later (Il Poliziotto  Marcio), where we meet Lieutenant Dominique Malacarne (Luc Merenda), a highly respected cop, whose proud father is also in the police force. Dominique is deeply engaged in fighting a local crime lord. Unfortunately, he also has a secret, which endangers his career and relationship with his father. Richard Conte plays Mafioso Mazzanti. The film has some funny moments, too, and one of the best car chases I have ever seen in movies. Finally, there is Kidnap Syndicate (La Citta Sconvolta. Caccia Spietata ai Rapitori), also starring Luc Merenda. Here he plays Mario Collela, a decent, working class, single father whose son is kidnapped by accident just as he was trying to defend his well-to-do classmate, who was the original target. They are both kidnapped, and we witness how Collela, as well as Ing. Filippini (James Mason) try to get their sons back. However, each one has a different way of dealing with the kidnappers. In the middle of it all, is Police Commissioner Magrini (an excellent Vittorio Caprioli), who tries to solve the crime as fast as he can.

I have to say that I truly enjoyed the three films presented in Fernando Di Leo  The Italian Crime Connection Vol. 2. They are all well crafted, with enough twists and turns until the very end, and Di Leo really shows up, step by step, the arduous work done by detectives. Not in vain the director has been referred elsewhere as the master of mafia mayhem. The collection also includes several documentaries about the films and Di Leos career, as well as a booklet with critical analyses. (Naked Violence  Italy, 1969, color, 96 min; Shoot First, Die Later  Italy, 1974, color, 94 min; Kidnap Syndicate  Italy, 1975, color, 98 min)

Italian crime cinema at its best. If you enjoyed watching Kojak, French Connection, Seven-Ups, and Shamus you are going to love this.
People say that the Godfather is the quintessential movie collection about mafia, really!? They probably did not see
De Leo's ""politzi""/mafia movies from 1970's. De Leo movies contain everything you are looking for: intrigue, action, hot women,
bad guys, good guys, semi-good guys, lots of old school hand-guns, disturbing torture scenes, awesome shoot outs and car-chase scenes, you name it---it has it all.

Get this collection quickly, and while you at it add vol. 2 as well.",1384905600,,638,5.125
