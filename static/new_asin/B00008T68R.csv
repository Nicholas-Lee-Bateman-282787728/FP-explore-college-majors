8157872,4,B00008T68R,"This DVD brings to life the many WW2 exploits of a very brave lady. She went through many harrowing experiences plus
surviving being tortured by the Gestapo.
Odette survived as did Peter Churchill who she married after the war.",1472342400,,227,4.846153846153846
8157873,5,B00008T68R,My mother so loved the story and character that my youngest sister is named Odette. Is there any way to transfer this Region 2 DVD to Region 1?,1394582400,,143,4.142857142857143
8157874,4,B00008T68R,A great role played by Anna Neagle and well supported by Trevor Howard. I found it to be quite realistic and it gave some insight into the courage of special agents and the risks they took during WW2. As it was made after the war it was probably hindered by budget constraints as tis was still a period of austerity..,1389052800,,317,4.3
8157875,3,B00008T68R,"I saw this movie as a very young girl and have waited for it to come on on DVD.
We must never forget those people that were so brave in times that were so evil.",1272758400,2,160,3.6
8157876,3,B00008T68R,"As the DVD was based on a film made in 1960 the quality was reasonable [B&W]
otherwise no problems with the product.
Quite happy

Amazon verified purchase.",1265760000,,155,4.7407407407407405
8157877,5,B00008T68R,"Odette is that rare body of work called a film that serves as a great history lesson.  In this age of teaching through multimedia, this film should be in every school library.  Anne Neagle is a star of the first rank and should not be forgotten.  Travor Howard is at his best in a performance full of compassion, strength and lightheartedness.  The film is played realistically without over the top cinematic gloss. I highly recommend it to be seen by every movie lover.  As a PAL film it will play on a computer if the resoruces aren't available to convert.",1153526400,10,558,4.54
