7540869,5,B018611N1E,"It would be difficult to add any new comments to the dozen or so (as of this writing) glowing reviews for this release.  I'll keep it short and just say that anyone who bought the Looney Toons Golden Collections simply MUST add this to their collection.  Even the title ""Golden Classics"" seems to be a nod to those earlier releases, and serves Warner Bros. notice that they still have a LOT of unfinished business in the eyes of classic animation fans.

With that in mind, I hope you'll forgive me for indulging in my own ""wish list"" for the wonderful folks at Thunderbean.  There are so many as-yet-unreleased classic cartoons out there.  Many have fallen into the public domain and have seen shoddy, unrestored releases from hacks like Alpha, Millcreek, etc.  But if they can obtain the rights, Thunderbean Animation are clearly the ones to save these works of art:

--Fleischer Studios cartoons of the 1930's.  Not just Betty Boop (although it's unforgiveable that no one has done a proper restoration of those), but funny and wild pre-Code cartoons like ""Swing You Sinners.""

--Early MGM color cartoons.  Some very colorful and charming stuff out there that easily rivals what Disney was doing at the time.

--The infamous ""Censored 11"" cartoons.  There's a rumor that WB is working on those, but I'm afraid it will be too controversial for a mainstream release (Side Note: If a 70 year old cartoon really upsets you, get some therapy).

--The Famous Studios cartoons of the 40's and 50's.  Not just Popeye, although it appears WB is never going to get around to those, either.

OK, I know I've gotten off-topic with my Wish List.  But classic animation fans know what I'm talking about.  In the meantime, please continue to support Thunderbean and get ALL their great cartoon collections.  Thanks for reading! :-)",1300665600,4,1818,4.847402597402597
7540870,5,B018611N1E,"Believe me, this is is really one of the best DVD ever released.
Steve Stanchfield of Thunderbean put his heart in this release and you can really see it!
The cartoons are beautifully restored and remastered from 35mm and 16mm elements....in short,they never looked so good!
Even if you already got the Bosko DVD that featured the Snafu cartoons you really need to buy this.
I was amazed to finally be able to see these wartime classics in such beautiful quality.

I don't have anything to add to what my seven predecessors have said, other than to express my enthusiasm for the few deicated animation fans who have made it their business to produce and distribute top-flight collections such as these.

Please support them whenever and however you can.

Beautifully restored from the ORIGINAL 35mm elements!  If you love classic Warner animation, this set is loaded with rare cartoons directed by the likes of Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and Frank Tashlin with Mel Blanc doing the voice of our ""hero"", the bumbling Pvt. Snafu, and music scores by Carl Stalling.  A fascinating slice of WWII history *and* the cartoons are still very funny and entertaining!  This first class presentation is also loaded with commentary tracks, stills galleries, rare ""A Few Quick Facts"" cartoons from studios like UPA and MGM, an all-new featurette narrated by Jerry Beck, and MORE.

7540873,5,B018611N1E,"First of all, I would like to commemerate Eric Goldberg (worked on The Genie in Aladdin and The Crocodile in The Princess and the Frog) for coming up with the best DVD cover I have ever seen.
Steve Stanch gave his heart and soul into this DVD project. He wanted these cartoons looking their very best, he knew the right people to help him along the way, and he presented it mighty finely.
The shorts have had the first class treatment in restoration, and the ones I could really tell are Goldbrick and Fighting Tools. I had seen Goldbrick before in The Looney Tunes Golden Collection series, but it was majorly slowed down. And John K. (Ren & Stimpy) really shows his appreation in his commentary for Fighting Tools.
The Private Snafu cartoon series packs alot of variety from different art styles in directors and studios, the many voice talents of Mel Blanc, favorable moments (i.e., a very amusing run cycle in Fighting Tools) and not only work from your favorite WB directors (Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and Frank Tashlin) but also writing by rhyming master Dr. Suess. with influencing, too! So, it's like a big Easter basket chocked filled with goodies!
But that's not all! If you know very little about Snafu and his history, Mr. Stanch made sure you could tell others about him with commentaries from John Krifalusi, Jerry Beck (historian & cofounder of cartoonbrew.com), Eric Goldberg, Mark Mayerson, and Mike Kazaleah. They range on informative, fun, and excited on their commentaries. There's ton of model sheets, magazine covers, stills, and even title cards for The Army/Navy Screen Magazine inwhich Snafu showed his debut!
These shorts were most important cartoons of their time (even including ours!) They were highly enjoyable to the  soilders and fighting men and women of US Army. Not only enjoyed, but also listened to.

Thumbs Up, Doc! Thumbs Up!",1294617600,15,1879,4.90566037735849

1. The SNAFUs are Warner Brothers cartoons from the peak of the studio's classic, golden age period. If you're a fan of Warner cartoons from the 1940s, you'll be a fan of these.
2. You've never seen them look as good as they do in this set by a long shot, and will probably never see them looking better.
3. If you enjoy delving more deeply, the supplementary materials, especially the commentaries by animators and animation historians are a treasure trove, and highly entertaining in their own right.
4. In case this review gets misapplied to another, inferior SNAFU collection at some point, I'll reiterate that I'm talking about ""Private SNAFU Golden Classics"" from Thunderbean Animation.
5. What do you mean you haven't bought it yet? Get with it!",1294531200,18,928,5.823529411764706
7540875,5,B018611N1E,"The quality is amazing!  They actually rival the quality of the Looney Tunes restorations on the Golden Collection, and are way better than the unrestored Snafus included in the extras.  They look brand new.  This is the definitive set of Private Snafu cartoons.

What else can I say?  Well, there are very nice extras, audio commentary, and even the cover artwork is high quality.  I love the subliminal American flag on the cover hiding in the red and white clouds and blue star-lit sky.  Very cool.

7540876,5,B018611N1E,"Thunderbean DVDs are always of the highest quality, but this one is really special. Steve Stanchfield and his team have really put together an amazing package for animation fans, with beautifully restored films from the original 35 mm elements held by the US National Archives. There is great historical material both in the well-written insert, and as supplements on the DVD.

It is very interesting to see the opening and closing title sequences from the  Army/Navy Screen Magazine, the films in which the Snafu shorts were originally presented. (Found in the Special Features section.)

in addition to the well-known Schlesinger Studios shorts, we get a few from MGM and even UPA (conplete with UPA's more stylized graphics).

The stills gallery, incuding magazine covers with Ray Harryhausen models, is a real treat

It was also fun to see the the ""Private SNAFU presents Seaman TARFU"" short for the first time, with a really fun surprise ending that I won't spoil for anywone here.

There are also lots of commentaries from some true animation legends.

7540877,5,B018611N1E,"Here it is! The ultimate, definitive, end-all Private Snafu collection! These cartoons were made to teach our troops during WWII with hilarious results. The cartoons would help troops learn about not to spread rumours, zipper your lip when you learn a secret, camoflague, and much more. The cartoons were written by Theodore Geisel (known to many as Dr. Seuss) and P.D. Eastman (who, like Seuss, also made a career writing childrens books) and directed by the great WB directors of the 40's; Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, and Frank Tashlin. Now, the fine folks at Thunderbean proudly present the ultimate collection of Private Snafu shorts. You get all 26 shorts plus all 4 A Few Quick Facts shorts featuring Snafu all brilliantly restored and remastered from the original 35mm negatives (the transfers are like on the same scale as the Looney Tunes Golden Collections) and audio commentaries with Jerry Beck, Eric Goldberg, John Kricfalusi, and more.

The quality of the prints are good to really great and for better than the previous versions of VHS's or DVD's that came before. I've been a SNAFU fan since I first saw them on USA's Night Flight back in the 80's. They're like unknown almost never seen Looney Tunes but slightly shorter, but with edgier language and nudity. Also it's great to have ""a few quick facts"" segments that I haven't seen in previous versions, along with audio commentary and other extras.

7540884,5,B018611N1E,"Army training films made mostly by the crazy Warner Brothers cartoon crews. The ubiquitous Mel Blanc does the voice of Private SNAFU. Chuck Jones, and Friz Freleng and Bob Clampett were directors. Also involved was US Army Col Theodore ""Ted"" Geisel, who wrote many of the scripts. You can hear Dr. Seuss and see the his famous critters in ""Rumors"".

The cartoons made by WB are as funny as any WB cartoons of the WW II era. Bugs Bunny makes a cameo appearance in ""Gas"" (my favorite). Since these cartoons were never shown to the public, they got away with a few ""d**ns"" and ""h*lls"" (Soldiers and sailors cussing! I'm shocked!). A couple of topless mermaids make a quick appearance in ""Camouflage"". And there is a completely-telegraphed-obvious boob joke in ""Booby Traps"". Probably a PG13 if it were rated.

The cartoons that were made by other studios, not funny. They are actual training films.

7540886,5,B018611N1E,"There's not much more I can add that hasn't been said already in the reviews for Thunderbeans monumental release of these coveted war-time cartoons. For the first time all 30 Private SNAFU shorts, including the five non-Warner Bros cartoons, together on one disc.

The animation from the great stable of Warner Bros directors and artists is first class, the rhyming stories and incidental character designs by Dr Seuss makes for a very unique mixing of styles and the ribald adult humour aimed at soldiers rather than general audiences makes these cartoons not only amusing but downright uproarious!

The restoration work on these cartoons is the real achievement here. Finally a cartoon release that presents the cartoons without Digital-Video-Noise-Removal process that degrades and thins the line quality, the colours haven't been tampered with and none of that heinous cropping or stretching. These are the cartoons as they were meant to be seen!

The DVD itself includes a generous supply of bonus features and has been beautifully designed, from the menu screens to the stylish cover art courtesy of Eric Goldberg. Bounds ahead of the official Looney Tunes DVD releases plastered with glossy licensing imagery and digitally altered facsimiles.

7540891,5,B018611N1E,"The SNAFU cartoons are fascinating from two aspects: the animators and the audience.

Private SNAFU (Situation Normal All ""Fowled"" Up) was a creation of Frank (It's a Wonderful Life) Capra to help train the troops by bad example.

These short black and white cartoons were made by Looney Tunes ' (Bug Bunny and friends) top animators such as Chuck (How the Grinch Stole Christmas) Jones, voiced by Mel Blanc (mostly) and written (among others) by Ted (Dr. Seuss) Geisel.  They are a landmark in the history of animation.

But there is more.

Made only for enlisted men,  the all male audiences were treated to mild cursing, brief animated nudity and what we call today ""adult situations.""  These are, however, mild by the jaded standards of the 21st Century.  Shown one at a time over months and year, the Private SNAFU's adventures must have been a island of humor in then otherwise grim life of G.I. Joe.

I normally don't review material that has been out for a long while, nor when others have capably done so before me. I was inspired to mention this feature, though, while watching it with my Mom, who was a teenager during WWII. We both loved it; nostalgia for her and crass humor for me. Being that these gems weren't originally intended shown for home consumption, Ma was amazed that something as entertaining as SNAFU were actually shown to servicemen as educational tools, albeit in Loony Tune Style. Kudos to Thunderbean in their restoration work; each film was clean and the sound was clear. As an American of German descent, I also thank Thunderbean for making absolutely no allusions to the political correctness of these shorts, nor making a documentary of this fact.",1370649600,,820,4.864285714285714
7540896,4,B018611N1E,"Three cheers for Thunderbean for taking the time to produce these wonderful DVDs of forgotten and obscure cartoons.
As all the other reviewers have said, the restoration is great, the shorts are very funny, and the commentaries and extras are informative and entertaining. So I have nothing to add there to what has already been said.

I will, however, note a couple of minor downsides that have not been mentioned in the other reviews. (Constructive criticisms they might consider when working on the next release!)

1. No subtitles.  This is particularly annoying when you're listening to the commentary tracks. Without subtitles it's hard to follow the story.
2. I find the menus a wee bit hard to navigate.  It's hard to tell where the cursor is, resulting, frequently, in clicking on the wrong heading. (On some of the menus, every link is a different color, making it hard to tell when you've clicked on the right one.
3. Shipping was very slow. (I received the disk 12 days after my credit card was charged.) Thunderbean is in Ann Arbor, MI.  I'm about 300 miles away.",1330992000,5,1075,4.789189189189189

The menu's are simple, play all, select a specific cartoon and special features.
I ordered from the Uk, came within 2 weeks, good timing...
Now, Thunderbean - Mr Stanchfield and his team have pulled out every stop for this set.
In a basic dvd box with a beautiful cover of Snafu, the set has a small booklet with director credits, fun facts.
The special features are Still Galleries, Alt Sountracks, A Few Quick Facts with Animation Historian Jerry Beck, Commentaries and Army and Nave screen magazine titles.
I need to say, the restoration is AMAZING. I cant not fault it, it could pass better than a Warner LTGC set.
The commentaries were fun to listen too. I really enjoyed Eric Goldberg and Jerry Beck. I respect John K, but his devotion to Bob Clampett is admirable, but mildly annoying but he does point out some great features on ""Booby Traps"" - Directed by Clampett himself.
I might also add none of these shorts are edited, cut or censored.
Also, look out for a special for rabbit in one of the shorts!!
