I sat down happily to review this collection of Don's shows including CPO Sharkey. Let me start by saying I am a huge Don Rickles fan. This is a wonderful collection of the best of Don!  I know a lot of people know Don Rickles as the voice of Mr. Potato Head in Toy Story but I have been watching him from the past 43 of my 49 years at least.

From the very beginning with Don Rickles, Don Adams, Harvey Korman and that hot guy who I can't remember...It was so fun. Just a bunch of friends sitting in chairs chatting with an audience. It seemed very real, unscripted and funny.

This is a great gift for anyone who loves Don or loves comedy.

I loved CPO Sharkey. Don played a Navy Chief Petty Officer in charge of new recruits.  The running jokes were usually about Don's height as opposed to his assistant Seaman Lester who was very tall.  My sisters and I loved this show!

7382903,3,B0143SH8EU,"My parents love Don Rickles' type of humor.  So I was thrilled when I saw this ULTIMATE TV collection and knew I just had to buy it for them. Without giving anything away as far as content goes, the DVDs of his television appearances were abbreviated and not all that funny.  He and Don Adams were supposed to be ""hilarious"" but I don't think I heard my parents laugh more than a couple of times.

However, Don Rickles' series CPO Sharkey, that lasted only two seasons, was the definite bright spot of this entire collection. I watched a couple of episodes myself and found them entertaining. So, if you love Don Rickles' humor, catch him all over YouTube when he performed on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts or when he was a guest on Johnny Carson or David Letterman's show.  And then simply buy the boxed set of CPO Sharkey which will end up costing you way less money.",1495324800,2,872,4.465408805031447

His appearances on the Tonight Show and Letterman were by far much more entertaining. All in all good to have in your collection if you like early 1970's Rickles style comedy.",1534118400,,316,4.283333333333333
8729601,2,B0143SH8EU,Not what I was thinking. Limited stand up and more about his show that was a failure. He exceled on stage which I wish this would have been more of.,1533513600,,148,3.966666666666667
