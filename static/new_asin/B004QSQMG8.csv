The visuals are great and while the concepts and some of the dialogue is over his head, we all find ourselves riveted watching this. Great DVD.",1313884800,3,275,4.411764705882353
4455299,4,B004QSQMG8,"If you are curious as to how the universe creates things, this DVD series is for you.  You will learn about how galaxies, planets, and stars are created.  You will also learn how they will expire and what the universe will be like in the future.  So if you are interested in this, then I highly recommend this DVD series for you!  :D",1313798400,9,333,4.238095238095238
4455300,5,B004QSQMG8,"I really loved this series!  It is well written, great graphics, and good commentary.  Very difficult concepts explained in very simple terms that are easy to understand.  I recommend them to anyone that loves physics and the universe.",1312761600,5,235,5.131578947368421
4455301,5,B004QSQMG8,"I love this series.  I have found it to be more informative - in a lower level and a higher level of understanding than Through the Wormhole.  Wormhole seems to focus on all of these possible ""out there"" concepts - Higgs Boson, the origin of the universe, before the big bang - this series focuses more on what we do know - and how we came to know it.  It wasn't for sale when I was watching it on TV - so what did I do?  I called the Science Channel and left them a message stating ""you MUST sell this DVD - it's amazing, incredible, and I want to show my students the excerpt on Supernovas"".  I know that my science non-major students and my science major students will watch the episode on supernovas and be able to understand and appreciate the creation of atoms.  I am so happy this went on sale - I was so excited that I had my institution pre-order it!  I recommend it to anyone interested in the cosmos, interested in science, and interested in learning.  Start here, work your way to Wormhole, and then top it off with Unlocking the Universe - the trifecta of videos!",1312675200,121,1076,4.266009852216749
4455302,5,B004QSQMG8,"Our family had long been on the pre-order list waiting for this 2-dvd set to arrive.  Now that it has, we all agree that if we had known what an excellent (""excellent"" is truly an understatement.  ""Magnificent"" would be more accurate!)set this would be, we would have all been a lot more impatient for its arrival, but then we might have missed the surprise.  By all means, start at the beginning with the Big Bang (track one on disc one), and then when you've seen Black Holes (track two on disc one),... well, we won't say more, but be prepared for some surprising revelations.  It is just incredible how far astronomers have come since the last round of dvds dealing with how the universe works, especially with how ""black holes"" work and the part they play in completing the circle on ""how the universe works"".  This program will catch you up in no uncertain terms, and it's our bet that you'll love every minute of it.  The graphics are superb, and keep in mind that they are illustrating information that has not been presented so beautifully and clearly before (as far as we know). Even if you have been following technical research closely, you'll be thrilled to see the fresh twist on the computer graphics.  Personally, we found the scientific and philosophical aspects so unforcedly entertwined as to make this series a joy for those who lean toward either ""pure science alone"" or toward ""intelligent design"" (we have both in our family).  This series can speak to us all in its effort to do justice to what in anyone's terms can be unreservedly recognized as ""magnificent design"". Once again, in our family's unanimous view, this is, at least to date, an unparalleled presentation, which we unconditionally recommend.",1309910400,230,1729,4.797979797979798
4455303,5,B004QSQMG8,"I saw the entire ""How the Universe Works"" series when it premiered on Science Channel in January and have been eagerly awaiting its DVD release ever since. The commentators are interesting-I especailly liked black hole hunter Dr. Andrea Ghez and ""Bad Astronomer"" himself,Dr. Phil Plait, and Mike Rowe's narration was well-done; but the visuals were the real star. To me, it felt like actually cruising through the universe in a spaceship. But, like almost every other show about supernovae, they get it wrong and have sound effects when stars explode. Remember the tagline for ""Alien"": In space, NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM. :-)",1308614400,102,627,5.038461538461538

4455335,1,B004QSQMG8,Loved Season 1.  Worth watching.  Narrators changed in Season 2.  I just could not listen to the second narrator's intellectual whimpering.  Michio Kaku is great and should have been the narrator for the remake of Carl Sagan's Cosmos.,1517529600,,234,5.078947368421052

4455337,1,B004QSQMG8,"I just finished the first episode and am very disappointed. There are many theories presented as fact. Some of those theories are very flawed, like stars formed from gas condensing
Huh?
Gas tends to dissipate due to a phenomenon known as Brownian motion. Dissipation is the opposite of condensing, so to say that a gas compresses onto itself (condenses) makes no sense. Brownian motion is stronger than gravity, or there would be no Brownian motion (dissipation) anywhere. All gasses everywhere would have compressed onto themselves long ago.
Given the strength of Brownian motion, why would gasses just compress on themselves. Some outside influence on the gasses maybe?  That process should be fairly common, given the uncountable abundance of stars in the universe. But it isn't a common occurrence at all (like I said, its never been observed and if it has, please show me). We have no reasonable scientific theories about how stars form.
Short version: gas doesnt compress onto itself, and we don't know how stars form.

The presentation claims that all matter came from stars. But stars cant fuse past iron, so where did the heavier elements come from? And so stars with heavier elements in them pose the which came first, the chicken (star) or the egg (heavy element) quandary that has yet to be answered by science.
The announcer says Each nebula is a star nursery, where millions of stars are being born.
Wow! With millions of stars being born, we would expect to be shown at least one star birth. But we arent. We aren't shown a star birth because nobody has ever observed a star being born in the nebulas, or anywhere else for that matter. The announcer is stating supposition as fact. Supposition based on a deeply flawed theory of star formation that relies on the ludicrous notion that a gas compresses onto itself in a vacuum. There is no scientific theory that shows with any reasonable certainty that stars form in nebulas.
One of the celebrity scientists says We could not see the first moments of a star at all...
The announcer goes on Until 2004, when NASA launched the Spitzer space telescope...
It shows us heat (stars or galaxies), either from stars that were already within the nebulas or from galaxies and stars on the other side of the nebulas. There is no way to be sure what the sources are. Because the infra-red telescope shows us stars/galaxies we couldn't see before this particular telescope went up, were told that the stars are new, and that we witnessed their birth. The fact is, that we still haven't seen a star born. This is an example of what I mean when I say that conjecture is being presented as fact. The supposition is that because we couldn't see these stars before the Spitzer and didn't know they were there, these particular stars weren't there. Since we can now see them with the Spitzer, they must have just been born. That really is the logic used in this presentation.
Then the announcer says that photons reaching the surface of the sun create extreme turbulence and intense shockwaves ok. Plenty true. But then he adds Its so violent, we can actually hear it. Yea, he actually said that. He even called it sound. At the 20 min mark. Listen to it.
Lots of supposition presented as fact, this first episode looks like an attempt to dazzle young children. I have no problem with that, so long as scientific accuracy is maintained. Mostly I found it to be annoying because of so many deeply flawed assumptions being presented as facts. If one didn't know the truth, he could very easily be misled on many levels. I would not recommend it for any age group.",1516406400,2,3607,4.732909379968204
4455338,5,B004QSQMG8,"Got this as a gift, but the recipient seems to think they already know how the Universe (and everything else works) so I ended up watching them myself

4455341,5,B004QSQMG8,"I grew up watching Sagan's Cosmos as well as the recent remake, and numerous other shows about astronomy and cosmology.  This is, in my opinion, the best one I have seen to date.  The graphics are superb, the narration is the right mix between calm and dramatic, and the universe comes alive in new ways based on the latest research and theories.  In addition to the graphics segments, numerous noted men and women in the field (including the charismatic Michio Kaku) provide further explanation and commentary, and their passion for their subject matter comes through.  I think young viewers may be inspired by the human presenters to take a further interest in an already astounding field.

I think this program presents the scientific view and the latest theories in a simple and straightforward manner, but allows the majesty and complexity of the universe to speak for itself, which can also appeal to audience members with a more theological/intelligent design world view.

If you binge watch the show, certain segments may seem repetitious, but it's because each episode focuses so specifically on one aspect of the universe that sometimes information overlaps topics.  However, that is no deterrent to enjoying what is a superlative documentary series.",1506988800,3,1260,5.147058823529412

4455353,5,B004QSQMG8,"Disappointed in the quality of streaming video. The Blu-ray is gorgeous.

Our solar system has 9 planets, not 8. Pluto is the 9th planet.

As an astronomer I say, Pluto is the 9th planet.

The efforts of a very small clique of Pluto-haters within the International Astronomical Union (IAU) plutoed Pluto in 2006. Of the approximately 10,000 internationally registered members of the IAU in 2006, only 237 voted in favor of the resolution redefining Pluto as a dwarf planet while 157 voted against; the other 9,500 members were not even present at the closing session of the IAU General Assembly in Prague at which the vote to demote Pluto was taken. Yet Plutos official planetary status was snatched away.

Well, it turns out that the 2006 IAU decision has been almost universally rejected both by astronomers and the general public.  The IAU is not a police force, and scientists decide for themselves what to call things.  Pluto has 5 known moons: Charon (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.

The name Pluto, after the god of the underworld, was proposed by Venetia Burney (19182009), a then eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology.  She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues in the United States.

The New Mexico House of Representatives passed a resolution in honor of Clyde Tombaugh (the discoverer of Pluto) , a longtime resident of that state, that declared that Pluto will always be considered a planet while in New Mexican skies and that March 13, 2007, was Pluto Planet Day. The Illinois Senate passed a similar resolution in 2009, on the basis that Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, was born in Illinois. The resolution asserted that Pluto was ""unfairly downgraded to a 'dwarf' planet"" by the IAU.  Many members of the public have also rejected the change, citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue, or for sentimental reasons, maintaining that they have always known Pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of the IAU decision.

Pluto should have been ""grandfathered in"" as a planet 11 years ago, regardless as to its technical characteristics. Of all the planets, our kids loved Pluto. It was easy and fun to say and had the same name as a lovable Disney character. Pluto raised my kids' interest in astronomy and the sciences. Demoting Pluto was just plain cruel. As to other objects, I believe a conventional planet is 1) something that orbits a sun (not a planet), and 2) is large enough to have sufficient gravity to make it round.

As a friend of mine at NASA said, ""It would prove our humanity to let Pluto stay in."" It would be like that moment when the doorman is about to escort you out of a private party where you don't, arguably, belong, but then someone who knows you taps him on the shoulder and says, ""Wait a minute, I know this guy. He's O.K.""

The 2 Blu-rays are an excellent series on astronomy. Highly recommended.",1491696000,,3190,4.841911764705882

I also loved that Mike Rowe narrated this.  His voice just has a natural and soothing quality about it that the new How the Universe Works 2 is lacking.  Doesn't change the information given, he just has a better narration voice.",1463788800,,475,4.222222222222222

I can't figure out why anyone would make a dvd like this, that's supposed to be informative, then put a music soundtrack on it that plays so consistently, and so loudly, that you have to strain to hear what the narrator and others are saying. It's unbelievable, and it's irritating. It's like trying to carry on a conversation while sitting six feet from an orchestra. A very loud orchestra playing bad music.

4455743,5,B004QSQMG8,"I'm a big fan of these genre of shows (e.g. Cosmos, Into the Universe with Stephan Hawking).  This is one of my favorites.  The narration by Mike Rowe is superb, he has a way of talking to you like a friend you've known a long time.  Not condescending or superfluous as some shows can be.  Another thing I quite like about this show is the musical score.  It's queued up very well with what's going on in the show, but maintains an air of calmness.  In fact I've come to watch this to help me fall asleep, not because it's boring (they keep it quite interesting), but because Mike Rowe and the music are so calming.  The show manages to be insightful and educational, while also being cinematic and entertaining.  To this end most shows sacrifice one thing or the other.

It's no longer on Netflix, and the visuals are very well done, worth getting BluRay for.

If you're coming to this genre of documentary after enjoying the Cosmos, Interstellar, Stephan Hawking's work, or any other similar work, this is a great show to get more content and a better understanding of How the Universe Works.",1419206400,,1094,4.535714285714286

4455783,5,B004QSQMG8,"If you are even remotely curious about astronomy, this is for you! Test drive it by watching it on TV if you must but I guarantee you will learn something no matter how old you are.

The CGI in this series is top notch and the program is totally immersive. The explanation by the scientists is spot on for novices and you need not be embarrassed to replay certain parts or watch with the closed caption turned on because you want to understand.

Also, the re-watchability rating on this is very high. When you own this you are not pressed with having to get things the first time. So you watch it again later and the second time around you will understand the parts you got before better and be astonished at the stuff you missed.

If you wonder about the after life, whether there is a God or whatnot...it doesn't matter. This program doesn't try to sway your beliefs one way or another.

And lastly, it is beautiful. The world we live in and the surrounding universe with it's stars and planets is magnificent. And you can explore this all from the comfort of your home.",1404777600,4,1072,4.426395939086294
4455784,1,B004QSQMG8,"Every episode starts of with the ""Big Bang"" theory and gives no other possibility.  God created the universe, with a wave of his hand !  It's in His Holy word.  Therefore, that's the believer's ""Big Bang""...but this one is not a theory !",1402704000,4,237,4.465116279069767

This is the stuff you sit down and watch with your children.  Teach them and teach them well.
They need to know about the reality upon which we are dependent, rather than leave it in the hands of manipulators, crazy politicians and anti-science criminals.",1397692800,,360,4.625

4455792,5,B004QSQMG8,"Not only was the coverage of the subject matter fantastic in this first season of the series, but Mike Rowe narrated it!  He managed to be respectful and snarky, both at the same time, and elevated an already great series even higher.

The subsequent seasons without Mike Rowe just demonstrated how fantastic he was in his narration, and I wish he would do more narration of the science series.  I think he would entice more people to get interested in science.",1395532800,2,461,4.666666666666667

4455808,5,B004QSQMG8,"It's obvious our limited minds were not designed to grasp the infinite.  When you hear about stars, that are much larger than our own sun, being tossed around at millions of miles per hour around a super gigantic black hole, you start to realize how small we are in the great scheme of things.  There are countless billions of stars in our own galaxy and the nearest one is 4 light years away.  So, if you traveled at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, it would take you 4 years to get there.  That's amazing stuff.  Great show.",1394150400,,539,4.35

4455811,5,B004QSQMG8,"Received my Blu-Ray DVD set of ""How The Universe Works"" quickly, brand new, and factory-packed just as advertised. The price was unbeatable and the quality is superb. The visuals are simply outstanding for the lack of a better term. And the experts explain in plain English (no offense) the theories of how everything we are and see around us actually came into existence, starting at the beginning with ""The Big Bang"". If you have seen these programs on The Science Channel HD, then you may be surprised to learn that these Blu-Ray DVDs will deliver even better picture quality than you see on The Science Channel, which is also very good, to say the least. After all, it's an HD channel for crying-out-loud.

So, whether you're looking for amazing picture and sound quality or a truly informative explanation of the cosmos - or maybe a little of both, you're shopping in the right department. This is the DVD set that every space junkie should own.",1393459200,2,950,4.757575757575758

Using expert teachers and state-of-the-art digital animations, it teaches the fundamentals of cosmology clearly, making the concepts accessible to the interested layperson. It's a great treatment of an amazing topic. Mike Rowe narrates, and Michio Kaku leads a strong group of astronomers and theoretical physicists in explaining some of the most difficult concepts in science.

4455865,3,B004QSQMG8,"It's ok.  It has a decent amount of good information in it but way too much repetition.  They use the same pictures over and over and over.  They also repeat the same things over and over and over again.  It can make watching this painfully long and can easily make someone lose interest after seeing and hearing the same stuff so many times.  I would recommend it, for the information it does contain.  You can learn many things from it.  If you're easily offended by the big bang theory though, you might not want to watch this.  That's pretty much the premise of the whole series.  However, despite all the theorizing and questions they raise that they have no answers for, there is some good, solid, well established information to be gleaned from watching this.  That is, if you can survive the repetition.",1386115200,4,811,4.608391608391608

4455875,5,B004QSQMG8,This is another one of Discovery Channel DVD's that is full of both educational and informative material.

There IS a difference, and we should not pretend that there is not. Case in point: Presenting the big bang ""theory"" as accepted fact, even though it is IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION with the Universal LAW of entropy.

4455880,4,B004QSQMG8,"Speaking as someone who taught physics and astronomy at USC, this series is excellent. A lot of science shows on TV are watered down to meaninglessness, many also filled with nonsense about UFOS and discredited sightings of alien creatures.

4455882,5,B004QSQMG8,"One of many things I enjoy watching and reading about is Astronomy.  About this big black space we all live under within the planet earth we call the Universe. This series teaches you (me) many things you may or may NOT have already known, about galaxies, black holes, etc... Very interesting and how the technology to make this show, when you're watching it makes you feel like you're actually traveling thru space. I'm just glad I'm not going be around in the two billion years, when our galaxy ends up inside the black hole in the middle of it that keeps pulling into it with its gravity. (at the rate we humans are going living with others ourselves as humans, I'll be surprise if we even last another 50 years as a species and destroy ourselves before then, it is really ashamed) However, after watching this episodes, there is no doubt in my mind, that there just HAVE to be more life out there and definitely more 'intelligent' life than ours, probably.",1379808000,,960,4.5813953488372094

4455888,4,B004QSQMG8,"This was impressive visually.  Great graphics and presentation with intelligent narration.  The episodes cover virtually everything to do with astronomy and cosmology.  If I had a quibble, there is a lot of repetition of the same images of stars and facts relating to them which overkills some points.  Overall though, pretty well done.",1379116800,,336,5.283018867924528
4455889,5,B004QSQMG8,"This series covers the current understanding of science with regards to stars, the Big Bang, the lifecycle of solar systems and galaxies, and the history of the universe in a way that I was available when I was in school. Each episode covers a specific topic in detail and provides interviews with the physicists and astronomers who have been working to unravel the universe's mysteries--and the information is presented in a way that non-physicists and non-astronomers can readily understand. Mike Rowe's narration is just gravy. :-)

For me, the best part is that in addition to having a video compendium of scientific knowledge, this series uses the latest in CGI animation to illustrate the scientific explanations and lend understanding in a way that was not really possible before. This should be required for middle/high school science classes learning about the laws of physics ... and maybe we'd wind up with more scientists and fewer politicians.",1378252800,,956,5.167741935483871

The only reason why I did not give this five stars is because there is an updated duplicate of this show with new discoveries and added content. That release gets five stars.

4455910,3,B004QSQMG8,"Someday we'll have a nicely-produced science show that isn't afraid of math.  I'm not talking about showing every formula or deriving anything, but I get the impression that the producers and editors hamstrung the scientists and forced them to avoid anything mathematical.  Dr. Kaku's popular books are like that as well, even going so far as to describe how elegant and simple a formula would be if he deigned to show it, but not showing it.  It's frustrating to watch this.  A couple animated Feynman diagrams, etc. and this kind of show might be useful to college students.  But this seems like it's just meant for middle school kids.

The graphics in this series are OK, very glitzy, but not necessarily scientifically accurate.  A bit better understanding of the science could help the graphic artists as well as the audience.

To summarize, fewer explosions, better illustrations, and maybe a real process simulation or two and this could be genuinely useful to understanding science, not just appreciating it.",1373760000,4,1016,5.041916167664671

I know a bit about this subject, and thought the information provided was pretty good and put into context well for the lay person learning about this for the first time.  What prompted me to write was the first review, which talked about the CGI being ""amazing"" etc.  I do not agree.  For this episode the creators came up with about 5 different visuals for the ""big bang"" and repeated each of them many, many times.  There is one particular one in blue, viewed from the side, which they must have shown 15 times.  This is amazing, but not in the good way.  Also, I found the narrator's tone and pacing to be distracting, never a good thing.  He also came across as one of those sarcastic narrators you may have encountered in other documentaries; not to my liking, but perhaps it will be to yours.

The graphics visualizations of the Big Bang, supernovae, atom fusions etc. are awesome and really make these phenomena come to life. Moreover, the experts on the show present the science in such an impressively attractive and entertaining manner. It is impossible to escape their vivid enthusiasm and the fascination with the subjects they study. No matter whether you know a lot or you know nothing about astronomy, these DVDs are right for you.

Its all there in full, fantastic color and detail from the fabulous author and creative geniuses at Discovery!

Consider the role of Jupiter. Its huge gravitational influence protects our solar system from rouge asteriods, sweeping them off into space. Just right orbit, just right distance from the sun, just right planets, just right star, just right collision to create the moon. We are here because God fashioned earth through the process of natural laws, guiding things into place.

4455944,1,B004QSQMG8,I had really high hopes for this series but was thoroughly disappointed when I watched it to find out that most of the 'visuals' is a couple cheap 3 second CGI clips looped together throughout each episode.

4455947,4,B004QSQMG8,"Great computer graphics, however, little repetitive, hence the four star rating as opposed to a five.

4455949,5,B004QSQMG8,"Abstract ideas, such as the vastness of the cosmos, are only palpable through the assistance of artistic, visual renditions from computer models. Interviews with the leading physics experts on the subject offer interesting quips and insight into this difficult-to-grasp topic. The search continues to find who we are and where we fit into the grand scheme of existence, and informative documentaries such as this spark questions in even the untrained, common mind, of people like myself.",1365984000,,487,5.421052631578948

I bet not many people would ever think that one day there will be no more Earth because of the death of our star, The Sun. It's not a matter of if....it's a matter of when. Of course we are talking about billions of years from now. But just the thought of our Earth would one day be no more, is simply captivating. If these type things intrigue you then you will love this series. Very informative and interesting. My only complaint is that there's not enough seasons and episodes.",1364947200,,656,4.512605042016807

At first I thought I had bought it too soon, then I looked at the descriptions.  My version, the DVD, has a run time of 480 minutes and the Blu-ray  version only 344 minutes.  That's a difference of about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  I have no idea what they left out on the blu-ray version, but that's a lot of time.  I'm glad I have the DVD version!",1364947200,,453,3.9555555555555557

Second if you are not sure if this will meet your expectation on learning about the universe let me tell you it will. Its about 10 hours of video and in such a good video quality. I play it to my other brothers and they have no interest on astronomy, phisics, etc and they got hooked so easy.

4455983,4,B004QSQMG8,"This is a great series.  All eight episodes are mind-blowing and have changed my perspective on life, the universe and everything.  The ONLY thing that is bad is the sound quality.  At times the sound drifts in and out making you have to adjust the sound from the TV or home theater system.  I first saw this on NETFLIX  and there was the same problem.  Mike Rowe is great as usual making making it easy to see how the universe works.",1360713600,3,434,4.296296296296297

4455993,5,B004QSQMG8,"Many shows about space have extremely technical, scientific explanations that are way over children's heads.  My 7 yr old absolutely loved this series, the scientists in these shows often use metaphors/analogies to explain events and theories in a way he can understand.  Any science show that can keep a young boy completely entranced for all 7 episodes (during a day off from school, at that!) has to be pretty entertaining!",1356998400,,426,5.071428571428571

There's really just one big problem here, and that's that the show is in 1080i video. As someone who likes to backup his movies to a computer to stream to the TV, I am troubled by 1080i video due to the lack of open-source codecs for it. There also isn't a lot of complex/fast motion in this type of show, so there's really no reason for it to not be presented in 1080p.",1354406400,,512,4.069306930693069

Mike Rowe is just fantastic in this series and narrates in the simplest terms that is able to keep a 5 yo's attention through an entire episode. The CGI and graphics are spectacular on Blu-Ray and the sound quality is plenty good through standard TV speakers.

4456010,3,B004QSQMG8,"...with beautiful video.  However, it's repititious both from a content and re-use of the same video perspective. Same beautiful shots over and over, like a reality TV show would do.  To the point where I'm looking forward to the end of the episode due to the annoying 'repeat' factor.

To reiterate, very informative, beautiful video and sound, however, presented in a format that can become very annoying.",1350345600,9,407,5.044776119402985

It also helps a great deal in framing a perspective about my problems of the day.  All issues seem small and easy to forget when compared with such enormous perspective.  Thank you for having one season available for free instant download. I wish Amazon would consider having more free instant videos from this series.

4456016,5,B004QSQMG8,"First off, HD quality is good to great. HD sound is also good to great.

How the Universe Works is a fantastic blend of live shots on location (like the shots from CERN), fantastic special effects, smooth narration (Mike Rowe - guy from ""Dirty Jobs""), and guest cameos from some of the big names in astronomy/physics/theoretical physics/etc.

Reasons to consider How the Universe Works:
1) HTUW goes into far greater detail than Wonders of the Solar System
2) HTUW features numerous big names in astronomy/physics. In addition to the narrator, these people share in explaining the concepts
3) Fantastic special effects which do justice to the events they are recreating
4) Great explanations of complex concepts

Reasons to consider Wonders of the Solar System:
1) The location shots can be pretty interesting
2) Brian Cox (assuming you like his style, delivery, etc)
3) The series offers a bit more human personality then How the Universe Works
4) Avoids going into great (sometimes boring) detail into the concepts (good for beginners)
5) Features more real life images, as opposed to CGI models (which are fantastic when done in both series)

If you're a fan of astronomy/science, then I'd recommend picking up both series as they work well together and do not overlap much. For example, HTUW goes into great detail regarding the Big Bang, while this is not touched on in Wonders of the Solar System (for obvious reasons).  Regardless of which one you get, be sure to take a look at Carl Sagan's earth-shattering series, ""Cosmos"".  The series is, even today, ahead of its time.",1341705600,4,1580,4.943396226415095

Also the two disks are redundant rehashing the same points. Some excellent animation to show what is out there but you may notice that the scientists say different numbers when speaking about the ""facts""!
As a University educated science major I found not enough new material but for kids or lay people this could be a very interesting leap into the theories going around. Starting with the Big Bang theory was a mistake I think as it has all but totally been abandoned. The ""Law"" of ""conservation of energy"" dictates that you can not get something from nothing! Especially if your talking about the nearly infinite mass of the universe, Duh!
The point is: theories are Sci-fi and Laws are fact. Wait for theories to become Laws!",1336262400,9,876,4.73202614379085

1) Extreme Stars, 2) Black Holes, 3) Big Bang, 4) Alien Galaxies, 5) Alien Solar Systems, 6) Extreme Planets, 7) Alien Moons, and 8) Supernovas.

Here is the detailed description from the Discovery cahnnel website:
""A fascinating How The Universe Works DVD, will give you a front-row seat to the inner workings of our world. See how stars were engineered, how deadly black holes can be and get the scoop on the Big Bang Theory. Also in a Universe DVD, watch as scientists discuss all that is alien, extreme plants and finally the immense explosions, also known as supernovas. An outer Space DVD is a must-have for anyone interested in the science of the Universe and all that it encompasses.

A How The Universe Works DVD, begins by engineering the Universe and shows you how the cosmos is designed, built, and actually works. From the beginning of time, Stars, Galaxies, Planets, Solar Systems, and more have been working individually and together to produce all that is and all that we see. See, in the Universe DVD, as never before the inner workings of our world, and explore black holes, supernovae, neutron stars, dark energy, and all the titanic forces that make us who we are. With a dynamic cast of experts and a new generation of CGI, Engineering the Universe looks under the celestial hood to reveal the inner workings of outer space: the story of how it's made and how it runs. An outer Space DVD is your ultimate Cosmos Operator's Manual.

Buy the How The Universe Works DVD and join experts as they reveal the creation, expansion and operation of outer space.

Extreme Stars
This program tells the story of how stars were engineered by the Universe and how Stars then went on to engineer everything else in that very universe. We'll learn how nuclear fusion in the core of these stars keeps them burning for billions of years and is what powers our nearest star 'the sun'. They transformed the Universe by spawning further generations of stars, then planets and eventually the building blocks of life itself. We will follow the life-cycle of stars from 'red giants' like our own sun that die leaving beautiful 'planetary nebula', to massive 'red supergiants' which die young in violent events called supernovae, creating elements from the gold in our wedding rings to the iron in our blood.

Black Holes
Black Holes are the most powerful and deadly destroyers in the Universe and the most mysterious phenomena in the heavens, incredible chilling consequences of the forces that hold the Cosmos together. For years they were only speculation, now modern astronomy is proving them frighteningly real and showing that these monsters may well be pulling the cosmic strings, controlling the shape of everything we see. We will learn how they are born from the deaths of massive stars, what it might be like to travel in to a black hole and that soon we might be able to get an actual glimpse of the super massive black hole at the heart of our milky way.

Big Bang
This program tells the greatest story ever told, the origin of space and the origin of time. We witness the Big Bang, the moment of creation and the birth of everything that we see around us. Thirteen point seven billion years ago there was nothing, no space, no time. Out of nothing, explodes an infinitely hot and dense soup that rapidly expands from the size of a subatomic particle to the size of a galaxy in a fraction of a second. Then the formation of fundamental forces that shape our Universe, the epic battle between matter and antimatter and the creation of the first particles that make up the cells in your body, the ground beneath our feet and the stars in the night sky. This is the most important time in history with more happening in the first second to shape our Universe than in the 13 billion years since.

Alien Galaxies
Galaxies, home to stars, planets and us, come in all shapes and sizes. From majestic spirals to giant balls of stars and gas, these immense cities of stars are the building blocks of the Universe itself. How the Universe Works witnesses the evolution of galaxies; from clouds of cold gas 13 billion years ago, to the magnificent spirals that fill our night sky. Super-massive black holes, dark, giant monsters lurking in the heart of galaxies, and mysterious dark matter, the glue that holds galaxies together. Filaments of gas, link galaxies up in a colossal cosmic web to form the largest structure in the Universe and protects them from an even more enigmatic force""dark energy, that threatens to rip the universe apart.

Alien Solar Systems
The Solar System -- eight planets and a star; our familiar, stable corner of the universe. But how much do we really know about its formation? And is it unique? Recent discoveries are revealing its secrets -- a brutal history of colliding planets, some devoured by the sun, whilst future models predict a violent death. Since the first discovery of a planet orbiting another star in 1992, some 280 alien solar systems have been identified. It's only by looking at solar systems far beyond our own, that we can understand just how remarkable our small patch of universe really is.

Extreme Planets
There are just eight planets in our solar system, but there could be a hundred billion in our Milky Way galaxy alone. As we enter into a golden age of planetary discovery the possibilities are endless. Pushing out deep into space we are finding planets that are stranger than we could ever have imagined -- from giant burning gas spheres to icy orphaned worlds wandering in interstellar space. So just how did they get to be so different? How the Universe Works follows the remarkable journey of planets as they grow from grains of dust to the magnificently diverse worlds we see today.

Alien Moons
Recent explorations have revealed moons to be the chemistry labs of the cosmos and the most likely places where we might find life beyond our planet. While some moons are no more than asteroids caught by the snare of gravity; others are part of giant family systems and almost planets in their own right. Some of the most diverse worlds in the Universe, we know of 300 moons just in our own Solar System, but there may be billions. How these moons are born, live, and die is fundamental to understanding our planet's turbulent origins and our place in the Universe.

Supernovas
Stars are not eternal; they are dying all the time in unimaginably large explosions, called supernovas. Second only to the Big Bang, the explosions are where the very essence of creation and destruction meet. Deep in the core of a massive star gold, lead, oxygen, and every other complex element, is created. When the star's nuclear furnace runs empty these vital materials are hurled across space, creating all the planets, plants and oceans we see today. Supernovas even made us, right down to the iron in our blood. Only now have we begun to understand how these wonders in our sky work -- and what they can teach us about the origins of the universe and ultimately, its future.""",1327276800,19,7355,4.729329173166927
4456039,5,B004QSQMG8,"All of the reviews on this Spectacular series say it all. I normally do not write reviews but this series deserves another 5 Star rating! The only down side I can see is that there are not enough episodes.

This 2 Disc set includes the following 8 episodes;
 Disc 1) Big Bang, Black Holes, Alien Galaxies, Extreme Stars.
 Disc 2) Extreme Planets, Supernovas, Alien Solar Systems, Alien Moons.

There are plenty of experts, and Mike Rowe does a great job narrating. In the episode Big Bang, the camera pans away from Dr. Michio Kaku in Central Park. It begins with a close up of him with a bottle of water and pans back in a seamless overhead view that eventually takes you to the edge of the universe.
Another favorite of mine is the size comparison of Earth to our Sun, and then our Sun to other giant stars in the episode Extreme Stars. Earth almost disappears when put next to our Sun, not to mention how our Sun shrinks in size compared to Eta Carinae, disappearing altogether when Eta Carinae is compared to Betelgeuse. And we haven't seen the largest star, VY Canis Majoris.

4456046,5,B004QSQMG8,"A series of eight well-constructed episodes, each about 45 minutes long, ""How the Universe Works"" explains, in language that won't make you feel like you've bitten off more than you could chew, a bit about the cosmos: what holds it together, how the various components (from matter and energy to stars, planets and nebulae) interact, and how it all works. The visuals are stunning, the musical score only further enhances this series, and the interviews with physicists, astronomers and other scientists in the field help to break down a bit about what science knows about space, what the scientists theorize, and their rationale behind the theories. As other reviewers have stated, this series is very intriguing but doesn't use a lot of technical jargon; it's explained very clearly and very concisely, so that ""Average Joe and Jane"" at home can follow along with the eight very gripping and very interesting episodes.

One can't argue with the price either - very agreeable. It seems like Amazon.com is almost giving this series away, considering how packed it is with information.

Bottom line: Extremely highly recommended, whether astronomy/cosmology is a genuine interest of yours, or whether you've ever looked up on a starry night and wondered, ""How does it all work?""",1322179200,34,1277,5.134615384615385
