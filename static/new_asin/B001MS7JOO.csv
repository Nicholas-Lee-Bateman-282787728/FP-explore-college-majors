8321631,5,B001MS7JOO,This documentary is very-much worth watching especially if you grew up in the Catholic faith and/or attended Catholic School as a child.  There are also some very interesting historical aspects brought up as well.  I highly recommend this film!,1255737600,2,244,5.230769230769231
