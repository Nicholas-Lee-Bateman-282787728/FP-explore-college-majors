8577911,5,B00C77VYA4,"3 different funny movies that are all worth watching more then once, what more can you ask for from a triple pack?
Office Space is a great movie for any working adult to enjoy, though it's rated R so not for your kids.
Dodgeball is funny and Ben Stiller makes it worth watching, this is Unrated but would probably get a PG-13 rating so older kids can watch I think.
Napoleon Dynamite is rated PG and my kids enjoyed it and I've seen it several times and it's still amusing.",1383091200,,473,4.266666666666667
8577912,5,B00C77VYA4,Three great movies for one low price!  There should be lots more of these triple features available instead of having to buy a box set.,1378684800,,135,4.4
