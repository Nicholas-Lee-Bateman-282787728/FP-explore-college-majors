7878837,5,6304877269,"The actual title is B@! $ to the wall, which is the perfect title for the best tape in the Golden Boy Series.  Every Golden Boy tape can be reduced to 3 acts (with the exception of #3). 1) The setup, 2) The Hijinks, and 3)  The closure where the girl learns a silly moral and realizes that Kintaro  was the ultimate stud and she's sorry he's gone now.  The third act is  almost always boring and in tape four was insufferable.  In tape Five, the  entire third act is reduced to 1 minute, and is quite amusing.  I spent the  entire last 15 minutes of this episode on the floor laughing my rear end  off.  In Tape Five, Kintaro meets a woman who REALLY loves her motorcycle,  if you catch my drift!  She claims that it's better than a man, and if a  man could beat her bike in a race, she'd give herself to him. Luckily,  Kintaro has his trusty Mikazuki 5, and accepts her challenge.  I won't blow  any more, but the race is not only exciting, but utterly hilarious! While  this is the most sexually explicit of the episodes (a plus to some people),  it's also the best.
