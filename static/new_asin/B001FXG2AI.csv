3589490,4,B001FXG2AI,I love this DVD.  The imagery with his songs are awesome!  I hope he produces many more!,1236988800,,88,4.117647058823529
3589491,3,B001FXG2AI,"I love Paul Hardcastle's music and have all of his (and the Jazzmaster's) CD's, so I was quite excited about this DVD release, however VISUALLY it is very disappointing. [...]. In an era of CGI and HD TV I thought that the video quality was terrible and that the content was terribly boring and self-indulgent.

On a technical note, I would have liked the option of a CD only ""bonus disc"" (this would have helped the other reviewer who couldn't get this DVD to work in a CD player - DOH !!!), as I would have liked to burn the music element of the DVD to my Sonance music server, so that I could listen to the DVD without having to put it into a player each time.

So, in conclusion, musically this disc is a 4, visually a 1 (at best).

Sorry Paul !!!!",1234915200,2,752,4.172413793103448
3589492,5,B001FXG2AI,"Please ignore and excuse the previous reviwer. They obviously do not know what they are talking about or the difference between a CD and A DVD.and have unfairly gave a poor review sipmly because they technologically challanged. This is a DVD and if you are a Paul Hardcastle fan you will love this. This is a VERY relaxing and imaginitive journey in to the world of Paul Hardcastles music. He puts visuilazations of space, lush tropical getaways, and other computer generated imagry to some of his best music yet. A long awaited request from his fans come to fruation and well worth the wait. If you are a fan of Paul Hardcastle and/or The Jazzmasters you do not want to miss this.. Highly reccomended.",1234396800,2,702,4.669354838709677

8302954,5,B001FXG2AI,"The Journey to a Different State of Mind was one of the best DVD's I have ever had.  I thought it was a CD where I could hear it in my car, but it clearly says ""DVD"" so I have to listen to it on my DVD player.  I love this DVD by Paul Hardcastle, it tells alot about us African Americans, something we should know about us, he's got it on this DVD, read between the words, listen to the music - AWESOME.",1376611200,,403,3.7857142857142856

8302958,5,B001FXG2AI,"this dvd consists of 11 sets containing images that are either fantastical, factual or just plain fun.  the music expertly underscores the themes which range from dreams to kings to dancing lights leading to an increased comprehension of our world.

if solo space travel does not attract you gather a group and purchase a copy of this dvd.  in a short time, each will find it a necessity to own their own.  amazon is the vehicle of your ""ticket to ride"".

two postscripts:

1.  be sure to press ""play"" in the beginning while the curtain is opening and closing.
2.  view the bonus material and gain an introduction to the personal paul hardcastle.",1347840000,,646,4.654867256637168

I hope he continues putting out the great music with his very distinctive style. I can't get enough of his music!!",1253577600,,278,4.770833333333333
