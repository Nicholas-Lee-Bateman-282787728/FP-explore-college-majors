8436048,4,B004MILYZG,"This disc took three weeks to arrive, did not arrive in original packaging, was tricky to open in Windows 10, but eventually I got it. I do like that it completes the set of accessories for my CoverPro 2000. The disc is geared for the 1000cpx, which was not mentioned or I did not notice it prior to buying, but Oh Well. The accessory feet fit both machines and the videos are great, so this was OK. I bought it because I want to complete my accessory package for my machines before I could not get it anymore. I guess Janome did not make one specific for the CoverPro 2000cpx, which is not Kens Sewing fault. I have bought from them before and would use them again. Glad it finally got here.",1475366400,,692,4.25
