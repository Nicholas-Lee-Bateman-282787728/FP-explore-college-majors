This tape includes six tales; The Tale of Peter Rabbit, The Tale of Two Bad Mice, The Tale of Tom Kitten, The Tale of Jeremy Fisher, The Tale of Benjamen Bunny and The Story of Miss Moppet.  Enjoy these tapes very much, and something sweet for the kids to watch.  Also includes eight nursery rhymes by Cecily Parsley.  Adorable and beautiful illustrations and wonderful narration.",1201392000,,445,4.8933333333333335
