8560460,5,B00B12SHOM,"This DVD sets out not to show one how to draw on a sheet of paper, but to show them the basics about symmetry, structure and layout. Russell is an artist who you can clearly see has his inspiration from the golden age of illustration. His layouts and the way he arranges not only the word balloons but also the white space on each sheet of illustration board is an art onto itself.
  If you are looking for a how to draw video this is not for you. However if you are looking for a video to help you layout your pages in a more beautiful and eye pleasing manor this video is for you. Russell goes through pages of his own creation and shows you the viewer why he laid them out as such. He shows such techniques as pacing, depth, and creating emotion and tension.
I highly suggest this video to help those out there wanting to take their comic book pages to the next level. This video just may be the difference of you getting on with a larger company or just sitting at your drawing table creating for your own pleasure.",1394409600,2,1019,4.220512820512821
8560461,1,B00B12SHOM,"As much as I love P. Craig Russell's work, this video is surely one of the most amateurish attempts I have ever wasted my money on. It looks like it is shot in a hallway using incandescent light and a cheap, slightly (just slightly) out of focus video camera.  The information presented seems to be off the cuff and not particularly well-rehearsed. Mr. Russell stands in front of an inked page, pointing to panels and making some general observations, with periodic cuts to close ups of the final printed page. This to me does not provide much insight into anything other than how NOT to make an instructional video. Mr. Russell, please make a video that demonstrates these concepts with you sitting at a drawing board with a pencil.",1388620800,,733,4.682170542635659
