4331522,4,B004D7GU32,"This is a great performance by Setzer. It lives up to the DVD's title. And audio & video quality should please all of the ""philes"" out there. Setzer is probably the best in the world at what he does. This show was about 1 1/2hrs. I'm not a Setzer fan. I bought this DVD to add something different to my collection of concert movies. For me, it was a bit repetitive after a while, hence the 4 stars. Many of the songs sound very similar...I'm not sure that I'll be re-watching this one too many times but there is one part though that I will...Not sure what he calls it but it sounds like ""The Flight of The Bumble-Bees"" - amazing! His band is very talented and seem to be having fun on here. They look a little better/stylish than what I have seen on some YouTube videos. They do still come off as very ""geeky"" to me. Just my opinion(sorry geeks)...He is one cool cat, his band ain't. Just some new glasses(Buddy Hollyish) on the upright bass player, for example, would change him from nerd to cool cat. The girls are okay, but even they could use an image enhancement. I don't know the whole story about this particular event, but I'm not so sure 150,000 people came to see this band, nor that there was that many people there while this was filmed. Having said that, I imagine any Setzer fan will love this DVD. The guy does rock!",1292198400,3,1332,4.3107569721115535
4331523,5,B004D7GU32,"I remember the Stray Cats and always REALLY liked them and thought they were good, but who ever would have expected then that Brian Setzer would go on to become one of the greatest guitarists that ever walked the earth?

Expecting to see just that, this show will not let you down. I have a lot of the Orchestra albums from the early days, 90's etc., and it seems he has continued to grow and gain strength as a bandleader. I really enjoyed the interplay of the guitar and the band, and loved to see the guitar in charge and how Brian had them following and anticipating his changes, solos, breaks, all of it. He's not a bad singer either.

The press conference was great to watch also. Makes me feel like saying, ""Next time you're in Chicago, let's hit a few clubs and check out some music."" I'm sure he would appreciate our home-grown blues music here in Chicago.

Anyways, thanks, Brian, all the orchestra, those singing/dancing chicks, and everyone who made this one possible. If you only buy one DVD of Brian Setzer and his Orchestra, this would be an excellent choice.",1291593600,7,1074,4.525773195876289
4331524,5,B004D7GU32,"You want something different from another loud hair band? No one puts a spin on classic 50's Rock like the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Tight and powerful, BSO rocks the hall like no other band today. This CD wil light up the living room and have you Jump, Jivin' and Wailin' in no time. You even get a taste of the old Stray Cats when the band takes a break and Brian rocks out some classics with the Slap Bass and Stand up Drums and his '59 Gretsch 6120 SSLVO. Put a classic spin on Party Night and invite Brian over and kick those 49 Mercury Blues!",1290816000,5,546,4.160377358490566

4331526,5,B004D7GU32,"This arrived via UPS today and I couldn't get it into the DVD player fast enough.  I have been to many (10+) of Brian Setzer's concerts and each time I become a bigger fan.  This performance rates towards the top of the list for me.  He is playing to over 100,000 screaming fans in the streets of Montreal and the energy is amazing.  Brian improvises the set as he goes and at one point stops the beginning of one song, and starts his orchestra down a different path simply by changing his guitar riff. (I'll let you discover other gems on your own)  The recording quality is very good.  I am watching it on a 55"" LCD and it looks pretty sharp.  Yes I wish it was available on Blu-ray format but I forgot about this problem after a few minutes.  The sound is excellent on my 5.1 surround, it definately makes me feel like I am there.  This DVD is a MUST OWN for any Setzer fan with a DVD player.",1288224000,10,895,4.156976744186046

4331538,5,B004D7GU32,"Fantastic concert! Great video and sound quality! I don't no what other people are talking about it having bad sound? Maybe they have bad surround sound systems or something. I get plenty of bass on my 12"" Polk sub and trumpets coming through on my full size towers. I didn't have to change any settings on my surround sound and I'm very picky when it comes to video and sound quality. Everything sounds nicely blended. Yes there doesn't seem to be a center channel but my towers do a great job! Also concerts truly are meant to be watched in 2.0 (if you have full range towers) or 2.1 with a good sub blended in. You don't have a band playing beside you and behind you when you go to a concert.",1417132800,,695,4.2727272727272725
4331539,5,B004D7GU32,"Well, this was a surprise. The best concert I have seen. Brian Setzer in Montreal. He said there was supposed to be three or four hundred people there. It turned out to be 150,000 for the outdoor concert. It is long, it is good, and no other person on the road can top this. The whole group is so good and it was discovered in 1995. The whole band is outstanding and the crowd wouldn't let him go. He and the band are the best entertainment on the road around the world. If you miss buying this DVD...you are sick. I don't understand how they can be so good for so long on the stage. Any other group would be worn out. I like them better than THE ROLLING STONES who are finally burned out and too old, to rock with anything new. Brian plays all kinds, country western, jazz, rock & roll of course, and has even added an orchestra behind them. And it worked. PERFECT CONCERT",1415664000,2,873,4.2023809523809526
4331540,3,B004D7GU32,"Brian Setzer is a guitar virtuoso who has revolutionised the Big Band sound with his writing and playing. This performance should have been an easy 5/5, however the sound of the Bass Guitar is virtually non existent. A huge disappointment. I tried reconfiguring my Audio setup in many ways but alas - NO BASS GUITAR!!
An amazing performance from Brian Setzer made me at least salute and enjoy his performance.",1412899200,2,409,4.857142857142857

A must have for a BSO fan or even just the casual jazz/swing/blues enthusiast!",1398902400,,285,4.916666666666667
4331544,4,B004D7GU32,The only thing that kept this from being a five star rating is the sound quality.  You have to turn the volume way up.  For a modern day blu-ray it should be way better.  Other than that it is an amazing show.  See him live if you can.  One of the truly great entertainers of our time.,1391817600,,285,3.9298245614035086

4331546,3,B004D7GU32,Bad luck the audio is lacking. It hardly got my sub working at all. Picture and concert quality is very good. Add better audio & this would have earned 5 stars,1390953600,,159,4.161290322580645
4331547,5,B004D7GU32,Setzer is great. I saw his Christmas Show a few years ago and it was so entertaining. Even the Ventures played in the show. Money well spent!,1387065600,,141,4.2592592592592595
4331548,5,B004D7GU32,"This show is just terrific (but aren't all Setzer's shows terrific?!?!)  The clarity of the video and sound is top shelf, and the energy of the show is unbeatable.  Whenever I attend one of his shows I am almost out of breath at the end, and this DVD radiates that energy.  I gave a copy of this to my best friend for a gift and when he played it during a New Year's Eve party he was having, his guests went crazy over how much they loved watching and listening to it.  Don't waste your time thinking about it, just buy it and play it, and then you'll want to play it again right away (if you're not out of breath)!",1385683200,2,615,4.0578512396694215
4331549,2,B004D7GU32,A little too much Brian and somehow my copy is in 5.0 not 5.1 it's lost all of its bass. Commerce is 5.1 but the Onkyo decoder says 5.0 and it sure sounds as if the sub woofer has been turned off.,1383696000,,196,3.6904761904761907

4331559,2,B004D7GU32,"I have to agree with some reviewers that the video on this disc is excellent.  Also, the show is excellent.  But where was the recording engineer? Blu-Ray format offers sound that will ""blow-your-socks-off"". This DVD does not. Bass is very subdued as are the horns. Sounds like TV sound. The reviewer who said that those of us with premium sound systems are more interested in our systems than in the performance has it half-right. We demand the sound we paid for, especially with the Blu-Ray format!  I won't be purchasing Surf Dog products in the future.",1306368000,5,556,4.770833333333333

4331561,5,B004D7GU32,"So...this doesn't have the ""state of the art"" sound....its still sounds great and the picture quality is fabulous and OH lets not forget in all the technical crying and whining....Brian and his group tore that stage apart with about 2 hours of fabulous music!  I can't even PARK at a concert for the price of this Blu-Ray and this is a fabulous show...unless you are a tech nerd who cares more for their speaker system than the music itself you will be delighted with this show. By the way...its NOT horrible sound or awful sound...its just not the maximum the format can provide....

It is nearly a 2 hour show...filmed well, played well...the big band is terrific, Brian breaks down the show part way to go to bass drums guitar lineup ala Stray Cats for several songs so the dynamics are fun...and the hits are well spaced to really add drama to the show. The bonus 20 minute press conference is also a fun bonus feature.",1304380800,5,923,4.554216867469879
4331562,5,B004D7GU32,"This DVD is great! Perfect sound quality and a great BSO show. (Maybe even one of the best ever!).

Also enjoyed watching the extra's, like the pre-show interview/press conference.

If you're a Setzer fan, you gotta have this for sure!
If you like good music, just order it, you'll love it!",1304035200,,290,4.666666666666667
4331563,4,B004D7GU32,"I own 4 BSO DVDs. Brian is an awesome, tasteful, talented guitarist!

This is a must own for all BS and BSO fans.

Has anyone else noticed a considerable lack of source volume in 5.1 mode? - or is it just my copy? I have to crank it 10-15 db higher than any other DVD or DVD-A.

Also, the only sound in the rear speakers is fan applause.

Feedback from other owners on the volume/5.1 sound issue is appreciated.",1298419200,3,411,4.1645569620253164
4331564,3,B004D7GU32,"I'd read a review on this Blu-Ray edition that I mostly agree with. The 1080p transfer is more than adequate, but the audio is only Dolby 5.0(that's right 5.0 not even 5.1), nor is it Dolby True HD. The soundmix is clear and ambient even with the limited bandwith. The performance is amazing, but BSO rarely dissapoints. The Amazon price is fair for a Blu-Ray of this level, but a DVD edition would hardly be much different. For the price I'd still recomend the Blu-Ray just for the video quality.",1296259200,2,497,4.533333333333333
4331565,3,B004D7GU32,"I enjoyed the performance of the band on this blu-ray, but as mentioned by the other reviewers, the audio on this is not quite up to todays standards.  Keeping things in perspective, before the advent of blu-ray and it's lossless codecs, I probably would have thought this disc sounded good, even great. But, once you've been treated to some nice lossless concert or movie soundtracks, you can appreciate the difference.

The real rub for me is that the audio isn't a 5.1 track, the menu says 5.1, but once playing the disc, my Onkyo receiver reports 5.0 on the on screen display. Ok, I say, so no LFE, it's a concert, so really, no biggie, the bass is mixed in the main channels, and the crossover in the AVR will direct that to the subs. So, I'm grooving along with my subwoofer setting set +5 from normal to get some audible bass out of this when I realize, there is no center channel audio... for the entire concert! So, essentially what you have is a stereo mix, with a little applause and ambience thown in the surround channels. It's a 4 channel track. It is what it is...

Do I regret that I bought this? Nope.  It's a fun concert, a solid performance. If the audio were improved on this, I'd consider this a 4 star concert.",1295568000,6,1232,4.41409691629956
4331566,5,B004D7GU32,"The production values(audio/video) are excellent and state of the art. I'd say as good as any U2 concert DVD. And that's saying something because they spare no expense to give the viewer and listener the best possible experience for the money. And neither did Brian's team on this DVD.

For the guitar players:
Brian Setzer is simply the best, most popular guitarist on the planet in this idiom. In his element, he's comparable to Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, et al. One of a kind. You just know it's him. Using just his basic rig of Gretch guitars, tape loop echo effect and a single Fender Bassman amp, cranked to the max, he nails every single solo. Every one. Loud, clean, not a note out of place with a dynamic pick attack. His inversions and moving chord work is amazing, and very rarely repeats himself. The icing is the vibrato work, using it to great effect; it doesn't get any better than this folks.

Carl Perkins, Les Paul, and Danny Gatton all rolled into one. On '16 Chicks' and ""Fishnet Stockings"" he plays so hard and intense, I thought I'd never say it but...he plays better than Danny Gatton.

Finally, the Drummer. Tony Pia. His performance is a master class of drumming. Whether he's on the 'cocktail set' or the full double bass kit, he's the best musician, next to Setzer, in the band. He drives and elevates every arrangement.

Put this one on the very best audio/video system you or a friend has, turn it up, sit back and enjoy!

Very Highly Recommended.",1294099200,13,1474,4.5893536121673
4331567,4,B004D7GU32,Ok so this is the first blu-ray for Brian Setzer. They made a huge mistake by not including high resolution audio. Yes I was disappointed like the other two reviewers here but there is NO WAY you can say this one sucks or is terrible or don't buy. The concert was incredible and the sound is by no means terrible.  Next time Brian- HIGH RESOLUTION AUDIO --DTS HD Master Audio PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!!,1293667200,14,415,4.533333333333333
