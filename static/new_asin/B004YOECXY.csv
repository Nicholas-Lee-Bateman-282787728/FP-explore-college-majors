8448636,3,B004YOECXY,"For the first time I saw two Fatty Arbuckle comedies on TCM, both with Buster Keaton in a supporting role. Both were very funny so I ordered this DVD. There are four short films on this DVD. I didn't find them funny at all. Didn't give me a single laugh. The picture quality & music at least are both good. I should, I guess, try a different set of Arbuckle films but I was so disappointed in these that I think I'm done.",1509321600,,421,4.0843373493975905
8448637,5,B004YOECXY,Fatty Arbuckle was a comedy legend and these 4 shorts say it all with their slapstick antics. Very entertaining and fun to watch.,1505347200,,129,4.6521739130434785

8448639,5,B004YOECXY,"I love the classics! So does my pawpaw, of course! So I ordered this so we could watch together..... We had a blast! You get exactly what is stated on this page.... If you are a collector and looking for more, this is not anything more than what it claims to be.
We have prime, came in super fast of course. Worked perfectly. Not damaged. Good price! I need to find the DVD where Fatty is a golf caddy! We really want to see that again!",1463356800,,436,4.0813953488372094
8448640,4,B004YOECXY,"Well any time I can get a few silent comedies (4) is good day. The first one of this set I've never seen before(Fatty and Minnie He-Haw 1918) Interesting with real native Girl being used in what appears to be a real Indian village with even more real natives...rather unusual.

 I guess this is Typical for these old movies. You get a set then buy another set from another company of the same charachter  and find you have several of them repeated. The other three I've seen but offhand to be fair, don't know if they are on other CD's I have or on tape.

All four movies have the actors using almost sign language to convey thoughts(to reduce dialogue boxes) and are not particularily inovative in thier usage. Mabel Normand is usualy the worst for this sort of hand movement acting...though I didn't notice her doing it as much.

Generally speaking average fair for slapstick comedy...with a few laughs. Thankfully back then they weren't using laugh tracks.

The box-case speil on Spooning Days, is typical of current day thought patterns shoved and forced on vintage comedy which is often far more blithe and innocent than moderns like to pretend they are.

The film quality is about average or a bit above average for the period(1913-1918), and there doesn't seem to be any lost footage except for the odd clipped bit here and there.

My disc seems to have a glitch so when I came back to watch the second movie I had to fast forward through the first. But was able to see the third or fourth without having to fast forward through the others.

Anyway it's nice to have four Fatty's on one disc. running time is 55 minutes. The dialogue cards are original but they do overlap them on a couple occasions with things like ""The end"" and copyrights , but for the most part original. Frankly I prefer them to leave them well enough alone in their original state and any tweaking is bad, even if it clarifies, because then it's no longer a completely period peice. There are no bothersome company logos burned on the movie,except maybe at the very beggining for a few seconds.",1385424000,,2074,4.583783783783784
8448641,5,B004YOECXY,"This is a little set,but for a Roscoe's fan like me,it's as important to adding it on my collection as ""The forgotten films of Roscoe fatty Arbuckle""-set because we would like to have a lot of his films to find,but it isn't possible because Roscoe had too short time to make more movies with his free soul. The only thing we can do is protect him and everything he has left to us. Thank you Roscoe,and I'm sorry but I couldn't to be there when you were so alone to fight against ignorance,dirty managers and craven ""friends""...I was born later...but with dvd like this...I don't forget!!!And I laugh...I laugh..I laugh against the ignorance,dirty managers and craven ""friends"" until tears fill my eyes.malefica from Italy.",1351209600,3,722,4.830645161290323
