8319127,4,B001LNOLK0,"""The Night Child"" was Massimo Dallamano's 1975 thriller and somewhere after directing some superior films (he was cinematographer for many films including Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More"") like ""A Black Veil for Lisa"" (1969) and ""What Have You Done to Solange?"" (1972) he kind of became less outstanding.  Just prior to ""The Night Child"" he directed ""Superbitch,"" not a giallo, but a crimesploitation film that was a bit ragged artistically.  ""The Night Child"" is a three star occult/thriller for which Dallamano more than anythings extracts interesting performances from a talented cast including Richard Johnson (The Witch In Love"" and ""The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders""),  Lila Kedrova (""Torn Curtain"", ""Zorba the Greek""), Joanna Cassidy (""Blade Runner""), Edmund Purdom in an extremely small role, the talented child actress,, Nicole Elmi (""Who Saw Her Die?"") and  Evelyn Stewart (""Assassination"" and many others), but the story by Franco Marotta, Massimo Dallamano and Laura Toscano is underdeveloped and silly at times. The music score is extremely good by Stelvio Cipriani, perhaps a bit repetitious  When I watched the first disc in this two disc ""special edition"" from Sinister Cinema, I thought well,  Sinister Cinema has just provided us another washed color mediocre European film in English that must have been made from a VHS as their was distinctly old tracking problems at one point.  But when I watched the second disc, the ""European cut"" I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful color and crisp images of the immaculate transfer they provided of the film in Italian with English subtitles.  And for the still low price offered on amazon.  The Code Red edition is probably a way to scalp people as the film is not worth $60.00.  Kudos to Sinister Cinema.  I am usually willing to overlook some of their drawbacks as they, I think, have over and again done the best they can with what they have to work.",1402099200,6,1962,5.062111801242236
8319128,3,B001LNOLK0,"Michael Williams, who works for BBC, finds a somehow impressive Italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled DIABOLICAL ART: A DOCUMENTARY. But since his wife's mysterious death her daughter, Emily, has been emotionally disturbed, so he goes Spoleto, where the problematic picture is, with her and her nanny, Jill. And there is a Countess, who is also a psychic, and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named Emilia was executed.

This Italian film is, of course, almost innocently influenced by THE EXORCIST, but this one is much cheaper, much simpler, and in a sense, much dirtier.

First of all, it should be said this film is full of confusion. To make matters worse, this film also has characteristic problem (if not confusion); every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human. Regarding Emily (or Emilia), she is after all a child, and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness.

In addition, special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable. Although Stelvio Cipriani's music is noteworthy, beautiful (indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone), the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap B-film which can disappoint even the 1970s'-Italian- horror-film-lovers.",1386115200,4,1369,4.943478260869565
8319129,5,B001LNOLK0,"Possessed into the darkest kind of evil! Beyond the Door of Madness Lies the ""NIGHT CHILD""! This Italian Giallo (Giallo means Yellow in Italian. Everybody knows what Giallo translated into English is if they know what Giallo films are.), is one of my favorite Giallo movies ever made! The thing I like about this DVD-R release is that it comes with the original Italian version with English subtitles and the English dub on 2 discs! The Italian version is in 2.35:1 widescreen and the English dub is in 1.35:1 widescreen. The movie is about Emily (Nicole Elmi, Who Saw Her Die?), that gets a titular medallion as a gift by her father (Richard Johnson, Beyond The Door). Once it's on her neck, she get's possessed into the darkest kind of evil (like I said) by a spirit of a dead child that was very evil and satanic! People get victimized by ""The Night Child"" because they don't even watch out! Great film and great DVD-R release! And the other thing I like about the DVD-R release is that it comes with the American poster! *****! This film reminds me of the film called ""The Possession"" from 2012 starring Jeffrey Dean Morgen because the little girl in this classic old-school horror film from 1976 and ""The Possession"" gets something and gets possessed by an evil satanic spirit and plus, both of their names are Emily! Who cool is that? My favorite version of ""The Night Child"" is the Italian version with the English subtitles. This film is also known as Il Medaglione Insanguinato (The Cursed Medallion), Il Medaglione Insanguinato-Perche? (The Cursed Medallion-Why?), El Medallon Ensangrentado (The Bloodied Medallion), Emilie: L'enfant Des Tenebres (Emilie, The Child Of Darkness), The Cursed Medallion, and Together Forever. Buy the Sinster Cinema DVD-R version of this film for $8.99 on www.amazon.com.",1373414400,3,1812,4.944262295081967
