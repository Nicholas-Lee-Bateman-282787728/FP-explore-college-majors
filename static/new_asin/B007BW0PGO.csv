My daughter and I are great fans of the series of classic manga books by Tezuka, so I was looking forward to this film. I am greatly disappointed.

Gone is the wonderful humour of the manga. There is no trace either of the wonderful distinctive style of Tezuka's drawings... this looks just like a thousand other bland anime movies. This is a movie which takes itself far too seriously. The Hollywood-style music is all sentimental swells and saccharine excess.

If you enjoyed the deep aspects of the mangas' introduction to the life of the Buddha and to Buddhist teaching... if you enjoyed the original quirky fun and great simple storytelling of the books - then avoid this film like the plague!!

Luckily the books are still available in English translation and are a great read for child and adult alike. Go for it!",1346284800,3,946,4.680722891566265
