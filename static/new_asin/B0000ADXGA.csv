1905273,5,B0000ADXGA,"The Doctor (Jon Pertwee) is now working hand-in-hand with Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and UNIT. So he's on the scene when the Brigadier investigates why the astronauts on Mars Probe 7 have not communicated with Space Control since they started the trip back to Earth seven months before. Professor Ralph Cornish, head of the program, sent a recovery space capsule to investigate, and now they're having the same problem with the rescue mission.

When, finally, the rescue mission lands on Earth, the three astronauts in it are kidnapped in a daring raid. Not only that, but scientist Liz Shaw notices that the Geiger counter is showing maximum radiation. What is going on? Who has kidnapped the astronauts, if indeed, these creatures able to kill with a touch are actually our astronauts.

This episode sends delicious shivers up my spine. I think it does an excellent job of stringing the viewer along, trying to figure out what is happening and why. As the Doctor says, ""I don't know what came down in Recovery 7, but it certainly wasn't human!""  I appreciate the general theme of the dangers of xenophbia. I also get a kick out of Liz Shaw's white go-go boots. I had a pair myself in sixth grade.

This review is for the October, 2012, release of ""Ambassadors of Death"" on DVD, the first time it will be offered on DVD. There are seven 25-minute episodes. This longer format is not always appreciated - there's more time for character development and conversation, which isn't to everybody's preference.

The show first aired in March - May, 1970. It sounds like there's good reasons why it's taken this long to get out on DVD. The show was originally filmed on color videotape, but several of the seven episodes were only stored on black & white 16mm film. With new technology, they are ""picking"" the color out of the film. The DVD release is in full color for all episodes. I wonder if that will change the shiver factor for me. The scene where a kidnapped alien astronaut trudges out of it's room like Frankenstein, to mount the stairs while one of its captors cowers against the door, looks pretty awesome in grainy black & white. [After watching my DVD, I think it holds up pretty well in color!]

This will be a 2-disc release. The only extra on Disc 1 is the Commentary. The other extras are on Disc 2. After my DVD was received and watched, I've added to my description of these extras:

1.  Commentary. Parts of it were recorded in 2009. Participants include Caroline John (who plays Liz Shaw), Nicholas Courtney (Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart), Michael Ferguson (director), Peter Halliday (the voice behind multiple alien voices, though he has acted in previous Dr. Who series), Derek Ware (stunt co-ordinator and a UNIT sargeant), Roy Scammell (stuntman), Derek Martin (stuntman), Jeffrey Deavers (Private Johnson, and Caroline John's real-life husband) and Terrance Dicks (script editor and ""part author""). Caroline John just passed away in June, 2012, at the age of 71. Nicholas Courtney died in February 2011.
Toby Hadoke is the Commentary moderator, and he is really growing on me. He obviously researches the series and the commentators beforehand.
At the beginning of episode 1, the Doctor and Liz disappear and re-appear as he works to fix the TARDIS time vector generator (and can escape his exile on Earth). The main purpose of this scene was to get something sci-fi into the story early on, at the request of Barry Letts, the producer. Dicks says, ""Barry used to say ... 'We need something Who-ish to happen!' ""
The commentators talk about Who companions. Playing second string to the Doctor wasn't always easy. Dicks explains, ""The reason why Barry wanted to ... change Carrie [Caroline as Liz] was because ... the character was too intelligent! ... There was no excuse for the Doctor to explain things"".
You need to listen to the commentary for Episode 2, with all the stuntmen, to find out to what ""Sign the blood chit"" refers!
2.  ""Mars Probe 7: Making The Ambassadors of Death"" (27 minutes) Commentators include Terrance Dicks, Michael Ferguson, Derek Ware, Roy Scammell and Margot Hayhoe (assistant floor manager). At one point, Margot mentions how all the stuntmen were very attractive, and the videos that are shown of rehearsals, etc., certainly bear this out.
3.  TV trailer for ""The Ambassadors of Death"" (1.5 minutes)
4.  ""Tomorrow's Times: The Third Doctor"" (13.5 minutes) Narrated by Peter Purves, this special goes to the archives of the British Library to see what newspapers were printing about Jon Pertwee's Doctor. One columnist wrote that Pertwee ""manages to look like Danny Kaye while sounding like Boris Karloff.""
Pertwee started as a whole new Doctor in 1970, which also ushered in full color for Doctor Who. In addition, BBC wanted the show to have a grittier feel to it. In spite of the lack of graphic blood and gore, there were still many complaints that Pertwee's Dr. Who was too violent, especially as it's time-slot was late afternoon, when very young children were more likely to watch the show. But, as Pertwee said in an interview, ""Rubbish! Our programme isn't violent, it's all just fantasy. There is no blood, no pain - it wouldn't upset an eighty-year-old maiden aunt and my young son loves it.""

7.  Coming Soon TV trailer for ""Claws of Axos"". This is a great one, with fading in and out in black and tight cuts, the trailer is scarier than the series itself!

1905274,5,B0000ADXGA,"As my title states, anytime a new vintage Dr. Who video becomes available I rush out to get it.  I love vintage Dr. Who and I love this video, too!!",1123286400,2,148,3.933333333333333
1905275,4,B0000ADXGA,"VHS... How quaint.

I've never really understood the bad rap that AMBASSADORS OF DEATH gets. Sure, it's in the middle of a good season, but I've never felt it was the weakest of Pertwee's first year. I'd much rather watch this again than view THE SILURIANS (I like the idea of SILURIANS much more than the actual story itself). AMBASSADORS is a straightforward romp that I found very enjoyable. When my copy arrived, I planned to watch the first tape one night, saving the second for the next evening. But I was having such a blast, I viewed the whole thing in one long sitting.

A lot of the time we fans find ourselves laughing at the show as often as we laugh with it. Time has not always been kind, and aspects of this serial show their age. Television and film were still new to the idea of portraying space travel realistically; it's amusing to see the production crew simulating weightlessness by turning the camera upside-down and running everything in slowmo. Gender equality is also something that the producers may have attempted, but, amusingly, Britain's Space Control Centre is staffed by a substantial number of pouting, miniskirted scientist-babes.

The story begins with the British Space Programme (well, it was the early 70s, and they were rather optimistic back then) mounting a rescue mission to discover what happened to their latest Mars Probe. When the capsule docks, contact is lost while a loud alien sound screams across the radio. The Doctor believes the sound is an alien message. Some time later, mysterious space-suited figures that can kill by touch are seen committing petty thefts, stealing radioactive isotopes and scientific equipment.

My review is more a series of isolated thoughts. This is an entertaining romp, and deep, serious analysis wouldn't be particularly fruitful. My initial thought is that this is probably the story where the James Bond influence on the Pertwee era is the most apparent. The Doctor pulls gadgets from nowhere. He faces an earthbound menace with access to the latest military hardware. Gun-battles and chase scenes abound. There are even jazzy musical cues to punctuate the action.

On the subject of the music, I just want to say that I really dig the incidental score, occasionally inappropriate as it is (to me, action sequences don't scream out for flute solos). Of particular note is the piece played whenever the Ambassadors initiate their raids. Dreamy and atmospheric, I loved it the first time; multiple viewings have not diminished my appreciation.

Action by Havoc! Yes, the stunt-work in this one is impressive. AMBASSADORS relies on its action sequences and the team is more than up to the challenge. The battles are smoothly executed and sharply directed. Something that I found amusing (and I'm probably alone) is that one of the stuntmen reminded me of Stan Laurel. This presented me with very entertaining imagery. Stan Laurel shooting bad guys. Stan Laurel's rifle shot from his hands. Stan Laurel thrown from a helicopter. I guess life after Hardy was rough on the little guy.

The script contains quite a number of nice little moments. Reegan is particularly villainous, casually ordering his two lackeys to their deaths and then attending to the disposal of their bodies.

Visually, the story is strong. The blank faces of the space-suited aliens are as chilling as any other villain Doctor Who would produce. It's an effective way of highlighting the alien's fundamental otherness by placing the unfamiliar inside the familiar. Removing the face completely dehumanizes the aliens. It's a much more effective way of displaying their unsettling nature than if they had relied on cheap makeup.

The film sequences are fantastic -- a world of difference from the rather static studio portions. The shot of the Ambassador slowing walking towards the UNIT guard with the sun behind him would look at home in a smooth, atmospheric movie. Even the chase-scenes are inspired; note that stylish shot where Reegan races through metal walkways. He steps briefly into a puddle and the camera focuses on the reflection in the water as the ripples soften, allowing us to continue to see his progress. Cool stuff and not what one expects in a three-decade-old television production.

Towards the end, I was struck by the thought that the cliffhangers seemed unimaginative. Rather than having the episode build towards them, they just seemed to happen at whatever point in the story was up after twenty-five minutes. Wouldn't it have made more sense to move the episode five cliffhanger a few minutes so that it occurred as the alien spacecraft appears to smash the two capsules, rather than when the ship has merely appeared on the scanner?

In the later episodes, the story begins dragging. Liz gets very little to do, and her escape attempt adds nothing but time. The aliens are poorly realized outside their spacesuits. When the Ambassador removes his helmet, the director very wisely keeps the shots to a minimum, only showing the face either for a few moments, or from behind foggy glass. Unfortunately, he doesn't employ the same subtlety for the leader on the mothership, so we're treated to the sight of an alien made of oatmeal waving oven mitts at Jon Pertwee from behind a Venetian blind.

The restoration on the video is excellent. It's a pity that there was no alternative to fading between monochrome and color footage, but the transitions aren't especially jarring. The demonstration placed at the end of the second VHS tape really drives home how superior the cleaned up version is.

There's a funny cheat in episode seven where Cornish explains that they can't obtain a good look at the alien spacecraft because radioactivity is blotting out cameras. That'll save a bit of money from the effects budget! But I have to forgive AMBASSADORS its cheats because it's just so damned entertaining. And while there are figures of power in the world willing to launch pre-emptive military strikes, this story will always be relevant.",1096156800,21,6015,5.003
1905276,4,B0000ADXGA,"""I don't know what we brought down in Mars Probe 7, but it certainly was not human.""  That's the Doctor's assessment of three missing astronauts who were sent up in space, two of who were trasnmitting photos before radio contact was lost and were missing for seven months, and the other who was sent to find the first two.  In this 2001-Space Odyssey meets ""Invaders From Mars"" meets James Bond story, which deals with the implications of the first human contact with space aliens, Recovery 7, the rescue craft, is eventually brought down, with the astronauts missing.
The Doctor later discovers a high radiation reading from the capsule, which indicates that the astronauts should've been dead, but upon further investigation, finds a log discovering a 2 million rad count, leading him to make the opening quote of my review.  His attempts to find the astronauts is met with delay, espionage, sabotage, coverups, a hijacking which the Doctor foils in a very clever way, astonishing the Brigadier, and eventually, murder, in the Space Centre.  As the story progresses, more people are discovered to be part of the conspiracy, be it ordinary thugs, scientists, and even politicians.
Apart from UNIT, the only person who seems to accept his help is Dr. Cornish, the head of the Space Centre.  Then there's General Carrington, head of the military Security Service, whose motives from the get-go are very suspect, even though he tells the Doctor that the astronauts were suffering from a self-sustaining, highly contagious radiation, and he had national security in his interest.  However, the concept of moral duty comes into question, as depending on one's frame of mind, moral duty can mean whatever one wants it to mean.
Episode 5 features the first appearance of John Levene (Sergeant Benton) in the Pertwee era, having made his appearance in The Invasion (1968).  Caroline John is still great as Liz, but I doubt if real Cambridge Ph D graduates wear miniskirts that short.  Two Who guest star alumni include John Abineri (Carrington) later to come out in Death Of The Daleks (1974), and Cyril (Dr. Lennox), Viner in Tomb Of The Cybermen (1967), Dr. Clegg in Planet Of The Spiders (1974), and the Archimandrite in The Androids Of Tara (1978).  Michael Wisher (John Wakefield) came out in many Who stories, including Davros (Genesis Of The Daleks).
The times play a big part in this story.  The image of the Recovery 7 probe docking with the Mars Probe not only brings reminders of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) but also David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" (1969).  I half-expected to hear ""Ground control to Major Tom.""  And John Wakefield's TV narration gives a sense of the impact of TV, as this story was made a year after the first landing on the moon.
Before episode 1, there is the original trailer that was shown on BBC1 for this story.  While this is playing, a message scrolling at the bottom explains that although made in colour, only Episode 1 was maintained in its original form--the other copies being accidentally junked in colour, survived as b&w film recordings, with incomplete colour recordings recovered from the U.S. in order to restore the story to colour.  Hence there is a mix of colour and b&w, and as the brightness in restored segments plays havoc with the image's visibility, one can see the decision to leave 81 of its 171 minutes in b&w.  So, here's a rundown:
Episode 1-all in original colour
Episode 2-first few minutes in colour, then b&w all the way
Episode 3-about 10 minutes in colour, rest b&w
Episode 4-all in b&w
Episode 5-restored colour
Episode 6-b&w for few minutes, colour for couple minutes, b&w for couple minutes, colour for rest
Episode 7-first third in colour, second third in b&w, last third in colour
Yes, it may be an episode too long and contains some continuity errors, but what carries this story is the espionage and suspense, especially as the action goes into a continuous plot W, the Doctor gains the upper hand, only to end up one step behind when someone with information is killed or goes missing, and etc.  This is one of those thoughtful stories that requires repeated viewings on a lazy weekend.",1067472000,6,4155,4.872340425531915
1905277,5,B0000ADXGA,"First of all for those who keep saying 'why isn't this on DVD?' be patient!!!! those of us who have been collecting Doctor who videos since the early 90's needed to complete our collections, which is why the BBC is releasing all the remaining stories on video ( I bought the End of the Universe collection of course).
I've always felt very strongly that the early Pertwee (3rd Doctor) adventures were the very best that Dr. Who has to offer. They had the best writers, the best production values, and the cast with the Brigadeer and UNIT was superb and as Jon Pertwee often remarked, it is somewhat more terrifing when the menace comes to earth.
the plot is classic doctor who for the time, with the storyline revolving around a misunderstanding and humans who are usually the bad guys in the end. It is hard to belive that this one is one of the last videos to be released, but I'm glad it's finally here!!!!!",1066608000,9,910,4.4879518072289155
1905278,5,B0000ADXGA,"First off unlike what is mentioned in the editorial review, UNIT is not really depicted as the world's most inept security force, as part of the plot is that UNIT is being hampered by someone within the military.  This is an enjoyable story with many twists and turns.  This story trully shows Pertwee excelling as an action hero in contrast to his predecessors.  Ronald Allen, Nicholas Courtney, Caroline John, and the late John Abineri all give remarkable performances.",1062547200,,471,5.012820512820513

Well, I watched it again this year and was blown away at how cool this adventure was! It was very well done and one of the best Pertwee episodes I'd seen, maybe the best of that first season of Pertwee's.

1905290,5,B0000ADXGA,"This is a classic Doctor Who with all of the expected frills. Of course, this is the Jon Pertwee era. Here our Doctor is still bound to earth as a punishment for past crimes as a timelord when he was still Patrick Troughton. But, that takes nothing from the story. It's a great story with a companion we don't see enough of: Liz Shaw! Sorry, fans of Katy Manning, she is not in this one. But, Liz Shaw does a wonderful job in this classic story. There is a little bit of time travel in this story, but only a few seconds into the future and that is just a taste at the beginning and really has nothing to do with the show. The doctor gets involved in a mystery that sends him into outer space in a spaceship/rocket from earth. Where he finds many answers to questions posed during the show. I won't give any spoilers, but I will say that this is an edge of your seat story, that kept me watching chapter after chapter with no breaks. Unusual for me, as I usually watch a chapter, then get some food or something, but with this story, I did not want to wait to see what happened next.  If you like Jon Pertwee, and you like Doctor Who, this is a good show. Buy it. If you don't like Doctor Who, why are your reading this? Go out, find something to do, other than read about shows you don't like. That's it, that's a good chap.

1905291,4,B0000ADXGA,"""THE AMBASSADORS OF DEATH"" (STORY No. 53) was JON PERTWEE'S third go as THE DOCTOR. It rates about 4.25 stars (B/B+ range)

When something goes terribly wrong with the return of two British astronauts returning from Mars on MARS PROBE 7, a rescue ship, RECOVERY 7, piloted by a third astronaut is also ""lost"". Just as THE DOCTOR, LIZ SHAW and UNIT become involved, the capsule returns to Earth, apparently containing the three astronauts....

The capsule, however, is hijacked, then hijacked back by THE DOCTOR, but, before it can be opened by the Brigadier and THE DOCTOR, phony UNIT guards hijack the astronauts. It turns out that the ""astronauts"" are really radioactive aliens who have come seeking peaceful relations with Earth, but who are kidnapped by ""evil forces"" bent on using them for.....well.....evil purposes.....

THE DOCTOR eventually boards another rescue rocket to bring the REAL astronauts home, but finds that they are being held by the aliens until their own people are returned to them. The real astronauts have been brainwashed into thinking they are on Earth in quarantine and just watching football on television (say..this review is appropriately posted during the World Cup).

THE DOCTOR's mission now is to rescue the aliens and stop the plot before war ensues....

There are plenty of action sequences, stunts, plot twists, maybe TOO many ""moles"" in the military, the space program and the government, but despite typical 'padding' of the story (it could easily have been done in 5 episodes rather than 7), it is overall a good story and well acted.

Originally written by, and full credit given to, David Whitaker. Whitaker originally wrote the story in 1968, but his story was sent back for re-writes 3 times before it was totally rejected. It was brought out of mothballs 2 years later and re-worked by Terrence Dicks, Malcolm Hulke and Trevor Ray, although none were given screen credit.",1404777600,,1919,5.037854889589905
1905292,5,B0000ADXGA,I rated this story five stars because it show how resourceful the doctor can be when he does not have his tadris at his side.  He uses a standard spaceship to rescue the humans in space and a force field to trap the bad guys around his car.  I also like how far back the doctor has come from the old days dealing with aliens up to the present. I would recommend this story to all people.  It is a great look back to how to make a very good science fiction story.,1403568000,,462,3.946236559139785
1905293,5,B0000ADXGA,"Despite the unavoidable flaws in the restoration process, I'm so glad that it's been restored to a decent picture. This is a long story and very intense, so there is little boredom factor. I like it better now than when I first saw it.",1403395200,,235,4.363636363636363
1905294,5,B0000ADXGA,will enjoy watching this movie with my children for a long time to come. I am a long time doctor who fan and have my children interested in it also.,1393286400,,148,3.966666666666667

1905296,5,B0000ADXGA,"Doctor Whos 1970 season is perhaps better remembered for stories such as The Silurians with its moral ambiguity and Infernos journey into a parallel universe. Yet between those two stories is a forgotten little gem dealing with astronauts, manipulation and the threat of interstellar war. A story called The Ambassadors of Death.

The story can be seen an alien invasion take on The Silurians. Both stories have similar beginnings with UNIT helping out a UK scientific establishment which brings the Doctor and Liz into a crisis. Both stories have scientists in the establishment being involved with the aliens at the heart of the crisis and the Doctor finds himself caught in the middle while trying to prevent an all-out war. There are two things though that separates Ambassadors from its immediate predecessor.

What separates this story from its immediate predecessor is the action packed nature of the story. While Silurians very much limited itself to the scientific center, the caves and immediate area around it for the most part there is no such constraint on this story.  Locations change frequently throughout all seven episodes, helping to give the story enough scope to make it not only stretch across them but never be boring. It also features a large number of action sequences. These include battles between UNIT personnel and the forces of the antagonist (in episodes one, two and seven respectively), a car chase in episode three, numerous attacks by the aliens and even the Doctor being launched into space in the one time the Doctor left Earth this season. The result is perhaps the most action packed story of the season.

Something more profound also separates this story from Silurians as well: the motive of the story's antagonist. While Silurians was centered around egos and power plays by various characters which caused the situation to get worse, this story centers around one man and the perceived threat of an alien invasion. Ambassadors is ultimately a story about manipulation and the dangers of doing so to fit a preconceived agenda. As pointed out on the audio commentary, it's a message still relevant more than four decades after the story first aired.

The DVD presentation of the story is just as strong as the story. The DVD presents the story for the first time in full color since the 1970s and improves upon the VHS release a decade ago that partially restored the story. Due to the quality of the original source material, there is are some slight changes in quality between some of the episodes and indeed at a couple of points within episodes themselves but the overall quality of the color restoration more than makes up for the occasional fault. There's a wealth of expected special features including an audio commentary moderated by the ever excellent Toby Hadoke (and which also features Nicholas Courtney and Caroline John, neither of whom are sadly with us to see the show's fiftieth anniversary), an info text subtitle commentary and a well produced making of documentary that looks at the story's difficult development and production. All of which helps to make the DVD release all the better.

While less remembered than the stories its sandwiched between, The Ambassadors of Death holds up very well indeed. Its well paced across seven episodes, features plenty of action sequences, yet also looks at the dangers of a misplaced sense of duty in an ever changing world. This story then, rather than Silurians or Inferno, perhaps serves better as the template for the seasons that were to follow: action/adventure stories that were also dealing with bigger issues as well. Rarely would it be done better.",1385164800,,3660,5.011513157894737
1905297,5,B0000ADXGA,"A good John Pertwee Doctor Who episode. We enjoyed the basic story of ""something"" coming back in a space vessel sent out for exploration which is ""other"" than the astronauts that were sent out.",1368835200,,193,4.705882352941177

1905299,3,B0000ADXGA,"I really love this Doctor and he is one of my favorite Doctors, but this is not one of his best stories he has done.  The story line of this adventure, without giving anything away, was unnecessarily drawn out into extra episodes when it truly did not need to be.

Unlike episodes that were very lengthy, such as Planet of the Spiders, which needed many episodes to cover the very involved story line, sometimes they just need to be cut a bit shorter for those watching, especially when adventure content is not being heavily utilized.  In a nutshell I would say the episode is worth watching, but it isn't one of my favorite stories that I would watch over and over again, and there are a great many Pertwee stories that are much more worth watching repeatedly.",1366243200,,762,4.547445255474453

1905303,5,B0000ADXGA,"Another great release from the BBC and the RT!  The color restoration was better than the VHS release by leaps and bounds. It certainly wasn't quite as good as the full-color Episode 1, and there was color bleed at times (especially on Liz's hair and the Brig's uniform) but considering how much work went into restoring this serial, I think it's a pretty minor issue overall.

The commentary was great. It was nice to hear the different perspectives at different points throughout the episode. Usually I like hearing the same folks across the entire serial, but with one this long, I think swapping people in and out worked better. And it was especially great to hear Caroline John and Nick Courtney.  Here's hoping that the RT got Caroline to record a commentary for the Inferno SE.",1362441600,2,784,4.75

1905305,3,B0000ADXGA,"""The Ambassadors of Death"" is remembered fondly by almost everyone concerned with its production, so it's easy to forget that virtually everything about this story is utterly gratuitous: the excessive gunplay, the over-the-top stunt sequences, the sex appeal (yes, even the sex appeal).

While the Third Doctor and Liz Shaw tinker with the TARDIS's control panel (seen here for the first time outside its blue police box), Space Centre is monitoring a rescue ship sent to recover Mars Probe 7, an expedition to the red planet that broke off communication with Earth months earlier before mysteriously relaunching from Mars and returning to Earth orbit. (The model effects used in these scenes are shaky as usual, and the musical score rips off Stanley Kubrick's 2001.) Still unable to contact the astronauts, Earth then loses contact with the recovery ship in a burst of transmitted noise that the Doctor insists is a coded message from space. Soon a response to the message is transmitted from somewhere on Earth, and the Doctor, Liz and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart of UNIT trace it to an abandoned London warehouse.

At the warehouse, Lethbridge-Stewart and soldiers from UNIT exchange gunfire with a gang of toughs who appear to be ex-military. This lengthy shootout results in multiple casualties on both sides before the thugs surrender. Then Recovery 7 touches down outside London, but the crew still refuses to make contact or even open the ship's hatch. Then, on the way back to Space Centre, the truck carrying Recovery 7 is hijacked by another gang of bandits dropping grenades from a helicopter and zapping the UNIT guards with stun guns that look like flamethrowers without the flames.

The casualties from these wannabe James Bond-style stunt sequences are casually forgiven and forgotten when it's later revealed that the ""bad guys"" are supposedly working secretly for Her Majesty's Government to bring back the astronauts, who have been exposed to a strange type of radiation, without setting off a public panic. (In truth, the gratuitous violence was the handiwork of director Michael Ferguson, who wanted to spice up the the script and, in the process, drum up work for his stuntman pals. The results pushed the show way over budget and sent one director's assistant to the hospital.)

To summarize the story further might only spoil its mystery elements and tortuous plot twists, but be warned you may need to watch this lengthy 7-parter twice to make sense of its needlessly complicated premise. Oh, I mentioned sex appeal: Later in the story, the scruffy control-room techs we see in the early episodes are supplanted by the voluptuous Joanna Ross, whose appearance in the series was promoted by the BBC with cheesecake photos that accentuated her legs. In ""The Ambassadors of Death,"" however, viewers see her only from the neck up.

Despite these criticisms, there's no denying that Doctor Who, midway through the Third Doctor's first season, was undergoing a sea change in format and direction: this was no longer merely a children's teatime program (if it ever was), but an ambitious sci-fi action program verging on horror aimed at a teen-to-adult audience.",1357862400,,3182,5.1233140655105975
1905306,5,B0000ADXGA,"I was glad to see Amazon had this one, also. This is the one I've waited for some time. The title sort of implies tgat the aliens are here under a ruse of friendship to create mayhem on Earth. However, things aren't what they seem in what is going on. Certain members of the military are manipulating things in their favor, but the doctor's interference tends to make a mess of those plans.""-'",1353888000,,393,4.397260273972603
1905307,4,B0000ADXGA,"It's a bit on the long side at 7 parts.  But overall, quite the Bondian Doctor Who.  Action and stunts galore, OK some are a little cheesy but this is impressive on a DW budget.  The aliens aren't even the bad guys really, it's humans who are the real villains.  The new color isn't the best, looks very grainy and painted on in some parts.  Some parts had the original broadcast color so the quality switches from fine to slightly annoying.  Definitely a story from a season that was taking the show in more of an adult direction, one that would be brought back to a more kid friendly level the following season.",1353542400,,613,4.380530973451328
1905308,5,B0000ADXGA,"I have this story on a VHS tape.  I recorded it when MPT was still listening to its viewers instead of deciding what is good for us.  (What is it with ""public"" stations doing this?  WETA, despite warnings from listeners, went to an ""all talk"" format, saw its donations go off a cliff, just as listeners TOLD them it would, and then expect us to cough up like nothing ever happened.  MPT stopped begging during Dr. Who (midnight on Saturdays) so they could claim there wasn't audience interest anymore.  These stations are the reason I refuse to accomodate PBS in charitable donations anymore.)

But I digress.  I had this taped on VHS-- b&w, movie format.  I do wish there was a function on all these classic WHO dvd to let US audiences watch the stories the way we had them here-- as a full story (movie format) rather than serialized.  Ok, I'll live.  Anyway, I still think the b&w version is just as acceptable for viewing as this restored color version.  There are still bugs in the technology-- you have red leaf blips bleeding onto the roadway and car, Jon Pertwee's hair has a dark stripe in the first scene at space headquarters with the capsule, etc.  Still, not a bad job at all, in fact, I think the scene cut-aways for the bad guys chasing Caroline John are better in the colorized version-- in B&W, its painful to watch the cuts where the stuntman (Stuart Fell?) is wearing the short short skirt & gogo boots.  It doesn't look as bad (perhaps some digital editing?) in the new form.  There are also scenes in the full serial version that I had not seen before, which was nice to see-- the fight for the space capsule was really chopped in the version I had, & I finally saw the call sign of the helicopter that fans in the UK are so amused by (G-AWFL).

The story itself is well-done and hints at depth that just can't be captured in seven parts.  Lots of Who regulars in this story, including the first(?) appearance by Michael Wisher, best known for his role as the original Davros in Genesis of the Daleks (also had an appearance in Terror of the Autons, the first story in Pertwee season 2).  Only allowing one or two graphic shots of the aliens' faces and relying on the space suits with frosted-over helmets is still effectively creepy.

Flutes are used for the chase scenes because the flute seems to be Liz Shaw's signature instrument (see her first appearance in Spearhead from Space, one of my absolute favorite snippets of Who music).  Its a shame they switched to pure synthesizer in the late 70s.  That was a real loss to the charm of the show.  The commentary is fairly good, although who can keep up commenting on seven episodes when you don't really remember the filming now?  Great classic Who.",1351036800,,2724,4.516326530612245
1905309,4,B0000ADXGA,"This has been one of the most anticipated releases in the Doctor Who DVD series. Since it's one and only BBC broadcast in 1970, it's never been seen in its original color format in the UK again. All but episode one of the original video master tapes was wiped, with just (very) poor quality home recordings made in the USA and black and white tele-recordings remaining. After technological successes in 'colorizing' other stories that existed in the same formats, many attempts were made to apply the same process to this story, all of which failed. When the VHS came on to the commercial market, it was a patchwork of colorized and black and white footage. Sadly, although things have moved on considerably and they have managed to reapply the color to the entire seven part story, the quality of the result really isn't very good. Not really much anyone can do about it and it's a good attempt to restore the picture to something at least akin to the original tapes. Generally, what seems to be happening is that faces are in (overly) vivid color, but the surrounding background is largely black and white. Nobody is to blame (other than the idiots in the BBC archives who trashed the original tapes) but anyone buying this disc set expecting something picture perfect should lower their expectations. The extras are good, the commentary being well moderated and spread around amongst those taking part and there's a nice little documentary included, focussing largely on the director and the stunt team. Some excellent photos are included too, including many of the production sets and the cast in the make up room. All in all, a great story and great to see it once more in color, despite the inevitable flaws. Still, hang on to your dollars if you're not convinced. Technology will only continue to improve and the BBC will be gouging the fans with a ""Special Edition"" DVD once they've got a better process in play. That's a promise.",1350345600,8,1938,4.770833333333333

7996877,4,B0000ADXGA,"This is a very good story from Jon Pertwee's first season. It does drag a bit at 7 episodes, and this is probably the only story I've watched, where I think the omnibus version I originally watched on PBS works better than the episodic format. This is demonstrated by the frequent capture, escape and re-capture of Liz Shaw. It features rousing action sequences performed by HAVOC. The villain of the piece is not the aliens. The story is quite interesting, and the influence of the moon landing the previous year is quite evident. It's worth getting this DVD if you enjoy Jon Pertwee's tenure, the story is good, the extras are interesting, and the commentary covers a lot of different aspects, including having the stunt men involved in the story.

However, I would like to focus on Liz Shaw, an underappreciated companion. Caroline John did a good job with a character that was limited because of the Doctor she assisted. Jon Pertwee's Doctor was always the center of everything, and it was his job to save the damsel in distress, which is not the type of character that Liz Shaw was created to be. She was a professional (in spite of her dubious wardrobe choices, mini skirt, go go boots and floppy hat don't seem especially professional for a pHd scientist at the time), highly intelligent and capable. You see this in the Silurians where she continues working to find a cure for the plague created by the Silurians after the Doctor has been captured. In fact, if the Doctor hadn't been marooned on Earth by the Time Lords, I can see her becoming an excellent scientific advisor for UNIT in her own right.

Now, I mentioned that her character didn't work well as a companion for Jon Pertwee's Doctor, but that doesn't mean she wouldn't have worked for other Doctors. I can see her with David Tennant's Doctor with no trouble at all. She probably would have been a good assistant for Patrick Troughton's Doctor, and would have been an interesting choice with Colin Baker's Doctor. However, my first choice for who Liz Shaw would have made an excellent companion/assistant is Peter Davison's Doctor. His Doctor was generally a little less sure of himself, but also quite comfortable around intelligent and capable women. Watch Kinda to see his interactions with the female doctor, or the Awakening to see him with the local school teacher. Of course, he was always quite encouraging to Nyssa, who was younger, but a no less intelligent character.

As much as I enjoyed the Tegan character, I think it would have been great to have had Liz Shaw in the TARDIS during Peter Davison's first season with Nyssa and Adric. She could have been a great role model for Nyssa, and would have worked well with the Doctor. I suppose she might have been less annoyed by Adric than Tegan, but that's probably the most we could hope for in that quarter...

Oh well, was not to be. So, instead sit down to watch this fascinating story and imagine what could have been with Dr. Liz Shaw.",1509840000,,2972,4.687739463601533

7996879,4,B0000ADXGA,"This is the weakest story in Season 7 and thats a good case for why Season 7 is probably one of the best seasons of Doctor Who ever made. In this story, we have a mystery involving three missing astronauts, and various attempts at sabotage and cover up. Its a grand conspiracy with double crosses, triple crosses, and plenty of action.

All of the regulars are firing on all cylinders with the Doctor being a true menance to this dangerous conspiracy, Liz Shaw showing how well she can operate on her own, and the Brig having a fairly strong story particularly in the final episode.  The storys filled with action, suspense, and a nice helping of terror.  Theres some great surprises and twists to this story that turn the typical Doctor Who formulas on their head.
In many season, this would be a highlight, however as the other stories in Season 7: Sparehead from Space, the Silurians, and Inferno are all masterful classics, this one is easily overlooked. However, if youve not seen it, its highly reccomended. As General Carrington would say, Its your moral duty.",1498694400,,1067,4.725806451612903
