486867,4,6302606993,"URUSEI YATSURA: ONLY YOU (1983) was the first theatrical movie spun off from the popular animated sci-fi teen comedy TV series, ""Urusei Yatsura,"" based on Rumiko Takahashi's long-running manga about the misadventures of horny high-schooler Ataru and his stormy relationship with his shapely, horned, tiger-skin-bikini'd alien ""wife,"" Lum. It offers a full-blown science fiction setting, complete with the transport of Ataru and all his high school chums to an exotic city on another planet, as the backdrop for an imaginative, funny and, ultimately quite touching romantic farce that sustains its manic pace of comic suspense to the very end. To make a long, eventful story short, Ataru finds himself engaged, inadvertently, to yet another gorgeous alien, the privileged and pampered Lady Elle, and is taken to her planet with Lum and all her friends in hot pursuit. Ataru shows no unwillingness to go, seeing as how this is a golden opportunity to meet a new hot babe-and get away from the clinging Lum. However, after a short-lived idyll with Elle in her palace, Ataru suddenly sees her true colors and is soon praying for Lum & co. to come and prevent the wedding.
Fans of the series will enjoy this immensely, thanks to the way the writers have fashioned a story that makes clever use of all the main characters and a plot that takes them to the far reaches of the galaxy, back and forth in time, and finally back to their provincial little Japanese suburb. Those fans with an eye for anime babes will find plenty of female alien sex appeal on display here, thanks to the prominent roles played by Elle, Lum, and Lum's array of provocatively costumed girlfriends, not to mention Elle's army of female guards. The animation is more fluid than that of the TV series, with lots of intricate chases and battle action, and the design much more detailed. The film was directed by Mamoru Oshii, who also directed the first few seasons of the TV series and the second UY movie, BEAUTIFUL DREAMER. (He would go on to direct the PATLABOR movies and the anime sci-fi classic, GHOST IN THE SHELL.)",1058659200,,2089,4.837988826815643
486868,5,6302606993,"I'm sure most people know Oshii Mamoru from his sci-fi anime of a late  eighties and nineties such as Patlabor and Ghost in the Shell. However,  most fans of his later work don't seem to pay much attention to his earlier  work on the Urusei Yatsura TV series and the first two of its six  subsequent movies. I suppose the Gibson-esque world of Ghost in the Shell  is considered much more interesting by most than the Flash Gordon hamminess  of Lum, but if one looks closely they will find just as thoughtfully  crafted work and, in the case of the first movie, an excellent example of  how a ridiculous idea can be skillfully molded into engaging, light-hearted  entertainment.
By the time Urusei Yatsura: Only You came out in 1983, Lum  already had an extremely strong following in Japan in both the manga and  the TV series, and thus faced the typical problem all well-established  series do when being converted into major motion pictures: how to include  all the conventions of the series but also give the film a compelling story  that anyone can enjoy. Fortunately, Only You does this remarkably  well.
For the uninitiated, Urusei Yatsura: Only You tells the story of  Ataru Moroboshi, the most lecherous man in the Universe, and Lum, the  bikini-clad space princess that is determined to tame him. Other characters  include Shinobu, Ataru's would-be girlfriend; Mendou, the richest man in  the world and rival of Ataru; and Benten, Lum's best friend and space  biker-chick who wears chains. There are several dozen other Urusei Yatsura  regulars that appear in this movie also, but the plot basically focuses  around Lum and Ataru in this movie with most of the other characters being  regulated to cameos of varying degrees.
What the film does really well is  capture the spirit, energy, and fun of Takahashi Rumiko's manga and the TV  series while juggling situations and characters that effectively serve  their purpose without bogging down the over all pace of the story. The plot  involves Ataru's kidnapping by a rival space princess named Elle who wants  to marry him, and Lum's attempts to win him back. From there the story  takes off into an epic space farce that should make any fan of anime as  well as classic sci-fi smile.
The film contains several well-crafted  scenes. The prologue where children are shown only in silhouette is cute  and effective, and the title sequence is so wonderfully overdone that it  refrains from saying ""The Movie!"" only by sheer force of will.  Another scene I like is the first space battle that takes place between  Lum's planet and Elle's planet. There is a very funny scene where Oshii has  some fun cross-cutting between Ataru's refusal to admit he loves Lum and  the stalwart conviction of the pilots who are fighting to defend their  marriage. The visit to Planet Elle itself is another memorable sequence.  Seemingly constructed in the shape of a giant rose, it invokes the kind of  tacky paradise image that classic Star Trek only wished for. This is also  where the final sequence of the film takes place, where Lum and her friends  wage a bizarre battle to crash Elle's wedding. I have to admit there is  something extremely endearing about beautiful little Lum piloting her  fighter through a gauntlet to save the most worthless man in the Universe,  and the final scene, which seems directly inspired by The Graduate, is so  romantically cornball that I can't help but be utterly won over every time  I see it.
The reason why this movie works is because Oshii Mamoru has the  decency to take it seriously. He does not condescend to the material at  all, and stays firmly focused on its goofiest obsessions even in their  tackiest extremities. The musical choices he makes in the film add to this  considerably. Scoring the film like a old sci-fi serial is a delightful  addition, and the use of songs and musical numbers throughout the film are  warmly affectionate in the way that they have the decency to focus on the  sentiment of the moment amidst the farce.
Urusei Yatsura: Only You is  excellent light entertainment. It is likable, fast-paced, tacky, absurd,  and completely silly. In other words, it is everything a Lum movie should  be.",965779200,3,4208,4.831460674157303

It's a classic romp with happy and sad moments and it gets the ball rolling on one of the oldest relationships in anime history. A gorgeous alien girl falls in love with one of the worst lechers in the universe, except you learn he's likely one of the best specimens of mankind throughout the course of the show.

7828132,5,6302606993,"In 1983, Rumiko Takahashi's Urusei Yatsura had nowhere to go but up. With its stellar production team, excellent writers and simply fantastic voice tallent, the series, then helmed by director Mamoru Oshii(who later went on to be known for his work with Ghost in the Shell among others) needed only a final push to send it rocketing into its respected place in anime history.

That final push was Urusei Yatsura Movie 1: Only You. With its larger budget, it was the first time we saw exactly what the UY team could muster up. An excellent story and then cutting edge animation are only made more impressive by the fact that this film was also created along side the regular series' 3rd season.

The film opens with a sequence, painted only in orange, black, and white, of two children playing shadow tag. As the boy announces to the girl that he has won the game by stepping on her shadow, she in turn informs him that she is an alien and that on her planed stepping on someone's shadow is a marriage proposal. She boards a space craft, and tells her play mate that she will return in 11 years. When the student's of Tomobiki High School suddenly receive wedding invitations to Ataru Moroboshi's wedding, sparks between him and Lum begin flying.

In comparison to Movie 2, Only You requires the viewer to have seen substantial portions of the first two seasons to fully grasp the relations between certain characters. Most notably, this applies to Benten, who undergoes some substantial character development. We see her blossom from a somewhat disposable secondary character to a supporting character who reapers again and again from here on out. If you've seen any of season one and two of Urusei Yatsura, you're more than familiar with the characters who just mysteriously vanish from the series after a thorough introduction.

Speaking of one off characters, Elle is one of the most well done antagonists I've seen in UY thus far. She's a very complicated character. Even by the end of the film, her true intentions on Ataru are still very much a mystery. She inspires sympathy and malice as a diabolical female Ataru on an incomprehensible scale. She can go from a sunny and bright girl whose saccharine sweet demeanor rivals that of Lum, to a literal ice queen, often with in one scene.

The film is also important in the development of the Lum/Ataru relationship. Here, along with the fist episode of season 3 are some of our first glimpses into the nature of Ataru's real feelings towards Lum, with all bravado and machismo stripped away.

Above all, Only You manages to strike a balance of drama and comedy that makes for a serious film that retains the whimsical and absurdist nature of the Manga and TV series. There's not so much dramatic action that the film feels like a Leji Matsumoto Space Opera(Although it is blatantly obvious that Matsumoto's classics had profound influence on the movie), but there is markedly less of the bizarre comedy of the series. This balance is very much like that found in early portions of Takahashi's recently completed Inu Yasha series.

All in all, for the Urusei Yatsura fan, the film is classic UY at its very best. You have here a movie of pure entertainment that incorporates all the hallmarks of UY into a neat little package. It is intensely satisfying, and has some very edge of your seat moments. A warning: New comers to UY need not begin here, however. Since this film draws so heavily on some of the support characters of the TV series, to fully understand the relationships(and appreciate this film), one really needs to see at least episodes 1-18.",1250467200,,3609,4.755591054313099

7828134,5,6302606993,"When everyone in Tomobiki receives invitations for Ataru's wedding, and Lum's not the bride, it doesn't take much to get everyone into an uproar. Things don't get better when it turns out that Ataru's bride-to-be is another alien princess.",1129680000,,239,5.153846153846154
7828135,4,6302606993,"""Only You"" is probably one of my favorite Urusei Yatsura movies, tied along with ""Beautiful Dreamer"" and ""The Final Chapter"". If you're a casual viewer, you might want to check out the TV series and get to know the characters before diving into this one. But if you're an established UY fan, then this will be a real treat.

The movie puts the usual slapstick comedy in the back, and prefers to focus on the more heartwrenching scenes. Don't get me wrong, there are enough things to laugh at, such as the UY trademark subtle face expressions (of which Ataru is a master at), good ol' tiger-bull Rei's obliviousness, and the monk Cherry's appearances -- but the primary focus of the film is set on scenes that squeezes your heart.

And the scenes are, fortunately, quite well done. I'm a man, and I'm not afraid to admit that the ""Lum in space"" scene with ""Lum no Ballad"" playing in the background got me choked up -- and I'm usually quite apathetic to scenes like that in movies. Ataru watching with fear and concern for Lum in the back of a fighter jet is another tug. And of course, the final scene at the end alone is worth the time and money for any long time UY fans -- those that've seen the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about.

Unfortunately, as with any movie, there tend to be a few flaws. For one, the humans don't really get to do anything. This includes Mendou, Shinobu, Megane & Fan club, Cherry, and especially Sakura. Sure, Mendou, Shinobu, and Megane fare better than the others, but for the better part of the movie, they were just ""there"" for the sake of appearances. Cherry gets a bit of spotlight early on, but then disappears. I get the feeling that Sakura was just brought in to appease the Sakura fans since she had a few lines but did absolutely nothing else.

On the other hand, if you're a fan of the aliens (especially Benten), then you're in for a treat. Benten shows up A LOT, Oyuki gets some scenes, and even Rei jumps into the action. Ran also helps out, as do Mr. Invader himself. You'll even hear a few lines from the Crow Princess, Kurama.

Another flaw would be the characterization of Ellie. For a main villain, she seemed rather one-dimensional. Her design is good, and she can definitely compete with the other UY females in terms of beauty.... but when it comes to personality, we aren't given much about her. Reasons for why she did her malicious deeds are never explained, and nothing is said about how she came to be. And worse of all, just when we're about to get a glimpse of the surface below, the movie's about over. Sigh.

All in all, if you 1) are familar with Urusei Yatsura and its characters, 2) are a big fan of the Lum+Ataru relationship (and who isn't?), and 3) don't mind a few flaws, then you need to see this movie, no questions asked.",1078531200,6,2804,4.445525291828794

Diddn't the Dub of episode one teach him anything?

7828137,4,6302606993,"I have this movie on japanese laserdisc.
If you're a fan of Tahahashi Rumiko and in particular the Urusai Yatsura series this is a must have.
UY is a twist on the Von Daniken theory where most of the aliens are beings from japanese folklore, Oni, Tengu and yuki-onna.
The story opens with every regular character receiving an invitation to the wedding beween Ataru and someone called Elle.  The only person happy about the news Is Ataru though he doesn't remember her.(he won a game of shadow tag when he was 6 which is tantamont to being eng
aged on her world).
Elle turns out to be the Queen of the Rose star world, Lum who regards herself as Ataru's wife decides not take this lying down and takes all the regulars to her home world the Oni star and officially marry him first.  But, on the way they are intercepted by the Rose star fleet and Ataru is liberated by rose star agent during which he says things over an open mike that discourage anyone from the Oni world from wanting him back.
How will Lum react?
As I haven""t seen the DVD I can't comment on the translation or the english voice acting or extras. and they may not be calling it the Rose star.....
This film eatures a lot of the serious to outrageous humor that was the trademrk of the UY series.  It's the second best of the 6 UY movies after Beautiful Dreamer, already available on DVD.
4 stars as it's very good for what it is but less appeal for people who arenot familiar with UY or anime.",1062806400,4,1461,4.324817518248175
