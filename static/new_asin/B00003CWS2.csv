1262185,4,B00003CWS2,"This movie almost defies description. First, it is not a big movie, nor does it fit in the normal WWII genre. It doesn't contain the brutality of Schindler's List, but it deals with the same general subject. It is a  somewhat dark movie but with amusing moments. It is certainly not your  normal Robin William's vehicle, but he certainly plays the part of Jakob  with fervor.
Ultimately, the movie ends like all movies of this type do,  but it's hard to feel all bad about its outcome. This is a very good movie,  but one that leaves a curiously empty feeling when all is said and done.  One fact stands out above all: this movie deserves better than it got at  the box office.",955756800,28,677,4.411290322580645
1262186,4,B00003CWS2,"If you've seen Life is Beautiful...you will like this for sure...for those who haven't...the movie takes place in a Jewish ""ghetto"" under  Germany's control. This movie isn't a war story as much as it is about Hope  and the ability to bring hope to people in the most dire of circumstances.  Robin Williams is very good in this movie although maybe not quite  frightened enough of the Germans. Although I guess without experiencing  that sort of thing, it would be hard to portray the kind of fear that I'm  sure the people at that time felt. The movie has a few light-hearted  moments that add to the flow of the movie...although be warned, it starts a  little slow. The pay off definitely comes in the end though.",955238400,,715,4.574803149606299
1262187,5,B00003CWS2,"This film depicts the power of hope, even in the most dire circumstances. This film is humorous without minimizing the suffering of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. The movie kept my interest throughout. Robin Williams  was excellent as an unlikely hero.",954720000,,257,4.840909090909091
1262188,3,B00003CWS2,"This seems like a ""diet"" version of the holocaust. There are guards, dogs, people shot, but it's not all there. Main role played by Robin Williams.. Doesn't quite connect in my view beacuse I'm used to  seeing him in more comical roles which conflicted while watching this  movie. This movie reminds a bit last year's big Italian hit - ""Life is  Beautiful"", the story is very much similar. I would rate this one a  family movie, no extreme drama or harsh scenes as one might have expected.",954288000,2,489,4.586206896551724
1262189,5,B00003CWS2,This is the best movie after only hearing about this movie onetime I rented it and it was the best movie. It was sad but it has tonsof grate points in it. Based on Jacob who lies because he dose not want to tell them the truth that the war is not ending and who knows how long they have to stay there. This is based on when hiltler was around and keeping the jews for work and stuff because he dint like them. This is a hartworming movie that it deffintly worth the 3 dollors you pay to rent it.

Something was not quite right about this film. It is hard to pinpoint.  I loved what Jakob did, but it seemed somehow forced on him.  I also found a bit of over-acting  & seriously doubt the immorality of the engaged couple but maybe I am just a prude!

1262259,5,B00003CWS2,"I always show this movie at the end of a Holocaust unit I do with my English students.  The worst criticism I have ever heard was ""It was pretty good, I guess.""  (Coming from high school students who seem to like action-packed movies, I think this is a compliment.) Most students really like the movie.  Nearly all have seen other Robin Williams movies, and think his portrayal of Jakob is excellent.  Other students comment that they have seen other Holocaust movies, but few take place in a Ghetto. (Most are in the actual concentration camps, and they like that this is different.)  I personally think that this is one of the best movies about the Holocaust there is.  Subtle bits of humor makes it very realistic-even though the situation was terrible, it was possible for people to smile, laugh, and even fall in love.",1458259200,2,823,4.680555555555555

Robin's character Jakob takes it upon himself to lift the spirits of the other scared Jews around him. He talks about serious subjects with his fellow Jews but yet he adds a spin of comedy. The drama aspect of the movie does show the reality of Jews disappearing never to be seen again. Jakob the Liar also shows how the Jewish population is hunted and killed sometimes right in the streets. The story takes place in one of the small Jewish Ghettos where everyone knows and cares about each other. At this time in Jewish history it is illegal for Jews to have radios so that they do not know what is going on with the war.

1262450,5,B00003CWS2,I had a copy of this that was loaned and lost ( will think twice before another loan) and found it quite a interesting story. It does dress up the true instances of the life it portrays but gives enough what could be taken as fact combined with acting to make it well worth keeping in my collection. Again as with any stories of Nazi brutality there are some graphic scenes that should be considered when thinking of a viewing audience.,1377129600,,436,4.395061728395062

1262455,4,B00003CWS2,"This movie does a decent job of creating the hardship of the plight of German Jews under the Hitler regime, but leaves one wondering how the real Jakob actually got caught up in the role. The movie makes it appear he was catapulted into the role of hero storyteller by the desperate circumstances. Plausible, but one would need to look for that answer in sources other than the movie.
Great acting on the part of the cast and a steady pace leading up to a sad but realistic ending make this a good movie for those who like flicks about The Holocaust, but for viewers who don't it might be disappointing.
I gave it 4 stars because it is more than worthwhile, with good actors and scenes.",1366502400,,686,4.409448818897638
1262456,3,B00003CWS2,"I have to give credit where credit is due; the film does have an inspiring message of hope and Robin Williams as well as Hannah Taylor-Gordon do a beautiful job in their roles.

However, this is a very, very, very idealized Hollywood version of the Holocaust.

While the film does give us glimpses of fear and suffering, it is mostly a overly simplified depiction of life in the ghetto and life under Nazi persecution.

I don't think the film should be completely brushed off as garbage though; I can see it being a useful tool for parents or educators who are starting to expose children/preteens to the Holocaust. Due to the watered down nature of the film, it wouldn't be overwhelming for a younger audience.

But he's trapped by a flying newspaper: he is so eager for news that he is chasing a newspaper flying in the wind all over the ghetto, and accidentally comes against a barbed-wire gate just minutes before the curfew, and is sent to the German officer's office to find out what his punishment is to be. While waiting for the officer to appear, he accidentally overhears a radio broadcast that says the Soviets are getting close.

The German officer lets him go without enough time to get home before curfew, so he cuts through the railroad yard. Hiding there is a 10 1/2 year old girl who was dropped out of the bottom of a boxcar carrying her parents and many others to a concentration camp. They shoved her out to save her life. She and Jakob first startle each other for being out after curfew, then help each other. When he discovers that she has no home and no place to go, he takes her home with him.

Jakob tells one friend that he ""heard a radio,"" which told him the Soviets are near. The friend persistently interprets to mean that he has a radio hidden in his apartment, which is a capital crime if it is discovered. The friend is sworn to secrecy, but when he goes to his girlfriend's apartment, he can't help telling the people there that the Soviets are near. When they are skeptical, he says that Jakob has a radio.

By the following morning, the entire ghetto knows that Jakob has a radio, and they admire his courage in keeping it. But of course, they want to hear it, want him to tell them the current news. He mentions to one guy that he heard it in the German officer's office, and the man responds with, ""What were you doing there, informing?"" He eventually realizes that he cannot set the record straight about his having a radio, and begins making up advances by the Soviet troops to keep up morale. The local barber (Alan Arkin) tries to commit suicide, and Jakob talks him out of it by saying the Soviets will be here ""in just a few days.""

On the work detail and among other Jews, Jakob is telling elaborate lies because he sees it brings the people hope. But when the excitement gets the barber killed, Jakob blames himself. Ultimately, Jakob refuses to cooperate with the German officer in whose office he actually heard the radio, and is ordered to tell everyone in the ghetto that he lied about the radio, and about the advances the allies were making every day.

It's a serious film, sure enough, but Robin Williams manages to stick quite a few very good jokes and touching moments, especially with the little girl whom he has hidden in his attic.",1337040000,,2677,4.455102040816326
1262458,2,B00003CWS2,"Who knew life in a Jewish ghetto could contain so much levity?

I can hear the studio pitch meeting... ""Schindler's List meets Good Morning Vietnam! It can't miss!""

It missed.

The cast, cinematography, art direction and costuming were top-notch. The story and directing, not so much.

Let's run down the cliche' list the director must have had:

!. Nazi dressed in the obligatory leather trench coat. Check.

2. Little girl that looks like Anne Frank. Check.

3. Predictable ending. Check.

4. Robin Williams acting like Robin Williams. Check.

With the style and level of comedy in this film, one could easily come away thinking that life in the ghettos was mostly happy-go-lucky. That's a disservice to those that went through the experience. Comedy can have its place in even the darkest stories, and in many cases, humor is actually needed to help bolster the main storyline.

The following is not a spoiler...

This is an AWESOME movie with yet another ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC acting job  by Robin Williams. The end is a little sad, but still great. This is a must see movie.",1327276800,,338,4.2
1262490,4,B00003CWS2,"Prior to the 1999 Hollywood adaptation of Jacob the Liar starring Robin Williams, there was a 1974 East German production titled ""Jakob der Lugner"" which won a Silver Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival. I do think the German version was more realistic, gritty, and credible, but I appreciated the 1999 Hollywood version as well.

In the 1999 adaptation, Robin Williams portrays Jacob Heim, a potato pancake (latke) seller whose business has long since folded. It is World War Two, and Jakob and his fellow Jews from a Polish town have been imprisoned in a ghetto under Nazi rule. One night, Jakob accidentally misses curfew and is sent to the Komandatur, the ghetto HQ. While waiting for the camp commandant, he hears some news on the radio (radios were banned in the ghetto and possession of one was punishable by death). That same night, Jakob, who is trying desperately to find a way back into the ghetto, meets a young girl named Lina (Hannah Taylor-Gordon) whose parents, in the hopes that she will survive, have forced her to leave their train which is headed to the camps. The pair make it back into the ghetto and Jakob reluctantly agrees to care for the girl.

The next morning, Jakob passes the news he heard on the radio along to a fellow worker (all able-bodied Jews had to work, usually hard, manual work) named Mischa (Liev Schreiber) and soon rumors spread - that Jakob is in possession of a radio. Soon everyone, including Jakob's best friend, the barber Kowalsky (Bob Balaban) are eagerly awaiting favorable news from Jakob regarding the war - are the Russians approaching, and will their torment be over soon? Jakob initially tries to be truthful and set things right, but when he sees how his news is giving the ghetto residents some hope for the future, he is convinced to keep up the pretense, hence Jakob the Liar is born. But will the truth eventually catch up with Jakob?

Robin Williams delivers a heart-wrenching performance as Jakob, though his portrayal can be a little over the top at times. I think his performance is credible and poignant. Hannah Taylor-Gordon is wonderful as the young girl who keeps Jakob rooted, and the pair develop a very close bond. Liev Schreiber is convincing as the reckless Mischa who craves adventure and romance. Armin Mueller-Stahl who is one of my favorite actors is stoic in his portrayal of the brilliant doctor who encourages Jakob in his deception because he realizes just how much the ghetto residents need hope in order to survive. Alan Arkin credibly portrays the former stage actor who is one of the few who are skeptical of Jakob's news.

Unlike many other Holocaust movies which tend to be utterly bleak, there is lots of humor here to offset the darkness. I would recommend viewers watch both the original version and this in order to get the best viewing experience.",1326412800,2,2844,4.774390243902439

1262495,5,B00003CWS2,"Not history. A powerful tale of tragedy & a man who helped where he could. Robin Williams gets my applause for portraying this complex character, a serious role, even brutally interrogated. Jakob also tried to lighten the spirits of ghetto imprisoned Jewish friends. To save barber Kowalsky (Bob Balaban) from attempted suicide he says he has a secret radio and gives reports of hope. The news passes throughout the ghetto like fire. Additional fake news lifts morale, provides ghetto hope, changes lives, all while Jakob also performs acts of human kindness and helps friends enrich life in death's face. His fake reports end Jew ghetto suicides.

Jacob hides a girl of 10, Lina (Hannah Taylor-Gordon) while the entire ghetto hears radio rumors. The Jews want more and more news to bolster their faith and inspire hope. All the while, people are being trained out, like Lina's parents, in the tragic events of ""The Holocaust."" This film perhaps shows what the average man/woman felt, and how they dealt with the unspeakable horror of their time and life. Cast is filled with award winning stars, most noted in the listing material.

View this movie not as another documentary of the WWII times, but of one man's wartime effort to make life something bearable. There is some humor amid the primary story of tragedy. Jakob need to embellish his news gets him caught up in improvisation such as explaining ""American tanks have a 'clean' sound."" Yes, Jakob's lies were just attempts to life spirits, remove thoughts from the horror, and provide hope.

For the viewer, Jakob does not trivialize the Holocaust, as proved by the ending scenes, which will send your heart's emotions on a whirlwind roller-coaster ride. You will cry, laugh, feel despair then joy, love, hate, and perhaps even become inspired by a group of people who determined to LIVE in the face of death. As realistic as ""Holocaust (1978)"" the series.

Wonderful sets, costumes and props. Takes you right back to the 1940s Polish ghetto (hopefully never duplicated for real). Rated PG in Canada, but it has some horrific scenes. Maybe not for kids.

1262511,3,B00003CWS2,"Since Amazon have seen fit to lump together reviews of both versions of this story, two separate reviews for the films: just be sure which one you're ordering when you order.

JAKOB DER LUGNER

Jakob the Liar/Jakob der Lugner was the only East German film to be Oscar-nominated and, considering how neatly it falls into the ever-popular tradition of East German films reminding the population of their sins during the war as a means to engender guilt and stifle criticism, it's surprising to learn how difficult it was to get made after the government detected a possibly subversive thread - you don't think the Nazis could be symbolising the communists, do you? It's a good film but not a great one, surprisingly visually unimaginative considering the strong qualities of Frank Beyer's other films and only really starting to hit home in the last half hour. Still, it's hard to dislike a film that begins with the caption `The story of Jakob the Liar is not true. Honest. Or perhaps it is.'

Armin Mueller-Stahl also featured in the Robin Williams remake, and its interesting to see note the way his stock-in-trade changed from slightly dense working class to his respectable and likeable grandpa schtick after the crossing the border.

JACOB THE LIAR

Jakob the Liar/Jakob der Lugner was the only East German film to be Oscar-nominated, yet it was long-forgotten by the time this much-delayed Robin Williams remake finally made it to cinema screens. Indeed, many people thought it a ripoff of Life is Beautiful, despite being finished long before it's rival.

It's certainly isn't really deserving of the contempt poured on it when it was initially released in the wake of Roberto Begnini's surprise hit. The film certainly has better design and resources than the original, but the tone is a constant problem. It's not so much that the comedy is highlighted at the expense of its Warsaw Ghetto background, more that the comedy doesn't work because it seems overplayed - like the performances, it's always a little too big to convince. On the plus side, it goes to a few darker places than the original, but loses all its Brownie points with a hideous Hollywood ending that may just be another lie but just seems like the wrong lie.

Armin Mueller-Stahl features in both the original East German version and this remake, and its interesting to see note the way his stock-in-trade changed from slightly dense working class to his respectable and likeable grandpa schtick after the crossing the border.",1194912000,2,2502,4.92874109263658

Sent back to the ghetto, Jakob becomes entangled in a web of fiction that keeps false hope alive for those who see transport trains coming to take them to the Camps.

Perhaps if I had seen this film before the far more serious and deftly directed THE PIANIST,or before the Academy Award winning LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL or the incredibly funny and ironic TRAIN OF LIFE, I might have been able to find the humor,charm and seriousness intended in JAKOB THE LIAR,but I couldn't, try as I did. I found the movie not certain of what genre it needed to be. It worked neither as a comedy,drama OR a dramedy. Jakob was always Robin Williams in a bad accent. The set appeared cheap and I fear will always be compared with the above mentioned films that were far more on target as films about the Holocaust.

Yes, we all know Robin Williams to be the slapstick comedian which has brought tears of laughter to our eyes instead of ones of compassion. But like  Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful, Williams brings to life a character who tries to lift the spirits of friends and strangers who are looking for one thing, hope.

Whether Williams' character was real or imaginary, the human spirit can never be completely wiped by tyranny and oppression. 10 million people, including 6 million Jews were systematically killed before the Nazi's were finally stopped. Some died as fighters, some gave their lives for others, and some gave just simple acts of kindness, good will, and love. Each one of them were heroes of their own kind.

 William's character told lies about Russian troop advancement to give the Jews of his Ghetto the will to survive and resist. Like real life heroes such as Rauol Wallenberg, Oskar Schindler, Mordecai Anielewicz, Hannah Senesh, and thousands of others who risked their lives for others, this is a story of a good man.

1262539,4,B00003CWS2,"I have not read the book but I greatly enjoyed the movie. Good narrative, excellent cinematography, and some stunning background music. While the film may be held guilty for some cardboard characters (e.g., all Germans are mean looking men), Robin Williams was surely under-appreciated in his very concvincing cameo as Jakob, a pancake vendor, who pretends to have a radio and distribute good news to other Jews in the ghetto -- and I don't mean just the accent. The guy is brilliant.
The theme is a cross between ""Goodmorning Vietnam"" meets ""Life is beautiful"" -- classic cultural interpretations of the forced lifestyle of the characters promote the effect of a rumour that a working radio exists in the barbed-wire ghetto, allowing a lowly pancake-vendor to raise to heroic proportions amidst his small group of associates and lie in the face of hope-dashing truth.
At its heart, the story is about the irrefutable spirit of human life despite seemingly unsurmountable odds as Jakob deals with the consequences of either perpetuating his lie or coming out with the whole truth, weighing hope against despair. Swept up in his own joking accident and a few well-timed coincidences, endorsed by the ghetto residents, the ghetto organizes to resist their Nazi oppressors.
As the fall of the Third Reich becomes more and more likely, the tangle of truth and falsity tightens around Jakob and each lie becomes more and more needed.
An interesting angle to look at the Holocaust, it serves as one of the better movies to introduce younger audiences to that odious period of human history. Oh, and did I mention that the background score is marvellous?",1070064000,22,1647,5.014598540145985

As history has shown, Communists brought exponentially worse barbarism to these persecuted folk and, if anything, the Germans had behaved like gentleman with them in comparison; these latter would often be remembered for turning a blind eye to the odd son, daughter or mother who pleaded to be set free temporarily for any small reason - and never, of course, to return. In ""Jakob,"" there is no compassion on the part of the troops. No laughter or camaraderie among the Jewish people (the character playing the barber follows the trend of suicides en masse, without even saying goodbye to his pal Jakob), and, in the end, the prospect of a positive ending - the type of ending the film makes you believe is coming - is foiled instead for yet another shot at the beleaguered Nazi militia, though I won't specify in what sense exactly.",1049068800,7,1164,4.796019900497512

Let's face it, in real life, which is not always accurately portrayed in reel life, dire and grim circumstances often prompt a gallows humor--thus the origin of the term.
Additionally, it is essential if you consider yourself a devotee of film, to listen to the director's commentary.  His observations on the making of the movie, particularly, concerning the differences between European and American film making are absolutely brilliant.  His comment that complexity and subtlety are ""good"" comments in Europe, but box office poison in the States are absolutely sad, but true.

Jakob's wife is killed and his neighborhood is turned into a ghetto. So that's where the movie picks up at. Jakob is looking at a tree where he first kissed his late wife at the ghetto wall.
The curfew that the jews can't be out of their homes is 8:00 P.M. So Jakob (Robin Williams) is found outside close to 8 P.M. He gets told to go see the officer on duty and get his punshiment. Before the war Jakob ran a cafe. He made food like Potato Pancakes.
Jakob has a deal with Kowalsky. He gets a free shave every morning. And Kowalsky gets to eat as many Potatos Pancakes as he wants. But the problem is that Jakob hasn't made pancakes in in three years because the germans don't allow any potatos in the ghetto.

  You would think all would be well in knowing liberation is just around the corner except it is not true. There never was a radio. Jacob's telling of another story gets misunderstood to the point where people believe he has a radio. As the rumor spreads Jacob knows his life is in danger for his Nazis captors will kill him. Jacob wants to survive. His people want news. He lies.
  Robin Williams portrays a character caught in a rough situation. What do you do when a lie brings hope? At the same time it has brought death. How much should you say when your every word could endanger your entire community? We see Jacob facing this delicate balance of a moral dilemma in which no clear answers appear. What do you do in such a situation? Feed people with false hope or stay the course of survival? Such is the heart of this film which shows us what can happen in an absurd crisis which becomes a danger to all. A bit of humor and life comes through with Williams as he shows that those in the ghetto still lived life inspite of the Nazis. Will they be able to survive through Jacob's lies? You find the answer.",979084800,15,1394,4.309160305343512

But I loved it anyway; it was filmed nicely, it had an amazing story line, and it looked like it was filmed and crafted with great care. I will no doubt someday buy this on DVD. See this film without having any experience of any other movie -- just take it all in AS an experience. The ending may have fallen short; but... well... it retrospect it probably couldn't of ended any other way.",977356800,4,435,4.253012048192771
1262581,2,B00003CWS2,"Filmmakers with the chutzpah to tackle the holocaust always have to tread along some pretty slippery ground. How does one visualize the unimaginable horrors of such an apocalyptic human event without flinching, yet make it all palatable enough to keep the audience from fleeing the theatre? In addition, one must always avoid offending any of the actuals survivors who rightfully bridle at the first sign of softening or sugarcoating. Precious few film have managed to accomplish this feat and transform the experience into works of lasting art. In addition to ""Schindler's List,"" of course, two other successful films come to mind: the 1965 Czech masterpiece, ""The Shop on Main Street,"" and the beautiful 1983 Hungarian film, ""The Revolt of Job."" One of the reasons these three films succeed is because they all approach the subject from the viewpoint of a gentile outsider who is drawn into the momentous event and whose consequent moral dilemma becomes the audience's own. Through this approach, the audience is put not in the position of a helpless victim, doomed to unimaginable suffering, but of a participant whose actions could stand the chance of affecting a positive outcome on at least a small scale. The result is that each of these films avoids the overwhelming sense of depression and hopelessness that otherwise would accompany this heavy subject matter.
""Jakob the Liar,"" like the recent ""Life is Beautiful,"" plunges us directly into the center of the horror - the Warsaw ghetto in the months right before the Russian invasion of Poland. Robin Williams portrays Jakob, a former restauranteur who, through a series of flukes, manages to convince his fellow captives that he has a hidden radio which continually broadcasts news of the Russians' advance. This results in a temporary renewal of hope and courage as the inhabitants of the ghetto begin a plan of insurrection.
Despite obviously noble intentions, ""Jacob the Liar,"" itself a remake of a 1976 Polish film, seems far too artificial in its story and performances to ring true. Although Williams gives a relatively restrained account of himself and keeps the unctiousness of many of his recent film portrayals down to a minimum, he is still recognizable as Robin Williams, replete with the occasional stand-up comedian schtick, such as when he acts out all the voices in an ersatz radio program for the benefit of a little girl who has become his inadvertant ward. All throughout the movie, the writers provide moments of inappropriate mirth and slapstick that rob the subject of the seriousness of its purpose. And, although one sympathizes with the reason for doing so, is it really necessary to provide such an upbeat finale to a supposedly serious holocaust drama? This merely emphasizes the artificiality of the whole enterprise.
One hesitates to be too harsh on a film of this nature. Certainly, its makers were driven far more by their love of the subject than the expectation of great boxoffice success - and ""Jakob the Liar"" is certainly no disgraceful failure for which its makers need be ashamed. It simply misses its mark both as a chronicle of the horrors of the holocaust and as a work of art. To see how that can be done, please check out ""The Shop on Main Street,"" which still stands as quite simply one of the greatest films ever made!",971395200,23,3323,4.9784172661870505
1262582,4,B00003CWS2,"The week before seeing this film, my wife and I travelled to Krakow, Poland to see Auschwitz.  We then visited Prague.  I have to tell you, if  your frame of reference is boomer generation American living in Europe and  having visited the real thing -- rather than other movies -- the film is a  revelation.
We stumbled across this rental in a UK Blockbuster, rented  it, and were stunned by it.  It felt closer in atmosphere and nuance to  where we'd just been than anything we've ever seen.  It is a  ""small"" movie: no grand gestures, no sweeping vistas or bright  colors. No  ""pops"" in the story line, no grand themes  caricatured. This is not to say that we don't have our own copies of  Schindler's List and Life is Beautiful, nor that these films suffer from  these defects!
But...if you haven't been to this part of the world, the  one film of these three that would be most consistent with what you felt  and intuited would probably be this one.
I'm sorry the critics didn't  like it.  It is something out of the ordinary, and appears to have been a  labor of love.",965433600,47,1073,4.43298969072165
1262583,5,B00003CWS2,"I just bought this movie last night at Wal-mart and watched it. I am so glad I did. There are some people who are giving it bad reviews. I think it deserves only good ones. Robin Williams is excellent and plays the title  role perfectly. It is the story about a man in the ghetto who begins to  pretend he has a radio in order to give other jews hope. While telling his  lies he is secretly hiding a little jewish girl in his attic in order to  keep her from going to a camp. I won't give away the ending but I will say  the ending is very powerful and will move you to tears. This movie can be  brilliantly funny, and then turn bitterly tragic, and evn after that come  through as an amazingly powerfull testiment to the human spirit and the  humen heart. Watch this movie. You won't regret it.",964310400,7,795,4.150326797385621
1262584,4,B00003CWS2,"Don't watch this expecting Life Is Beautiful or Schindlers List - Don't watch it expecting to compare it to other Robin Williams Films.  Granted, it's not as realistic and the original German version but understand where  the film is coming from.  Read Jurek Beckers novel for more insight.  I'm  assuming this films takes from the novel (which is set in the Lodz ghetto  in Poland) - it's not a lavish detailed holocaust film but the message of  hope that is gained from this is great.  Watch the original German  production and read the book - then watch this version with an open mind.",962582400,25,588,4.631067961165049
1262585,1,B00003CWS2,"Robin Williams takes time off from hammy overacting and decides instead to bore us to tears with this trite melodrama. Phony to the core (it felt like a high school play rather than a realistic WWII setting), it lacked a  narrative flow and failed to generate any interest in the poorly drawn  characters. As said, it was refreshing to have Williams take a break from  his relentless mugging, but here he is so obviously employing a bad accent  that it is just as difficult to take him seriously. Scene after scene  passes before our eyes without drama or even a compelling reason to exist.  Moreover, the alleged hope that Jakob's radio ""reports"" was to  have inspired is neither demonstrated nor felt. And the ending? While it is  meant to be fantasy, it is difficult to imagine that the young girl had in  her memory an American jazz band complete with fashions she had never  witnessed. On what does she base this final delusion? Little makes sense  and when a film is this dry and lifeless, one is not inclined to figure it  out.",961113600,7,1034,4.590163934426229
1262586,2,B00003CWS2,"This remake of the 1974 film by the same name draws obvious comparisons to `Life is Beautiful', but it is a poor substitute in every regard. This film sometimes tries to be `Hogan's Hero's' in its farcical sendup of German  captivity and at other times it tries to be `Schindler's List' with  disturbing portrayals of the inhumanity of the holocaust. Unlike `Life is  Beautiful' which was a bittersweet story lovingly done, this story is  merely distasteful and makes a mockery of the plight of the Jews in  captivity during WWII. It portrays the citizens of the ghetto as bumbling  idiots with little regard for the gravity of their situation. A holocaust  story is no place for Keystone Cops comedy skits.
Director Peter  Kassovitz gives us nothing distinctive from a visual standpoint, nor does  he bring forth the proper tone and mood from the actors. The acting is  uniformly mediocre. Alan Arkin has given us numerous excellent  performances, but his character was so insubstantial and inane, it was  difficult for him not to look foolish. Liev Schreiber, as Mischa, made the  character into a complete buffoon (perhaps that is what Kassovitz  intended).
Finally, Robin Williams needs to seek career counseling. He  keeps taking these poignant comedic roles that are just not right for his  talents. He needs to realize his limitations and embrace his genius. He is  incomparable in frenetic, over the edge comedic roles that require quick  witted ad libs and shock comedy. As a serious actor he is simply  unexceptional and his attempts at such are especially disappointing when  compared against his true ability.
I rated this film a 4/10. If it was a  holocaust story that needed to be told, it certainly needed to be told  differently.",955929600,7,1745,4.965397923875432
