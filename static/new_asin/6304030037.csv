7861738,2,6304030037,"The inappropriately titled Wild Gals of the Naked West is one of the stranger films in the Russ Meyer canon. Filmed to look like a cartoon the film is one of Meyer's rare missteps. The biggest problem with the film is that it does not work either as broad comedy nor as a traditional nudie-cutie. The comedy veers into the inane and the women are not beautiful.

The film, told from the point of view of an old prospector (jack Moran) gives the story of why one particular western ghost town without a name died. Prior to the arrival of a stranger (Sammy Gilbert) on a burro, the town was like many others: lawlessness, fighting, women of loose virtues were the norm. There were problems with gunfights, Indians and  strangers were randomly killed in the Fallen Angel Saloon owned by Snake Wolf (Frank Bolger). With the arrival of the stranger things begin to change and the town goes from wickedness to goodness leading to its demise.

Shot in garish primary colors with extreme closeups the film is somewhat hard to follow. This is not helped by the fact that the transfer by Arrow Films is less than perfect. There are bad scratches on the print and the sound hisses and crackles more than any other Meyer film that I've seen. While the spoof of the American Western movie may have been a good idea in 1962 it looks terribly dated today. This is one for completists only.
