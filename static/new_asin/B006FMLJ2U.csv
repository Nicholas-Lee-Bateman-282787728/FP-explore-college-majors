8497096,5,B006FMLJ2U,"Great relaxation or sleep inducing video, or nice for anyone who just wants to recall winter camping ;)  Another review commented video is not as wanted, but I can't quite see the problem, as it is not only exactly as described, but exactly as shown in the cover picture.  The DVD runs a bit over an hour but auto-loops after that which really does make the peaceful fire flicker ""endlessly"" in a rock-lined pit dug in the snow.  The audio track is simply the fire crackling and the sound of the breeze; there is no music here.",1482710400,,527,4.412371134020619
