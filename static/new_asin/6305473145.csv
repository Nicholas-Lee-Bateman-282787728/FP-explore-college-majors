Recreations are fine when they are done well, but not in this movie. There some truly stunning shots of the falls, but they are too few and too brief. The real mystery of the falls is that Annie's cat, a small black kitten when it goes into the barrel, comes out of the barrel at the bottom of the falls as a larger and obviously older white cat- huh? Save your money!",1138147200,7,530,4.31
1033656,1,6305473145,This is a badly produced IMAX film. There is a tale with mediocre imaging and sound... what a waste of time and money!,1128211200,2,118,4.173913043478261
1033657,4,6305473145,"In the IMAX tradition, this is a beautiful presentation. I have seen Niagara-Miracles,Myths,& Magic at the IMAX theater in Niagara Falls and now own this spectacular film on DVD. Kieth Merrill admittedly stays true to his title and provides not only the spectacular and dramatic views of the falls and rapids below, but tells the story of the rich history of the region. It is an attempt to provide a snapshot of the region and its people in this well done film. Each tale unwinds a different, but significant part of the history that makes the Niagara so enchanting. The video transfer is average with quite a bit of film artifact, but this does not significantly detract from the overall picture. The audio is Dolby and well done, though somewhat less spectacular than other IMAX DVDs (MacGillivray features in particular). The 'Making of...' added feature is of fair video quality with much film artifact. The commentary is very brief by Merrill and does not add much to the overall featurette. My three most favorite sequences (all factually true) are the child over the falls, Miss Taylor over the falls, and the delivery of the steamboat down river(no models used in this one). Dramatic cinematography is used with carefully designed props and nice acting to make these events very realistic. I felt as if I have witnessed them for myself! This feature will be much better appreciated by those who have experienced some of Niagara for themselves, as no film will ever capture its scale and majesty. Newcomers will have a nice introduction to the beauty and hopefully will be able to experience the magic in person.",999043200,10,1620,4.8731884057971016
1033658,5,6305473145,"a little bit disappointed! But great sound!! I visited several times the niagara fall. I personally expected the scenery of the fall like an airview on a helicopter. but this film is mainly consists of several ""dramatized"" chapters. My mother never been to there, so I want to show her the beautiful sceneray, and what I expected was the realism of the scenary, but what a great mistake I made when I choose 'IMAX"" which has been destined to be 'a story teller' for kids in vacation season! Plus, it was taken pictured wholy from the American side of the great Niaagara fall. In short, never from the Canadian side of the fall!. What else should I say anymore. Still waiting for another great scenery dvd title, I am afraid that people do not convert just simple tourist video into new dvd tile which would be greatly popular.",966470400,,826,4.587837837837838
1033743,3,6305473145,"I was given the description that it was new and never opened. That was not the case; the package came looking like it had been droped in water. It wasn't sealed. I am still able to use the DVD, but even though the cost of the DVD was minimal, add the shipping and handeling and it is basically the same cost of a NEW DVD.",1397606400,,321,3.953846153846154
1033744,5,6305473145,This is definitely one of my favorite movies about Niagara Falls. It's the same movie they show on the tour.,1394064000,,108,4.45
1033745,5,6305473145,"How else can you go over the edge of Niagara falls.
It is awesome in IMAX but you have to go to Candada to see it in IMAX.",1378080000,,122,3.392857142857143
1033746,5,6305473145,"IMAX Presents ""Niagara: Miracles, Myths & Magic"" is appropriately named, because that is exactly what this DVD is about. I enjoyed watching it.",1375488000,,143,5.260869565217392
1033747,5,6305473145,"I liked this when I saw it in IMAX when I visited Niagara Falls years ago. It shows good recreations of historical events surrounding the falls, including daredevils and the earliest humans to live at Niagara Falls. Highly recommended.",1373155200,,235,5.051282051282051
1033748,4,6305473145,"I had seen the movie at the IMAX theatre in Niagara Falls, Canada and really liked it.  Consequently, I purchased the DVD in order to share the experience with others.  The DVD was great  --  the picture quality and the background sounds were outstanding.  The only shortcoming to the DVD was the narration.  The voice narration was not really not very clear or crisp  --  you could understand what was being said but the dialogue was not of the same quality as the background sounds.",1350345600,,484,4.6117647058823525
1033749,1,6305473145,"This movie is extremely bad. Do not buy it. I want to know is what the hell was the director thinking($$$). I myself could've done a better job. Black cat goes into the barrel & after the fall she turns white, must've been terrified from the fall & her hair turned all white. Don't insult people's intelligence, we are in America, not China or India. The guy walking on the rope across the falls looks so fake, you were better off just telling us about the guy's story and not show what he did. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. You will waste your money, I guarantee it. Stupid, Stupid movie. I'm hoping I can return this movie & get my money back.",1318464000,,638,4.237704918032787
1033750,4,6305473145,"We watched this feature at the Falls IMAX theatre and while short and limiting in its coverage was a great primer (both in setting the stage for the majesty of the falls and in giving you a little background) for actually experiencing the falls. My wife and I both found the soundtrack (by Conti) added a lot to the feature and we would like to buy it. Alas it does not seem to be in release. Can someone comment on this?

Oh, and by the way, everyone in the theatre got the fact that the cat, which had gone in the barrel black, got soo scared it had turned white in it's journey over the falls. It was greeted with laughter. You may think this was a poorly contrived gag, but it was not a continuity issue.",1209686400,2,708,4.1678832116788325
1033751,1,6305473145,"This video just glosses over the history of the falls and throws in some fluffy depictions to make people feel warm and fuzzy. I watched ""Niagara-A history of the Falls"" by the History Channel first which was 100 percent better than this DVD. Without the knowledge gained from watching this DVD first I would have not understood parts of the IMAX DVD.",1186531200,5,351,4.67741935483871
1033752,5,6305473145,"After seeing this movie on the IMAX screen, I just had to own it.  It's not the same, obviously, because of the size of my TV screen but it's still a good movie.",1171929600,,161,3.878787878787879
