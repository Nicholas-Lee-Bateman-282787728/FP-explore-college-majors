418471,5,6302033799,"This film is a real treat, as gives us an insight into the work of Picasso by literally allowing us to see the master at work and how his simple brush strokes incredibly evolve into masterpieces, in some instances even metamorphosing before our eyes from a figurative piece in to a cubist expression of the same.  This is a film that I was pleasantly surprised to see my 5-year-old son sit through shearing my amazement as Picasso worked for the camera.  It's a definite ""must have"" for those that like Picasso and who, after viewing this movie, will appreciate his work even more!",1063238400,15,581,4.631067961165049
418472,5,6302033799,A Fabulous film showing how an artist- in this case Picasso- takes a blank sheet of paper or canvas and transforms it into a work of art. Thru a special process that lets the inks bleed thru to the wrong side of the canvas where a camera captures  the developement of a drawing from the first placement of a brush stroke to the final completed drawing/painting. Sometimes it is truly amazing to see what comes forth from the humble beginnings.  We also are able to follow the developement of paintings as well with the aide of stop motion photography. I wish I were an art teacher so I could share this with my students! An enjoyable film for anyone with an interest in art!,1042588800,36,674,4.42741935483871
418473,5,6302033799,"I once saw this film on television, late at night. This was at least ten years ago, and despite having seen it only once, many of the images are still fresh in my mind. Along with Alex Cox's ""Vincent"", an extraordinary documentary about the life of Vincent Van Gogh, this is probably the best portrait of the work and life of an artist.

418475,4,6302033799,"This superb film allows us to see the transformation of Picasso's paintings as they are being made!  By placing the camera behind a specially designed ""canvas"" we are able to see each brush stroke and most importantly how a beautiful painting is created only to be painted over: adding a stroke here, changing a line, until the painting is transformed by layer upon layer of painting.

418650,5,6302033799,"This is a fascinating demonstration by Picasso of his creative ability and his working technique.  It is amazing to see how he begins a drawing or a painting at an improbable point, e.g. the upper left hand corner of the canvas, with a line which looks quite baffling at first, but which rapidly develops into a complete and intelligible picture.  His mastery of drawing is evident at every moment.  No erasing.  No shaky lines.  It is evident that he has a mental impression of the picture before he starts, so that the picture that emerges after that improbable start is correctly placed to fill the canvas.  And what a picture it is!  We have not one but many drawings created before our eyes. He also demonstrates his ability to change course as he works, as new ideas occur to him, totally transforming the work.  In a final scene, he virtually destroys and recreates a beach scene several times as he reveals this amazing talent.  It is astonishing to see how unerringly he can encapsulate an entire scene such a a bullfight with a few strokes of his brush.  Note how a few simple marks in the background convincingly denote a large crowd.  I found this entire performance absolutely captivating.

The filming technique is also masterful, so that the film is an artwork in itself.  The film is actually a record of what appears on the reverse side of Picasso's canvas as he works.  Picasso uses special inks that penetrate the canvas.  The viewer sees the picture developing without the presence of the artist.  During several breaks in the film, Picasso appears.

The film was made with a running commentary in French.  Two separate and different commentaries in English have been added, so one may choose any of three versions.  I have watched it several times with each of the English commentaries and have been well pleased with each.

The French government designated this film a National Treasure.  This accolade surely indicates its significance.
Who am I to gainsay what the French government thinks?  For me, The Mystery of Picasso is certainly a private treasure.  It is the best value for money that I have enjoyed for a long time.",1361664000,10,2148,4.761517615176151

418652,5,6302033799,"Anyone who cares about Picasso or is even slightly interested must watch this film. Picasso promises the viewer that she will be shown the mystery of Picasso and his art. This promise made by the master himself. He does not disappoint either because he takes us on a ride of a lifetime with one work after the other created before the viewers eyes. He allows himself to get into real trouble and to effectively ruin a work only to pull it out of the ashes and go on. Learning from each so called mistake. In this presentation on seeing, the real mistake is not learning about the patient work that painting requires. Picasso will encourage and inspire us all in a life changing way. A must see!

418654,5,6302033799,"This is an historic work of cinema.  In it, you get to see one of the most significant artists of all time in the act of creating.  As an artist, watching Picasso paint is mesmerizing - I've seen this video dozens of times and always see something new in his work. It is instructional - learn from it.  It is inspirational - grow from it. Some of the dialogue is scripted and the musical score is dated - I just mute the volume and play my own music - you want to watch this for the painting anyway.  The tortuous and creative process Picasso goes through on the last two pieces in the film is more than worth the small price of the DVD.

418716,5,6302033799,"Watch this with either of the two commentary tracks by art scholars and you will be even more rewarded than simply watching as Picasso transforms blank canvasses. Repeatedly, the artist takes risks that seem to wreck his work, but then recovers to reveal something even better. I learned a lot from the commentaries about how to watch Picasso create. Extremely enriching. Picasso is my favorite artist and I have read extensively about him and seen many of his most famed works in person in museums all over the US and in Paris and Barcelona. If you know Picasso, you will enjoy this 1955 film. The end features the voice of Picasso talking a bit with the filmmaker.",1294185600,,666,4.700854700854701

It's great to watch Picasso's genius at work, not something that can be seen very often. For the price that it is you could probably rent it and enjoy it, but I bought it and love it.",1230681600,4,443,4.261904761904762
418723,5,6302033799,"""The mystery of Picasso"" is one of these absorbing films that immediately engage you from the first shot. To watch Picasso in plain creative process, thanks to the admirable craft of Clouzot is not precisely an occasion to waste it.

This monumental and over the top film is an absolute must for cinema's lovers, art students and all kind of people.

The only aspect of the film I did not enjoy was the soundtrack.  It does not fit the action on screen and is sometimes unnecessarily loud.",1188950400,2,309,4.220338983050848
418725,5,6302033799,"This DVD is startling. It shows Picasso painting (by placing the camera behind the canvas). It shows him work through a painting, or dash through a painting, all with great glee. You can acutally see him make a decision, then change his mind, then change it again. I had no idea this is really how painters paint.

This won the Palm d'Or at the  Cannes Film Festival in the late 1950s.  It's easy to see why. I would love to watch it with a young child and then see what happens.",1181433600,,479,4.241758241758242
418766,5,6302033799,"This is a remarkable, swift, simple, beautiful, profound, fun and candid vision of the blank canvas turning into A Picasso. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot does just enough to infuse himself and the documentary presence of film, allowing the master to riff a couple dozen times. Simply watching the images appear and then evolve is a treat, scored with music. Picasso too brings some of himself to the film, but the dialogue is minimal, again focusing on the images he creates.
This is a very memorable work. It could succeed in a classroom for elementary, high school or even college students. It could play on a loop at a party. An artist could play and rewind a particular sequence, perhaps wanting to copy Picasso's brilliance.
Great.",1180137600,2,737,4.951612903225806
418767,5,6302033799,"A-one-of-a-kind look at the artistic process, the unique art documentary captures the creativity itself. Two friends, the great painter and the great director, Pablo Picasso and Henri-George Clouzot decided to do what Goethe's Faust had dreamed about - to capture and to store forever the moment of beauty and inspiration. Picasso conceives, sketches, and paints twenty canvases before our eyes as the camera rolls. The film did not solve the mystery of Picasso who had said about himself, ""When I was 9 years old, I could paint like Rafael; as an adult, all my life I tried to learn how to paint like a child"" but it lets us to be the eye-witnesses of the amazing process - the birth of twenty works of art into existence. Twenty exiting moments the only Artist could live through are captured forever for us to enjoy again and again. Clouzot uses a specially designed transparent 'canvas' to provide an unobstructed view and different techniques including slow motion animation to let the main character, the invisible Picasso's brush speak for itself. The film is accompanied by exquisite music and gorgeous photography by Claude Renoir, grandson of impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and nephew of Jean Renoir. The paintings created by Picasso in the film cannot be seen anywhere else. They were destroyed upon completion of the film. The French government has taken over the preservation of the original negative and has declared this truly unique and priceless documentary a national (and I would call it an international) treasure.

Criterion DVD also includes ""Guernica"", a short documentary directed in 1950 by Alain Resnais before any of his feature films. Picasso's ""Guernica"" is one of the most famous paintings of the 20th Century which was created by the artist in response to bombing and destroying the ancient Basque town of Guernica by German aviation on April 27 1937 during Spanish Civil War. The painting is a passionate protest against war as well as the fascinating work of art. Resnais' 13 minutes short film is based on paintings, drawings, and sculptures by Pablo Picasso from 1902 until 949 including ""Guernica"" and is set against the ode written by French lyrical poet Paul &Eacute;luard and recited by Jacques Pruvost and Mar&iacute;a Casar&egrave;s. In his early short film, Resnais already uses his famous jump cuts and cross-fades. ""Guernica"" is a valuable feature which goes well together with the marvelous ""The Mystery of Picasso"" and adds to understanding one of the most prolific and mysterious Artists of the last century.",1176508800,6,2568,5.128878281622912
418768,3,6302033799,"Historically worth watching to see a shirtless, smoking Picasso creating several spontaneous drawings and paintings on the fly. Starting from markers and moving up to oil paints the drawings and paintings vary from straight forward sketches to his more well known cubist style. Best if watched in fast forward. You still get the point but in half the time. The cover painting is shot  in a ten minute span but actually took five hours for Picasso to paint. The cubist paintings are fascinating to watch as Picasso starts with a sketch and morphs it into cubism, seemingly adding and subtracting layers in a random fashion. Interesting but ultimatley boring. Most of the paintings are crap and this is coming from a huge Picasso fan.  It makes sense that all twenty paintings were destroyed after the filming.

418770,3,6302033799,"The DVD was interesting. The ability of Picasso to look at the same concept in different ways was refreshing. However, my expectations were different considering the title of the feature and the picture on the cover. I had the impression that the DVD will include some sort of commentary by the artist himself revealing more about the thoughts that go on in his mind when he's in the process of painting.

Having said that, you get still to see some interesting order -or lack of it; depending on how you see it- of how Picasso paints different parts of the painting at one time and then revisit them repeatedly to complete the painting. I guess you can say he demonstrated his thoughts rather than narrating them, but that narration would've really pushed it to a solid 5 out 5.",1158883200,5,779,4.60431654676259

Picasso fue un artista fuera de serie, con una capacidad creativa asombrosa.

El rodaje del film fue un acierto mayusculo, pues captura el momento de la creacion dejandonos ver como aparece gradualmente la  imagen y se compone la obra.

Es un ejemplo excelente para entender no solamente la obra de Picasso, sino tambien de los artistas que comenzaron a alejarse de la imagen mimetica para proponer nuevos lenguajes en la representacion visual.

This is Picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist, not the edgy artist genius of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and Guernica.
