The disc is dubbed if you speak English, as Mr. Lahner's native language is German. This was not a problem to me, but may be for some. It is also dubbed in French. The disc is pretty short. You will not become a master of this sort of thing right off. But it will give some good basic principals and get you thinking in the right way. Then you can competently begin experimenting with other objects you are considering. Be careful and safe in your training, and you will go far.",1360022400,,573,4.314814814814815
