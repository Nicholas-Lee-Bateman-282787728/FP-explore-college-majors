8648446,5,B00J5MKVLC,"Rev turns out to be a smart series. No, it's not realistic in the sense that everything could have happened: it's not drama. What it does accomplish is show the human side of a well meaning character who, as it turns out, to be very human. Spoiler alert: the third series has a dark turn. Great supporting cast.  While the dvds are formatted for region 2, if you have a multi-region player, it's worth watching.",1496275200,,411,4.48
