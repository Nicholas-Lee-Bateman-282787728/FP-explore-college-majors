8424187,5,B004CZHBS8,"Surprised by how great the 1969 Mets film was, and how many of those 1969 players were interviewed for this (made around 1999).  Has lots of 1969 footage I hadn't seen before, and I saw nearly all games televised that year, like 120 or so.  Solid picture quality. Highly recommend that film.

The other film on Gil Hodges was simply too weak on his career and way too pushy as to, REPEATEDLY, mentioning how he should be in the Hall of Fame.  Wasn't really a Hall of Fame player or manager in my view, but even if he was, give it a rest already as to the number of times you push for it in the film's narration.  Tough to sit through this one.

Both seem to be made on DVD-Rs and NOT in the best picture-quality mode that would fit (by looking at the bottom surfaces of the discs and seeing all the unused space), but perhaps are in SP (standard-play) mode.",1433980800,,857,4.226993865030675
