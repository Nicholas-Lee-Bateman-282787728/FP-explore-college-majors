8513931,1,B007BM6QJE,"Tried this movie as suggested by an extreme horror enthusiast website.  Simply put: not extreme horror.  Not even really a story... Nothing happens for nearly the first hour... It sets up the characters (several teenagers) to rob an old woman's house of her legendary treasure.  45 minutes in they finally get into the house and another 15 minutes later things actually start happening.  I think the writer at some point realized this as well and sped through the last half hour which contained a few mildly graphic scenes on about the level of ""Saw""-style violence.  This would have made a ""meh""-rated movie, but between the beginning and the end, half a dozen side-stories are presented that receive absolutely no explanation and become just a distraction leaving a reverberating ""WTF"" in the audience's head by the time the credits start rolling.",1480291200,,849,5.035714285714286

8513934,2,B007BM6QJE,"Livide. The 2nd film from the directors of 2007's Inside. The most disgusting slasher movie ever made. Livide has a lot to live up to then, doesn't it?

Livide has great cinematography. And that's about it. The sets are creepy as hell, lighting extra dim, and the main starlet is 1 hot hooch. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close to capturing the filthy grandeur of the directors' last outing.

You will notice that this movie is a very intentional rip-off of Suspiria and everything Guillermo Del Torro. In comparison however, it's incredibly boring, slow, and lacks the artistic merit of Dario Argento's acclaimed masterpiece while adding nothing new to Del Torro's art house gags.

Inside could be compared to the pacing of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven."" It's slow to start, picks up gradually, and ends in a total bloodbath. Livide is similarly gory, yet doesn't make sense. The viewer is never quite sure what type of monster we are facing. Vampire? Demon? Witch? No clue is given.

I was bored 2/3 of the way into this flick and was even less impressed by the time the credits rolled.",1395273600,,1096,4.8138297872340425

8513936,4,B007BM6QJE,A fantasty full of blood and death and a unique take on vampires. The look of the film is stunning and I cannot wait to see what this team of directors do next.,1367971200,4,160,3.878787878787879
8513937,5,B007BM6QJE,"Yet again the French pull off another amazing horror movie, probably the best horror of 2012, a fantastic new take on the vampire genre from the same directors as the gore fest Inside, The story is great and has so many original elements and fantastic set pieces and a great cast, there are plenty of scare moments and creepy atmospheric music to accompany the scenes, as you expect there is plenty for gore hounds as the movie is a bloodbath near the end with some awesome gore effects and some cool creepy ghostly effects too, this is an awesome horror and must be seen, the bluray picture quality is very good and the disc does have some features too making it a great purchase, gem of a film.",1364169600,2,696,4.4453125
8513938,3,B007BM6QJE,"I was lucky enough to get a digital copy of ""Livid"", a french horror movie from the same team that brought us the outstanding horror film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Unrated/dp/B00125WATQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside (Unrated)</a>"". I really didn't know much about this film except of the directors and for me that was enough to give it a go. What I got from ""Livid"" was confused and unanswered questions though.

A young woman named Lucie who has heterochromia (two different color eyes) is starting her first day of in home care for the elderly with a veteran nurse named Catherine. She takes Lucie around to several different patients before they make their last stop at an old mansion where Catherine has Lucie stay in the car for this last visit. While waiting Lucie gets curious and decides to go in. She finds Catherine with an elderly woman in a coma, Catherine knew she would come and was actually waiting for Lucie. She starts to explain that the woman was a famous ballet dancer who lost her young daughter and that there was said to be a treasure of some sort hidden in the house.
Catherine tells Lucie she has looked all over but could never find anything. Later Lucie meets with her boyfriend who is a young fisherman and she tells him of the treasure at which time he starts concocting a plot to find it. Later that night along with a friend, a reluctant Lucie and her boyfriend break in and start their search for the treasure only to find that the riches they thought they'd find are something much more horrific.

I took this movie as a kind of haunted vampire film which I really wanted to love but sadly ended up only liking to an extent. It took almost an hour before it starting getting good and by the time it ending I was a little dissatisfied. Some events in the film were unanswered and left me wondering an scratching my head, I would say what but I really don't want to give anything away. The overall mood was eerie and creepy along with a fitting soundtrack of violins and piano which gave it a nice touch. The acting was good, no complaints except for the use of Beatrice Dalle (the menacing woman out for revenge from ""Inside"") who had all but two small cameos in the film. I thought her to be the main villain at first but was totally let down by her role.

It is a unique film with vampires, human automaton and revenge along with a few twists and a little gore that deserves at least a viewing or two. Overall its a beautiful film to watch and is interesting but starts off slow an leaves you a little confused with questions of why certain things happened by the end.",1351296000,2,2658,4.627118644067797
