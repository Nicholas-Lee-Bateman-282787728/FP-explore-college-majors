8145883,4,B000IHVGC6,"Long unavailable in English-language versions since Disney bought up the remake rights nearly 20 years ago, Francis Veber's Les Fugitifs has finally emerged on an English subtitled DVD in Australia (alongside La Chevre and Les Comperes). Reuniting Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu for the last time as a hopeless bank robber and the hardened criminal he takes as hostage during a botched hold-up only for the police to naturally assume Depardieu is the robber and Richard the hostage, it's not the strongest of their pairings. Curiously, neither star is at their best here and the film surprisingly misses a few comic opportunities that Veber would avail himself of in the for-once superior US remake, Three Fugitives (to date the only one of his films he remade himself). Indeed, second time round Nick Nolte got far more laughs as the straight man than Martin Short did in the Richard role. That said, it's still an enjoyable summer movie with a few inspired moments. Be warned that there are a few problems with the subtitling that even my poor command of French noticed, such as ""He WON'T call the cops"" somehow managing to turn into ""He WILL phone the cops"" at one point!

Les Comperes (remade as Father's Day) is easily the weakest of the three, a pleasant enough amble but not particularly funny and overly reliant on starpower to drive it. But perhaps the reason both seem a little disappointing is that their first teaming, La Chevre, is still so good. Richard's the idiot accountant assigned to find a missing girl in South America simply because he's every bit as accident-prone as she is, while Depardieu's the worldly private eye who has to pretend to be working for him while really running the case and trying to keep him out of trouble. You can pretty much fill in the gaps from there, but that doesn't make it any less funny. Richard's pratfalls work not just because they're unsensationally directed rather than heavily telegraphed (one even takes place out of focus in the background) but because, like Clouseau, Richard's character doesn't know he's a clumsy idiot. In fact, he thinks he's the epitome of cool and control. But it's Depardieu who really makes the film, his underplayed exasperation and beautiful reaction shots easily the funniest thing in the film, especially as he realises with increasing fatalism that Richard's bad luck is starting to rub off.

Extras are limited to trailers, but each PAL disc offers a good transfer with English subtitles.",1187481600,,2485,4.928400954653938
8145884,5,B000IHVGC6,"this great french movie classic was played by two great actors and the screenplay couldn't be better! very thrilling and suspenseful yet at the same time very coincidentally funny. if you want to know how a comedy is entitled to brand itself as a 'comedy', this is it.
great acting, directing and editing. a perfect ingredient mixture for being a real comedy. highly recommended.",1182211200,,379,4.9375
