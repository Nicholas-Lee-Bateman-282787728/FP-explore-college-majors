8711065,5,B00VSCA88S,This was so great I went out and bought the set absolutely loving it the man knows of what he says. So much propaganda anymore its refreshing to see actual historical accounts and quotes. The quotes given are often silenced by the masses now in the latest revisionist telling of history.,1525824000,,287,4.647058823529412
8711066,4,B00VSCA88S,LOTS OF FACTS but kind of boring. I was hoping this would be great for my daughter for extra homeschooling work but there is a lot of information,1523318400,,145,4.214285714285714
8711067,5,B00VSCA88S,This series is very informative. I like that he uses actual documents from History to teach. Its not based on opinions or an abridged version of a historical text to fit an agenda. Its just History told in truthfulness & he uses the documents from long ago to prove it.,1522195200,,269,4.4

8711072,2,B00VSCA88S,"Dissatisfied.  I have the series with the TV host from TBN! I liked it but I thought it was water down. This is ten times worse.  I watch Wall builders to hear and see the words of the founding fathers, great Christianity men who spread Christianity and ""liberated people"", Martin Luther, Willaim Penn, John Locke, Willaim Bradford, etc. and others in a collective way. The founding Fathers had the power of God that set the world on Fire along with the preachers of the day. This was a huge revival. To compare anything done today with them is absurd. This seemed more like ""we are just like you"" excuses to critics of the Christians faith.  That's the problem Christianity has been converted to the world, you just secularized Christianity. Real Christianity converted the entire globe! Live amongst the Amish for a while, you'll see more real Christianity like the founding fathers, John Locke, Issac Newton, etc. You know Christianity, you know history, you can show the word in their words but don't experience it yourself because you lack the ""power"" thereof.",1491091200,,1065,4.87292817679558
8711073,1,B00VSCA88S,"My Aunt had a copy of this and I decided to watch it. There are many inaccuracies in this representation and half truths. David Barton has an agenda and he is only interested in ""evidence"" that supports this agenda. Please, seek out actual historians who research with integrity and write about the evidence even if it doesn't fit their world view.",1490745600,,348,4.721311475409836
8711074,5,B00VSCA88S,"Acurate author, true historian",1490572800,,30,6.75
