4673855,5,B005FHM8N0,Shihan John McGraugh by far is one of the greatest instructors i have had the honor of training under in my 15 years of martial arts training.

8469918,5,B005FHM8N0,"I am a Rokudan in Isshinryu Karate Do, Shodan in Kodokan Judo and a Shodan in Musu Jikiden Eisshinryu Iaido and a student of  Iaijutsu.  The instruction by Shihan John McGraugh is well organized, proceeds in a well-layered set of lesson plans and allows me to keep up on moves which I have forgotten from my own training some years ago.  It is not my style, but the Japanese is the same and the moves are the same.  Outstanding training tape for all Iaido practitioners.

8469919,2,B005FHM8N0,"This seems like it's supposed to be part one of a multi part series, but instead it's about 35 minutes forms and traditional stuff, just to learn to do an overhead slice in the super specific style.  Maybe I'm just not impressed by the Japanese sword arts, sure they make some great weapons, but the way they use them is so dry compared to western martial sword arts.  So maybe this guy is great, but I was looking for something different, something to practice with my friends.

The first 55% of this movie is instruction on what to wear.  I've got a polypropelyne bokken and I'm watching a video; I'm hardly concerned with tradition here am I?",1362355200,5,645,4.487179487179487
8469920,5,B005FHM8N0,"I've practiced martial arts and self-defense for several years now and since I moved away from my dojo in CA and over to MO I haven't been able to yet find a dojo that suits my interests so I began searching for martial art videos that I could train with at home. After searching a little bit on google, I found myself on the sword guy website. [...] I checked it out and had to purchase this dvd immediately. The website is awesome looking and you can really tell someone put A LOT of effort into making it look great. The very same can be said about this dvd. It's done in such a way where anybody with any level of martial art experience can understand it clearly and the video quality is superb. Shihan John McGraugh is excellent at explaining techniques in laymen's terms that would otherwise be difficult to explain to some. To give a brief explanation of what it is included in this dvd, it is of course the first one in the series so this is an amazing introductory dvd for those of you interested in starting their study of the Japanese sword or if you are like myself and have had previous experience fencing then this will be a great overview. Shihan McGraugh teaches you; dojo ettiquete, warm-up stretches, safety precautions, and basic cutting techniques and the necessary footwork that goes hand-in-hand with them. Just last night I got off work and I popped this dvd into my computer and began to practice. I have to say, I really felt like I was back in CA training at my old dojo right from my room! Other then that, this video also includes special features that are helpful also when wanting to learn things such as;the history of Ryuseikan Batto-do, sword anatomy, target preparation, meditation tips and the making of. The bottom line is, if you're looking for a dvd that's going to teach you the basic fundamentals of wielding the katana, look no further! Get the dvd and practice, practice, practice and who knows maybe you'll prove yourself worthy of receiving a black belt. I know I'm going to be training with this dvd daily. Thank you for this fantastic dvd! Now I must go practice! OSS!",1349222400,6,2114,4.536649214659686
