2699908,5,B000L43KB6,"This DVD is the culmination of a solo comeback tour that Mr. Dolby has embarked upon this past year.  In reconnecting with his fan base, he has revisited his earliest solo material, revising and revamping it for the 21st century (with the aid of some Cold War era machinery).  The performances are passionate and heart-warming, and watching Dolby construct each song from scratch with his arsenal of gear on stage is a great treat.

The extras also make this a must-have for Dolby fans.  The interview from his 'shed' is a 1/2 hour of great insights into the background on his songs, philosophies, and life, presented in such a way that it feels like he is in your living room, chatting you up.

Great fun!",1165276800,4,706,4.616
2699909,5,B000L43KB6,"If the only song you know by Thomas Dolby is called ""She Blinded Me With Science"", no offense, but you don't know Thomas Dolby. I bought his first LP, The Golden Age of Wireless, on vinyl back in 1983 and have been hooked ever since.

The Sole Inhabitant marks the return of one of my all-time favorite songwriters after a 12-year absence. Dolby performs stripped-down versions of some of his best work using an array of state-of-the-art, classic, and homegrown MIDI controllers. Highlights include surprisingly moving performances of ""Leipzig"" and ""Flying North"", plus a personal favorite of mine, ""The Flat Earth"".

Thomas Dolby has always been able to project warm, emotional songs against a genre of music that is often cold and aloof. So, what are you waiting for?  The Sole Inhabitant DVD is truly ""poetry in motion"".",1165276800,4,823,4.949275362318841
2699910,4,B000L43KB6,I just can't believe how good this product is!  Just had the concert in September and now it's in my happy hands!  Thanks Thomas for returning to the scene... Keep it up!,1165276800,2,170,4.28125
2699911,5,B000L43KB6,"Buy this stunning DVD if you have even remote interest in any of the following: Music, Art, Science, History, Film, Love, Innovation, Poetry, Passion, ...in a word, Life. For anyone with an ear for music Thomas Dolby has been serving lush gardens of beauty both intimate and vast, sublime compositions both sensitive and flamboyant, melodies both haunting and catchy, lyrics both erotic and intellectual, creating monuments of artistic achievement in an all too barren landscape. Can this be the same man who gave the world ""She Blinded Me with Science""? As even that beacon of pop belies by the time you reach the chorus, someone who can equate the sway of a woman's body with ""Poetry in Motion"" is a man who thinks with the whole person, not just the mind, but the body, the soul, or as Mark Twain would say ""the heart."" If you've ever been in love you should know what I mean.

The DVD opens with a tune about  a dispossessed east German finding both liberation and disappointment outside of the iron curtain. Not only do you get a sense of the irony which frames Dolby's perspective but you get to glimpse his mastery of an all new electronic array which,  as he quipped on a recent tour of the US, ""was steam powered"" when he started making music. Ironically, his ability to give sound a human and even primal feel instantly helps you forget that he is orchestrating and crafting this very warm sonic landscape by sequencing together a dazzling bank of machines, voices, samples, recordings and images. The fact that he arrives on stage dressed to resemble the Matrix's Morpheus is probably no accident. And then things get weird. A video montage of searchlights raking across a snow storm, a nighttime time lapse of the Arc de Triomphe, stone eagle wings from Brandenburg Gate and the like showcases not only Dolby's penchant for packaging visual interpretations of his music for the television society, but serves as a reminder that he was indeed one of its pioneers who exploited its power back in the infancy of MTV. For those who haven't seen his new concerts this is a pretty faithful rendition of what happens there. An immensely creative ""VJ"" named Johny Dekam is credited not only with bringing this vision to the stage, but producing the DVD. Visually and sonically, this is a multifaceted work of art. Its slick production values in both camps makes it hard to believe that this is a live recording. Like the concerts, it's phonically perfect.

Follow this with a whirlwind tour of his superstar years which could well be the soundtrack for those who perceive both the beauty and the pathos of modern life, its joys, disillusionment, lust, isolation and quirkiness. Set this to a danceable beat and you have a synthesis of improbable pairs that defines this state-of-the-art commentary about popular culture from the man who helped build it. He is an influence which spans generations, musical genres and mindsets. I've watched this DVD eight times since I've received it and find something new each time. How many works in your collection can you say that about? Buy two, one for yourself and one for someone you care about. Thomas Dolby is back to the glee of fans, musicians, artists, scientists, poets, historians, inventors, children at heart, hopeless romantics and anybody else who's ever been in love.",1165190400,3,3325,4.838312829525483
2699912,5,B000L43KB6,"Thomas Dolby's music has, for me, as for many of his fans, been a soundtrack for most of my life; through my happy moments, and sad ones, I've always found a song where it seems like Mr. Dolby knew exactly how I was feeling, and wrote a song just for me. The depth and intricate layers of his music are such that I can close my eyes, and I'm taken away to another place; from the subtle banjo background of ""I Love You Goodbye"" on 'Astronauts and Heretics', to the uptempo driving hammer of 'Gate To The Minds Eye's ""Quantum Mechanic"".

Watching this DVD, though, I didn't want to close my eyes, because I was being taken to another dimension right there on screen; with Thomas at the helm, powering the voyage with an adept tweaking of knobs and a very real, sometimes imperfect, but always beautiful voice. His new spins and experimentations on old songs make them seem fresh and new again; this disc is a delight to both eye and ear; For long time fans, it gives new insight, depth, and humanity to an artist we all thought we already knew. For a newcomer to Dolby's music, storytelling, and friendly, charismatic persona, it is a wonderful introduction. Old fan or new, buy this DVD, you will enjoy it; a musically deep, visually beautiful, very up close and personal voyage with Thomas Dolby.",1165190400,2,1297,4.542735042735043

8160119,4,B000L43KB6,"... or, at the very least, find it interesting.  Dolby made a number of Top 40 hits in the late 80's (She Blinded Me With Schience, Hyperactive), made a few bucks, got totally fed up with the corporate aspect of the music business, and dropped out of the public eye.  His few (four is the number, I think) studio albums are much beloved by the cult following that has survived in his wake.

Well, now he's On His Way Back.  The concert recorded and nicely documented in this video was the evening half of a day-night doubleheader at the Berklee School of Music in Boston, MA, in the fall of 2006.  As an extension of his daytime clinic with Berklee students, his evening performance provides fascinating insights into how he goes about writing, producing, and performing his odd, evocative, often industrial-sounding music.

This is a solo act all the way.  Except for the video guru who mans a camera and the projection gear (great footage projected on a screen in the hall is nicely intercut in the edit to really enhance the music and life-behind-the-music scenes from Dolby's life that inspire his work), and an occasional roadie, it's one man, a heap of electronic gear, all of which Dolby explains lovingly at some point during the show or on one of the interesting addead features on the disc.

I've always loved his music, so I'm not the cherished unbiased observer.  The individual songs, while not many in number, are quality nuggets of pure-est and pur-ist Dolby.  He's quirky -- no lie -- how else do you explain a wildly overproportioned military trenchcoat and aviator goggles worn atop his shaved head? -- but it's OK.  What you get is in a sense a love-in between an artist and his appreciative fans.

Good news is delivered during the concert.  Dolby allows that he's influenced the music business enough during his absence to be inspired to write new stuff and distribute it ""soon.""  I got the impression that we should look for a new studio (I hope, I hope) album in 2007.  I hope that's all true, becuase the only thing better to a Dolby fan than TD on stage alone is TD on disc with a host of talented studio musicians making a joyful noise (check out his ""Astronauts and Heretics"" effort if you're as yet not a believer).

I've played this DVD twice on my home theater rig and watched it once more on my iPod.  It worked in both formats.",1176163200,7,2359,4.578571428571428
8160120,5,B000L43KB6,wow  Dolby is the most amazing solo musician and i think he is having fun as well  Buy it,1173312000,3,89,3.6315789473684212
8160121,5,B000L43KB6,"I've been a fan of TD for years, and I was thrilled to see him do a one man show like this.  Being a keyboard fan, I was particularly impressed with the extras where he goes through his rig and shows what equipment he uses and why.  This was filmed at Berkley where he was giving a seminar on electronic music, so alot of the extra material is stuff he did for the seminar.  Excellent quality, and he does a great job with this.",1172102400,2,428,4.071428571428571
8160122,4,B000L43KB6,"He pulls off a good show with a deck of computers and machines.

The show is well shot, and it sounds good.

Sure, maybe some more projection screen(s), lights, monkeys, special effects, etc could be included.  I still enjoyed it.  But what I would like to see is a really great percussionist on stage.  Maybe two.  That could be powerful.",1171238400,2,339,4.566666666666666
8160123,5,B000L43KB6,"This was written about a live show, but it fits just as well for this DVD of the live show, too, so there you go.  How was the show? Well, in a word -- amazing.

Dolby was the only performer on stage during his set (aside from a couple techs to take care of the video aspect) -- which isn't too terribly unusual, except that nothing was canned. Most folks would just play with a laptop now, doing the basic backing tracks while they play the lead instrument and sing, and back in the day, it was the same thing, only with a reel-to-reel. (There's an amusing story of one early They Might Be Giants show where a reel unspooled and their manager had to go into the audience and collect the meters of tape while the Johns sort of screwed around dumbfounded.)

This might be good enough for most people.... but NOT Thomas Dolby. For every song, he built them live! He first laid down the drum tracks and looped it, then did his bass riffs, looped that, any other riffs that needed to be looped (keep in mind, this is all in time to where they'd come in on the song as well), and then when that was done, he'd play the lead and sing.

As if that weren't enough, he had a special headset on -- headphones for monitors, a microphone and vocoder included, and, best of all, a small video camera attached to the side of his head, so we could see what he saw. He used this to great effect -- showing us how he built a couple of songs from the ground up. (If you're curious, they were ""The Flat Earth"", which he didn't sing, sadly, and ""Hyperactive!"" which he did sing, and I didn't realize was so complex with the various layers of bass and drums going on.)

Perhaps the best thing about Thomas Dolby is his incredbily infectious enthusiasm about, well, everything. He genuinely is interested in everything and wants to share it with the world -- not to make him feel like the Holder Of All Knowledge (though he basically IS -- dude owned the company and helped develop the software that allows polyphonic ringtones, man), but because -- and this is the part that I just dig -- this stuff is NEAT. His army of really cool synth toys (his word!) are COOL. They're really interesting, but more over, they're just NEAT. The solar satellites that send information back to Earth about the gases being emitted from the sun? That's NEAT -- and it's EVEN COOLER that it sends it back in a 3-D image! How cool is that?! We're finding out about stuff that's 93 million miles away, and not only that, but it comes in a cool, green 3-D cartoon! That's so neat that Thomas Dolby took that data and converted them into sounds on his synthesizer... which he used in that night's version of ""Windpower"". How cool is that?

The other great thing is that Dolby seemed genuinely taken aback by the overwhelming positive response by the crowd, who knew all the songs and wanted as much as he could give us. The encore was great -- he said he didn't actually have any other songs worked out, but he'd play around... and out of the ""Hyperactive!"" sample-set, he built ""Airhead"", and I'm pretty sure he wasn't kidding when he said he was just fooling around and didn't have anything like that planned.

It's always great to see a show where the performer's doing it because they WANT to, not because they HAVE to. Thomas Dolby didn't HAVE to go out on tour -- he doesn't need the money, he doesn't have a new record out, nothing. He just WANTED to because he enjoys performing. And that really comes across -- he was having fun, playing his music in new arrangements, sharing information with the crowd, and just coming off as a genuinely personably, brilliant, fun, nice guy. He strikes me as just the kind of person it'd be great to know -- just sit and talk with him. He's got that infectious curiosity and brilliance that just makes him a joy to listen to and it's easy to come away knowing exactly what he's talking about, no matter how big it is, be it audio software, new synthesizers, or orbiting balls of machinery in close proximity to the sun. (I suppose I could invoke Richard Feynman here, since he seemed to have a similar skill set when it came to being excited about science and knowledge and sharing it with everyone just for the sake of ""Hey, lookit this cool thing! Isn't it cool?!"")

If you're not in Seattle, and if Thomas Dolby is coming to your town -- you MUST go.

If you're in Seattle and you missed this, the next time he comes around -- you have no excuse. In fact, I would recommend perhaps looking at the tourdates and seeing if there's another show you can make it to. Even if you have to fly somewhere.

It's worth it.

In the meantime, you can get this DVD (and corresponding CD) and watch it over and over.",1165968000,13,4707,4.380297823596793
8160124,5,B000L43KB6,"This DVD is great. If you're a long-time Thomas Dolby fan, you'll appreciate the retrocpectives included on the disc, as well as the little variations on old favorites (Hyperactive! is my favorite).

The DVD also has some interviews with Mr. Dolby where he explains how he builds his music, and shows you what equipment he has used / uses today, and how it all works.

A terrific buy.",1165276800,3,384,4.632352941176471
8160125,5,B000L43KB6,"For those of you who have painted a small part of your life on the canvas of Thomas Dolby's music, this is a must have DVD.  I was fortunate enough to see one of his Chicago performances in May of 2006 and, personally, I feel the show I saw was more compelling than what is captured on the DVD.  At the same time, the camera work must be better here.  And it's still very good, just a little less warm.

I believe Dolby has a kind of genius...and really stands head and shoulders over most of his contemporaries.  I lump him in my mind with my all time favorites, including Eno, Kraftwerk, Jan Hammer (pre Miami Vice) and others.  True, he does not have the chops of a Jan Hammer, but he's a better composer...a real masterful composer.  And the details he includes in some of his mixes remind me quite a bit of Eno - the more organic, ethereal elements.

Anwyay, on this DVD I most enjoyed the interview with Dolby.  I found it very heartwarming and fascinating.  It's rare to gain this kind of insight into how an artist views himself in the eyes of his fans.  Naturally, for those of us who appreciate his body of music - not just She Blinded Me with Science - we assumed, I think, that he knows how important he is to us and how much he's appreciated.  But that was evidently not the case...he seemed not to know where he stood, especially with his UK fans.  Dolby comes across as very humble and human.

Anyway, he played a significant role in forming that part of me which is a musician.  And his lyric, ""turn off your mind and let the heart decide who you were meant to be"" has played an increasingly important role in making me happy and having the courage to make some big changes in my life.  (May sound sappy to you, but it's true.)

Thomas Dolby, thank you for doing what you do.  You are a gift that I hope others will discover.  Glad you are doing music again...much better than the briefcase and suit.  Keep going.  Don't stop.  The earth is flat.",1165276800,7,1962,4.2888283378746594
