8242069,4,B0011NVC5M,"Sukeban Deka (Delinquent Schoolgirl) was a popular TV show in japan in the mid 80s. First staring Yuki Saito (Saki Asamiya), after her leaving the series the first season to pursue her singing carrier. New Idol and singer Yoko Miniamino ""Nano"" starring role came on the scene in Sukeban Deka 2 in late 1985. The movie starting Nano and the rest of her idol buddies are back! And ready to take on the bad guys! A few extras and subtitled! So if you love Japan and their idols in the 80s? Its worth adding this to your collection.",1518566400,,528,4.3979591836734695

8242072,3,B0011NVC5M,"If Yuki Saito were the lead for the first movie, it might have been better.  But Sukeban Deka the Movie follows the second delinquent detective with actress Yoko Minamino as the lead.  Like Sukeban Deka II the TV series, she just can't hold a candle to Yuki's original performance in the first live action TV series.  As for detective work, both movies have zero.  They both are fighting huge super hero like battles that should be beyond the character's abilities to do.  (They literally fight armies).  I get that a movie needs to be bigger, but both films are just an excuse for an action film with the Sukeban Deka name attached to it.  There literally is no reason for either Yui Asaka (SDIII) and Yoko to be wearing their school uniforms.

As for the films themselves, the first one has the better plot and action.  It's Yoko that brings it down.  Physically she's probably the best Sukeban in terms of fighting, but she doesn't have the acting range that Yuki and Yui have.  When a large part of the film requires Yoko to act, it can drag.  The second film, starring Yui Asaka, fairs better acting wise.  BUT the story is complete garbage and the action is really poorly edited, making Yui look completely awful.

That being said, if you're a fan of the Sukeban Deka TV series' then you'll like this.  These take place after Sukeban Deka II and Sukeban Deka III respectively.  They are movies and don't feel like the shows they represent, but whatever.  It's nice to see them.  The best Sukeban Deka movie is Aya Matsuura's 2006 film.  If you haven't gotten that (English name Yo-Yo Girl Cop), get it.  It accurately represents the Yuki Saito's era of the series, even if it gets a bit cheesy at the end.",1466726400,,1711,4.547540983606558

8242076,4,B0011NVC5M,"I have been learning about the wonderful Japanese female idols from the 80's and I was thrilled to find these DVDs here in the US Amazon and with English language subtitles. The plots are different and was surprised many times. It may be better if you watch it with an open mind since the fights are a bit hard to believe as they involve very young girls against big guys. I am very grateful they included the ""Making of"" documentaries, they are a wonderful, sweet experience for J-Idols fans as you learn what they go through making the movie and living their lives as music (and more) celebrities.
I wish we get more 80's J-Idols' videos!",1334966400,4,640,4.525862068965517
