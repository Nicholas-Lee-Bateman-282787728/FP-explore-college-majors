1964366,3,B0000ZG0A4,"I would have to agree with the last review for this item.
yeah, it's great that Yugi comes in this box set for the first season - but 4Kids Entertainment needs a good kick in the teeth!
If you're confused - here's  the low-down:
As far as I know 4Kids Entertainment is the company that made the english over-dub for this anime, they are also in charge of the visual editing aspect of the show.
Here's the problem with the english visual edit and the english over-dub:
In one ep of the show, Tristan (excuse the spelling) punches Joey and Joey hits the ground - that's the original Japanese version.
The english version goes like this:
The animation of Tristan punching Joey has been taken out (edit) and all we see is the animation of Joey on the ground.
Joey's lines then go something like this: ""Ow! Why'd ya ""shove"" me for?!"" - when in the animation Joey has a big punch mark on his face for all to see.
I think these edits are because cencorship changes every year so somethings CAN be said or shown on TV and somethings can't.
In my opinion - the english voices ain't so bad.
I Like Yami-Yugi's voice.
Just on a side note - some more differences between the Japanese and English versions:
No 1: The Dark Magician is called The Black Magician is the Japanese version.
The orginal Japanese name makes alot more sense when the dark magician becomes The Black Chaos Magician or The Magician of Black Chaos - whichever.
No 2: As far as I know - I could be wrong - but in the Japanese version Merick's name is Malick - I don't know why 4Kids changed his name - I think it's down to a bad translation on their part.
No 3: Tristan's real name is Honda, Ta's real name is something else and the name of Joey's sister is something completely differant.
No 4: If you may not know the name ""YUGI"" is the Japanese word for game or amusement and the name ""YAMI"" means darkness.
So the name ""Yami-Yugi"" means ""Dark-Game"" or The Shadow Games in the show. Cool, huh?
Ok, so all up - it's good that you can buy the season 1 box-set in english.
But, if you can get your hands on the original Japanese un-edited version with GOOD english sub-titles - I say go for it!

1964367,1,B0000ZG0A4,"Okay, let's take a look at the pros and cons of this box set:
Pros:
* Contains 49 episodes over 16 DVDs.
Cons:
* Far from Uncut.
* Only includes the Edited English version as seen on Kids' WB!
* The voices... well, to be blunt, SUCK.
* The translation... if you can even call it a ""translation""... is completely off and doesn't capture any spirit of the original Japanese version.
* The music is synthesized bullcrap equivalent to toddler's xialaphones (however it's spelled).
* Nearly every frame is censored, due to the original cards having... OMG teh japanees wryting!!!
4Kids took this show and completely blowed it out of proportion. If you like Yugioh, or even the dub, don't buy this set. You're much better off buying the R2 sets [...] or taping the episodes off of Kids' WB!, Cartoon Network, YTV, etc.
Don't support these DVDs until 4Kids gets the gall to release an Uncut version.",1080864000,5,892,4.651898734177215

1964397,4,B0000ZG0A4,"YuGiOh: Season One is your first look into the world of duel monsters & their linkage to the ancient Egyptian games; aka the Shadow Games. The storyline for this season of the YuGiOh anime series focuses around the interactions between a boy named Yugi Muto & the ancient Pharaoh whom lives within this Millennium Puzzle. With this mysterious item around Yugi's neck, Yugi must participate in a Duelist Kingdom tournament to rescue his (Sorry, cannot tell you) from the (Don't want to spoil it for you). The plot is epic in action & adventure with the pacing of the plot well developed so the viewer does not lose track of all of the action-filled scenes, especially for viewers whom are novices to the game mechanics of duel monsters.
The voice acting is acceptable in conveying the personalities of the characters, but needs some improvement to make the characters more lively & realistic such as gesture & tone of voice. The dialogue is straight forward & simple to understand since the comedic portion of the dialogue has to be intact to break any tension that builds up during the progression of the storyline.
I recommend this anime series to fans of the YuGiOh franchise but an optional anime series for anime fans. 4Kids did a lot of edits to this anime series making it less authentic to Japan.

But honestly, I haven't actually watched any of the DVDs. I've seen the shows from the Saturday morning airings, so I know the story.

1964411,3,B0000ZG0A4,"Yu-gi-oh Season 1 is very good for a number of reasons, including shorter duels, many villains and a very odd antagonist.

Unfortunately, the season's duels include more cons, than pros. There is a long list of cheating in this season, including no tributes, no damage, playing against card effects and using card effects wrong. Some of these cheats are used in Battle City arc. and the Orichalcos arc., but season 1 includes the most, 'bending of rules'.

This season, however, has shorter duels than seasons 2-5 due to less side talking. This is a good thing, because you can see more plays, and a bad thing because the whole tournament is over in 36 episodes. The Battle City Tournament was on for 75 episodes (see my review for Yu-gi-oh Season 2).

So Season 1 has pros and cons, but it gets a three out of five because there are many things in this series that may anger some deep fans of Yu-gi-oh.",1206835200,,903,4.561728395061729

In the first season Yugi becomes completly possessed by the spirit and exacts violent and painful vengence on people for thier crimes against humanity.

1964416,3,B0000ZG0A4,"Yu-Gi-Oh, like any other show, is always subject to a difference of opinion. I personally liked the series (although admittedly it is not the best) however it does have some serious flaws.

1. The dubbed 4kids version has painted out any guns that the characters might be holding. Instead they are replaced by the person's own finger (ohh fear the almighty index finger...) which is a really dumb thing to edit out (even if it was made kid friendly).

2. All character background stories (with a few exceptions)have been edited out or changed (changes include Alister's little bro being captured instead of killed. This change makes Alister's behavior seem seriously irrational. Not that he was in the right to begin with but it emphasizes my point). These kinds of changes really make the story line suck and is probably one of the reasons for some of the bad reviews. Apparently 4kids saw the character's history as an interferrance to their card selling gimik.

3. The series focuses too heavily on the card game. They could have done alot with the storyline that was given to them and so in direct comparision to the manga the anime sucks royally.

  I was asked repeatedly by alot of my friends why I watched such a ""crappy"" anime and I pretty much told them it was because the characters intrigued me. Some of them had rather interesting personalities and motivations that were never really addressed in the show for various reasons. You kinda have to look hard sometimes to find it but if you look past the whole ""the world will end if I can't win this card game"" aspect of the show it's actually halfway decent. not the best, but certainly watchable.

If you like shows like Poke'mon then you might liked the dubbed version of Yu-Gi-Oh. But if you're a hard core anime fan you probably won't since the animation and story are somewhat lacking . Like the title of my review says this anime is not for everyone.",1152230400,5,1917,4.670623145400594

In my opinion if you love card games and anime you will like this, btw it gets so much better in the later series as they take on the real rules of yugioh card game.  I can't wait till they bring out season 2,3,4 on box set.  seeya later",1145923200,3,419,3.6741573033707864

1964429,1,B0000ZG0A4,"Yu Gi Oh is lame!
A weak show with no character development or intrigue.
 The card game is well developed too bad we can't say the same about the characters. They didn't hire animators they hired doodlers. That's how cheap Yu Gi Oh! is animation wise. All the drama for this piece of crap comes off as cornball instead of dramatic. This abomination has a sequel Yu Gi Oh! GX! However well drawn this show may be, the suck factor is high!

So say pee yew to Yu Gi Oh!",1133654400,2,466,4.166666666666667
1964440,4,B0000ZG0A4,"Yu Gi Oh sadly has the Pokemon curse in that people who know nothing about it either assume it's for little kids (as marketing scams to buy cards, video games, and countless other garbage) or just hate it because it's the current fad.

What they fail to realize is that the series is actually action packed, entertaining, dramatic, and overall a high quality series.

What Yu Gi Oh is about is a young boy named Yugi after solving a millenium puzzle awakens an ancient Pharoh who is known as Yami.  One day his grandfather (who runs a game shop) shows off to Yugi and his friends an incredibly rare card, the Blue Eyes White Dragon.  Kaiba finds out and immediatly tries to buy it from him (despite the fact that he already has three of them).  His Grandfather refues and eventually it leads to Yugi and Kabais first duel.  Shortly there after the creator of Duel Monsters Pegasus steals Yugis Grandfathers soul as bait for him to go to Duelist Kingdom.  From there Yugi along with his friends must quest to get his Grandfathers soul back.

The series like I said is action packed, funny, and dramatic.  It should be noted that the series was origionally not for kids but 4kids did a decent job of marketing towards the younger audience (because truthfully the series would have died if they did not, there still is not that strong of an anime market for this).  The series is fun to watch and it is very well written.  I look at it this way with any anime series, if it lasts more than one season than they have done something right.  Yu Gi Oh is an example of an anime series (on both shores) done right.  In truth this ranks in there with Dragon Ball Z, Tenchi Muyo, and although I am not a fan of the last, Sailor Moon in terms of longevity.  It lasted a number of seasons, so something was done right.  It may never beat out Pokemon (because that one has better games) but in terms of a series, this is probably one of the best in terms of all ages out there right now (maybe that will get american cartoon makers off their --- and come up with something new and fresh).",1099958400,45,2075,4.353246753246753

The voice actors for Yami Yugi and Joey are pretty cool too!  I can't wait for the Complete Second season!",1096848000,5,351,4.257575757575758
1964464,5,B0000ZG0A4,"Ok first off I'm 21 and female. As you may have noticed by some of the other reviews that not just kids watch the show. Teens and young adults watch the Yu Gi Oh as well. Most of them watch the UNCUT version. Yes there is a UNCUT version of Yu Gi Oh, but as you have noticed Kids WB, 4 Kids, and Funimation EDITED the show making it for kids to watch.

Ok I personally have watched the EDITED English version. And I must say that yes it is a good series for your kids to watch. It has a wonderful storyline with lots of interesting characters, and lots of duels( basing around the Yu Gi Oh card game). Lots of mystery is also added to this series.

I don't actually have the dvd box set. But I do have the whole first season in separate volumes. (Which was a mistake that I did cuz now I have all these volumes everywhere in my room)

Anyways I give this a 5 star rating.

Now also as a reminder to the teens and adults- 4 Kids and Funimation is in the process of making Yu Gi Oh UNCUT. And the first volumes should be out sometime this fall. So keep an eye out!

I personally will collect both versions of the show. Not just that but because I have already seen the show UNCUT in JAPANESE  up to episode 205. So I know what's going on in Japan. And just to let everyone know that the series is almost over and should end around 225.

Also what I don't understand is how 4 Kids and Funimation will EDIT the future seasons. As because the final season gets very dark and lots of vilience. They might just discontinue it and that maybe why they are going ahead and doing a UNCUT version. This is just my opinion though.

Most of my fellow teenage friends love Yu-Gi-Oh as well. So hah to that you stereotypes. Ah-hem. Anyway, I think that Yu-Gi-Oh is an awesome show. Once you start watching it you can't pull your eyes away from the screen and end up spilling your diet coke all over yourself when you try to take a sip. -_- Heh. When the episode ends my jaw drops because I want to keep watching to find out what happens next! I think that Yu-Gi-Oh is more appreciated by older children, and in my case teens. The voice-overs are done well and the design of the creatures just blows my mind. Even though the characters tend to be serious, Joey is always making me laugh.  This is a great series.

1964466,5,B0000ZG0A4,"Ah, the first season of YGO. It came and went like, well, something fast and slow at the same time (which doesn't make much sense but bare with me). First of all, I would like to say how old I am: 14. What's this? A 14 year old (male, might I add) that likes YGO? He must be a total LOSER! Well let me give you a little history of YGO (quite little, actually, I don't feel like researching a tv show; if you want to, be my guest). Well, anyways, YGO was invented by Kazuki Takahashi in 1996 or '97. It was originally a manga series (for those not so up-to-date with Japanese terms, these are Japanese comics). The comics were intended for teens-adults, and was quite a success over-seas, so Kazuki decided to make it an anime series (if you don't know what anime is, you are either browsing through the wrong items, or a parent shopping for their child for YGO stuff). And I just wanted to mention that you can find YGO comics by reading Shonen Jump graphic novels. The anime series had a dark theme to it, involving sending someone into complete insanity by usage of a ""penalty game"". Anyways, this is now reffered to as ""season 0"", because it never aired in America. The card game was then played, and was a major hit in Japan, so America decided to pick it up and gave the show to Kid's WB for the U.S. airing. THIS WAS A MISTAKE! Kid's WB slaughtered it with so many edits that a very cool show for teens and adults in Japan became a child's show in America. Obviously, Kid's WB wanted a younger audience, so they took out the curse words, the guns, violence, and occasional nudity (mostly cleavage, though).
 So now, children in America go ga-ga for YGO merchandise, and some teens pick-up on it also. Apparently, word got out to jerks that YGO was very childish and whenever someone mentioned that they watched YGO, people look away in disgust. THIS IS WHY I AM NEARLY FORCED TO HIDE THE FACT THAT I WATCH YGO AND LOVE IT! Had Kid's WB kept it the way it was, it would not be considered childish and would be a very, very cool show.
 But now to the actual review of the product you have taken your time to look at. This particular DVD is a complete set of the first season of YGO (starting with the first American episode, Heart of the Cards, and ending with Dungeon Dice Monsters). It is, of course, the English version, so all you parents out there don't have to worry about little Timmy seeing any of Dark Magician Girl's breasts (BTW, for anyone who didn't already know, they are releasing uncut volumes of the first season sometime soon so you CAN see DMG's breasts, but that is not what I am reviewing now).
 If you haven't purchased any other YGO DVDs, and plan on getting some, save your money and buy this box set. I would like to purchase this item, but have alreasy purchased some volumes of the first season, so I fear I would lose money, but maybe I'll buy it anyway, seeing as it is a very good deal. (...).
 If you like YGO, this is a must-buy. If you don't really know what YGO is (which I don't see being possible, you either love it or hate it), then think about buying this, it is a very fun series.
 Well, that's about all I have to say about YGO season 1. Oh, and my name isn't Fay, it's Derek. I just have to use my mom's account since I don't have one.",1090713600,6,3281,4.260032102728732

Basicaly, it was the same thing 4 kids is doing but it cost 49.00 aND is just as good animation as the domestic dvd's sold. While i like having the english version of this and will continue to collect the english ones. After watching 1-199 of the series and waiting for 200-208 to come out soon. i am all about that.

Do a lookup for ""yu gi oh the perfect collection"" you will find it for 49 dollars and 52 episodes.. you get dungen dice and legendary heros along with pegasis saga. you can find the jap with eng subtitles all over the net and on most auction sites. The seris is awesome uncut. On a side note.. anyone liking inuyasha you can get the first 54 episodes for 89.oo english dub or 29.99 seperatly. also they have the uncut subtitles version all over the net. I own all of those(...). i am up to 157 now and eagerly awaiting the next release. i have the english version too of that also but there is a big diference in inuyasha just like yu gi oh in the original version, not the dumbed down one. but hey this one is good too. just don't waste 89 dollars. we b search and get teh good english version for 50.
peace out..",1089504000,7,1377,4.0476190476190474
1964468,5,B0000ZG0A4,"I first came about watching yu-gi-oh one sunday morning on tv , im 22 years old just to let you know the age range , its not only kids that find this series intresting.
anyway it was a duel between yugi and underwood , from the moment i started watching it i was hooked.
soon after  i started getting the dvds and watching the series that way.
so far i think duelist kingdom is better than battle city , mainly because of all the mystery involded in it and the major charaters get introduced.
i like the dub and the voice overs , everyone has there own views but heck the voice actor for kabia is amazing and yugi is really brought to life  and joey seems to grow throughout the series as well. , reading the manga of the origonal shadow games in shoen jump graphic novel it feel like that humour they have there  is well protrayed over to the series.
seriously if your looking for a good series to buy , then buy this. by all means try the origonal japanese version too , my language skills not that great so ill stick to english version but in some cases the dub makes the series seem better.
just remember (chessy line coming up) Its time to duel.",1086307200,6,1150,4.218181818181818
1964469,3,B0000ZG0A4,"Yugi Motou, the game king, goes to the island of Maximillion Pegasus to play Duel Monsters in the Duelest Kingdom tournament. Pegasus is after Yugi's Millenium puzzle which gives the wearer the ability to shift souls with the Pharoah Yami who inhabits the puzzle. Pegasus' ambition is to use the Millinium puzzle and the Millenium Eye, that he already owns, to resurrect his love that died prematurely.

This DVD set in only the first season in the US and is the US TV version. It is poor marketing on the part of 4kids to market the edited version, as opposed to the full version released in Japan, when the serial plays almost everyday on the WB channel. The editing of the Duelist Kingdom story does not take away much from the original Japanese edit and is fine as it is. The voice acting is excellent for a redubbed Japanese Anime. Thank goodness because the original voice for Pegasus is very affected and even annoying at times.

Losing very little through the editing, the first US season of Yugioh stands well enough on it's own and is very enjoyable. The serial is not edited for content, but for time as the Japanese version runs 3 minutes more. However, this is only one thread in a very long story and after the Battle City story line it begins to get very complicated. Especially when Yugi goes to Egypt and starts to really find out who he is as the Pharoah. This happens many episodes later and is not in this set.
UPDATE- Since I wrote this a full version of these stories has been released. When comparing the two, the US cut was done really well and after viewing it it doesn't feel like anything was missed.",1086134400,2,1627,4.511864406779661
1964470,3,B0000ZG0A4,"Well, Battle City is one thing and Duelist Kingdom is another. Betweent he 2 I would pick Battle City. One of the reasons is because of the effects that happen in season 1 makes absolutely no sense at all. Ex. In episode 4 Yugi duels against Weevil, deep in a forest where they both gai 30% power bonuses for their monsters. Well, Weevil's Cocoon of Evolution is played but is seemingly destroyed by Gaia the Fierce Knight. But when he first attack it with Gaia the cocoon's defense power is 2600 but Yugi loses no LP. Then he plays the Burning Land magic card and fries Weevil's forests. Then he destroys cocoon but it hatches into the Great Moth anyway. Then Gaia's power goes down due to the toxic dust that is being given off by Great Moth. So Yugi plays Makiu the Magical Mist and heals his Gaia then plays Summoned Skull and totals his Great Moth because the mist left Weevil's Great Moth drenched in dew which gave Summoned Skull an 1100 attack point bonus causing Weevil to lose all of is LP. First of all, how can Yugi attack a creature with 2600 DEF and not lose any LP? Second, why weren't there any tribute rules? Third, how come toxic dust and dew play a key role in this fight? If you ask me Duelist Kingdom is very underated but take my advice and just watch these episodes on TV (if they are played anymore) and buy the Battle City discs where they PLAY BY THE ACTUAL RULES! But, if you realize that Duelist Kingdom was seriously underated by the crowd then buy this and enjoy. Some of my favorite fights were Yugi and Joey vs. The Paradox Bros., Yugi vs. Kaiba on top of Pegasus' castle, and Yugi vs. Pegasus. In my opinion Pegasus could beat anyone because of his Millennium Eye. Buy this if you want to relive the good old days. If you're more into the futuristic stuff then avoid this at all costs. P.S. I know many people say the Japanese voices are better. That's because they are Japanese people who moved to America from Japan and are appaled with all the edits. Just ignore them an you'll be fine.",1084579200,2,2022,4.36604774535809
1964471,3,B0000ZG0A4,"Okay, I personally don't like this idea. But that's just me not liking what the 4Kids or whatever company did to Yu-Gi-Oh.
If you do like the dubbed version, then by all means, go ahead and buy this. However, I recommend the original, uncut Japanese version more. If you look around on the net, I'm sure you can find it somewhere. Some anime stores even have them.
If you choose to go ahead and buy the dubbed, just know that most of the scenes and any plot at all were taken, sliced up, sugar-coated, fluffed up, and then shown. There are very few scenes like they were in the original.",1083542400,7,587,4.345454545454546
1964472,2,B0000ZG0A4,"As everyone else said, this looses a lot in the translation, which this company has done to pretty much all the animes it get. The voices are bad (I mean come on! Joey lives in Japan, but sounds like he's from Brooklin) Get this if you like the Kid's WB version but I suggest you get an import from the Japaneese to get the real effect. Another reason to get the Jap is because they have a season before this that never was, and to our dismay probly never will be, released in America",1082160000,4,484,4.159574468085107
