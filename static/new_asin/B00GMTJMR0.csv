8624843,5,B00GMTJMR0,"A beautiful documentary about a magnificent and unique Hawaiian treasure, Aunty Nona Beamer.",1443139200,,92,6.153846153846154
8624844,5,B00GMTJMR0,"This is a wonderful movie about a great and important person! Nona Beamer carried, fought for, kept, and developed Hawaiian cultures of dance, song, chant, and believes. Kindness, dignity, and love, ALOHA, were her fighting tools for a folk culture at risk. The movie has managed to gather many important interviews of remarkable individuals but carefully avoided repetitiveness. I found myself waiting for more insights all the time! On my desk lays now two DVDs, Nona Beamer: A Legacy of Aloha, and The Power of Song with Pete Seeger, recently passed. Two giants in folk culture!",1391385600,3,581,5.0625
8624845,5,B00GMTJMR0,"I thoroughly enjoyed  Ms Kane' s documentary film on ""Auntie Nona"". But even more than just enjoyment, I learned about this wonderful woman who made such a difference to the Hawaiian people. She was a classroom teacher as I am, so I felt a special connection to her. After listening to the authentic accounts and films of her, I feel as if I know her.
Ms Kane truly brings the essence of this gentle humble person to the screen.

Sincerely,
Marilyn Camp",1389916800,4,453,4.512195121951219
8624846,5,B00GMTJMR0,"I lived in Hawaii for many years and this film is superb.  A warm, wonderful, honest depiction of a woman who truly inhabited the heart of Hawaii.  I once was fortunate to see her perform, though an elder by then she was so gracious and truly a shining example of what makes the Hawaiian dance and music such an integral part of everyone.  This film is so thoughtfully and completely a life story of Nona Beamer, we see her from a young woman to much later in her life and I loved this film.  A must for all who love Hawaii.",1389398400,3,524,4.158415841584159
8624847,5,B00GMTJMR0,"Nona Beamer; a Legacy of Aloha is a wonderful and heart-warming documentary about the impact Auntie Nona Beamer had on those who knew her, learned from her, and loved her. Linda Kane has not created a biography; rather, she has allowed people to ""talk story"" about Auntie Nona, and share their recollections, stories and memories. The film is full of beautiful music, lovely hula and plenty of humor. Full disclosure; I am a friend of Linda, the film-maker, and was treated to a ""director's cut"" version of the film but I have also seen the commercial version at the DisOrient Film Festival in Oregon. This film would be valuable for anyone who is interested in Hawaiian language, music, culture, or the role of women in history.",1384646400,5,729,4.7936507936507935
