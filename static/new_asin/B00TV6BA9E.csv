7022770,5,B00TV6BA9E,"I think this film probably had a greater impact on me because I haven't read Strindberg's play. I can only comment on what I saw on the screen.
Although important issues about class and gender are raised in the film I was most interested in it for its character studies of two deeply flawed people. The fireworks begin when Miss Julie enters the large kitchen in her father's baronial mansion during his absence, and begins behaving provocatively with his valet, John. She repeatedly commands him to accede to her demands. At first he tries to resist being drawn into her ""game' as he calls it, but he is soon totally engaged in a contest for domination with her. Julie appears to have the upper hand backed by her father's title and wealth, but John slowly begins to seduce her telling her that he has loved her since he was a boy and first saw her playing in her garden behind her father's walls. Julie is touched by his stories and softens to him. John completes her seduction in a brutal fashion stripping any romantic notions she may have had about being loved from her. He then begins verbally abusing her for her fallen state in an attempt to deflect all blame from himself. He commits a further act of physical violence towards her, and we realize that they were never equals in their contest. John was always the more masterful of the two. When he realizes that she no longer has any value for him he completes her destruction.

Julie is not an innocent victim, but her suffering is in excess to her original transgressions. She deserves our pity. The real revelation here is John's capacity for physical violence.",1431561600,23,1623,4.615916955017301
7022771,5,B00TV6BA9E,"There are excellent reviews here for this version of Miss Julie, and a prospective viewer would find them helpful.  There have been 3 other film productions of Miss Julie and, if this adaptation of Strindberg's play interests you, it's illuminating to see what the other 3 bring to it.  As film versions have spanned a little over 60 years, it's fascinating to see what each has brought to Miss Julie.  Strindberg zeros in on a moment in time where the tensions of social and moral order have reached a fulcrum and desperation is finely pitched.  His play takes place during the space of one night, Midsummer's Night, when this order is famously suspended and characters are free to forget them or to consider them in another light when the darkness of nighttime is the shortest of the year and this is the perfect setting for what occurs in this play.  Of all the 4 film productions of Miss Julie, this is my favorite, so far.  The team of Ullmann as director and Chastain, Farrell, and Morton as actors is a very good one.  They manage to cover all the complex dynamics thoroughly and with so much insight.  This film isn't for everyone and some have found it boring...this reviewer found it wonderful!  The set is fantastic, just to say.",1431388800,5,1240,4.6255707762557075
7022772,1,B00TV6BA9E,Boring.  Very slow pace. I don't know why an Academy Nominee actress like Jessica Chastain and an equally talented Colin Farrell would star in this kind of movie. Poor plot. No wonder this movie bomb in the theaters.,1431302400,5,216,4.684210526315789
7022773,5,B00TV6BA9E,"August Strindberg wrote his play MISS JULIE in 1888 and while it is often performed today by classical repertory companies, the story is strong and deserves the very frank and stage-like production that brilliant actress Liv Ullmann brings to the screenplay adaptation and directs with a sure hand.

The story is set on Midsummer's Eve on the estate of a Count in Fermanagh, Ireland. Miss Julie (Jessica Chastain in a brilliant performance), the young woman of the title, is drawn to a senior servant, a valet named Jean (Colin Farrell also quite brilliant), who is particularly well traveled, well mannered and well read. The action takes place in the kitchen of Miss Julie's father's manor, where Jean's fianc&eacute;e, a servant named Kathleen (Samantha Morton), cooks and sometimes sleeps while Jean and Miss Julie talk. On this night the relationship between Miss Julie and Jean escalates rapidly to feelings of love and is subsequently consummated. Over the course of the story Miss Julie and Jean battle until Jean convinces her that the only way to escape her predicament is to commit suicide.

While the acting and cinematography and production values are excellent, the aspect of Liv Ullmann's emphasis on Strindberg's reason for committing this work to the public - as one historian phrased it well, `Miss Julie and Jean, as vying against each other in an evolutionary ""life and death"" battle for a survival of the fittest. The character, Miss Julie, represents the last of an old aristocratic breed about to die out. Whereas Jean represents one who is clambering upwards, and who is more fit to thrive because he is better able to adapt in terms of the ""life roles"" he can take on. The play contains a variety of themes, partly because Miss Julie's actions are motivated by a range of factors and influences: her class, her desires and impulsive nature, her father, and the dynamic traumas of her family histories.'

The musical score is brilliant - various combinations of violin, cello and piano with works by Schubert and Bach performed by Hvard Gimse, piano, Truls Mrk, cello and Arve Tellefsen, violin. The music is an integral part of the atmosphere. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, May 15",1431216000,14,2207,4.991847826086956

7022776,4,B00TV6BA9E,"NOT SO MUCH A TALE OF SEXUAL DOMINATION AS IT IS A STRUGGLE FAR MORE FUNDAMENTAL AND DARWINIAN (as explained by the author)  --- HOW TO ASSESS IF THIS FILM IS FOR YOU

***THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.  --  FOR THOSE WHO WILL NOT LIKE IT, I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU TOO.  Many readers will notice a heavy number of negative reviews for this film despite other very positive feedback.  Though I am a fan, please accept this attempt to direct and help viewers according to their own tastes.  It's completely understandable this film will not appeal to some and there is no reason to be offended by opposing views.  FIRST: this is a stage play shot as a film.  It's an excellent translation, but still runs similar to a play.  For some this will seem slow despite excellent cinematography and vivid imagery.  SECOND: as I explain in the review below, the original play had symbolism that can be confusing if not explained prior to watching.  THIRD: it is not a happy tale.  Each character has unpleasant attributes.  But please understand it mainly accomplishes its purpose, as designed for its intended audience.  If you dislike stage plays, dialog driven films, or downbeat stories, this movie will not meet your tastes.  That's perfectly understandable.  Whether you love it or hate it, please don't be offended by earnest attempts to help and inform.

Some viewers landing on this product listing will perhaps be searching for a romantic period tale, or even a story of sexual domination partially suggested by the trailers.  That might leave some searchers disappointed even though this is actually an excellent and very cinematic adaptation of a famous play.  In fact, without understanding the point of August Strindberg's original 1888 play, the actions of some characters in this film may seem contradictory at times.  Though sex is an important factor, it's not the crux of the struggle.  It is a far more basic evolutionary battle set between two characters from opposite ends of the class spectrum.  This at a time when the stratification between the classis is also about to undergo change.  This is explained by Strindberg in his forward to the play and helps immensely.  This adaptation looses some nuances from the play that help explain what is pushing the characters.  However, it adds amazing nuance by seeing the emotion first hand in the performances of the three actors.  It feels very cinematic in that they can move around the house and even outside in natural ways.  The cinematography is just stunning!  The manor house, the lands, the colors are all just amazing.  Jessica Chastain is made other-worldly with her red hair set against the blue of her dress, her pale skin and red lips.  However, prospective viewers should be aware that with only three characters viewable, this is a very dialog driven tale and one still feels that hint of isolation that is also intentional in this dark struggle.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  Northern Ireland 1890.  Miss Julie is the daughter of a Baron (it was a count in the original) living in an extraordinary world of privilege.  She is influenced by the fantasy books she often reads, and by the education from her mother that she should be no man's slave.  She was brought up to be independent, to think and act like a man.  This is not entirely explained in the movie but it helps to understand one of the several elements as to why she feels she can play with men the way men would normally play with her in that age.  We begin with a flashback scene of her as a child that has symbolism between her and a passage of literature she reads from one of her books.  The movie also injects a sense of loneliness and abandonment as the house is empty.  Flash forward to 1890 on mid-summer's night.  Miss Julie (Jessica Chastain)  is an adult.  John (Colin Farrell) is the Baron's Valet and Kathleen (Samantha Morton) is the cook and John's fianc.  Note that in the original play the servants were named Jean and Christine but have been changed for this adaptation.  The two servants are having a conversation in the kitchen as John complains about his duties and the behavior of Miss Julie at a dance where she stooped below her station, dancing with the gamekeeper and even ordering him to dance.  John orders Kathleen about and talks of far away places like Paris and Lake Como in Italy.  For a servant, John is actually well traveled and has given attention to his education.  Miss Julie walks in on the conversation and quickly begins to exude the presence of the mistress of the house, and of romantic or sexual interest.  It becomes more assertive and eventually feels almost like that of a dominatrix. Now the stage is set for the real battle.  The upper hand will sway back and forth, which can be a little confusing if the viewer doesn't realize the more fundamental struggle that is taking place.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  This evolutionary struggle is made more intriguing in that - it is not so simple as a man from the servant class against a man of the ruling class.  It is a woman of the upper class taught to think like a man, and a man of the servant class who is still well traveled and somewhat educated  relative to his station.  He aspires to more in life.  This adaptation may not portray some elements as strongly as the play, such as Miss Julie's fascination or recurring dreams of falling from her pedestal, nor Johns life long desire to own a hotel and raise his status.  I could nitpick some very minor things, however, the performances were all outstanding.  Chastain's emotional range, the ability to switch from girlish charm, mistress of the estate, vulnerability, near sexual predator, to even hints of insanity just in the reflection of her face was really haunting.  Farrell also gives one of his most emotional portrayals.  This is a play with dramatic events, but still performed true to the naturalist movement it belonged to.  I love stage plays and I love films.  But I don't always like stage plays shot as films.  They are often claustrophobic and dry.  However, in terms of filming and cinematography, I would call this one of the best translations I have seen while still maintaining the feel of a play.  Though the isolation of the characters is necessary in this case, the only thing I felt giving it away as a stage play was the fact there were only three characters in view (Other absent characters play a role and give meaning).  Accolades to the cinematographer and director in that respect.  As for the sexual content, there is no nudity.",1430870400,110,6537,4.7063492063492065
7022777,5,B00TV6BA9E,"Exceptional acting--mesmerizing, powerful, hypnotic. Great cinematography too. A masterpiece from a masterpiece.

My only reproach is the editing. Liv Ullmann chose to cut away the image way too much to the listener--especially when the listener is Julie--from the one who is speaking. Sometimes, she abruptly cuts away in the middle of a short reply--like when John (Colin Farrell) says ""You are playing with fire""--to direct and hold the camera on Julie's face. His face was extremely expressive, and suddenly redirecting the camera to her, the tension was lost. Besides, although the two protagonists are extremely good, I found Farrell brilliant. But he was not shown enough, Ullmann obviously preferring to highlight Julie/Chastain throughout the movie. I think she never cut away when Jessica Chastain was speaking to show Farrell's reaction.

I would love to see the first cut of this movie.

This aspect notwithstanding, this adaptation of Strindberg's play is exceptional. The soundtrack adds to the magic. By far, the best movie of 2014.",1430179200,18,1047,5.371951219512195

7022810,5,B00TV6BA9E,"Some reviewers didn't like Miss Julie because it was too dark & the characters too offensive. Listen, boys and girls: This is STRINDBERG! What did you expect? Liv Ullman's additional dialogue is pretty good but too bad she left out Julie's speech about her mother's working class origins & her father's attempted suicide. Also there seemed to be too much stress on class conflict. That particular sort of class society is not so relevant today and Strindberg was certainly no socialist. On the contrary. Rather the class structure was a given as it was for Dumas (La Dame aux camelias, i.e. La Traviata), a background for his real concern which was the mutual destruction of the sexes & the emotional inferiority of women. Unfortunate that - If you have any doubts read Strindberg's Preface which is actually better than the play. To her credit Ullman left in the more incendiary lines about women. Her direction of the actors was superb especially considering she had to do it in English with complex differences of accent. The art direction and sets are also great. Colin Farrell played Jean as both obsequious and conniving. Samantha Morton made the best of her two big speeches. Jessica Chastain is the finest actress working today but I have some problems with her Julie. She started out as a certifiable nut case. A young flirtatious petite maitresse would have made more sense and rendered her degradation more striking. Chastain can get carried away with the hysterics and and she seemed out of sync with reserve of the other players. She also played Julie much too old. Chastain can look younger than she is as we saw in Jolene and part of Strindberg's point is that Julie is an idiot girl. Some of the blame lies with a poor make-up concept. In any event Chastain looked like she could turn into the incestuous vampire from Crimson Peak at any moment. Wonderful score - mostly unadorned Schubert. The cultural decay of the Swedes can be measured in the descent from Strindberg to ABBA to the depths of the so-called Swedish Model.",1474070400,3,2040,4.798295454545454
7022811,5,B00TV6BA9E,"Despite a lot of the poor reviews, this was an excellent movie.  The subject of Strindberg's play, itself, I suspect, is the reason for some of the poor reviews, e.g., ""a depressing film,"" "" did not enjoy it at all,"" etc.  It was an excellent production, with wonderful acting. Colin Farrell does not choose ""safe"" vehicles to perform; the variety of his films, much like Colin Firth's and Ewan McGregor's, is praiseworthy.  This is not a movie for those who are likely to be depressed; instead, it should be reviewed for the quality of the production and all of its three actors.",1471392000,3,580,4.666666666666667

I didn't mind the style so much; certainly it was a new experience to watch a movie that took place in essentially one room, but it wasn't terrible.. The story is what ruined it for me. And this movie was so slow. They kept going back and forth with the same argument, ""I hate you, you disgust me."" ""Well YOU disgust ME!"" ""I hate you, no wait I love you."" ""I love you, let's run away."" ""I would but I hate you!"" ""Well I was kidding, I don't love you, you're gross."" And it went on like that for almost the entire duration of the movie!

And, because of this banal and childish (and BORING) back and forth, there was never that ""POW!"" moment they kept trying to build up to. It fell flat. The actors did what they could but there wasn't much to work with. I honestly felt disgusted and dirty after watching this film. Maybe I just didn't ""get"" it but I thought the concept--or rather, the execution of the concept--was awful.

This girl has no sense of self other than her station in life--a woman who comes from money but actually has nothing of her own, the only thing she has to herself is how she can order her servants around. When she sleeps with Colin Farrell's character, he takes that away from her in the most despicable way possible. I'm not even sure their sex was consensual based on her reaction afterward. The man is sadistic. And Miss Julie is desperate for a sense of self, a purpose, love. He deceives her, uses her, and then eventually becomes her non-direct killer.

I thought this movie was just sick. Maybe if you're into mistreatment and abuse of women you'd like it? It was a somewhat of an interesting commentary on the sexism and socioeconic stations of the time period, but it was done in a tasteless manner.",1452556800,4,1759,4.419753086419753

7022841,1,B00TV6BA9E,"I knew when I read that the film was adapted from a play by Strindberg that this was not going to be a lot of fun.  The cast was good enough to keep me watching, although, as I suspected, it was not a lot of fun.  I fast forwarded a few times because it was dreadfully slow....and not a lot of fun.  I did stick it out to the bitter end and I'm sorry I wasted my time.

I don't think you can blame the actors or the director, Liv Ullman, unless they are to be faulted for participating in such a depressing story.  I realize that Ms. Ullman, a Norwegian, and the former mistress and muse of Ingmar Bergman feels well at home with dark subject matter.. However Ibsen, another Scandinavian  also wrote about dark, serious subjects but there was always something more to his plays than this terrible thing.  Perhaps it was important, stylistically or thematically or something at the time he wrote it for it to have been regarded as important.  Strindberg was not a happy camper himself, suffered a terrible childhood and had several psychotic episodes and it shows in this dreary film.  The actors do their best with the material but there's only so much one can do.  The themes of cIass inequality and the plight of women have been done many places with much more success.

I hope Ms. Ullman goes to Lake Como, where the sun is always shining and people dance all night long.  She needs some serious cheering up.",1442102400,,1411,4.426356589147287

7022881,1,B00TV6BA9E,"Liv Ullmann.  What a tremendous actress.  She was the muse of the great auteur Ingmar Bergman, and she earned that status by repeatedly delivering complex and shattering performances in films like Face to Face, Scenes from a Marriage, Autumn Sonata and Persona.  She is, without question, one of the greatest actresses who ever walked the earth.

Did you know shes also a director?

Yeah, I knew this, and yet I still haven't seen any of her work (shes only directed 3 feature films, a segment in another film, a documentary and a television movie), until now.  Yes, my introduction to the world of Liv Ullmann the director was with this little-seen (or is it just widely ignored) adaptation of Miss Julie.

I prefer Liv Ullmann the actress.

When Miss Julie arrived in the mail, my wife and I were both pretty excited.  We are both big fans of Colin Farrell.  My wife has been impressed with Jessica Chastain, or at least what shes heard of her talent (my wife has actually only seen Chastain in The Help and The Tree of Life, and she fell asleep five minutes into Malicks film so she probably doesnt even remember that Chastain was in it).  I adore Samantha Morton (she really should be in everything) and of course, as I mentioned, Im a giant fan of Ullmann.  Throw them all in a period piece, add sexual tension and the promise of romantic angst and you have our attention.

You had our attention, until you lost it.

I have many, many issues with this film that all really seem to blur into one gigantic problem.  This is my first encounter with the story as well, so maybe Ill take issue with every version of the story as well (I have the 1951 Sjoberg version on my DVR at the moment), but Im holding out hope that Ullmann just messed up royally, because I see so much potential squandered.

My problem, as my review title suggests, is that these characters are so incredibly unstable and unbearably tonally challenged that the whole film feels like absolute ridiculousness.  The unabashed scenery chewing is so aggressive and in-your-face that it strips away any real character development and presents to an audience a barrage of emotions with no actual substance.  There is no connection or chemistry between any of these actors and so all their actions feel forced and unauthentic.  Chastain is abysmal here, yelling and heaving and clutching things and then trying her hardest to be all stern and commanding and coming off like a child playing house.  She isn't convincing at all, and in many instances shes just downright embarrassing.  Farrell fares better, but the way his character is handled is baffling.  He appears innocently manipulated and then completely taken over by unexplained or really perplexed passions and then conniving and heartless, and then back and forth and back and forth again.  It was like his character completely changed with each passing scene.  And then you have poor Samantha Morton, who lingers in each scene like an unwanted step-child, sulking in the background with her downtrodden expression that gives the appearance of a woman with severe mental problems.  The fact that Farrell is probably the best hes ever looked in the film, and Morton is at her absolute frumpiness, doesnt help this situation, since their love never appears genuine.  Its not like Chastain looks any better (like, hot mess, for real), but the attractions are just unbelievable all around.

This all makes for a film, story, whatever, that I couldn't honestly care less about.  I wanted to, but I believed nothing and by the time it was through I was really hoping that a massive fire was going to break out and everyone was going to die.

Oh, and I know I fell asleep during part of this, because my wife told me something about gangsters, and I have no idea what shes talking about, but I have no desire to watch this again and find out.

When this ended, my wife said to me that this was the worst movie shes ever seen.  Im almost obliged to agree with her.",1435795200,8,3982,4.694524495677234

However, this has been framed as a stage play which it is in original, and the pace is glacial. It just doesn't work for the screen. I believe that the same setting would have been mesmerizing on stage, but here it just feels like a member of an audience has filmed that stage. The directors vision never comes across and his commentary is non-existing. Unfortunately, all the underlying rich currents are lost, and the depth of inner drama of the characters as well as odds with societal norms is not given a treatment it deserves.

But it helps to have already read the play. Liv Ullman was shooting this film as a stage play. That was a brave choice but it didn't quite work out.
The actors are all great. Jessica Chastain showed how she is a ""bird in a gilded cage,"" trapped by society & what is expected of her (to marry ""up"" & not fall in love with anyone ""beneath"" her).
Samantha Morton was very good as the strait-laced woman, bound by typical Lutheran Swedish (of the times) morals.
Colin Farrell is always a brilliant, nuanced actor. Emotions burst out of his every pore.
But even with the excellent actors & a highly intelligent director, the film fails. This is because a modern audience cannot understand (other than historic understanding) how strict the class system was in the time period that Strindberg wrote the play. You were born a servant and you died a servant. A high born woman could boss you around, make you lick her boots and you had better not complain. Even when John (Farrell) ""bucks the system"" after having sex with Miss Julie, it has to end in doom. Their plans to run away together can't happen because the Lutheran morals wouldn't allow that.

7022914,3,B00TV6BA9E,"this is not the august strindberg stage play of the same name, but a very free adaptation by director liv uhlmann. there is much to enjoy in the cinematography, sets and acting -- all three principals are superb in their roles. samantha morton is powerful in several key scenes, jessica chastain projects huge and abrupt changes of mood with virtuosic control; the ""overacting"" that colin farrell displays early in the film is exactly that ... he's a cad, a manipulative seducer, and not what he seems ... at the climax of the story he unleashes the inner beast to great effect. uhlmann's directing vision and skill are certainly impressive.

the problem here for many viewers will be: this is late 19th century material. these are concept characters -- the church lady, the ambitious conman, the nutjob maitresse -- locked in the primal struggle of class distinctions and throbbing libidos. the power of privilege versus the power of seduction, and after all the shouting is over the canary will be decapitated. the denouement is lurid, but also very difficult to believe without 19th century concepts to anchor what must happen if the footman fondles the lady of the house. at this historical moment, jesus can save your soul but sinners don't go to church, and if the baron rings the summons bell, the footman must obey.

because the film is so long (130 minutes, 30 minutes longer than other versions) and claustrophobic (three characters, interacting almost entirely in the manor kitchen), all the film's virtues and beauties can't hold back a growing sense of tedium. dramatic tension is stretched to breaking by the slow pace. the play is, after all, a single snit between hamlet and ophelia (act III, scene i) made into a midsummer night's maelstrom. this worked well enough in the late 19th century, when class privileges were crumbling and brahms was giving way to wagner. today ... one has to ask why four film versions of this play (one currently out of print) were necessary.",1432944000,2,1988,4.896142433234421

There are many ways to tell a story of someone trying to rise and someone free falling, or of the unfair shame placed on a woman. The way it was handled in this film was not enjoyable or thought provoking, nor did it change me in any way. I expect one of those 3 things to occur as a result of watching a movie.

7022917,4,B00TV6BA9E,"This was hard to watch if you didn't know what you were getting into from the very beginning. About 35 minutes in, i realized that this is basically a very extended scene. These characters are in the same day, same clothes, same house. It is a stage play that was adapted for film. The acting was astonishing, truly mesmerizing on behalf of Colin Farrell. This may be one of  his best roles, i can only imagine seeing this on a stage, it would be magnificent. As a movie, it was slow and you truly have to be in the mood for this sort of film. This was a study on character more so than an active film experience. Both Jessica and Colin gave outstanding performances reminiscent of the theater with intense up and downs of emotions, exhausting at times. This movie creates conversation after, sort of like a book club, so i can see why the earlier version may have been shown in certain classes, there was much to dissect on behalf of the characters, their speech and actions are truly insightful. This was far different from the average movie, and I'm curious to see how many more plays would be adapted in this manor for i do not see it appealing to a wide audience but it can certainly grow in appreciation among many. In the end, to quote the film "" we're all forced to face ourselves as less than we'd hope to be"" ....so to put it simply, these two were a hot bag of crazy.",1432512000,2,1378,4.32046332046332

7022923,2,B00TV6BA9E,"I just want to be clear from the start that I disliked this movie, excessively. I thought this was going to be an enjoyable, romantic period drama and was pretty taken aback once I started watching. This is a dark movie about characters that are mentally disturbed. It is not a love story. It's a story about selfish, unbalanced people using and hurting one another. The movie felt very much like a play. Shots were focused on the three characters delivering monologues at each other. The acting was superb, particularly the female lead, which made it all the more disturbing. There is a sex scene in which the female lead does not appear consenting. It fades to black, but the stark brokenness of her behavior after the act made me ill. I wanted to give this one star because I found the story unpleasant, but I gave it an extra star since the acting was amazing. Be aware, however, that the acting caliber just makes the story more emotionally disturbing...",1432080000,2,959,4.647058823529412

7022930,4,B00TV6BA9E,"If you don't like plays and the theater don't watch this you probably won't enjoy it very much.  However, if you do enjoy theater then you will enjoy this movie too.  It is based on a play with very very few cast members so you really do often have a feeling of watching a play but for me, it's in a very good way.  Miss Julie is one of those stories where you feel like a voyeur watching something you shouldn't be watching but you just can't help continuing to look on as things become more twisted and complicated.  At times I felt sympathy and disgust for each of the two main characters which means Jessica Chastain & Colin Farrell both did a great job drawing me into their stories...which is not an easy thing to do when the two of them have 90% of the dialogue in the film.  Often in a situation like that you might become tired of the actors but both were so very convincing, I was really impressed.",1431907200,6,908,4.22543352601156

7022933,2,B00TV6BA9E,"Love Liv, but I don't think she managed to do much with Strindberg's play but produce a very mopey, long and dawdling shoe-gazer. Chastain and Farrell smoke and crackle like a couple of damp firecrackers, but there's no real fire, and neither actor -- both have been good elsewhere -- ever seems to get a handle on the character or manage to show us the passion that is supposed to produce an explosion at the end. There is no passion, no explosion, just endless talk about class differences. They're both way too twitchy and vague. Farrell is especially weak. He's supposed to be the conniving, worldly servant who lures the half-mad, cloistered Julie to her doom, but all he does is squirm his eyebrows and throw the occasional hissy fit. For this she robs her father, surrenders her virtue, and kills herself? I didn't buy it for a second -- and worse, I didn't feel that Chastain did, either. A stronger, darker male lead might have helped a lot. Liv's directing is languid to the point of listlessness, producing no tension at all as things deteriorate to Julie's tragic end. Even her death is played all languid and Ophelia-like. Ho hum.",1431820800,3,1143,4.691542288557214

Chastain and Farrell are left navigating a script that has them turning 180s from one scene to the next as to how much they desire, love or hate each other. Actors run the spectrum of arrogance to insecurity to pathetic (which isn't bad if given appropriate time and character development) but they are doing this in a span of 5-10 minutes, and repeatedly! This was supposed to be a commentary on Victorian morals, gender, class and social inequalities. A spin off of the Healthcliff/Wuthering Heights theme so to speak.  The problem is, none of the main characters are particularly endearing or sympathetic - Aside from the script being too frantic, the characters were not believable and I rather wished they'd all walk out in front of a train by the end. Even the wronged ""Kathleen"" played by Samantha Morton displays how shallow she is with a self righteous comment to a vulnerable and devastated Miss Julie (Chastain), that the wealthy cannot get into heaven according to the Bible (the, ""easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle,"" line), twisted for her purposes, and that God's grace isn't given to everyone. In this way Kathleen asserts her ""superiority"" and in the process shoots down any sympathy you may have had for her character.
