6357844,5,B00JHH1VSW,"This is one of those horror films that wouldn't get a second look from most folks.  But for a life-long horror movie lover who watched it on HBO more than a few times about three decades ago, it's so good to see ""Without Warning"" get a Blu-ray and DVD release from Scream Factory.  For its impressive roster of notable actors (Jack Palance, Martin Landau and David Caruso among them), the acting and scripting scream LOW BUDGET.  And yet the special effects are somewhat better than average. The most-interesting of the effects involve the alien's little Frisbee-like friends that glow in the dark and resemble spinning grilled cheese sandwiches with teeth.  Whirling through the air, attaching themselves to humans, slurping and sucking like there's no tomorrow.

Spoiler alert!  With about 12 minutes left in the film and with a costume right out of the old ""Outer Limits"" wardrobe department, the alien finally appears only to be shot and spew antifreeze out of its wounds.  (Alright, so not all of the effects are noteworthy.)

For all of its faults, I've grown to like this little-known film more and more with each viewing, but finding it for my movie collection was a big challenge.  I purchased a dub of an import - complete with Japanese subtitles - from a fellow collector some years ago, only to have it turn up again on late-night cable television in more recent years.  For anyone who hasn't seen ""Without Warning"" since 1982 (around 2 a.m. on HBO), it's just as bad as it ever was - and a real guilty pleasure.

The movie itself is no better than 2 and 1/2 stars, but I rounded up in my excitement of realizing it will be out just in time for my August birthday!  My five stars are for everyone associated with giving this film a proper release.",1400025600,13,1759,4.656957928802589

The movie is typical of 80s  horror flicks but it brought  back memories of my youth. The movie isn't half bad if you were from the time period of its release. That it was put on blue ray was surprising but for me i enjoyed it for what it was.. a movie of its period.

6357874,4,B00JHH1VSW,First time watching this creature feature. And I thoroughly enjoyed this sci-fi flick. Palance and Landau were in top form. Even though at times they were over the top but it was appropriate for this kind of picture. The bonus features were also pretty informative in the development of this low budget creature feature and I also liked the little piece on Palance getting ready to slug a young David Caruso in the face if he didn't stop laughing at him. Good stuff.,1416355200,2,466,4.626506024096385
6357875,5,B00JHH1VSW,"What a pleasant discovery this film was! I can't remember ever even hearing about this film when it first came out, much less seeing it. Such a shame!  Thanks to the genre-loving junkies at Shout! Factory this is being made available. (Seriously, Shout! Factory has to be one of THE most amazing home video releasing companies EVER! Damn near every title they offer is some awesome, time-worn nugget from the good old days, whether its an old TV show you grew up loving or some hard-to-find movie you barely remember from your past, S!F just ROCKS!)

Anyhow, if you've never heard of WITHOUT WARNING, then just take a chance and pick it up - especially if you're a fan of films like The Boogens, Critters, House, The Wraith and other sorta obscure sci-fi/monster films from the 80's. WW will be right up your alley. Awesomely talented, Oscar-winning actors Jack Palance and Martin Landau add tons of star power and lend mucho credibility to this spook fest, along with a huge boost from sturdy character actor stalwarts like the always-fun Cameron Mitchell, gruff-but-lovable Neville Brand, Sue Ane Langdon, Ralph Meeker and even a fun bit part from F-Troop's Larry Storch! This amazing film relic also features perhaps the first major acting role for future ""CSI: Miami"" team leader David Caruso. Academy Award-winning cinematographer Dean Cundey shows why he went on to become one of the best in the biz with some truly impressive, spooky and creative lighting; surely no easy feat since most of the film was shot at night on location in the woods.

The storyline is simple: alien comes to Earth to hunt people. Think of WITHOUT WARNING as a sort earlier, leaner version of PREDATOR, but without the big budget & over-the-top pyrotechnics. It's still lots of fun and, unlike so much of the slasher trash made during this time period, actually has some interesting characters and a few original shocks & scares. Sure, it shows its low budget limitations at times, is kind of schlocky and has some cheesy moments, but all-in-all I really enjoyed this film and am thankful to have it available. (And in a nice, cleaning-looking & sounding Blu-ray to boot! Wow! Sweet!) A solid 5 stars for this fun alien-on-the-loose fright fest.",1415577600,3,2228,4.87335092348285

I had never seen this movie before, but it sounded interesting and right up my alley. Boy was I wrong. It never once held my attention or captivated me. The scenes jumped around and didn't make sense sometimes. The acting of the greats like Palance and Landau was awful to say the least. They were great in Alone in the Dark. The aliens were just stupid and the opening sequence with the father and son was ridiculous. The transfer to Blu-ray was bad and it was as if you were watching VHS or Beta Max.

6357884,4,B00JHH1VSW,". .. The main scenario is pretty routine and familiar, being basically that of a typical early 80's style ""body count"" flick with a main cast of good looking young protagonists getting bumped off by a prowling killer, . .. however, instead of a masked psycho, the said assailant HERE is a hideous and sinister SPACE ALIEN armed, not with a knife ax machette weed-eater or what have you, but with these organic living carnivorous ninja stars which it  uses as murder weapons!

There are allot of good shocks and gruesome make up effects ( which are very well done and accomplished ), not to mention some pretty interesting characters. Other characters, apart from the aforementioned main protagonists, are an unhinged and paranoid ex-soldier, an old @&&hole hunter with a macho he-man complex that he imposes on his poor ""sissy"" of a son ( respectively played by veteran actors Martin Landau and Cameron Mitchell ), a scout troop and their leader ( played by Larry Storch ), a sheriff, and an elderly country hermit ( played by the great Jack Palance ).  There's also a very beautiful young female lead ( Tarah Nutter ).

 So, in summation, good good shocks, good effects, good characters, good cast, good imaginative and original concept for a scarry and menacing monster/killer, and good frightening and fun little flick! Highly recommended.",1410566400,4,1342,4.920353982300885

6357886,5,B00JHH1VSW,"Greydon Clark's ""Without Warning"" has finally made it to the Shout!/Scream lineup, which will at last give historians a chance to see what an early alien/hunter story looked like oh so long ago. (This isn't ""Predator"" (1987), make no mistake; Jim and John Thomas wrote that one as a military style film in which an alien invader comes on the scene, whereas ""Without Warning"" is very much about character, as poorly developed as some of these characters may be in fact.) So don't go into this film expecting the violence and intensity of the 1987 Schwarzenegger blockbuster; in fact, tracing the ""author"" of this initial idea of the outer space trophy collector of humans may be difficult, since it probably originated in a pulp magazine from days long since gone (sadly). I certainly can't think of a film that predates this one that may have used this concept (?). However, Clark's film really doesn't do much with the concept: the camera moves slowly if methodically, looking around for interesting things to happen to these rather lethargic characterizations; the music score (which is quite good overall) doesn't really conduct the emotions of viewers in a truly directed fashion; the alien (while menacing, featuring the tall Kevin Peter Hall) is not on screen very long, and while he may represent a threat, he is more of a nuisance-type rather than the gruesome, overwhelming threat that most hostile alien creations are (think ""Predator""). Do I find the film boring? Well, no...but that's because I am a film historian and I enjoy watching these older titles, seeing what exactly was going on in the history of genre pictures and B-movies (and especially horror films). I think a lot of the film is fun, despite the fact that there is not that much happening on screen, yet this is a far more subtle approach than today's idiotically hyper-violent action pictures--today, ""sci-fi"" translates as ""action picture"" (this film may not be considered ""watchable"" by present day horror and sf film enthusiasts, but that's their loss if so). ""Without Warning"" is rated R, which certainly shocked me, despite the fact that it is a terrific exploitation film concept (there is no nudity or sexuality, very little swearing (if any), and violence is certainly kept to a minimum and mostly off screen--all of this I was very much pleased with, since I love these thriller stories on film but really wonder why other filmmakers can't get creative and stop showing us so much nastiness, gruesome violence, inappropriate sex scenes, along with so much unnecessary strong language--""Without Warning"" is probably a film that your conservative grandfather can watch with you, despite the rating on the packaging). Still, for all of its good qualities, it is a film that can't seem to get itself going, routinely wasting the performances of Landau, Meeker, Brand, and especially Palance (who is the film's hero). Nonetheless, it is fun to have so many screen legends on hand here. The real problem with the film is the script itself (I defer you to Greydon's audio commentary and (the Blu Ray's best feature) interview with producer Daniel Grodnik in order to understand what it was exactly that happened with this script, which apparently began on spec, then got rewritten by another, and then eventually was re-written by Clark himself...oh sheesh!). Anyway, if you are a collector, this is an essential purchase.
As for this new Blu Ray package itself, yes, again Shout!/Scream has given me reason to award a 5-star plus review to what is probably a three and a half star film at best (if not the least reason, ""Without Warning"" shows how a good thriller idea can be delivered on screen without so much constant objectionable content and, especially, without much graphic violence--but audiences did have different attention spans back then). The extras are very good overall here. The Nelson/Nutter interview is actually quite disposable, but it may be of interest to you if you are fans of either of them. The Dean Cundey interview is great for us historians, but it's not quite essential. Co-producer Grodnik's interview segment is the best feature, as he explains how he got into the business, and how he ended up broke after finishing the film. This is fascinating viewing for film enthusiasts. Trailers, and still gallery, are both interesting features as well. The film does prove that an aesthetic of filmmaking based upon little money and strong concepts can actually work, despite the fact that the low-budget exploitation market isn't quite what it used to be, but at least this is a reminder of those glory days long since gone.
Director Greydon Clark offers an audio commentary that is a little sporadic in its quality, but his voice is pleasant enough to hear; he offers an interesting plug at the end of the track for his book ""On the Cheap: My Life in Low-Budget Filmmaking"", which is written in screenplay form, and is an essential book purchase for B-movie lovers. While not quite the archivist as one like Kubrick (for example), Clark remembers quite a bit, but his commentary is, again, a bit too hit and miss for those of us who want more information. Still, a nice package overall. A-",1409875200,3,5197,4.947368421052632

The truth is that the only thing this film and PREDATOR have in common is that the aliens in both films were played by the late Kevin Peter Hall. This is a hokey, but enjoyable, sci-fi/horror flick, directed by Greydon Clark (SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS) about an alien landing on Earth and sending his flying miniature aliens (signs of NOT OF THIS EARTH and other 50's horror films) to attach themselves to human bodies. There is a great cast (including one of the first appearances of David Caruso) and some bloody moments that make this film a fun little bloody early-80's alien invasion flick. Nothing exceptional, just fun.",1408406400,4,777,4.8059701492537314
6357892,4,B00JHH1VSW,"When people think of alien movies from the 1980s, a few come to mind right away. I can only imagine one of those is Predator. Tons of sequels and Arnold Schwarzenegger forever cemented the hunting space creatures in the brains of sci-fi fans worldwide. Unfortunately, Without Warning is probably not found on many of those lists. The movie featured a traveler from another world bent on collecting human trophies and preceded John McTiernans blockbuster by seven years.

Scream Factory looks to right this wrong through its release of Without Warning on Blu-ray and DVD for the first time ever. Slasher and sci-fi enthusiasts will find something to love within the film. Imagine Friday the 13th or Halloween with an alien doing the stalking instead of Jason or Michael. Instead of butcher knives and machetes, the killers weapons of choice are parasitic throwing stars reminiscent of the jellyfish from the classic Star Trek episode Operation: Annihilate! and the Starro invaders from the Justice League comic books.

An alien hunter is lurking in the woods outside a small town. Two teenagers (Christopher S. Nelson and Tarah Nutter) on a weekend getaway find themselves running for their lives after stumbling on the shack where it collects its trophies. Can a gas station owner (Jack Palance) and a paranoid military vet (Martin Landau) put an end to the creatures slaughter?

Without Warning has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray. It wouldnt matter if there were major problems with its 1080p HD Widescreen (1.85:1) presentation or 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio. Audiences waiting for this are going to scoop it up anyway. The video does suffer from some light flickering, but its nothing to make too big of a deal about. It sounds and looks wonderful for a movie that I would imagine wasn't given much attention when it came to safe storage of the negatives. I can envision the original film sitting in a metal canister in some hot warehouse being shifted around and having other containers piled on top of it for the past thirty-four years.

The Blu-ray release of Without Warning comes with some fun bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Producer / Director Greydon Clark. A few different featurettes include interviews with actors Christopher S. Nelson and Tarah Nutter, Producer Daniel Grodnick, Make-up Effects genius Greg Cannom, and Cinematographer Dean Cundey.  They discuss their experiences shooting the film and reflect on what the movie means to horror fans today. A theatrical trailer and still gallery are found as well.

Without Warning is rated R for violence and gore, adult situations, profanity, and frightening / intense scenes. By todays standards, this would merit a PG-13 rating at the most. Surprisingly for a 1980s horror flick with camping teens, theres no nudity to be found. The after-death scenes of the aliens victims really aren't that graphic.

With its special blend of sci-fi, slasher, and horror elements, Without Warning is a must-see for anyone who enjoys those genres. While it maintains a low-budget independent film vibe throughout, it rises above other B-rated fare through charismatic performances by legendary actors Martin Landau and Jack Palance. F-Troops Larry Storch and CSIs David Caruso also star as victims of the aliens blood sport. An extra incentive for seeing it is to experience the fun practical effects and early creature design work by Rick Baker.",1407974400,2,3418,5.114695340501792
6357893,4,B00JHH1VSW,"DISC REVIEW:
The folks at Scream Factory have done it again by bringing this hard to find cult classic to DVD and Blu-Ray for the first time ever. This 1980 low budget sci-fi flick (full movie review below) has been out of reach for decades and Scream Factory has resurrected it in all it's cheesy fun, 80s glory. The combo DVD/Blu-Ray pack features a remastered print with a really nice package of extras. We get commentary from director Greydon Clark along with all new Scream Factory exclusive interviews with leads Christopher S. Nelson and Tara Nutter, producer Daniel Grodnick, legendary cinematographer Dean Cundey and make-up FX master Greg Cannom. They are all fun recollections about the making of a lost cult classic... and a personal guilty pleasure of mine. Scream Factory always gets some fun and informative interviews out of these people, treating us to an inside look at a film the likes of which would normally not get... but strongly deserves... such star treatment. A lot of enjoyable nostalgia here.

As for the print itself, the film looks as good as it probably ever will. There is some flickering and extra grain in some of the darker scenes. Probably due to flaws in the existing print revealed when those scenes were lightened but, as a film left in a closet somewhere since the 80s, this is probably the best source material available and considering it's age and the low budget nature of it's production, it still looks really good and the colors are rich and the image crisp. The sound is clean and very good quality and overall, despite any minor flaws in the source print, this looks far better then one might expect and the overall quality far outweighs those minor anomalies. Another great job by Scream Factory giving a cult classic the respect it deserves. Definitely recommended!

FULL MOVIE REVIEW:
Yet another early 80s gem that I had the pleasure of seeing on the big screen at the great Oritani Theater in Hackensack N.J. This delightfully cheesy sci-fi/ horror flick tells the story of an alien hunter who preys on humans using flying, fanged starfish-like creatures as weapons and a full 7 years before Arnold tangled with the Predator. Without Warning focuses on two young couples (Tarah Nutter, Christopher S. Nelson, Humanoids From The Deep's Lynn Theel and a young David Caruso) who decide to go camping at a remote lake despite the ominous warnings from strange local gas station owner/hunter, Joe Taylor (Jack Palance before City Slickers revived his career). Soon upon arrival at the secluded lake, they become the targeted prey of the extraterrestrial creature and his flying minions who have apparently staked out this area as their hunting ground. Now running for their lives and with no one believing them, they have only the gruff off-balanced Taylor and crazy war vet and conspiracy theorist ""Sarge"" (Martin Landau before Ed Wood revived his career) to turn to. Apparently these two have had dealings with this evil E.T. and have been equally ostracized for their claims so, maybe now it's time to stand and fight. This 1980 film is cheesy fun and brings a lot of unintentional laughs such as one youth's attempt to describe the alien threat to a bar full of drunk locals and the alien actually stopping to steady a swinging lamp before continuing his pursuit of a victim. Greydon (Satan's Cheerleaders) Clark directs from a script with no less than 4 writers listed for some reason. He gives the flick a rather pedestrian pace but, he treats his material seriously as do the cast, especially Palance and Landau who properly chew up the scenery with Landau especially cranking up the nuttiness. Aside from them, though, the acting and dialog is strictly what you'd expect from a B-movie like this and the barely adequate performances suit the material oddly well. The production is strictly low budget with some passable alien SPFX and OK gore from future FX master Greg Cannom with the alien head by the legendary Rick Baker. There isn't a lot of action till the last act but, it is entertainingly worth waiting for and the fact that everyone in the small lakeside town seems to be some kind of nut does go a long way to make up for it in the meantime. And who can pass on a three-way showdown between Jack Palance, Martin Landau and a 7 foot purple alien? Not me! Add in a typical 80s electronic score and some nice cinematography by frequent John Carpenter DOP Dean Cundey and you have a good example of the type of B-movie they sadly don't make anymore. Despite all it's inadequacies, it's heart is in the right place. Not a classic or great movie by any length but, it is a fun 80s `so bad it's good' flick to enjoy with a couple of beers and a few other flicks of equally enjoyable awfulness (like Laserblast for example). Without Warning also features appearances by film vets Ralph Meeker and Neville Brand as doubting locals and Cameron Mitchell and Larry Storch as a hunter and scout master, respectively, who are among the creature's first victims. Nostalgic 80s fun.

MONSTERZERO NJ EXTRA TRIVIA:  Ironically, the alien hunter here is played by Kevin Peter Hall who also played the Predator in the similarly themed, classic Schwarzenegger flick in 1987.",1407283200,14,5220,4.816053511705686

6357895,2,B00JHH1VSW,After watching this movie for an hour I had to turn it off. There is better movies to watch and this is the 2nd movie I checked out because of the positive reviews. Like Nightbreed this movie is pretty bad even for a B movie.,1407110400,,225,4.022222222222222
6357896,5,B00JHH1VSW,If you was Growing up in the late 70's & 80's you know how movies where at those times. I gotta say this one Movie was one Scary Flick and still Scary when Seen Today. The Effects are Cheesie but worth watching. I have the Orig Format so watching it in Blu Ray must be worth Buying it.,1403654400,7,285,3.9310344827586206
6357897,5,B00JHH1VSW,"About dang time this came out on DVD!! And it's a Blu Ray release at that !!
This cheezy grade 'B' movie from the early 80s just oozes goodness, from the flying bloodsucking toothed-frisbees that the cabbage-headed alien throws on people, to the so-bad-it's-good acting from Jack Palance, Walter Koenig, and Neville Brand.
Basically as other people have noted, it's a Predator precursor, with the alien hunting people and storing away the bodies as trophies.
For me, I never could forget the eerie music and building suspense in the film. Just don't go into it expecting high-budget effects and enjoy!
I knew I liked the Scream / Shout Factory studios before, but now?  I'm their full-on Groupie for releasing this film !!",1401062400,35,722,4.918032786885246

I saw this in the theaters twice when I was about 7 years old and it scared me enough I went back for more. Completely campy compared to today's standards, but when you're young and a have a growing imagination, this is just plain fun.",1400284800,11,308,4.065573770491803

8650829,1,B00JHH1VSW,"Don't believe the hype this movie sucks. It's slow,badly acted, terribly written,and just predictable. It's not so bad it's good it's SO BAD IT'S BAD.

The budget was a mere $150,000 and on the extras the producer states he had to pay Rick Baker $19,000 to make just the aliens head! Then why not show it more and get some bang for your buck? You don't even see the alien until about 75 minutes into the film.

Palance and Landau are hammy and look like their just picking up a fast paycheck. Meeker, Brand, Mitchell, and Storch are totally wasted.

I love Greydon Clark's earlier movies and i think the reason this one sucks is that he didn't have anything to do with the writing. The script passed through multiple hands and it shows. AVOID.",1495497600,,743,4.488888888888889
