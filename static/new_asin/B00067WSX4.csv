8039972,5,B00067WSX4,"I wish I knew what songs are on the disk? I would like to learn his picking technique for ""Carpenter"" it's so great and I need to know how to play it!",1481932800,,150,3.71875
8039973,3,B00067WSX4,"As others have pointed out, Jack doesn't really teach these as much as perform them. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner as it could be kind of confusing. Jack often adds or omits phrases seemingly on a whim; his playing isn't very mathematical. The tab is absolutely useless. I'm giving it three stars because the DVD is worth having just to learn ""Black Snake Moan"" and ""If I Were a Carpenter,"" though it's better to use them as launch-pads for your own renditions than copy his playing, especially if you want it to be even. So if you're a beginner, pass this one up, but it can be useful to the intermediate and up players looking for ideas. Don't get hung up on playing each song exactly, I'm sure Jack never does.",1420502400,,724,4.451127819548872
8039974,5,B00067WSX4,"I've been lucky enough to meet Jack now twice and have time to chat with him.  I also play guitar...so I was thrilled to find this DVD.
However, I was more thrilled to get Jack to sign my Guitar...on his last tour.  I feel like I'm the luckiest man on earth to have met this man and  been able to THANK HIM for all the years of touring and allowing fans like me... to have the privilege of meeting him.
  This DVD is for intermediate students.  It does not a lot of guitar licks or runs..however for the FAN of Ramblin Jack Elliott it is a MUST.",1402099200,,545,4.046728971962617
8039975,5,B00067WSX4,"We loved this DVD.  It was so natural, we have been fans for years but so hard to find anything in Australia.
Thank you so much, loved the whole DVD",1369526400,,148,3.933333333333333
8039976,4,B00067WSX4,"My boyfriend loved playing guitar along with Jack. We like hearing his stories, especially, when Arlo Guthrie was talking to him.",1355529600,,129,5.190476190476191
8039977,4,B00067WSX4,"I do agree with the previous reviewer that Ramblin' Jack does not ""teach"" these tunes but ""performs"" them instead.  He doesn't break them down or explain his style much.  On the other hand, this is a very enjoyable dvd and I found it helpful in learning the songs on it.  I'm just an intermediate back- porch picker and grinner.  I may not play them note for note as Jack does, but I can get the flavor and feel from the dvd and the tab is pretty well written.  I doubt that Jack plays them note for note every time!!  None of the songs are so complex that even a fairly new player couldn't use them to at least get the chords and strums figured out.  With the fingerpicking tunes you do need to be comfortable with syncopated Travis-style fingerpicking to play them as written.  However, you could always do a simplified fingerpicking version or strum chords.  It was a lot of fun listening to Jack and Arlo swap stories.  And, wow, the people Jack has played with!!  It like a who's who of folk and blues greats.  Jack's singing and playing aren't perfect but he has the elusive quality of being interesting and exciting to listen to.  I'd rather hear that than perfect notes and boring music.  If you like this style music, you'll enjoy this dvd.  Well worth the money.",1329609600,,1272,4.445887445887446
8039978,3,B00067WSX4,"This video is a great deal of fun. If, like myself, you've always loved Jack Elliott's delivery and his stories, you'll probably get a kick out of the repartee between him and Arlo Guthrie. If, like myself, you're buying this to actually learn the guitar technique of Jack Elliott, you will probably be less satisfied. There is not much time spent on explaining fingerings, runs, or chord shapes. That said, Elliott is not exactly Blind Blake. You certainly can learn renditions of most of these songs from this video. But if you're hoping to be spoon-fed the secrets that give Jack Elliott's guitar work it's unique twists, you'd do as well to get CDs, put your head against the speakers and go over each song note for note. Jack is not very forthcoming about what he does or how he does it. Certainly one of the best exponents of Woody Guthrie's 'pendulum picking' style, not to mention the complex flatpicking 'talking blues' structure. Elliott does not 'teach' these techniques which I was very much hoping to learn from this video. He demonstrates these techniques, but he doesn't slow them down. He doesn't break them into small patterns and reassemble them so you can duplicate what he does. In other words, if you're already a fine player, maybe you can make use of these demonstrations at tempo and figure them out. But if you're a beginner, you're going to be just as puzzled at the end of your third viewing of Talking Sailor as you were at the first. The tabulature, too, is rudimentary. It's the tab for the song, not exactly the rendition that Elliott is playing on the video and not all parts are tabbed. In other words, you can develop a rendition of these songs from this tab, but unless you're pretty skilled, it will be your rendition, having little in common with Elliott's arrangement except the key. No one I'm aware of has ever done a serious video lesson on this style of Oklahoma Dustbowl guitar. Such a lesson would be very valuable. Unfortunately, this is not it. The best advice on the DVD comes close to the end when Elliott tells the viewer ""Don't take yourself too seriously.""",1169078400,12,2107,4.666666666666667
