This will make a great gift for a roadracing fan!",1134432000,,181,4.774193548387097
8469095,5,B000BT6MT8,"This DVD chronicles amateur motorcycle racing.  You get a real flavor for what it takes for the average Joe with minimal sponsorship to get out there and run.  From the narrator's questionable background on the street to his maturing on the track, you are afforded an inside and on-board look at what it takes to race.  Interesting diversions from the race season are his track day vacation in England and a car show with the anticipated scenery.  Mark Brereton has gone from hooligan to AMA racer.  This is part of that ride.  If you have any interest in motorcycle racing, watch this DVD.",1134432000,,590,4.679611650485437
