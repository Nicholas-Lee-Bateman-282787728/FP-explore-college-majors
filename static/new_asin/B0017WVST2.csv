3176337,3,B0017WVST2,"I'm about half way through watching the series. The series is great! I read the reviews carefully before I ordered this DVD and took note that some reviewers complained of receiving a PAL format DVD even though advertised as the NTSC format. Well, I figured Amazon probably straightened it out by the time I ordered. I was wrong. I received a PAL version. Assuming there are not any NTSC versions available, I couldn't wait and opened the pack. It wouldn't play in any of the three DVD players I have for TV's. It did, however, play on my MacBook Pro. So, my wife and I have been huddled around the computer.",1220745600,7,608,4.486486486486487
3176338,4,B0017WVST2,"I love Ewan McGregor. My husband loves motorbikes. It's a match made in heaven, right? Well, this series is great, but we like the first trek better. LWR is our choice if we had to pick, but we like them both.",1219881600,,209,4.121951219512195
3176339,1,B0017WVST2,"After reading about ""Long Way Down"" in a magazine I decided to order the entire series. I found it being offered on Amazon.com, but the description stated it was not yet available. After doing more research on the internet, I discovered it would not be available in NTSC format until early October 2008. But I ordered it any way, almost immediately receiving an email from Amazon stating I would receive an email when it became available. I figured this to be in early October 2008. About 3 days after I ordered the DVD set, I get an email from Amazon on a Friday stating it had shipped and would arrive on the following Tuesday, as I am a member of Prime.
Sure enough my DVD's arrive on the following Tuesday and I could not wait to start watching the series. So I opened up the package, put in the first DVD and sat down to start enjoying the show, only to have my DVD player provide a message ""Not in proper format to play on this machine, Format not recognized"". I looked at the case it came in and sure enough it was in PAL format which is made for DVD players in Europe, not the United States. So I looked over the package and my receipt and noticed it said DVD's are not returnable unless unopened.
OK, so now I'm caught in a ""catch-22"". My first mistake was putting trust in Amazon that they knew what they were doing. I immediately went back online and noticed Amazon had corrected their original listing and changed the wording from NTSC to PAL. However they had forgotten to remove the previous customer comment of how Amazon had done exactly the same thing to him.
So here I sit with a DVD set that is totally worthless to me and no way to return it because I had opened it. Getting back online, I found a new Philips DVD player offered by Wal-Mart for $57 that would play both NTSC and PAL and play them in HD. So instead of fighting it out with Amazon, I simply went to my local Wal-Mart store, bought this DVD player which works perfectly and now I can watch the ""Long Way Down"" series.
My problem is this; Amazon knows what they are doing sending out DVD's that are not formatted for North American DVD players, because the original add description was changed to hide their error. Amazon did offer the same Philips DVD player (model 5990), but at a substantially higher price.
Summary: I will probably continue to buy from Amazon, but I have lost a lot of faith in them, especially knowing they had altered their advertisement without acknowledging their mistake. The DVD ""Long Way Down"" is absolutely fantastic, I am loving every minute of it. And I love my new DVD player by Philips. But I feel ripped off by Amazon because I had to spend upwards of an additional hundred dollars for the DVD player and a good set of wires to use it in HD.
Let my review serve to warn you to check anything you order BEFORE opening it, just in case you get caught in the same ""Catch-22"" I have experienced.",1219190400,15,2908,4.377079482439926
3176340,5,B0017WVST2,"I, for one, was hesitant to purchase this 10 episode series after some of the reviews I've read recently. But after buying it, my wife and I were happy to discover that it's just as memorable and enjoyable as 'Long Way Round'. Sure the trip itself isn't as epic, and the first half is rushed due to a tough timetable, but if you enjoyed the sense of adventure, humour and sincerity of the first series, you won't be disappointed. By the time we were watching the last episode, we were as sad as Charlie and Ewan that the adventure was ending. Even when Ewan's wife joined the boys for 10 days during the final leg of the trip the show remained enjoyable. She brought a nice change to the fantastic dynamic that will hopefully not be the last 'Long Way' series. Like Ewan says when his bike is being driven off back to BMW, ""See you in South America.""",1216598400,2,850,4.352201257861635
3176341,5,B0017WVST2,"Just a heads up, but after ordering this I was send the PAL version rather than the NTSC version as listed in the description. Its not a big deal to me as it plays in my MacBook Pro and in the home DVD player anyway. Much more footage than the original 6 part series on TV. This is a 10 part special edition and like Long Way Round it is life changing.",1216080000,20,352,3.9027777777777777
3176342,3,B0017WVST2,"If you could take two things out of this dvd ( goes for the long way round too):
1. They should do a lot more of the work themselves instead of relying on others to have things ready for them.
2. Moan & complain less, I mean they are on MOTORBIKES on rough terrain. Specially Charlie.
Also Boorman needs to learn from his traveling companion,, sorry I mean companions to be a bit more mature, respectful & patient.
The Swiss photographer was so less present in this episode, probably didn't want to come across Charlie's childish temper like he did in the LWR.",1214006400,2,560,4.446601941747573
3176343,5,B0017WVST2,"I have to respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer.  I enjoyed this series a lot.  I was one of those who tracked their voyage through the BBC website, and I was eagerly anticipating this DVD.  I truly felt like I was along for the ride.  This is only the 6-episode DVD.  The special edition 10-episode DVD is coming out soon.  I'm sure that one will be even better.  The whole reason to watch these documentaries is to be able to see places most of us will never be able to go.  You truly feel a part of the adventure.

I don't feel Ewan was being arrogant or a camera-hog at all.  He likes to make fun of himself in that regard.  Everyone who meets him speaks of how genuinely nice and down-to-earth he is.  No, he isn't Brad Pitt.  Ewan is better looking and a better actor!  He may not be considered an ""A-list"" actor, but considering the quality of those who are, that is fine by me.  So what if his family members make some appearances in the series?  He is obviously very close to them.  And if he's making part of the trip through Scotland, why wouldn't he stop by to see them?  I have to agree that his wife, Eve, should not have been on the trip.  You can tell that Charlie did not appreciate her presence, and she shouldn't have put Ewan in the position of making the proposition to the rest of the guys.  I'm sure Charlie and the backgroud crew will get more screen time in the special edition than they did in this shorter DVD.

The sights, the events, the people encountered on this voyage were engrossing.  The obstacles faced on this trip were quite different than the ones faced in LWR, but you're just as happy for them when they make it through.  As in LWR, they don't pretty things up - they show them as they happened.  It's quite refreshing.  They don't edit things out that might make the guys look bad.  They only thing the producers admitted to editing was the big blow-up between Ewan and Charlie that occurred in Ethiopia (which I think was partly due to Charlie's un-expressed resentment of Eve's participation in the trip).  They said it was just too personal and too explosive to show.  Anyway, the beautiful scenery, the animals, the heart-breaking site of the Rwandan massacre, the UNICEF visits, everything just adds to a very enjoyable and interesting adventure.  I'm very much looking forward to the special edition!",1213747200,8,2359,4.497641509433962
3176344,3,B0017WVST2,"Like many of you who have seen or even own ""Long Way Round"" and ""Race to Dakar"", I'm sure you were excited when it was announced Charlie, Ewan, and crew were getting together once again for another adventure.  Unfortunately, LWD (Long Way Down) does not live up to the hype (and certainly did/does not justify the ""paid"" membership to their website). Complaints are as follows:

Charlie and Ewan spend a good part of the trip complaining about being ""rushed"".  This equates to a negative attitude from the participants throughout the trip and more importantly, we the viewer see little of Africa.  The focus is more on staying on a set schedule, which the complaining participants created, rather than a motorcycle adventure.  Don't get me wrong, Charlie & Ewan do get off their bikes, but the majority of the series could've been shot anywhere as we are subjugated to far too numerous helmet cam shots and close-ups plus the endless setting up for camp & camping footage.

Wrong bikes for the series.  There is no need to use the big BMW GS when a more off-road capable bike and more reliable (for fun, count the number of shocks that break) would do - especially when a support vehicle is never more than an hour away.  Unlike the Long Way Round series, Charlie and Ewan spend 90% of their time in Africa with the film crew just out of range of the cameras.  Of course, at the beginning of each episode we are told that the film and support crew would only meet up at borders but that is far from the truth.  We the viewer, get tired of Ewan complaining about how difficult the roads are to navigate - and his love for pavement - suggestion - go tour Germany.

Long Way Round was a buddy movie.  LWD is a Ewan McGregor family adventure.  Pops and brother join Ewan on the first leg of the journey and mom meets up towards the end.  Not too bad, most would say, but wait ... Ewan's wife joins the gang for 11 days in Africa.  Nothing like a high-maintenance zero-personality female sidekick WHO HAS NEVER RIDDEN A MOTORCYCLE to further ruin the harmony of the group.  You can see it in Charlie's reactions and Ewan's ambivalence to the feelings of all the members of the group.

Odds are, it was Ewan's name that drew financial support for this project.  As a result, the camera is focused on him the majority of the time and yes, like the first series, he name drops the movies he has been in throughout the filming in LWD.  I, like many, will get a good laugh when Charlie and Ewan visits the set of the original Star Wars movie in Tunisia and not one single tourist recognizes him.

The one disappointment that will stick in my mind is the lack of respect Charlie and Ewan show towards the President of Rwanda.  They are invited to attend a local wedding and while there, receive an invitation to meet with president.  The group goes out and purchases cheesy suits and shoes and treats the visit as a joke, even trying to drop a funny line ""I love what you've done to the place"" prior to leaving.  This segment is placed between visiting two separate scenes that focused on people who were killed during the genocide.  I was not offended, just disappointed in their level of maturity which makes me question their level of sincerity  regarding Unicef.

I'm giving this series a generous 3 stars.  It could've been worse, but certainly could've been much better -

More camera time for Charlie
Make the support crew invisible
Drop Ewan's wife
Slow down and enjoy the scenery
Give Ewan a reality check - dude your not Brad Pitt
Read a copy of Lonely Planet or two and be a bit more prepared for the different cultures you will meet
Teach Ewan how to ride a motorcycle off-road
Stop yelling ""woo hoo"" - it got old fast

On a positive note -

Watching Charlie have fun was great
Dai, the team's doctor, helping locals - good job
Ruins in Libya - a real treat for us Americans
New BMW's breaking down - who would've thought
Ewan's wife - make's me appreciate mine even more

For those who may think I may be the lone cranky reviewer, I encourage you to visit Amazon.com sites around the world, especially the United Kingdom, to see the huge amount of poor ratings this series has received.  [...]

8267841,5,B0017WVST2,"Purely on accident, I stumbled across ""Long Way Round"" on TV one night.  Within a week, I had the DVD set for it and had no idea that LWD even existed.  However, I was very excited to find LWD and Race to Dakar.  LWD surely can't be compared to LWR because it is a different trip with different dynamics.  Yes, I didn't think it was quite a great idea that Eve would ride with them (mostly for the fact that she was inexperienced as a rider and that put her in a dangerous position).  Obviously she came out of it all right.  It was understandably an upsetting change to the ""boys' night out"" feeling and I happen to understand that angle having spent more time with men and their machines than my fellow females.
  As in LWR, I believe they were able to convey their feelings toward the countries and the people they met, even if they would only have shown video without Ewan and Charley talking about it.  I guess that gives a lot of credit to the photogs (as credit is due!).
  My only disappointment is the availability of DVDs in a format that is read by American DVD players.  Luckily, my computer had no problems with it and I was able to watch either just on my laptop or hooked to the TV by HDMI.

Don't know why it's listed as a soundtrack but the description and cover is certainly the DVD series.

The series is not as good as ""Long Way Round"" but still worth watching.  The adventure was very poorly scheduled.  Most of the time they are running late and have to speed through countries to make deadlines instead of exploring where they are.  Ewan and Charlie's frustration with this time pressure is much evident through the series and takes away from the enjoyment.",1221350400,2,721,5.2
