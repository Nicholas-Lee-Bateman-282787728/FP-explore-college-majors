1060426,5,6305674051,"The Young Girls Of Rochefort was made against all odds. It is a musical, and musicals were all wrong back in 66' Musicals is a very american moviegenre, but this one is french. All dialogue is in french, so that could make anyone feel uneasy at first.
However all that is no problem in this film. Most musicals are romantic, and since french is a very romantic language, this movie gets even more romantic. Even the clothes on the actors has a  romantic touch (they very terribly out of date when the movie was made)
The songs are written by Michel Legrand, and they are very catchy and joyful. This sure is a important movie in Michel Legrands long career. The colors are brilliant, everything has a soft touch.
Gene Kelly has only a small part in this movie, but he makes it bigger. His dancing skills are as good as ever.
The major characters (Deneuve,Dorleac,Chakiris,Dale) does a good job. Deneuve and Dorleac were sisters in real life, you cant see it, but you might ""feel"" it. None of them do their own singing,they are all dubbed.
All together, a nice little movie that gave me a lot of fun. An extra plus for the music.",984441600,10,1128,4.475728155339806
1060546,2,6305674051,"This is a very odd, slightly embarassing movie, that never really clicks. I think the huge mistake Jaques Demy made here was to put Gene Kelly and George Chakiris in the cast, because they just don't fit in. They don't quite fit into their pants either, but that's another story. Youre longing for Vera-Ellen or Ann Miller to match them in the dance department, but instead you get the two French girls who are very pretty, but seem nailed to the floor. What's really peculiar though is that the French notoriously hate American musicals. No American musical, no matter how brilliant has ever worked in France at the box office. But when Jaques Demy reinvented the genre to suit French taste, they embraced the charming 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' and this camp fest. So go figure. The use of colour is striking, like 'Umbrella's' but Demy took credit for something that Vincente Minnelli did in the 40's. Watch The Pirate to see what I mean. On the plus side, if you love 'You Must Believe in Spring' a beautiful neglected song that comes from this jazzy Michel Legrand score, there is a stunning version of it on Barbra Streisand's CD 'Love is The Answer', with English lyrics by the Bergman's.",1411171200,,1197,4.704761904761905

1060549,5,6305674051,"Delightfully French in every way, The Young Girls of Rochefort has a presence that makes up for the thin plotting and obvious preposterousness of much of the action and makes for a really rich and rewarding musical directed with visual flare by Jacques Demy.  Lavish sets, brilliant use of color (those costumes are to die for) and some of the best presentations of unified dance (no wonder Gene Kelly shows up), The Young Girls of Rochefort has enough going for it to completely pull you in.  The very opening number is splendid and sets the tone for this cooky yet breathtaking musical.

Deneuve and Dorleac play twin sisters Delphine and Solange.  They live in Rochefort, France and are Paris bound, hoping to capitalize on their dreams and talent.  In the meantime, two carnies show up hoping to snag the sisters for an act, and woo them in the process.  Delphine is shaking off the advances of an older man, while Solange is flirting willfully with a man who may or may not be connected to her past, and then there is the strange foreigner, the painter in love with Delphine (but unaware of her actual existence) and the looming fear of a murderer.

Seriously.

All of this is vibrantly brought to life with song and dance and basically it all is preposterous and ridiculous and yet delicious and so much fun.  Piccoli and Darrieux are marvelous supporting players, and the film (which received a much deserved Oscar nomination in Original Screenplay) really should have swept the techs with wins for Cinematography, Art Direction and Costume Design.  Its just so beautiful to watch, and Demy douses every frame with style to spare!",1381708800,,1637,4.7935943060498225

1060551,3,6305674051,"If you like the French idea of a musical, e.g. The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, with a da-de-da-dee-da ongoing jazz sound track, this is for you. It's in French. It's pretty. It just kind of rolls along. It's not an Anglo type musical. I gave it three stars because it's not my type (and so many people review it highly, it might as well come down a little). So, 'It's Okay' is fine for me.",1361750400,,385,4.216216216216216
1060552,5,6305674051,"For me, this movie is the answer to the question, ""if you were stranded on a deserted island with only one DVD and some way to play it, what DVD would you choose.""  This production is so wonderful, and so uplifting, the music is so amazingly good and the songs so memorable, that there is no other film besides this which I could watch over and over again and still feel like I can't wait to see it again.  I even purchased the soundtrack to the movie!  I had stumbled across this movie on netflix and the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive that I had to see it, thinking ""come on, it's a french musical?  How good could it be?""  Some people even stated that seeing this movie changed their lives...well it certainly did mine.  About 45 minutes in, I was grinning ear to ear.  This is the extravagant lushly orchestrated musical I've waited for my entire life....it really is that good, and it actually awaked some feelings and romantic desires I thought had completely gone away for me long ago.  When a movie can do all that you know it is truly something special.  Never has the French penchant for celebrating the joy of life been so effectively captured on film...you owe it to yourself to see this movie as soon as possible!!",1340668800,3,1236,4.482142857142857

1060555,5,6305674051,"The Young Girls of Rochefort(1967)is quite simply, a fantastic 1960's musical.
It possesses a compelling storyline and a set of unique characters which keep the audience emotionally involved.
The soundtrack was masterfully composed by musical legend Michel Legrand, and includes some of the best music ever to grace a motion picture.
This is a movie that visually delights the viewer with bold colors and movement  entertaining without the use of irony or pessimism.  Catherine Deneuve, as Delphine, and her real-life sister, the late Franoise Dorlac, as Solange, are enchanting as struggling yet incredibly talented performing artists in this provincial seaside town of Rochefort.
The film's supporting cast, including American screen legend Gene Kelly, dance and sing in a way that could only come from this particular era of film.
So, if you are a fan of 1960's musicals such as The Sound Of Music, Gigi or Jacques Demy's other famous work The Umbrellas of Cherbourg(1964)you owe yourself a viewing of this musical masterpiece. You will not be disappointed!",1299542400,,1060,5.303571428571429
1060625,3,6305674051,"""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" (Les Demoiselles de Rochefort)(1967). Twin sisters Delphine and Solange Garnier (played by actual sisters Catherine Deneuve and Franoise Dorlac, who looked very much alike) live in the small port of Rochefort, France, while yearning for the romance and excitement of Paris. But when a charming pair of song-and-dance men (George Chakiris and Grover Dale) comes to town, the singing, dancing sisters get more than they ever expected. An effervescent, candy-colored film by acclaimed French director Jacques Demy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Umbrellas-of-Cherbourg/dp/B0001BMLUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a>) that co-stars the screen legend song and dance man Gene Kelly (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain/dp/B00004RF98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain</a>), and veteran French star Danielle Darrieux.  These two films were rather recently expensively restored by Demy's widow, the French film director Agnes Varda (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleo-From-5-to-7-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780023234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleo From 5 to 7 - Criterion Collection</a>).

It appears that, coming off his huge, wondeerful worldwide hit in ""Umbrellas,"" that starred Deneuve and boasted a beautiful, semi-classical score by Michel Legrand, Demy, and all involved parties, wanted to pay tribute to the Hollywood musical, while making a ""hipper"" film than ""Umbrellas.""  It was an unfortunate decision, for while ""Young Girls"" retains its charm, it has seriously dated.  Legrand's jazzy score verges on the annoying, as does the jazzy/mod choreography.  The costumes are atrocious, and the poor Dorleac sisters are forced to spend the whole movie in the silliest wigs, and a series of the silliest hats: only Darrieux, as their mother, gets decent-looking costumes.

As mentioned above, Deneuve and Dorleac were actual sisters from a theatrical family, daughters of the actor Maurice Dorleac.  Catherine took her mother's name, Deneuve, so as not to be confused with her sister, who tasted stardom first.  Dorleac was considered less beautiful than Deneuve, but considerably livelier and more charming, both on- and off-camera; it was widely thought that she livened her sister up.  Dorleac was carefree, outgoing, alluring and talented; she began her career at the age of ten, and starred in, among other films, the James Bond spoof ""THAT MAN FROM RIO,"" (1964) (a hard-to-find film I love) where she played a fun and flaky heroine opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo.  She was chic, slim, gamine, pale-skinned, a real brunette beauty, and funny.  And she died tragically, at the age of 25, on the French Riviera, on June 26, 1967, as she was on the verge of international stardom, when her sports car flipped and burned.  Many critics think that her early death deprived her sister Catherine, who did achieve international stardom, of course, of leavening she badly needed.

""Young Girls"" can be annoying, but some of us will welcome any chance to see Gene Kelly dance; and it's the only movie the Dorleac sisters made together, singing and dancing quite competently, for our delectation.",1288396800,,3288,6.060344827586207
1060626,3,6305674051,"I am a high school French teacher and bought this film to show my students. It's great in that it's a musical, and so every syllable is clearly pronounced. The story is just a sappy romance, and easier than most french films for american teens to appreciate. The costumes, music, and dance are nothing short of spectacular.
But the subtitles are disastrous! Because the French is in rhyme, the subtitlers felt compelled to make the English rhyme as well, with teeth-gritting imprecision. I think that even if you didn't understand the French, the english subtitles would make you cross-eyed.
It is possible to write a reasonably accurate translation, even in rhyme. For a stellar example of rhyming english subtitles, watch Cyrano de Bergerac, with Gerard Depardieu as Cyrano. To pull off good subtitles, you need a team of people from both language backgrounds who are good with words.
I would have preferred the film show subtitles that don't even rhyme, so that the viewers can enjoy a reasonable approximation of what the actors are saying/singing.",1265846400,,1052,5.017142857142857
1060627,5,6305674051,"This is a delightful musical with a very young Catherine Deneuve  and her gorgeous sister, Francoise Dorleac who was tragically killed shortly after the movie came out. Danielle Darrieux is the beautiful mother who has left her lover because his name, Monsieur Dame, is too silly. She is left with two beautiful twin daughters, Deneuve and her sister, and a nine year old boy, Booboo. The story is pretty much fluff as a group comes to town for the weekend for a fair. Everyone is in close proximity as coincidence keeps the various lovers from discovering their mates before the end of the film. Gene Kelly is a bit old at 55 but everybody has a good time and the music is terrific. Highly recommended for the music and the girls. It's not a bad way to work on your French, too.",1260057600,2,779,4.485915492957746
1060628,3,6305674051,"Will Delphine meet the sailor who painted her portrait without ever seeing her?  Will Mr. Dame (you heard right) reconnect with the woman who dumped him years ago? Will Solange run into Gene Kelly ever again?  Of course they will, this is a movie.  But you'll have to be patient and slog through elevator muzak by Michel Legrand (not his best); mediocre, repetitious dance numbers; and a silly subplot about a geezer who turns out to be an axe murderer (say what?).  On the plus side, the skies are always bright blue (no need for umbrellas, hint hint) and the two Dorleac sisters (Catherine, later Deneuve and Francoise) are adorable and traipse around in skimpy attire showing off their delightful figures.  In this picture, Cathy is sweet and charming and doesn't do her ice queen bit.  Fran flaunts her freckles and red hair and just has a good time--if you believe she can compose music, as the movie claims, there's a famous bridge available for sale, cheap.  It's too bad she couldn't find someone to drive her to the airport that fateful day or else she might have lived to make more movies.",1238889600,,1099,4.66321243523316
1060629,5,6305674051,"If you are so disposed as to be willing to accept it, joy should follow each and every viewing of this excellently bright movie. Do you need an uplifting plot for an uplifting musical? How about several main characters yearning to find their soulmates? Yet there is plenty of plain fun and humor here too. What you also get is an exquisite cast, bright colors, exceptional cinematography, dance that you no longer see, and lots and lots of great music to transfer you out of the doldrums. Yeah, there are quite a few dancers in Go-Go boots. Maybe it's satire; maybe the producers got a good deal. But you know that you are in the 60's. It's French, it's American, and in the end it's just a whole lot of joyful charm. For the first viewing (if you don't already know), I recommend that you turn the subtitles off and subject yourself to the beautiful French language. The actors are obviously having fun, and this is what puts this film over the top.  P.S. Is Gene Kelly too old for Francoise Dorleac? One of the main themes here seems to be that with artistic soulmates, the usual rules do not apply. Check out William Henderson's excellent (if a bit difficult) book ""The Science of Soulmates"". Also check out Francoise's look when she first sees Gene...priceless?...a hint of the eternal? Furthermore, Kelly's performance is nothing short of sublime.",1216857600,3,1352,4.70464135021097
1060630,4,6305674051,"French director, Jacques Demy, created charming worlds on film that could never really exist.  Every film of his I've seen seems absolutely set in the surreal.  This film is no exception.  While it takes place in modern day (for the time - late 1960s) it has no relationship to any reality I've ever known.  Everyone sings constantly and things happen that could not possibly happen but if you go with it, it's a lovely ride. At it's heart, it's the delightful story of two stunningly beautiful sisters (Catherine Deneauve and Francoise Dorleac) and their wish for true love to find them. Add in the unexpected American cast members of George Chakiris and Gene Kelly (of all people!), and you've got a musical unlike any other you have seen.  The musical score by Michel Legrand is whimsically seductive and memorable.",1208131200,,818,4.856115107913669

- The movie is sung from beginning to end (operetta?)
- All characters sing in French, the subtitles are lovely and poetic
- The music is very light and has a catchy theme throughout
- Like American movies of the era, the movie has beautiful colors and cinematography

1060633,5,6305674051,"I just had to pitch in on this one. I'm a bit of a film geek, and have watched plenty of them. I'd say this movie is one of my personal favorites - definitely in the top five. No kidding. It serves the vital function of reminding me, when I need to be, that life can be a very good thing. I vastly prefer it to ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" whose relentless, weepy tragedy, not to mention its non-stop music, I find a bit much. This one, I think, while admittedly a production that's bit rougher around the edges than ""Umbrellas,"" was truly Demy's masterpiece. Legrand's score is utterly top-notch - again, on par with ""Umbrellas,"" and, like the movie, more upbeat. And it's brimming with lyrics that are jam-packed with first-rate wit and joy. I actually bought the soundtrack. The folks who don't like this movie likely will either find its admittedly low-budget production odd for their tastes, or balk at the overall fruity Frenchiness of it. Inventing other reasons not to like it - it's trying and failing to be American, etc. - I think is also counterproductive. The key is to let yourself go and, indulge in this over-the-top confection. The first number, ""We Are a Pair of Twins,"" is worth the price of admission. Silly? Maybe, but meanwhile surpassingly brilliant and lovely. Catherine Deneuve is, of course, unbelievable. And there's Michel Piccoli! I know this movie has a cult following in France, and is generally well regarded there, but I believe it deserves an international reputation. Maybe the movie is too much itself - too hopelessly and shamelessly French in taking on the American musical genre - to pass the typical dismal critical hurdles that are required. Well, more power to it. Hopefully, history will catch up with it. The sooner, the better. I do wish they'd do one more restoration and improve the digital transfer, but that's just because I'm such a fanatic about this movie. It's a fine DVD, and quite a bargain, although I'm tempted to pony up for the 2-disc special anniversary edition that's available in France...",1187395200,11,2048,4.788135593220339
1060634,2,6305674051,"It's too, well, French, to be a traditional musical (a lot more overt sexuality than what you'd expect from a film with Gene Kelly), but it's too much of a wanna-be American musical (that misses the mark) to stand as a good French film. The romantic pairings are laughable as are the supposed talents of the characters. Gene Kelly looks incredibly out of place and awkward. Yes, it has some lovely music, bright colors, and a few charming characters, but overall is very disappointing. The best part of the film is the smooth and understated opening credit sequence highlighting the ferry ride across the river. It's downhill from there. If you like Jacques Demy stick to Lola and the Umbrellas of Cherbourg. If you like Gene Kelly stick to An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain.",1186617600,2,786,4.702898550724638

Whereas CHERBOURG was inspired by -- but consciously counterpoint to American musicals, ROCHEFORT seems a giant ripoff. Not only did they import Gene Kelly and George Chakiris but huge chunks seem to have been pilfered. For instance, Deneuve's and Dorleac's performance at the carnaval kept conjuring up in me memories of Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell singing ""Two Girls from Little Rock"". This film could have been an American-made B-musical.

I hate to say it, but I found Michel Legrand's music bland - the pastel design and cinematography overwhelming - the acting uninspired - and the plot silly.

I really wanted to like this film. But, I stifled yawns most of the way thru.

1060705,4,6305674051,"Every now and then it's fun to pick up a video you know nothing about--to not even read the back of it--and just experience it without any preconceptions or media hype.

That's what I did with this movie and I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's a very spritely, optimistic, creative piece, about the glories and traumas of youth, of love lost and found, of small-town life, of longing for something beyond what one has.

Not at all realistic-that is one of its attractive points. The bright colors used, the stylized clothing worn, the clean, white-washed look of the town itself all tell you that this is not a story to be taken literally or seriously(lordy help us if it were!), but a fantasy of sorts. The music is fun, as is the dancing (and I'm not really a huge musicals fan, so for me to be saying this is something), and the sixties look pervades.

My only complaint is that it's too long. They could have cut a couple of the numbers to good effect. My theory is that just about everything--be it book, movie, play, whatever--is 20% too long and this one fits that bill.

Still--you'll enjoy it. Sit back, relax, and let this film take you to a more innocent, carefree placewhere the sky is always blue and the people you meet on the street are always happy, or if they're not at the moment, they soon will be.",1154217600,6,1320,4.460580912863071
1060706,3,6305674051,"Three years after his gracefully audacious film, ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"", filmmaker Jacques Demy made a follow-up of even broader scope, a pastel-colored Gallic pastiche of Hollywood musicals. While the format of ""Cherbourg"" is a series of bold recitatives that build on the emotionalism of the simple love story at the movie's core, ""Rochefort"" is a more standard musical within an elaborate tableau of activity set in the seaside town of Rochefort. The featherweight plot centers on beautiful twin sisters, both with a passion for music and romance, and what happens to them when a variety troupe sweeps into town one weekend.

Demy fills the 1967 movie with so many references and tributes to Hollywood musical classics that it all feels overstuffed and overlong with our attention darting constantly among a gallery of superficial characters in various predicaments of less-than-earthshaking consequence. This would all be more acceptable if the musical sequences could transcend the paper-thin storyline. It is in this area that Demy provides a decidedly mixed bag of pleasure and contrivance. Norman Maen's ensemble choreography seems to mimic Jerome Robbins' acrobatic style quite a bit, obviously a conscious nod to the presence of George Chakiris as one of the main characters. However, the numbers look and feel less like ""West Side Story"" and unfortunately more like a sixties-era TV variety show. Michel Legrand, who wrote the music for ""Cherbourg"", composes a light jazz score here that is catchy but more transient in nature. There are no memorable set pieces like ""I Will Wait for You"" or ""Watch What Happens"" here but rather a series of pop tunes with inane lyrics that motor the story along like a sputtering Vespa.

Catherine Deneuve and her real-life sister Francoise Dorleac (who died tragically in a car accident right after completing this movie) play the twins, Delphine and Solange Garnier, with aplomb. They have a relaxed air with each other that gives the film its one element of realism. Their opening song, ""The Twins Song"", provides a charmingly silly introduction as they perform to the camera in matching outfits. Running a glass-encased cafe in the town square, their mother Yvonne is played by French screen legend Danielle Darrieux, the only one who actually sings her own songs in the film. Chakiris and Grover Dale dance with skillful dexterity as the girl-chasing carnies Etienne and Bill, though as both are Americans, their voices are obviously dubbed.

Dubbing is a less intrusive ploy with Chakiris and Dale than having Gene Kelly lip-sync to someone else's voice, which Demy does here in recruiting the screen legend to play Andy Miller, an American composer who comes to visit an old schoolmate in town. Looking fit and youthful for 55 and dancing like he never left the MGM lot, Kelly provides a wonderful albeit brief spark to the film, and one instantly recalls ""An American in Paris"" and ""On the Town"" as he dances so lithely on the streets. However, it's jarring to hear someone else's voice come out of his face regardless of the language barrier. Having Andy fall in love with the thirty years-younger Solange is also a bit of a stretch, but it provides a nice excuse for Kelly and Dorleac to have a graceful, valedictory pas-de-deux in the music shop.

Although musical numbers are plentiful, there are dialogue scenes that slow the movie down considerably, and the musical chairs aspect - which includes an artistic sailor (Jacques Perrin), a volatile gallery owner (Jacques Riberolles) and Andy's modest friend Guillaume (Michel Piccoli) - gets exhausting to track. There is even a pointless subplot about an axe murderer. Still, the movie has certain charms that will draw a specific audience inclined toward this genre. Ghislain Cloquet's colorful cinematography has been vividly captured in the 1998 restoration which is what the 2002 DVD contains, though the outdoor shots sometimes bleach out the intended colors. Other than a few trailers, there are no other extras with the DVD package.",1144022400,5,4052,5.125567322239032
1060707,4,6305674051,"Rarely have I seen a movie that's main purpose is simply to delight us. Jacques Demy's ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" is such a movie. It merely wants to put a smile on our face and light up our hearts, and it succeeds in spades.

 Upon its initial release in the United States in 1968 the movie was met with much criticism. How sad this is. Was the 1960s too cynical a time for movie audiences to appreciate a movie as sweet and gentle as this? I doubt it because Demy's ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"", released three years earlier, was a smash worldwide hit. It also starred Catherine Deneuve and featured a score by Michel LeGrand, including ""Watch What Happens"" and ""I Will Wait for You"", two of the greatest songs ever written. But in 1968 audiences had felt Demy was going to the well once too often. They felt the movie did not retain the magic of the earlier film. Resentment was so strong against this film that Demy's career never fully recovered. Except for ""The Donkey Skin"" (also with Deneuve) what other film by this director has garnered an audience?

 Well believe it or not but I enjoy this film more than ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"". Don't misunderstand me, both films are worth seeing. In fact, if you're in the mood I suggest a double feature night. But the reason I prefer ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" is because I felt ""Umbrellas"" took its story a little too serious. It was about an innocent first love that turns tragic. But ""Girls"" doesn't take itself serious. It is lighthearted. The joy of the film comes in the music, the costumes, the lavish bright colors, the beautiful women, and the Rochefort landscape. The movie is pure eye candy of the highest order.

 Catherine Deneuve and Francoise Dorleac (real life sisters) star as the Garnier sisters. Delphine (Deneuve) is a ballet teacher and Solange (Dorleac) is a piano teacher. Each is looking for true love. But in the meantime sing songs to occupy the time.

 Michel Piccoli plays Simon Dame a man who was the be married to a woman who was going to have have his baby but decided she could not marry a man with the last name Dame so she left him. He has return back to Rochefort 10 years after they seperate just so he can keep the memories of their love affair and who knows, maybe he'll run into her. Then there's a young painter named Maxence (Jacques Perrin) who has painted the portrait of a girl he has never met but claims she is his ideal woman. Next there is Yvonne Garnier (Danielle Darrieux) Delphine and Solange's mother who thinks about the man who got away. All of these people will find their lives intersect as they journey for true love.

 While the story may sound trite or predictable to think such things I feel is to miss the point. The movie isn't so much about it's story but about how we feel as we watch the movie. To watch these people sing and dance and entertain is what makes the movie work. Its story is just an excuse for these people to get together. I think once you view the movie with that mind set it shouldn't disappoint. Perhaps that's what went wrong in 68. People just didn't know what to make of the movie. But whatever other may say about this film I think it's a masterpiece. A sheer joy to watch.

 Movies such as this are also a pleasure to watch because of the world they encompass. ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" wants to be an old-fashioned Hollywood musical and it transports us to the world of those films with a modern setting. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the choreographer. It reminded me of West Side Story and the work of Jerome Robbins. I also disliked the performances given by Genevieve Thenier and Grover Dale. I felt the movie worked best when it focused on the girls and their song and dance. I also enjoyed Gene Kelly's performance as Andy Miller. A man who comes to Paris to visit an old friend and bumps into the girl he thinks will turn out to be the love of his life. And Kelly knows a thing or two about Paris romances.

 Now that ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" is available on DVD and vhs I hope people take advantage of seeing this musical masterpiece.

 Bottom-line: A Visual knockout. Demy surpasses his work on ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"". This is a movie that primarily exist to put a smile on our face and bring joy to our hearts. I love this movie!",1133222400,8,4326,4.443181818181818

As always, I can't really say anything against Gene Kelly but as for the rest of the film?  Well, it is a feeble attempt at creating a french version of the Hollywood musical.  They really missed the mark but I guess it would of helped if ANY of the stars could sing.

1060709,5,6305674051,"Imagine a Monty Python version of ""Bye Bye Birdie"", set in France and featuring twin anorexic Ann Margrets; and you will have a good idea of the ""look"" of ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"". Then throw in the Hullabaloo dancers with even the males in go-go boots and be prepared to laugh. Which is appropriate because on one level Jacques Demy is gleefully and affectionately satirizing the movie musical tradition. What you are not prepared for is how, after about 40 minutes, you realize that you really like this thing.

It is fast paced, extremely original, and very pretty; ultimately its innate charm just wins you over. At the end you are shocked to find that this silly satire stands alone atop all of Demy's other films. His legacy of optimism, beauty, and unashamed sweetness.

Catherine Deneuve who is usually the 180 degree antithisis of ""perky"" has to play a lively and fairly out-there young woman. It must have been quite a struggle for Demy to get this much animation from her but her unnatural performance adds to the already surreal feel of this film. I might have cut the scene where she puts something in the oven as it reminds you of that rabbit in ""Repulsion"".

What is interesting is that early in the story Demy has let you know how his characters will be paired off by the end, then he uses a ""ships passing in the night"" device to build suspense as the viewer waits for the inevitable that never quite seems to happen. Ultimately everything falls into place and there is a charming resolution.

My only complaint is that I thought Deneuve and Jacques Perrin's ""Maxence"" should have connected one scene earlier, in the caf when he came back to get his sea-bag. This would have made a better montage when cutting between the Dorleac-Kelly and Legrand-Darrieux connections.

The best scene is a great musical montage at the midway point of the film, as the three waiting-to-be-connected story lines are reflected by cuts between three different songs occurring simultaneous in different parts of the town; with the tempo increasing with each cut.",1116288000,31,2065,4.78932584269663

1060801,5,6305674051,"This was the second French musical film made with the music of Michel LeGrand (the great French songwriter) and the beautiful blonde French actress, Catherine Deneuve (the tall, stately lady on the back of French currency was also inspired by her profile).

I wish more people knew about this movie because it is really funny , for starters (maybe even unintentionally, but somehow I think the directors and actors were well aware of how ""tongue in cheek"" they were being).  Like its predecessor, ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" the dialogue is breathlessly sung (and, of course, breathlessly dubbed by other singers), the plot is light, fluffy and ridiculous.  Two twin sisters, Delphine and Solange, own and teach at a dance school for young girls (Delphine and Solange are played by real life sisters Catherine Deneuve and Francoise Dorleac.  Unfortunately, Francoise died in a car accident quite soon after the film was made).  We get a glimpse into their lives during a whirlwind weekend when the summer carnival has come to town and love is in the air.  The love interests are a young blonde sailor who falls in love with Delphine's likeness in a painting (his ""female ideal""--the accompanying song is a hilarious and dizzyingly lovesick), and Andy Miller (Gene Kelly--dubbed over by a jazz singer's voice) who encounters Solange in the street, by chance.  Also, let's not forget the appearance of George Chakiris as Etienne, a fancy free carny who basically is living loose and free (and finds time to dance and showcase the newest model of motorcycle during the fair).

This is truly a period piece.  Some of the costumes are a real throwback to 1960s mod--complete with go-go boots and tight jeans.  The choreography is funky, edgy and definitely not from your grandmother's musicals.  (I don't think this would've been Fred Astaire's first choice for a ""cross over"" film.)  Rent this when you want a great escape from the burdens of day to day life.  This will definitely lift your spirits!",1101427200,10,1998,4.963963963963964
1060802,4,6305674051,"Firstly: this isn't a musical like 'Cherbourg'. It has only a few themes, each belonging to certain people - and you can quickly find out, that people who belong together sing the same tune, only with different words. Which is a charming idea and won me over. And it isn't the kind of fairytale that many Demy's films are. The people move about in a realistic place, doing things that at least remind things that happen in reality, but wearing things that make them and the dancers - who walk by casually and start and stop dancing absent-mindedly - stand out of others. There are very few big dancing scenes here. Even though Gene Kelly is in the cast.
The cast is great: Danielle Darrieux, Francoise Dorleac, Catherine Deneuve, George Charikis, Michel Piccoli, Gene Kelly and Jacques Perrin - with his hair blonde, wearing a sailor costume that looks like the ones little boys wear. They all seem to fit in this story that has nothing to do with real life, just happens in real surroundings. The pastel coloured clothes, the way people move without finding each other, unexpected, haphazard dancers on the streets... Apparently Demy had fun lending musical-like features while still trying to do something else. Deneuve, Dorleac and Darrieux are lovely, of course, the men are all handsome and charming (Charikis should be sold in bottles!) and the music is lovely. This time Legrand made recognizable songs, each belonging to certain people.
The plot? There isn't much to tell about. Two lovely girls, musically talented, are looking for love and a better future, their mother keeps a cafe and remembers the love of her life she rejected because the man had a silly name. The fare brings new people to Rochefort and the girls get a chance to leave, maybe to Paris. But men keep crossing their path...
Oh yes, I love this film. Even though I don't care for musicals that much. Or pure romantic soap. There is something disarming in this one, though it's useless to find great big truths of life or magnificent singers. Perhaps that's what is so charming: these people can hold a tune and dance a bit, but they aren't so good you couldn't do the same thing yourself - if you had the balls to take a few steps or to sing a nice tune as you walk down the street and feel like it.
I suppose I finally fell for this film in the end, when one of the main characters is leaving alone, then gets up on a truck and the theme grows stronger and bigger than ever. The lovers meet, though it isn't shown. And by the way: in my mind it's one of the best themes Legrand ever composed. Enjoy!",1067990400,22,2579,4.560344827586207

The music score is one of Michel Legrand's best, and the movie pays homage to An American in Paris and other musicals with the presence of Gene Kelly. Here's a film that also uses color creatively. The cast is wonderful--Catherine Deneuve, Francoise Dorleac, Danielle Darrieux, George Chakiris, Grover Dale, Michel Piccoli, Jacques Perrin, and of course, Kelly. The script gets somewhat silly--but there's so much to enjoy. Maybe Donkey Skin will get restored next--another Demy-Legrand gem starring Deneuve and Perrin.",1026691200,11,651,5.330097087378641
1060804,5,6305674051,"The Young Girls of Rochefort is the greatest movie musical ever made.  That it was French, and that it was made in 1967 were the two reasons I wanted to see it when I first heard of it in 1998.  The second the film began I knew this was going to be huge.  The colors enthusiastically splashed about the screen as was the music.  This was a film which everyone involved enjoyed making and it comes across brilliantly. Demy loved bright colors and loud, brassy music.  Catherine Deneuve and Francoise Dorleac loved each other as did their characters.  George Chakiris was just as great in a light romantic lead as he was in the most intense scences in West Side Story.  Gene Kelly seemed right at home in his role.  At any age, at any time in any film, he could sweep the ladies off their feet better than anyone on either side of the Atlantic.  This is a film which had been in my thoughts almost non-stop for the past three years and this is a film I will watch over and over again - and so will you.

1060805,4,6305674051,"I bought this video for only one reason - George Chakiris is in it.  And I still feel that his dancing was up to 'West Side Story' standards, even though he was now 34 (27/28 in 'WSS'), and so did the standard of most of the main characters.  But it is very 'French' (the feeling I get is not quite 'today' and just a little bit 'yesterday'), and the general standard of precision in the dancing is not as slick as American musicals.  Little things like the angles of the poles when they arrive in the square - not quite all the same.  Or the kicks to the side during the opening sequences are not quite all the same height.  Some dancers seem to be working on the 'one' beat, but some seem to be working on the 'one ""and""'. But having said that, it was great to see another 'modern dance' musical.  Unfortunately, and as much as I admire Gene Kelly as a dancer, he was much too old to play the part he did.  And his style of dance didn't mix right with the rest of the musical numbers.  It needed someone younger and more charismatic to play the part.  But on the whole it is an enjoyable movie, with a tangled love theme that - right up to the end - you're not quite sure is going to work out (although you know it must because it is a movie).  I will always enjoy the dance sequences (dance has no language barriers) but will find it difficult keeping my eyes on the subtitles while trying to watch George Chakiris moving across the screen.

First of all, the choreography, music and singing are often innovative and striking. Yes, there are some parts that drag, but there are others which soar.

While the story and ambience and music are just enchanting, almost everyone finds something not to like.  (Hey Leonard Maltin, give it a second chance!)  For me, the first fifteen minutes drag.  For others, the dancing is a little stale.
But once the plot begins to unwind - it's an amazing contraction of memorable, endearing characters, missed connections, and romantic plot twists.  The music and the lyrics are to die for.  (The English titles vary a little, since they are composed to rhyme also in English rather than exactly match the French.)  A number of reviews and web sites can be found through any major internet search engine - there's a small international cult following for this distinctive film.  Two sisters and their mother, and three men, all seek love in a small French city.  Everyone knows at least one or two other characters - yet none of the true couples ever meets!

But unfortunately the movie is not restored in stereo and Catherine's part is pretty small then 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'.
But the good thing is the music is added with the gorgeous dances and it was marvelous and hillarious to watch.
Not like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg', there is not dark and glummy side at all in this movie. It is all pretty and fun.
Two twin are all about searching for love. And even their mother is yearning for her true love, actually her husband who is their daughter's father.
As I said, Catherine's part is small and the other twin sister's part is bigger. Her name is Franoise Dorlac. she meets this guy Gene Kelly and falls in love with him instantly. As you may imagined, Gene Kelly is a legendary American Actor who is in this movie but with a small roll this time. He was great although his part is small.

There is this memorable scenes I want to share.
One is when Franoise Dorlac is talking about herself and the people in her mother's coffee shop are responding all together by singing in chorus. It was so cool and touching, original to me.
The other scene was The montage sequence of fast look showing each actor's mental state with the music. It was also very original for me.

Throughout the movie dance is the chore tool and it is even important then dialogue. I never seen anything cheerful like that. I was even tapping my toes during watching it. It was so happy for me watching this movie for exactly 2 hours.

If 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' is the the negative pole, this movie is the the positive pole. I am not saying one is good and one is bad.
Both are great films and I am so greatful to have both. And if someone asks me which one is better, I cannot tell.

This movie is more of a jazz music based and 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'  is more of a mixture of classic and jazz.

Anyway last night was another memorable time for me watching this film.
