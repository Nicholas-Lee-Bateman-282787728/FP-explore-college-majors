What it does have going for it are some great actors who were picked locally by the director/writer.  The  story is a pretty straight-forward-by-the-book tale of love and betrayl in  a post-00 society.  Big deal...we've all watched USA at 2am.  What sticks  out about this film are the comic bits as well as its dedication to its own  story (it doesn't come up short in the end).  All of the actors did a  remarkable job (with the exception of Alex...the only actor from LA), and  some of the lighting and dream sequences are well above par.  Over all,  rent it if you can, buy it if you must....but don't judge too harshly...or  a man in horn rims and a goofy hat may just come knocking at your door  around January 1st.",946252800,,834,4.34640522875817
