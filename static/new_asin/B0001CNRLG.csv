1988827,3,B0001CNRLG,"While the new slim packaging is nice and I can't argue the price, there are two things I find wrong with the Dracula Legacy collection. First of all, the production notes for all the films were left off. Why? I sold my Son of/Daughter of disc in anticipation of this coming out, so now I've lost them. But more importantly, the sound on the original Dracula film is, to my ears, much worse than the 1999 release- certain words are now inaudible- and since I saved my Dracula disc, I can verify this. Whereas before, dialogue was given a boost- it hasn't now and it's just a monotonous blur. The transfer still remains bad, but I can't say which one is better or if it is actually the same print. Keep these criticisms in mind, if given the choice between buying the original discs (which lack HOD) and the new set. I haven't seen anyone else complain about the audio differences in other reviews...",1083801600,3,898,4.4817073170731705
1988828,5,B0001CNRLG,"Finally, all classic 5 Dracula films finally come to DVD in this amazing collection. These films inspired dozens of directors and producers to bring you a new taste in horror. Bela Lugosi was truly the best Dracula ever. He has been scaring people for more than 70 years! If you are a true horror film classic kind of person, you definitely need to buy this mega collection. This collection includes Dracula (bela lugosi film) the Spanish version of the film (some people say it is better than the Bela Lugosi version) Dracula's daughter (made in 1936) son of Dracula (made in 1943) and house of Dracula (made in 1945). This is a must get collection for a spooky night.
I have looked through the features and this is what I thought. Well, there is a behind the scenes look at the production of the film hosted by the director of ""Van Helsing"" Stephen Sommers. This behind the scenes look shows behind the scenes of Van helsing of how this film helps the production. Interviews by classic film historians, and big fans of the film.
Note: This isn't a behind the scenes look at Dracula, it is a behind the scenes look at Van Helsing, and it shows how this film influenced the Van Helsing in production. There's about 6 minutes and 30 seconds of this.
Then there's a road to Dracula. A 30 minute behind the scenes look of the production of Dracula. This includes interviews by film historians, fans of the films, and of course Bela Lugosi's son. This is an interesting documentary on this film, this gave information I never new! I also discovered the trailer for all 5 films. I can't believe they still have them. You'd figure they would have thrown them out already.
Overall this is a must get collection for true horror fans. If you love horror movies, go back to the origin of the new age horror films. A must buy!",1083542400,3,1815,4.536585365853658
1988829,2,B0001CNRLG,"Dracula (1931) is the original cinematic story about a Transylvanian count (Bela Lugosi) who must suck the blood of innocents in order to survive. He sleeps by day, terrorizes by night and keeps a crew of virgin wives as his slaves in the darkened recesses of his haunted castle. Of course, it's up to Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) to put an end to all the blood letting and bandages.

The subsequent films in this collection are a mixed bag of B-pictures; the best probably being, Dracula's Daughter, because of Gloria Holden's compelling performance as Countess Marya. At least she attempts to pick up where the original nightmare left off.

The last two films (Son... and House of...) are truly laughable. But the real revelation in this collection is the Spanish version of the original film, Dracula. Produced simultaneously with the original film and on the same sets, it is an improvement on the Lugosi version in both its camera techniques and visual special effects. One pines for such originality elsewhere in this collection.

The transfers are a mixed bag at best. No attempt has been made to clean up the age related artifacts that riddle the print of the 1931 original horror classic. It is so extensively marred by every conceivable anomaly (scratches, excessive film grain, tears in the original camera negative, fading) that it is a painful viewing experience. Contrast and black levels are so unbalanced that fine detail is not even an issue - (personally, I'd be happy to see any detail at all.) There is also a considerable amount of digital anomalies that only add to the frustration of watching film history being destroyed before your very eyes. The audio of the original film is muffled, often inaudible and suffers greatly from background hiss, pops and a strident characteristic. The subsequent films in this collection are spared such massive deterioration, presumably because they did not get as much play time over the years and as a result have been better preserved.

As with the Frankenstein box set, extras include two succinctly produced featurettes, theatrical trailers, audio commentaries and a shameless promotion for ?Van Helsing? the disastrous contemporary retelling of these characters, starring Hugh Jackman.

I cannot in good faith recommend this box set, even to die hard ""Dracula"" fans, because the original film - the only one in which Lugosi appears - has been rendered in such poor condition on DVD. A genuine disappointment!",1083456000,6,2484,5.06356968215159
1988830,4,B0001CNRLG,"I give this collection a solid four stars for the release, finally, of all the Universal Dracula films, which includes the essential ""House of Dracula"", but not perhaps for the reason you might first expect (more on that in a moment).  All five are in a very nice double-disk jewel case.  The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star is the obvious lack of extras, including some that were on the earlier double-feature Univeral set of ""Dracula's Daughter"" and ""Son of Dracula"".  Granted, the missing extras from the original double-feature release were only Production Notes, but even this was better than nothing at all.  Or in this case, only the theatrical trailers.  Also, for such an anticipated release as ""House of"", why were there no extras?  But this is perhaps minor, when fans like myself have been hoping for some time for this final chapter in...Dracula's life?  Nope, in poor Larry Talbot's cursed life.
Yep, that's why I love this movie so much.  Out of all the Universal Monsters, only Lon Chaney Jr. played the same creature in every movie it appeared, and only he played the tortured soul of Larry Talbot.  And with the release of ""House of Dracula"", Larry finally hits a home run.  He's cured of the curse, he kills the bad guy, and he gets the leading lady.  For many of us who loved all the Univeral wolfman films, seeing Larry finally getting his ""Happy Ending"" is like reading the last in a series of very satisfying novels.  This movie packs all the Univeral Monsters into a plot that's much more complex than some of the earlier films, and includes the return of some beloved Univeral characters actor, like Lionel Atwill.
The picture quality of all the films is, for the most part, clean and satisfying.  There are some signs of age that you would have thought Universal could have completely cleaned up, but to me they seem minor. The sound is sharp and clear.  The new score by Philip Glass for the ""Dracula"" dvd (it includes both the new score, and the original 1932 score) adds a whole new dimension to watching it.  I also love the new sound effects in the main menu, with wind rustling, and bats squeaking and fluttering.  Included on disk one are a few of the extras from the original dvd release, like ""On the Road to Dracula"", and an audio commentary by film historian David J. Skal.  There are theatrical trailors for all the films, and a newly remastered audio track.  And for those anticipating the release of ""Von Helsing"" in theaters this year, there is an original, short-running, behind-the-scenes documentary on disk one.",1082937600,7,2566,4.702460850111857

1988887,5,B0001CNRLG,"All of the Legacy Collection entries are a godsend for Universal monster movie fans. And the Dracula entry is no exception. Let's start with the supposed ""lesser"" of all of the films in the collection, ""House Of Dracula"".

What a goofy and totally entertaining film it is. Picture this - Count Dracula, the Prince Of Darkness, laying down on a gurney in a white hospital gown getting a transfusion. Nuff said? And how about the doctor/ scientist of the story who has the luck to have Count Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstien's Monster show up on his doorstep - in the same day! Unfortunately, the writer could't figure out how to get them all in the same scene doing battle, either against each other, or together against the obligatory villagers carrying torches storming the castle.

None of this matters, because House Of Dracula is just great fun. So allow me to affectionately point out some other absurdities and strengths of the flick. My next question is, what is Larry (The Wolf Man) Talbot doing sporting a mustache? Why would a guy who hates growing hair and fangs be doing having hair over his upper lip? Crazy! And..what is Dracula doing in this doctor's castle looking to be ""cured"" of his vampirism, his supposed motivation for being there. First of all, a vampire is a dead person kept alive unnaturally by drinking the blood of humans. He is dead. How can you cure a dead person of anything? Without his vampirism, he would't be able to exist. So, you cure his vampirism and The Prince Of Darkness remains a regular guy now? I don't think so. The first time we see Dracula is as a bat and then transformed, peering into the doctor's sleeping nursing assistant's window. That's why Dracula is there, obviously. Especially when we find out later that he actually knows the woman, having met her at some resort or something. And if that is true, why the pretense of wanting to be cured of his vampirism? Dracula could't just put the bite on her then and there?

And then, again, as in House Of Frankenstein (the previous film in the series) Dracula trusts his resting place - his coffin - to a mere mortal. And not just a mortal, but an admittedly ""religious man"". Where? Right inside the basement door! I love it! Not only that, but the good doctor happens on the count hovering over his nurse no fewer than three times and it doesn't raise any red flags? Now that's liberal thinking! He's not undead evil, he's sick!

Larry ""Wolf Man"" Talbot is so distraught about having to face another full moon that he decides to kill himself. How? He takes a careful leap, feet first, into - not the rocks below the seaside cliff - but into the deepest part of the water. In all of the Wolf Man/ Frankenstein films, I'm pretty sure that was never on the list of how to kill a werewolf.  No matter, if he didn't do that, we wouldn't have that cool scene of him almost killing the good doctor, who (seemingly way more suicidal) ventures down into a dark cave to find the Wolf Man. The first thing Talbot says to him after transforming back in the nick of time is ""I could have killed you.""  LOL. Duh!

The plot thickens when Dracula, instead of drinking the blood of everyone in the room during his transfusion, instead, takes the time to turn the taps and infects the blood of the doctor. How does he miss the opportunity to at least bite the other hunchbacked nurse? So the doctor turns into a kind of Mr. Hyde/Dracula hybrid. Still alive, he nonetheless loses his reflection in a mirror and even takes on Hyde like features. He is a better vampire than the Count, though, ripping his faithful handyman's throat out on a trip into town. Again, no blood and not looking ay worse for wear when he gets back home in time to answer the door of the police who have tracked him, literally, to his own doorstep.

They want to talk to Larry Talbot, who has been witnessed by the inspector himself (the last film role for the immortal Lionel Atwill), turning into the Wolf Man. Larry is indignant that he should be suspected. Huh? Who else would they suspect?

Crazy, fun stuff. There are some very effective moments. I love all Wolf Man footage, so it's great to see him, no matter how meager the offering. Carradine as Dracula, as someone else's review accurately pointed out, is more like a ham Shakespearian actor than the positively otherworldly Bela Lugosi. Still, his scene of turning the nurse to him by his evil presence and not from an outright attack is fantastic. The Monster? Poor Glen Strange. The immortal monster is found in the sludge below the good doctor's castle in Vasaria, the home town of Boris Karloff's mad scientist in the previous ""House Of Frankenstien"". He knows the entire story of the previous film, but Larry Talbot (having just turned back from the furry one) neglects to admit that, ""yea, I know. I was there!""

The end has Lon Chaney informing the townspeople, ""It's the Frankenstein Monster!"" The film then intercuts Chaney fleeing with the nurse and Chaney from Ghost Of Frankenstein's fiery finally with him as the Monster! What can I say? Good, clean fun.

""Dracula's Daughter"" is another weird, fun movie. and another vampire wanting to be cured of vampirism. since this storyline preceded House Of Dracula, maybe it ""borrowed"". Either way, it's a silly idea. Somehow, though, we buy it here. Dracula's daughter is, obviously a woman, and maybe that is why we are inclined to go with it. But it is Gloria Holden's performance of ""Countess Veleska"" that makes her somewhat sympathetic. She has that otherworldly quality that the great Lugosi brought to the screen and is convincing in her desire to escape the ""curse"" that makes her a bloodthirsty fiend. This time it is a psychological approach that is attempted, her vampirim treated as an addiction. Doesn't matter. It's a cute and creepy little flick, with kudos to Erving Pichell as Countess Veleska's major doom, a sinister presence and some ways more vampiric than she. all he wants is for her to bite on him and make him immortal as well. Bad luck, I suppose to be the servant of the only vampire around who hates being one. A silly romantic comedy storyline between the ""Van Helsing"" type character and his assistant adds a little levity to the proceedings. The often mentioned lesbian bent of the Countess I always found a little bit much. The countess looks at all her victims in this desirous way. If anything, she makes her play for the male Van Helsing character in the worst way, so I never understood the lesbian subtext angle. Anyway, another minor gem from Universal.

If ""Dracula's Daughter"" is a minor gem, then ""Son Of Dracula"" is their Transylvanian rhinestone. Dracula has stowed away to deep south America and is calling himself Count Alucard (Dracula spelled backwards). Why? I suppose so he doesn't raise the alarm bells. No matter that he's being helped by the resident occult groupie who has lured him here to be made a vampire herself and then plans on destroying him so she can turn her boyfriend into an immortal fiend like her. Crazy, huh? And a lot of fun as well. An interesting and entertaining film with lots of cool, spooky moments. Now.. Lon Chaney Jr. as Dracula. Yes, he is miscast as the Prince OF Darkness. He is on the pudgy side, but maybe because of that blood he is glutting himself on? It's a stretch, I know. but who cares? Dracula in America riding in cars is goofy and cool. The real problem with Chaney's Dracula is that, as usual, he looks like he is about to cry. Chaney had that down pat. And again, not a very effective vampire. In the scene where he confronts the Van Helsing type character, he grabs the throat of the doctor with him and not the one of the guy in the room that is actually a potential threat to him, who promptly whips out a cross, forcing the vampire to almost cry and turn into a cloud of vapor.

A really neat scene is when Dracula's coffin pops up from the bottom of a misty pond and Dracula forms out of a mist to stand like a goulash surfer on his coffin as it floats to the shore. Absolutely ridiculous but cool. His lover is a neat little cooky made of arsenic. Just a crazy zapped out character, she isn't satisfied to be the heir to a planation and lots of money. No, she invites the Prince Of Darkness to her house, where he promptly kills her father and spiritual guru (Queen Zimba), destroys her boyfriend, puts the bite on a little kid and makes her a vampire. A fun and totally off beat Dracula film. It was cool to have Chaney be able to play all four major Universal monsters (Frankenstein's Monster, The Mummy, Dracula and, of course, The Wolf Man.

To have the original Dracula, it's Spanish version (in a lot ways, a superior film), the great, weird Dracula's Daughter and Chaney's miscasting as Son Of Dracula in one package is great. Just buy this collection!",1423180800,,8843,4.5886075949367084

1988904,5,B0001CNRLG,"What's better to do on a dark and stormy night than to turn on the DVD and watch some horror movies right? This is the ultimate collection of classic Universal vampire horror! Whether you choose the original 1931 version of Dracula with Bela Lugosi, the 1931 Spanish version with Carlos Villaras, 1936's Dracula's Daughter featuring Gloria Holdent as the count's daughter Countess Marya Zaleska, 1943's Son of Dracula with Lon Chaney Jr playing Count Alucard (Dracula spelled backwards), or 1945's House of Dracula featuring John Carradine as the undead Dracula together with Frankenstein, and the Wolfman! All of the movies in this set had a two channel mono soundtrack with English, Spanish, and French subtitles.  Dracula also has an optional original score for the movie writen by Phillip Glass and preformed by the Kronos Quartet in 5.1.  Though this sounded very good, and the music fit with the movie, I prefer the original soundtrack that I grew up with.

The sound quality was about what you would expect for movies of this age.  There was some hiss and the occasional instance of background noise, but these were not distracting.  The dialog was clear and easy to hear, and the sound effects, while not forceful and dynamic, did not distort.  Dracula had the worst sound of the lot, with a good amount of hiss and many pops in some areas, which was unfortunate.  Overall, a good sounding set of movies.

The extras from the original releases are all present in this set, a wise movie on Universal's part.  They originally provided a very comprehensive set of bonus material, and I was very glad to see them all included.

There is also a new 6  minute promotional piece with writer/director Stephen Sommers talking about the Dracula movies interspersed with clips from the originals and his new monster movie, Van Helsing.  This was a fluff piece, and I can't see myself watching it again.

There is a 35-minute featurette, The Road to Dracula, hosted by Carl Laemmle's neice, Carla.  This is a great documentary covering the history of Dracula from the original novel, the play, Nosferatu, and the making of the 1931 film.  There is a lot of information in this bonus, a top notch extra.

Film Historian David J. Skal provides a commentary track to Dracula. This is a great track, with Skal providing information not only on the making of Dracula, but the differences between the film version in and the novel and play.  He makes comparisons between the original shooting script and what made it to the final cut, and compares the English and Spanish versions.  If only all commentaries could be this informative.

There is also a picture gallery with production photos and movie posters, and trailers to all the movies.

They are simply put, masterpieces, especially the first films.

But Dracula was the first Universal Monster.  Watching the film, I enjoyed the scenery and effort put into the movie.

1988947,5,B0001CNRLG,"Dracula, the legacy collection features 5 movies from the Universal pictures film library. The legendary ""Dracula""--made timeless by the performance of the renowned Bela Lugosi & a movie that seems to come in for a lot of knocks by film historians & fans alike. No doubt, the movie has its flaws & the ending is less than stellar, but one can't deny the power of Lugosi's portrayal of the immortal count or Edward Van Sloan's great portrayal of his nemesis, Professor Van Helsing. I actually prefer Dracula to the original and much more revered ""Frankenstein"" that came out the same year in 1931.

The Spanish version of Dracula, is the second film in the collection & a lot of people tout it as being better than Lugosi's Dracula. I personally didn't see what all the fuss was about. I'm not saying it's a bad movie but better than the American version, no way. And don't even get me started on Carlos Villar's hammy & over the top performance as Dracula. Doesn't come close to touching Lugosi.

""Dracula's Daughter"" was a movie that I had never seen before & I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Likewise, the much maligned ""Son of Dracula"" was much better than its reputation would have you believe.

Unfortunately, the collection doesn't end on a high note, ""House of Dracula"" is a rather dry & mundane ""monster mash"" movie & the last in the Universal monster series, at least before the monsters met Abbott and Costello.

Overall, while I'm not the biggest fan of the ""House"" movie, I still rate this a full 5 stars--mainly on the strength of the 4 movies that proceed it.",1368921600,4,1587,4.637010676156583
1988948,3,B0001CNRLG,"""Dracula: The Legacy Collection"" includes five films - the original 1931 ""Dracula"" with Bela Lugosi, ""Dracula: The Spanish Version"", ""Dracula's Daughter"", ""Son of Dracula"", and ""House of Dracula"".

Let me state right now that the earlier DVD release of the 1931 ""Dracula"" film has a lot better audio and picture. Renfield's screams as he dies can't be heard nor can Dracula's multiple groans when he is staked through the heart. There are a lot of hisses in the audio and sometimes you can't hardly hear what people are saying. I don't know why, but they used a pourer quality version of the film in this collection. So if you are buying this mainly for the first film, I suggest buying the earlier DVD release rather than this one. But if you already have the earlier DVD release and you want the other films, then definitely buy this collection.

First we have ""Dracula"" with the iconic Bela Lugosi in the role of the Transylvanian vampire. For a lover of Bram Stoker's story, a film buff, and a lover of actors Bela Lugosi, Edward Van Sloan, and Dwight Frye as I am then this is definitely worth watching. Bela Lugosi as Dracula, Edward Van Sloan as Vampire Hunter Professor Van Helsing, and Dwight Frye as the mad Renfield are all excellent in this film, Director Tod Browning does a great job at creating an eerie atmosphere, and the visuals are qiute good considering it was made back in 1931. But it does play better as a stage play rather than a film. I blame the studio for that. They wanted to use the play stage adamption of the story in order to save on costs, and because of that the film is lacking somewhat. Same with the censors. They were incrediably strict in those days and because of that the film is also lacking in horror and action. The best Tod Browning could do was at least make it as eerie as possible by using darkness, fog, and cobwebs... and he did do a marvelous job on that. It makes a great stage play, but it could have been a lot better film if it wasn't for the censors and studio. I mainly like it because I am a lover of Bram Stoker's classic tale and love Bela Lugosi, Edward Van Sloan, and Dwight Frye. The newly added musical score (which is optional) also could have made it better if it didn't have the music in every single little bit of the movie. It worked great in some areas of the film, but in others not so much. It was overused and bacuse of that the original score is much better. But to enjoy the original to the fullest, you really need to buy the earlier DVD release.

Then you have ""Dracula's Daughter"" which was a bit of disappointment. The only good things about this one is the excellent acting and the comical bits that are incorperated into the piece. But I found the story to be a complete bore, and it's not even eerie like the first Dracula film.

I'm not to fond of the spanish Dracula, but only because I don't speak spanish. I did watch it once, and found that like the english version it's got its ups and downs, but if you do speak spanish then it might be quite enjoyable. One thing I liked better about this version is that it wasn't stricted by American censors so they could get away with more in this version than in the english version, like the destruction of Lucy's vampire which wasn't featured in the egnlish version due to it being ""too violent and scary"".

Next is ""Son of Dracula"" which I found to be the best film in this collection. It's got a great story, it's exciting, it's eerie, and it's got a great cast. It stars Lon Chany Jr. as the son of the imfamous Transylvanian vampire, best known for his protrayal of the hairy werewolf in ""The Wolf Man"" movies. And since the censors weren't as strict when this film was made, they were able to have a lot more horror and action in this one.

Last is ""House of Dracula"", a great old Universal horror film which not only features Dracula in it, but also features the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster, a mad doctor, a hunchback assistant, and a Jekl and Hide-like character in it. I really liked this film and consider it the second best in this collection.

Overall, if you like old Universal horror pictures then I do recommended this Legacy set. I just think they could have done a better job, and transferred a better quality version of the original ""Dracula"" film to this collection instead of the pour quality version featured on this set. I recommend buying the earlier DVD release of the original ""Dracula"" before perchasing this DVD set.",1361491200,3,4477,4.465770171149145

1988952,2,B0001CNRLG,"The Dracula-Legacy Collection from Universal made it's arrival to my apartment in a satisfactory amount of time (less than a week). It was two discs, one with one side for the main feature movie and the other a dual-side disc for the other four movies. The first movie was viewed with 100% good picture quality, sound, and special features. This disc was not damaged. The other dual-side was scratched on both sides as it had fallen out of place from it's holder inside of the DVD case. I tried playing the disc on my laptop and it could not even read the disc. On my DVD player, the disc stopped on scenes, skipped from section to section of the movie, and all in all, I couldn't even finish watching any movie feature on the dual-side. Dual-discs, in particular, are hard to take care of, because both sides of the disc are in danger of damaging marks that could interfere with the selection contents of the DVD.

1988964,4,B0001CNRLG,"I bought this collection the same time I purchased the Wolf Man collection (at $18 bucks).

Bela Lugosi will always be Dracula, but was also his career killer. A shame Hollywood couldn't reconcile the iconic character with the awesome actor, but stereotyping is one of Hollywood's worse vices.

Dracula does not follow Bram Stoker's novel but is spooky and gothic and also features Dwight Frye (yeah, the guy Alice Cooper wrote a song about) eating bugs. I am not a vampire fan, per se, but I loved this version as much as Christopher Lee and Gary Oldman's turns. Lusosi brought an authenticity to Drac that has never been duplicated, only mimicked by amateurs. For me, vampires should be feared not lusted after; otherwise, they're not monsters nor is it a horror movie.

The Spanish version is a better directed affair but follows the Lugosi version virtually scene for scene (and is remarkably longer).

Dracula's Daughter is a sequel, but lacks both the atmosphere of the original and the sexual undercurrent.

Son of Dracula stars Lon Chaney Jr. as Count Alucard (Dracula backwards) and, while not a superior film to the original, it is certainly an equal. One of Chaney's better efforts.

House of Dracula is part of the crossover run between Franky, Drac and the Wolf Man from the 1940's, and you can find a few good moments. John Carradine is Drac.

I was not displeased with this collection, even though the original still has serious audio issues.

Also, you get not just Mexican Spanish, but Castillian and South American Spanish as well (there are some differences in pronunciation).  I was so impressed with it that I gave 2 copies to my college Spanish language instructor.",1332806400,,583,5.041666666666667
1988967,5,B0001CNRLG,"Count Dracula has been portrayed in various novels, comic books, video games, and films, but none of those interpretations have ever become as iconic as that of Bela Lugosi. Bela Lugosi simply IS Dracula and this classic collection is worth the purchase.

Dracula (1931, staring Bela Lugosi, Dwight Frye, Edward Van Sloan) was an amaznig film from start to finish. The mountains of Transylvania made you feel like you were in another world. The performances by listed actors were absolutelty incredible and really carried the movie. The beginning moments when the woman vampire sat out of the coffin was very chilling. Bela Lugosi's transformations were very scary too, because you did not see them.

Spanish Dracula (1931, staring Carlos Vilar and Lupita Tovar) was shot along side the English speaking classic. In some ways, this is a superior film to the English version. When Dracula emerges from the coffin we hear scary music and see smoke. We actually see bite marks on a victim's neck in a close up. There are slight improvements over the English version, but Carlos Vilar was no Bela Lugosi with all due respect. Still this was a chilling and atmospheric version of the story.

Dracula's Daughter (staring Gloria Holden was a very well made sequel. It kept with the tradition of no reflection in mirrors and even made that a story element. Gloria was scary in this film. This film was also a very early piece of lesbian homoerotic story telling. The gothic atmosphere stayed true to the two films that came before it as well.

Son of Dracula (staring Lon Chaney Jr.) was a more technology filled film. Here we watched as Dracula turned into bats and fog. We watched him literally float on water. Lon was a very authoritative count.

House of Dracula (staring John Carradine and Lon Chaney Jr.) was a monster romp featuring John Carradine's elegant portrayal of Count Dracula, Lon Chaney Jr. as the always amazing Wolf Man, Glen Strange as the Frankenstein Monster for two seconds, and a good doctor who turned into a (half?) Vampire. I was kind of confused as to just what the doctor was. Was he half vampire like Renfield in Dracula? Over all, I think this was a fun movie. I loved the Wolf Man transformation in the jail cell.

As far as Extras goes on this collection, you have The Road to Dracula (which was not new when this collection came out) which is a very informative documentry for a first time viewer. You have Stephen Sommers paying respect to the films that none of his films can ever be. David Skal offers a very insightful commentary track on the original film. You also get trailers and poster galleries and an alternate score for the original film.

All in all, the films are great and so are the extras. The movies look and sound great in this set. The only movie that is not perfect by the standards of all the rest of them in the collection is the Lugosi Dracula. It is not the best picture of sound version of that film. Do not worry though because Universal is releasing it on Blu-ray this year. So I would still get this set for all the sequels and pick up the Blu-rays of the Lugosi and Spanish versions of Dracula when they hit shelves.",1327622400,3,3172,4.64349376114082

1989003,4,B0001CNRLG,"Back before there was a Team Edward, or before vampires had diaries, or before anyone ever heard of Sooki, there was Dracula. The first vampire. And he wasn't interested in finding love, or redeeming his past sins. He was the bad guy, and he was perfectly happy being the bad guy. People were food to him, and nothing more. Occasionally, he'd find a woman he liked more than most, and he'd make her one of his vampire brides, but it had nothing to do with love. He just did it because he could, and because no one else could stop him. When you think of Dracula, you think of the image made popular in this film. With a very strange release date of February 14 1931, it's 80 years old, and still influences the horror genre today. There are 3 versions of the original in this set. The English version, starring the only true Dracula, Bela Lugosi, with or without a music score written by Philip Glass, and the simultaneously shot Spanish version with Carlos Villar.

The Lugosi version is probably the most famous Dracula in the world today. Every pop-culture image of Dracula, with the midnight black hair and dapper evening dress and pronounced widows peak was modeled after this film. Oddly enough, though Dracula is usually depicted today with his widows peak, Bela didn't have one. I don't know where it came from.

There are those that consider the Spanish version to be a better film, but I disagree. Having just watched it for the first time last night, right after I watched the English version, I have to say I liked the English version more, due to it's better acting as the three principal characters.

Eduardo Arozamena's Van Helsing was good, but Edward Van Sloan's was just a little bit better. Arozamena just had too many goofy looking facial expressions for my taste, where Van Sloan had an air about him that told you this guy knew what he was talking about, and if you were smart, you'd listen to him and live longer. One scene in particular, where Van Helsing stops Mina from attacking John, Arozamena simply walks up and holds a cross in her face, whereas Van Sloan moved with a sense of urgency, as though life and death were at stake. That extra effort on his part is what separates an actor, from a man simply playing a part, and going through the motions.

Dwight Frye captured Renfield much better than Pablo Alvarez Rubio. Where Rubio constantly laughed maniacally, and was rather annoying about it, Frye had an evil sounding laugh. Now I know this movie isn't scary anymore, not with all the real horror in the world, but the scene where police discover Frye's Renfield in the ship's hold is one of the only scenes left in any movie that can make my skin crawl. The way Karl Freund, the veteran cameraman, framed him, the way the light hit just so, that evil laugh and his eyes growing madder by the second. Has to be seen. Frye looks like he'll jump through the screen and kill you any second. Probably caused a few heart attacks in 1931.

Lupita Tovar's Eva was far superior to Helen Chandler's Mina, and Barry Norton was far less annoying than David manners as Juan and John Harker, respectively. Chandler's performance was as dry as sandpaper, while Manners' attempts at being macho and manly were laughable. Manners was about as macho as my kid sister. That may have had to do with how he disapproved of how the production was handled throughout the movie. Director Tod Browning was less than enthused about making the film, once his preferred leading man, and close friend, Lon Chaney Sr. passed away in 1930, shortly before production began. As a result, he would often abandon the set, leaving cameraman Karl Freund as acting director. Manners stated in an interview before he died, that he never watched the movie.

An often overlooked character is Charles Gerrard's Martin, the asylum's security chief. Gerrard was far more entertaining than his Spanish double.

The Spanish version, I thought, had a better script. Plus, the benefit of shooting at night, after the English version was done for the day. The Spanish crew would come in, see what the English had done and then try to top it. Visually, in some places, they did. Specifically when Dracula woke and left his coffin. But the reason I like the English version better is exactly the reason I don't like todays so-called horror movies. The acting. The acting and their imaginations were all they had. Little to no visual effects, absolutely no CGI and director Tod Browning got better results by NOT showing you what happened and letting your imagination run away with you.

And, of course, Bela Lugosi. Carlos Villar had some of the dumbest facial expressions of any vampire I've ever seen. Bela nailed it. He had a charm that all Draculas since lacked. The spotlights on his eyes by Karl Fruend made it almost impossible to look away. And he didn't even need them, really. Bela could creep you out without any help from visual effects. He was master of this role. He really, with Frye and Van Sloan, carried the picture.

There are plenty of goofs which are quite noticeable in the film. In the scene with John and Mina on the balcony, if you look close you can tell it's in a room painted to appear as if it's outside. You can see where the walls meet in the corner. It's 1931. Talkies and even movies in general were in their infancy. You have to expect a few mistakes. Plus, it was the beginning of the Great Depression. The studio had planned to make a big budget thriller, but the money dried up, and they had to go with what they had. I can live with it. Particularly when you make up for it with killer shots of Castle Dracula in the Transylvainaian mountains. That is one ominous looking building, shot beautifully. Most of Fruend's camera work was excellent. Also, the heavy English mist hanging over the run-down Carfax Abbey and the train station where the rather pretty flower girl met her end, and the spooky looking, twisted dead trees. In all, this one opened the door for horror movies of the '30's. I preferred it without the Glass music, as I thought there were times the music was there when it wasn't needed or wanted. Plus the eerie silence is perfect when you watch it in a dark room on a chill October night.

The sequel, Dracula's Daughter, featured Gloria Holden as a female bloodsucker who delivered a Lugosi-esque performance that sat very well with me. She had an old world elegance about her on her quest to rid herself of the curse of the vampire, accompanied by her creepy man servant Sandor, played by Irving Pichel. Edward van Sloan returns as Van Helsing and delivers another fine performance as he helps Otto Kruger's Jeffery Garth rescue his love Janet, played by Marguerite Churchill, from the evil Countess who, unable to rid herself of the curse, seeks to use Janet to lure Garth into her trap and make him her undead husband. Holden's excellent self loathing performance could possibly be attributed to her not really wanting to be in the movie, as she thought horror films were low class, and beneath her. But her distaste for the role made her portrayal of her character so much the better. She, Pichel and Van Sloan really drove this movie. This was the last horror film produced by the Leammle's. The family was in deep debt, and lost the studio shortly after production. Universal would not make another horror film for three years.

1943's Son of Dracula, starring Lon Chaney Jr. was not so well done as it predecessors. I found it a valiant effort that, sadly, fell on it's face. I think at this point Universal had begun what was inevitable. Keep making sequels until we suck every dime we can from the Dracula name. In this one Count Alucard (spell it backwards) comes to, wait for it, LOUISIANA!!! Yeah, stupid ain't it? This was a case of a rather good story, overpowered by weak acting. The two female co-leads, Louise Allbritton and Chaney's frequent lady co-star, Evelyn Ankers, were left to carry the film, as Kay and Claire Calwell, respectively. Kay was always interested in the occult, and had called Alucard to Dark Oaks, so she could marry him, with the plan to become immortal, herself. J. Edward Bromberg filled in the Van Helsing role, as Professor Lazlow, but he wasn't near as good as Van Sloan was. Robert Paige's Frank Stanley was mostly a wimp, who seemed in over his head, but he does make a decision at the end that takes a great deal of strength and courage. But by then, it was too late to help the movie. As for the title role, I have much respect for the junior Chaney, but this role wasn't for him. He just didn't have the vampire charm of Holden and the master, Lugosi. In one scene towards the beginning, Alucard knocks at the door of the plantation house and is told by the butler that the elderly family patriarch has died and the family is not accepting visitors. In response Chaney's Count angrily bellows ""Announce me!"" Lugosi would have just stared at the butler until his will overpowered him. He also had some of the silliest facial expressions since Carlos Villar, in the original film's Spanish version. The only other thing that saved this movie at all were the spooky sets. Dark Oaks was a dark and dreary place, but the best set was the very creepy Bayou bog that Alucard kept his coffin in. There is a killer visual of Chaney floating across the bog that is actually very good for 1943. This film also features the first on camera transformation of Dracula into a bat, as in the original movie, transformation was implied through careful cut-aways in the camera work. Alucard transformed from mist in several scenes, as well. But that's all the movie had, was the special effects. Watching it I could tell they were getting away from the acting and more toward throwing money into a movie with the ""more is better"" mindset. Sometimes it is. This wasn't one of them. As I said, it wasn't a bad movie, but with a different cast, I think it could have been so much better. Another interesting fact, with this film, Chaney became the only actor to portray Universal's biggest monsters to that point: The Frankenstein creature, the Mummy Kharis, Dracula, and his signature role, the Wolf Man.

As bad as Chaney was in Son, John Carradine's portrayal of the vampire king in 1945's House of Dracula was worse. He doesn't even look creepy. This film is related to Dracula in that he's in it and his name's on the box. Mostly it was about the Wolf Man who starred in it along with the Frankenstein creature in a second attempt at joining all of Universal's heavy hitters in one movie. By now the magic had been lost. The tag line featured Dracula! The Frankenstein Creature! The Wolf Man! A Mad Doctor! A Hunchback! Dracula sucked, the Frankenstein Creature was barely in it, The Wolf Man carried it, the Mad Doctor didn't even get Mad until the very end, and the Hunchback wasn't evil. She was the doctor's poor nurse who had a severe medical problem. Other than her spinal issues, I thought she was quite pretty.

On the first disc you'll find all the extras. There's a fairly good documentary hosted by Carla Laemmle, a trailer for the Dracula re-release, a poster montage, and a commentary track with film historian David J. Skal. All in all, the set as a whole is rather good. One groundbreaking film, one fairly good sequel, another that was alright, but not quite as good as it could have been, and one absolute stink bomb. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is lack of mention of the sequel films in the documentary Road to Dracula. In all the other Legacy sets the sequels are at least mentioned in the commentaries, if not gone into in depth. But when the only reason I'm down-grading a star is because of the documentary, doesn't that tell you what a classic this is? From back when the night was really scary. And vampires didn't sparkle.",1317600000,,11838,4.615384615384615
1989004,1,B0001CNRLG,"I recently ordered the Dracula, Frankenstein, and Wolfman Legacy collections. I ordered them all from different sellers listed on the particular Amazon page. I have received the Dracula and Wolfman sets. Neither was acceptable.
  The Dracula set would not play at all. I tried the disks on both my blu-ray and standard DVD players. On my blu-ray player, I either got a message saying, ""unreadable"" or instructing me to turn the disk over. When I did this, I got the same ""unreadable"" message. On my standard DVD player, I actually got ""House of Dracula"" to play, but it would continually hesitate and stop completely. Needless to say, I've contacted the seller and have sent it back.
  The Wolfman set contained the WRONG disks. Instead of the ""Wolfman Legacy Collection"" disks, I got the 2 disks from the ""Wolfman - Special Addition""! The disks seem to play ok (so far). I may keep this set (even with the wrong packaging), since it does, I believe, contain some special features not available in the Legacy set. It does not, of course, contain any of the other movies.
  The ""Frankenstein Legacy Collection"" has not yet arrived. Perhaps ""3 is a charm"" and this one will be a keeper. My advice to other buyers is this: You probably already know whether or not you like these movies (I'm sure there are some lucky collectors who are discovering them for the first time!). The Legacy Series is a great way to collect all the titles. If you want any of the Legacy Series badly enough, I suggest you bite the bullet and order a new copy directly from Amazon. There are just too many problems and complaints noted on these collections from other users to create much confidence in the reliability of used copies. The full price for new copies from Amazon is a little steep, but certainly worth it if you love these films as I do.",1314835200,4,1825,4.634674922600619
1989005,5,B0001CNRLG,"Viewers will enjoy this collection of films focusing on the Dracula legend. The Dracula book was written by Bram Stolker (1847-1912) in 1897 and received wide-spread heightened interest when Bela Lugosi played Dracula on the stage and then in a 1931 film. This collection contains the 1931 film and is accompanied by close to half a dozen discussions about the film, actors, settings, problems in making the movie, and other interesting matters. Lugosi was so good in the film that although many actors played Dracula after him, they and audiences generally had him in mind and made comparisons. This identification with Dracula made it difficult for Lugosi to find other roles. His wife and son buried him in one of the capes he used in the film.
The 1931 film was made when many theatres still lacked equipment to allow movie-goers to hear sound. Thus Universal, that produced the movie, made a second version that was identical to the first, but had language on the screen, as it appeared in silent films. Spanish-speaking people wanted their own version, so Universal made a second film using Spanish actors and directors. The English version was filmed during the day and the Spanish version at night, both in the same room using the same equipment. However, the Spanish-speaking people were able to see what the English-people had done during the day and felt they could do it better. They did so in many ways. However, the Spanish-speaking Dracula was not as superb as Lugosi.

Beside the Lugosi and Spanish versions and the commentaries, this collection also includes the 1936 film Dracula's Daughter, which could be considered a continuation of the 1931 films, and in which Van Helsing is charged with the murder of Dracula, the 1943 Son of Dracula with Lon Chaney, and the 1945 House of Dracula with John Carradine as Dracula and Lon Chaney as the Werewolf. All of the films are uncut. Readers of this review may be interested in reading my review of Bram Stoker's Dracula, a movie directed by Frances Ford Coppola.",1309824000,,2025,4.886627906976744
1989006,4,B0001CNRLG,"This legacy collection has it all One recognized classic Dracula, One formely lost film the spanish version of Dracula. One could be classic Daughter of Dracula, a B classic Son of Dracula. And to round out the set the House of Dracula a fun last gasp by most of the legacy monsters.
You can not go wrong at this price. If new to the horror genre, I recommend this set to start you out. Bela is both well loved and abused by his creation of Dracula on film. It shows him at his peak and despite critics is still hailed today for this protayal.
Other Draculas in this set are Lon Chaney jr. in Son of Dracula, this is a fun movie done very well on a tight script and budget. John Carradine does a superb if too subtle Dracula in House of Dracula. Both these movies are a Universal fans delight. The last 2 are Dracula the spanish version I enjoyed and thought that at times it was better than the Tod Browning version it is definitely worth a look. Last is Dracula's Daughter subtle lesbianism and a female predator make this film of interest for the film student. I find it too slow paced and drags at times. Other than that, I go through all these movies at least once a year, Also take in all of the extas they are great!",1307318400,,1223,4.230769230769231
1989007,3,B0001CNRLG,"Bela Lugosi is the quintessential Dracula. So it is hard for me to write this review. I found that the main movie ""Dracula"" just does not stand up to the test of time. I felt it was rather boring, although I loved Bela's performance. The other movies in this set are equally slow paced, although it was interesting to see Lon Chaney Junior as Dracula (or was he supposed to be his son?) in ""Son Of Dracula"".

To make matters worse NONE of the movies in this set have been digitally remastered, so even if you are huge fan of old timey monster movies, like me, you might be upset by the fading quality of these prints. Oddly enough, other than Dracula the prints are pretty good. It is with Dracula that I found the scratches, very dark, fading in and out images most annoying.

Still the price is good, and for nostalgia's sake, I gave this set a 3. I would really have preferred a remastered version of Dracula even though I found it boring. It deserves better treatment.",1306195200,,972,4.394444444444445
1989008,5,B0001CNRLG,"Dracula - The Legacy Collection was released on April 27, 2004 and contains five Universal Dracula movies: Dracula, Dracula - Spanish Version, Dracula's Daughter, Son of Dracula, and House of Dracula. In each movie a different actor portrays Dracula. In the origin Dracula - Bla Lugosi, Dracula - Spanish Version - Carlos Villaras, Dracula's Daughter - Gloria Holden, Son of Dracula - Lon Chaney, Jr., and House of Dracula - John Carradine. DVD extra The Road to Dracula ~ an original documentary gives the origin of the making of the Dracula making but the audio commentary does a better job. Frankenstein - The Legacy Collection does a better job at giving an in depth history of the Frankenstein movie then Dracula - The Legacy Collection. Still if you are a Universal monster horror fan like me then Dracula - The Legacy Collection is great to own and gets an AAA+++.

Dracula is one hour and fifteen minutes long and released in theaters on February 12, 1931. The plot of this movie is that Count Dracula is packing up his coffin and is leaving Transylvania for England and is leaving behind his three brides; why his brides are left behind is never explained in the movie. Dracula takes up residency at Carfax Abbey and begins to rob people of their blood. Professor Van Helsing finds out that Dracula is now living in London and is enjoying the nightlife. Professor Van Helsing heads to London and finds out that Dracula is after the beautiful Mina Seward. Dracula wants Mina to be his living dead bride. Professor Van Helsing and Jonathan Harker track Dracula and Mina to Carfax Abbey. Jonathan is able to rescue his beloved Mina and Van Helsing kills Dracula until he is rising again in the House of Frankenstein. This is Bla Lugosi finest roll. Bla Lugosi would play Dracula in two more films: Mark of the Vampire and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Dwight Frye plays an excellence believable Renfield; Dracula's slave. If nothing else some of the sex scenes, even though they are tame, are great. I am a big fan of the old Universal Studios monster horror films and this is one of the great ones from that era. If you can afford it, buy it.

Dracula - Spanish Version is one hour and forty-four minutes and was released in Cuban theaters in March 11, 1931; about a month earlier then the United States release. The English and Spanish version is very different but the plot is the same. Some of the major\minor differences are: the characters names are Hispanicize like Lucy Westenra becoming Lucia Weston and Count Dracula becomes Conde Dracula. The female wardrobe is more provocative, Renfield's death is more violent and in the English version Mina Seward is escorted down the steps and in the Spanish version Dracula carries Eva down the steps. One of the major differences is the Spanish version is twenty-nine minutes longer and does a better job in filling the gaps. From a technical standpoint the Spanish version is far better then the English version. Bla Lugosi portrayed a much scarier Dracula then his Spanish counterpart Carlos Villaras.

Dracula's Daughter is one hour and eleven minutes long and was release in theaters on May 11, 1936. This movie was the sequel to Dracula and picked up where Dracula left off. The movie almost never got made. James Whale (Frankenstein and the Invisible Man) grew tired of monster films and wanted to do Showboat, A. Edward Sutherland was then chosen to direct the film and he showed little interest in the movie. Finally Lambert Hillyer directed the film. Even Gloria Holden did not want the lead. She would was afraid she would forever be typecast like Bela Lugosi. As for plot, well there was one, just not a good one. The main plot of the story is Countess Marya Zaleska (Count Dracula's daughter) wants to lead a normal life and in doing so she burns daddy in a ritualistically ceremony and even goes as far in getting a psychiatrist to help her. Both attempts fail. As for the lesbian vampirism concerns, there are few scenes where Countess Marya Zaleska take a bite out of females victims and the film fades out before any necking is done. I give this movie a B- for the poor story. Only buy it if you want the sequel.

Son of Dracula is one hour and twenty minutes long and was release in theaters on November 5, 1943. This was the first Dracula movie to show transformation of bat to vampire and vampire to bat. This is a great movie to watch. Mainly for the special effects as I mention above though it is weak in one area. Since vampires don't cast a reflection then the special effects department did not have know how or did not have the budget to do so. Count Alucard and vampire Katherine can be seen casting their reflection throughout the movie. Even this ones die differently. Dracula dies with a stake through the heart, his daughter; an arrow through the heart and Junior's coffin is set on fire and he dies by daylight. I guess sun cancer can kill you after all. Also Dracula get married in this one; though we don't get to see it in the movie. With the exception of the title, it is not once revealed that Prince Alucard is Dracula's son. The location for Son of Dracula is set somewhere in the south. The reason for Prince Alucard coming to the United States is Transylvania is running low on fresh victims, where as the Unites States is a young country and full of blood donors. I would recommend this movie to anyone and Son of Dracula gets an AAAA++++.

House of Dracula is one hour and seven minute long and was released on December 7, 1945. This movie was the final farewell to Dracula, Wolf Man and the Monster; if one does not count Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein; also this was the shortest of the Dracula movie that were made. The movie is set several years in the future where House of Frankenstein ended. Dracula a. k. a. Baron Latos seemed to have escaped his sunlight death from the last movie and seeks a cure for his vampirism. Lawrence Talbot (the Wolf Man) seems immune from silver bullets because he was killed with one in the House of Frankenstein. So right there is a making for a poor script. The good Dr. Edelmann only goes evil when Baron Latos injects him with his blood. Creativity was not used in this movie. When Dr. Edelmann soul is debating between to bring the Monster back to life or destroy it, they are several flashbacks to several different Frankenstein movies. Even at the end, some of the film from the Ghost of Frankenstein was borrowed. If you must see this movie or even own, see if it can be down loaded.

1989010,3,B0001CNRLG,"The legacy collections (all of them) are by far the best, most perfect, wonderful, amazing thing a horror buff could ever ask for...and i really mean that! The extras on these disc's are great! The addition of all the extra movies just makes my horror-loving head explode!

But.............

For the most part i have had nothing but trouble with these disc's. Either they are loose and all scratched up, or they are held in so tight, you end up cracking the disc trying to get it out.

It is so frustrating to see these collections NOT re-released, in disc/customer friendly packaging. They have released other collections (like the 75th anniversary)....but none compare to the awesome magnitude of whats contained on the Legacy collections.

I would have to say if you really want these, then take the chance. You can always have the disc's buffed, but keep in mind that those buffers don't do to well with double sided disc's.....not to mention that can't fix cracks.",1299196800,,969,4.8545454545454545
1989011,2,B0001CNRLG,"Two stars only because of the loose disc issue.  Five stars otherwise.

This review is about the packaging/loose discs/subsequent viewing issues of the Legacy sets, and in particular, more for the Dracula Legacy Collection set, but I need to also mention the sets for Frankenstein and the Wolf Man, since I ordered all three at the same time, being fully aware of the issues people have had with loose discs upon arrival at their homes.  I recently received all three sets, so here's what I have experienced.

The Wolf Man set arrived first.  I was hesitant about the loose and scratched disc issue so many have complained about.  Neither disc was loose, and after viewing each movie and feature, everything was fine.  Whew!

A few days later, I received the sets for Frankenstein and Dracula.  As soon as I handled each set, I heard loose discs and thought I was in trouble.  I opened the Dracula set and found the second disc loose and badly scuffed and scratched.  I tried side one.  The movie started freezing and skipping at around 10 minutes.  At that point, further watching was impossible.  On side two, I got a message that the disc was not in the DVD format and thus was unplayable.  Very strange.  I have a very new Sony Blu-ray player with the Netflix feature, and have never had a problem with it until this disc.  I tried another player, but neither side would work.  Well, of course, this set is going to be returned.  I've seen two reviewers say that they, respectively have had to return 4 sets, 7 sets, and 5 sets between one or more of these Legacy Collections sets.  I'm on my first return with Dracula.  We'll have to see how the second set turns out.

My Frankenstein set came with a loose first disc.  It was not quite perfect in appearance, but it played through without a single problem.  The second disc was not loose, and was in perfect condition--no scratches or scuffs.  It, too, played through perfectly on both sides.  So I was lucky with the loose disc on this set.

With all three sets, I played through every movie and feature on my Sony Blu-ray player.

It's too bad that Universal's packaging is so deficient that it becomes a major comment on these Amazon pages.  To everyone who buys these Legacy sets, be aware of the chances you'll be taking.  If everything is fine, you'll enjoy what you receive.  If a disc is scratched, you very well may end up returning it.

As an aside commentary, I highly recommend the original 1999 DVD release of Dracula, which features the original 193l versions (English and Spanish), and the Philip Glass music version, and various features.  After comparing the two Draculas with Bela Lugosi, it is obvious that the 1999 audio track is superior.  It is noticeably cleaner and crisper as compared to the 2004 Legacy set, which is hashy and murkier.  Other reviewers have made the same comments.

As other reviewers have also mentioned, the 1999 version has the Renfield screams and the extended Dracula groans.  The 2004 version has no Renfield screams and only one Dracula groan.  The 1999 DVD is missing the short portion of symphony music at the end of the symphony hall scene, but the 2004 Legacy set has that music.  It's no big deal, though, as it's only a few seconds, and isn't required since all you're seeing at that point is Draculas' face, and the previous symphony music had already come to a conclusion long before the end of the scene.  By the time you see Dracula's face at scene's end, the orchestra has started playing again, as indicated in the 2004 Legacy set.  We just don't hear it on the 1999 release, and would never know the difference.  Seeing Dracula's face with silence at that point actually works out very well.  Just be aware of these differences.

The original 193l theater release audio is a censored version as represented in the 2004 Legacy set.  The 1999 DVD restores the audio the way it should have been heard in 193l.  This reminds me of how Frankenstein was censored:  the cut portion of the scene where he throws the little girl into the lake, causing her death.  I think it was cut after the original release, but I'm not sure on that.

After several years now after their original releases, don't expect Universal to improve their packaging on these Legacy sets.  Just be aware of the potential problems you may have.",1299024000,4,4329,4.631578947368421

I wonder if Universal Studios are repackaging the returned movies and sending them back out.

1989033,4,B0001CNRLG,"Though I grew up on these films, my kids have gone to the updated versions that are coming out with adolescent characters and amazing special effects.  Dracula seems clunky and old-fashioned to them, or ""weird"" as they label any (of my) culture that I bring to them in movie collections.  Still, I watched these with absolute delight and a sense of the childish wonder felt when I saw them in the 1960s.

There is nothing like Bela Lugosi's original version, which made him a b-movie star.  He has a sense of charismatic presence and dreadful purpose, with old-world charm.  To my mind, it is the best of all the dracs (and I have 4 other versions of the Stoker version).  The biggest surprise for me was the spanish version, which is almost as good as Lugosi's:  it was film on the same set at night!  It has a different feel and better character development in some ways.  Drac's daughter was also a welcome surprise, not a simple knockoff but a good story in its own right.  She is mysterious and beautiful, but also full of futile yearning to find a way back.  Very fun, and it continues van Helsing's story, once he was arrested for the murder of Drac.  Finally, there is the House of Drac, which is a terrible mishmash of characters, way to ambitious not just with wolfman and frankie, but also a pseudo-Jekyll/Hyde.  It is pretty dumb, but fun nonetheless.

Recommended for all film buffs, esp, the nostalgic ones like me.  Note:  I got this new in region 2, for $8.",1294099200,,1473,4.5227272727272725

1989036,2,B0001CNRLG,"I recently purchased a large selection of monster movie multi-sets, inspite of the several warnings I read regarding double-sided discs from Universal. I'm here to tell you, those warnings are valid. So far, only the ""Frankenstein"" set played flawlessly. As for the other sets, the sigle side discs in the sets play fine, but the double sided discs gave me problems. With both the ""Dracula"" set and ""The Wolf Man"" set, Side 1 of Disc 2 will not play at all on my Sony Blue-ray player. I got a replacement for ""The Wolf Man"" set from Amazon (very expedient, I might add), but I have the same problem. Also, I purchased an 8-pack of Hammer horror films, also distributed by Universal, consisting of 2 double-sided discs. These will play, but there were several skips and freezes throughout. Once again, Amazon replaced that set. Fortunately so far, the replacement plays with no problems. I have yet to watch ""The Invisible Man"" collection because I'm too frustrate with the others. I'm sure Universal and Amazon have received many complaints regarding these defective double-sided discs. Apparently Universal refuses to do anything about it.

1989065,5,B0001CNRLG,"Lot of reviews here and everyone knows the story, so I'll comment on some things from a different angle. You have the option of watching Dracula with an optional soundtrack by Philip Glass performed by the Kronos Quartet. Having studied Philip Glass while majoring in music composition at a music conservatory, I am familiar with many of his works, and was curious to see if his style of composition would work with this movie. I'm sad to say it does not. Glass is known for repetition and variation of motifs. I first thought it might just work with the film because his music, with all of it's repetitive eighth notes might coincide with the hypnotic state cast by Dracula over his subjects. But there are only certain scenes when Dracula actually performs his hypnotic casting, but Glass' driving eighth notes repeating over and over with very little relief just amounts to driving you mad -- I could only take about 20 minutes of it and had to switch back the original sound track. It's not just Glass' style, it just doesn't sound like it was composed to ""add"" emotional depth to the scenes; instead, it is in the foreground and is almost constantly playing and comes across like a contemporary musical composition being showcased with the movie Dracula projected in the background. To make matters worse, it is very loud compared to the actor's speech, so there are some quite scenes where you actually miss what the character is saying because the string quartet drowns them out.

Here's the sad part:  for this optional soundtrack, Universal cleaned up the noisy background hiss of the original and processed it in Digital Dolby, but did nothing to clean up the original soundtrack -- how lame is that? Well, I'm willing to listen to the noisy background of the original just to be rid of a very unsuccessful ""soundtrack"" that draws attention to itself and actually detracts from the movie instead of enhancing it. Isn't it a mystery how Hollywood operates? You just gotta wonder sometimes. I understand there are costs and profits at stake for everything you do, but wouldn't you think for a classic like this they would run the film through one of the many computerized digital correction facilities that are available these days to correct, cleanup, and enhance both the visual and audio aspects of these old, historic films? Instead, they blow the money to have someone compose a contemporary soundtrack!?! Crazy, isn't it?

This review is already too long, but let me just mention that I had been curious for awhile to see the Spanish production that I've heard so much about as being superior. Personally, I did not think it was superior. The actor that plays Dracula has big ears and always seems to have some sort of goofy smile - I found nothing sinister, suave, or hypnotic about him. Nor did I find the lighting or camera angles more dramatic. The actor who plays Renfield, while found in the cargo section of the boat is just laughing like he heard a really funny joke, nothing scary there or implication that he's insane, whereas, Dwight Frye's acting in the same scene (in the American production), when the police open the hatch and look down into the cargo area, there's Renfield staring up at them with eyes wide open in a trance and he's letting out a frighting half groan, half laugh as only someone who is deeply demented and raving mad would do. What I did find interesting about the Spanish version was that it contained more dialogue and explained some scenes in greater detail. I think part of the mystique that makes the American version so eerie is it's silence and minimal dialogue. Remember, it's director, Tod Browning had just come from directing silent pictures where visually the set and actors had to convey what would be normally be revealed through dialogue. And it's this ""non-wordiness"" that is very effective in adding mystique and suspense that culminates in a film that penetrates a deeper and lingering horror that is so much more successful than the graphic slice-n-dice, blood, gut and gore movies that comprise the horror movies of today.",1254960000,3,4090,4.8150782361308675

1989069,4,B0001CNRLG,"""Son of Dracula"" succeeds on many counts, (no pun intended) by virtue of its absolutely serious approach towards its material. Unlike other Universal horrors of this period, with their unfunny comedy relief antics, (bumbling, pop eyed police inspectors, burgomasters etc.) director Siodmak wisely eschews such sch-tick, and foreshadows the tragic ending of the story, with an increasingly oppressive sense of doom. In other words, unity of mood.

Indeed every aspect of the production is put at the service of conveying this doom, from George Robinson's highly expressionistic, shadowy photography to Vera West's (Hollywood's most under-appreciated designer) costume design.

The casting is excellent. It has been rightly observed that Lon Chaney Jr. is not an entirely comfortable choice for the Count, and it is certainly true that his Midwestern dialect and general deportment is not even remotely aristocratic. Still, his virility breathes menace, and in a scene where he traps a character in a basement, he evokes genuine dread. All told, he passes muster, and even more so, when you think of what a hokey disaster someone like John Carradine would have been in the part.

Robert Paige is superb--his increasingly manic desperation in the role of the suitor ""Frank"" goes a long way in lending the yarn credibility. In many ways it's his film. Evelyn Ankers is as always, very easy on the eyes, and though she is given little to do here, she does it fetchingly.

Which brings us the the protagonist, Kay Caldwell, (Louise Allbritton) the melancholic daughter of an aristocratic line, and the proprietress of its creepy plantation mansion--""Dark Oaks."" This is a juicy assignment, and Miss Allbritton runs with it to the full.

From the moment she arrives on the veranda, a striking brunette clad in a billowing, peignoir like gown, she delineates her literally spell-bound character by offering the audience a spell bindingly detached characterization.

Who can resist her otherworldly gaze, as, staring outside of the frame, she smoothly articulates her certainty in telepathy, eerily chiding Miss Ankers for scoffing at ESP, and later her asperity at local gossip: ""What can they know of these occult matters?-blind fools!"" Visually, she is unforgettable, aided by Vera West's outr costumes, (even Miss Allbritton's day wear is mysterious--as witness her scalloped black waistband peplum ensemble with black under-dress, in the will reading sequence) and a black wig, which connects her with another black wigged anti-heroine from that same year--Jean Brooks in Lewton's ""The Seventh Victim.""

To abet these characterizations, and to conceal what seems to be a somewhat paltry budgetary outlay by Universal, director Sidiomak fills the screen with interesting visuals--Miss Allbritton's unforgettable trek through the nocturnal bayou to visit the gypsy, the gypsy's ensuing death in a bat attack, Chaney gliding across the misty swamp, and unsettling, shadowy close-ups of an unhinged Mr. Paige speaking through the bars of a prison.

Photographer Robinson is with him all the way, and composes and lights his shots to consistently interesting effect, (note the superb introduction to ""Dark Oaks,"" with the camera panning through a creaking gate at night, whilst the whole frame is overlaid with the violent twist of brambles and vines) by foregrounding his shots with interesting objects on right or left--thereby lending depth and texture to his visual tableaux.

The ending with Mr. Paige finding his former love, Miss Allbritton, literally buried within the childhood detritus of her own attic, to which, after placing his ring on her finger, he sets afire, provides a fitting finale. A finale of marked and deeply felt tragedy, as a darkly romantic musical score swells, the camera treks in on Mr. Paige's blank, despairing gaze, his empty eyes lit by the shadows of the flames.

""Son of Dracula"" is a deeply romantic dark dream of a film. Recommended.",1233964800,2,3963,5.30622009569378

1989093,4,B0001CNRLG,"This wonderful collection gathers together five of Universal's classic horror films. This particular set focuses on Dracula. The films in this 2-disc set are:

Dracula - 1931
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bla-Lugosi/dp/B0009X770E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bla Lugosi</a>&nbsp;is immortalized as Count Dracula in Tod Browning's classic horror film, which is considered by many to be the first sound horror film (Universal had had success with horror films during the silent age as well).
Starring Bla Lugosi, Dwight Frye, Edward Van Sloan, Helen Chandler and David Manners.

Dracula (Spanish Version) - 1931
Director George Melford's Spanish-language version of Dracula is a technical triumph but it lacks a talented cast with the exception of the sultry Lupita Tovar.
Starring Carlos Villarias, Lupita Tovar, Pablo Alvarez Rubio and Barry Norton.

Dracula's Daughter - 1936
The first sequel to Dracula is an erotically charged (by the standards of the time it was made) suspense tale about the Countess Marya Zaleska, Dracula's daughter, who seeks to end her vampirism with the help of a psychiatrist.
Starring Edward Van Sloan, Otto Kruger, Gloria Holden and Marguerite Churchill.

Son of Dracula - 1943
Dracula's son, Count Alucard (Alucard is Dracula spelled backwards) falls in love with a young woman in the bayous of the south but her fiance uncovers his scheme and vows to save her from Alucard's clutches.
Starring Lon Chaney, Jr., Louise Albritton, Robert Paige, Evelyn Ankers and Frank Craven.

House of Dracula - 1945
Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster all come together in a mad romp of monstrous mayhem when The Wolf Man and Dracula seek out a doctor to cure them of their blood thirst.
Starring John Carradine, Lon Chaney, Jr., Glenn Strange, Martha O'Driscoll, Lionel Atwill, Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Ludwig Stossel.

Disc One includes the original Dracula film along with numerous bonus materials. Some of those materials are: The Road to Dracula documentary, poster montage, theatrical trailer, an interview with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing/dp/B0018CWESK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing</a>&nbsp;director Stephen Sommers, audio commentary with David J. Skal and an optional score by composer Philip Glass.
Disc Two: Side One includes the 1931 Spanish Version of Dracula with an introduction by star Lupita Tovar Kohner. Also includes the 1936 sequel Dracula's Daughter. There are two theatrical trailers as bonus material.
Disc Two: Side Two includes the 1943 film, Son of Dracula and the 1945 film, House of Dracula.

All of these films are classics in their own way and I highly recommend this set to fans of classic horror films. However I must warn people that the audio and picture quality varies from film to film. Unfortunately Universal does not have the original negative prints of many of these films, which makes restoring them properly almost impossible. But with the five films that are showcased in this 2-disc Legacy Collection and numerous special features, this DVD is still a worthy addition to any film fan's library.

1989094,5,B0001CNRLG,"It's easy to view Universal's Legacy Collection series as nothing more than an effort to repackage an old product by adding on lousy sequels that no one would want to buy anyway.  I'm very pleased to say that this is absolutely not the case with the Dracula Legacy collection.  There's a tremendous amount of wealth contained within this little two disc volume.

To begin with, I'm very impressed with audio options available in this release of the 1931 Dracula film.  There's always going to be a rift when you tamper with a classic.  That's why I think this Legacy Collection offers us such a rare opportunity, being able to watch the film with its original soundtrack or the new Philip Glass soundtrack, depending upon our preference.  I was initially reluctant to watch with the new soundtrack, believing that classics should generally be left untouched.  It was only after more than thirty minutes of viewing, when things were feeling thoroughly tedious, that I changed the soundtrack in utter desperation.  What happened next utterly amazed me.

Suddenly, everything clicked and flowed beautifully.  I began to discover that, all along, the film had possessed strong acting, rich, expressive shots and lighting, and a compelling story.  All it had been missing was momentum.  This 1931 film feels very uncomfortable with the concept of sound and, as a result, uses it poorly.  Long spaces of silence and little action cause high points to feel jarred and unrelated.  More than that, the film simply begins to feel boring.  But Glass's soundtrack fixes all of this, bringing out the richness of tone, leveling out seemingly over the top and restrained acting alike, and adding a true sense of momentum and direction to scenes and cuts that formerly felt amorphous and, perhaps, arbitrary.  Loyal fans of the film may argue that it was good enough for them to begin with.  But, for someone like me, even with a strong affinity for silent and early talking films, ""Dracula"" shifted from utterly inaccessible to frightfully compelling with the push of a button.

When it comes to the two direct sequels in this volume, It's true that neither are on the level of ""Bride of Frankenstein,"", but they aren't as awful as they might sound. Sure, Universal was a factory back in the day, pumping out sequels without any real concern for the content. Still, there's some very good stuff to be found here.

""DRACULA'S DAUGHTER"" is, in my opinion, the weaker of the two Dracula sequels. Perhaps it's just too much of a departure from the original premise, featuring an almost likable vampire who enlists the aid of a psychiatrist to cure her of her blood addiction. There's little development in plot or character, no honest progression from point A to point B. Still, the acting and directing are both adequate, and Marguerite Churchill (Janet) really steals the show as the goofy, vivacious love interest who speaks her mind and cuts her over-serious boss down to size whenever she gets the chance. Add to that a truly unusual premise (even when it fails to deliver much), and some incredibly sexually charged subtext, particularly when the Countess abducts a young woman under the false pretense of having the girl ""model"" for her. This is one odd-ball film, full of concepts, sexual issues, and gender politics that were way ahead of its time. Not a great film in and of itself, but it certainly deserves a viewing.

""SON OF DRACULA"" is a much stronger film in contrast. It comes dangerously close to being an incredibly impressive film, with stunning special effects (we actually SEE Dracula transform into a bat, as well as turn into vapor), an incredibly complex, emotionally charged plot, and some breath-taking acting (particularly from Robert Paige and Louise Allbritton). Unfortunately, there are two things that prevent the film from achieving greatness. The first is most certainly Lon Chaney Jr., assuming the role of Lord Alucard (Dracula backwards). Chaney never seems comfortable in the cloak, portraying a weirdness that is too subtle and unfocused for the role he is attempting to undertake. He's never an impressive character, neither as monster nor villain.

Perhaps the bigger problem with Son of Dracula is the camera work. Director Robert Siodmak is clearly a master of the technical aspects of directing. Movement and camera angles are almost always highly impressive, as well as smooth and unimposing upon the film. However, in a picture that contains such strong elements of passion, desperation, fear, insanity, and (of course) the supernatural, the camera always resists these forces, maintaining a stubbornly grounded and literal perception of the scene. The film always feels too realistic, unwilling to surrender to escapism, never daring to achieve something artistic and powerful. This is particularly disappointing in the final scene, which could have easily been immortalized as the greatest, most moving moment in Universal Monster Movie history had it been shot differently.

Enough has already been said in these reviews about ""THE SPANISH VERSION OF DRACULA"" and the final film in this volume, ""HOUSE OF DRACULA"".  Silly as the latter may be, this is the only way for Universal Monster completists to obtain it on DVD.

All in all, This is one fantastic collection.  The Phillip Glass scored Dracula is an absolute must see, even if you ultimately decide that it isn't to your taste.  Dracula's Daughter and Son of Dracula are both worthwhile sequels that hold their own merit. While I would probably never watch Dracula's Daughter a second time, the first time viewing experience was certainly worthwhile. In contrast, I expect to return to Son of Dracula again and again. It's almost a brilliant film, and ""almost brilliant"" is still good enough for me.  Then, of course, there's the stylistic Spanish version of Dracula, as well as the House of Dracula film, which isn't available on DVD anywhere else.  You really can't lose with a collection like this one.  The price is right, and the films are absolutely worth it.",1216080000,5,6053,5.031031031031031
1989095,4,B0001CNRLG,"Dracula - The Legacy Collection brings you some of the best of Universal's vampire films.
As with the other sets in this series, Universal took the cheap way and used a double-sided disk for the second disk.
On to the films...
Dracula - the classic iconic representation of the vampire. Bela is great in this somewhat stagey yet effective production. Unfortunately the print used was scratchy and the digital transfer was very poor. It's odd that of all the films on this set only the original was in such poor condition. I found the ""extra"" Philip Glass score intrusive and overdone, destroying the eerie atmosphere of the film.
Dracula (1931 Spanish Version) - Interesting as a curiosity and in some ways technically superior to the Lugosi version. Thank heaven for the optional subtitles. Good print and a good digital transfer.
Dracula's Daughter - Seldom seen but enjoyable film. Gloria Holden gives a good performance as the tortured daughter of the Count. Irving Pichel stands out as her very creepy manservant. An interesting tale with just the slightest undertone of lesbianism. Good print and good transfer on this entry.
Son of Dracula - Goofy but fun film featuring Lon Chaney Jr. as Count Alucard. Poor performances by all concerned and a ludicrous plot make this film enjoyable for its camp value. Good print and good transfer on this entry.
House of Dracula - John Carradine is the immortal Count in this one and he meets up with the Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster, a hunchback and a mad scientist. Lots of milling around and silliness. Again, a good print and digital transfer.
Bonus Extras - One promoting the then-current ""Van Helsing"" (not so good) and another about Bela and Dracula (pretty good).",1208217600,2,1718,4.948096885813149
1989096,2,B0001CNRLG,"The first disk includes the movie, which is actually pretty bad because the director wasn't accustomed to ""talkies"" and so made the move with minimal sound, not even background music in most scenes.  The quality of the film is unrefurbished, so it's scratchy and old.  The extras include a score by Philip Glass, but there was no need to rewrite the opening credits music.  The original ""theme"" to Dracula was so far superior to the Philip Glass opening theme, so I didn't continue watching the film again with the new score.  The other extras are great, especially ""The Road to Dracula"" that is introduced and narrated by producer Carl Lemmle's daughter.  She is delightful and it's an interesting documentary. I give this set only two stars, however, because I could not watch ""Son of Dracula"" or ""House of Dracula"" because there is nothing on the second side of the second disk.  Very frustrating and inexcusable.  You may wish to trouble yourself with replacing a defective disk, but another reviewer here wrote that the replacement disk was also defective.  So instead of getting infuriated, save yourself the trouble and skip this set until they issue a ""recall"" and ensure that these defects do not occur.",1194134400,4,1212,4.9068627450980395

1989123,4,B0001CNRLG,"Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but perhaps the best adaptation is the classic Bela Lugosi version. And ""Dracula - The Legacy Collection"" collects not only Lugosi's movie and the Spanish version, but three inferior sequels that are still moderately entertaining -- basically a vampire-lover's delight.

A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a mad Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.

Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London.

Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. It's incredibly good, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and amazing acting.

And there's an immediate sequel, ""Daughter of Dracula,"" about a beautiful Transylvanian vampire -- created by Dracula -- who comes to England seeking a way out of her eternal torment, now that her ""father"" has been permanently killed. But her sinister servant wants to keep her enslaved to her bloodlust.

Then there are two inferior sequels: ""Son of Dracula,"" which is basically a whittled-down plot set in the early twentieth century, with an exceptionally wooden ""Count Alucard"" played by Lon Chaney Jr. He moves in next to an heiress's house, kills her father, and marries her, so it's up to her ex-boyfriend to save the day.

And finally there's ""House of Dracula,"" in which the very popular Dr. Edelmen (Onslow Stevens) gets two requests for supernatural cures from some kind of miraculous mold: Count Dracula (John Carradine), and the wolfman Lawrence Talbot (Lon Cheney Jr). Talbot is suicidal over his transformations, and Dracula is secretly pursuing Edelman's vacuous nurse and driving the good doc insane. And they stumble across Frankenstein's monster too.

It's a mixed bag, vampirewise. The first two are among the best classic horror ever made, but the sequels deteriorate as they proceed -- ""Daughter"" is a very solid movie on its own, and ""Son"" is cliche and wooden. By ""House,"" they've decided to just be silly and campy, and throw in as many fictional monsters as they can fit in.

The direction in the first three movies is quite solid, eerie and gothic, with plenty of memorably haunting moments (""I never drink... wine,"" Dracula says smilingly). Lots of cobwebbed castles, foggy London streets, bats and women drifting around in white dresses. The last two are strictly B-movie fare in terms of directorial skill, and some moments like the flaming mine are simply awful.

Lugosi is simply brilliant as Dracula. While not the stately, imposing figure that Stoker described, he has a blazing intensity that works just as well, as well as great charm. Carlos Villaras is not quite as good, but does an excellent and faithful job in the Spanish version. Carradine doesn't seem to be trying too hard, and Cheney just doesn't work as a vampire (though he's glorious as Talbot).

These actors are backed by casts that range from the sublime (creepy, bug-eating, cackling Frye) to the ridiculous (the dreamy-eyed, hammy nurses in ""House""). Gloria Holden deserves special kudos for her tormented, bisexual vampiress torn between good and evil, and Edward Van Sloan as Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing.

""Dracula - The Legacy Collection"" has a dud and a campy monsterfest, but the first three movies are divinely dark horror/suspense movies. Definitely worth getting and enjoying.",1172534400,3,4053,5.125757575757576

Dracula's not my favorite movie from Universal's golden era, but I've seen it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many more before I buy the farm.  Lugosi managed to create THE Dracula.  They even discuss this in the documentary on the disc, but even folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image of Lugosi's Dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of Dracula up.  Even with all the different actors who've played the role over the years(some turning in wonderful performances, some not so wonderful), they all seem to be in Lugosi's shadow somehow coz he just WAS Dracula.  Lugosi gave a voice to Dracula.  Ever do a Dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one?  What voice did you(or they) use? Lugosi's of course.  However, I don't think I'd like this film half as much if it hadn't had been for Dwight Frye as Renfield.  Frye is rather unappreciated and never became well known outside the horror circle.  He is to the character of Renfield what Lugosi is to Dracula.  Sorry, Tom Waits just didn't cut the mustard for me.  This film is many years old and probably wouldn't be considered frightening by a five year old kid.  In fact, it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with Lugosi's exaggerated stares, hand movements and dialogue.  Not to mention Frye's overacting as well.  But the fact of the matter is, this movie scared the pants off people in it's time.  When was the last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened them?  Who knows, and it's not likely to happen again in our rather desensitized society.  In fact, I doubt most modern moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75 minute film.  Anyhow, you owe it to Bela, Dwight and yourself to check it out.  As for the other films in the set, it's kinda hit and miss, but none of them are bad by any means.  Apparently somewhere along the lines, Dracula fathered two kids(!) coz we have Dracula's Daughter and Son Of Dracula.  Neither movie is all that bad.  Dracula's Daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of the vampire curse.  Dracula's son on the other hand seems to enjoy the vampire lifestyle.  Chaney makes a decent enough vampire, but this son didn't inherit his father's suaveness and charisma.  The spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more atmospheric than the american version.  House Of Dracula's kind of the odd one out as it's really a sequel to House Of Frankenstein, which itself is a sequel to Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.  House of Dracula is best viewed as a double feature with House Of Frankenstein.  Like the Frankenstein and Wolf Man sets, this one has an interesting documentary tracing Dracula from Bram Stoker's novel right up to the Frank Langella film version.  Also sliming his way into this set is Stephen Sommers flapping his gums again about how Dracula influenced his piece of crap Van Helsing movie.  Don't ask me why I watched this feature, maybe I was looking for a reason to get pissed.  Anyhow, with a price tag like this and five Universal classics, it certainly sold me.",1167609600,3,3588,4.586477987421383

1989153,5,B0001CNRLG,"this collection of the dracula movies from universal is a great transfer of these great old movies. the pictures are clear and the sound is crisp and clear.

  while i love the dracula movies i think that just as universal's frankenstein movies were better than the dracula movies, hammer's dracula's were better than their frankenstein's.

  the original dracula with bela lugosi is a little dated now and doesn't hold up as well as when it first came out. it looks like just what it was a stage play brought to the screen. everything happens off screen and the spend a lot of time talking about the action. on the plus side lugosi(though it is a one note proformance) is very creepy as the count and his entrance is the stuff of movie legend. there are twoversions here of lugosi's here the origanl and the one with the new score written for it. i like the new score,but i still prefer the origanl without it. part of the creepyness of the movie is the long passages of no music.

  the spanish version is a real treat. filmed at the same time,but shot at night on the same stages as the lugosi one this is really the better movie and it is great to see it and compair the two.

  dracula's daughter is a very good film that flirts with the pre-code of hollywood by have dracula's girl find women her favorite victims. some strong stuff for the day.

  son of dracula puts lon chaney jr. in the cape and helped make him the only person to play every monster in the bunch. this is a fondly loved movie of mine and it looks good. the victim in this one wants to be bitten so she can live forever,a nice change of pace.

  house is the last of the monster cycle and one that has all the monsters in it. it's great fun.

  so sit back and grab your cross and watch",1145577600,4,1762,4.278787878787878
1989154,3,B0001CNRLG,"""Dracula - The Legacy Collection"" is a 2 DVD set which includes five Dracula films from Universal's earlier years.  The first DVD is a single sided disc which contains the original 1931 film staring Bela Lugosi as well as several features, a theatrical trailer for the original movie, photos, and an audio commentary with the film historian David J. Skal.  The second DVD is a two-sided disc which contains the other four films and trailers for two of the films.  I found the second DVD to be problematic in some DVD players, especially on the Spanish version and ""Son of Dracula"".

""Dracula"" staring Bela Lugosi is the key film in this collection.  Lugosi's Dracula became the model which most of the film adaptations since have used.  Being made during a period where sound in films was new, results in a very quiet movie, which in some places adds to its eeriness.  The direction, by Tod Browning, is fairly bland, and there are some truly odd moments, such as the shot of armadillos in Dracula's castle in Transylvania.  Nevertheless, this is a key film from an historical standpoint, and it should not be missed, and its premier on February 12th, 1931 in New York City marked the arrival of the Universal Horror movies.

""Dracula"" (a.k.a. Spanish Dracula in the U.S.) was filmed at the same time as the Bela Lugosi movie.  Sound was new in movies, and the studio thought that people would respond better to a movie shot in their own language as opposed to the use of dubbing.  This movie used the same sets as the other movie, filming at night where the other cast filmed during the day.  They also used some long shots cut from the English version, because their budget was significantly smaller.  This movie was made for about $66,000 where the English version cost $355,000.  The direction by George Melford is superior to that of Tod Browning, and in many ways this is the superior version of the movie.  This movie premiered on March 20th, 1931 in Madrid.

""Dracula's Daughter"" (a.k.a. Daughter of Dracula) picks up at almost the exact moment where the first movie ends.  The police arrest Van Helsing (played in both movies by Edward Van Sloan) for killing Dracula.  Countess Marya Zeleska (Gloria Holden), who is Dracula's Daughter, steals Dracula's body and destroys it, hoping that she will be free from the curse.  When it does not work, she decides she wants Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger) to return with her to Transylvania.  When he refuses, she kidnaps Janet Blake (Marguerite Churchill) and returns to Transylvania knowing that Dr. Garth will follow and try to rescue her.  This film is supposedly based on a Bram Stoker short story titled ""Dracula's Guest"".  I don't know if that is true, but the chase back to Transylvania is reminiscent of the end of the novel ""Dracula"".  The logic of the plot of this movie was rather poor, as the viewer can only wonder as to why the Countess didn't simply hypnotize Dr. Garth the way she did so many others, and then compel him to return with her.  This movie was released on May 11th, 1936.

""Son of Dracula"" features Lon Chaney Jr., as Count Alucard (Dracula backwards) who comes to the United States feeling that it has new blood which will help energize him.  The plot has a few twists in it, and the viewer learns through events about things which must have taken place before the events in the movie.  The traditional roles are filled here with Katherine `Kay' Caldwell (Louise Allbritton) being Dracula's interest, Frank Stanley (Robert Paige) as Kay's boyfriend, Professor Harry Brewster (Frank Craven) the traditional man of science, and Professor Laszlo (J. Edward Bromberg) being the Van Helsing type.  This film premiered on November 5th, 1943.

""House of Dracula"" (a.k.a. The Wolf Man's Cure) is the most bizarre film of this collection.  It opens with Dracula (John Carradine), apparently no longer destroyed, visiting Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), apparently interested in a cure for his curse.  Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), who is the Wolf Man, shows up the next night, also in search of a cure.  Events result in the discovery of Frankenstein's Monster (Glenn Strange), and later in a Jekyll and Hyde situation.  Throw in the beautiful hunchback Nina (Jane Adams), and Miliza Morrelle (Martha O'Driscoll) who is the love interest for both Dracula and the Wolf Man, and don't forget some angry villagers, and you have a very strange mix.  This was the sequel to ""House of Frankenstein"" (a.k.a. Dracula's Doom) which came out the year before.  For some reason, this movie was nominated for a retro Hugo for Dramatic Presentation for the year 1945.  This is a fun movie to watch, but hardly a great film.  It premiered on December 7th, 1945.

This is a good collection of movies for those who like the early Universal films, but I do wonder about the overall quality of the DVDs, because of the problems I had with the dual-sided second DVD.  I thought it was also rather sparse in terms of documentation for the films themselves.  There is no booklet, just a single sheet which has a very short description of the movies and is really more of an advertisement for the other sets in the collection and the Van Helsing movie.  The movies themselves vary quite a bit in terms of picture quality and sound.  I would say it is a good collection, but they could have done much more with it.",1140912000,19,5365,4.7556756756756755

1989156,3,B0001CNRLG,"Note: In this review I will only discuss the original 'Dracula'

Sorry friends, but 'Dracula' is little more than a curiosity nowadays.  I watched this for the first time since I was a little kid, and it has not aged well.  Course, you can't trust your judgement from when your 5-7.  Put just about anything in front of me, and I was hypnotized.  Of course, that's largely true today, which is why this manages a full 3 stars.

The technical problems aren't even at the heart of this films flaws.  Hell, 'Night of the Living Dead' is the greatest horror movie of all time, but it isn't much more advanced than this from a technical standpoint.  And it's not a lack of visceral violence, as I still really enjoy 'Carnival of Souls' and 'Night of the Demon', which are no more graphic than this.  The real problem is that they apparently didn't even understand how to tell stories thru sound films yet at this point.  Perhaps they supposed that the fact that the film had people actually talking in it would be sufficient enticement and novelty to interest people, and wouldn't doubt that it would've been at the time.  Thus, they've cut back on the visual panache of expressionist horror films with out adding in adequate plot so we get the worst of both worlds. (And something noticeably less interesting than say 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari', though that film isn't exactly the height of fascination either.)

It's obvious that this is just basically a filming of a play.  Much more troubling, it's fairly lousy play, with rather dull, flavorless and perfunctory dialogue.  It does have some nice set design and some okay atmosphere at the beginning, but it drags in the second half, a truly disconcerting thing for a film that's not much over an hour long. Still, it is worth something, simply as a curiosity.  It's just somewhat interesting to watch such a primitive movie, just to get a sense of history and a taste of something different, but the dated aspects of the film don't have too much novelty. (Unlike, say, 'King Kong', which is threadbare when it comes to plot and dialogue, but has fascinating and intriguing effects.) Really, this is like the cave paintings in Europe when it comes to film.  Worth seeing once, but not much worth analyzing.  Not much to analyze, as a matter of fact.  And yeah, you can barely hear anything on this DVD.

1989159,3,B0001CNRLG,"OK, my kids saw Van Helsing (dumb movie) at a sleepover last weekend and got into the whole Dracula thing so I sat down and did my research.  In the last week I watched all the greats again, Murneau's Nosferatu and then Herzog's version.  Today I watched Browning's and Coppola's Dracula and I watched Morrisey's last week (yuk!).  I must say the German versions are far scarier and more realistic.  Max Von Shrek is truly repulsive while Lugosi seems stiff and almost comical at times.  Klaus Kinski nails the role while Oldman (maybe it was Coppola's fault) is more like ""Count Liberace"".  As far as supporting roles go, if you look at the actors playing Lucy, Renfield and Harker there is no comparison, Murneau and Herzog have stronger casting.  I probably shouldn't have watched the films in this order because I used to love the original Dracula and I dig Tod Browning and ""Freaks"" and all (check out Herzog's ode to Browning entitled ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"") but from the script to lighting to props (i.e., the bats in Browning's Dracula suck and Coppola's are overblown), the ""Nosferatu's"" are superior.  I'm gonna have to see every flick about ""Drac"" ever made in the next few months (can't wait for the 70's trash pics) to give a fair comparison but for now, this is my two cents.  As far as this DVD set and the rest of the films it features are concerned, I think the ""Monster Collection"" sets are still cool and the films may range from sorta scary to downright silly, but they're neat additions to the collection.",1128988800,3,1531,4.661710037174721
1989160,4,B0001CNRLG,"It is Halloween season again, my favorite time of year because I get to watch dozens of true classic horror films by bug light with ceiling garlands and a full-sized skeleton hanging against my bedroom wall.  Along with the Frankenstein Monster, Dracula has become the key movie icon for Halloween.  I like him more.

I believe we have filmmaker Stephen Sommers to thank for the lovely and atmospheric DRACULA: THE LEGACY COLLECTION.  Universal Studios Home Video released authorized studio prints of five Dracula classics on DVD as a tie-in to Sommers' VAN HELSING (2004).  We get two versions of Lugosi's 1931 classic:  without music score and with the Kronos Quartet score; the 1931 Spanish language DRACULA (introduced by its still-beautiful leading lady Lupita Tovar), DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936), SON OF DRACULA (1943), and HOUSE OF DRACULA (1945).  We also get Sommers chatting about how his new movie fits in here; an original documentary called THE ROAD TO DRACULA; film historian David J. Skal doing audio commentary on the Lugosi original; remastered audio; posters and other publicity material for Lugosi; and original theatrical trailers for all of the movies.

Lugosi's DRACULA is a true film classic, but people forgot how very slow-moving it is with no music score, so the Kronos Quartet soundtrack helps a lot for at least me.  The movie has a tremendously moody first reel in Transylvania, but most of the early talkie shows its stage play origins when we move back to London.  Try playing it with both Kronos Quartet and the Skal audio commentary, which is very insightful.

The Spanish-language DRACULA was shot at night on the same sets and with the same script, but a different cast and director.  I actually like it much more.  Carlos Villar is a scary and elegant Dracula for me, and Lupita Tovar a lovely leading lady.  And director George Melford and his cinematographer give it pace and rich mood.  Watch both versions and decide which you like more.

I have a great fondness for DRACULA'S DAUGHTER, made by Universal five years later but picking up where the 1931 film ends-with Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) standing over Dracula's coffin.  He is arrested by Scotland Yard for the vampire murder!  There are only two justice choices-death by hanging if it was premeditated or going to an insane asylum.  Van Helsing's lawyer is Otto Kruger, whose screwball secretary Marguerite Churchill provides the film's laughs.  Providing the chills are Gloria Holden as the title character, who adds some definitely intended lesbian overtones when she bites the neck of a prostitute about to jump into the Thames one night.  Kruger and his secretary are her next victims!  This creative ""B"" movie has a lot going on in only 70 minutes.

Leonard Maltin loves SON OF DRACULA also, giving it also a *** and calling it ""One of Universal's most atmospheric chillers, with crisp acting, fine effects...and an unexpected finale.""  The setting this time is the American Deep South, the cast is headed by Lon Chaney Jr, and the director is noir specialist Robert Siodmak.

We refer to Maltin's indispensible video guide again for HOUSE OF DRACULA, which I saw last year and is a sequel to HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Onslow Stevens and Lon Chaney, Jr. star in an overly ambitious 67 minute programmer.  John Carradine, Lionel Atwill, and Glenn Strange all appear in this one.

For Halloween season, you could do far worse than the atmospheric and exhaustive DRACULA: THE LEGACY COLLECTION, on DVD and selling in the inexpensive $20 range.  You are getting quite a lot for your money and could not rent the movies for that price.  And we really should all rent VAN HELSING to thank Stephen Sommers for freeing the classics from the Universal vaults.  Thank you, Universal Studios!",1128124800,5,3783,4.966613672496026
1989161,5,B0001CNRLG,"Universal Studios has provided a real treat for fans of the old B horror movies.  This collection will give you hours of entertainment pleasure.  Bela Lugosi's Dracula is as captivating now as it was back in 1931, and Lugosi's iconic performance has set the standard for every personification of vampires since its release.  Phillip Glass's new score is interesting, but I found it a bit distracting.  View it both ways and see which version you like for yourself.

Gloria Holden was positively chilling as Dracula's Daughter, a delightfully wicked movie that picks up where the first Dracula film left off.

Son of Dracula with Lon Chaney Jr. moved the action to America's Deep South, among the bayous and the voodoo practitioners.  Dracula's son isn't quite as smart as his father was, and falls head-first into a plot for his own destruction; surprising, since vampires are supposed to be able to sniff out their enemy's plans...  But still an enjoyable ride.

And, of course, we have to have one fun-filled ride with ALL the monsters in one flick!  House of Dracula unites Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein under the roof of a kindly scientist-turned-madman.  Great fun!

The Spanish version of Dracula, while interesting - historically-speaking, seemed melodramatic and over-done.  But the extra footage with interviews and behind-the-scenes info was interesting.

As much as I have enjoyed these classic movies (many, many times!), I enjoy the extra features even more.  Stephen Sommers tells us how these old movies have inspired his own work, and the cast of Van Helsing joins him to share their perspectives of these timeless characters.  You'll also hear from Bela Lugosi's son, as well as his best friend.  Their memories of this great actor prove fascinating and well worth the price of the set.  In addition, you'll get interviews with several film historians that lend new insight into the characters we've shivered to for close to a century!

I've read several reviews about damaged DVDs, but I have been lucky -- both discs were perfect.  If you should happen to get a damaged set, keep trying.  This collection is well-worth the effort!",1128038400,4,2158,5.03954802259887
1989181,3,B0001CNRLG,"Take Bela Lugosi away from Tod Browning's Dracula and it would collapse completely. Even with him it doesn't hold up at all well, making 70 minutes feel like seven hours as it crawls its flatfooted way through the plot points with barely a trace of style or imagination, making for possibly the dullest classic ever made. George Melford's Spanish version shot simultaneously on the same sets is infinitely superior thanks to beautifully fluid direction and a better script, but even that eventually runs aground in endless dialog scenes and is hindered by the absence of Lugosi.

Dracula's Daughter starts off promisingly with Van Helsing arrested for the murder of Dracula only to be let off the hook when the count's daughter steals the body, but despite trying to bring something new to the formula through her desire to lose her family curse and live a normal life, in the end its all premise and no payoff. There's a mild lesbian frisson in Gloria Holden's scene with Nan Gray's model, but the film feels under-developed all the way and Marguerite Churchill's heroine is one of the most malicious and thoroughly unpleasant female leads imaginable.

Son of Dracula is in many ways the best of Universal's Dracula movies despite the studio's obsession with relocating their monster stable to the Deep South. Lon Chaney Jr. isn't quite as bad as usual as Count Alucard, but the real backbone of the film is a strong script with an interesting plot twist that's not afraid to leave its nominal hero in the throes of madness. The smoke effects are particularly enjoyable.

House of Dracula is another one of the studio's monster mashes, but and enjoyable one with good doctor Onslow Stevens finding himself with Dracula, the Wolfman and the Frankenstein Monster among his patients. But having spent so much time killing Dracula and curing Talbot (his lycanthropy is psychosomatic, apparently), it suffers from a rushed ending that barely has time to fit the good doctor going mad, reviving the Frankenstein monster, killing his loyal hunchbacked nurse before everything goes up in flames: in fact, he's so rushed off his feet that even Lionel Atwill's police chief and the rioting villagers only get a couple of shots, turning up just in time to run away. The real star of the show is John Carradine's Dracula, one of the most interesting screen interpretations, seducing his victim through music with a sad dignity that reminds you that sometimes the Devil really is a gentleman.

Sadly, once you get past the Lugosi film, the presentation falters. By putting the remaining four films on both sides of one disc, extras are suddenly non-existent and the discs are liable to problems: despite going through two copies, there are problems playing a couple of scenes in Son of Dracula and House of Dracula on a number of different players.

1989186,4,B0001CNRLG,Bela Lugosi was perfect for horror movies. Dracula was perfect for him. Bela looked like a ghost or a monster which made this movie even better. The newer dracula's are not so good but the older ones where perfect. Bela Lugosi was the best Dracula I ever seen.,1117497600,,260,4.4375
1989187,5,B0001CNRLG,"The Dracula Legacy Collection from Universal Pictures consists of 5 different movies which have had an impact on modern versions of vampire movies, books and television.

In ""Dracula,"" with Bela Lugosi, the character was given wings (pun slightly intended), giving audiences chills and feelings of desire (At least in the 1930's, anyway). Lugosi stepped into a character and made it his own. Without his performance, chances are ""Love At First Bite"" may not have been made (Remember George Hamilton's accent? And his line, ""I do not drink wine, and I do not smoke s***?""). This film basically filled American culture with bad Lugosi imitations ever since.

The Spanish version of ""Dracula,"" made at night using the same sets, looks almost identical to the English version, but the costumes are a bit more revealing (The English version had women wrapped tight; The Spanish version had low-cut outfits and women behaving in intensely sexual manners). You can't help but compare both versions and wonder which one was the superior version. If anything, this film may have given way to the foreign horror film culture (Like Ringu or Ju-on, which were made into the movies The Ring and The Grudge).

""Dracula's Daughter"" explores the guilt of the undead. The title character wants to purge her bloodthirsty nature, but finds that it's not as easy as she thinks. Some of the themes of the film can be found in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, ""Angel,"" or ""Forever Knight.""

""Son Of Dracula"" gives an answer to a question that some people may have on their minds: If given a chance, would you become one of the undead?  Again, this issue pops up in modern tales like ""Interview With The Vampire."" The film also gives birth to the now common use of the name Alucard (And if you have to ask about the name, then you're not a fan of the genre).

Finally, ""House Of Dracula"" gives birth to the ""monster mash,"" in which there is more than one monster in this film (Although I really don't like the fact that they considered the hunchback lab assistant, who is more an annoyance than anything, a monster. She's just a chick with a back problem!).

The collection has lots of goodies to it: commentary by David Skal, an introduction for the Spanish version of ""Dracula"" by its star, Lupita Tovar (Grandmother of the guys that did ""American Pie!""), an alternate soundtrack of Dracula with Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet, and trailers.

For the true movie fan and the true Dracula fan, this is a must have in your collection.",1112486400,2,2514,4.8032407407407405
1989188,4,B0001CNRLG,"For its time, it was a very good movie...  It's a classic.  I bought it because I'm into classic monster movies.  Dracula though isn't at the top of my list.  That space is for Frankenstein and the Wolfman.",1112140800,2,206,4.342105263157895
1989189,4,B0001CNRLG,"For fans of old horror films, this collection is a must have. Whenever one thinks of Dracula, usually the first image that comes to mind is the image of Bela Lugosi with the slicked back black hair with the pointy widow's peak - along with the traditional black cape and high collar. Even if one has never actually seen his film, people still somehow see Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula in their minds. That's how much this particular Dracula has been ingrained into our culture.

So finally, we get this film on DVD along with all the rest of the 1930's and 1940s Universal Dracula films including the Spanish version of Dracula in this nice Legacy collection. Actually in 1999, the restored uncensored Bela Lugosi version was released on DVD. With this Legacy collection, however, you do NOT get the restored uncensored version. So if you can find an out of print copy of the 1999 release, buy it because this new Legacy collection only has the original 1931 censored release. The uncensored version features Renfield screaming when Dracula chokes him at the end, as well as many more ""death groans"" from Dracula when Van Helsing drives the steak through his heart. This set does not have those features, so beware.

Aside from this flaw, this Legacy Collection is fantastic. And it's the first time ""House of Dracula"" (sequel to ""House of Frankenstein"") has been released to DVD. All the films have been digitally restored (although ""Dracula"" doesn't look as good as the rest because it's an older film). This set also features an optional new musical score by Phillip Glass for ""Dracula"" (1931), which was also on the 1999 release. In my personal opinion, however, the score takes away from the eerie feel of the film. I always thought the silence of the original made it more creepy. This new score has music running all the way through the film, and I feel it's too intense. Remember, silence is golden.

So if you're a fan of horror and Dracula, purchase this set. But make sure to find the 1999 restored uncensored release of ""Dracula"" and buy it as well since it's not available on this set.",1104969600,11,2103,4.724795640326976
1989190,5,B0001CNRLG,"In celebration of VAN HELSING, Universal has pulled out the classic monster movies and given them the royal treatment that has been long overdue to them.  This is the DRACULA box set, featuring five movies that tell the immortal saga of the count.

1. DRACULA (1931)
Count Dracula(Bela Lugosi)purchases Carfax Abbey in London and brings his newfound slave Renfield(Dwight Frye)with him.  Dracula sinks his teeth into the necks of Lucy Weston(Frances Dade)and Mina Seward (Helen Chandler).  Before the count can claim them as his brides, he must battle Jonathan Harker(David Manners)and Professor Abraham Van Helsing(Edward Van Sloan), Dracula's legendary nemesis.
While there have been film versions more true to the Bram Stoker novel, this film remains the definitive vampire movie of them all and opened the doors for future classics.  Tod Browning, while a mechanical director, definetley succeeds in creating a strong mood.  Karl Freund, the cinematographer, delivers a taste of some of his finest work.  Though other actors have played the role since this film, none have had that charisma or power that Bela Lugosi brought to the role.  He showed for all time who Dracula is.  The essence of evil incarnate.  Manners, Dade, and Chandler are rather dull.  Frye is stark raving brilliant in the role of Renfield, and Van Sloan is, to me, the true manifestation of Van Helsing.
JUDGEMENT: 96

2. DRACULA (1931 Spanish Version)
Count Dracula(Carlos Villaris)purchases Carfax Abbey in London and brings his newfound slave Renfield(Pablo Alvarez Rubio)with him.  Dracula sinks his teeth into the neck of the beautiful Eva (Lupita Tovar).  Before he claim her as his bride, the count must deal with Juan Harker(Barry Norton)and Professor Abraham Van Helsing(Eduardo Arozamena), Dracula's legendary nemesis.
Filmed alongside the Browning-Lugosi version, the film used the same sets and script, but had a completley different cast and crew, and also changed some scenes.  In all, the film is technically superior to Browning's.  George Melford, the director, is much better with sound and the camera angles are more fluid.  As for acting, Lupita Tovar is far more lively than Helen Chandler, and Pablo Rubio is even crazier than Dwight Frye.  On the other hand, Eduardo Arozamena is not as convincing as Edward Van Sloan, and the rest of the supporting cast is average.  Villarias, though good all throughout, lacks the charisma and striking appearance of Lugosi.  He tries, but never matches the Hungarian star who showed how a vampire should be played for all time.
JUDGEMENT: 89

3. DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936)
Countess Marya Zaleska(Gloria Halden)arrives in London shortly after her father is killed.  Professor Van Helsing(Edward Van Sloan)is arrested for the murder of Dracula, and fails to convince authorities that Dracula was a vampire.  Dr. Garth(Otto Kruger)is asked to help Van Helsing, yet he doesn't believe it.  He becomes acquainted with the countess and her servant(Irving Pichel), but soon begins to suspect that the bark is not worse than the bite.
Though it is the only entry that doesn't have Dracula in it, it's still a surprisingly strong film.  It takes the dark gothic elements of DRACULA and combines them with the witty and demented elements of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and creates a film that, while not as strong as either of those, is definetley worth a watch.  As the Countess, Gloria Halden perfectly captures the essence of Lugosi and having seen pictures of them together, they arguably look like family.  As the doctor, Kruger fills in nicely and does well with the material.  Van Sloan is also back in the role that made him famous.  Pichel is a bit rigid, and I would've rather had someone else play the part.  But I wasn't there.
JUDGEMENT: 95

4. SON OF DRACULA (1943)
Katherine Caldwell(Louise Allbritton)has invited Count Alucard(Lon Chaney, Jr.)to her home in Louisiana.  However, her fiancee Frank Stanley(Robert Paige)is troubled by the domineering count.  Claire Caldwell(Evelyn Ankers)is also worried about Kate.  Then, Frank kills her.  However, he claims that he shot the count, but the bullets just went through him and killed her.  He soon learns that Kate planned to marry the count so she could become his vampiric bride.  The count is the son of the legendary Count Dracula, and he has come to find new blood, with only two professors to stop him.
This third official entry in the series is when the character shows signs of slowing.  The film is enjoyable, but severly lacks in areas.  The acting is mostly dull, though Frank Craven and J. Edward Bromberg do a nice job.  Lon Chaney, Jr. seemed ideal for the count(his father Lon Sr. was originally going to play Dracula in 1931), but he delivers one of his weakest performances to date, lacking any energy and or charisma.
JUDGEMENT: 70

5. HOUSE OF DRACULA (1945)
Seeking a cure for his bloodsucking tendencies, Count Dracula(John Carradine)searches out the help of Dr. Edelman(Onslow Stevens)for a cure.  Believing Dracula to have a blood disease, he suggests injections of normal blood.  At the same time, the doctor searches for a way to cure Larry Talbot(Lon Chaney, Jr.)of his lycanthropy.  And in the middle of it all, the Frankenstein Monster(Glenn Strange)is found.  But when a transfusion goes wrong, the doctor himself becomes a monster.
At this point, the horror genre was really hurting, but not enough to stop making quality projects.  H.O.D is a fun film that provides pure popcorn entertainment.  Stevens has some good moments as Dr. Edelman, going from in control to crazed.  Carradine, as always, is excellent as Dracula.  So good that he comes close to matching Lugosi.  As always, Chaney, Jr. is tragic and powerful as Talbot, even though he only goes through one transformation in the whole movie.
JUDGEMENT: 88

EXTRAS
DRACULA comes with a commentary track by David J. Skal, who provides insightful info on the film.  THE ROAD TO DRACULA, hosted by Carla Laemmle, is also a strong extra.  The Spanish Version of Dracula has an introduction by Lupita Tovar, the star.  She briefly talks about the movie and compares Carlos Villarias and Bela Lugosi.  There is a documentary with the cast and crew of VAN HELSING, discussing their take on Dracula.  DRACULA also comes with the score by Phillip Glass, that can be chosen to be played during the movie.  I personally find the movie far more satisfying without any music.
JUDGEMENT: 89

OVERALL
With the film that arguably opened the doors for a new breed of horror and established one of the most imitated actors in Hollywood, as well as the Spanish take and three strong sequels, this is only slightly weaker than the FRANKENSTEIN box set, but strong nonetheless.

1989211,5,B0001CNRLG,"This ""review"" is in response to one placed here earlier which was entitled ""Slightly Flawed, but a good collection nonetheless"".  I understand this individual has an issue with this installment of the Legacy Collection due to the fact it does not contain Renfield's screaming and Dracula's extended groans upon his death.  He also stated that he wishes to receive a formal response from Universal as to why this is so.

  Due to the umbrella title that the film was released under, ""The Legacy Collection"", I would expect every movie offered in the set to be presented as they were shown to audiences when they were originally released in theatres.  In Webster's dictionary Legacy is defined as ""something received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past"".  Well, to present these films today, as they were offered to our ancestors who originally experienced these films in the past, the screams and groans were not there.  This is why I prefer this version to the DVD release of 2001.  For those of you who still insist on revising history, there are many avenues for you to acquire a copy of the Classic Monster Collection DVD.  By the way, yes I know the picture quality of the 2001 DVD is seen by many to be superior.  However, from the comparison I have seen at shillpages.com it isn't really that big of a deal.

  Incidentally, with this in mind, I have all six installments of The Legacy Collection and it is a realization of something I have waited over 20 years for.  The only thing I think keeps this entire collection from being perfect in my opinion is that the first two movies of The Creature series do not remain true to the Legacy left behind by those films.  I understand that you could never achieve the same results for 3-D on a TV screen as you can at the theatre, but to offer it in at least some capacity which attempted to loosely resemble the original theatrical experience would have been appreciated.",1100217600,7,1936,4.65
1989212,4,B0001CNRLG,"Having all these Dracula films in one place is a treat. The Spanish version is indeed well worth seeing (even if you need English subtitles to follow along!).

The flaw lies in the fact that the stand-alone version of Dracula, packaged as ""The Restored Version"" (with the Phillip Glass soundtrack and the Spanish version as bonuses) does indeed include audio of Renfield screaming as he is killed, as well as the extended groans of Dracula when Van Helsing (the marvelous Edward Van Sloan) destroys him. This audio is missing from the Legacy Collection, and thus mimics previously released versions such as the older VHS. Was this an oversight by the mastering techs of Universal, or did they seriously believe that 2004 audiences would find it excessively morbid (we're dealing with an undead creature who mind controls others and kills many, isn't that more distasteful than hearing the result of characters' destructions)? What's even more curious is that the commentary version (with David Skal)of the film is the same one from the restored version; therefore in this one you CAN hear Renfield's screams and the Count's extended groans (in fact Skal calls attention to the extended groans). I still await a formal response from Universal as to the omission of the restored version onto the Legacy collection.

Some may overly enjoy the Phillip Glass soundtrack, and while I find it interesting, I also find it rather busy and prefer to watch the Lugosi version with the original soundtrack.

The bonus films are all excellent. Dracula's Daughter picks up where the Lugosi version leaves off, minus the characters of Jonathon Harker and Mina Seward (the lovely Helen Chandler who met a rather sad end in the final years of her life). All that's left is Van Helsing (again Edward Van Sloan) who must defend himself as the destroyer of a centuries old vampire, rather than the murderer of a Hungarian count. Another dark, atmospheric film in the series and a lasting perfomance by the count's female counterpart.

Many later Universal horror films tend to get trite in comparison to the originals (the Kharis ""Mummy"" series pales when compared to Karloff's Imhotep), but Chaney does a fine job as Count Alucard (a rather silly name that is so easily revealed to be Dracula spelled backwards). Story lines are distorted from the original (Dracula was destroyed in Whitby in the 1930s, but is reported as having been destroyed in the 19th century), and while Alucard is Dracula, we don't know if he is the original or a son, or just another vampire du jour.

As is the case with Carradine as another Dracula in House of Dracula, but now we are treated to a ""best of"" horror fest. Dracula, the Wolf Man, and the Frankenstein monster in one film, what more can we ask?

The prints look excellent and are well worth owning. A true vampire devotee should seek out the prior Dracula DVD as well, however; the Renfield and Dracula screams are worth the effort.",1099785600,3,2953,4.872509960159363

1989214,4,B0001CNRLG,"Ok, if you like classic horror this is your collection.  If not you may want to rent the original Dracula and see if you want to get sucked into it the rest of the way.  I mean getting sucked into three sequels and one parallel version of the original made with the same sets with Spanish actors.

Dracula 4/5

Very atmospheric.  No music makes it sort of eerie.  It's hard to hear the actors in some parts.  Bela Lugosi has a great face for Dracula.

Dracula: Spanish Cast 3/5

Some people think it's better, but without Bela Lugosi it's not the same.  The Spanish cast set out to make improvements over the English version and the did suceede in some places, but not overall.

Dracula's Daughter 3/5

The music never stops.  It's really depressing.  Van Helsing is Von Helsing for some reason.  At least he's played by the same actor.  The couple from the end of the original Dracula has disappeared somehow leaving Van (Von) Helsing as the only witness.  It's bizzar.

Son of Dracula 3/5

The best of the sequels.  Count ""Alucard"" (Dracula backwards) comes to America.  I guess he's the son, due to the title, but no one ever refers to him that way.  There's some awsome transformation effects.  I.E. bat to human and cloud of vapor to human.  Good effects.

House of Dracula 2/5

Ok... This is a strange movie.  It's only a little over an hour long actually.  Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's Monster all meet for the second team up of the classic monsters.  The Wolf Man is cures, Dracula dies, and Frankenstein's monster dies in a fire after he is randomly discovered under a cliff in a cave.

This set is worth the money.  Good movies.  Haven't watched the commentary yet, but there's a documentary of it and a short with Steven Sommers talking about how Dracula inspired him to make Van Helsing.",1098316800,3,1812,4.565625

I'm not interested in the other ""B"" movies that are provided. I am perfectly happy with just watching Bela in all his glory. I would watch the others if Bela were in them but maybe one day when I'm bored I'll check them out. I've owned this film for about a month and I have maybe watched it 15 times already. I just can't keep my eyes off of Bela. He's charming, elegant and old fashioned (ex. ""Miss Mina, may I call later and inquire how you are feeling?"" sigh swoon)My absolute favorite part of this film is when Van Helsing shows Dracula the mirror with which he cast no reflection. One second, Dracula is calm and composed and as soon as Van Helsing shows him the mirror Dracula smashes the mirror and his whole face changed from pleasant to anger and hatred within a split second. Wonderful acting Bela! I haven't seen such wonderful acting in the newer films. The look in his eyes was so terrifying. The DVD transfer doesn't bother me because I don't remember the original therefore I have nothing to compare to. I don't even notice any imperfections. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates horror movies that don't shove special effects and such in your face.",1097971200,2,1346,4.431451612903226

  This movie lets him show all of these creepy mannerisms with great passion.  They aren't restricted to being creepy, they're also quite elegant.  In these days, with our Van Helsings and our Underworlds, there is no room for classic horror.  But I ask you to give this movie some kinda chance.

  It has some great acting and the story is creepy.  Just watch it alone in a dark room with plenty of space behind you.

The acting is top-notch, the dialogue just as good as any other film of the era and the sets conveyed just the right atmosphere.  Nothing like a good old b&w movie to set a mood.  Some young people say they don't like b&w movies.  How closed minded can you get?  When I was a teenager, I didn't let others my age influence me as to what to or listen or look at or wear.

1989219,4,B0001CNRLG,"Five films are featured in this set.  Most significant is the Tod Browning-directed version of Dracula.  This film is not quite the classic that many make it out to be, but it is still entertaining.  Lugosi, in his most noted performance, plays a vampire who is more suave than menacing, and Dwight Frye is fun to watch as Renfield.  There are many plot points unresolved, most particularly the final fate of Dracula's victim Lucy.  The Spanish version of Dracula addresses that point, but is essentially the same movie as the English version, having been shot at the same time and on the same sets.  It is also more entertaining than ""classic.""

Dracula's Daughter is the sequel to Dracula, and involves the vampire's ill-fated daughter.  She has the same craving for blood as her father, but at least feels guilty about her fate.  In Son of Dracula, Lon Chaney plays Dracula, who has moved to the American south to seek new victims; this strictly B-class movie has its moments but is a minor film.  Finally, in House of Dracula, all three of the great monsters are featured in the last of the series (except for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein); John Carradine plays the Count with icy competence, but the movie itself is nothing special.

DRACULA concerns the Transylvanian Count and his trip to his new digs, where he quickly takes a big bite out of his neighbors. Can Von Helsing stop this evil undead plague, or will Dracula win the night? DRACULA- THE SPANISH VERSION was filmed simultaniously with Bela's feature. It is quite good on it's own merit, with actors that took pride in their work. Some things are different in nuance as well as some actual (subtle) changes to the props, dialogue, action, etc. It's fun to watch! DRACULA'S DAUGHTER is about a woman who seeks the aid of a psychiatrist in dealing with her vampirism. Can a supernatural curse be broken by scientific / psychological means? Hmmm. SON OF DRACULA has Lon Chaney jr. as the returning nosferatu. Posing as Count Alucard, he terrorizes the countryside! HOUSE OF DRACULA has Lon jr. back as the wolfman, looking for a cure for his canine affliction. John Carradine is along for the ride as Count Dracula (w/ a snappy moustache).

They must be looking down with sheer joy to see their productions in all of this digital glory! The Count(and Countess Zaleska) does his thing to ladies of the evening until he meets his match in good ol' Edward Van""WE MUST DESTROY IT!!"" Sloan. They might as well have included the 1932 Karl Fruend Mummy on here because it is essentially the same story as the very stagy 1931 Dracula with 2 of the actors reprising characters under different names(Manners and Sloan as the romantic and scientist respectively), but I feel that the Mummy collection is coming so lets move on.
  Superior(maybe technically) Spanish version is on here and so is English version with the Kronos score. I, personally, can do without the Kronos score but there are those who were enchanted by this addition. Son of Dracula was a cut above the other WW2 era Universal monster vehicles as was Frank Meets Wolf!
Dracula's daughter could have been a Whale. One does wonder what James Whale would have done to this one. Actually, I feel that Dracula's Daughter(1936), which by the way was the last of its type from Universal before the slick assembly line productions came into being(starting with Son of Frank), is superior to the original. The score is superb, the acting far above the 1931 film, and well, lets face it how do you top Vampire lesbianism in the 1930's post flapper era??
  House of Dracula and House of Frankenstein almost seem to resemble what would become the staple of the blood-curdling technicolor productions from Hammer, and that was the BRAIN TRANSPLANTS. A deady body here and there, a brain pickled in a jar , a transplant to this one and this one, a suspicous burgomaster, a little decay and blood, you know the deal!
By the way, do you know how to tell when the first era of Universal horror ended?
ANSWER:Dracula's Daughter was the last Universal horror flick to utilize the pre-titles Earth-Globe with the old bi-plane circling.

The reason I say that is because there are so many great ways they have now. So that they can clean up an old movie. Even something like Dracula and I could tell that they really didn't try to do so.
 Also the movie comes in a beautiful DVD package. However, I find it difficult to open.
Not only that but the defects on both discs are rather annoying. I was disappointed that my computer got infected with the DVD for a while. So I had to restart it and start from were I was last off.
 I was kind of ticked off to because I was enjoying the movie very much.

The picture looks worse than the previous release and Dracula's extended groans at the end of the film after being staked are missing...but they can be heard on the commentary track! If you have the previous DVD edition of this film, keep it. It's definitely preferable to this version.
The best reason for buying this set is the second disc. It's a double sided disc that contains the Spanish version of Dracula, Dracula's Daughter, Son Of Dracula and House Of Dracula. It's great to be able to own all four of these classic films on one disc, and the transfers are more than acceptable for films of their age.
Other reviewers of these Legacy sets have commented on problems with the packaging and I echo those concerns. I found it very difficult to remove the second disc from the packaging. The problem is definitely with the disc as I put the first disc in that side of the case and it was easy to remove. I found it easier to put the second disc in a seperate DVD case rather than return it to its original packaging as I would rather not risk cracking the disc by continually trying to force it out of its place in the snapper case.",1085270400,36,1276,4.343096234309623
1989254,4,B0001CNRLG,"I watched all the movies and special things it contained and liked all of it. I've never really sat down and watched the original Dracula before but I have this urge to buy all these monster movies and watch them all. So my review: the original Dracula with Bela L. was the best IMO. The spanish version was good too but, Bela is the best. I didn't like the new music with Phil Glass, it didn't seem to fit in with the movie at all. These are all great horror films and the extra films like House of Dracula and Daughter of Dracula and the others were fun to watch as well. Mind you they are B movies and they aren't the best ever made but if you aren't too much of a critic and enjoy fun things like these then I recommend it.",1085011200,2,727,4.055555555555555
1989255,5,B0001CNRLG,"It is unfortunate that this collection of Universal Dracula films were only released in this mega-DVD collection as a means of promoting the film Van Helsing, but the important thing is that they were released - including the inimitably weird House of Dracula on DVD for the first time.  This collection inspired its own kind of bloodlust in my Dracula-loving heart, and I imagine all fans of Dracula and Universal's classic monsters movies of the 30s and 40s have either already purchased this set or are saving up the money to do so.  Just look at the bounty of riches included here: the original 1931 classic Dracula starring Bela Lugosi, which you can view with both its original score as well as the modern score composed by Philip Glass and performed by the Kronos Quartet; the incredible and technically superior Spanish language version of Dracula; Dracula's Daughter (1936); Son of Dracula (1943) starring Lon Chaney, Jr.; House of Dracula (1945); an original documentary, The Road to Dracula, discussing the making of the English and Spanish versions of the original film; a commentary by film historian David J. Skal on the original film; theatrical trailers for the films; and, last and certainly least, a look at how the original Dracula franchise influenced director Stephen Sommers in the making of his new film Van Helsing.
I waited a long time to watch the Spanish version of the Dracula, and it lived up to its reputation.  A much more complete and compelling version of the film, aided by an additional half hour running time, this movie equals or excels the English language version of the film in all ways - except, of course, for the performance of Bela Lugosi, who simply is Count Dracula.  As for the Lugosi version, I'm torn between the two scores.  As a traditionalist, I tend to favor the original score, but certain scenes, particularly those involving Dracula's predatory approach to his victims are made much more powerful with the addition of the Glass score.  Either way, though, Bela Lugosi is the main attraction, and his iconic performance defines Count Dracula to this very day.
The three Dracula sequels vary in quality, none of them living up to the reputation of the original.  Dracula's Daughter takes the story in an interesting direction, giving us a vampire who seeks help in freeing herself of the Dracula curse, and Gloria Holden gives a formidable and nuanced performance as the daughter of the Count.  Son of Dracula, on the other hand, pretty much lays an egg in my opinion.  The only interesting thing about this movie is the debate over the true identity of the Count - is he Dracula? the son of Dracula? a relative of Dracula?  In the end, it really doesn't matter, but it seems obvious that the blood of Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula certainly doesn't run in the veins of ""Count Alucard"" because this new bloodsucker on the block isn't the smartest vampire in the castle.  Many Dracula fans will of course be aware of the fact that Lon Chaney, Sr., was the original choice to play Dracula in the 1931 film; his death opened the way for the relatively unknown Bela Lugosi to take on the role he had already played hundreds of time on stage.  In Son of Dracula, Lon Chaney, Jr., gets the chance to don the cape; Chaney earned his spot of fame in the Universal monster pantheon, but he didn't earn it as the Count - his performance is nothing short of boring, aided not one iota by a surprisingly weak script from the hand of Curt Siodmak.
The addition of House of Dracula to The Dracula Legacy Collection is a very big deal, for this is the first time this film has found its way to DVD.  House of Dracula is a really weird film, as this sequel of sorts to House of Frankenstein features not only Count Dracula, but Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man as well.  John Carradine plays a quite pedestrian Count Dracula, while Lon Chaney, Jr., plays the Wolf Man; Frankenstein's monster is played by Glenn Strange, but the monster plays only the most minor of roles in the story.  The action takes place in Vasaria (wherever that is), where Dr. Franz Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is pursuing his own rather wacky scientific experiments, placing great hope on some new kind of spore he is growing in his private little hothouse.  Both Count Dracula and Larry Talbot (the Wolf Man) come seeking his help; Talbot's wish to banish the Wolf Man manifestation from his life is understandable, but Dracula's reasons for seeking help are never made clear.  In the course of trying to help these two special patients, Edelman runs into the body of Frankenstein's monster in a cave underneath his sanitarium (in a rather ho-hum fashion, no less).  As you might expect, this association with three monsters turns out to be a bad thing, leaving Edelman in a pretty bad fix himself.  It's somewhat difficult to take this movie seriously, but it does provide some wacky good fun in a campy sort of way.
There is a slight risk involved with purchasing The Dracula Legacy Collection, but the rewards are worth the risk.  Just be careful opening the case - even if both of the DVDs (one of which is double-sided) remain in position, you are likely to find a little knob underneath each one just dying for the chance to scratch a disc.",1084665600,172,5261,4.722707423580786
1989256,5,B0001CNRLG,"THE DRACULA LEGACY collection is a nice package including the original DRACULA starring Bela Lugosi in an iconic movie that endures on.  Also included are the Spainish version of DRACULA (shot on the same sets at night as Bela's version!), the sequels -- DRACULA'S DAUGHTER, SON OF DRACULA, and HOUSE OF DRACULA (all three monsters show up for the finale).  You get five movies, and some great extras.  Like many reviewers I found one disc rolling around the inside of the package.  Fortunately it was not scratched!  That's the only downside to these collections I have found.
You get the 1931 original appearance of a cinematic DRACULA!  With two soundtrack options - listen to it in its original almost silent version, or chose the revamped Phillip Glass soundtrack version.  Todd Browning who directed this classic was foremost a silent film maker, and DRACULA was designed to be shown in theatres with and without sound.  So its almost creepier and more effective to see it with its long spooky silences intact.  But Glass is a great musician, and I appreciate his soundtrack as well.  It really depends on mood. And for fun check out the SPAINISH version which used the same sets.  Beautifully shot, and considered by some technically superior to Browning's film!  It uses more camera moves and visual effects.
The other films are a string of B sequels that are still a lot of fun.  Gloria Holden as DRACULA'S DAUGHTER is surprisingly creepy and troublingly lesbian in tone.  She only attacks women!  SON OF DRACULA is campy fun with Lon Chaney Jr. sailing through smokey swamps.  HOUSE OF DRACULA is the ultimate monster mash with Frankenstein, the Wolfman, and Dracula making appearances in this last sequel to the Universal monster franchise before they all appeared in an Abbot and Costello movie that killed them for a while.
But they live on!  My only beef with the extras is one where Stephen Sommers talks about how DRACULA influenced VAN HELSING.  I don't want to tie my 1931 version of a classic to this year's Summer Hit.  But in a way it proves ...

1989257,3,B0001CNRLG,"Disc One is great...the chilling Lugosi classic, a documentary, commentary tracks...beautifully packaged bonus features for horror buffs.
Disc Two, however...a real disappointment.  Full of glitches which made the viewing experience maddening.  Hopefully your copy won't be similarly damaged.
What's all the fuss about the Spanish version?  Give me Dwight and Bela ANY day!
The Universal sequels aren't much fun, either.  DRACULA's DAUGHTER is dreck!  Illogical yawner.  SON OF DRACULA and HOUSE OF DRACULA, while neither could be called spooky in the least, still manage to capture the nostalgic feel of Saturday matinees.  Lon Chaney and John Carradine are both laughable casting choices, but the flying bats...misty marshes...and hunchbacked assistants make for fun viewing.",1084492800,,777,5.823008849557522
1989258,3,B0001CNRLG,"The transfers are as good as I would hope for. However, all the discs were loose in their container and rattling about. The first disc had a crack at the center hole. It doesn't seem to hurt the viewing, but since it was opened I have no recourse. All of the collections purchased, Frankenstein, Wolfman,and The Sherlock Holmes sets arrived the same way. It is really appalling at this slipshod manner of selling merchandise. Individuel DVDs are tight in their packaging, but the collections are, pardon the expression, the pits. One wonders what I will find as I go through these movies over the months. I hope I find no more surprises. These classics deserve better treatment. Again I do like the transfer on the Dracula disc and the rest will probably be the same. At least I hope so. Who knows how many scratches and bumps have been added to the pristine originals by the packaging? Only the the Shadow...",1083974400,4,909,4.6521739130434785

8010150,5,B0001CNRLG,"Of all the films that are gathered in this collection, the one that always gets overlooked is HOUSE OF DRACULA. Coming at the end of Universal's classic horror cycle (sorry A & C fans but A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN doesn't count), HOD turns out to be a surprisingly good swan song. It is an improvement over the previous entries (FRANKENSTEIN-vs-The WOLF MAN, HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN) despite the fact that it borrows scenes from several previous movies and runs a scant 61 minutes. Of all the 1940s films it remains my personal favorite foe a number of reasons.

Workhorse director Erle C. Kenton, who 13 years earlier had created the remarkable ISLAND OF LOST SOULS for Paramount as well as earlier Universal sequels, somehow managed to recreate several of the elements that made IOLS a horror classic. The atmospheric lighting and photography go hand in hand with the familiar recycled music from earlier Universal horrors and the editing deserves special mention for not only telling the story in an effective, cinematic manner but for also incorporating shots from previous Frankenstein movies. The recycled sets are fantastic too.

What really sets HOD apart from the previous series entries are the surprisingly good performances that Kenton is able to get from his cast. Chaney's Lawrence Talbot hasn't been this good since THE WOLF MAN while John Carradine's Dracula is extremely effective with his smooth delivery and his hypnotic eyes. For my money though the movie belongs to virtual newcomer Jane Adams as the tragic hunchback nurse Nina and especially veteran supporting player Onslow Stevens as the sympathetic Jekyll & Hyde doctor. The scene with his disappearing mirror reflection is still memorable.

Although last in the series, HOUSE OF DRACULA is actually the ideal place to start. It is completely self contained and can function on its own while the earlier 1940s offerings seem like the ongoing sequels that they are. This set also contains Bela Lugosi's iconic 1931 take on the character as well as the Spanish version, the last Laemmle family produced horror film DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936), and the bizarre Southern Gothic SON OF DRACULA (1943). All in all an outstanding set of Universal Horrors and while it may not be the set's best, HOUSE OF DRACULA is the one I keep returning to.",1469923200,,2304,5.041994750656168
8010151,5,B0001CNRLG,"Dracula - Legacy Collection

This product has five vampire movies from the 1930s and 1940s, all in monochrome. The first DVD has the original 1931 ""Dracula"", with another version with the Philip Glass music. The second double-sided DVD has the Spanish language version that used the same sets but different actors (and a slightly different script), and ""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936) on side one. The other side has ""Son of Dracula"" (1943) and ""House of Dracula"" (1945). Legends of vampires go back thousands of years to Classical Greece, and India and China. The signs of a vampire victim were: pallor, fatigue or listlessness, a loss of weight, and death. These are the same symptoms of a person with tuberculosis, an often fatal disease until the developments of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century. Screenwriter Kurt Siodmak was credited with inventing some of the legends about vampires and werewolves. The historic Dracula is a national hero in Romania, the novel was never translated into Romanian (but most other languages).

The 1931 ""Dracula"" movie was adapted from a stage play that dramatized Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. The plague of tuberculosis in the 19th and 20th century must have generated belief in vampires. Before the discovery of the germ theory sickness was attributed to divine wrath (punishment for sins) or to curses and spells by witches or people in league with the devil. The belief in witches followed the Renaissance and science of the sixteenth century. Witches caused diseases, that is why they were hunted down and killed. The 1931 Spanish language version was produced at night, the morning was used for the English language version. Whenever possible the same scenes were used in both movies, that may explain the scenes without sounds. This version retained its full 105-minutes, the English version was later cut back to 75 minutes and shown as a ""B"" movie. The censors of the British Empire banned horror films around 1937. ""Dracula"" is a mystery or detective story about the search for a mysterious serial killer.

""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936) is another of the sequels that are common in Hollywood. A very successful movie keeps on repeating as long as it attracts an audience. See ""Jaws"" or ""Psycho"".

""Son of Dracula"" (1943) is the best of the sequels. A mysterious foreigner, Count Alucard, visits a small town in America. Can the people extinguish his predations?

""House of Dracula"" (1945) is the last of the sequels during this era. It is an average story that seems to put an end to the monsters. At least until the economy and market research decides there is an audience for this type of movie. Then a new generation of movies are produced and marketed.

The 1931 ""Dracula"" with the Philip Glass score adds light music to the story. It fills in the silent scenes. Movie theaters were in transition to talking movies and people were used to quiet passages. There are books on the subject of Dracula. The legend of Dracula may be a parable on the spread of ""bad blood"" that dooms a victim.",1468195200,,3037,4.9450980392156865
