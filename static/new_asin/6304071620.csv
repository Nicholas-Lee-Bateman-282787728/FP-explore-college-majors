7860866,4,6304071620,"An excellent movie for either man or woman.  It has its scary side, in the character of Lyle, a psychopath, a love interest in Jack and Willie, and from a male point of view, Mia Sara is wonderfully gorgeous even when she tries not to be.  Her one nude scene is well worth seeing.  She is just as attractive nude as she is clothed, if not more so.  Not worth 5 stars, but worth at least 4.",1126656000,4,389,4.012987012987013
7860867,2,6304071620,"Okay - so a cast of three was pretty impressive.  Charles Dance was incredibly impressive.
But the silly struggle of emotions between Lou Diamond and Mia was out of place and just bad.  Their reactions to situations was terrible.  Lou Diamond's mock-rage in the rain, in the truck were like a wacky Godzilla acting lesson.  It didn't get better.  And the sudden sex between the two characters was just whacked considering the positions they were in already.
It was worth 1 watch and 1 watch only on a lazy Sunday afternoon with no better prospects.",991526400,6,548,4.726315789473684
7860868,5,6304071620,"I wouldn't have thought a movie about three people trapped in a house in the woods would be as compelling as this way cool Showtime film.  Director Eric Red, working again with his writing partner Kathryn Bigelow, creates a  moody, atmospheric, and exeptionally well-acted story about a stranded  drifter battling with a psychotic and creepy mountain man over his  beautiful young wife in the U.S. backwoods.  Strong photography and wild  action set pieces, plus super performances by Charles Dance and Lou Diamond  Phillips (and even Mia Sara!), made this, for me, a worthwhile watch.  Watch out for the boiler in the basement.  My only complaint was it looked  like the film was shot in Europe, with the director having to create  Tennesse over there.  I could tell because the mountain man's truck was a  Russian military Ural (although it admittedly looked much more sinister  than an American Peterbilt or Mack).  It reminded me of Red's movies  ""THE HITCHER"", ""NEAR DARK"", and ""BAD MOON"".  Rent it!",948326400,5,1004,4.987878787878788
