8650750,3,B00DBSFY7C,"These four concerts DVDs are okay. They do show parts of the concerts. I have seen the complete concert with George Harrison (I've forgotten which year, I think it was 1987) before on HBO. The DVD of that concert only showed one song that he performed on that night. So, I was disappointed that I didn't get the whole concert. I can only assume that the other three DVDs are the same - that is, they show only some of the concert. The 1989 and 1990 DVDs mostly show performers I am not familiar with, but that is okay.

Therefore, my overall rating would have to indicate that these DVDs are okay as far as they go, but I am disappointed that I didn't get the whole concert for each of these years.",1377561600,4,698,4.2481203007518795
