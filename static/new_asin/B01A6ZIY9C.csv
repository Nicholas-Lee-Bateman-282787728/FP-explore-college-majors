8746623,5,B01A6ZIY9C,I love love love this movie!  It has a beautiful presentation of the important things in life without getting too overbearing.  The heart sensations this film generated were ones that stayed with me long after viewing.  Love the songs and the acting and bright visual styling.  Ranbir Kapoor is my new favorite Bollywood actor.  I'm so starry-eyed!,1464307200,2,348,5.035087719298246
