The film begins on a cobblestone road. Horses draw carriages. A man with a lantern is attacked in the dark. We see a weird ceremony being held over a young woman (like some porno-horror movie). Can she be rescued? Lord Blackwood is unmasked. Inspector Lestrade arrives with his Bobbies to arrest the gang. Next we see Baker Street. Watson plans to move out, Holmes is bored at home. They dine out, Holmes meets Mary Morstan (who needs no introduction). Holmes gets a glass of wine. Next we see a bare-knuckle fight in a pit. Holmes fights a bigger and heavier opponent, and wins. We see a dark and dirty London. Holmes wears no hat! Blackwood makes a prediction: three more. Holmes gets a visit from Irene Adler, she has a request. Holmes has a trick here. Inspector Lestrade summons Holmes about Blackwood! Dr. Watson is involved too. Blackwood's coffin is opened, there is a surprise! [How did it happen?] They enter an apartment to search for clues. There is drama and entertainment. [What, no revolver?]

There is a chase for action in a shipyard. Lestrade wants Holmes to see a High Official who wants to stop Blackwood from doing evil. Holmes visits Irene Adler and opens a bottle of wine. After he is rescued, he visits the rooms of that High Official. Sir Thomas is dead. There is a meeting. Blackwood plans for a New World Order. He can't be stopped! These important people control the police. Holmes and Watson explore the shore. They find a slaughterhouse and rescue a woman. There is a trap! The story continues. Can Holmes defeat the villainous Blackwood? Holmes uses symbolism to foretell Blackwood's plans. Is there a plot to attack Parliament for a coup d'etat? Holmes deduces that a poison gas will be used to kill Parliament. Can they overpower the villains and stop the infernal machine? [You know the answer.] There is a final struggle high over the river. Holmes explains how the magic tricks were done by Blackwood. The villain falls from his heights, like Lucifer. Irene Adler survived to tell about the Professor. ""We'll see about that."" Then a Bobbie brings news of a murder, and Holmes has a new case.

Do you remember those Sherlock Holmes movies from the 1940s? This is a modern version with a bigger budget but not a better story. Its more complex than those simpler monochrome movies. You can see the special effects of CGI, they are not overdone. This story is different from Doyle's writings, and overlong. Aside from the scenery, this could have been a ""James Bond"" adventure story where the world is saved from a powerful madman.",1454889600,,2591,4.753333333333333
