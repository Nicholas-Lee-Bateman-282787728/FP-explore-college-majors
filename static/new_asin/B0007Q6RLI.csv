8050399,4,B0007Q6RLI,"This is a PAL format disk, not NTSC. Be sure you can play it before ordering.

Otherwise it's nice if you are a fan of Steeleye Span.",1355184000,2,133,3.925925925925926
8050400,1,B0007Q6RLI,"The DVD we ordered was in European [PAL] format, not US format.  Unfortunately we didn't see this specified in the product description [maybe it was there].  But the seller was extremely accommodating about taking it back.  Immediate response to my email, quick to say ""of course"" he'd take it back.  It's been mailed and I'm waiting for the U.S. postal service and Royal Mail to deliver it to seller so that I can get my refund.",1328313600,2,429,4.605263157894737
