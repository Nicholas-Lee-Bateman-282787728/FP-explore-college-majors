He thinks he is funny but he is not even clever. If he was trying to play the fool, he was not good at it -- he was just foolish to think he had a film. So where is the humor?

It was nice to see some shots of BA but they were not long enough or well set up enough to let you really study or get a good feel for any one place. I am going to bet that you can find more on Youtube or some travel progam

A travelogue it was not!!! A comedy it was not!!!! A true story it was not!!!! A compelling piece of fiction it was not!! A decent student film it was not!!!

Slap-dash it was indeed.

How did it end up on a commercial DVD? It must have been subsidized by a close friend or a relative.

The ""behind the scenes"" is misleading. There is no behind the scenes and in this sense it is arguably false advertising. He only sits in a chair and explains that his original film project in BA fell through and there he was on-site with a local film crew hired and had to do something. So etc. Then bingo that is it -- end of ""behind the scenes."" Only a couple of minutes of sob story in all. He says he wanted to do something about the plight of the homeless in BA, but instead of filming and say interviewing some Argentine homeless, he hogs the spotlight with an unconvincing made up story about himself being out on the streets down there. Just silly, without being funny.

This film is not for everyone!!!!!!!!!",1378080000,,1504,4.026845637583893
8522780,5,B007WZTM1E,I really enjoyed Mike Dalton's adventure from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires.  The Buenos Aires cinematography was beautiful and I really want to go to Argentina now.  This is a mockumentary making fun of people who seemingly have it all but are never satisfied.  Materialistic people need to watch this film so they can get another perspective on life.,1353456000,3,350,4.898305084745763
