4107562,5,B003BVY5WE,"This DVD is really done as ""research material"" for those who study the Bible, prophecy, and information on the groups working to create the New World Order. It was not produced for entertainment, and is driven by information rather than production value.

Doc Marquis is considered an expert on the occult, and presents unique insights that you simply will not find anywhere else. Nevertheless, the DVD is shot as a ""talking head"" presentation, with minimal graphics and no special effects. In the past, Marquis appeared on Oprah Winfrey, Geraldo Rivera (along with shows like Hard Copy and Inside Edition) -- back in the 80's when they used to do stories on cults, etc. If you value unique research, and the rather ""peculiar"" personality of Marquis himself, then you will find the presentation fascinating. If you are looking for a ""History Channel type"" documentary, then this is not for you. If you are looking to be entertained, then this is not for you. But if you want to understand the working of occult societies and how they manipulate the world around us to achieve their aim of creating a global society, this is a great DVD.

Also, Chris Pinto is NOT the director of this presentation. It turns out his company, Adullam Films, did the camera work and sound for this DVD, but not the editing or overall production.",1289174400,3,1325,4.807017543859649
4107563,1,B003BVY5WE,"Unfortunately I bought three films of the Doc Marquis series (which I all returned). The ""movies"" are cheap self - made home videos with no professional quality, containing each 2.5 hours of Doc Marquis monologues and some zoom in into photocopies and low quality photos. The movie are highly recommended for people with sleeping problems - they will guaranteed let you fall asleep! Chapter dividers and charts/exhibits are typewritten pieces of paper with a zoom in. None of the title editors or animation tools which are available today even for cheap home movies are used.

The content of the movies itself is poorly researched rubbish uttered and stuttered by Doc Marquis.  Messrs. Doc Marquis & Chris Pinto would have done better to hire a professional voice (speaker) than torturing the audience to listen to Doc Marquis. Anybody interested in the subject of the DVD's should stay away from these movies as far as you can. They are an utterly waste of time and money and should be removed from the Amazone.com inventory. -

I bought the movies because of the director Chris Pinto's excellent DVD series ""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings"". The director has discredited himself by his involvement in the Doc Marquis series of low quality cheap home movies. I will stay away from other movies bearing his name. This is a real tragedy judging from the quality of ""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings"".

Doc Marquis will now claim that my comments were written by the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers to discredit him. -  I can assure you that this is not the case,  and if you do not believe it,  buy the videos and judge yourself - You have been warned!!",1283644800,6,1669,4.876325088339223

Doc is not only an expert on the occult but a man who loves and stands for the Bible,",1511913600,,253,4.291666666666667

8394022,5,B003BVY5WE,Very good DVD. I learned a lot of things  examples: George Washington and John Adam's letters taking on the Illuminati. The death of Captain Morgan.,1488412800,,148,4.92
8394023,5,B003BVY5WE,I have watched the entire series and am impressed by the overwhelming amount of compelling evidence that Doc presents.  This video as part of the whole really helps develop a much clearer picture of how the end times prophecies are being brought into fulfillment.  This information provides some insight into what the final one world religion will look like.  I thank God for Doc and others like him who have escaped a fateful destiny and are bold enough to teach others the truth about what is really going on behind the scenes.,1471996800,,529,4.728260869565218

8394026,5,B003BVY5WE,Anyone who is interested in the Illuminati and what their religion is all about would like this 2 disc series. It gives you all the insight about what they really believe.,1359072000,2,171,4.548387096774194
8394027,5,B003BVY5WE,"It's been said in order to help someone to find salvation through Jesus Christ you must first help them to realize that they are lost and in need of a savior.  Anyone who watches this video should have no problem realizing that the devil has tricked them into wondering around aimlessly in darkness, like Doc Marquis says in the video you are no longer without excuse.",1334707200,,368,4.575757575757576
