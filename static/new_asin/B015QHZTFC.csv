7446354,4,B015QHZTFC,"Nice 10 DVD set. Comes in a factory sealed box with each individual DVD shrink wrapped. We put them in a Region 1 (U.S.A. and Canada) DVD player and they played fine. Only one DVD, ""Counting On Lemonade"", is a DVD + Digital combo. The other nine are plain DVD's. I think some are older designs/models perhaps - the characters and DVD cases are not uniform. These are a fun and different way for kids to learn. My kids love these and it helps my special needs child learn letter(s) and number concepts. These would be great as individual gifts or as a whole set.

7446368,5,B015QHZTFC,"We have tried Leapfrog, Preschool Prep, and Rock & Learn.  We like Rock & Learn well enough, we find Preschool Prep to be tedious and dull (though we still use them occasionally when my 4 YO is not in high-demand for entertainment), but we absolutely find Leapfrog to be educational, entertaining, and completely adorable.
You will need the original Letter Factory video (just the letter sounds) in addition to this set if you really want your child to know letter sounds (without effort).  The Scout and Friends video that goes over letter sounds just wasn't as effective with the mnemonics as Letter Factor.  The Letter Factory video and this set will provide hours of entertainment and have your child surprising you with their knowledge - both great aspects to these stellar videos.",1527206400,16,786,4.9393939393939394

7446371,5,B015QHZTFC,"Super awesome mega pack of Leap Frog dvds! This is a much better deal, to buy them together in a bundle, than to buy them separately. What a great product to help your child learn their letters, numbers, shapes and work on words! Can't recommend this product more!! I would buy it again!!",1525564800,,288,4.452830188679245
7446372,5,B015QHZTFC,"I bought this for my 3 month old grandson so he could learn while being entertained. These videos are great for teaching phonics, spelling, and math. I used this exact line with my youngest son when he was a toddler and he was reading at age three thanks to leap frog products! Im hoping my 26 year old can teach his son to read early with leap frog dvds and interactive books.",1525478400,,377,4.25

7446381,5,B015QHZTFC,"We're finally ""encouraging"" our toddler to watch these in the car rides rather than watching Paw Patrol and Peppa Pig on repeat as we've done for a long time. They're more like stories with a good message and didactic components, rather than a boring learn this and learn that type of thing as I thought they would be. Each story is a bit short, roughly 30-40 minutes of content per DVD, which seems like a waste of space but oh well.",1523404800,3,434,4.37037037037037
7446382,5,B015QHZTFC,Who thought a DVD would teach my child to read?  He's obsessed with showing me which letters hes learned as we drive down the road  - pointing at signs and stores.  They're cute and not too hard to watch as adults and really do hold a little one's attention. Well-worth it.  I wish I'd bought them earlier.,1523232000,,306,4.315789473684211

7446384,5,B015QHZTFC,"Great price for ""letter factory"" DVD's as my 2 year old calls them. He absolutely loves these and they help teach him letters, numbers, reading, etc. After a long trip with these in the van he noticeably reads more words now. It's not really why we bought them but it's nice that screen time can also be educational.",1522627200,,316,4.4655172413793105

7446386,5,B015QHZTFC,My 2 year old loves these. They are great in that they are 35 minutes long - just long enough for mom to get something done quick but not too long that the kids veg out! And I catch my son singing the songs about letter sounds and numbers all the time. Music to my ears!,1522108800,,270,3.8392857142857144
7446387,5,B015QHZTFC,I bought this set of DVDs for my classroom. I teach Pre-K and use these videos each morning as the students are arriving to the classroom. My students have learned so much in the short tie I have been using these videos. They will ask for them. Keeps the kids engaged and they don't even realize they are learning.,1521936000,,314,4.338983050847458

7446389,5,B015QHZTFC,My son is 2 years old. He had a level 3 brain hemorrhage when he was born and we were told he would have CP but wouldnt know to what extent until he was old enough to read what the extent of his learning disabilities would be. I first bought the letter factory for him when he was about 10 months old. He watched it every day when we drive to his babysitters and on the way home. He watched letter factory for about 3 months until he had learned all of his letters and sounds. Then we switched to Math Circus and he can count to 15 but not perfectly but he counts to ten perfectly. Now he is watching shapes. He absolutely loves these and will not watch anything else. He looks to sing to the music. He has learned so much from these and I am so grateful that we found them,1520208000,,773,3.9935483870967743

Although the one she had was not included this is a great set and a steal of a deal. The songs are catchy. They get your little ones sounding out words, learning numbers, basic reading skills. Honestly these are perfect for the car which is why i grabbed them but hes been watching them non stop in the house as well. Id recommend these for sure. Ill include pics of the dvds so you can see them.",1519430400,5,554,4.138888888888889

It keeps all of their attention, teaches them things, and has them singing along. Cute songs have mom and dad occasionally singing along.

7446417,3,B015QHZTFC,"It's ok as far as the shows go, but really they need to package this in a single container like many other multi disc shows or all on one disc. These are such short shows you could fit several to one disc. But at the least I think they should package this in one disc container like the Carmen Sandiego or The Littles discs. It is just cumbersome and takes up way too much space especially in the car with the dvd player. So for that I really had to take down my stars because it is just too obnoxious packaged this way. It could save a lot on waste products. I wish more companies consider the economical and environmental impact of their products.",1500854400,,649,4.241935483870968

7446446,5,B015QHZTFC,"My son is learning English as a second language in Japan right now, and the LeapFrog DVDs help him with his listening, pronunciation, and grammar far more than I like to give credit. It may be hard to understand at first, but just keep watching. They start understanding from the letters, how to make words, etc...
I've been reading books with him and his comprehension levels have gone through the roof.

Highly recommended for any young child learning to read!",1483401600,8,462,4.775

7446455,2,B015QHZTFC,Dissapointed with the quality of the videos and video variety. Im guessing they just haven't been updated to current tv ratios (i.e. HD television) because the color and picture quality are bad. Really dissapointed that the videos were more for ages 4 and up. I was not able to see the titles included but assumed theyd be more of basic alphabet and number videos. Seller should list the video titles.,1479600000,9,401,4.742857142857143

Leapfrog is no secret- they have been around for years and I used them back when I was a teacher and I'm glad they are still available and popular now for my own son!  This mega pack is a perfect starter pack and my son begs to watch them daily.  They are repetitive and that is part of the point to instill learning concepts that stick with you (him), but I am ready to add more to our 'rotation' already, lol!

Definitely worth the purchase!",1535500800,,519,4.212121212121212

I played Phonics Farm on Netflix and he absolutely LOVED it! He's still mostly non-verbal, but he started saying the letters with them on the show! I was bummed that they took the program off of Netflix so I knew that I had to buy the set. He's not quite as interested in the other dvds yet, but he'll probably grow into them.",1535328000,,463,4.155555555555556
