494126,4,6302690420,"A month before I rented this video, I was driving cross country and broke down near the TINY town of Demming, New Mexico. While my car was being repaired I wandered around and got a real feel for the desolate  surroundings and wondered what life there must be like. The first time I  saw ""Gas Food Lodging"", I was immediately struck by how familiar  the town looked, and realized that it was filmed in Demming! Having been in  this little place with not a lot to see or do, I could totally relate to  the frustrations of the characters to be living there. The acting of  everyone was superb, especially the very uncomfortable scenes of family  disputes. The story is rather depressing, but very real, and I applaud the  efforts of all involved.",961372800,2,744,4.541353383458647

The hardship of everyday life. I know this sounds like most of the  movies these days but it's not. It is down to earth, no nonsense in it. I  felt like I was watching a persons real life. The discovery of love in the  different places, the idealism of youth that I had lost so long ago. I must  see for anyone who seeks meaning in anything.

GAS FOOD LODGING: ""What does woman want?"" Freud asked a century ago. Good question. Maybe the same thing most men want: To love and be loved, with some assurance that it will last. In other words, the impossible. Anders' directorial debut illustrates the three phases of women's relationship to men: Young Shade is brimming with mystery, hope and romance; beautiful Trudi is trapped between yearning and cynicism, destined to be a victim of circumstance; world-weary Nora has few illusions left, just disenchantment. Despite their experiences, all three are in equal measure tough and vulnerable, hurt yet hopeful, defensive and sensitive--and this film displays a tender clemency and vast compassion for their plight.

Is it a ""chick flick""? Oh, yeah. But it's also a human movie, one that deserves to be appreciated by women and by the men who want to understand what they want. Bittersweet and innocent, wistful and hopeful, worldwise and sympathetic, ""Gas Food Lodging"" is a sweetly somber film which excels in conveying that aching yearning for connection that so often yields only disappointment--and is so seldom satisfied.",1422489600,,1389,5.034782608695652
494211,4,6302690420,"A delightful and sensitive picture of a single mother and her two teenage daughters that gives an unusually good picture of the lives of women in a bleak society with rotten values.  Not depressing, however.  Often amusing. They live in a trailer park in New Mexico.  The social landscape is bleak, but the wide spaces and distant mountains give a feeling that there is so much more to life than these women have ever had a chance to experience.",1414972800,2,445,4.6075949367088604

Sometimes the little girl narration and the Spanish film stuff might be sort of cutesy but it's never bad and the movie triumphs as an American gem.

494218,5,6302690420,"I can only recommend to everyone, even guys and men to watch this little movie only once. GAS FOOD LODGING is nothing less but A BEAUTIFUL TALE about coming of age, love, and caring despite all the little sticks in the wheels that might occur along the way.

A mother (Brooke Adams) tries to raise her 2 daughters alone in a deserted new Mexico town. The oldest one Trudi (Ion Skye)is a daydreamer, promiscuous young woman but when she happens to meet a young boy that will in return treat her as badly as she used to treat other guys, she's left with nothing but her mother (Not so much a role model). And her younger sister Shade (Fairuza Balk)who fantaisizes about love, and about finding a man for her mom while watching Mexican love stories in a deserted theater near her home. But Shade will too learn that love might hit you at the very moment, you thought you were full of it and it might not always be the first boy that a lady come across that will make them feel that way.

Later, Trudi meets a man and falls in love. She eventually falls pregnant but the man in question disappeared soon after that. And the two girls father (A STILL REALLY AMAZING JAMES BROLIN) reappears out of nowhere, offering Shade a ride home after she fled from a strange night out.

Directed by ALLISON LANDERS and landing FAIRUZA BALK the award for independant's best lead actress on its year of release, GAS FOOD LODGING has a whole lot to be acclaimed for. So my deepest congratulations to the whole talented team of workers on this one. This is a nice, touching little tale about coming of age in a small town in which everyone would feel the need to escape to find some freedom and fresh air. A little piece of art about caring for one an other. And this gorgeous little movie still touches me today.

494219,5,6302690420,"I don't remember how I came across this movie but it is wonderful.  Please don't think this is a chick flick in the way Julia Roberts/Meg Ryan/et have done.  Its a beautifully shot movie about women, but there isn't an easy solution in here.  Just like life you have little beautiful moment mixed in with some depressing real life situations that the characters have to go through.  I don't know why the movie didn't catch on as it should have, just for the visuals alone the movie gets high marks.",1356566400,3,498,4.5
494260,5,6302690420,"This movie reminded me of those drive-in classics I used to see just when I was old enough to drive and hear curse words in a movie. The story here is about a woman and her two teenage daughters living in trailer along the freeway, henceforth the title. They argue and fight a lot and say f... a lot but always seem to end up sort of stuck with each other. I agree with most of the other reviews here...you can almost feel the dirt road under the wheels of you tires or the screen door slamming and people yelling and cursing each other.
The younger characters herein sound like they're at about the same age except I was that age about 15 years before this was made. The idea of being stuck in a small town, bored to death and convinced that no matter what you'll still be there tomorrow.
Pretty raw dialogue in lots of places. No cinderella, fairy tales or teen comedies here either. I want to warn those who look for any of those that it ain't here.
The movie takes place in Mew Mexico and has some racial overtones to it as well. The reason that I've mentioned that is that I felt like I'd seen something similar to it with but set in another state and also in case my title might mislead someone into thinking that this is some redneck movie about growing up in the south but it ain't that either. This is also not really a chick movie in the sense that I've always understoood the term.
The characters both males and females are pretty raw and uncultured and unrefined and again seems to avoid the ususal movie cliches that I think I've covered in full above. No teen comedy, redneck comedy, soap opera, or love story here.
I could actually live without hearing an actual argument over who took the last tampon. That seems to be what everybody herein does real well is to argue about mom working at the diner to the neighbor installing his satellite dish to the idiot at the movies who can't focus the projector or the guy that's heard bout the girl who likes to swallow. (It isn't porn either) Argue and fight and then life goes on. No one ever seems to apologize to each other but no one seems to care.
If you grew up under these circumstances you may not be shocked at the language but I felt that for some who were expecting something lighter to be forewarned. Most of us from small towns pretended to be shocked in front of our parents but in reality we hear thesame language everyday.
Fairuza Balk's narration makes it somewhat more interesting as she seems to be trying to find a new husband for her mother whose first one vanished or something and she's dated a bunch of losers so her daughter figures that finding mom a new husband will free them all of their restrictions.
I passed through New Mexico once in lifetime and as well as I remember it looked a lot ilke this movie. I give credit for avoiding all the usual movie cliches that I could think of anyway. This is slow moving, dirt roads, pick up trucks, trailer parks and truckstops. I like the realism of it and It seems to accurately capture the feeling of frustration of being trapped in a hick town in the middle of nowhere, the only way out if you're a woman is to get married and hope to escape. It's that this sort of doesn't always happen in reality either which is another point that this movie makes real well. Life is unfair.
It's definitely not something I want to sit through everyday of the week. But once in a while, I could see myself watching this just for the hell of it.",1295481600,,3462,4.327692307692308
494261,4,6302690420,"A simple slice of life - a mother and her two daughters surviving life in a
desert trailer park.

I found I liked this much better on 2nd viewing, prepared for its low-key
gentle pace.

Some really touching moments, and the relationships have a sense of real-life
complexity.  On the other hand the acting is a mixed bag, and a few plot twists feels
forced.  Still, a good, bittersweet movie about life on the fringe of society.",1286064000,,428,4.51948051948052

494263,4,6302690420,"My initial impression of ""Gas Food Lodging"", midway through the film, was that it didn't have much to say to me.  I saw a younger teenage daughter in a broken home, a nice well-meaning mother who is exasperated with the older teenage daughter, the older daughter who seems destined for trouble, and some supporting cast that lead me to wonder what was in the town's water.  Things happen and more scenes of disfunction appear.  I began to see that some things were connecting while others were falling apart.  Still no redeeming message until the very end.  At that point all that had happened came together in a most beautiful yet poignant way.  The message was delivered and the film, from my perspective, was endowed with purpose.

The next day I thought more and more about ""Gas Food Lodging"".  I understood it as a ""coming of age"" story of a teenage girl.  She saw the redeption of everything in her life coming in the form of expected love.  However, every expression or exanple of love that she witnessed was broken or never real in the first place.  Things kept descending along with her faith that all would be well if everyone could just let it happen.  Her search to find the answers failed until the answers found her.

Once the impact of the movie finally sunk in, I was reminded of ""The Last Picture Show"" of 20-some years earlier.  In that book and movie we saw a teenage boy realizing his coming of age in a small Texas town in the middle of nowhere.  Sonny also had trouble finding structure as everything around him seemed to fall apart.  His outcome was not as reassuring as our young heroine's but it, too, ended with hope emerging from tragedy.  Being a teenager is no easy task especially when there is a lack of good role models.  It's easy to get lost, misguided, or trapped in solitary confinement.  ""Gas Food Lodging"" leads us in all those directions and then shows us a future of hope.  Nicely done.",1246060800,,1926,4.559766763848397
494264,4,6302690420,"Gas Food Lodging (Allison Anders, 1992)

I'm easy, I admit it. I'll watch any movie in which Ione Skye appears topless. Lovely woman, she is. Of course, the movie being directed by Allison Anders helps. Lovely movies, she makes.

This one concerns a mother (Brooke Adams) raising her two children, the wild older one (Skye) and the bookish younger one (Fairuza Balk) in a little town in the desert. There's young love, there's heartbreak, there's weird, malformed prejudice and hints of magic. Then their father (James Brolin) comes back into the picture, and everyone's world gets turned upside down.

Anders has a reputation for making deeply personal, quirky films (Things Behind the Sun, Grace of My Heart, etc.), and Gas Food Lodging is no different. It rambles, basically plotless for much of its length, around these three characters, their friends and adversaries. If you like your films with a good, solid plot, this one's not for you. But Anders has a certain magic touch that seems to work well with the slice-of-life films she so often helms; she is capable of crafting characters the viewer can identify with and care about, and that makes all the difference. I liked this movie a great deal, perhaps more than any of Anders' other movies I've seen, and I definitely recommend it. *** ",1223596800,2,1298,4.886363636363637
494265,5,6302690420,"This is a fantastic film.  For anyone who is a fan of Ione Skye or Fairuza Balk, it's definitely a must-own flick!  Both ladies are in their prime here.  I originally saw the movie only because of J Mascis' involvement musically (and a small cameo) but I've fallen in love with the movie as well as the young adult novel it was based on, 'Don't Look and it Won't Hurt' by Richard Peck.",1179964800,2,385,4.2465753424657535

Trudi looks for a reason to survive in the desert of her hometown and her life and tries to find it in boys. Shade is looking for a movie-like love, and tries to find it in the screen and in her plans to reconstruct her family.

494267,4,6302690420,"So, I just watched Gas Food Lodging for the first time. Wow!

First of all, any movie that has narrative voice over always makes me smile. I don't know exactly why, they just do. I think because it gives far mor insight as to what's happening.

These three women living on the outskirts of a dying town smacked of ""The last picture show"". Life has dealt each a pretty hard hand and it's hard to tell if Mom Nora, older sister Trudi, or young Shady Lynne has it the worst. Nora's found love where she could and it's burnt her every time and that's been passed right on down to her two daughters.

They've no faith that it will ever change, yet they continue to try to find love anyway. Quietly surprising and very entertaining, I would say to run out and pick this up today.",1144195200,7,773,4.280821917808219
494268,5,6302690420,"This movie takes place in the 1990's in a dessert town of Laramie, New Mexico.  Nora (Brook Adams), is a single mother raising her two daughters the best that she can.  She is a waitress at a gas stop/restaurant.  Her oldest daughter is Trudi (Ione Skye), who is know around the town as being easy, and ends up pregnant by a Dink, who is a English man, whose job is to look for rare rocks.  She gives her mom a hard time, she  stays out late at night, and is not going to school.  The youngest daughter is Shade (Fairuza Balk), she is considered the ""good girl"" of the two.  She loves to go see movies that star Elvia Rivero.  Shade or Shad, wants to be like a ""normal"" family.  She wants to have a father figure, so she looks for a man for her mother. Each one of these characters are looking for love, and this movie not only shows the hard ship of life of each one of them, but also shows their search for love.

  On a scale of one to five, I give this movie a five.  I really do like this movie.  This drama keeps you entertained through the whole movie.  I was hoping that for each of them that they would find their true love, and  for them to live ""happily ever after.""

I saw it as a teenager, with my parents, and the next time my mother and I had a fight, it ended when we realized how much we sounded like the characters in this movie and both just started laughing. Gas Food Lodging features the best performances I have ever seen by both Ione Skye (who was also great in Say Anything) and Fairuza Balk, who shows a much greater acting range here than you might suspect if you had only seen her in more recent movies like ""The Craft"" and ""The Island of Dr. Moreau."" Almost every single character in this movie is fully realized and well acted, and the story successfully negotiates a wide range of emotions, from the joy of falling in love to feelings of exclusion and loss.  Although this story could have come out feeling sad or depressing, I don't think it does; rather, it's bittersweet and all the more memorable for facing up to difficult things.",976492800,7,952,4.44
