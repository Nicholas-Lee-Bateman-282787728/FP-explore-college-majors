6780746,4,B00P0DMYWY,"I have been waiting for a long time to see this, so happy it came to Amazon. It's a great story and the acting is superb. I love independent films, there is such substance to the story and they rarely ever disappoint.",1418601600,10,217,4.190476190476191
6780747,5,B00P0DMYWY,"This movie is odd in the fact that I didn't quite understand all of it (some of it is a bit dreamy, not only because of dream sequences, but spaced out like a weird dream, too), yet I can't escape the feeling that I just watched something truly wonderful.  I have James Welch's book of the same name but haven't read it yet.  Now that I've seen the movie and it's fresh in my mind, I intend to read it sooner than later, and hope that the book gives me added insight into what I just watched.  As a side note, aspects of this movie reminded me of The Big Lebowski.  One more thing: A.V. Club has a review of this movie which ends with this: ""Cursed with a vague, rambling script and an equally indistinct lead performance, the film is a scattershot series of vignettes about self-definition that, ultimately, never coheres into a lucid whole.""  Disregarding the comment about the lead actor (Chaske Spencer) who was brilliant and believable, the comment is mostly true, but at the same time doesn't really do the film justice.  It feels that way, yet there is something else going on here, too.  Bottom line: This film requires some work from the viewer.  Will definitely watch again.",1477267200,2,1184,4.525821596244131
6780748,5,B00P0DMYWY,"This is a slow and seemingly simple plot, but as the layers unfold the complexity of this character and the challenges faced become real. This is about a man dealing with struggles of the now, but the past is omnipresent, and the ability to merge these timelines together was executed well by the screenplay and cinematography of this film. Oddly enough, this movie left me with a desire to become a rancher on the high plains - even though this was not a central plot to the film. The landscapes and the lighting were amazing and brought me directly into the place.
-Daniel J. Rice, author of THIS SIDE OF A WILDERNESS, and THE UNPEOPLED SEASON",1475107200,,645,4.568965517241379
6780749,5,B00P0DMYWY,This is a superb movie in every way. It slowly builds its story and by its end feels like warm soup on a cold winter day. Excellent!,1469750400,,132,3.925925925925926
6780750,5,B00P0DMYWY,This was a great film. Chaske Spencer gave a brilliant performance.,1452297600,,67,5.181818181818182
6780751,5,B00P0DMYWY,"Read the book first. The movie and the book are a little depressing. The main character looked and ""felt"" like the character from the novel. I think it may have been less interesting and more confusing had I not read the book. However, some things were expressed more clearly in the movie.",1452297600,2,289,4.576923076923077
6780752,5,B00P0DMYWY,"Now, a favorite.  A movie that is more meaningful and powerful with repeated viewings.",1447632000,,86,5.142857142857143
6780753,5,B00P0DMYWY,great film. A must see!,1439683200,,23,3.8
6780754,4,B00P0DMYWY,Well made.  Not so heavy handed in the message.  Folds back on itself a bit but a good pay off.,1439337600,,95,3.7
6780755,5,B00P0DMYWY,"Loved this movie, first of all Chaske Spencer gave a great performance and the movie was well written, loved the music as well.",1439078400,,127,4.565217391304348
6780756,5,B00P0DMYWY,"Love this film! I've read the book a few times now because I was so intrigued by the adapation. It's hard to imagine that something as introverted and nuanced as James Welch's classic could possibly be recreated in this medium, which makes it all the more impressive. The filmmakers managed to bring the full essence of the novel and its mentally fragmented narrator to the screen while still putting their own unique spin on the story. The visual poetry of the film is beautifully engaging, giving a strong sense of geographical place as well as the protagonist's mental space. This, along with its thoughtfulness and some pretty hilarious moments, all coalesce into a stunning cinematic experience.",1437696000,6,700,5.043103448275862
6780757,5,B00P0DMYWY,Just had to have this DVD that was shot in the local area of nowhere Montana (Chinook area).  I really liked it biased or not.,1435968000,,126,4.04
6780758,4,B00P0DMYWY,This is a compelling narrative from up and coming filmmakers. It is well acted in almost every sense and represents the pathos and despair of not only American Indians but young people alike that cannot come to grips with life changing situations.  I like it. You may get discouraged with the number of flashbacks but stay with it as it is worth it.,1432857600,4,349,4.5396825396825395
6780759,5,B00P0DMYWY,Chaske Spencer acting is superb.,1429056000,,32,5.6
6780760,5,B00P0DMYWY,"Use of actual north-central Montana landscape as a ""character"" helps directors do justice to James Welch's fabulous novel. Casting is brilliant and acting is superb.",1428019200,,165,5.64
6780761,5,B00P0DMYWY,A very interesting film that leaves you guessing until the end. What really happened? Why does the main character have these flashbacks to this incident? The reveal is surprising and not expected. Very well-done film.,1427155200,2,217,5.228571428571429
6780762,5,B00P0DMYWY,"Wonderful moving story which Native Americans can easily relate to.  This was the second time but not the last I read this book.  Also got the DVD, same name as the book, and it closely follows the book.  My daughter borrowed the book and DVD which I am patiently awaiting the return!!!",1425340800,2,286,4.461538461538462
6780763,5,B00P0DMYWY,This movie was filmed where I live.  I saw it first at the local theatre and wanted a copy.  Thankyou for making it available.,1425168000,,126,4.208333333333333

6780765,5,B00P0DMYWY,"My son appears briefly in this movie. It is based near our home and we can identify with the story told here. I will enjoy watching it over and over, as I had read the book - years ago.",1424649600,,185,3.769230769230769
6780766,5,B00P0DMYWY,This story was born and bred in Montana!  Hooray for Montana!,1424649600,,61,4.545454545454546
6780767,4,B00P0DMYWY,"A good, true adaptation of a great book. Recommend reading the book before the movie since it helps you understand the whole thing.",1423958400,,131,4.739130434782608
6780768,4,B00P0DMYWY,"The movie was slightly hard to follow. It was artsy. Now there is nothing wrong with artsy at all. I just was not prepared to have to focus and think as hard as I had to, too watch the film. Chaske made this film truly shine. His acting in it was way above par. I had no idea that he had such a range. I was truly impressed with his skills.",1423699200,,340,3.8028169014084505
6780769,5,B00P0DMYWY,Chaske Spencer gives a great performance as someone who is haunted by past events.,1421712000,4,82,4.928571428571429

6780772,4,B00P0DMYWY,"Complicated enough to be interesting, this movie probes the contemporary Native American experience of one man. A psychological exploration of trauma, with some sweetness along with the pain. Worth watching.",1419552000,6,207,5.933333333333334
6780773,4,B00P0DMYWY,great performances. great story.,1419379200,,32,7.25
6780774,5,B00P0DMYWY,An excellent adaption of the book.  The Smith brothers brought James Welch novel to the screen with thoughtfulness and integrity.  There is the element of this story that presents life on a reservation as it is; the slow tedious pace of day to day; of eking out an existence through the struggle to survive.  The importance of knowing your own history so that it can be claimed as your own is a part of this well written and well acted script.  Kudos to all who were involved in this project.,1419120000,11,492,4.433333333333334
6780775,5,B00P0DMYWY,Wonderful book. True to life. James Welch was our brother. We are so proud of him. Always.,1419120000,18,90,4.352941176470588

8685985,4,B00P0DMYWY,Hardcore pain and hardship. The true life of what a lot of native people in the land endure because of the many things endured over the centuries.  Tough movie but true to point. This native actor does this movie Justice.,1531440000,,221,4.525
