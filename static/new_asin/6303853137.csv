7853444,5,6303853137,"I really love this exercise session.  It's not too hard for beginners, but offers lots of ways to make it tougher as you improve in your fitness level.  I would highly recommend using this one on a regular basis.  It just makes you feel good after it's over!",1228262400,,258,4.333333333333333
7853445,5,6303853137,"I keep several exercise videos on hand for variety, and I really like this one.  The leader is pleasant without seeming canned.  She encourages participants to take it as easy as they need to, so beginners can build up to her level.  Pushups can be done on the floor if the chair seems awkward, as it does to me.",1181433600,,312,4.254237288135593
7853446,3,6303853137,"The video is properly titled as a stretching video. The focus is on the legs, buttocks, and hips. There are 3 women on the video each with a strong chair that certainly must be be glued to the floor because they don't budge. One will need a strong support to complete the exercises in the video whether it is a stable chair or something else. The exercises are reasonable and challenging and the exercise leader is quick to tell the participant to modify the exercise or do only as many as she can. The music is light and in the background which is good. The only thing that bothered me was the women really have an eighties look to them in their dress and in their hairstyles but, I suppose that shouldn't detract from the exercises.",1151625600,3,734,4.404411764705882
7853447,3,6303853137,Overall I would give this video a C-. First of all you need a chair for this workout (a good sturdy chair) and secondly the instructor is no Denise Austin (whom I find to be better than this instructor). The first part of the video is a warm up and the instructor assumes you know what you are doing. This video is broken down into four parts of stretching. If you are a beginner or a new comer to working out then stay away from this video. If you are an intermediate or advance then this video is for you.,1135296000,2,507,4.08
