8367855,1,B002EOVXDS,"I got a free copy of this DVD when it first came out. I hated it then, but watched it again just now to give it another chance. Yup, still dreadfully dull and pretentious.

In the ""bonus"" features, director Dylan Bank is just so cocky, and self-important, and full-of-himself -- this lack of self-awareness reveals why he was able to make such a BORING mess while imagining that he'd created horror greatness.

Bank tells us he's been a ""hardcore horror fan"" since childhood, etc., and that people mistakenly assume that horror is low-brow, but that he believes that horror fans are the most ""sophisticated"" of film fans. Apparently, he believes his NIGHTMARE is ""sophisticated"" horror.

In reality, this film is a BORING piece of NON-horror crap. There's NO cohesion to any story, just streams of consciousness -- hence the title, NIGHTMARE. In Bank's film, a film student awakens with an actress to find a tape of them killing people, yet they don't remember doing it, and there's no blood.

That's a decent premise for a suspense story, but Bank immediately drops it. Instead, his film student protagonist starts to make a student film about this recent incident. He continues shooting new scenes as he finds new tapes of him killing people. Soon he's no longer discovering tapes of himself killing -- he's waking up finding himself actually killing people. Or not.

Things keeps happening -- he kills his girlfriend, no she's alive, he's in jail, no he's not in jail, he was mutilated, no he's not mutilated. etc. Films within films, nightmares, what's real, what isn't...?

NIGHTMARE meanders from tangent to tangent. Of course, the other film students complain of this film within a film, within a film, meandering from tangent to tangent. Yes, NIGHTMARE is an extremely SELF-AWARE film, its characters incessantly commenting on the film within a film, and by proxy, on Bank's film about the film student making a film about a film student making a film...

Hey Bank, here's a tip -- JUST BECAUSE A FILM IS SELF-AWARE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT'S SOPHISTICATED.

NIGHTMARES is neither ""sophisticated"" nor a ""horror"" film, as Bank smugly imagines. It's BORING. There's nothing ""sophisticated"" about a lack of story cohesion, or it all being a dream, or maybe not... (Of course, the protagonist's fellow film students tell him, ""This better not all be a dream"" -- Ha, ha, how SELF-AWARE and post-modern and ""sophisticated!"")

A BORING mess.

With NIGHTMARE, Bank proves to be a ""hardcore horror fan"" who knows NOTHING about how to make an entertaining, much less artistic, horror film.

Look, I love horror-art films.

8367856,3,B002EOVXDS,"It certainly appears that the film makers simply wanted to make a film that would never lead to a completely rational plot - and then have the audacity to add a ""director's discussion"" on the DVD to trash well-plotted films (don't spoon feed the audience) and finally to blame the audience itself for the gore and gratuitous nudity and bloodshed.
Hey, I love nudity and bloodshed.  But I do not like movies such as this that imply grand thought when the fiim on its whole really does not fully understand itself.  You know, let's screw with the audience and then blame them for not fully comprehending the film.  Doesn't work this time, fellas.  You made a fun film to watch - but certainly not anything worth thinking about.  I wonder if you guys have fully understood what you thought you were filming.
So, I give this 5 stars for the nudity, really only 3 for the not quite so realistic blood and guts, and 1 for trying to make yourselves seem brighter than your audiences.  2 1/2 stars should do it.",1328227200,2,1003,4.513812154696133
8367857,4,B002EOVXDS,"Tops coherent horror films.

I am the fourth reviewer and not a hard core horror movie fan. But I agree with the two positive reviewers and what they have to say and have little to add. I found it very entertaining even though it was clearly a teaser of the dream within a dream, psychotic fantasy blurring into reality sort. The acting was engaging and the play on film school pretensions and such helped hold it together for me. I liked it much better than most horror films that are coherent.

I guess there could be several ways to think about what is going on. The film school budding director was into improvisation filming. As I saw it he was probably fantasizing about where his film might go next and we were seeing convincing realities that were often but not always his imagination. Then the question for me was if he was nuts and his nightmares were spilling over into his waking state, or what? This was my mind's effort to impose probably too much order on a film that was meant more to tease than get wrapped up logically. Take it or leave it. Well, it did tease in any event.

I suspect this film would go well with not only some types of hard core horror fans, but some viewers who are deeply into the culture of aspiring film makers.",1326326400,,1251,4.383620689655173
8367858,1,B002EOVXDS,"This is, hands down, the worst thing I have ever seen.  Made on Friday afternoon with a budget of $12.50 it was a wast of film and time. I put it in the trash can and pretended that I never bought it. Don't bother, just don't.",1275436800,,226,3.9130434782608696
8367859,4,B002EOVXDS,"Nightmare is a low budget slasher in a surreal style guaranteed to separate the somewhat interested viewer from the fully committed horror fan. With blood, nudity, a slew of irritating minor characters and graphic sex galore, at first the film appears to be a self-indulgent exercise. Also, it's clear from the start that the sex scenes are not meant to be all that sexy, and some of the horror isn't meant to be scary. So, what gives?

Directed by Dylan Bank in 2005 and now available on DVD, Nightmare redeems itself with a premise that keeps paying off and solid, compelling performances by lead actors Jason Scott Campbell and Nicole Roderick and supporting actor Amin Joseph. By the midpoint viewers will either tune out altogether or become obsessed with figuring out what lies behind the core mystery.

I love a mystery, so I kept coming back for more and I'm glad I did. The conclusion to the story is not what I anticipated, but it is satisfying for anyone who likes both horror and meta-horror.

A self-confident film student goes to a party where he is praised by unctuous friends and envious classmates. He meets an interesting young actress, and they have a one-night stand. When they wake the next morning, they discover a video camera is pointed at the bed. The tape in the camera contains what looks like a snuff film--starring the couple as vicious killers, slaughtering several naked victims. All of the action appears to have been shot in the room where they made love and then slept, yet the tape is the only evidence that the event took place.

Emotionally shaken and still a bit hung-over, the director and the actress try to figure out what has happened to them. Are they the victims of a practical joke? If so, who is behind it? Have they been drugged and used, or is someone simply playing mind games with them? Are they performing the acts on tape or have they been portrayed by doubles?

Their fear spikes when the same thing occurs on the following night. In their confusion, the two form a bond that might have been less likely under normal circumstances. They decide to make sense of their nightmare in the only way they know how: by making a film about it.

Bank and co-writer Morgan Pehme know what they are doing, and why. Their film pokes fun at the reverent study of cinema, while reveling in the horror genre instead of apologizing for it. I would be excited to see these artists operating on a bigger scale with a more generous budget. As it is, they have created a film with a nifty hook, good timing, a sense of humor--and what I think is an ending worth waiting for.",1257897600,5,2606,4.593548387096774
8367860,5,B002EOVXDS,"I hadn't heard of this movie before I saw it among the new releases in Amazon's horror bin. It saw that it had interesting reviews, so I decided to give it a chance and am I ever happy that I did.

This movie is twisted, surreal, and full of violence and nudity. At times, it is also confusing and frustrating. But after watching the director's commentary, I see that's exactly what the filmmakers were going for.

This movie grabs you in an unexpected way and takes you on a journey through madness, courtesy of striking performances by the film's lead actors - all unknowns, as far as I could tell. The best part of this movie is that it defies your expectations and never lets you predict what's coming next. As a hardcore horror fan who always sees the big twist coming from a mile away, I was relieved to actually be surprised for a change.

I haven't been this disturbed and unnerved by a movie since ""Irreversible"". I hope this obscure indie film gets its due. It might be too raw for the mainstream, but it's a gem for horror heads looking for something bloody and provocative to sink their teeth into.",1254268800,7,1110,4.458128078817734
