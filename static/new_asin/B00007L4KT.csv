1819200,2,B00007L4KT,"I'm an Elijah fan, so I went out and rented this movie as soon as I found out about it.  The plot is pretty interesting, but is drowned out by the movie's overabundant shots of Edward Burns walking dramatically down the street to the movie's redundant soundtrack.  I must admit that Burns does a pretty convincing job in his character, although I'm not really sure if that is attributed to his acting or because he may actually be like that, since the last Burns movie I saw was ages ago.  Rosario Dawson gives a pretty good performance in this movie, as does Elijah Wood.  The only complaint I have about Elijah's performance is that he lacks the tough New York accent that Burns (who plays his brother) has throughout the movie.  I'm not sure that if they grew up together, why Burns' character has an accent and Wood's does not.  Oh well.",1073347200,,841,4.5
1819201,4,B00007L4KT,"This movie isn't bursting with action, but after it's all through, you realize action is a part of it.  The beginning of the film is kind of slow, but I think the speed fits in well with the rest of the story.  The music in the movie, which is a beautiful piano track, is another factor in this movie doesn't make it feel like an action movie. It does, however, project just the right feeling.  One of my favorite aspects of this movie is a chase scene in which the only sounds you can hear are the characters breathing and their thudding footsteps.  This appealed to me because during the scene you realize that this chase is happening in a normal neighborhood, and gives you a surreal, sort of disturbed feeling. This made the scene much more interesting than the typical loud, booming music of action scenes that most movies fall to.  Edward Burns does a convincing job of the turnaround criminal Francis.  Francis's want to change but his need to protect those he loves and cares for gives us a sense of a man who has resigned to live with what he's been given.  Elijah Wood is cast as Francis's brother Shawn, a young man in hiding who makes us realize that people can do anything out of love and fear for the people they care about.  Shawn is portrayed as a man who has done something he'll always regret, but knows that he can't let that get in the way of him living the life he once knew.  The only flaw with Shawn is that he seems somewhat naive to the danger that he is in.  This is somewhat understandable, what with his immense want to return to his previous life, but still makes you wonder why he's not taking the stituation a bit more seriously.  Rosario Dawson does a great job of conveying a confused, betrayed woman who's trying to figure out whether or not the right decision is the one she should choose.  Overall, the performances by the entire cast fit in seamlessly with the movie's mood and theme.  The ending of the movie gives a basic resoultion, but raises questions about what happens to the characters and what the characters' reactions would be.  It also may raise questions about yourself.  Most of all, the movie teaches us that revenge can be a way of life, but it doesn't have to be.  It teaches us that whether or not the action is small or large, right or wrong, when it comes to our family, love is behind everything we do.",1071792000,,2360,4.403225806451613
1819202,5,B00007L4KT,"I loved this movie.  I picked it up after seeing Edward Burns on the cover, rather than Elijah Wood.  And the fact that Edward Burns directed intrigued me as well.  Plus with Rosario Dawson (one of my favorite actresses), it seemed like a can't-miss.
The movie itself was awesome.  A wonderful story.  It was a bit predictable at the end.  But surprising at the same time.  This film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  It was superb.",1065139200,,447,4.365853658536586
1819203,3,B00007L4KT,"Ash Wednesday is not a GREAT movie.  You should know that right off the bat.  It is not even a particularly GOOD movie.  So that's the bad news out of the way.
The good news is, it isn't bad either, in its own way.  It is extremely slow-paced at the beginning and quite repetitive, but the music and repetetiveness make it relaxing rather than boring; it becomes almost hypnotizing, at least if you're watching it late at night.
The movie is about a family entangled in a mess of murderous criminals, a boy (Elijah Wood) who killed three of these criminals years ago and paid for it with his life, and his older brother who starts to hear rumors that his late sibling has been seen around town.
It doesn't have a lot in the way of plot, but once it gets going, not even that slows down this movie; it has midnight chases, tense moments, gunshots, scared girlfriends and mysterious people in the corner enough for any better-planned action movie, and it more than makes up for spending the first half of the movie watching the older brother walk around and run into people on the street.
As I said at the beginning, this is not a great movie.  But it should certainly be credited with being, for want of a better word, resourceful: it has a second-rate, predictable plot and not much else, but it takes what it has and runs with it and the result is surprisingly entertaining.
(Also, fans of Elijah Wood, this will be a fun movie for you!)",1062979200,9,1438,4.431818181818182
1819204,5,B00007L4KT,"I rented this a while back, admitedly for Elijah Wood, but I've very glad that I did. It was surprisingly unpredictable...not to say it was entirely unpredictable...one can figure out the general ending, however there is a lot that happens before that ending making one wonder if that initial thought it right or not. Elijah Wood and Edward Burns are both fantastic, and they play off of each other so well one can believe they truly are brothers. There is a great deal of swearing, so if heavy language is offensive don't watch it...but if you don't mind the language, definitely check it out. And watch out for the last scene because it will catch you completely off guard and leave you with a satisfyingly disturbed feeling.",1057276800,4,727,4.732283464566929
1819205,4,B00007L4KT,"With a setting like ireland, and a genre like ""crime drama"" I was really interested in this movie. I liked it. I loved the way they tied in francis'(edward burns) faith along with his unforgivable past, to his love/ hate relationship with his brother sean(elijah wood). I thought the cast was perfect except for  the casting of grace(rosario dawson). she did ok but that was it, ok. Overall, the movie was awesome but the ending was to abrupt. they should have showed more of what happened to sean and grace and their kid after francis helped them escape. Im leaving a lot out on purpose. I still recomend you see it.",1055548800,,617,4.558558558558558
1819206,4,B00007L4KT,"Nicely turned crime drama concerning vendetta among the Hell's Kitchen Irish. Directed by Burns (who also handled the script, I believe), but by no means an ""actor's film"" as in Sean Penn's various follies. Burns has a good eye, an excellent sense of place, and a full understanding of the camera.
  Which is not to slight the acting. Burns himself is fine and understated in the lead, Elijah Wood (after a few false minutes) demonstrates that there is life after childhood, there's a surprisingly good turn by Malachy McCourt as a Mick crime lord, and Oliver Platt cements his status as evil heavyweight of the decade.
  I understand that Burns has a ""Long Island Trilogy"" already under his belt, which I intend to check out soonest. If this one's any indication, Burns is a man to watch.
  ...and a fine St. Paddy's Day to you all.",1047081600,,833,4.671232876712328
1819207,5,B00007L4KT,"This movie had a very interesting plot. Though they say the ""f"" word quite afew times, it doesn't take away from the action filled Plot. Also Elijah Wood is my favorite Actor, and I think he does a very good job in this movie.",1046044800,,226,4.159090909090909
1819208,4,B00007L4KT,"Edward Burns is obviously a talent to watch.  In ASH WEDNESDAY he explores the Irish men and women of Hell's Kitchen in a story about gangs and about familial devotion.  Burns casts himself as the lead - a once bad guy who changes his ways to protect his little brother from the revenge of a killing.  Displaying a keen knowledge of the interactions of the Irish families, interworkings with the Catholic Church, the seediness of Hell's Kitchen, Burns has gathered a fine cast which includes Elijah Wood, Oliver Platt, Malachy McCourt and an impressive group of lesser known actors to give a sense of realism to this sad story.  The lighting is creepily superb and the filming techniques are in keeping with the overall mood of the piece.  I take exception with the over-loud, boring/boorish piano music background which not only covers the spoken word at times, but is so consistently repetitive that it draws attention away from the story.  Still, the over all effect is one of a young man growing solidly into a director and actor of signifcance.",1045958400,12,1049,4.8
1819209,4,B00007L4KT,"Perhaps my opinion is biased because I am a huge Edward Burns fan but I truely enjoyed ""Ash Wednesday"". It's dark and haunting quality makes it very different from Burns earlier works. The music is great and the cast is phenomenal. I would have liked to see a more intimate relationship between Francis and little Sean and I am suprised that he neglected to address this since it could have been pivotal to the storyline. As screenwriter, director and the star of the film, it is his call as to which direction he takes with his characters. A good example of this is Claudia in ""No Looking Back"" and Francis in ""Ash Wednesday"" but it would be interesting to hear his take on where he chooses his characters to go, both emotionally and physically. ""Ash Wednesday"" will not leave you with that ""happily ever after"" feeling but I give it 4 stars and will be proud to add it to my growing collection of Edward Burn's work.",1045440000,6,918,4.502994011976048

Add to that a beginning that leave you confused as to what is going on and who are the names (in between the F words) they are.

1819232,5,B00007L4KT,"This movie has kept me awake for several nights now.  Its disturbing and taut nature, the very real language of the guys from that area, and the Greek tragedy set in a realistic ""modern"" (1980's) situation had me staying awake all night watching this film and identifying strongly with the characters, in spite of a drastically different background.  Since seeing this, it's been a struggle to distance myself.  I was strongly reminded of my fellow construction workers in NY a little over 20 years ago, to whom I was a ""little southern belle"" outsider while working as a geologist on a drill rig w/ working class guys of Irish descent (who viewed me as a sort of Martian who'd landed amongst them, but kindly treated me like a sister).  The macho but straight-talking guys I worked with sounded just like the characters in the movie, and for those w/ tender ears who objected to the ""f"" word so often, I have to say I didn't even notice it until I read the reviews.  I do sympathize a very wee bit with those with scorched ears - the culture shock I experienced 20 years ago was profound, when I found that the word was used as simply a spacer or to add very slight emphasis to what was said, as in ""Time for another f'ing auger."" or, ""Hey, you got a f'ing cigarette?"", with no malice or impatience intended.  Since I told the guys I worked with not to censor themselves on my account, I picked up the habit quickly myself for a time.  So just f'ing get over it.  This is a great movie!

The ashes on the forehead brought back memories of my Catholic school, when even a Prod like myself was encouraged to go to mass and be marked w/ the ashes, and we didn't wash them off all day long.  For the students, it was a contest to see whose would stay on the longest that day. It was a little bizarre to see the characters plan various grave mortal sins while still wearing the ashes, but the strong religious beliefs in the middle of a violent society made it perfectly understandably why the more sheltered brother would go straight to the priest for confession and not necessarily just for help.

BTW - I think the score adds tremendously to the heart-breaking feeling of imminent doom for the flawed characters you've come to like. It adds to the feeling that it's just a matter of which one will get hit and how. The score resembles Philip Glass' work somewhat in its repetition of a haunting theme with great effect.  The ending of the movie w/ a rough-edged version of ""Be Thou My Vision"", one of my favorite old (Irish) hymns of all time, was brilliant if you know the lyrics - e.g.,""...Be Thou my Battle Shield, Sword for the fight..."". Time-travel '80's pieces by Triumph, the Scorpions, and Lynyrd Skynyrd on the jukebox helped as well.  The themes of atonement, betrayal, loyalty, sacrifice, and fate are all interestingly and well-addressed in this film.",1223337600,,2863,4.525193798449612
1819233,2,B00007L4KT,"The first half of this movie, Ed Burns' character, has everyone asking him if his brother is alive, who was supposed to have been dead for 3 years, and he denies this. The second half everyone finds out his brother is alive and the mob is after him for killing 3 of their mob members. If you can get past the first half of the movie (had to skip a chapter or 2), it gets a little more interesting. All in all it moves at a snail's pace.",1155945600,2,436,3.965909090909091
1819234,2,B00007L4KT,"When I read the synopsis on hbo one night and saw that it would be on shortly, I was more than looking forward to seeing it. I'm a huge fan of good cinema and of everything Irish. Almost immediately into the film it was clear it was a let down. Two medicore performances from the main characters heavily contributed to this. Just not belivable. At some points I felt like I was watching a novice scene being played out in an acting school. Wood really stunk and was actually annoying, and Burn's nonchalant approach might have been to nonchalant. Lackluster performances aside I kinda liked the story Idea. I think the movie could have had some potential, given it was handed over to some writers/directors with a little more potential than Burns. The high point of the movie may be it's cinematogrophy. This one's worth skipping.",1126051200,4,830,4.691780821917808
1819235,5,B00007L4KT,"This is an extraordinary film, considering that it was shot in only 20 days for a cost of two and a half million.

Ed Burns is Francis Sullivan, the oldest son of a union boss, a former longshoreman, and a first-class killer. Elijah Wood is Sean Sullivan, Francis' younger brother, a killer by default. Sean is exiled to a place somewhere out of the neighborhood for his own good, but one day, he returns to Hell's Kitchen and the story begins. Without going into a plot synopsis (I'm not going to explain something you can see for yourself), I will say that the plot is character-driven, and that it unfolds in a very logical manner.

Rosario Dawson and Burns (as always) are enjoyable to watch. Elijah Wood is believable as Sean. The soundtrack is good, and so is the cinematography. As a director, Burns did a great job. The Director's commentary on the CD was extremely interesting and pointed out things about the production of the film that were less than obvious. As a comparison, 'Sleepers' was another film that dealt with some aspects of Hell's Kitchen, even though the story was vastly different. Even so, parts of 'Ash Wednesday' had the same sort of feel. Maybe it was the mindset.

However, I'm sure that this film will have a narrower demographic appeal than films like 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Wars', simply because of the religious, ethnic and class issues that define the structure of 'Ash Wednesday'. If your background is something other than Irish Catholic, you're not male, and you're not familiar with life in the big city, then you'll probably have to work at understanding the film's characters and the story itself.

The story is well thought out, but it obviously wasn't meant for the same audience that buys into Paris Hilton, the 'Atkins' diet, or enjoys watching 'reality' shows on television.  That alone is refreshing.  I hope that Edward Burns continues to make films as well-crafted as this one.",1118620800,9,1933,4.772455089820359
1819236,1,B00007L4KT,"The only good thing about this movie happens to be the score. But not even Elijah Wood could hope to salvage anything of this very boring, very irritating movie.

Let me just say that Edward Burns does not do a very good job in impressing anybody. It always seems as though the basic element of his films is swearing, swearing...and more swearing. So much in fact that it begins to grate on our already raw nerves, nerves that began to snap after the first ten minutes of this film.

Also, what brother would, or could do such an evil thing to his brother as to tell his 'supposed' widow her husband was cruelly murdered, and then sleep with her behind his very much alive brothers back. The complete lack of sympathy or compassion that Edward Burn portrays in this film and in Confidence makes one wonder what he's really trying to prove. Maybe that a dead pan face and even deader sense of acting really can make produce a movie.

Not even the music, which was rather creepy, could save this. Unless you absolutely must watch everything Elijah Wood has acted in, don't even rent this wooden piece of a film. Its just not worth the headache.",1114560000,4,1142,4.507246376811594
1819237,5,B00007L4KT,"Burns',as always, is great in ""Ash Wednesday. He captures the mood and essence of New York's ""Hells Kitchen"". The movie takes place in the 1980's and the music takes us back to that time. I am a native New Yorker and an avid fan of Ed Burns. Looking at his films always transports me back to NY, regardless of where I am.

If you love ""Ed Burns"", you will love ""Ash Wednesday""!

1819238,4,B00007L4KT,"An very good film, but not for everyone.  It has a slow and deliberate pace with very little action.  It's all about the story and the mood, not special effects.  The acting and casting was excellent, with the exception of Elijah Wood.  While he does a good job acting, I think he was miscast in his role. The musical score is fantastic as is the directing and cinematography. It all helps to set the mood.

The only place where Ash Wednesday falls short is in the lack of depth to the story. Burns did a good job with it, but would have been well advised to enlist the aid of a co-writer. I can't help but feel the story was lacking a certain ingredient that would have really brought it alive.

Ash Wednesday could have been a masterpiece but the storyline doesn't quite make it.

That said, Ash Wednesday is very good and I highly recommend it. Most films you pick will not be as good.",1102723200,2,888,4.313253012048193

1819240,4,B00007L4KT,"Yes, the plot moves pretty slow for the first half.  But overall, the movie is very good.  Burns does an excellent job of setting the tone cinematographically, using the grey chill of late-winter New York to give the viewer a sense of discomfort.

I think Burns did a great job of introducing very real characters, with the exception of Wood, who I agree is very much mis-cast in this movie.

The 'location' shooting gives the movie great realism, and (unlike some of the reviewers) I thought the 'piano solo' soundtrack was one of the best things about the movie.  The music very much fit into the mood Burns was trying to create.

I thought Burns did a wonderful job of portraying the urban ethnic religious society of Hell's Kitchen. In that regard, this movie reminded me very much of 'On the Waterfront'.  As a matter of fact, this movie could be described as 'On the Waterfront' meets 'Miller's Crossing'.

I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it takes quite a while before the movie 'gets going'.",1097712000,3,1021,4.602209944751381
1819241,3,B00007L4KT,"ASH WEDNESDAY is obviously Edward Burns personal paean to a lifestyle that has long since come and gone.  But there are so marveolous moments of moviemaking in this stiff, leisurely and ultimately unsatisfying film.

Opening on Ash Wednesday in 1980 and closing on the day after Ash Wednesday 1983, the movie paints a bleak and oppressive view of gangland violence; of family loyalties; of deception and love lost and regained.  It's interesting to see the Catholics with the ashen crosses on their foreheads, talking about offing someone or using the F word to the umpteenth level of tediousness.  Burns as a screenwriter should have known better to infuse such foul language throughout the whole movie.  I've always thought when the F word is used so much, the writer couldn't come up with anything really important to say. There's a lot of religious symbolism about mortality, repentance and forgiveness, too.

Another problem is that Burns didn't really give us a character to really care about.  Even though the tragic end is not pleasant, what else could there be?  Even in his heroic role, Burns is still a cold-blooded killer; his attempts at repentance don't really change him, and he commits the cardinal sin of sleeping with his brother's wife, knowing that his brother is really alive.

Burns does a good job in his role as Francis, a tormented young man who does his best to protect his brother and the brother's wife and son; no one even bothers to tell Sean that he has a son.

Elijah Wood tries hard, but he's horribly miscast.  He seems mature and adult when he shoots the three men who are planning to kill Francis, but when he comes back, he seems just like Frodo, all youthful innocence and his stupid act of going out for a drink only reinforces the lad's immaturity.

Rosario Dawson isn't given much of a role, but sadly doesn't do much with what she is given.

Oliver Platt infuses his usual disgusting villainy into a smaller role, but he pulls it off well.  James Handy as Father Mahoney also does a good job.

The photography is imaginative and the scenes of NY's Hell's Kitchen evoke a mood of gloom and hopelessness.

The musical score by David Shire is one of the most irritating scores I've had the displeasure to hear.  The redundant use of the same solo piano runs gets awfully tedious; they're used too much and tend to distract more than accent the scenes.

ASH WEDNESDAY is a movie that might have been better, but if this is what Burns wanted to convey, one can only hope he matures in his future endeavors.",1093046400,2,2543,4.6891891891891895
1819242,4,B00007L4KT,"This Edward Burns movie tries to investigate a subject that is close to its creator's heart - lives of Irish Catholic brothers in NYC.

This may cause a lot of people to see Burns as a one hit wonder, since his movies & characters do seem to have a lot in common - so much, in fact, that the stories themselves might not be the movies' main attraction for people who can't destinguish the smaller details between them.

Having said that on the story, the other aspects of the movie aren't that bad, actually. The acting seems genuine - including Elijah Wood (in his first post Frodo role) which has the innocent look to carry off his character. The mood & environment are very well established.

Edward Burns' commentary track may be of special interest to people who are interested in the making of indie / low budget films, even though I think this subject comes up in many of his commentaries.",1090713600,9,896,4.518518518518518
1819243,1,B00007L4KT,"With each passing movie, it becomes increasingly obvious Edward Burns was a one-hit wonder with ""The Brothers McMullen"".
In fact, it may be necessary to look at ""Brothers"" in a new light. What seemed fresh and talented storywriting then has devolved into tired cliches and really atrocious casting.
Elijah Wood is horrifically miscast in this movie. Are we truly to believe this timid kid could kill three assasins out to kill his brother?
It started off with ""She's the One"". Take a cab in New York City sometime and tell me how clean-cut Edward Burns looking cab drivers are driving around. It is so unrealistic that his character Mickey in that movie would drift into becoming a cabbie. It's almost as unrealistic as his Mike McGlone character not sleeping with Jennifer Aniston to be faithful to his girlfriend Cameron Diaz.
Then he made ""No Looking Back"" and wants us to believe that a woman as beautiful as Lauren Holly would end up working at a dead end diner in Far Rockaway.
This movie ""Ash Wednesday"" was a mess from start to finish. To reveal the storyline implausibilities would ruin the movie for anyone hellbent on wasting the money or time to rent this. If it's snowing or raining and you're trapped indoors I suppose you could waste the time seeing it on cable.
Not in a million years is a love relationship even feasible between Elijah Wood and Rosario Dawson.
Had Burns cast Stephen Dorff or Sean Patrick Flannery at least we could have watched the movie without a vomitous reaction to how horribly miscast Wood was.
Burns' smart-aleck dialogue has gotten very long in the tooth. A shame because I found ""The Brothers McMullen"" charming, sweet and virtuous. Despite all the beer product placement.",1086048000,4,1715,4.816949152542373
1819244,4,B00007L4KT,"It's gritty. It's dirty. It's violent and scary. It has little ash crosses on it. In a nutshell, it's Edward Burns' latest movie, ""Ash Wednesday,"" a surprisingly  poignant and thrilling action movie about two Irish-American brothers caught in a very dangerous position.  Though it's a little uneven, especially in the first half, the intensity makes it worth seeing.
The date is Ash Wednesday, 1980. The place: Hell's Kitchen. Sean Sullivan (Elijah Wood) is tending bar when he overhears three thugs plotting to kill his brother Francis (Edward Burns). So takes out a gun and kills all three of them to keep Francis alive. After that night, everyone hears that Sean is dead, and life continues for Francis and Sean's young wife (Rosario Dawson) for three years.
What no one knows is that Sean is really alive. And soon Francis begins to hear rumors that Sean has been seen hanging around the neighborhood. Little brother wants his wife back (unaware that he now has a baby son). Problem is, if he is still alive, then there are some scores yet to be settled. And Francis may have to pay the price to keep his family safe.
Revenge stories have been with us since... well, a very long time. And ""Ash Wednesday"" is noteworthy less for the complexity of its story (it really doesn't have any) than for HOW it's told. Family loyalty in movies is something that can rarely be done without sappiness, but amazingly Burns strips it down and makes it very moving. The first half is kind of slow, with a lot of Burns walking around and looking grim. But things pick up and compensate in the second half with more guns, dangerous strangers and family problems.
Burns' directorial style is as gritty and shadowy as the place he sets his film in; the brief twenty-day shooting schedule probably added to the feeling of urgency. Symbolism abounds in Burns' latest flick; for example the ash crosses, part of a Roman Catholic ritual right before Lent, serve as a reminder of mortality. During some of the most important (and potentially deadly) scenes, Burns and Wood have those marks on their foreheads. It's a nice extra dimension, considering that most action flicks don't have more than one or two levels on them.
Burns does an excellent job with a character who has a rather rotten past, and now has a need to protect the people he loves. Wood doesn't appear for much of the movie, but does an exceptional job when he does; his wide range is evident through the movie, whether he's cooing at his baby son or snarling as he guns down the thugs. Dawson doesn't really have a chance to do much, but is quite good with the confusion her character feels.
Burns' sharp-edged flick about choices and loyalty goes a bit deeper than your average revenge flick. Though flawed by an uneven pace and simple story, ""Ash Wednesday"" is well-acted and very compelling. Certainly worth a watch.",1076716800,17,2867,4.732
1819245,1,B00007L4KT,"As an Elijah Wood fan, I stupidly spent the money to buy the DVD ""Ash Wednesday"" thinking that if Elijah was in it, it would be worth spending the bucks to see more hours of 'that face' on my television screen.  Boy, was I wrong!  What an awful movie!  And frankly Elijah didn't do well in it because he didn't fit in! Surrounded by dirty, bitter, foul-mouthed losers, he could not quite find his niche.  Further more, the storyline is ridiculous. At times it seemed that dialogue was being invented...which actually would be an easy undertaking by depositing a particular four-lettered verb between each and every syllable.  If you like Elijah as I do, skip this movie.  Buy the much more superior ""All I Want"".",1076630400,2,712,4.656

I was aware of and had seen a few of Ed Burns' films too, so I wanted to see the mix.  I wasn't disappointed in either gentlemen, or in the film for that matter.  Burns captures a grittiness that I found somewhat refreshing, as this definately was a small budget film.  But big budgets don't always mean better films.  The acting was right on the mark.  I really liked the 'dark' aspects to the characters, the almost tin-type filming, not quite black and white, not quite color.  It added to the grit and tension.  The plot (yes, there was a somewhat typical plot about Hell's Kitchen and brotherly love, family devotion above all else, and you knew who would have to get killed pretty much right off the bat, you just held your breath until they fell) wasn't too convoluted to get lost.  Burns was excellent as the older brother trying to leave the past behind. All the side players were fine, too (though the Grace character was the leakest IMHO).  The first time you hear ""Frodo"" use the ""F"" word is startling (^_~) but then Elijah's acting talent comes through and he becomes part of the story.  It's good to see him tackling more adult roles.  I found him to be reasonably believable as a family member, he just didn't have the tough accent the rest of the characters did.  But he was the sheltered brother, he was the brother the family wanted to keep innocent, so it was perfectly acceptable to me that he came across the way he did.  But he had the same secret as the entire family, so looks are deceving.  Heck, even the family priest had a secret.  And the undercurrent of faith <hence the title> was very convincing (notice Burns'position at the end of the film).  The scenery, the music, the cast - it all worked in this film.  I recommend it.",1076284800,5,1855,4.4188790560471976
1819247,3,B00007L4KT,"""Ash Wednesday,"" actor-writer-director Edward Burns' attempt at an urban thriller, works beautifully as a mood piece but fails to be fully convincing as a crime drama. Set in the early 1980s in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen section, ""Ash Wednesday"" is about Francis Sullivan, a young Irish mobster trying to go straight, and what happens when his brother Sean--supposedly killed by rival thugs after whacking three of their crew--suddenly reappears after three years. Burns marinates us in the color and flavor of the gritty neighborhood--the photography, a palette of browns and grays, sets an intriguing tone, and David Shire's moody, jazzy piano score is a wow. But all the detail in the world can't hide the basic thinness of the story. We've seen variations on this story a thousand times before--from ""Public Enemy"" to ""Mean Streets""--and Burns has nothing new to add. The cast is great--besides Burns as Francis, you have Elijah Wood as Sean and Rosario Dawson, Malachy McCourt, Oliver Platt and others in supporting roles. But although the actors give their all, we never feel we have enough background about the characters for them to really come to life. And the ending, meant to be a shocker, merely seems gratuitous. In all, the best you can say about ""Ash Wednesday"" is that it's an interesting disappointment. (Another disappointment: I wanted to buy the soundtrack CD for ""Ash Wednesday,"" but discovered on this website that it contains NONE of Shire's outstanding music--only the songs on the jukebox in the characters' favorite hangout. If you want a collection of the greatest hits of Lynyrd Skynyrd, BTO, The Kinks, etc., this is probably a good buy, but if you want Shire's music, this is a REAL letdown.)",1074384000,,1722,5.066901408450704

7977893,3,B00007L4KT,"-Genesis 3:19  In a fictional early 1980s NYC's Hell's Kitchen, rumors start circulating that Francis Sullivan's (Burns) younger brother (Wood) has returned to the neighborhood. Problem is he's been presumed dead after gunning down a few local gangsters several years before, now the Irish Mob wants him really dead. This film, only released in two theaters and grossing less than $3,000 - really isn't too bad at all for the most part. It holds your attention and has a terrific 80s rock/metal soundtrack. Burns, Platt, Dawson and a few of the other actors are great. Wood is horrendously miscast, so is Malachy McCourt as Whitey the crime boss. But funny dialogue and good setting outweigh the at-times somewhat wobbly script and some poor casting choices.
