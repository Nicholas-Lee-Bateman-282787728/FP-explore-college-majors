8344872,4,B001URA64C,"This is a production at the turn of the century performed in Halle in a historical theatre with a minute capacity and wonderful historical environment. The sets are minimalist with luxurious period costumes that tops the field.
Trevor PInnock is a seasoned Handelian and wonderful musician. He conducts this production with great stylistic conviction and good dramatic thrust.
The singers are generally very fine, with a few standouts such as Thomas Randle's Bajazet and Anna Bonitatibus's Irene.
Randle, with a full tenor voice best suited to this role, sings in good baroque style, some thing the likes of Pacido Domingo cannot grasp despite armed with full and might vocal capacity. Bajazet is hardly a easy role, and on video at least, Randle's portrayal stands to be surpassed.
As the relatively minor role of Irene, mezzo-soprano Anna Bonitatibus was at the onset of an illustrious operatic career. Her singing is upstaging, with a luxuriant mezzo-soprano timbre, especially when the Asteria Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz is not fully comparable in terms of vocal colour, but she is dramatically capable nonetheless.
As the Greek general Adronicus, Australian countertenor Pushee is dramatically convincing and vocally capable, but the voice requires projection aid, as is the case with mezzo-soprano Monica Bocelli in the title role of Tamerlano.
It begs the question as to who are the singers using body-microphones, for in view of a small theatre as this one, I wonder the likes of Bonitatibus and Randle would require such, and similarly for the soprano role of Norberg-Schulz.
Whatever the reason for resorting to this, I do find some projection problem with Graham Pushee, while Monica Bacelli may have resorted to it for the sheer sake of making the role sound 'bigger'.
Tamerlano is certainly not an easy role to sing. Bacelli is passable, owning good technique and a good low register, but still barely adequate to carry forth the nastiness of this role. She is burdened by a weak dramatic portrayal, being slight of built and tender in years.
There is very few good recordings (let alone videos) of Handel's masterpiece Tamerlano. This one still ranks in front, with a younger Bacelli than the one more than a decade later in Liceu.
Well, it is high time that a new video of this be produced, especially when we have now a strong countertenor line up in the baroque operatic field.",1413763200,,2392,5.073604060913706
8344873,3,B001URA64C,"I second Bruno's review, particularly that Monica Bacelli's Tamerlano is the weakest link. However, credit for the sense of fragmented, disjointed, and ponderous drama is fairly evenly spread. Where, oh where are the Tamerlanos of yesteryear?",1393027200,,242,5.75
8344874,4,B001URA64C,"I have recently watched BOTH available ""Tamerlano"" dvd's, this one and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tamerlano/dp/B001RE9HH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tamerlano</a>.  This review will compare both videos, while containing a full review of this one.

First, the opera itself.  ""Tamerlano"" is one of a trio of ""heroic"" operas that Georg Handel wrote in the mid-1720's in London.  The others are ""Giulio Cesare"" and ""Rodelinda.""  All three are masterpieces and were successful at the time.  In recent years, as the Handel revival keeps getting more steam, they are staged more frequently- and available on dvd.

Tamerlano is the vindictive triumphant conqueror over the noble Bajazet in the 1400's (which is based on historical events).  Tamerlano seeks to marry Bajazet's beautiful daughter Asteria (who loves and is loved by King Andronicus of Greece- a supporter of Tamerlano).  Tamerlano is betrothed to Princess Irene (whom he has never met.)  Proud and heroic Bajazet strongly opposes Asteria's marriage to Tamerlano, and prefers a noble death for both of them, rather than bow down to the dictates ov the evil victor, Tamerlano.  During this dark drama, Asteria tries to kill Tamerlano twice.  In the end Bajazet, who has taken poison off-stage, has a significant death scene on-stage to foil Tamerlano's vengeance.  In the usual opera seria conclusion, Tamerlano agrees to marry Irene, let Asteria marry Andronicus, and the final chorus sings a happy end, even while the music itself sounds quite melancholy.

This death scene was quite revolutionary in Baroque opera (even though the actual death, in BOTH productions) occurs off-stage.  In fact, the whole ""tinta"" of the piece is quite dark and somber- making for a very effective drama.

Now for the video itself- This one is performed at the 50th anniversary of the Handel Festival in Halle, Germany in 2001.  The performance takes place in the tiny Goethe theater, which has a VERY small stage (with the visible footlights in front and in the wings).  The performance is with period instruments, led by Trevor Pinnock, a Baroque specialist, and is directed by the venerable Jonathan Miller.  There is a very minimal set- just a set of screens in the back in gold and black. (Since the entire opera takes place within Tamerlano's castle, this works quite well.)  The costumes are extremely colorful, and set in the Ottoman empire at that time.

As was usually the case in Handel's operas, two of the key roles (Tamerlano and Andronicus) were written for castratos- men with soprano voices.  Here, Tamerlano is sung by Monica Bacelli (who ALSO sings that role in the other dvd), and Andronicus is sung buy a counter-tenor, Graham Pushee.  (In the other production, the role is sung by a mezzo soprano).  Unusual for Baroque opera, the key role of Bajazet is a tenor role (hard to come by in the 1700's), here sung by Thomas Randle.  Asteria is performed by the gorgeous Elizabeth Norbert-Schultz.

The performances are all excellent and convincing to the drama.  Norbert-Schultz is quite moving as Asteria, with a beautiful voice, and Pushee is as well as Andronicus.  (I prefer a countertenor to a mezzo in the role, and he is just fine.)  In short, the actual performance is excellent and musically terrific.

Now for some technical matters.  The filming is fine, understanding that with such a small theater and stage, that the confinements does show a little on the video, like the front and side stage lights- but to no ill effects.  The sound is excellent- but no DTS system.  The English subtitles are all correct (no mis-spellings, etc), BUT they appear too often.  Every repeat has the subtitles below- which is unnecessary.  (To my mind, the best subtitles should be the least- while still translating all the words).

There are quite a few extras on the discs, which are a nice bonus.  There is a good documentary on the performance- mostly concentrating on the Handel festival itself, but with some illuminating remarks by Pinnock and Miller.  Also, there are numerous clips from the 50 year history of the festival, which is pretty cool.  One terrific bonus, is that you can display the score on the bottom of the screen, while the performance is playing!! Fascinating if you like that thing, and one that I have never seen on dvd before.

After much consideration between the two available dvd's, I think I prefer this one- with the VERY notable exception that Placido Domingo, who plays Bajazet in the Madrid performance, is terrific and not to be missed.",1332547200,5,4574,5.111859838274933
8344875,3,B001URA64C,"This performance has been available with a different cover for years; it's still available, with plenty of reviews, both positive and negative. I reviewed it myself in 2007; here's what I thought of it then:

""""Let's be clear; I love Handel operas; I have DVDs of every Handel opera available on Region 1. I worship Trevor Pinnock; he'd never disappointed me before. But... this performance is ponderous and unconvincing. Perhaps the lovely costumes so much praised by other reviewers inhibited the singers from adequate blocking and gesture. Monica Bacelli is the chief problem; she is completely unconvincing as Tamerlano, both as an actress and as a singer. She lacks all ferocity. I'm inclined to think that Pinnock's tempi are too ""judicious"" throughout, which also contributes to the ponderous air of the production. The superimposed score is absolutely worthless, unless you want to pause the opera dozens of times in order to read it clearly.
I will watch this disk again sometime. Perhaps I'll see or hear some redemption in it, but for the moment it's my least favorite Handel DVD except for the disastrous Ariodante.""""

I haven't changed my opinion. It's static and costume-heavy. And I like Monica Bacelli less and less the more I hear her. But the competition for ""worst Handel of the decade"" has gotten tighter, with a fairly unattractive production of Alcina also in the running.",1273795200,3,1394,5.056521739130435
8344876,5,B001URA64C,"This performance of Handel's TAMERLANO is brilliant.  The stage sets and costumes are gorgeous and colorful, and the singing majesterial.  All the singers were mature and capable, both in singing and acting their parts.  This is one of Handel's greatest compositions, until modern times quite neglected; Handel puts a great amount of feeling and emotion into the famous arias and duets.  There is considerable power in this music.  The formality of the Baroque style must not be allowed to dampen the listener's excitement.  This opera is a masterpiece. Relax and enjoy it.",1271980800,2,573,5.173913043478261
8344877,5,B001URA64C,"This wonderful production from the 2001 Handel Festival in Halle should serve as a model for anyone mounting or filming Handel's operas (or anyone else's operas, for that matter).

First, & most important, all the singers are superb, triumphing over Handel's extreme vocal demands, from long, sustained lines to brilliant coloratura runs.  I was especially impressed by the impeccable technique and interpretive artistry of counter-tenor Graham Pushee (Andronico) & the sumptuous sonority of mezzo Anna Bonitatibus (Irene).

Stage director Jonathan Miller has the singers always in character, acting & reacting expressively during their many long da capo arias, & the relatively few duets & ensemble scenes.  Trevor Pinnock & his original-instrument band, The English Concert, keep the music moving crisply along, but never rushed, & TV director Helga Dubnyicsek cleverly shifts camera angles & perspectives to create visual variety despite the static stage action (really, inaction) & the single, minimal set.  The simple backdrop of golden folding screens suffices to suggest palatial splendor without crowding the stage with any furniture other than a bench-like ""throne."" Finally, thanks & brava to Judy Levin, for dressing the singers in eye-holding, lavish costumes appropriate to the opera's oriental setting, a most welcome respite these days from the near-ubiquitous Eurotrash designers obsessed with making their productions look like anything but what the composer & librettist intended.

""Bonus"" features (quite superfluous, in my view) include a lengthy, not very illuminating, ""Making of Tamerlano"" documentary, extended (& rather pedestrian) musical excerpts from previous Handel Festivals in Halle, & interviews with many (mostly obscure) Festival participants.",1248652800,14,1777,5.841698841698841
