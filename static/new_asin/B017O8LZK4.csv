8739934,5,B017O8LZK4,"Excellent series about how to *not* do therapy.  Gabriel Byrne does an amazing job in his role.  Each season allows the viewers to follow a few (4-5) clients through their treatment plans, so its best to start each season at the beginning as the characters develop. Clips from episodes of this series have been used for continuing education classes in psych fields. Very helpful in identifying dual relationships that develop and other ethical issues in a therapeutic session.",1512000000,,476,5.089743589743589
