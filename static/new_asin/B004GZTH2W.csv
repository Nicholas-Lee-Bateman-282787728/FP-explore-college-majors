8429141,3,B004GZTH2W,"On leave from basic training, a young solider (William Eythe) brings his girlfriend (Anne Baxter) home to meet his parents (Ray Collins, Ruth Nelson). A few months later, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor and he's shipped off to the South Pacific. Based on a play by Maxwell Anderson (KEY LARGO), this is a rather odd duck among WWII Hollywood films in that there's a certain mysticism to it: the young soldier is able to communicate with his mother and girl through dreams. It plays rather mawkishly and I think we're supposed to be moved by it but it's all too pedestrian to be effective. There's a reason Maxwell Anderson's play are rarely revived these days. Directed by John M. Stahl who's done far better work (LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN, FOXES OF HARROW) but with material like this, there's not much one can do but plod away. With Vincent Price as a Shakespeare quoting Southern solider, Michael O'Shea, George Mathews, John Archer and Harry Morgan.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a nice B&W transfer with both English and Spanish language tracks as well as optional Spanish subtitles.",1358899200,,1081,4.780748663101604
8429142,5,B004GZTH2W,"This is in many ways similar to Bataan.  While Bataan showed the cooperation of various US and Filipino units in resisting the Japanese invasion this one concentrates on an artillery section holding out on a forgotten island outpost in the Philippines as the Japanese close in. Vincent Price is worth the price of the movie.  He gives a great performance as the unit' resident intellectual. At one point he muses ""how close to being horizontal does someone have to get to earn the right to be vertical"".  The troops all know help isn't on the way but they soldier on till the end.  They score a few small victories along the way.  This title isn't available in a US format.  I haven't seen it in years (decades)and would love to buy a copy. If you ever get the chance watch it.",1323734400,,777,4.475177304964539
