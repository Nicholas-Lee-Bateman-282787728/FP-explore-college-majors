2212105,4,B0007GP7GO,"First of all, I have to say that this was an enjoyable film. I think Schotten did a great job with what he had to work with. The couple of reviewers that blasted this film must not be TRUE zombie or Indie film fans. They review this movie as if they had just watched a multi-million dollar budget, major studio film with multiple film experienced big name actors. What they seem to forget is that this is the first film for all of the people involved in it. You have to start somewhere and I think this is a great start. Hopefuly Schotten's work will get the attention of second-terre producers and he will get a bigger budget for his next film and then again after that. He shows some promise in the genre and he at least had the nerve and the B@%LS to do this film. Don't forget that these people have regular day jobs just like you and me and do these films in their free time and with there OWN money. I don't see any of your films on Amazon for sale or on the racks of major rental chains!! These are people trying to fullfill there dreams of making it to hollywood and the big time. At least give them some respect for trying. Schotten is a purist and it shows in the film, such as him filming on film instead of digital. Do you people know what type of work and money goes into filming on film? He didn't take the easy and cheap way by filming on digital like everyone else is doing these days, he tried to stay traditional and you have to respect that. His love for the genre shows by the Romeroesque zombies. The make up has the feel of an early Savini or Argento film (do you reviewers even know who they are?) All I can say as a movie buff and a zombie buff is that this film is a great start for these guys, and most of all, I truly enjoyed it. If you are a fan of the high budget, major studio horror flick, then don't waste your time with this. But, if you are a fan of good low budget horror and enjoy seeing new promising talent and just enjoy a film for what it is, then this is a film for you.

To all involved in this movie, and especially William Schotten... Please do not let the negativity get to you, keep plugging away at it, live your dream and most of all, be PROUD of what you have accomplished!",1124841600,6,2222,4.0963302752293576
2212106,1,B0007GP7GO,"For years, I've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low-budget horror movies, but I'd rather watch ANYTHING shot on video than watching the waste of film that is Dead Life. Don't be fooled when I say this movie is shot on film. It SERIOUSLY looks like it was shot on a 1950s 8mm camera. It's perpetually grainy, dark, fuzzy, and shaky, and not in an artsy way. My $200 video camera looks infinitely better than this. The video quality is appropriate, however, as it's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this stink-fest. The sound is murky and undecipherable, the acting is strictly amateur hour, the characters are paper-thin with no distinction or purpose, the story is non-existent, the dialogue is a completely worthless bore, there's nothing remotely scary, and the special effects (including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a Commodore 64) are laughable. Or, at least, I wish they were laughable. That would've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this (high school) student film. It's movies like this -- cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy, but which get cherry spots on Blockbuster shelves because they're packaged with slick cover art -- that give horror movies in general (and zombie movies in particular) a bad name, and that make horror fans so wary. Disgraceful!",1116115200,5,1397,4.849372384937238
2212107,1,B0007GP7GO,"Let me start by saying that I love indipendent features and support them fully.

A movie like this threatens my support.

The actors ( I use that term loosly ) are just dreadful and don`t have any emotion. The "" dreadful sex scene "" is only dreadful in the fact that they wasted good film to shoot it. The SFX are passable and the story is just a retread. Do not waste your time with this.

I have to seriously question the reviewer that speaks so fondly for his love of zombie features. It reads exactly like the review that is quoted on the case.

If you want to see how good indipendent features can be purchase Van Bebbers The Manson Family or the upcoming Actress Apocolpse.",1115856000,2,679,4.322834645669292
2212108,4,B0007GP7GO,"This is not a great movie, but it's good.  It is particularly good considering the low budget.

I cannot help but compare it to MULVA:ZOMBIE ASS KICKER, which was a major disappointment.  DEAD LIFE is a good zombie movie, written and produced by people who respect their audience and love the genre.

These are Romero-esque zombies.  The plot doesn't offer many surprises, but the special effects are pretty good.

Check this one out.  It's worth it.",1115164800,3,450,4.842105263157895
2212109,4,B0007GP7GO,"In the end, the dead eat the living

A group of friends are trying to survive in the middle of a deadly virus outbreak. The virus revives the dead, and turns them into flesh eating zombies. Watch as Maxx and his friends fight hordes of freaky ass, hyper-twitchy, blue, Romero-esque zombies (think House on Haunted Hill twitchy). Watch Dead Life.

Let me start by getting it right out in the open that I absolutely loved this movie! Now mind you I am a card carrying, certified zombiephile, it's without question my favorite sub-genre in horror. I've been watching and enjoying zombie flicks pretty much since my inception into watching horror. The only person I know who could give me a run for my money is Horrorist, and even then, that's pushing it.

Dead Life's plot is a little clich, but it's pretty difficult to come up with a completely original idea as to why the dead are returning to life. In Dead Life, it's a disease engineered by the military for chemical weapon use, it gets spread when an infected zombies' blood goes into water, then flash to the city reservoir and bingo, the infection begins to take it's toll on society. We've seen it hundreds of times before. However clich it may be, director Schotten works some original angles into it by naming the virus (Necrotizing Faceitis M) and giving the virus a background by showing a news bulletin about the virus' supposed origins, use, and what the symptoms are supposed to be, all in great detail.

Schotten also did a great job with character development; you become sympathetic to some, and can't wait for others to be zombie chow. Of special note is the great gore EFX! Two bloody thumb stumps up!

Plenty of the aforementioned gore, violence, nudity (all of it disturbing, not exciting), and quite possibly one of the most terrifying and horrific sex scenes ever committed to film. Add to this already great formula a great metal soundtrack, and you've got a winner!

A few problems with the picture quality, but this flick was shot on film. Film doesn't lend itself well to amateur filmmaking because it shows every single imperfection in lighting, make up, you name it. There were a few minor focus problems here and there, but you know what, these guys made it work, and I gotta give credit to them for having the stones to shoot on film in the first place. Especially when everyone in indie horror is using video or digital video. Other than that, there were a few rough edits here and there, but nothing major.

Again, I COMPLETELY enjoyed this flick. William Schotten has raised the indie horror bar, big time!

I'm sorry.  I didn't like this film and I couldn't wait for it to end.  Actually, I forced myself to look at it.  Frankly, I don't know why I
purchased it because I don't like ""ZOMBIE"" films. In retrospect, it was probably the cover photo on the DVD that attracted my
attention; so, I purchased it to see what that guy was going to do.",1412121600,,352,4.132352941176471
8047471,2,B0007GP7GO,"The film itself is a decent little no budget zombie flick made by first timers.
It even has a really terrible scene of a man raping a zombie who then bites off  his offending member aka shlong. I can't fault them on any of this, it's the quality of the film or digital picture with it's terrible quality, it has blotches on it and defects and is very soft focus. If it  had been shot on anything other than a hand camera probably it would have been a three star NO BUDGETER.  It is the film that's the problem not the movie. BUt it's hard to get by the hand camera lack of clarity but as a little zombie flick the film is decent. THe makeup is very good too.",1307577600,,658,4.046153846153846
8047472,4,B0007GP7GO,"Released to mixed reviews, whether you enjoy Dead Life will really depend on whether you watch it as a movie made for 2004, or as a movie made as a homage to 1970s grindhouse features. Dead Life is dead-on in capturing the exploitation cinema of the 1970s, shot on super 8 and with an eye to grindhouse detail. Maxx and his friends are faced with a zombie apocalypse in their sleepy Ohio town. When the infection that creates the undead masses gets into the town's reservoir, the disease spreads rapidly, leaving them among a handful of survivors. What follows is a loose montage of surreal imagery, twitching, blood-spewing zombies, and plenty of graphic blood and gore, all set to an authentic-sounding punk rock soundtrack.",1300320000,,726,4.862903225806452
8047473,1,B0007GP7GO,"One never likes to really criticize a creative work because it is difficult to create a song, or movie or other creative object.

On the other hand it is easy to be a critic.

BUT sometimes something is so bad you feel obligated to warn people away.

This movie deserves such a warning.

It looks like the kind of movies we used to make with our home 8mm film cameras in the 70s just for fun.

Terrible film quality
Bad lighting
Bad sound
Bad script
Bad acting

It is like a group of friends got together one day with no advance planning and said ""lets just improvise on the spot and make a movie today.  We will make it up as we go along"".

Quite rarely do I take a gamble and buy a movie that I have not heard about beforehand....and im POSITIVE It will never happen again.

8047477,2,B0007GP7GO,"Okay I admit, they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends. Heres my problem, they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera, most of the scenes were blurry, every now and again the focus was clear, I mean c'mon, when I was fourteen I made a short stop motion animation film using an old Bell and Howell super 8 cam and even then I paid attention to the focusing. Okay enough of that, now for the pros of the film. The make-up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most MEN wince, the outdoor and some indoor settings had a NOTLD feel. Overall I recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds, at least you can say you saw it. Rent if you can, if not, buy used.",1128124800,2,771,3.9806451612903224

William Victor Schotten's ""DEAD LIFE"" just prooves the point even further as it is obvious this film was made with alot less money than any of the classics i named above & still seems to have that destine for cult status quality to it. This is a perfect example of doing so much with so little! There are a few zombie firsts & you will see what i mean when you watch it & the end is great!
