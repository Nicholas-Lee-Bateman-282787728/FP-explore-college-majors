2934437,5,B000VAHR6Y,"I really love those Iranian movies showing the women's life. In this one, a widow is trying her best to re-open the caf her husband had close to the Turkish border. Too bad for her, it is a real success and she falls for a german truckdriver qui loves her too.
Something not to do, being independent and having any relationship (even very platonic) for a man.
The tradition in that country for a widow is to marry the husband's brother and be wife #2. Since she refuses, the brother in law will do anything to close the caf.",1390953600,2,524,4.303030303030303
2934438,5,B000VAHR6Y,"Artful film about a woman whose husband passed away, leaving her their cafe on the Turkish border.

Its central theme is the role of women in male dominated societies. Its heroine, Reyhan, has just become a widow, with two small children to take care of. Her deceased husband's brother Nasser, offers, in the local tradition of that part of Iran to look after her by taking her as his second wife. Reyhan, however, is very independent and, spurning Nasser's offer, decides instead to re open her husband's truck stop caf. This puts her in direct competition with Nasser, who owns a much bigger truck stop restaurant. As her caf builds up customers, the tension between her and Nasser rises particularly when a Greek truck driver takes a liking to Reyhan.

What makes this movie stand out is Reyhan's skills cooking and the way it is conveyed to the audience. Great acting all around. Recommended.

2934441,5,B000VAHR6Y,"Border Caf&eacute;, filmed in 2005 in Iran portrays a widow's challenge to care for herself and her two children.  Her battle is with a culture that is not hers and a brother-in-law who fears dishonor.

When her husband dies suddenly,  Reyhan is left with a caf&eacute; on the Turkish border.  Through familial and cultural obligations, her brother-in-law, Nasser demands that Reyhan become his second wife and he will provide financially.

She resists their cultural traditions and  remains determined to become independent and raise the children.  She defies Nasser's request to build her a house with him.  And, she reopens her husband's caf&eacute; on the Turkish border.  She must remain in the background, in the kitchen while another employee waits tables.  The caf&eacute;, now a successful gathering place for truckers, competes with Nasser's restaurant closeby.

The characters are very well-acted.  Nasser, always with a scowl on his face comes across as combative, frustrated, angry, and fearful of dishonoring his culture.  As with good character roles and portrayals, we learn to hate him.  The character Reyhan is sweet and we strive for her independence, as we want her to succeed against tradition, culture and authorities.  The movie was well-paced, and with its mild suspense, we wonder how often she can overcome those against her.

Director and writer Kambozia Parvoti wanted to share his belief that people can communicate regardless of traditions and culture.  The film is about communication.  Reyhan communicates and bonds with a teen girl from Russia who is hiding out at the caf&eacute;.  Zakario, who is Greek communicates his desire for Reyhan even though they don't speak the same language.

2934442,5,B000VAHR6Y,"This well written, directed movie does an excellent job of examining the clash between traditional cultural expectations and a widow's determination to maintain independence.

2934444,5,B000VAHR6Y,"Seemingly episodic, but well-crafted, extremely subtle tale loaded with portent meaning.  Took me a few minutes to change gears and get in sync, and then was utterly engaged.

The few closeups there are are VERY potent, the film would've been even better with more.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** A portrait of sheer determination and patience- the tension between what is desired by and permitted for an Iranian woman is almost unbearable.  The ending is nearly implied, you have to watch closely- but ultimately, if you're the patient sort, a triumph awaits.  I admit I watched this through twice, and rewound the ending several times.  Sometimes subtle is better.  Highly recommended.",1486166400,,1138,6.840277777777778

This is the story of a brave strong woman, Reyhan who struggles for her rights once she lost her husband, Reyhan is a woman in a very traditional family where it is very common and even recommended to marry her brother in law because her young husband passed away. However, she stands up tall and alone against such a tradition, against the stupid and patriarchal laws, against her cruel and lascivious brother-in-laws and even against some women in her in-law- family. In the meantime, she falls in love with a foreigner. The movie seems sad but in reality it talks about hope, love and friendship ( between Reyhan and the Russian girl) .

2934460,4,B000VAHR6Y,"This joint Iranian-French production deserves credit for its deft portrayal of the insidious oppression of women by traditional (arbitrary) male hegemony in West Azerbaijan, just along the border with Turkey. Briefly, the storyline involves a widowed mother of two young children, Rayeh, who seeks self-sufficiency, while her brother-in-law, Mr. Nasser, strives to add her to his marriages and household. As the story unfolds, there is an ongoing intensification of the protagonist's struggle against male domination and the antagonists' fear-fueled efforts to oppress her, all of it transpiring in the context of a border cafe, where Rayeh's exceptional talents as a cook reinvigorate the place and take trucker business away from Nasser's restaurant. Despite some elements of melodrama, the screenplay (in subtitles) is coherent and linear, and the acting is really good, and the overall impact of the film is uplifting.

8217783,5,B000VAHR6Y,"For those who often complain that ""foreign movies"" are too artistic, too slow, well, this one is definitely not slow and its plot is very accessible and engaging! That doesn't take away any excellent storytelling quality. Captivating and well-composed, this is a fascinating slice of life in a border town - Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, etc. The cafe is where truckers of different cultures meet - Syria, Russia, Turkey, Greece, even Hungarians are mentioned in the movie.

A lot of reviewers have commented on the main plot so I'll skip that. I found myself worrying about the 19-year-old Russian girl. Although I wasn't driven away as a refugee of war, I was a 19-year-old female backpacker once and I now know how dangerous it could be for a young girl, alone, on the road, who doesn't speak the local language. She seems as naive as I was, and I fear for her every step of the way (except, of course, when she was living with the good people in the cafe).

This brings me to the point that the movie makes subtle but strong feminist points throughout. It shows you women are oppressed in different ways by different cultures - the differences are only in the extent and type. It also shows bonding of sisterhood through mutual understanding across language and cultures. It's a very humanistic movies, showing a lot of empathy.

A lot has been said about clashes of cultures, but i just want to add that for those of you who are into personality types like Myers-Briggs, one major personality clash in this movie seems to be an ESTJ with an INFJ.  The brother-in-law never understood what he did wrong, and never will.

It's also a reminder that whatever clashes we talk about (e.g. clashes between ""the West"" and the ""Islamic civilization,"" for instance) - well, moderates will always get along. It is when men like the brother-in-law dominate the scene, that the clashes will escalate into ugly war and full bloodshed. Unfortunately, there are just too many men like him in this world.",1526774400,,1988,4.750724637681159

The acting, story, scenery, dialog was really stupendous.  It's about a woman in Iran asserting herself and standing up for herself.  The spoken dialog is 95% Farsi, with the rest Greek and Russian.",1518998400,,318,4.526315789473684
8217786,5,B000VAHR6Y,"Like all other positive reviews I liked the strong message conveyed through a role of a widowed woman coming from a slightly different (less traditional) family and standing for herself and her believes against what was considered as ""Orf"" (tradition). Gladly these stereotypes are not as respected anymore and these types of traditions are not respected anymore as women are getting stronger and their voice is being heard.
I personally liked the parts were Reyhan and Russian girl were talking. The language was so strong that even though they didn't speak the same language but they freely spoke with the language of love. This is where we all connect and no border can separate us from each other. I could not think of any scene better than this to depict such moment.

8217788,4,B000VAHR6Y,"A nice little slice of life story about some traditions not everyone can accept especially the widow in this movie. Without giving much of the plot away the synopsis states a widow not agreeing to marrying her brother-in-law upsets tradition and really annoys that person in this movie. He hounds, harasses and interferes with her to the point she starts pushing back and then he does so even more. Shes not a woman who takes button pushing well and prefers to be independent. The ending is a real tribute to her determination and what can happen to someone when they fail to leave well enough alone. The only gripe with this one is if there are two lines in the subtitles the bottom one is cut in half and the lower half is not visible but its readable with some effort.",1505606400,2,771,4.475177304964539

Her diverse talents include some renovating and constructing a mud wall, but her greatest gift is her cooking. The food looks amazing, and the viewer might virtually smell and taste it, or, at a minimum, want some. Ones who do get to savor her fare are the countless appreciative truck drivers from many countries, who frequent her stop. What happens next and who will prevail remains to be seen.
