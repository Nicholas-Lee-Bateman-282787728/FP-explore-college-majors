8051202,3,B0007TFHCU,"The only other review of this work is so shallow and wide of the mark, that a few words are needed to set the record straight. Firstly, the work is not a Tone Poem, but a Theme and Variations for Orchestra and String Soloists. Just how many soloists can be a matter of debate, but the Cellist is usually credited with the major role and is generally named as such, sometimes along with the violinist (most often the leader of the orchestra). In this performance, the Viola player is also named as a soloist although he strikes only a few notes. The reviewer lauds the work and its performance in language of Olympian proportions, but he gives no references to other performances, or to other symphonic works that fall short of this musical Everest. If one takes only the symphonic works of this single composer, most who really know them would probably agree that Ein Heldenleben and Also Sprach Zarathustra are way ahead. As to other performances, there are at least half a dozen I have heard on CD that tower above this boring exercise in music-making. I first fell in love with this work, courtesy of George Szell and his bravura Cleveland Orchestra in the 1960s. The two best interpretations I have heard were by Karajan ( yes, the very same) and the Vienna Phil with Pierre Fournier as cello soloist, and the Bavarian Radio Symph. Orch under Maazel with Steven Isserlis and his cello. In their sense of commitment to the score, all three offer poetry, excitement and bombast in plenty. The conductors' grasp of the work's structure is infinitely more secure than here, and bearing in mind its outrageous complexity, and the difficulty in following the transition of the main theme through its 10 variations (there are no pauses, however brief, to tell the listener where he is and where he is going). By comparison with the works already mentioned, and also such gems as Don Juan, Till Eulenspiegel and the two symphonies (Alpine and Domestic) that offer a cornucopia of gorgeous melodies, all we have in this entire work is the main theme and its variants. True, Strauss does some very clever things with it, creating some very original sounds and textures simulating sheep, windmills, and a religious procession, but it speaks to the head and not the heart. It is arguably his most austere orchestral score, and certainly his most atonal. Potentially his most boring unless the conductor is able to generate enough electricity to hold the interest and attention of the audience. In this performance, the great Karajan fails miserably for at least the first half. Standing there, eyes closed as in a trance, looking totally disinterested in what the orchestra is up to, he looks to be more than half asleep at the helm, waking up only for the last third when a glimmer of animation lights up his features for the first time. In summary, taking account of the music alone, this is a rather dull experience.
I am not aware of any other DVD with which it may be compared, but I cannot think of a more inept use of a medium capable of adding such joy to music as is exhibited in the amateurish camera work here. It is almost a joke. Every frame is miniscule, showing a few of this and a few of that ---- three flautists, four horn players, five cellists at a time. Never are we allowed to see the full BPO in all its majesty, or the glorious Philharmonie where this audience-free quasi-studio performance takes place. It could be taking place in the middle of an ice cavern so glacial is the atmosphere. The final straw is the inadequate playing of the solo cellist representing the chivalrous knight himself. Reel after reel reveals the exstasy with which he strokes the strings with his bow, but much of the time these efforts result in no audible sound. He transforms the Don into a simpering effeminate character and makes an effective contribution to the mediocrity that characterizes this entire performance at every level.
This is the only work included, along with some trailers and a silly pompous booklet that provides more unintentional humor than genuine information. The best one can say of the whole enterprise is that it is as quixotic as its hero. I cannot end without pointing out that the previous reviewer, a man of few words, has had 27 reviews published by Amazon, of which not one is longer than two lines, and none meets the minimum limit of 75 words requested by Amazon who, regrettably, fail to enforce their own sensible standards. Yet 5 readers out of 5 claim to have found his review of this DVD helpful. I challenge them to say why, or whether they just happen to be friends or relatives out to provide a little encouragement.",1342742400,4,4657,4.7013463892288865

Herbert von Karajan brings this work to a magnificent height in his orchestra, a work fit for the gods.",1217548800,5,243,4.809523809523809
