8224754,2,B000WP09OU,"The best account of Pat Tillman can be learned from his family and friends in ""The Tillman Story"" not in the biography channel presentation.",1317945600,2,140,4.875
8224755,1,B000WP09OU,"Anyone reading this review probably knows who Pat Tillman is.  Pat Tillman was a unique, free spirited professional football player who walked away from a multimillion dollar contract to join the Army after the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  His story has been well told in all types of mediums since his death in Afghanistan.

A&E usually produces fine quality biographies.  I was frankly stunned at just how awful this one was.  It really tells the bare bones sketch of Tillman's life, and worse yet in a very amateurish fashion.

This documentary relies almost entirely on photos or pre-existing short snippets of video of Tillman in the storytelling.  Worse, it shows the same photos and clips over and over and over again.  Imagine someone telling you their life story with three pages of a photo album, and they flip back and show the same photos over again, and over again, and over again.  The video montage here is pathetic.

Further, there were no interviews with any family members or people Tillman knew in the Army.  Instead we have a just a few high school friends repeatedly telling us what a great guy Pat is. Gee, thanks for the information.
The only redeeming quality is that, from everything I've read to date, it got the facts of Tillman's life down correctly.

For anyone interested in Pat Tillman's life, I strongly recommend other sources.",1311379200,8,1359,4.8354978354978355
8224756,4,B000WP09OU,"I've got things to do with my life is a great book. Well written with attention to detail. My only complaint is that it is somewhat inaccurate with some of the more recent details about Cpl. Pat Tillmans death that have come to light. A great book, though. Especially for young men searching for a great role model.",1216252800,2,315,4.448275862068965
8224757,5,B000WP09OU,"A beautifully well done, partial story of Pat Tillman, an American Hero and his sacrifices. Pointed out facts but in no way claimed that Pat's ""way"" is the only way. Unbiased reporting of a tragic loss that is experienced every day by many. In no way did it make Pat out to be better than anyone serving their Country and that pleased me. Moving, thought provoking and a must see in my book. For young people needing a ""hero"" which I feel there are far too few of in this world today, Pat is a great choice! God Bless him and his family. I know he touched my life and my son's life in ways I could never explain.",1215475200,3,612,4.151260504201681
