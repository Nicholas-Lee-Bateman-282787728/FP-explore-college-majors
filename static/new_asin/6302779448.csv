511603,5,6302779448,"A beautiful film in which Nolte and Sarandon are at their acting best.  Lorenzo's Oil is one of the few ""based on facts"" films that I have watched and felt was worth while in every way. This film is worth  watching and I would recommend it to anyone who wants realism put on their  screen.  This is no sugar-sweet drama but a down-to-earth film about a  family who prove that sometimes-ordinary people CAN move mountains. As a  point of interest, the elderly English man in the film who manages to  create Lorenzo's Oil is in fact playing himself.  He is the actual Chemical  Engineer who helped the real Adone's in the 1980s and this is a touching  tribute to him, as well as to the Adone's tenacity and belief that they  could help save their dying son's life. A big thumbs up for this film.",948672000,10,793,4.4
511604,5,6302779448,"Lorenzo's Oil which I relate to in the same category as the book Let Me Hear Your Voice by Catherine Maurice is a very important film regarding parental love and fighting for your child. Similarly to the book, Lorenzo's  parents takes a confusing and ""hopeless"" situation wherein no  hope is offered for their child and turn the ""establishment"" on  its ear by not giving up. I believe that people planning to become parents  should see this movie as a required educational project, this is what can  happen and this level of dedication is a prerequisite to parenthood.",948240000,2,568,4.814432989690721

If there is one lesson to be learned from this family's struggle, it is that.  Don't let Lorenzo's suffering be in vain.

511885,1,6302779448,"This is a wreck of a movie posing as a medical drama. The movie is largely ruined by Susan Sarandon's performance as the shrieking harpy mother of a young boy with a baffling autoimmune disease (ALD) that is often terminal. (Nick Nolte is not far behind). As the drama unfolds, Lorenzo's parents engage in a wreckless nonscientific quest to save their son. They quickly alienate the doctors & researchers trying to help their son as well as other parents with boys with ALD. As Sarandon & company blunder ahead, they stumble upon a ""cure"", a special oil that supposedly arrest's the disease in it's tracks. As the movie concludes, we are led to believe that Lorenz's oil is a panacea for the disease saving thousands of lives. Unfortunately, none of this ultimately proved to be true. Lorenzo's oil barely does anything but slow the progress of said disorder. The real Lorenzo recently died at a very young age. The director, George Miller is a physician & should no better.

512024,3,6302779448,"LORENZO'S OIL is an interesting film for a few reasons. First, it's based on a true story and second, the director George Miller (MAD MAX) used to be a medical doctor, so this project was probably personal for him in a way that his others weren't. Before someone gets the wrong idea, I do think this is a good film. All of the performances were realistically done, the technical details are all artfully done, and the story itself is highly inspirational. That being said, the film is a bit hard to sit through since you are relentlessly bombarded with scene after scene of a child struggling for his life against a disease that (at the time) wasn't fully understood. There was also a steep learning curve when it came to all of the medical terminology that gets tossed around, although there was some attempt to explain the more fundamental concepts related to the disease at the center of the story. And what a disease! Lorenzo Odone was diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a disease that affects how certain fatty acids are processed and leads to serious neurological problems. Keeping in mind that George Miller is a former doctor, the narrative unfolds and is presented in a very clinical fashion, with an acute focus on time. To its detriment, occasionally this bleeds over into the emotional impact of what is happening onscreen. While it might be hard not to be moved by much of what is shown and discussed, there was a preparedness and calculation which undermined the more emotional moments (for me, at least). And about a third of the way into the film, after seeing scene after scene of suffering and hearing several cues of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, I just became numb. All of that aside, I thought the film brought up some very important points of discussion, such as how slow the medical establishment moves and the role of compassion in medical care. There are several scenes in which parents of ALD children are pitted against the foundation and doctors simply because they feel things aren't moving fast enough. Still, as the film makes quite clear, there are proper procedures and protocols to be followed. despite the maverick efforts of the Odones to find a cure/treatment for their son's illness at all costs. Hopefully, the less scientifically inclined won't take this film as evidence that parents can just do what they want willy-nilly without regard for established science. To their credit, the Odones did their own research and worked with scientists to develop the titular oil that helped to save their boy's life. Thematically, I think the film's main message can be summed up in the opening quote which, summarized, basically says that living is struggle while the end result is up to a higher power. Maybe the film hammers this a little too hard, what with endless soundtrack cues of choral and symphonic music, but the idea that science and faith don't necessarily have to be diametrically opposed is a compelling one. There are certainly other issues/topics which are touched upon, but I feel like I've covered the most significant ones. While it isn't a perfect movie, and is shameless in its emotional manipulation, in the end it is an uplifting story that I can easily recommend. Just be aware that the journey though it isn't easy.",1430179200,6,3286,4.859180035650624

I was told about this movie by Prof. Steven Rochlitz and his website wellatlast dot com and his Porphyria book, which turns out to explain many chronic or allergic diseases.

Now Lorenzo's Oil wonderfully depicts the tragedy of Lorenzo and his family. It shows how the supposed ""top doctors"" often know virtually nothing about the disease that they are proclaimed as the top doctors!

Then their supposedly helpful treatments or diet are dead wrong and cause great detoriation. Furthermore, the alleged helpful organization for the disease turns out to be very harmful to the sufferers of the disease, and their families!

All this happens with other diseases more often than you might believe.

Great acting by everyone in this film! Great script and one of the greatest and most heartwarming endings ever.

A young Italian boy named Lorenzo is completely healthy up until he begins attending kindergarten where his teachers begin to notice that his behavior is out of the ordinary. He gets angry and upset at the slightest things and doesn't seem to really care when he hurts people's feelings. At first his parents (Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte) think it's simply a part of growing up and he is just struggling to make friends. His symptoms begin to get worse however and within only a year, Lorenzo is unable to walk without help or a wheelchair. His parents are in a race against time to find doctors who can help their son or possibly solve the problem themselves.",1402704000,,829,4.684931506849315

Their son not to live over 3 years.

I would recommend this movie especially to the medical society.  As well as the public.  Life gives us challenges that we have to face. If Adam and Eve did not commit sin in the beginning.

512328,5,6302779448,"This is some movie!  Everyone who is interested in either their health and/or their family's health should see this ""moving"" picture.  All the actors were just right for this unraveling of the truth about the practice and research of mainstream allopathic medicine.  The business of medicine is not tuned in to the patient, they are tuned in to themselves, their credentials, their research and their ""funding."" This is the main reason why cures are far from the table in every disease mainstream medicine touches and gains control over.

In the story is another truth, no matter how well meaning they start out to be!  The Foundations that began with a good cause get all wrapped up in their ""non-profit business"" and their ""vested interest.""  Then the Foundation settles down to the ""business"" of supporting orthodoxy.  But then, when you think all is just about done, the film shows the heart and spirit of good men released (in part) from the control of the corporation and erucic acid is pulled drop by drop from rape seed oil for the completion of an effective formula to put adreno-leuko-dystrophy (ALD) at bay.  Two individuals with unstoppable GRIT did it . . not the massive research community looking for treatments.  The film shows that when there is a need, someone will rise to fill that need - and it is not usually a corporation.  It is the common man and woman that does the research and finds the answer -- not the giant mechanism of the lazy, fattened, for-profit corporations who are more interested in ""treatments"" and ""research"" than cures.

I have had a similar experience concerning lung cancer . . and cancer in general.

512391,5,6302779448,"George Miller is an Australian physician who took advantage of his medical background to create this one-of-a-kind movie. We are taken behind the headlines of medical research to see some of its inner workings in a true story about a rare and deadly disease, Adrenal Leukodystrophy. Sir Peter Ustinov plays the role of one of the leading researcher in the study of this disease, the basis of which scientists were just beginning to unravel Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon play role of the parents of a boy, Lorenzo, who has the disease. They are not passive regarding his illness but decidedly proactive to the point of sponsoring a meeting to helping the scientists work together to find a cure. At that meeting scientists discuss their findings and Lorenzo's parents realize that one of them, working in cell culture, has discovered a potentially curative oil. Shrugging off the warnings by the scientists that it would be difficult if not impossible to produce this oil and to use it in their son, they call around the world until they find someone capable and willing to purify enough to try the new treatment in Lorenzo. The rest of the movie is the unfolding of the triumph and tragedy of the disease in Lorenzo and other affected children. This movie is unusual, not only in its focus on medical research, but also in the fact that director Miller cast all of the scientists in the movie with actual scientists, except Ustinov only. Also of interest is the fact that the chemist who purified the first batch of Lorenzos oil, is played by himself.
This is not a light-hearted feel-good movie, but a deep and moving portrayal of the real-life struggle of two parents to fight in cooperation with, and at times against, the medical research establishment in an effort to save their son.",1353801600,2,1788,4.789644012944984

512417,4,6302779448,"I have a weak spot for dramas based on real life. In fact, I love documentaries, too, but this is truly my favorite genre.

Anyway, Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon play the parents of Lorenzo, a little boy who is smart and good-looking and a genuinely nice kid until he starts going haywire. It takes a while for him to be diagnosed with ALD, a pretty rare genetic disease that is passed from mother to son. That is, women only carry it, but only boys are afflicted with it. It not only kills, it does it in a slow and horrible way, stripping the myelin sheath off nerves. And gradually damaging the brain in the process. So he has a succession of losses -- muscle coordination, hearing, sight, breathing, swallowing -- that can take months or years to kill.

But Lorenzo's parents simply do not give up. They research in the library, they pester doctors and researchers, they join a parents' support group that is run by a couple of sanctimonious . . . well, they try everything. And along the way, they learn that it has to do with Lorenzo's genetic inability to digest cholesterol properly.

I didn't understand the science part very well, but the gist of it was that whenever they wanted to try something, the researchers had their protocols, more concerned with their data than with helping Lorenzo. Peter Ustinov plays Dr. Nikolius, the only one with the courage to help them ""unofficially."" They developed Lorenzo's Oil with the help of a sympathetic industrial chemist and an English chemist who was about to retire.

Finally, by way of a veterinary parallel in dogs, they discovered that a cure is possible. Lorenzo's oil was not a cure, but a treatment that halts the disease's progress. So it could not do much for Lorenzo, who was already quite deteriorated, but it became a life-saver for boys who had only just been diagnosed. At the end of the movie, there are a great many boys and young men who say how long they have been taking Lorenzo's Oil, and how they are able to live normal or nearly normal lives.

Since this was made over 10 years ago, it is possible that the cure discovered by the vet has been made available to humans by now.",1336694400,,2153,4.552971576227391

Additionally, the film allows them to see genetics is much more than 'who can roll their tongue' and who has 'curly hair'.

512423,5,6302779448,"I bought this to use in my high school science classroom to study the scientific method.  Usually students are taught the scientific method as a series of steps that are followed and then it's over.  This movie showed them how science really works, and also provided some important discussions.  The entire scientific method unit was taught using this movie and included the following:

- In the real world, the steps of the scientific method are often repeated.  Augusto Odone tests a hypothesis, and when the results don't back his hypothesis, he does more research and develops a new hypothesis.

- When research on actual organisms/substances isn't practical, scientists use models to conduct their research.  Augusto Odone develops 2 models, one using a kitchen sink to describe the action of long-chain fatty acids in the human body, and another using paper clips to describe the formation of these acids.

- Collaboration and communication between scientists isn't as common as we think, and sometimes research simply involves putting the work of several scientists together.  Michaela Odone finds research done on pigs that yields a missing component to her husband's research.

- Scientific research operates within the confines of government.  When the Odones come up with a therapy that works, they find that they can't offer it up to others without following FDA testing and approval laws.

- Scientific research operates within the confines of funding.  The Odones learn that scientific experimentation isn't cheap, and finding funding isn't easy because they had to find someone who believed in their discovery, and those who fund research are mainly interested in whether they will be able to mass produce the results for financial gain.

Additionally, on the myelin project website you can download lessons to use in biology, including lab activities.  Your students can also ask questions on the site, as well as get information as to what happened to Lorenzo after the movie was released the movie was released in 1992, but Lorenzo lived much longer.

512469,5,6302779448,"Two of the people who gave this movie a bad review (one star) said that the movie was not factual, and even suggested that the oil doesn't work in most ALD patients. I did a web search of only .edu websites and found that the two reviewers are wrong. Lorenzo's oil only works in about 2/3 of ALD patients, that's true. And it only works if those patients start taking the oil *before* the onset of symptoms. But they couldn't be more wrong about the huge breakthrough that Lorenzo's oli represented in the study of ALD. It's just that the cure turns out not to be as simple as was initially hoped.

Do a .edu web search of the following:

Bradley J Stith PhD Lorenzo's oil

He is a professor of biology at Colorado University who thinks that the movie is a great teaching tool for getting students interested in the field of biology. He also discusses every aspect of ALD, the movie, and the oil itself.

Now, as to the charge that doctors and nurses are portrayed negatively in the movie. That's only partially true, because for every doctor and nurse who was portrayed negatively, there were doctors and nurses who were portrayed positively. The doctor who finally diagnosed Lorenzo (in the movie) is played entirely positively, as are all of his nurses and assistants. And the doctor who is in charge of the dietary studies (in the movie) is portrayed only partly negatively; later he even helps the Odones ""off the record"" in their unprecedented experiment with Lorenzo and the oil. Two of Lorenzo's home care nurses are portrayed partly negatively and partly positively. For that matter, Lorenzo's own mother was portrayed partly negatively because her obsession with Lorenzo was making her start treating her own family members badly in some ways. Of course, she can be excused because she was a panic-stricken and desperate mother.

Don't listen to the naysayers. All of their claims are off-target. This movie is on my list of top ten films ever made.",1250121600,4,1959,4.733137829912024

Nolte and Sarandon are fantastic as the couple that would never give up on their own damaged son (although Nolte's accent can be a bit laughable). Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" is a nice touch as well. I would only recommend this film to those who are interested in science and good drama, but not to those who would NEVER want to see a kid's life being torn apart by a rare disease.

I do not recommend watching this when you have to get up the next day because you will be puffy and emotionally drained from the roller coaster ride you'll never regret viewing.

This is the true life story of the Odone family, Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo, and their battle with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a disease that attacks the central nervous system by systemically destroying its protective cover, the myelin sheath. It is an extremely rare disease that is transmitted exclusively to males through a gene that is carried by the mother.

This is a film that will inspire anyone who sees it to never quit and not to be defeated when told that what they want to accomplish is impossible. When you are facing impossible odds and you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, this is the film to watch because it gives inspiration. This movie will turn a switch on about how difficult it is to keep renewing optimism and that intestinal fortitude is what keeps hope from ending.

512504,5,6302779448,"With a heartbreaking real life story of the Odone family, director-producer George Miller created one of the most touching and emotional drama's ever to grace the big screen.  With an all star cast, most notably Susan Surandon in her oscar nominated role, he paints a very real picture of grief, pain, struggle and passion as the Odone's cope with the tragic desease that has attacked their son Lorenzo.

Lorenzo was only five when he showed the first symptoms of ALD, a very rare and very deadly desease that attacks your central nervous system by destroying your myelin.  It deteriorates your brain at a rapid pace and, in affect, makes you crazy and immoble before taking your life.  It's a desease that only manifest's itself in young boys usually between the ages of 5 & 10 and it's given to them only by the mother, for only mothers are carriers.  The desease, at the time of this instance which was the early 80's, was not very understood and so there was no hope laid out to the Odone family, just a list of horrible things their son would undergo before his death.  His life expectancy alone was only 24 months.

The Odone family, husband Augusto (Nick Nolte) and wife Michaela (Susan Surandon) decide to take matters into their own hands, doing emmence research to find answers to questions, answer none of the scientist and doctors seem to have.  No one even knows why this desease does what it does.  As the Odone's work and work to find a cure their son steadily gets worse and worse.  The Odone's are forced with moral issues as they confront the head's of an ALD support group, grappling the issue of their childrens well-being.  The question is raised a few times as to whether it's just or even humane for the parents to try and prolong their childs suffering.  Is it selfish to want your child with you always if they are in constant pain?  You have two extremes, and this film addresses both of them with equal ammounts of compasion.  You have the Odone's who want to save their child, and rightfully so for no one wants to lose thier children, but then you have other families that just want god to end their childs pain, and rightfully so for no one wants their children to suffer.

This is one of the hardest films to watch, especially if you have children for it forces you to contemplate what you would do, and that's not a question you want to ask yourself.

The Odone's were a very brave and very strong couple, who never allowed their situation to get the better of them.  Yes, they were human and they went through stages, they were crushed and they were hurt and they were dieing little by little every day as they watched the love of their life deteriorate into nothing, but they held it together for their son.  As his condition worsend it appeared as if they would never find answers in time, and as Aususto noted to his wife, all they were doing was probably being done for someone elses child, but that god for that for it's because of them that this desease is better understood and that there is a cure, or at least help.

Lorenzo's oil refers to the oil taken to help balance the bodies distribution of saturated fats that are killing ALD patients.  Lorenzo's oil is helping hundreds of children with this horrible desease and it's thanks to this beautiful family who sacrificed everything they had to make sure another family would have the answers they needed!

I wanted to make special note of Susan Surandon's performance here.  She completly commanded the screen.  I've always loved her and felt that she was one of, if not the best actress we have working today for no matter what the role she takes on she always leaves me stunned.  With this performance though I was especially drawn in.  She does so much with just the look in her eyes.  The scene when the doctor tells them this desease is passed on only through the mother, the look in her face, the fear and guilt and self-loathing in her eyes, you almost want to hold her and tell her it's not her fault.  Susan captured the emotions of her charactor PERFECTLY and left me with goosebumps.  Now Nolte is another story.  He kind of annoyed me.  Sorry people, but I'm Italian, and he sounded more Russian than anything else.  Bad accent.  Anyways, as far as his tortured father went, sometime he was little overboard, but for the most part he did well since he was the more stable more controlled parent who was trying to keep some sense of sanity in the house, but towards the end when he goes a little off his rocker he gets a little mad-scientist-crazy.  But don't let that deture you from this gem of a film.

Highly recommended but viewer beware, this is a hearttugging, heartbreaking, tearjerking assult of the senses kinda film.  Just a warning.",1150070400,4,4750,4.554770318021202

Lorenzo will not regain his speech or full mobility until we are successful with remyelination.

The acting is superb and the drama unfolds very carefully and deliberately.  I was immediately drawn in.  Having known families torn apart by the illness of a child, for me this film captures the paralyzing grief and sense of helplessness that paralyzes a household, and yet this film gives hope when the family starts to fight back against the disease.
Like Augusto did encountering the disease, I discovered I had learned a great deal just watching the film.  I wish more films could be as educational and entertaining at the same time -- a rare breed indeed!
If you haven't shed at least a few tears by the end of the film, I'm worried about you if you can get tear-free through the closing montage of boys who are alive and well because of Lorenzo's Oil.  Everytime I see that part, I cry.",1086393600,11,905,4.596273291925466

512520,5,6302779448,"In an effort to not spoil the film, I'll make this review more abstract.
With open source software development, there are various phases to the project:
1) there must be a problem that you want solved
2) you see if others have tried to solve it
3) if no one has solved it, you study up on the problem to see what's involved in solving it
4) you look if there are tools/papers/whatever available to help you solve your problem
5) through tedious trial and error, you attempt to solve your problem
6) finally, after you've solved your problem, even partially, you want to share your solution with the community
The rare genetic disease that their son has is ""the problem"" and the parents in this film go through all the above phases.  Most of the movie is focused on phases #4 and #5 (and it can get even a little tedious for the viewers at this point).  But there is a particularly poignant scene where the parents try to do phase #6 (sharing their findings) and are thwarted.  The bureaucracy of the so-called ""experts"" and the particular organization involved stops them.  (I guess this is sort of a ""Fountainhead"" moment in the film.)
I encourage all computer programmers to see this movie.",1054425600,5,1192,4.582159624413146

512532,4,6302779448,"This film is finely made, but that confirms me in the idea that scientific problems are very difficult to deal in the cinema. In this movie the medical statement are questioned. The most simple people could get the idea that physicians are mediocre or interested persons, and this is so in some cases, of course.
  But there are much diseases so rare that were unknown and undetected owing to poor conditions of general health until practically 50 years ago when infantile rates of mortality were much higher than now, so mostly of these illness were simply ignored under a huge amount of deaths. The parents of Lorenzo love his son, but they -over all the mother- borders the thin frontier between reason and insanity. Of course nobody is exempt of this under extreme conditions, but she demands healing here and now when this is impossible. The doctors are seen under a potent magnifier lens, and I'm afraid at so close distance nobody is good looking. The physicians must treat not only Lorenzo, but also much other patients with another diseases, something that the family of these sick children are unable to understand, and so, this movie presents for me several questions: the barrier between perseverance and mental blockade, the necessity sometimes of resignation and the misjudgement and devaluation of the scientific method. Cinema has a big influence owing to his easy sentimental impact, but I think reality is hard and truly there are things out of reach of science of today and tomorrow no matter how much you love your family... or if not, we should to be gods, no vulgar human beings.  Don't trust very much in miracles as the oil of Lorenzo. This film is good only if you see it only as it is: a fiction.",1044748800,,1722,4.752508361204013
512533,1,6302779448,"I saw this movie but was hesitant. WHY????
...This film was not at all factual, the oils do NOT work, we tried them. My heart went out to the family and to Lorenzo, but to say he can move his index finger, where is the aulity of life I ask you?
My heart aches each day... and I am deeply angered by this movie.",1035676800,12,310,3.859375
512534,5,6302779448,"This is the true life story of the Odone family, Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo, and their battle with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a disease that attacks the central nervous system by systemically destroying its protective cover, the myelin sheath. It is an extremely rare disease that is transmitted exclusively to males through a gene that is carried by the mother.
Augusto, an economist, and Michaela, a linguist, were a well educated, well to do, multi-lingual couple with a little son named Lorenzo who was precocious beyond his years. He spoke English and Italian fluently, as well as the language spoken in the community in Africa in which he spent his very early years. When he returned to the United States at about the age of five, his behavior started to change He came overly aggressive and given to emotional outbursts. After much angst on the part of the Odones over what could be wrong, they were finally told that their son suffered from ALD, which was the functional equivalent of having their son being given a death sentence, as there was no cure for this degenerative disease.
This well educated couple refused to accept the death sentence meted out to their son by the medical establishment. With no medical background, they disregarded conventional medical wisdom and went about trying to find a cure for their son, in a quest so remarkable and so moving, as to inspire absolute awe in the viewer. A more caring or loving set of parents would be hard to find. Lorenzo is surely loved. Together, Augusto and Michaela take on the medical establishment. What they ended up discovering rocked the medical world. To find out just what it was that they specifically did, you will just have to watch the movie.
Director George Miller does a masterful job in directing this film, avoiding the obvious sentimental traps and playing the film out in a very straightforward way. The ravages of this disease are fully played out and are not sugarcoated in any way. Nick Nolte gives a bravura performance as Augusto Odone, though his Italian accent needs a little work. He is superb as the father who transfers his emotion to the task of learning biochemistry in order to ascertain just what factors are at the root of his son's disease. His way of dealing with his son's illness is intellectual and methodical.
Susan Sarandon is sensational as Michaela Odone, a woman of such strength, resolution, and determination that it would be hard to find another like her. Her pain is palpable, as she sees her son deteriorate, but she refuses to take the path of least resistance where Lorenzo is concerned. In the face of daunting odds, she perseveres with Lorenzo, talking to him, as well as stimulating and challenging him. A notable performance is also given by Kathleen Wilhuite who plays the part of Dierdre Murphy, Michaela's sister and Lorenzo's loving aunt.
This is a sensational film that avoids all the maudlin, sentimental traps laid out in the formulaic disease of the week movies one often finds. This is a deftly directed, well acted film, informative and moving. It is a film that will stay with the viewer, long after the credits have rolled off the screen. This is a film that richly deserves a transfer to DVD. Bravo!",1018137600,99,3237,4.844765342960288
512535,5,6302779448,"Ok, i know what you are thinking.  Yes, I do.  You are thinking that this is just another movie of a disease struggle similiar to other.  Well, its not.  Along with a combination of great acting by Nolte and Sarandon, this movie combines the drama of a search for what isn't easily found with amazing accuracy.  All of the actors very well play the part of the Odone's, and put emotion into that similiar to what you would find if you spied on them yourself.  The drama of the story, the trauma of a disease with no cure and no help, it is just a knock-out.  Even the people who play the support group are able to be as snobbish (if not more) than were the people who turned the Odone's down themselves.  Do youfrself a favor, buy Lorenzo's Oil today. It deserves 10 stars, not 5!",1014681600,8,780,4.258503401360544

When i saw this movie for the first time in 1996, i was overwelmed. The movie is excellent, The acting is wonderful, and overall, i think it was a great idea for the movie. i have seen Loreno's Oils so many times, that i have lost track, and have been so inspired and interested in it, that i have chosen to become a doctor because of it (I'm a highschool sophmore). Also, in my Anatomy class, we have to do a 7 page report on the topic that interests us the most, and of course i chose ALD, Lorenzo's desease, and will also be using clips from the movie as part of my presentation. If this movie can make someone actually WANT to write a 7 page research paper, it must be interesting. i sugest anybody interested in the feild of medicine, or any feild for that matter, watch this movie, just once. after that one time, you'll never be able to stop.

My student died last week, however, his battle was not lost.  His family  chose to focus their efforts on their son and brother's quality of life, as  opposed to its quanity.  I would encourage the viewer to remember that this  is a ""dramatization"" and that there is more to the story after  the credits roll.  I've learned after having watched the film, and having  watched it in real life, ALD doesn't have to translate into a death  sentence.

Additional Comments:
- I bought the dvd to show in a biology class.
- It was made in the 90's so the picture quality isn't that great, but the story's pretty decent.
- It's not exactly the type of movie I'd rewatch on loop, but it was well-acted and heartfelt. (accents notwithstanding...some of them were downright awful; guy sounded Russian, not Italian.)
- Family drama is NOT my go-to genre, but I did like the movie.
- Poor Lorenzo.
- It's a great story of the parents' love and dedication to saving their son.
- It's debatable whether they truly saved him, but if that cure can even help one other boy's family, then the heartache is worth it. From no cure to some hope is a huge step.

Conclusion: Maybe not a movie everybody will go way out of their way to watch, but if you have the opportunity, it's a worthwhile experience.",1521072000,,904,4.407185628742515

The problem is the only reason that this based on real life story comes off as sort of uplifting is that the ending is made up.  The ending is a lie.  The parents did spend their lives looking for answers and a cure, but didn't actually find one and fell back on maybe healthy oil and good nutrition will help.  While it doesn't hurt, it doesn't stop, slow or cure this disease.  Their son was a permanent vegetable and one can only hope that has spirit was long gone from his body.",1507075200,,545,4.4
