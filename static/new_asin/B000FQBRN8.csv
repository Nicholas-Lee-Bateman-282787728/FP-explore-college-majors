8125532,5,B000FQBRN8,I have watched these DVDS 3 times now and it is the most powerful study on Revelations ever and all according to the word of God no guess work or your opinion only the word of God shows how much God loves us to have put this in the bible over 1900 years ago as a warning for us to escape his wrath it is not meann't for the Christians that have excepted Jesus as the messiah but for those that still reject what he did on the cross it is a loving warning. It was worth every penny but I hurt to think I have friends that have one foot in the world and one in the church we can not be hot or cold so he says he will vomit us out of his mouth. Since we are lukewarm you have to study the word and let the Holy Spirit teach you in your spirit what he is saying to you. It is not a book of fear unless you are following Satan then this is what will happen to you God has not prepared this wrath for those who know his son (Jesus) It is blessing to all that hear and read the words in the book...
