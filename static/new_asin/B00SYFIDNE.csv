8699830,1,B00SYFIDNE,"bought it for viewing on my 4K TV and was dissapointed that it is not really in 4K resolution, probably half that at most !

the 4K expreience is very obvious when you see it and this simply was far from 4K",1461456000,5,206,3.9047619047619047
8699831,5,B00SYFIDNE,Stunning 3D videography...I am glad I added this gem to my 3D collection. They made every effort to present the locations as though you are there in person. Great production!,1451952000,5,174,4.833333333333333
8699832,4,B00SYFIDNE,"Purchase for the India Documentary (1.5 Hours 2D or 3D)
DO NOT PURCHASE for the 4K UHD Stick!
If you have a 4K TV, play the Blu-ray in either 3D (The Best Detail) or 2D (Next Best Detail) and let the TV up convert to 4K - you will get a better PQ this way. PQ for the 4K stick, rated a distant 3rd!",1436486400,7,298,3.671875
