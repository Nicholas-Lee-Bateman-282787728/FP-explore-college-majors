8642531,5,B00IJE1BOI,"Interesting to see the parallel plot twists in some of the Shemp comedies as compared to the Stooges works in about the same time period (such as the use of alum, talking birds, etc.). The 4 Joe Palooka shorts on disc 2 are probably the least funny of the comedies, but still worth watching for the character ""Punchy"". A must for any true Shemp or Stooges fan!",1463270400,,360,4.388059701492537
8642532,5,B00IJE1BOI,"Its SHEMP!!  OK I'm a fan, so if there was disappointment to be had, my tolerance level would be less forgiving.  Instead there was much happiness throughout the land!  This is an excellent collection of Shemp's early work.  The quality of the transfers to disk are superb.  What a joy to watch such clean copies of these rare shorts.",1446163200,,334,4.593220338983051

8642534,5,B00IJE1BOI,"Another argument,if needed,for the canonization of one of the movie's underappreciated comic wise guys.
There's early 20th Century comic gold in these Shemp hills, and first rate quality prints to boot. If your
interest in movie history is deep, these shorts belong in your collection. Great, rare stuff indeed.",1405296000,8,311,5.36734693877551
8642535,4,B00IJE1BOI,Very interesting material that gives you an insight into what Shemp Howard did in his early days as a solo performer.,1404518400,6,117,4.619047619047619
8642536,4,B00IJE1BOI,"Well, Sony offered us the first glimpses of Shemp's solo career at Columbia Pictures with their ""Rare Treasures"" 3 disc set and now we have what many Shemp Howard fans have been clamoring for--the Shemp Vitaphone comedies, with more of an emphasis on featuring the lovable, grease-mop haired comedian than the previous Volume 1.

Although, the set gets off to what is in my opinion a very bumpy start with the less than spectacular ""Gobs of Fun"" short. Shemp barely registers in this picture & apparently, dialect comedians were all the rage back in the 1930s and 40s, but the 2 lead ""comedians"" from Gobs rarely registered a smile from me--much less a chuckle or guffaw.

Things get much better on Disc 1 by the time we get to ""Smoked Hams"", ""So You Won't T-T-T-Talk"" and especially the hilarious ""A Peach of a Pair."" Three Stooges fans will no doubt recognize the material from ""Peach"" seeing as how it inspired the stooge classic ""An Ache in Every Stake"" and inspired the alum punch scene from ""No Census, No Feeling.""

And I have to wonder, was Roscoe Ates the inspiration for Porky Pig? Maybe not, but that was certainly the first thing that popped into my head when I got a taste of his comedy.

Disc 2 is mostly comprised of the Shemp ""Joe Palooka"" shorts & if I had to be totally honest, as big as a Shemp fan as I am, I was a little underwhelmed by the Palooka series. And that's not to say there are not any good ones, but compared to the Shemp/Daphne Pollard/Roscoe Ates comedies, Palooka falls a bit short of the mark.

Maybe it's because I'm not exactly a fan of the sport of boxing, I don't know. In any event, that's the only thing preventing me from giving this a 5 star rating.

But overall, if you are a fan of the great comedian, Shemp Howard then the 2nd volume of Vitaphone comedies should please you--especially Disc 1.

4 stars",1402185600,5,1850,4.471810089020772
8642537,5,B00IJE1BOI,"I'm glad I purchased this collection of Vitaphone two-reelers featuring Shemp Howard. This set takes him from his second banana parts opposite Harry Gribbon and Daphne Pollard to his best second banana part as Knobby Walsh in the Joe Palooka comedies, every one of Shemp's appearances as Knobby are in here. In creating the part of Joe Palooka's tough manager, Shemp revealed a talent for comic acting, and the ability to turn his mannerisms into a character.. He also worked with Roscoe Ates and Ben Blue, there are a few examples of his support of them in this collection. He was already developing a lot of the shtick he used in his Columbia Stooge comedies, including the ""I can't see!"" routine, and the friendly build up to a violent slap which he uses in the Palooka shorts. It's a combination of extreme nervous energy followed by a tough belligerent attitude that defines Shemp's comedy approach in the early 1930s. There is also a fascinatingly low-brow quality to these comedies. They are not quickly timed slapstick car chase pictures like Mack Sennett made, nor do they have much of the ""heart"" appeal that Hal Roach favored in his pictures. These comedies were made for the cigar-chomping, Racing Form reading, baseball and fight fans who got a big rise out of a tough comedian hitting a milquetoast type comic. The slapstick dished out here is a very personal kind, Jules White carried it to an even more extreme plateau in his Columbia two reelers. Quality of the transfers here is very good from beginning to end. If they are from 16mm prints, which has been speculated, then they are really clean and first-generation 16s. Let's hope that Warner Bros. puts out some more comedy collections, I'd like to see Joe Penner's one and two reelers in a DVD collection!",1397088000,23,1777,4.791530944625407
8642538,5,B00IJE1BOI,"While some shorts are dated, they are still fun to watch.  I would rather see all come out in order than let a studio pick what we are going to see.  Kudos for Warner Brothers for doing this!  Anyone that is interested in the preservation of these 30's shorts should check out Vitaphone Project on the internet.  Anyone wanting to see more should support what Warners Archive puts out.  Credit to all involved.",1396396800,7,410,4.561643835616438
