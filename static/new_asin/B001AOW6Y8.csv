8278457,3,B001AOW6Y8,"We found this film to be quite entertaining, although the ""Monster Trout"" thing was a bit mis-leading.  It was filmed very well, and appears to be a production by some Michigan outdoorsy pals with some video talent.  You can't help but enjoy the film dispite the lack of ""Monster Trout,"" (except for the trout pond scene at the end of the film) because it's a trip that you can see yourself and your buddies going on.  That is what we found most appealling to us, and what makes us watch this film so often in the cold months when its tough to get out there and fish for yourself.  It's not Bill Dance or Roland Martin, it's some regular guys that you can really relate to on an average skill level, and they are jabbing at one another just as you normally would on a fishing trip.  Buy it-at a couple of bucks you can't go wrong, and it really is a fun video.  We hope these boys keep going, and by the way, they have a much better video that covers alot more ground called Feed the Addiction North American Hotspots.",1272240000,2,1018,4.276041666666667
