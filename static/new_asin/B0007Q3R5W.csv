8050422,2,B0007Q3R5W,"A middle ground half-cooked French comedy about the relationship between money and love.  But in the end this connection seems superfluous and counter-reality.  Money in this film is not influent in relations.  Money must be spent but you must care to your finances, is what the film says.  The less rich a character, the less developed his history (poor working mother, for example).  Social, ethical or even commonsense implications of actions are not even discussed.  Ideologically, regressive; dreams of the middle class.  Had some cheap laughs, that's true.",1129420800,,562,5.318181818181818
