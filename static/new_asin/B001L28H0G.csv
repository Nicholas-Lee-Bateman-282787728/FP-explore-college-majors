8316976,5,B001L28H0G,"The NUNS OF ST. ARCHANGEL is a great movie. It is easy to become so engaged with the action that the subtly presented ideas are overlooked. This movie is not only interesting to watch (action, scenery, and photography), but cerebrally challenging!",1287964800,2,247,5.048780487804878

8316978,4,B001L28H0G,"An intelligent release from Redemption Films, who are primarily known as an exploitation company, and that`s where these murky waters flow from - this one`s too sophisticated, historical, artful and classy for the 'naughty nun' choir, who are looking for cheap thrills ala 'The Nun Of Monza'(1980), by that godawful hack Bruno Mattai. This film is more along the lines of 'Flavia The Heretic' or 'Story Of A Cloistered Nun' (directed by Domenico Paoletta, who also did this film a few years prior), both of which transcend the nunsploitation catagory, as opposed to 'Alucarda' or 'Sacred Flesh', which ARE true examples of this genre (and I own `em both and enjoy them as well). So if you want a coherent storyline, good acting and direction with just enough nudity and the perks that come with these types of flix, you`ll enjoy it, if you`re looking for sexploitation sleaze, look away from the light of the Archangel...",1268956800,7,921,4.910256410256411
