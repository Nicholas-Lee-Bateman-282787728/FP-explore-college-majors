5784215,3,B00D9EJFRS,"Title pretty much says it all, and the low-budget dvd cover says the rest.  This was a rushed, low-budget, cross over of two mildly popular franchises that was basically a grab for cash.

Script was poor at best and couldn't be salvaged by even scent actors.  Character development was missing.  They even went so far as to rewrite the accepted history of the two franchises to fit this in to the world, which is why most people do not consider this a real PM or DT movie.  The puppets and toys are not anywhere near the quality seen in the standard franchise films.  Poorly crafted, little to no detail, and poor 'animation' of the stars is exaggerated by sloppy camera work.

All that aside, it is what it is.  One of those silly films you watch on a saturday afternoon to kill time.  No thought required, or even encouraged.  Just sit back and watch the B-horror lifestyle.

Rent, if you like the franchises.  Not sure anyone should really buy it.",1389916800,6,950,4.523529411764706
5784216,3,B00D9EJFRS,"A little while ago I paid $20 dollars for a used copy of this DVD. It's an awful movie but you have to have it if you're crazy enough to watch all the Puppet Master movies. The DVD I got looked identical to this, and this new release doesn't seem to have any more features than mine. This movie is not good, I think that there should at least be some new features, anything. Just reprinting a bad movie on a DVD with no extras seems pointless. Nevertheless I give this 3 stars because I know there are people like me who will want this to complete their collection and the version I purchased is becoming increasingly expensive.",1374364800,,628,4.330508474576271
5784222,4,B00D9EJFRS,Really good my daughter loves all this kind of movies. We are a big fans of Corey and love this movie he was amazing,1463184000,,116,3.875
5784223,4,B00D9EJFRS,I bought this movie because I've got all the puppet master series plus I liked it the first time I saw it on tape so when I saw this I felt I just had to have it.  I didn't care much for demonic toys when I saw it but it didn't matter when the puppets beat them.  I also liked Cory Feldman in it.,1461456000,,296,3.609375
5784224,5,B00D9EJFRS,"if you like low budget movies, as well as Corey Feldman than this is the purchase for you, however if you can find it at your local video store you can save a few dollars and check out the movie. I enjoyed it as well as my teenage son. He has an appreciation for low budget films. Quick shipping well packaged. Great seller",1454716800,,323,4.142857142857143

5784227,3,B00D9EJFRS,I love Full Moon Entertainment but this movie was a let down. The puppets don't make any noise. Pinhead and Six Shooter both look very different. They also go full robotic and make them sound animatronic. The dolls are also horrible except Grizzly still looks and sound the same. Baby Oopsie Daisy sounds like an elderly Italian man...I may have spoiled some things but these changes were quite annoying they even gave Blade longer hair...,1427673600,5,439,4.866666666666666
5784228,5,B00D9EJFRS,Arrived as described.,1423612800,,21,6.333333333333333
5784229,2,B00D9EJFRS,I don't think Corey Feldman is a good actor but I do feel like he could of have some standards and not done this movie. Unless he was really hard up for money or owed a friend a favor. I have seen a few of the Puppet Masters/Demonic Toys film and they are all  a little cheesy but I can appreciate all of the hard work it takes for the puppetry.,1423440000,,345,3.859154929577465

8590920,3,B00D9EJFRS,Even with Corey Feildman's overacting and the bad puppet designs it's far from the worst of the Puppet Master films.,1485820800,,116,4.85
8590921,5,B00D9EJFRS,"One of the greatest cross-over movies ever done. It's set during Christmas, so if you're like me and like horror movies any time of year, it would make a great addition to the Christmas section of your movies",1480896000,,208,4.5

8590925,3,B00D9EJFRS,"Having seen the first nine Puppet Master movies but yet to see a Demonic Toys movie I sat down and watched this Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys. I went in expecting abysmal as it was a made for TV movie and has horrible reviews but somehow I didn't mind it at all. Not much blood but one nice scene towards the end with popped out and exploding eyeballs.

 I couldn't really handle Corey Feldman's over acting and OTT gruff voice as Robert Toulon but Silvia Suvadova as the police sergeant and Danielle Keaton as Toulon's daughter were good but Vanessa Angel stole the show as Erica Sharpe head of the toy making company.

 The effects weren't great but everyone seemed to be having a good time and I enjoyed it for what it was.",1463702400,,726,4.395522388059701
