2504137,5,B000E6UZZK,"It really seems that the real point in buying a DVD Boxed Set is to save a little money. Therefore, as you can see, this Boxed Set has a price that's almost the same as the Years 1-3 Boxed Set. That makes it an excelente option for saving money. Moreover, on my case, I bought this Box because in Brazil we don't have a widescreen edition such as you have, and buying this international Box is the only way of seeing the movie at home on the original format. As sad before, maybe people doesn't have the option of renting the widescreen edition.

Finally, let me say that this is the best movie of the collection. Not even close to the magic of the book, but yet a very good entertainment option. I am a big fan of the books and I think the movie was able to show how different the story goes from now on, compared to the first 3 movies.

Buy it, you'll won't regret, specialy if you have kids at home.",1139702400,11,902,4.148571428571429
2504138,4,B000E6UZZK,"I don't understand why people review products they haven't used, seen, etc. Actually I don't know why I'm writing a review myself. I just wanted to say that it seems pretty pointless to buy a box set of the 4 movies when there are still 3 movies left to be made! If you haven't watched the previous 4 movies, rent it out on DVD. (That is, when dvd 4 becomes available.) Otherwise, I suggest saving your money for the box set that has all 7 movies.

However, that doesn't mean I don't think this box set has poor quality. On the contrary, I wouldn't expect anything less than great when it comes to its quality. Still, it doesn't make sense to buy movies 1-4 now and hope to buy a dvd box set of 5-7 later (or to buy movies 5-7 individually). The whole purpose of buying a box set is to save money right? Then, I suggest waiting (and renting) in the mean time.",1139702400,15,859,4.206060606060606
2504139,5,B000E6UZZK,I bought the 1-3 Collectors pack on DVD a few months ago. A very worthwhile buy for those that don't yet have the previous films. All in widescreen as that is the only way to go.,1137888000,7,178,3.9722222222222223

I also had the Prisoner of Azkaban (with English only). I was looking for the Spanish versions of the films. Even though it states in the description that the Spoken Languages are English, French and Spanish, only one of them came with the Spanish soundtrack. Very disappointed indeed, as I wanted my kid to be able to watch these wonderful films. Oh, well, have to send it back!!",1318636800,,537,4.663157894736842

2504553,4,B000E6UZZK,"Harry Potter is certainly an entertaining fantasy series. Overall, the three main characters - Harry, Ron, and Hermione - are well cast and convey both the joy and seriousness of the wizarding world. I do take a star off for the fact that the movies often have huge plots holes and sometimes meander off into irrelevant sidetracks. It seems the directors and scriptwriters weren't quite sure how to transform the books into movies. For example, it never really becomes clear how and why Voldemort has gained so many followers. Is it a certain ideology? Is it because his followers want to kill muggles? It just seems that he's a two-dimensional ""bad guy"" with nothing better to do than be evil. That's something I think could have been explored more than, say, Harry's flirtations with Cho (he ends up marrying Ginny anyway). Hopefully, there will be a extended versions of the movies like the Lord of the Rings extended versions that can fill in some of these plot holes and make the story richer. On the whole though, they're still fun to watch.",1264204800,,1047,4.758241758241758
2504554,3,B000E6UZZK,"The second installment in the Harry Potter series has some fun moments. I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart. He's well played and adds humor to the movie. Hagrid's character also gets some more development.

I'm not as crazy about the plot. It's a bit too convoluted, and much of it is never really explained well (even after watching ""Half-Blood Prince,"" I still don't understand how Voldemort could have controlled Ginny Weasley or lived through a book). Dobby was really annoying. He's way too dramatic and a sadomasochist to boot. Would anybody really believe that programming a ball to attack and almost kill Harry Potter was really going to succeed in keeping him away from Hogwarts? It just doesn't add up.

Also, the basilisk and spiders were somewhat disappointing and pretty dull. The spiders aren't as exciting as Shelob in Lord of the Rings. The basilisk was somewhat believable, but sometimes looked like a big movie prop. Maybe a special edition could be released with better monster designs.

Overall, this is probably tied with ""Half-Blood Prince"" as my least favorite in the series. It's definitely worth watching if you like the Harry Potter movies, but should have been much better.",1264204800,,1207,5.025
2504555,5,B000E6UZZK,"Great film series following great books. While the first two films are juvenile and the actors are too young to really do a quality job they set the foundation for the series and the visual/special effects are incredible. As the actors grow, the story does with them which is one of the reasons Harry Potter is so popular.

The fourth installment (Goblet of Fire) is the best film in the series so far.",1224028800,,402,4.506849315068493

2504558,5,B000E6UZZK,"A ""must"" for Harry Potter fans. Not only is the story's progress better by having all four films at hand, but the continuity errors are also easier to detect!! A few examples: Hagrid's hut changes location between films 2 to 3 (although it had been in the same place for the previous 50 years!), and the  terrain leading to it becomes more hilly. The Patel sisters are suddenly both members of Griffindor, though one of them had been originally sorted into a different house. The collection also includes background details on Hogwarts and the professors, interviews and other links. Film 4 DVDs include a segment on Ralph Fiennes and Lord Voldemort's conception.

2504622,5,B000E6UZZK,"In 1997, a children's book written by a then little-known author, J. K. Rowling, began to gain popularity in Britain. Entitled ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"", the book's title was changed when it was released in the U.S. to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". A year later, children who had been mesmerized by the first book got to read its sequel, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". Though a seemingly darker book than the first, more and more children (as well as adults) began to take interest in the amazing stories a boy name Harry Potter, who is also a wizard. As J. K. Rowling wrote each additional book, interest continued to rise as bookstores began to open at midnight upon each book's release date to the throngs of children and their parents anxious to read the next installment of Harry Potter's adventures at the magical Hogwart's School of Wizardry Witchcraft with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as they battle the evil Lord Voldemort. To date, five books have been written. The third, fourth and fifth books are respectively entitled ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"".  And, the soon to be released seventh & final book is called ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"".

With so much popularity, it was only natural that film producers would approach J. K. Rowling about transforming her wonderful books into big-screen films. The year (2001) following the release of her fourth book, the first film adaptation of her first book, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was released in theaters.  This was followed by the subsequent releases of the film versions of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" (2002), ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004) and ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005).

Starring Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, each of these four films is quite good. Also starring in all four films are Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon Dursley, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia Dursley, Harry Melling as cousin Dudley Dursley, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, legendary actress Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall and the wonderful actor Alan Rickman as the shadowy potions professor Severus Snape. Sadly, the brilliant actor Richard Harris (1930-2002), who played Professor Albus Dumbledore, died shortly before the second film opened in theaters. Stepping into the character in the third & fourth films was veteran actor Michael Gambon, whose seamless & identical portrayal of Professor Dumbledore was a true credit to his excellent acting abilities; though some were not as pleased with Gambon's performance as with Richard Harris.

A brief summary of each film follows:

1. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""

At 11 years of age, Harry Potter has been taken care of from the time that he was only one year old by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, who have a child of their own named Dudley.  They have taken care of Harry because his own parents, James and Lily Potter (Lily was Petunia's sister) were killed by the evil wizard Lord Voldemort.  The Dursleys want nothing to do with magic, and since Harry may be a wizard, they have not treated him very well.  However, just before Harry's 11th birthday, he received a letter from the Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft; but the Dursleys won't let him read the letter.  More & more letters from Hogwarts arrive until out of desperation, the Dursleys attempt to run away with Harry; but they are easily found and on Harry's birthday, a huge man by the name of Hagrid arrives to personally deliver Harry's invitation from Hogwarts to study magic.  It is only then that Harry finds out that he's a wizard and that the Dursleys had lied to him about how his parents died.  Harry leaves with Hagrid and begins his first year at Hogwarts, where he makes his first true friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.  It's an exciting story as Harry learns to play quidditch, learns potions with the unpleasant Professor Snape and becomes entangled in some secret affairs at the school.  He may even have an encounter with ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"".

2. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets""

At age 12, Harry has been treated slightly better by the Dursleys over his summer holiday, but things begin to turn sour when an elf named Dobby suddenly appears in Harry's bedroom to give him a message: that he should not return to Hogwarts this year.  Not accepting the warning, Dobby makes mischief while the Dursleys are entertaining.  Uncle Vernon puts bars on Harry's bedroom window and refuses to let him return to Hogwarts, but a flying car carrying Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George arrive and rescue Harry.  Harry's does finally get to Hogwarts, but students begin to be attacked by an unknown force and Harry starts to hear strange voices.  That's when they learn about a legendary part of the castle known only as ""the chamber of secrets"", in which a horrible monster is said to dwell.  Will Hogwarts get shut down, or can Harry and his friends figure out where the chamber is?  Look out for Professor Gilderoy Lockhart (the brilliant Kenneth Branagh) and Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson).

3. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""

At age 13, after Harry accidentally causes one of his other unpleasant muggle aunts, Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris), to inflate like a balloon, he runs away from the Dursleys and encounters a large black dog before a magical bus appears.  Harry has a wild bus ride to ""The Leaky Cauldron"" where he meets the Minister of Magic himself, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), but he doesn't' get in trouble for inflating his aunt. Instead, there is something far more ominous: Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a very dangerous prisoner and convicted murderer, has escaped from Azkaban prison.  Everyone at Hogwarts must be on guard, especially with the dreaded dementors on the prowl looking for Sirius.  While Ron & Harry can't understand how Hermione is getting to all of her classes (some classes at the same time), Sirius Black is looking for Harry.  When Harry finds out who Sirius Black is, he goes ballistic; but things may not be as they appear.

4. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""

This is an unusual year at Hogwarts: instead of the usual quidditch matches between the four houses, an international Tri-Wizarding Tournament is to be held.  Limited to only upper-class students that are at least 17 years old, everyone is shocked when Harry (14 years old) is named to be one of its contestants.  The Tri-Wizarding Tournament is somewhat dangerous to its participants, but Hermione finds herself in an affair with a world-renowned quidditch player, Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), who is representing his school in the Tournament.  In the meantime, Harry is attracted to a girl named Cho Chang (Katie Leung), but his life is complicated when he begins to experience strange visions of snakes and ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"".  What is ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" doing?  Harry will no doubt be caught in the thick of it and it may interfere with the Tournament!  Keep a close eye on Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who is at Hogwarts by invitation of Dumbledore himself!

Overall, I rate all four films together with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend them. In case you have a friend or family member that wants to watch/own all four Harry Potter films, but doesn't yet have any of them, the ""Harry Potter - Years 1-4"" DVD collection would make an excellent gift.",1182297600,,7708,4.932714617169373

Although entertaning, the movies can do little more than compress and summarize the complex plot of the written storyline.  I think they should make an excellent discussion thread centered around the stories, to demonstrate to young readers the difference between movies, constrained by time and expense and the writtne word, constrained only by the author's imagination.

The point wouild be to get the young reader to analyze what s/he has read in the books compared to how the movies present the stories.",1173571200,3,604,5.206185567010309

2504752,5,B000E6UZZK,"I spent the equivalent of a full day's waking-hours in front of my big screen TV this past winter break with just the 2 sets of the four Harry Potter movies and the three Lord of the Rings movies. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato.

Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire were all at minimum very good. Certainly Socerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as 5-star as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, but look at the footsteps that it had to follow in.

The list of A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.

Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens in their debuts.

Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuarn. Columbus still had oversight as a producer, so perhaps Cuarn felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuarn just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really shone through. And Cuarn was gone for Goblet.

Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuarn back to another vet in Mike Newell, 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.

It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating for Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Goblet...better start a rating system for playgrounds! How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, S.W.A.T. (2003) that does indeed not only have the F-word, but strong violence and sex? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.

I will indeed finish by saying that the first four of the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $2,000,000,000 (that's a TWO BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. And Goblet actually did better at the box office than Azkaban. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA.

If you somehow missed these movies as I did for some crazy reason, I hope that my long-winded review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Lord of the Rings...well that's another review entirely, of course.

I can't wait for the upcoming continuation of the Harry Potter series with Order of the Phoenix in 2007 and Half-Blood Prince in 2008. I am NOT a couch potato.",1167782400,,4089,4.730337078651686

2504756,5,B000E6UZZK,"First things first---Harry Potter isn't just for children.

He belongs to a mythic tradition as old as King Arthur and as new as Luke Skywalker, with such notables as Oliver Twist,

Huckleberry Finn and Dorothy Gale in between--all of them orphans whose adventures teach us something about life, loyalty,

and what it means to be a hero.

  This collection of four film is a fine introduction to

the mythology of Harry and Hogwarts, and gives viewers a chance to see its very young stars grow up.  Not since the glory days of MGM have such novice performers and seasoned veterans worked together so seamlessly.

  Sure, there's plenty of magic going on via special effects--

Buckbeak the hippogriff being a special wonder, but just as magical are the performances of the human actors--seasoned pros like Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, plus newcomers like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and especially Rupert Grint,

as fine a comic actor as any working today.

  This eight-disc collection (one for each film, plus a disc of extras) is a tremendous bargain.  If you love movie magic in any sense of the word, this is for you.",1156723200,7,1130,4.863157894736842

2504802,4,B000E6UZZK,"The movie is fantastic but I want to comment on the set.  It is sad that movie studios think that they don't need to put any effort in production anymore.  When the movie was still new and winning its audience, they really went out of their way to make a nice DVD.  It was in a letterbox format, lots of nice art, done beautifully. But the third movie the studio didn't feel like all that effort was necessary anymore - we got a plastic box with a colorful insert with information in it.  And by the forth movie? The colorful insert is not even there, just a plastic box with two DVDs in it. Wow!  Just because we love these movies doesn't mean the company has to treat the viewers like a money making machine. Come on!  Did They just pocket all the financial difference between producing a nice DVD set and a crappy one? Very upsetting.",1142467200,32,837,4.2993630573248405
2504803,4,B000E6UZZK,"I already have movies 2 & 3 and would like to buy movies 1 & 4.  I see on Amazon that I would spend $30.95 and no shipping if I bought only these two movies in the widescreen versions.  What does the box set offer regarding movies 1 & 4 that buying them separately does not?  The box set boasts 8 discs.  If I add movies 1 & 4 to my collection will I not also have 8 discs?

I'm just curious.  I've read the descriptions and wonder if I'm missing something.  Thanks all!

I love Harry Potter and would love to start showing them to my son.  However, I'd like to start with the first movie, LOL.",1141776000,8,594,3.9661016949152543
2504804,5,B000E6UZZK,"I went out to buy the newest Harry Potter DVD (Movie 4) on it's release day, even though I don't already own the first two (I do own Movie 3, however).  I knew I'd get the two I didn't own eventually, so why not get Movie 4 upon it's release?  I arrived at the store and noted the price for the 2-disc Widescreen Special Edition of Movie 4 was about $23 USD.  I looked around a bit and found this boxset with all four of the movies in it for $49 USD.  That makes them about $12.50 USD each, and even though I'm buying one movie I own already, I'm getting three that I don't for less than I would pay buying them all seperately (Movie 4 was half the price of the boxset alone!).

The boxset contains Movies 1-4 in the 2-disc Widescreen Special Edition format.  That is 8 discs total.  Each one is packaged the same as it's original release, though Movies 3 and 4 don't have the cardboard slip covers that came with them originally, but they still display just as nicely.  The box that the movies come in is rather weak and poorly constructed and I doubt I'll be keeping it, however I bought the set to get the movies at a bargin price and not to get a nice box to put them in.

I strongly recommend this set for anyone who wants to get the whole set for one low price, it's a great way to catch you collection up for cheap!",1141776000,122,1322,4.093023255813954
2504805,4,B000E6UZZK,"With eveyrone jumping back and forth about this product i wanted to let you know why i will be getting the 1-4 box set. reason 1. my son who is now almost 5 has ruined my first 3 H.P. DVD's, which is a note to everyone don't let your children within ten miles of your collection. So i am now getting this set so that i have the first 4 easily(and out of reach) so that i may watch them. reason 2. it is cheaper at the moment to get all four in a set, i really don't care how they come in the box, as long as it has all of the movies and discs..... Which by the way does anyone know if the set will offically have 8 discs total? i couldn't find that out anywhere. i am asuming so since there are two discs so far in each other movie and two coming out with GOF. Also does anyone know what the difference specifically know what the difference between the regular widescreen and the special edition widescreen is other then the price?",1141344000,8,931,4.037837837837838
2504806,2,B000E6UZZK,No need for those who already owned Harry Potter DVD separately to buy this box set edition.

2504807,4,B000E6UZZK,"Why bother even making a Collection, when there are still 3 (maybe more) to be made?

Sure so they can get Money, or if People have never seen them before.....But if they haven't, then get them seperatley!!!!!

I mean honestly!",1139961600,11,277,4.5
2504808,3,B000E6UZZK,"The movies themselves are absolutely perfect.  They contain every element you would want or even consider in a well produced movie.  My review is on this box set however.  I bought the first box set, and it was nothing more than a collection of the first two movies in the set that are already out and placing the two ""boxed"" editions in with the brand new ""plastic case"" 2 disc set.  Would it have been too hard to ask to get a unique version of these movies, such as the special editions found on TV.  The set just seems off with a plastic case sitting next to the two boxes.  If they return to the ""box"" set then the set would look even more uneven.  I plea to the ones in charge of this marketing to give us at least something we can be proud to display without always trying to make money off of us.  If they continue this marketing scam, and then finally give us an organized set I can only ask one thing.  Every true Harry Potter fan shouls boycott that set.",1139788800,17,965,4.172972972972973

8106856,5,B000E6UZZK,"Naturally for pure bibliophiles Movies are no substitute. For the rest of us the movie is the closest representation to the story we will see and we can compare and contrast to the story as it is written.

Regardless of which side of the fence you may be on the movies is the only representation for many. And having them in one collection adds an esthetic plus. This is what movies are all about.

Even if you already own one or two of the films it is worth re-purchasing.

You can read the individual reviews for each film to get a feel for what this series of films is about. Notice that they changed directors on the third film and the feel of the series. You can speculate on the next film; however I would buy the set now and make a decision in the future as to a set of four movies.

One unique approach to this series if that the characters get older with each movie and the stories reflect changes in attitude and world views.",1506038400,19,935,4.235955056179775
