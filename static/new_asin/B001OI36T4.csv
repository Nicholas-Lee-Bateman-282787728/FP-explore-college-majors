8330661,2,B001OI36T4,"I bought this dvd thinking there would be a ton of exercises and a workout routine, but its just around 25 exercises squeezed in a 30 minute dvd, and 35 dollars for it is definitely not worth it, 10 out of the 25 exercises are already available on youtube. Plus the techniques shown are really quickly demonstrated.
I wouldn't suggest buying the dvd, if its price drops to around 10 dollars then its ok.",1439164800,6,403,4.45945945945946
