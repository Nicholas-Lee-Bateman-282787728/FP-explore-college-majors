5072546,5,B007AMRTXW,"I saw this in 1954, and fell in love with it immediately. The story is simple, wonderful and totally real for its time. One of the
greatest lines, when the two boys have had the baby for a few hours and it just smiles and gurgles at them, Davy says to
Harry; "" 'e's not a gabby baby, is 'e?"" I almost rolled out of my seat. I can picture & hear the two little fellows now. i never saw
the TV movie with Charleton Heston. I would never bother. This is one film that cannot be re-made. I agree that TMC, or one
of the cable channels should show this movie ocassionally. I would really like to see it again & I have several friends who saw
it with me who would also like to see it again.",1362960000,2,684,3.9280575539568345
5072547,5,B007AMRTXW,"I first saw this movie in the theatre when I was a little girl and viewed it on tv many times after that, but that was decades ago. I have not seen it shown on American tv in forever. I have looked for it on video or DVD and been unsuccessful. I just checked IMDB and there were some postings about its availablity, but the first site I checked had the much later Charlton Heston version, the other British site was unavailable and Amazon, which is supposed to have everything, only has it in a format I can't play! And I don't think Netflix has this original version either. Out of all the thousands of movies I have seen in my lifetime, this one has stuck with me for some reason. It is a charming story and the two little boys at the heart of it were wonderful. I loved their accents and the way they said the word baby. Why TCM or someone isn't showing this, I don't understand. Please, someone, anyone, help me find this movie so I can see it again!",1346630400,11,954,4.190217391304348
8513473,5,B007AMRTXW,I found the movie at SantaFlix.com that can play in North America. It is the most adorable heartwarming movie I have ever seen and many times. The children are the greatest  ever seen on the screen.  Forget any other version.,1417824000,,225,4.6
8513474,5,B007AMRTXW,"I saw this movie nearly 50 years ago and I am STILL talking about it.  The kids fell in love with the baby and I fell in love with the kids.  What a story!

And I will second the lament made over and over again about this movie:  Why the heck isn't TCM or some other cable channel showing this?  It's priceless, it's a classic and it cannot be duplicated.  Been there, done that and failed.  And why is it not available for play in our (US) region?

There's just so much junk out there these days.....and this gem is lost to us.  Alas....",1409702400,,538,4.096153846153846
8513475,5,B007AMRTXW,"this precious movie! I have searched and searched for this.  thank you thank you for having it for me to buy.  I love this story and those are the cutest, sweetest little kids, I ever saw in a movie. I can't wait to share with my grandchildren.`It is the most perfect story to share with children. thank you, thank you.",1400457600,,319,4.3
8513476,5,B007AMRTXW,"I don't understand why this film isn't readily available to North American audiences. It is a charming story that warms the heart without making one squirm. I've recommended it to people of various ages and backgrounds, and it was universally loved. Indeed, what's not to like about this tale? All of the characters are so vivid, but the children especially are wonderful.  Those two little boys certainly deserved their honorary Oscars.  After watching this, I found myself quoting their dialogue to myself -- and smiling inside.  If you can your hands on a copy, get it. And for North American viewers, get some video conversion software. You won't regret it.",1380672000,,661,4.990909090909091
8513477,4,B007AMRTXW,"I love this movie! I think it was originally just called ""The Kidnappers"". Set in Nova Scotia, Canada at the turn of the last century. I saw it so long ago and kept thinking about it. It's so sweet, so touching. And I love the accents - not hard to understand either. I had looked forever to find it on DVD, it seemed to no avail and then came across santaflix dot com.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  I ordered and they shipped quickly and I am really happy with it.

I am so glad I found it. I plan to give it out next Christmas.

Why don't they make them like that anymore? Really? The kids in THE LITTLE KIDNAPPERS are wonderful, not little brats, like they might be today, just kids who want a dog.",1367107200,4,701,4.094890510948905
8513478,1,B007AMRTXW,"My problem is only that I thought I was getting The Little Kidnappers, 1953. Instead it is The Kidnappers. I know it is the same movie, which I give 5 stars. The only thing I did not know when I ordered it is that it can't be played in the US. I had ordered two copies before of The Little Kidnappers and got the right ones. It is a favorite movie of mine which I saw around 1953, and I wanted them--still want them for Christmas presents.

But I was disappointed to see that these aren't playable here. I don't know why the seller, knowing that, would send them here. I must return them, and try to get The Little Kidnappers that can be played. Otherwise it won't be of much value.

They were sent promptly and in good condition. I want to be credited for the price and the postage because I was not aware that I was going to get the wrong product.",1366675200,2,849,4.13939393939394
8513479,5,B007AMRTXW,"this is a great film! it ran often on TV in the US in the '50s and 60's, which is where I saw it.
this is a sensitive story, beautifully acted and filmed. I agree with the other reviewers that the two boys do a marvelous job.
I would love to get this film on dvd, if someone will only put it into US format!",1365724800,,307,3.7384615384615385
