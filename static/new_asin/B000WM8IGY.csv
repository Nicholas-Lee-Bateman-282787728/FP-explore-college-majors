2983507,5,B000WM8IGY,"I can not express how important the Wynton Marsalis series ""Marsalis On Music"" is for the serious music student and and extreme pleasure for all music lovers. I wish I had these tools when I was a
Trumpet student as a kid. It is inspiring and opens young musicians eyes, ears and minds to all kinds of music, every kind of music has roots well demonstrated in the ""Marsalis On Music"" series.
This is a four part DVD: Part 1 titled ""RHYTHM. Part 2 titled ""FORM"". Part 3 titled ""From Sousa To Satchmo"". Part 4 tiled "" Tackling The Monster - Practice"".
You will see and hear young musicians playing like professionals that is inspiring to music students whether their instrument is Brass, Guitar, Drums, Voice and all others. You will also
be given insights from Wynton Marsalis' jazz orchestra and some fine music from New Orleans.
This four DVD set is an excellent gift. You will hear new things every time you watch it.
Wynton Marsalis is one of the greatest musicians in the world and he shares his talent, experience, and knowledge like I have never seen or heard before on DVD.",1303171200,4,1080,4.572164948453608
2983508,5,B000WM8IGY,"I have been using the Marsalis on Music videos in my classrooms since they were released.
I still learn something new each time I show/watch them!
These are a great supplement to any teacher's curriculum.
They are also enjoyable, for those who want to learn more about music or just listen to good music.
I use these in classrooms from grades 4 through college.",1297382400,,361,4.65625
2983509,5,B000WM8IGY,"If you like music, or want to give a great gift to someone who does... or as a learning tool for young music appreciation - GET THIS VIDEO SET!

Marsalis and his cast do a fantastic job going through MANY styles of music and helping explain how it works, how they are put together (especially the 12 bar blues), and how to listen to and appreciate it.

I saw this when it aired on PBS, and had to track it down and own it for watching over, and showing to my children as they learn about music - to broaden their horizons and appreciation of other music forms.

It's the best primer I know of to introduce a love of music, as well as a good understanding of the forms music takes to any interested viewer/listener.

This will be understood by ages 6-96.",1295913600,5,753,4.244755244755245
2983510,5,B000WM8IGY,"As a freshman in college, I remember setting my alarm for Saturday mornings so I could be sure to watch this as it was airing on PBS!  I'm not a musician, but I loved the intelligent and intelligible way that he taught the basics of music.  Our VHS set is in tatters, so I'm glad to see that it is finally available on DVD!",1264809600,4,323,4.03125
2983511,5,B000WM8IGY,"For non-musicians, music sometimes seems to be a ""mysterious"" and sometimes ""magical"" world.  Wynton Marsalis presents music in a way that even children can understand (which is obviously his intent).  Wynton has a knack of speaking plainly, yet he presents the material with integrity and with innovative creativity.

This DVD set is worth every penny I paid for it and should be considered a ""Must Watch"" for all school children, all people wanting to learn about music and for all musicians.

Well done Wynton Marsalis.  You have taken your place amongst all of the greatest Music Educators of all time.",1257724800,,606,5.02
2983512,5,B000WM8IGY,"I really like this series.  It is great for use in the music classroom as a launching point for discussion into a wide variety of topics.  It is well designed for use in the middle school.  I think most would try to use it as material for a day when they were going to be absent, but it easy to create worksheets or discussion questions with the videos with a pre-viewing of the videos.",1236124800,4,386,4.1891891891891895
2983513,1,B000WM8IGY,"I watched this on a cable channel a while ago, and I was so glad to finally see this on DVD (it was only available on VHS), I read the review of the other same title DVD and I decided to get this because this one seemed not to have the 1:30 Devine comercial, to my bad luck the person who shipped my product from amazon apparently didn't have a clue of this and sent me the Devine (cheaper) one and I paid the price for this one :-( I don't even know if I could something about it.

Wynton Marsalis is the best by the way. Thank you Wynton for this great series. One recommendation for the future in DVD, the one on Duke Ellington, I think it was called ""In Duke we trust"" or something like that.",1226707200,4,696,4.0071942446043165
2983514,4,B000WM8IGY,"I can't recommend these DVDs enough.  Wynton Marsalis communicates the fundamentals of jazz using illustrations from everyday life (playing basketball, etc.) in a compelling, visually interesting way.  His use of famous contemporary musicians (including gifted children) makes the lessons more inspiring, as do the artistic backdrops and illustrations.  Simple enough for beginners, but complex enough to keep intermediate students interested, these lessons appeal to both children and adults.  Each of the four DVD's (""Why Toes Tap"" [rhythm], ""Listening for Clues"" [form], ""Sousa to Satchmo"" [the jazz band], and ""Tackling the Monster"" [on practice]) may be purchased separately, though, so consider that when purchasing.  The price is high for the set, which is why I rated this with 4 stars, but I know of nothing else that communicates these ideas as concisely and as down-to-earth in such a fun way. This would be a good addition to a school media library, or a homeschool co-op.",1226620800,12,984,5.363636363636363

8223702,5,B000WM8IGY,"Great 4 video series.  Excellent for explaining concepts to students.  The four videos are titled:

Why Toes Tap - rhythm
From Sousa to Satchmo - early 20th century American musical styles (marches and Dixieland jazz)
Listening for Clues - musical forms
Tackling the Monster - effective practice techniques

It does have its share of challenges.  He decides to use totally different terms when explaining the Sonata Allegro style for symphony.  He uses ""Sonata form"" for short and uses different terms for the three segments.

Music textbooks use Exposition, Development, and Recapitulation.

Marsalis opts for Statement, Fantasia, and Restatement.

However, I use this as a teachable moment.  I chart it out on my whiteboard, do a compare/contrast, and discuss with my students why he might choose these terms.  It also gives a moment to teach prefixes (""Expo"" and ""Recap"").

Overall, I give it the highest recommendation!",1424563200,,923,5.289655172413793

8223705,5,B000WM8IGY,"Wynton Marsalis knows his craft and he knows it well. In this DVD set he lays bare the essentials of music and delivers the information in a very approachable way. My students really enjoy this DVD set. Marsalis delivers the complex fundamentals of music in such a way that my students can easily grasp abstract concepts like: rhythm, odd and even meter, syncopation, melody, and improvisation. Mr. Marsalis captures a moment and creates an atmosphere for any student interested in music to actively engage in music fundamentals that is practical and makes sense to them. I highly recommend this DVD series to any music educator. Wynton Marsalis is a musical master and living legend of our time that can command the awe and respect of any person regardless of age or knowledge base.",1351900800,5,783,4.894736842105263
