7956477,2,B00005Y6Z4,"This is obviously a very old VHS that has been transferred to DVD.  The Images are grainy, fuzzy and worn.  None of the crisp images or vibrant color you expect from modern cinematography.  It looks like it was shot in the early 80's on VHS tape.

That said, the content is exactly as advertised.  Sweeping beautiful landscapes presented in time lapse photography.  Great for playing in the background.

Overall while l enjoyed the content, I felt cheated by the image quality.  What they should do is go reshoot this in high definition.  Now THAT would be a video worth buying.",1163635200,4,578,4.7

This was just the thing. The scenery in this DVD is really beautiful. I could just watch and meditate almost. Even though the music is relaxing and fits with the scenery, its sound quality could be better. I don't even think its in stereo. A minor point I suppose, considering I usually run it while listening to CDs. Its a bit short too... only about 30 minutes. Not exactly a deal for 18 bucks... The makers sell it for 25 on their website. They do however have several offerings, some of which are a solid hour. For the price its a little short of my expectations in duration, but I'm liking it...",1016928000,4,761,4.328671328671328
