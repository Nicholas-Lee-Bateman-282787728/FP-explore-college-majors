4901984,1,B005X7H9Y0,"I am sorry that no HD version of the Packers Super Bowl gane will be released. It is a bad decision, one I hope will be corrected. Keep the low def DVD.",1322179200,9,152,3.78125
4901985,1,B005X7H9Y0,I have been waiting for this to come out since spring and now there is no Blu-Ray? Excuse me but the games were broadcast in HD and I've been waiting to see a real 1080p Blu-Ray version of all the playoff games. I will wait until a proper release or find some other means.,1322006400,10,272,4.055555555555555
4901986,1,B005X7H9Y0,Vivendi is showing its true colors.  They have become one of the cheapest studios out there.  I bought the Superbowl XLV Blu-Ray.  I will pass on this joke of a release unless they reconsider.  HD is what people want.  I don't watch the NFL in SD any longer... why do they think I will buy a standard def copy of a HD broadcast?,1321920000,8,328,4.142857142857143
4901987,1,B005X7H9Y0,"Vivendi isn't going to sell many of these. DVD's are older technology that not many are looking at now.  It is really amazing that a media company releases something like this broadcasted in HD and then purposely reduces to lower resolution.  I guess they are showing they will be cheap in creating this kind of content.  The NFL better think about contracting with someone else to sell their wares, Vivendi isn't the answer here.",1321920000,8,430,4.783783783783784
4901988,1,B005X7H9Y0,"Green Bay is the smallest market in the NFL which, in the NFl's eyes, apparently justifies not even making a blu-ray version of this product. Sad and selfish on the NFl's part.",1321833600,9,176,4.53125
4901989,1,B005X7H9Y0,I really don't think I'm going to buy this if it is not blu-ray.  I can watch the games in HD on nfl rewind on my TV.  Why would I spring for non-HD?,1321660800,8,149,3.484848484848485
4901990,1,B005X7H9Y0,"It's 2011, almost 2012.  The lack of availability of this set on BluRay is an embarrassment for both Vivendi and the league.

Both the 2010 Packers season highlights and the Saints Road to the XLIV were both released on BluRay, albeit on a different vendor.  But the change in vendor is no excuse.

I refuse to shell out money for sub-par video quality when better should be made available, no matter how compelling the content.",1320710400,7,428,4.666666666666667
4901991,1,B005X7H9Y0,Vivendi has stated they will not release a Blu Ray (HD) version of the Super Bowl.  This goes against all other years road to super bowl boxed sets.  Obviously Vivendi hates the Packers and that is why there is not a Blu Ray version.,1320451200,9,233,4.2727272727272725
4901992,5,B005X7H9Y0,"Why is this item not being released in BlueRay format?  This makes no sense.  If someone has a link to the BlueRay version, please pass it on!",1320278400,8,142,4.222222222222222
4901993,5,B005X7H9Y0,"huge packers fan here, i've been waiting for this since the end of the super bowl, but i figured it just got pushed back due to the lockout, cant wait as the release day is the day after my birthday, go pack go from a ny packers fan, a fan since 92. hopefully this is released and not scrapped. I will keep my fingers crossed.

hopefully its released on bluray as well",1320105600,10,368,4.111111111111111

4902026,5,B005X7H9Y0,Here you get all 4 of the full games from Packers Super Bowl XLV run. OK this may not be HD quality but if you are a Packers FAN/OWNER this is a great collectors item to have. Great to look back on the great moments in Packers history.....,1433548800,,239,4.0

4902029,5,B005X7H9Y0,This DVD on my 50 inch tv was wonderful. I love basketball and football. Even though I'm a 49ers fan I still enjoy the sport in general and like Aaron Rodgers. Green bay is a good team and franchise. This is a great buy. As far as the other reviews go about the picture quality I dis agree on that. The picture on DVD on my HD tv was crystal clear. Rather its DVD or blu ray you will get a nice picture!.,1431302400,,404,3.8795180722891565

4902032,4,B005X7H9Y0,"As others have stated this DVD set is in standard definition, but since something like this is not available in Blu-Ray or HD. This is as good as it's going to get. Still four amazing games that unless you still have them on your HD-DVR are not available anywhere else that  I'm aware of.

Hopefully in the future they will release a set like this on Blu-Ray and when they do I will be in line to buy it.",1423008000,,404,4.10126582278481
4902033,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I just watched the Super Bowl and am currently watching the divisional game. The picture quality is amazing, extremely better than expected. Seriously, this is just as good has HD. All of the buyers from 2011 unfortunately must have received lower quality sets. Do as I did and base your decision off of the more recent reviews. I received this as a gift, which was purchased from Amazon. Go Pack!

Pros:

Full games, completely commercial free.
Picture quality is just as any other game I have watched within the past few years.
You get to watch one of the greatest franchises make a one of the best postseason runs in NFL history.

Cons: (aka my picky expectations)

You cannot ""skip"" possessions. You can only ""skip"" to quarters. So you can only fast forward over parts within the quarters that you do not care to see.
Although it's not listed in the product details, I expected the post game on-field ceremony to be included on the Super Bowl disc. Instead they have some interviews indoors from some of the bigger name guys(not Rodgers or MM).
Sometimes the commentary is cut off when the the game goes to a would-be commercial.",1422835200,,1133,4.678391959798995
4902044,4,B005X7H9Y0,"Not the greatest quality since it is DVD. I would have much rather had blue-ray, but since it isn't available I settled for this.  It is awesome to be able to relive the Super Bowl winning post season by being able to watch all four games.",1420675200,,239,4.195652173913044
4902045,5,B005X7H9Y0,Other reviewer's opinions are nothing short or ludicrous. Hi def snobs or not this collection is PERFECT crystal clear resolution not a play missing even includes the press conference after each game. Any must for a bored packer fan in the offseason.,1417737600,2,250,4.976190476190476
4902046,5,B005X7H9Y0,"DVD (No Blu-ray) This is Packer history, and die hard fans like me appreciate these things whether in prime condition or no. Seriously, I think Packer fans are some of the selfish individuals when it comes to memorabilia and don't appreciate some of the little things in life. Unfortunately, when I read these comments, I see the selfishness of my fellow Packer brethren. We're not Dallas fans, darn it. We're much more appreciative than that.",1417392000,,443,4.92
4902047,5,B005X7H9Y0,"It is not HD quality but it just like on tv watching playoff games. Thought this is awesome because I never seen any Super Bowl Champs that have games on DVD of their playoff wins including the Super Bowl. Plus this DVD provide closed captioned!!!!

Awesome!!!!",1402704000,3,261,4.673913043478261
4902048,3,B005X7H9Y0,"Poor picture quality. Other than that, it is what I expected it to be. I would buy others if offered on Blu Ray.",1386115200,2,112,3.9130434782608696
4902049,5,B005X7H9Y0,"i read the reviews and alot of people said the video quality was bad but i am a packers fan so i decided to buy it anyway. when i played it, the quality wasn't horrible but i could see what they were talking about, but i didn't mind i was just happy that i got to see those games again! the four playoff games are unedited and are the original broadcast which is great, i didn't want them to be the documentary type or edited to be just thee important plays, i wanted it to be the full game and it was! overall i recommend if your a packers fan, i love it!",1384819200,4,556,3.9292035398230087
4902050,5,B005X7H9Y0,Truly an amazing Set of DVD's that any and every Packers fan would love to have in his/her collection:)The best part is that there are no commercials :D,1378684800,,152,4.464285714285714
4902051,5,B005X7H9Y0,this has the full games of the packers going threw the playoffs it was exactly what i wanted thank you very much,1361232000,,112,4.136363636363637
4902052,5,B005X7H9Y0,"Am I correct in assuming that the reviewers who are leaving 1 and 2 stars have home recordings of the initial airings and are just waiting for an HD/Blu-Ray release?  Even so, I don't believe this dvd deserves that low a score.  I don't mean to offend, but being picky about picture quality doesn't justify the low ratings.  For me, this dvd is a gem. A god-send, if you will.

I had the Superbowl recorded on my DVR box.  The box died and I was mortified that I lost the game.  I came across this dvd on Amazon and jumped on it.

OK, so it's NOT HD Quality, but it's not as bad as an old VHS like some of you are describing.  I should know. I still use a VCR and have plenty of VHS tapes.

I'll try to explain the quality.

You know when you watch something in HD on your DVR/Tivo and then you try to record the program onto a DVD recorder or VCR without an HDMI input?  That's how it looks.  It plays back in letterbox.  The picture is STILL clear but it's not sharp like HD. I'm glad I bought it.  Not only was I able to get the Superbowl game back, I got an additional 3 games on top of that.  All you Packers fans should buy it even if the quality is not as good as you are now used to in this day and age.  Better something then nothing at all.  And it comes with extra's too!

Look. If you already have your home copies, that's fine.  You may not need to purchase this unless you want the extra's.  But it's still great for those of us who weren't so lucky the first time around. I'm just grateful I got it back.",1351900800,,1519,3.9833887043189367
4902053,1,B005X7H9Y0,"I saw my friends discs and the quality just isn't there.  This desperately needs to have a Blu-Ray version produced.  I noticed the Giants Road to Super Bowl XLVI has both a DVD and Blu-Ray option as well as the Saints the year prior to the Packers run.  This is unacceptable, it is the year 2012!",1344729600,4,297,4.267857142857143
4902074,5,B005X7H9Y0,"It's true - the picture quality is not great. Like everyone else, I really wish is was offered in Blue-Ray format.  But, it's watchable and worth buying. Plus, if you're a true Packers fan, you'll watch it while enjoying a few adult beverages. If you did care of the picture quality, you won't after having a few. Just buy it.",1344124800,,326,4.433333333333334
4902075,5,B005X7H9Y0,"All I can say is anyone that does not rate this at least 4 stars has to be an Eagles, Falcons, Bears or Steelers fan. There are no issues with the quality of the video or the sound. Anyone that gives this a poor rating because it is not on Blu-ray and has not watched these DVDs should not be allowed to comment on its quality. My only regret is waiting so long to make my purchase. If you are a true Packers fan you'd buy these games even if they were taped onto Beta!(anyone born after 1985 will have to look up that reference) Ignore the doubters, pessimist, and naysayers.  Follow your Green and Gold heart and watch four of the best Packers games to ever be played. GO PACK GO!",1342396800,3,682,4.166666666666667
4902076,5,B005X7H9Y0,"Is it blu-ray? No. Should it be blu-ray? Yes.

That being said, if you are a true Packers fan, you will be pleased with this collection. It is the entirety of every 2011 Green Bay playoff game (minus the commercials and the SB halftime.)

I realize that some may be disappointed with the lack of HD, and I am as well. Still, watching Rodgers and the Pack annihilate every team they face in the 2011 playoffs is a great time, even if it is in standard definition.

Should Vivendi change their standards? Obviously the answer is yes. But still, despite the reduction in resolution quality, this dvd set is worth it.",1340841600,2,613,4.504504504504505
4902077,1,B005X7H9Y0,Ridiculous that they'd release a DVD with no blu-ray option these days.  Weak.  Release this with an HD option or there's no chance anyone buys it or rates it any higher than a 1,1340496000,4,178,4.205882352941177
4902078,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I don't know what all the people on here are talking about. There is nothing wrong with the quality of these DVD's. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched them on my high def big screen using my blu ray player, after reading so many negative reviews. Don't be afraid to order this.",1336348800,5,284,4.377358490566038
4902079,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I don't understand how people can rate this item before it released or when they haven't purchased it.  I viewed these DVD's on my HDTV and they look awesome even though they are not BluRay.  Who cares if they are not BluRay, the quality of the games was just as good as the HD feed I DVR'd. Awesome set and a must buy for any FOOTBALL fan!",1329350400,4,340,4.059701492537314
4902080,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I purchased this DVD reluctantly after reading so many of the negative reviews about the image quality. Those reviews were unfounded. Yes, it would have been nice to have a Blu-Ray version, but there are no image quality issues with the DVD. I have tested the DVDs on a Blu-Ray player with hi-def TV, an upcovert and a regular DVD player with a hi-def TV, and a regular DVD player with a regular def TV. Looks fine on all TVs and allows me to delete my DVR recordings. This is a great addition for any Packer fan and DVD has postgame press conferences that are far more complete than what was seen on network TV.",1329177600,9,612,4.3304347826086955
4902081,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I don't own a blu-ray TV. I have a 720 HDTV and it's every bit as good as my recording of the Super Bowl on my DVR. Now I can free up the space on the dvr and watch it with this set. The great thing is that I didn't dvr all of the playoff games and here they are!  If you aren't a blu-ray snob, this is a great set.",1325289600,8,315,3.436619718309859
4902082,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I received this as a gift for Christmas and I am very happy with it. Is it HD? No, but the quality is fine by DVD standards. Some of the other reviewers stated that this is inferior to VHS recordings. That is a joke. I tend to think the same disgruntled Blu-Ray owner made multiple negative ""reviews"". I just watched the first disc last night and I was quite pleased with it. It even had a press conference after the game. I look forward to watching the other discs as well, and for the price you can't go wrong! Go Pack!!!",1325203200,5,523,4.188118811881188
4902083,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I have read the reviews offered, and am disheartened at those reviewers who opt to ""review"" the lack of a BluRay version.  I agree, the BluRay version would be better, but I wanted to get my hands on the standard DVDs to enjoy watching the games, not every drop of sweat on the individual players.  Hi-def snobbery has its place (I can be as much a hi-def snob as the next guy), but if the product doesn't exist, move on until it does, please.

I have watched these four discs on four different TVs - three hi-def and one standard.  My hi-def laptop, the 24"" hi-def with standard DVD player in my bedroom, and the 48"" hi-def with BluRay player in the family room; and the standard 11"" DVD player in our kitchen.  Not great quality on the little standard screen, but it was built for the non-discriminating distraction lover while cooking or cleaning the kitchen.  The laptop images were crisp and clean (my laptop has a hi-def screen but a non-hi-def DVD player).  The images on the TV in the bedroom, with the standard DVD player, were crisp and clean as well, but the best image quality was with the BluRay player - because mine (and most on the market today) will clean up and enhance the image of standard DVDs, it was almost pristine.  Again, for the product, it is exactly what I was hoping for in image quality.

Content:  What can you say?  It's the Packers.  Loved all of the games.  If I could create my own DVD set, it would have included the last two games of the regular season as well - the stomping of the Giants and the last game against the Bears - both deemed ""must wins"" and, in essence, of playoff caliber.  The added bonus of post-game press conferences was a nice touch - McCarthy, Rodgers, Woodson, Jordy Nelson, Greg Jennings, Donald Driver, AJ Hawk ... I might be missing a few, not sure.  Another nice (but curious) touch was the inclusion of non-game-related footage - the presentation of the Punt, Pass, and Kick trophies to the award winners in their respective age groups, and the salute to the military.

What's missing?  Nothing, from the standpoint of other DVD sets like this.  For the fan who loves listening to the radio calls rather than Troy Aikman and Joe Buck (they call the game for all four discs), I would love to have the option of toggling between the TV feed and the radio feed - to include the opponent's radio feed; how cool would it be to listen to the disappointment in the Falcons' broadcasters' voices?  And for my money, there are few radio guys who can match up to Wayne Larrivee and Larry McCarren on Packers Radio Network.

For my money, this was an excellent, excellent set of discs.  Unless there are some compelling bonus features on the BluRay release (if it comes), I will happily stick with these.  They are a must for all Packer fans.",1325203200,6,2797,4.486166007905139
4902104,4,B005X7H9Y0,"This is a great DVD collection for any Packer fan. The playoff games against the Eagles, Falcons, and of course the hated Chicago Bears all in beautiful if not perfect picture quality!!! Of course being able watch Super Bowl XLV and relive the unlikely road to a championship was the best! I have watched them all twice and I cant get enough! My only disappointment is that they are advertised as he original complete game broadcasts however, they are really the edited down versions for the NFL Network. That aside I highly recommend this DVD set, and it is a most worthy addition to any DVD collection!!!!!",1325116800,3,608,4.691588785046729
4902105,2,B005X7H9Y0,"Did not buy this product since the reviews are so bad.  Even those who rated it higher say the video quality is not very good.  I just sent an email to the Packers Pro Shop and they have assured me that many fans have send correspondence to them regarding their requests for a Blu-ray version.  Hopefully they respond favorably to our requests.  In the meantime, enjoy the Packers in Super Bowl XLVI in stunning HD on your television.",1325030400,3,434,4.5256410256410255
4902106,2,B005X7H9Y0,"I agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of HD.  The SD quality is average.  Some of the close ups are OK but the on the field play visibility is poor quality (blurry).  I wanted to wait for a blu-ray version, but when will it come?  I purchased it as a Christmas present for my spouse.  Really disappointing to watch from an HDTV.  Sad that the NFL can't make a quality product for us.  It's a slap in the face for Packers fans.  They had 9 months to put this together and can't do blu-ray?  Shame on the NFL!!!",1324771200,6,519,4.161616161616162
4902107,1,B005X7H9Y0,"What is this, it is almost 2012 and the NFL is not releasing this on Blu-Ray?  I watched this at home live on HD and I expect to be able to re-watch this in HD.  The Steelers and Saints got Blu-Ray versions and the Packers don't.  What is this now?  The Packers are a smaller market team and its fans can't afford to pay a few more bucks to get HD?  Come on now NFL, release this on Blu-Ray.  I will not buy it till then.",1324080000,6,421,3.8372093023255816
4902108,5,B005X7H9Y0,"It makes NO sense that a blu-ray version was not created. However, I did purchases this because I wanted physical copies of the games. For 25 bucks i'll live with this. My real disappointment is that the radio calls for each game were not included. Listening to Joe Buck is far, FAR worse than the quality of the picture.",1323820800,2,321,4.4576271186440675
4902109,5,B005X7H9Y0,"I purchased this set of DVDs with much trepidation as I had read the reviews about the ""terrible quality"" of the picture.  After receiving my set and watching parts of each DVD I am left wondering what the poor reviews are all about!  I have a 60 inch HD television and an upscaling DVD player and I must say that the picture quality is comparable to that of the original television broadcasts. I am so happy with the quality of the picture I am deleting all of the games from my DVR. I don't know if the picture would be acceptable without an upscaling DVD player, but since that is all I own, I can recommend this set to anyone with an equipment setup similar to mine.  Even if this set came out on Blu-Ray I wouldn't order it as I am very satisfied with the current product.  It is also great to have the press conferences from Coach McCarthy included after each game. For only 25 bucks you can't go wrong!  Shipping was also very quick.  Thank you Amazon for making this product available!

On a side note, I find it interesting that many of the one star reviews are from people who say they will not purchase this set and demand it on Blu-Ray.  I don't know how one can rate a product without actually using it.  As an actual OWNER and USER of this DVD set I recommend it to any Packers fan interested in preserving the playoff run to Super Bowl XLV and the victory over the Steelers.  GO PACK GO!",1323734400,12,1402,4.256603773584906
4902110,4,B005X7H9Y0,"When I first saw this item available for pre-order, I had to reread the product description a few times just to make sure that it was really promising the entirety of the last four games of the Packers' phenomenal 2010 postseason, including their Super Bowl XLV victory. As a lifetime Packers fan with a DVR full of games I just can't seem to bring myself to delete -- and having watched these four particular games on an almost endless loop over the past year -- I was amazed to see a price tag around the twenty-five dollar mark for this. I jumped at the chance to own it, and I haven't regretted that decision for a second.

Reading the reviews here, one would think that some customers and their families were personally targeted by Vivendi and/or the NFL by their failure to produce this in HD. Last week, I popped in a videotape (!) of a game I had recorded many moons ago on the local CBS affiliate using a RABBIT EAR antenna on the top of our TV at the time. There were points when 'snow' interference blurred a play or two, but I wasn't watching it for the clarity. I was watching it because I loved the MEMORY of that game and what was going on with the Pack (and with me) at the time it happened. Mission accomplished.

As soon as I got these DVDs in my hand, I held my breath and inserted the disc of the Atlanta game, prepared for the worst after sifting through all these complaints. Imagine my relief when I discovered that the game was perfectly fine! I switched back and forth between a couple of plays from that game still on my HD DVR and on the DVD, and there is absolutely a drop in quality (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but it's certainly nothing that will keep me from enjoying these four games for years and decades to come! Besides, I know the NFL Network has the games in HD and they'll still show them every once in a while. Someday, they might even release this same set of games in HD on Blu-Ray or whatever the latest, greatest technology will be in the future. When they do, I'll bet it'll cost much more than twenty-five bucks... and you'd better believe I'll buy those, too! In the meantime, though, these will suit me just fine. The people leaving one-star reviews for these discs are HD fans; they're not Packers fans. Their complaints that this should have been released in HD are kind of like complaining about a toaster because it doesn't slice your bread for you. These discs were not advertised as being in HD, and the price is just right for that. If you're a Packers fan, you'll love having these games in your collection.

My HD DVR will probably last another year or so before it's replaced with a newer, better model, but these DVDs will remain, and they'll be just as watchable 20 years from now and bring back just as many wonderful memories as that videotaped game from 20 years ago brought me. Will I care that it looks a little snowy and it isn't in full-surround 3D? Nope. The Packers won the Super Bowl!

4902111,1,B005X7H9Y0,"I got this as a gift and I have to agree with many of the other reviews on here... What happened with the picture and sound quality??  The original standard definition broadcasts on my DVR look better. Granted I want to have a nice packaged and edited copy for the future.  But this set fails on even the most basic levels. Wait for a fixed version.

Where is the blu-ray??  Seems like Vivendi is trying to sell as many copies of this first and then make half of us re-buy the blu-ray set. If so, that is a downright scam. However seeing the rush job on this I would definitely have concerns about that version if it ever does arrive.",1323475200,4,634,4.258333333333334
4902112,3,B005X7H9Y0,"When I purchased this DVD set, I was well aware that it was not in HD.  However, I had been waiting for this set to come out for so long that I went ahead and bought it anyway.  The games are great, obviously, but the lack of HD is more noticeable than I thought it would be.  I adjusted the picture settings on my TV, which helped some, but after watching so many games in HD, it's difficult to revert back to SD.  I would recommend purchasing the set irregardless, because there's no telling if they plan on produced a high definition version of these games.",1323475200,,560,4.254716981132075
4902113,1,B005X7H9Y0,"Let's ignore the fact that for some reason there is no Blu-ray available.  The video and audio quality on this DVD rivals a VHS tape from 1980 that's been watched about 500 times.  If these are the actual network broadcasts, then they must have been recorded with someone's cell phone while standing in front of the TV.  I can't believe this is official NFL merchandise.  Save yourself some money and go watch video highlights of these games for free on Youtube.  You'll be much more impressed at the production value.",1323388800,6,518,4.711111111111111

I have many games from the 80s and 90s and they are mutch worse but i love them to. People to day just want everything and have all in Blue ray.

4902155,1,B005X7H9Y0,"I kept the super Bowl on my DVR and and video quality of this DVD is noticeably worse even for Joe six pack that doesn't have a blu ray player yet.  Horrible decision to release this only on DVD, especially considering the large Packers fanbase.  Hopefully they still have time to come to their senses and will release on blu ray or include two years if the Packers win again.",1323302400,3,376,4.357142857142857

All I could think was amazing it would be to have these games to watch whenever I pleased. That being said, I refuse to buy this if it is not released on Blu-Ray. My mom has this recorded on VHS, I can just watch it anytime I go over there. This is worthless and I will not be purchasing.",1323216000,8,378,3.986842105263158
4902157,1,B005X7H9Y0,"This makes no sense at all.  Why would you even consider not releasing a Blu-ray version of a sports spectacle that was meant for HD?  If Vivendi decided this on their own then the NFL needs to get in touch with them and TELL them ""if you release our product it has to be on Blu-ray"".  Maybe when Vivendi is sitting on a few freight cars full of unsold SD dvd's they will realize their mistake (but probably not if they were dumb enough to do this in the first place).  If nothing else, when they start dumping the SD discs on the clearance market for 5 dollars I might finally break down and get one if that's my only option but I'm sure not buying it now.",1323216000,22,657,4.109375

4902163,1,B005X7H9Y0,"This release is a complete failure. It seriously looks as if they recorded it off the t.v. with a VCR and just paused it during the commercials. If anyone did view this monstrosity,did you notice the glitch at 1hr 13min 53sec of the Bears game? The video just freezes for second or two. I returned my first copy in hopes that it was just a fluke,but there it was on the second copy also. I hope Vivendi didn't get paid too much for this. Horrible,just Horrible.

4902204,2,B005X7H9Y0,"OK, I am a Packer fan, so I sprung the cash for this. Don't follow my lead. I was stunned by the poor video quality of the Super Bowl broadcast. To say it looks like a VHS recording off an analogue source is being only slightly hyperbolic. The sound is OK, so long as you don't have it turned too high. But the picture is fuzzy and with poor detail even in close-ups. Extremely disappointing in comparison to the high quality of the ""greatest games"" DVDs. Shame on the NFL and Vivendi for releasing this inferior product.",1322697600,36,521,4.381443298969073

Hopefully this will send a message to Vivendi that there is a market for this, and they will release these games on Blu-ray as NFL Films has for the last few years. When they do, I'll be the first in line to order my copy!",1322697600,8,474,4.10752688172043

4902208,1,B005X7H9Y0,"Today on the Green Bay Packers official Facebook page, they announced that this ""Road to XLV"" DVD set is now available.  Many people commented there that they want the set to be released on Blu-ray.  The Packers responded with the following comment:

""We checked with Vivendi Entertainment and they stated that there is no Blu-Ray set being produced.""

So there you have it.  That means the product description is a lie - it says it contains the ""original network broadcasts of their thrilling four-game post-season run"".  But the original network broadcasts were in HD, and you can't have HD on standard DVDs, HD can only be on Blu-ray.

The NFL messed up on this one.  They released the Saints ""Road to XLIV"" set on Blu-ray, and now they're going backwards with the Packers set.  Standard DVDs only look good on old CRT TVs.  I've tried watching them on LCD HDTVs, and they don't look good at all.  I won't be buying this.",1322611200,8,924,4.6419753086419755
4902209,1,B005X7H9Y0,Are they really not releasing this set in Bluray???? Does that mean every Super Bowl set from now on will only be released in DVD or are Packers fans just getting a raw deal.,1322611200,4,174,4.147058823529412
4902210,1,B005X7H9Y0,It is an absolute joke that this is not being produced in HD. I refuse to spend any money on the standard version. How can it be that both the Steelers and Saints versions from the last two years be produced in HD but the Packers is not? Everyone needs to boycott this product until they decide to unveil an HD version.,1322524800,7,319,4.161290322580645
4902211,1,B005X7H9Y0,"If you want a SD version of the Super Bowl you can download it from YouTube for free.

I will hold out hope that Vivendi figures out what customers really want and release a Blu-Ray version (and soon!).",1322524800,10,332,4.516666666666667
4902212,1,B005X7H9Y0,I don't understand this. All of these games were broadcast in high definition when aired on TV. So why are they downgrading them now by only releasing them on DVD? It makes no sense.,1322524800,8,182,4.382352941176471
4902213,1,B005X7H9Y0,"Once again, the NFL wants your money and is banking on you giving it to them even though they are purposely releasing a sub-standard product.  Yes, I know it's Vivendi Entertainment that is releasing this, but one has to believe that they are in lock-step with the NFL in how this release is being done.

The fact that they are taking archived broadcasts, recorded with HD cameras, and releasing it on DVD only is a slap in the face of the fans.  If you're a backwater octogenarian who ""can't tell the difference with HD"", then by all means go ahead and enjoy this DVD set.  However, if you're one of the tens of millions of people who watch football every week on an HDTV that you purchased in the last few years, then stand your ground and let Vivendi & the NFL know that just because Green Bay is the NFL's smallest market doesn't mean that the fanbase deserves the smallest effort.  Once again, the ""Road to XLIV"" boxed set for the Saints was released on Blu-Ray...a year ago.  This is progress?

No HD - no thanks.",1322438400,10,1019,4.4171122994652405
