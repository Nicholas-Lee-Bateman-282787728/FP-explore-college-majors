I haven't ever read the book and, perhaps, that would explain the far more positive review than almost all of the reviews for this on Amazon.  Here's my take on this...  I originally saw this in the theater. I was drawn to it because Ian McShane was in it, but when I left the theater, my thought was that we would definitely see more of Alexander Ludwig and, indeed, we did.  I liked the pacing and my only real complaint was with the casting was The Rider.

Still, I think the movie is a great story regardless.  If you can push past any adaptation bias which may be creeping inside you, you can watch this movie and enjoy the story it does create.  It does have a fascinating plot and great characters.  The world in which they live is really deep and wonderful, the kind of place I would love to live in.

3009348,1,B000XUUQRE,"Dull mess with no magic that totally dishonors the book it came from and the author who wrote it!

I didn't read the book, but my roommate did, and he said the same thing about The Seeker that people are saying on this and other sites...

The director, writer, and producers of this movie didn't really follow the book at all, and definitely did Not improve on it.  In fact, they totally RUINED it!

Since I didn't read the book, I will just comment on what I noticed is wrong with the film itself...

The story is supposedly a battle between ""the Light"" and the dark. ""The Light"" itself is something that is hardly ever talked about in movies or TV shows, so I thought it would be very cool, but in this movie it is portrayed 100% wrong.  The one time the kid actually uses ""the Light"" all we see is a regular fire on the floor.  ""The Light"" is Not flames.  It is actually Light (yes, in another dimension, but actually Light), and they missed an opportunity to show how powerful it can be, and how people can use it to protect themselves and be guided by it, etc... but that's probably the point, isn't it?  The backers of Hollywood films allow the makers of the films to go so far with metaphysics, but to show people how to actually use the most powerful force in the Universe would be detrimental to their plans to control all of us.  The closest thing I have ever seen to actual ""Light"" (of the Holy Spirit) being used to protect anyone in a film, was the Patronus Charm in the Harry Potter movies. Not the spirit animals, but the great shield of ""Light.""  They don't call it The Light, but that is basically what it is, and I was totally amazed and in awe the first time Harry was able to do it.  That was real magic, because the ""Light"" is very real, and does guide and protect, etc...

The boy in this movie has telekinetic abilities, but I have never seen that aspect of metaphysics handled WORSE than it was in this movie.  They missed a great opportunity to show his first discovery that he could move things with his mind, and then start to develop those abilities.  The movie Chronicle, for example, did an outstanding job of this.  It was really fascinating, and a truly great film.  In this dismal pointless mess, however, the very first time we see telekinesis happening, the boy is walking down some stairs, and a table knife starts moving around, they show the girl, and they show him, back and forth to the knife, the girl, the boy... And with completely wrong looks on both their faces, it is impossible to tell who is actually moving the knife.  He is such a BAD actor, that he doesn't even know how to look like he's focussing on moving a knife with his mind. And the director is so horribly awful that he obviously didn't give any guidance whatsoever to the kid.

My roommate said that there are several Seeker books, but the way they left this movie, it's not even possible to do a sequel.

I usually don't care for remakes and reboots, but THE SEEKER BOOKS NEED A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE REBOOT, WITH GOOD ACTORS AND A GREAT DIRECTOR.",1370649600,,3052,4.377659574468085

3009355,4,B000XUUQRE,"The Seeker(released Oct/07)is a nice adaption of one of the books from the Dark is Rising series by Susan Cooper. The film stars a young Canadian actor in the lead role of Will Stanton,Alexander Ludwig,who acquits himself quite well in his role. Accompanying him,among many others,is his dark nemesis Chris Eccleston,more famous for his Dr Who role and the always affable and multi talented Ian McShane,actor/director extraordinaire,as Merriman Lyon,one of Will's protectors.
The plot finds Will coming into his 14th year in England. He is the 7th son of a 7th son,and his father,mother,five brothers and one sister have moved to England,where they live in a large house in a small English town. However as his birthday comes and passes strange things start to happen:swarms of crows pester him at a bus stop,he gets picked up by security guards at a mall for shop lifting and he ends up fleeing from them as they ""turn"",two men in the village seem to know Will quite well,which isn't possible,or is it?,and other just as strange incidents. Will and his family attend,by invitation,a Christmas get together hosted by a local dowager at her English manor. While at the party a slightly older girl,but one whom he been smitten with,also arrives there. There she gives him the eyes,but it is one of his older brothers that walks away with her. Will goes outside,frustrated,then is chased down by two dark dogs and a man on a horse. The horseman tells him he wants the sign,and that if he doesn't give it to him a great darkness will descend upon the Earth in just five days. Suddenly the dowager,her man servant Merriman and the two men who knew him but whom he did not,appear and frighten the man off. They take him for a walk through time and explain as of his recent birthday,he has come of age. He is a seeker who must seek out all six signs in order to save the Earth from destruction.
The film from this point escalates little by little as time runs ever shorter and Will's quest to find each succeeding sign is fraught with extreme dangers. Of course the horseman dogs his every step trying to thwart his attempts at finding the signs,and even employes helpers to distract and aid him in getting the signs. But find them he does,or almost. The final confrontation comes in an old church where the horseman seems to have the upper hand,as the final sign is not seemingly within Will's grasp. All his protectors cannot save him as the darkness takes them away. As it inevitably takes Will away also,Will finally realizes the final sign is within him. He fights back and returns to the church to finally put the horseman to ""bed"".The film ends as Will and the twin brother he never knew(taken by the darkness years before),return home together.
The story is certainly a compelling one,the acting is right on,the script and pace are well done and the cinematography is top notch. The editing/plotline also keeps you guessing constantly throughout as to who might be working with the horseman,who is working with or against whom,who really knows more than they're telling,etc,etc. For all its nice special effects it is,above all,a well done mystery movie that will keep you absorbed from beginning to end.
Technically speaking this film is clear and crisp and is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1,along with it' full frame cousin on the flip side,i.e a dreaded double sided disc. Be careful not to scuff or scratch. There are no extras at all.
All in all a nice film about innocence come of age,who is thrust into circumstances beyond his control and is forced to push the envelope farther than he ever expected he would ever have to,to overcome overwhelming odds. Above all,and take note,there is not one WORD of swearing or off coloured humour in this film. This is a FAMILY FILM from top to bottom,and as such,gets an extra notch up in my books. They are so rare these days,that when one comes along like this of such good quality,it deserves all the backing one can give it. Recommended.",1345939200,,3982,4.739193083573487
3009366,5,B000XUUQRE,"First Amazon.com as always deliverd my purchase very quickly (2 days).

My opinion of this movie is that the movie is very entertaining without all the vulgarity that most films overdo these days.

I have read several reviews for this movie that I believe had missed the point, if you review this movie as a interpritation of the original book you may be correct, but the explanation for the film is a ""based upon"" storyline so the writters and direction can make a story of their own. Kind of reminds me back in the late 70's early 80's when music video's were beginning, I thought how cool it would be to have a video explaining the song, I was so mistaken as most video's didn't interpret the song one bit, so it is with movie's being based upon a original book.

I thought the movie was charming and contained great special effects. The movie will not become an epic, but is most entertaing.

High recommendations....",1325203200,,921,4.5636363636363635
3009367,2,B000XUUQRE,"Ms Cooper wrote a classic. An enchanting tale, very magical and although pure fantasy it had an inner logic. With many pointers to old legends, myth and lore, it was a great story of good versus evil and wisdom versus ambition.

I still believe that this series is a perfect script for a trilogy of movies, but somehow, in trying to make it a single movie and more ""modern"", the director managed to lose almost all magic.

It still has good moments and it's perfectly capable of entertaining a family for a couple of hours, but the odds are that this isn't a film you will remember fondly.

The action scenes are quite weak and the characters are substantially different than originally imagined...but this could be forgiven if it benefited the story. But unfortunately it became much more childish and nave.

There are fine interpretations, a fine Viking raid (the reenactors are very good), very good scenery and on location props, good FX, decent featurettes...it has so many merits that it would be so easy to make this film memorable. But it is just...average...without magic.",1320883200,,1081,4.827027027027027

3009369,1,B000XUUQRE,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a huge fan of Ms. Coopers books and was excited to see a  movie based on one of her books. Unfortunately, it was pretty much unwatchable. This review is on the first half of the movie, which I managed to force myself through. After that, I turned it off. From what I can see in the other reviews, that was a good choice.

The movie has made unneccessary changes to the plot of the book. None of these changes improved upon the book; in fact, just the opposite is true. Further, the story was so condensed that it was almost impossible to follow. Special effects were over-the-top and completely distracting.

I hope some day a good movie is made from the Dark is Rising series. Unfortunately, this is not it.",1296000000,,747,4.398550724637682
3009370,3,B000XUUQRE,"While I absolutely loved the book, and have reread it numerous times since discovering it...er, a number of years ago, I didn't exactly hate the movie as much as other fans of the book seem to have done. Sure, it seemed a bit weird and unnecessary to make the family American--and why did some of the brothers have British accents? Also the whole adolescent angst thing was way overplayed, and the love interest sort of subplot, and then  the whole lost twin thing...???? What was that all about? There was more than enough in the original book, the problem would be in deciding what to leave out, so I just don't get why they had to add all this new stuff. Totally unnecessary, and kind of distracting, but there was enough there from my beloved book to somewhat compensate. The fact that my 7-year-old son really liked it, too, raised my opinion of the movie a bit--he is not remotely interested in Harry Potter, although he did like the Narnia movies, so whatever it takes to get him to share some of my old favorites, I'm okay with.

The one thing we both could never really get past, though, was the fact that the kid who played Will Stanton had been the nastiest of the snotty Little League brats in Sandlot III, a movie that we have seen (along with Sandlots I and II) many, many times. Every time something bad happened to Will, we kept saying ""Serves you right for being a nasty little baseball cheat"". Bet Tommy Santorelli, David Durango or (especially) Benny the Jet Rodriguez would have made much better Seekers. Certainly less prone to standing around with that particularly stupid cow who's just been hit with a cattle prod expression on their faces, that's for sure. I hope little whatshisname goes on to a profitable carer in accounting or dentistry or plumbing or anything other than acting, as I don't particularly care to see him in any more movies.",1292976000,,1868,4.606606606606607

I've heard the two have very little in common, and I'm inclined to believe the report.

In terms of imagery, one can tell where the movie borrows from such sources as HARRY POTTER, LORD OF THE RINGS, and to a large degree, even THE MATRIX.

3009398,3,B000XUUQRE,"Seeker / B000XUUQRE

*Spoilers*

There's a lot of reviews online already from fans of the book series this movie is allegedly based upon, and the overall consensus seems to be that ""Seeker"" is a terrible film adaptation of a wonderful book series and that if you're only coming to this movie because you're a fan of the book, you should give it a miss, and I definitely respect that. I haven't read the book series yet (although it's definitely on my To-Do list), so this review will be of the movie itself, as it stands alone, without consideration for whether the adaptation was well done.

If you haven't read the books and are just looking for something mindless and wholesome to pass an evening with the kids, ""Seeker"" will fit the bill, but there's nothing here that you haven't seen before ad nauseum. My first viewing of ""Seeker"" was a resounding ""Eh"", but I had just recently had my socks completely blown off by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spiderwick-Chronicles/dp/B0017I04RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a>, and I thought perhaps my unenthusiasm for ""Seeker"" might have been at least in part because it paled in comparison. Having watched it again recently, however, with the same result, I just have to say that ""Seeker"" is tired, worn, and overdone at this point.

There seems to be some kind of children's' adventure movie boilerplate in Hollywood that gets stamped onto every book series out of the gate, now that ""Harry Potter"" has proved wildly successful, and the result is that far too many original and interesting books are turned into sore-fest MacGuffin quests. We saw it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139W3NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-Ember/dp/B001LPWGBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of Ember</a>, for example, and really with countless others that deserve a better fate. ""Seeker"" fits the bill - a destined child comes into his powers, hunts for the hidden MacGuffin items within the given time limit, and the bad guys and good guys have it out frequently in major battle scenes that seem to be written to fit the inevitable video game spin-off. Like I said, you've seen it all before.

Not that there's nothing worthwhile here. It's nice to see a strong and intelligent female guardian, somewhat modeled here after McGonagall from the ""Harry Potter"" movies, unless I miss my guess, and she's actually given a decent amount of screen time, pleasantly enough. It would be nice, for once, for movie parents to not be completely worthless piles of idiocy and brisk abrasiveness, but I'm a hopeless dreamer. If you just want something cheap and mindless to plop into your kids' laps, ""Seeker"" will fill the void after you've exhausted all the other children's' magical adventure movies, and I suppose the movie is better than the horrendously awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5-Children-It/dp/B0009S4ILA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5 Children & It</a>, but that's probably the faintest praise I've ever given in a review.

3009399,5,B000XUUQRE,"For people who are looking for this movie to be based on The Dark Is Rising series of boks it's a disappointment. Consider this movie to be loosely based on them with the plot and names the same but something completely different. Although it's loosely based this movie can stand on it's own and could be thought of as a companion to the books. A person doesn't have to read the series or even know what the books are about to enjoy this film. Actually, it's best NOT to compare the two.",1250553600,,487,4.304347826086956

Yes, they compressed a lot of stuff, over looked a lot, and seemed to be rushing it. But, as the series went on, it seemed to become closer to the books. I've read all the books so far and I can say that while it is not what I pictured - it is a viable depiction. For a TV show it does well and covers the topical points and powers with enough viability to make it worth watching. Yes, I pictured Richard and Catlin with more maturity but hey - I can go with the premise to attrack viewers. If it continues it will get better - Richard and Catlin have a long way to go and I  enjoy the journey with them.

3009401,1,B000XUUQRE,"Unfortunately, what I have to say about this movie has already been said and I can't add very much to the criticism. Like many others, I've never seen a book so ""dumbed down"" by its movie adaptation as this one. It really has to be the worst book adaptation ever put on-screen. They turned the story into an uninspiring and uninspired one of a boy finding out he has magical powers and that it's his job to save the world. (Does that remind you of anyone, incidentally?)  In this case the boy has to find six signs so he (with a little help from a few friends) can overcome the Dark. The plot had already been done when Susan Cooper wrote her book in the seventies and was even more well-worn when Rowling used it. Cooper's take on it was every bit as imaginative as Rowling's (in my opinion it was more imaginative) but everything that made her story so original was stripped away. At least Rowling's work didn't suffer such indignities.

I'm repeating the changes made to Cooper's story just in case readers aren't already aware of them:

* All the rhyming prophecies were stripped away

* The Walker was removed. In the book he gave Will the second sign--the ""bronze carried long""--and was to prove an important character in the series.

* The signs were changed. They were all simple circles quartered by a cross and were supposed to have each been made of specific materials: iron, bronze, wood, stone, fire and water:
""Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long;
Wood from the burning, stone out of song;
Fire in the candle-ring, water from the thaw;
Six Signs the circle, and the grail gone before.""
I suspect the producers' inspiration for making the last sign Will himself came from the Harry Potter series. It was NOT a good change. Viewers saw it coming anyway.

* All the Celtic myths on which the books were based were removed. No wonder the first book wasn't done!

* Merriman Lyon (Great Uncle Merry--or Gummerry--to the Drew children) lost his identity as Merlin the Enchanter. They might as well have changed his name while they were about it. They'd certainly have needed a different actor if they had kept his Merlin character because they couldn't have found a more unsuitable one than Ian McShane.

* Will belonged to a caring farming family, not the bickering urban one depicted. And he certainly wouldn't have used his growing powers against his family as in one scene where he threw one of his brothers up the stairs because he'd had enough of his taunting. In fact, use of his powers had to be kept secret and Will used them unnecessarily only once when, walking alone down Tramps' Alley in the snow, he called upon a dead, fallen branch to burn. You could hardly blame him; he'd only just discovered this power. Not to mention he was cold and hungry at the time and, as far as he was concerned, there was nobody around to see.

* The story was brought into the present. These books are ""period"" pieces now and should have been depicted that way. But the producers made sure we knew we were about to watch a movie set in the present day by shoving iPods and mobile phones galore at us in the opening scenes. Talk about going over the top! I felt as though I'd had them poked right into my eyes.

If THE DARK IS RISING Sequence had never been written and this film had therefore been ""original"" it still wouldn't have been good because it was all special effects and very little story. Cooper's books didn't need all these unnecessary special effects anyway. I would like to refer readers to an even older book that was turned into a TV series (six half-hour episodes) in 1984 by the BBC. That book is THE BOX OF DELIGHTS by John Masefield. The special effects in this were adequately done and, of course, the producers didn't have computer technology at their command. It's unfortunate that computer-generated effects always seem to tempt producers into going over the top. Even LORD OF THE RINGS wasn't proof against the temptation. But THE BOX OF DELIGHT series on DVD (running without breaks, just like a 3-hour movie) still makes riveting viewing. I defy a youngster of today not to enjoy it, for all its outdated special effects and the fact that it's set in the nineteen-thirties. The makers of THE SEEKER: THE DARK IS RISING might have learned a few things from watching THE BOX OF DELIGHTS.",1241049600,,4323,4.595330739299611

The film version STARTS as a possible heartfelt family drama-adventure - a charming but serious-undertoned fantasy about the age old subject of Good vs. Evil - 'Light vs. Dark.' But soon it's drowning in testosterone-driven action; the pugilistic teenage male characters and their 'toughness' quickly dominate the story, overpowering the mystery and wonderment of otherwise good fantasy. This is not by any stretch anywhere near Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter!
Action and special effects in The Seeker appeared just thrown-together -- spoiler alert -- giving the film's middle and end sections a wildly chaotic look. Also, how many times in one movie can you use the now very tired effect of knocking down or blowing away a character in slow motion? Typically I'm not a prude about these things, but there seemed an awful lot of all kinds of violence for an '8yr+' film. No nuance, no wonderment, no charm, no finesse; only wilted mystery, stilted displays of family affection and broad disjointed violence disguised as action.",1234656000,,1101,4.989130434782608

But the movie was poorly done, and I am sure that we can blame a majority of that on a poorly written script.

Now that I have read them, in my opinion, it is unfortunate that the film makers didn't start at the beginning (Over Sea and Under Stone) and tell this remarkable story over the course of several films. Maybe that way they would or could have stayed closer to the story told in the books.

My advice to you is to enjoy this movie as a stand alone flick that is VERY loosely tied to ""The Dark Is Rising"" book. Then, read (or reread) The Dark Is Rising Sequence to get the whole thrilling and very lovely story that Susan Cooper crafted so well.",1232409600,,848,4.333333333333333

Most of the movie adaptations have turned out good to great; but there is the occasional stinker, and this probably counts as the stinker of 2007.

The premise...

Dark and light battle. Dark wins. Light survives. Dark falters. Light wins. Darkness may still be out there waiting to win again. Cool CGI. Actors saying stilted and ridiculous lines. Corny ending. Close curtain.

That's it. Really.

Alexander Ludwig stars as Will Stanton, the final ""seeker"" in a line of immortals who's job it is is to seek out and find the signs that will unlock a puzzle responsible for defeating ""The Darkness."" The darkness is given form by The Rider (Christopher Eccleston,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-TV-Series/dp/B001B7CNWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes TV Series</a>) who's goal is to trick The Seeker and get the clues himself so that he can snuff out the light. The battles to and fro are not surprising and have little if any impact on the viewer. Some casually decent CGI makes for some interesting shots but it's all show with no substance.

References to other great fantasy films are easily paralleled. Most notably is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;with its own ""dark riders"" and their need to find ""the one ring"". Friends surround Frodo to protect him from this dangerous item (similar to how friends protect Will Stanton so that he can complete his own journey). But The Lord of the Rings had some of the best CGI, best acting, and best directing out there. The Seeker failed on almost all of those.

I'm sure every actor in this lame film are praying it'll vanish, like a fantasy that never was. Let's help them out by not watching it.",1223337600,,1903,5.590277777777778

The film is okay, but when you realize they clipped and cut the heart and soul out of six novels to produce this vaguely forgettable film, moving the wonder the humor and the heart out of it and left very little behind to wonder what motivates and propels the story along.

The books are better. Read them. Ignore this cinematic travesty. If the film were any good, it wouldn't be found dumped heavily in the discount bins after its DVD release...",1220745600,,539,4.5
3009447,1,B000XUUQRE,"First, I will reiterate that if you are a fan of Susan Cooper's novel, avoid this film unless you want a huge disappointment.  First, the filmmakers chose to leave out all references to British mythology which were so central to the novel. Second, they made multiple unnecessary changes to the characters and plot, such as making the main character American rather than English, as American kids *obviously* can't relate to a British character. (Yes, I'm being sarcastic.)

Without reference to the book, this was sadly still mediocre kids' fare. There are several reasons that I thought this film failed as a stand-alone:

* Will, the main character, is a little brat.
OK, that wasn't very sympathetic, but he irritated me.  He spends a large quantity of time whining that he doesn't want to be the Seeker, and throws a spectacularly destructive magical tantrum to which his mentor calmly responds ""He's expressing himself.""  (Great lesson for the kiddies!  If you want to express yourself, blow something up!) By the climax, he gets cocky and brags about his special status, which is just as annoying.

* The plot was ill-conceived.
By stripping out the mythology that was so important to the novel, the film also strips out anything that gave depth to the plot.  The result is a simple treasure hunt, but one that doesn't have many clues ala National Treasure to keep you guessing.  While going about his everyday business, Will just randomly sees a vision of a spiral pattern, then hunts around until he finds the Sign hidden in the vicinity.  There are also some gaping holes in the plot.  In one scene Will's little sister gets inadvertently introduced to his magical world, but never seems to question the experience or bring it up to other family members.  Did Will use magic to make her forget?  If he did, it wasn't shown in the movie.

*  The climax was boring and ridiculous.
The final ""battle"" was a downright boring affair with lots of heavily stylized camera work and little action.  The Big Bad Rider seemed strangely easily intimidated by a 14-year old boy and his bragging.  I won't detail the final plot-twists for people who want to see the movie, but suffice to say that they left more unanswered questions that stretch suspended disbelief to the breaking point.

In sum, this movie played as a cheap, hole-ridden Harry Potter knock-off.  This might be good movie to rent for kids roughly in the ""tween"" age range or a little younger, provided they like fantasy and haven't read the books.  Some of the scenes may be a little scary for very young children.  The over-simplified and unconvincing plot will likely put off older teens and adults.  The Harry Potter franchise and some other recent films have upped the ante in making family fantasy films that are truly for the whole family - complex and interesting enough to entertain adults as well as children.  I would argue that it has also raised expectations that book adaptations be reasonably faithful to the source material.  The Seeker fails on both accounts.",1219536000,,3038,4.843023255813954
3009448,4,B000XUUQRE,"Whether or not you agree with the film's adaptation of the book series, The Seeker is a well-made piece of film art.  I was impressed with the cinematography and the use of angles and lenses to heighten the feelings of the protagonist as he discovers his destiny and struggles with it.  Lighting was also masterful in this film, as it should be in a film about the struggle between light and dark.  The only qualm I had was with Christopher Eccleston: he gave a rather stilted performance as The Rider.  If you are a great fan of the books, try to disengage your criticism and simply enjoy the film for its own art form.",1217980800,,620,4.412280701754386
3009449,3,B000XUUQRE,"Individual performances by the actors are pretty good here, though somehow the lead comes across as a little overdone and not believable at the end when the young Will Stanton realizes the origin of the sixth sign and takes a dramatic verbal stand against the Dark.

What is nice about this movie is the way it starts out with normal kids in a normal world and then introduces little elements of fantasy bit by bit into that normal world.  The local character parts are nicely acted, though Ian McShane's character does not get much of a chance to really develop and is limited in range, which is really too bad given the power of McShane.

Where I suspect people will find this one loses them is in the final third of the movie, when suddenly some of the characters go through changes that are not well explained and the magical world intrudes on the regular world with a ferocity that demands more of an explanation at the end of the movie than is given.  In other words, at the very end many people are likely to say, ""Hey, wait a minute, how do we understand or how come no one is talking about X and Y?""

I wish they had done more with the Old People and toned down the ending.

Still, while it is not as slick as Harry Potter, the first third of the movie did a better job than HP of making us believe magic could exist hidden alongside everyday reality.  It also does not have the corney stereotypes and kid humor of HP, something a viewer may or may not appreciate.

I wanted to like it more, but in fairness, it is a 3 star movie at best.  Somehow the elements did not all come together on this one.",1217980800,,1608,4.2805280528052805

Ian McShane who was nominated for an Emmy for TV's ""Deadwood"" in 2005 is perhaps the hardest to figure out as Merriman Lyon.

3009469,2,B000XUUQRE,"There was definitely some talent involved in the making of this film.  A lot of the camera work is very creative, unusual angles are effectively used in many scenes (including brief cuts with it being upside down that are subtle enough not to be easily noticed!).

However, the creativity seemed to run short in a lot of ways.  A lot of the shots of the 'rider' were slightly reminiscent of the Nazgul in the Lord of the Rings, particularly the times when he is mounted.  Additionally, while the style used to establish the mood around the 'rider' was effective in the beginning, it did not vary much over the course of the movie, and thus began to feel stale by the end.  The director also could not seem to resist the urge to slow down action shots in 'Matrix' style.

As for the acting, Alexander Ludwig does a good job as Will Stanton.  Christopher Eccleston is a very talented actor, and seems to be holding back in this movie, somehow, or not quite on his game, which is rather disappointing (maybe he dislikes Romania).

Now, the biggie: the story.  All in all, I have to rate this by far as one of the weakest book adaptations that I have seen (ok, the Scifi Channel adaptation of 'A Wizard of Earthsea' was FAR worse).  That does not mean it is a terrible movie though.  The book is of a high enough quality that even this watered down, very loose adaptation of it still has some merit.

What is difficult for me to understand though is that the novel was saturated with the myths and traditions of the british isles, and that whole feeling is entirely removed from the movie.  Some have suggested that this was because the director felt these were in opposition to his Christian beliefs (which seems odd as King Arthur is universally portrayed as a Christian).  The signs were originally all in the shape of celtic crosses, for instance, and the last great battle which the movie places as '1000 years ago' was, in the book, the battle of baden hill with King Arthur (and Merriman Lyon actually being Merlin), etc. This is all removed, and the movie could just as easily have taken place in Romania, where they filmed it.

The biggest problem that I had though is that instead of him being part of something bigger than himself in the battle against the dark, this telling of it has the other 'Old Ones' have to resort to cross bows and swords, because they seem to have virtually no power of their own.  Not only does this lack literary sense, it also has the effect of making much of the movie feel like a superhero-worship film, instead of an epic, large scale battle which is much more.  Will becomes this embodiment of light, placed opposite the 'rider', who was the embodiment of the dark.  This one-on-one situation might appeal to modern movie audiences, but just serves to be reductionist and effectively VASTLY limits both what the light and the dark are.

The sub-plot about his father being a physicist who had studied the actual nature of light and dark struck me as a total non-sequitur, which did little to nothing to enhance the story and just sucked up time which should have been used in more meaningful character development.

Another sore thumb is that members of his family get carried on his time journeys with him, and he doesn't just wipe their memory (a power old ones have in the book) afterwards.  Aside from being weirded out at the moment, the subject never comes up again as it would in reality.

The ending was particuarly painful. What was, in the past, an epic battle between light and dark which the light barely won, was a quick and trite utter dominion of the dark by will (without the aid of any of the other old ones, annoyingly enough). I was just like, the whole movie has been leading to this moment, AND THAT IS IT?

Overall, not a total failure, but definitely not the inspiring triumph that the book is.  It would be enjoyed a lot by people in the 8-14 range, in particular.  It is not really an adult film, although adults with a particular love of fantasy, who have not read the book, would be likely to enjoy it as well.",1214006400,,4077,4.514285714285714

They shouldn't have bothered! This film is an offensive travesty with no resemblance to the book at all with the exception that the signs need to be collected. The casting of some little snotbag of an actor as Will is unforgivable along with all the other additions, subtractions & general 'creative liscence' that was taken.

I wish I could give this movie no stars or better yet make it go away all together. Anyone who is a fan of Cooper's books will be sparing themselves some serious anger issues if they avoid this miserable piece of crap altogether.",1213488000,,779,4.47887323943662

The movie they named The Seeker: the dark is rising has so little in common with the book it should have had a different title.  I hate how everyone says that Will is just this poor boy that suddenly realizes he has powers. Did anyone read the book? He is an old one, once he becomes an old one he is no longer a little boy in possession of these powers he doesn't know how to control, he is an immortal being, whose very existence was created to stop the dark and allow mankind to live their own life. He isn't a confused little boy trying to find signs he doesn't really understand the meaning of. He doesn't have fits of rage, and teenage hormonal angst where he sets fire to things. And merrimen was a joke! This man is supposed to be the oldest of the old ones, and his mentor. Not some dumb butler who happens to know nothing about boys and need to be led by the hand by old Mrs. Greythorne (don't even get me started on her).
Overall I thought the plot was dumb (Tom is Will's lost twin brother who was locked in this weird sphere for most of his life what???), the special effects were dull, and the whole movie laughable.

3009473,1,B000XUUQRE,"If anyone is familiar with the history of The Seeker's production, you already know that it was very loosely adapted from the books by a fundamentalist director.  Besides the issue that Will suddenly was made older & ""modernised"", the adaptation completely missed the point of the book series.  The books were definately written for children rather for an all ages audience (the story is not necessarily about the ""hero's journey"" or ""coming of age"" issues, but rather about young children trying to understand unexplained forces & issues of the world through mysterious events, magic & adventure), but they did have some interesting comments on children grappling with different forces of the world.  This film simplifies and changes the main concepts and has among the most uninteresting dialogues I've heard, very poor character development & predictable plot.  (if I wanted to see a Christian-themed fantasy, I'd rather see the Narnia films, even with all their faults or watch LOTR or The Exorcist again).

It's one of the worst movie adaptations I have seen since the Earthsea Chronicles.  I rented it even though I read bad reviews, but wanted to give this film a chance since I love this subgenre so much.  I gave it one star for the presence of Christopher Eccleston.

A film does not have to be an exact adaptation, but should still carry forth the basic essence of the novel that is being adapted.

If you are in the mood to see some fun fantasy film based on good books, there is so much to choose from, such as the Harry Potter series, the European version/television series of Wrinkle in Time, Stardust, Spiderwick Chronicles (could have been better dialogue, but some of the characters are very charming), The Water Horse (surprisingly one of the best children's book adaptations of 2007) and Golden Compass (very Hollywood, but can be good depending on the next film).",1211500800,,1884,4.936708860759493

Sadly, I was very disappointed.

Rather than following the life and excitement of these wonderful books, the director/producer/whoever took the cheap and easy road, creating a middle of the road, predictable story ... or worse. The ""Old Ones"" are one dimensional caricatures of Harry Potter characters, the seductive witch virtually ignores the entire feminist movement, and the storyline has needless updates with webcams and ipods.

Too bad, really. The young man who played Will had a fair level of screen presence ... he is a young man with potential.

What captured me initially about Ms. Cooper's wonderful stories was, similar to J.K. Rowling, her impression command of British mythology ... parts of the story that were sterilized out of the movie in order to create a story-line with a modern-day narcissistic plot (gee ... guess who is the final sign?!?)

3009507,2,B000XUUQRE,"I have read and re-read Susan Cooper's ""The Dark is Rising"" many times since I first discovered it in the late 1970s. It is a wonderful book, one of my top ten all-time favorites, and so is the series. This movie is only very loosely based on the book, and is, in and of itself, a bad movie whether you have read the book or not.

If you have read the book, you will be horrified at how many needless changes were made to the plot and characters.

If you have not read the book, you will be confused because you won't know what is really going on.

I never expect a movie version fo a book to follow the book exactly, but it should at least keep the important aspects of a story. This movie does not. It tears away many of the very best things of the book, and alters what little is left so badly that it darkens the story where there should have been light (such as in the relationships among the Stanton children).

It doesn't help that, despite some excellent actors, everyone was miscast, and some of the most important characters (Will and Merriman especially) are made into such horrible characters that one might weep at the wreckage.

The worst thing is that, after seeing this movie, people who have never read the book might avoid it, thinking it is as chaotic, confusing, and unsatisfactory as the movie. The book, and the other books in the series, are well worth reading no matter what your age.

Plot summary: The basic story is that of Will, a boy who comes into his spiritual inheritance as being the last-born of the ""Old Ones,"" mysterious guardians who have been shepherding and aiding humanity in its fight against the Dark (the powers of evil) for millenia. When an Old One is born, he or she does not remember being an Old One. Old Ones must be reminded of their true natures by reading a magical book on or shortly after their 11th birthday (the age is changed to 14 in the movie). That is one of the tasks Will must accomplish in this story.

Another task is for Will to retrieve six signs of power that can be used to help fight against the Dark. He needs to move through time to accomplish his tasks. In the book, the six signs are actual physical objects; in the movie, one of the horrible changes made is that the sixth sign is Will himself (I am not spoiling anything here--you know that this is so as soon as they say, ""the sixth sign isn't hidden"").

Of course, the agents of the Dark do all within their power to stop Will from remembering who he truly is and from recovering all six signs.

That's the gist of both the book and the movie. This summary does not convey how evocative and magical Ms. Coooper's book is, and how very much the opposite the movie is. Will especially is made into such an unlikable character--pouty, bratty, sullen, and, when he gets his powers, ready to flaunt them and throw his weight around with them instead of handling them wisely as even a young Old One would do--that I wonder how anyone can like him or care much for what happens to him.

If you have not watched this movie, don't. Instead, buy Ms. Cooper's books and give yourself some highly enjoyable hours of reading.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Is-Rising-Boxed-Set-The-Dark-Is-Rising-Greenwitch-Over-Sea-Under-Stone-Silver-on-the-Tree-The-Grey-King/dp/1416949968/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Is Rising (Boxed Set): The Dark Is Rising, Greenwitch, Over Sea, Under Stone, Silver on the Tree, The Grey King</a>",1207094400,,3493,4.758677685950413

Will is a special Old One, not only because he is the last Old One, but because he is also the Seeker--the person chosen to seek and find six Signs of Power (in the shape of a circle with a cross).  When united the signs form a great weapon to fight the Dark.  Will, however, only has a few days to find and united the Signs before the Dark Rider (Christopher Eccleston) and his minions reach the height of their power and will be able to overcome and withstand even the power of the united Signs.

THE SEEKER is based upon Susan Cooper's beloved novel, THE DARK IS RISING.  However, other than a few names, locations, and sparse plot outline, THE SEEKER has no semblance to THE DARK IS RISING.  For example, Will is turned from a British boy into an American, the character of the Walker is erased, and there is no hunt.  I'm a huge fan of Susan Cooper's stories and when I learned about THE SEEKER, I was quite excited about it, but I was extremely disappointed by the movie adaptation.  That's not to say the movie is terrible, because it's not.  It is a decent escapist fantasy flick that, as a movie, isn't too bad.  It is, however, a very, very,  poor adaptation of the story it is based upon.  All of the Celtic mythology, sense of magic, and powerful spiritualism that are such an integral part of Cooper's novel have been eliminated.  The result is a decent fantasy movie that's entertaining to watch, but that fails to spark the imagination or encourage the heart and doesn't have much spirit.",1201478400,,1927,4.558139534883721

3243845,1,B000XUUQRE,"Dull mess with no magic that totally dishonors the book it came from and the author who wrote it!

I didn't read the book, but my roommate did, and he said the same thing about The Seeker that people are saying on this and other sites...

The director, writer, and producers of this movie didn't really follow the book at all, and definitely did Not improve on it.  In fact, they totally RUINED it!

Since I didn't read the book, I will just comment on what I noticed is wrong with the film itself...

The story is supposedly a battle between ""the Light"" and the dark. ""The Light"" itself is something that is hardly ever talked about in movies or TV shows, so I thought it would be very cool, but in this movie it is portrayed 100% wrong.  The one time the kid actually uses ""the Light"" all we see is a regular fire on the floor.  ""The Light"" is Not flames.  It is actually Light (yes, in another dimension, but actually Light), and they missed an opportunity to show how powerful it can be, and how people can use it to protect themselves and be guided by it, etc... but that's probably the point, isn't it?  The backers of Hollywood films allow the makers of the films to go so far with metaphysics, but to show people how to actually use the most powerful force in the Universe would be detrimental to their plans to control all of us.  The closest thing I have ever seen to actual ""Light"" (of the Holy Spirit) being used to protect anyone in a film, was the Patronus Charm in the Harry Potter movies. Not the spirit animals, but the great shield of ""Light.""  They don't call it The Light, but that is basically what it is, and I was totally amazed and in awe the first time Harry was able to do it.  That was real magic, because the ""Light"" is very real, and does guide and protect, etc...

The boy in this movie has telekinetic abilities, but I have never seen that aspect of metaphysics handled WORSE than it was in this movie.  They missed a great opportunity to show his first discovery that he could move things with his mind, and then start to develop those abilities.  The movie Chronicle, for example, did an outstanding job of this.  It was really fascinating, and a truly great film.  In this dismal pointless mess, however, the very first time we see telekinesis happening, the boy is walking down some stairs, and a table knife starts moving around, they show the girl, and they show him, back and forth to the knife, the girl, the boy... And with completely wrong looks on both their faces, it is impossible to tell who is actually moving the knife.  He is such a BAD actor, that he doesn't even know how to look like he's focussing on moving a knife with his mind. And the director is so horribly awful that he obviously didn't give any guidance whatsoever to the kid.

My roommate said that there are several Seeker books, but the way they left this movie, it's not even possible to do a sequel.

I usually don't care for remakes and reboots, but THE SEEKER BOOKS NEED A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE REBOOT, WITH GOOD ACTORS AND A GREAT DIRECTOR.",1370649600,,3052,4.377659574468085

3243852,4,B000XUUQRE,"The Seeker(released Oct/07)is a nice adaption of one of the books from the Dark is Rising series by Susan Cooper. The film stars a young Canadian actor in the lead role of Will Stanton,Alexander Ludwig,who acquits himself quite well in his role. Accompanying him,among many others,is his dark nemesis Chris Eccleston,more famous for his Dr Who role and the always affable and multi talented Ian McShane,actor/director extraordinaire,as Merriman Lyon,one of Will's protectors.
The plot finds Will coming into his 14th year in England. He is the 7th son of a 7th son,and his father,mother,five brothers and one sister have moved to England,where they live in a large house in a small English town. However as his birthday comes and passes strange things start to happen:swarms of crows pester him at a bus stop,he gets picked up by security guards at a mall for shop lifting and he ends up fleeing from them as they ""turn"",two men in the village seem to know Will quite well,which isn't possible,or is it?,and other just as strange incidents. Will and his family attend,by invitation,a Christmas get together hosted by a local dowager at her English manor. While at the party a slightly older girl,but one whom he been smitten with,also arrives there. There she gives him the eyes,but it is one of his older brothers that walks away with her. Will goes outside,frustrated,then is chased down by two dark dogs and a man on a horse. The horseman tells him he wants the sign,and that if he doesn't give it to him a great darkness will descend upon the Earth in just five days. Suddenly the dowager,her man servant Merriman and the two men who knew him but whom he did not,appear and frighten the man off. They take him for a walk through time and explain as of his recent birthday,he has come of age. He is a seeker who must seek out all six signs in order to save the Earth from destruction.
The film from this point escalates little by little as time runs ever shorter and Will's quest to find each succeeding sign is fraught with extreme dangers. Of course the horseman dogs his every step trying to thwart his attempts at finding the signs,and even employes helpers to distract and aid him in getting the signs. But find them he does,or almost. The final confrontation comes in an old church where the horseman seems to have the upper hand,as the final sign is not seemingly within Will's grasp. All his protectors cannot save him as the darkness takes them away. As it inevitably takes Will away also,Will finally realizes the final sign is within him. He fights back and returns to the church to finally put the horseman to ""bed"".The film ends as Will and the twin brother he never knew(taken by the darkness years before),return home together.
The story is certainly a compelling one,the acting is right on,the script and pace are well done and the cinematography is top notch. The editing/plotline also keeps you guessing constantly throughout as to who might be working with the horseman,who is working with or against whom,who really knows more than they're telling,etc,etc. For all its nice special effects it is,above all,a well done mystery movie that will keep you absorbed from beginning to end.
Technically speaking this film is clear and crisp and is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1,along with it' full frame cousin on the flip side,i.e a dreaded double sided disc. Be careful not to scuff or scratch. There are no extras at all.
All in all a nice film about innocence come of age,who is thrust into circumstances beyond his control and is forced to push the envelope farther than he ever expected he would ever have to,to overcome overwhelming odds. Above all,and take note,there is not one WORD of swearing or off coloured humour in this film. This is a FAMILY FILM from top to bottom,and as such,gets an extra notch up in my books. They are so rare these days,that when one comes along like this of such good quality,it deserves all the backing one can give it. Recommended.",1345939200,,3982,4.739193083573487

My opinion of this movie is that the movie is very entertaining without all the vulgarity that most films overdo these days.

I have read several reviews for this movie that I believe had missed the point, if you review this movie as a interpritation of the original book you may be correct, but the explanation for the film is a ""based upon"" storyline so the writters and direction can make a story of their own. Kind of reminds me back in the late 70's early 80's when music video's were beginning, I thought how cool it would be to have a video explaining the song, I was so mistaken as most video's didn't interpret the song one bit, so it is with movie's being based upon a original book.

I thought the movie was charming and contained great special effects. The movie will not become an epic, but is most entertaing.

I still believe that this series is a perfect script for a trilogy of movies, but somehow, in trying to make it a single movie and more ""modern"", the director managed to lose almost all magic.

It still has good moments and it's perfectly capable of entertaining a family for a couple of hours, but the odds are that this isn't a film you will remember fondly.

The action scenes are quite weak and the characters are substantially different than originally imagined...but this could be forgiven if it benefited the story. But unfortunately it became much more childish and nave.

There are fine interpretations, a fine Viking raid (the reenactors are very good), very good scenery and on location props, good FX, decent featurettes...it has so many merits that it would be so easy to make this film memorable.

The movie has made unneccessary changes to the plot of the book. None of these changes improved upon the book; in fact, just the opposite is true. Further, the story was so condensed that it was almost impossible to follow. Special effects were over-the-top and completely distracting.

Sure, it seemed a bit weird and unnecessary to make the family American--and why did some of the brothers have British accents? Also the whole adolescent angst thing was way overplayed, and the love interest sort of subplot, and then  the whole lost twin thing...???? What was that all about? There was more than enough in the original book, the problem would be in deciding what to leave out, so I just don't get why they had to add all this new stuff. Totally unnecessary, and kind of distracting, but there was enough there from my beloved book to somewhat compensate. The fact that my 7-year-old son really liked it, too, raised my opinion of the movie a bit--he is not remotely interested in Harry Potter, although he did like the Narnia movies, so whatever it takes to get him to share some of my old favorites, I'm okay with.

The one thing we both could never really get past, though, was the fact that the kid who played Will Stanton had been the nastiest of the snotty Little League brats in Sandlot III, a movie that we have seen (along with Sandlots I and II) many, many times. Every time something bad happened to Will, we kept saying ""Serves you right for being a nasty little baseball cheat"". Bet Tommy Santorelli, David Durango or (especially) Benny the Jet Rodriguez would have made much better Seekers. Certainly less prone to standing around with that particularly stupid cow who's just been hit with a cattle prod expression on their faces, that's for sure.

*Spoilers*

There's a lot of reviews online already from fans of the book series this movie is allegedly based upon, and the overall consensus seems to be that ""Seeker"" is a terrible film adaptation of a wonderful book series and that if you're only coming to this movie because you're a fan of the book, you should give it a miss, and I definitely respect that. I haven't read the book series yet (although it's definitely on my To-Do list), so this review will be of the movie itself, as it stands alone, without consideration for whether the adaptation was well done.

If you haven't read the books and are just looking for something mindless and wholesome to pass an evening with the kids, ""Seeker"" will fit the bill, but there's nothing here that you haven't seen before ad nauseum. My first viewing of ""Seeker"" was a resounding ""Eh"", but I had just recently had my socks completely blown off by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spiderwick-Chronicles/dp/B0017I04RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a>, and I thought perhaps my unenthusiasm for ""Seeker"" might have been at least in part because it paled in comparison. Having watched it again recently, however, with the same result, I just have to say that ""Seeker"" is tired, worn, and overdone at this point.

There seems to be some kind of children's' adventure movie boilerplate in Hollywood that gets stamped onto every book series out of the gate, now that ""Harry Potter"" has proved wildly successful, and the result is that far too many original and interesting books are turned into sore-fest MacGuffin quests. We saw it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Compass/dp/B00139W3NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Compass</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-Ember/dp/B001LPWGBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of Ember</a>, for example, and really with countless others that deserve a better fate. ""Seeker"" fits the bill - a destined child comes into his powers, hunts for the hidden MacGuffin items within the given time limit, and the bad guys and good guys have it out frequently in major battle scenes that seem to be written to fit the inevitable video game spin-off. Like I said, you've seen it all before.

Not that there's nothing worthwhile here. It's nice to see a strong and intelligent female guardian, somewhat modeled here after McGonagall from the ""Harry Potter"" movies, unless I miss my guess, and she's actually given a decent amount of screen time, pleasantly enough. It would be nice, for once, for movie parents to not be completely worthless piles of idiocy and brisk abrasiveness, but I'm a hopeless dreamer. If you just want something cheap and mindless to plop into your kids' laps, ""Seeker"" will fill the void after you've exhausted all the other children's' magical adventure movies, and I suppose the movie is better than the horrendously awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/5-Children-It/dp/B0009S4ILA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">5 Children & It</a>, but that's probably the faintest praise I've ever given in a review.

Yes, they compressed a lot of stuff, over looked a lot, and seemed to be rushing it. But, as the series went on, it seemed to become closer to the books. I've read all the books so far and I can say that while it is not what I pictured - it is a viable depiction. For a TV show it does well and covers the topical points and powers with enough viability to make it worth watching. Yes, I pictured Richard and Catlin with more maturity but hey - I can go with the premise to attrack viewers. If it continues it will get better - Richard and Catlin have a long way to go and I  enjoy the journey with them.

3243898,1,B000XUUQRE,"Unfortunately, what I have to say about this movie has already been said and I can't add very much to the criticism. Like many others, I've never seen a book so ""dumbed down"" by its movie adaptation as this one. It really has to be the worst book adaptation ever put on-screen. They turned the story into an uninspiring and uninspired one of a boy finding out he has magical powers and that it's his job to save the world. (Does that remind you of anyone, incidentally?)  In this case the boy has to find six signs so he (with a little help from a few friends) can overcome the Dark. The plot had already been done when Susan Cooper wrote her book in the seventies and was even more well-worn when Rowling used it. Cooper's take on it was every bit as imaginative as Rowling's (in my opinion it was more imaginative) but everything that made her story so original was stripped away. At least Rowling's work didn't suffer such indignities.

I'm repeating the changes made to Cooper's story just in case readers aren't already aware of them:

* All the rhyming prophecies were stripped away

* The Walker was removed. In the book he gave Will the second sign--the ""bronze carried long""--and was to prove an important character in the series.

* The signs were changed. They were all simple circles quartered by a cross and were supposed to have each been made of specific materials: iron, bronze, wood, stone, fire and water:
""Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long;
Wood from the burning, stone out of song;
Fire in the candle-ring, water from the thaw;
Six Signs the circle, and the grail gone before.""
I suspect the producers' inspiration for making the last sign Will himself came from the Harry Potter series. It was NOT a good change. Viewers saw it coming anyway.

* All the Celtic myths on which the books were based were removed. No wonder the first book wasn't done!

* Merriman Lyon (Great Uncle Merry--or Gummerry--to the Drew children) lost his identity as Merlin the Enchanter. They might as well have changed his name while they were about it. They'd certainly have needed a different actor if they had kept his Merlin character because they couldn't have found a more unsuitable one than Ian McShane.

* Will belonged to a caring farming family, not the bickering urban one depicted. And he certainly wouldn't have used his growing powers against his family as in one scene where he threw one of his brothers up the stairs because he'd had enough of his taunting. In fact, use of his powers had to be kept secret and Will used them unnecessarily only once when, walking alone down Tramps' Alley in the snow, he called upon a dead, fallen branch to burn. You could hardly blame him; he'd only just discovered this power. Not to mention he was cold and hungry at the time and, as far as he was concerned, there was nobody around to see.

* The story was brought into the present. These books are ""period"" pieces now and should have been depicted that way. But the producers made sure we knew we were about to watch a movie set in the present day by shoving iPods and mobile phones galore at us in the opening scenes. Talk about going over the top! I felt as though I'd had them poked right into my eyes.

If THE DARK IS RISING Sequence had never been written and this film had therefore been ""original"" it still wouldn't have been good because it was all special effects and very little story. Cooper's books didn't need all these unnecessary special effects anyway. I would like to refer readers to an even older book that was turned into a TV series (six half-hour episodes) in 1984 by the BBC. That book is THE BOX OF DELIGHTS by John Masefield. The special effects in this were adequately done and, of course, the producers didn't have computer technology at their command. It's unfortunate that computer-generated effects always seem to tempt producers into going over the top. Even LORD OF THE RINGS wasn't proof against the temptation. But THE BOX OF DELIGHT series on DVD (running without breaks, just like a 3-hour movie) still makes riveting viewing. I defy a youngster of today not to enjoy it, for all its outdated special effects and the fact that it's set in the nineteen-thirties. The makers of THE SEEKER: THE DARK IS RISING might have learned a few things from watching THE BOX OF DELIGHTS.",1241049600,,4323,4.595330739299611

The film version STARTS as a possible heartfelt family drama-adventure - a charming but serious-undertoned fantasy about the age old subject of Good vs. Evil - 'Light vs. Dark.' But soon it's drowning in testosterone-driven action; the pugilistic teenage male characters and their 'toughness' quickly dominate the story, overpowering the mystery and wonderment of otherwise good fantasy. This is not by any stretch anywhere near Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter!
Action and special effects in The Seeker appeared just thrown-together -- spoiler alert -- giving the film's middle and end sections a wildly chaotic look. Also, how many times in one movie can you use the now very tired effect of knocking down or blowing away a character in slow motion? Typically I'm not a prude about these things, but there seemed an awful lot of all kinds of violence for an '8yr+' film.

Now that I have read them, in my opinion, it is unfortunate that the film makers didn't start at the beginning (Over Sea and Under Stone) and tell this remarkable story over the course of several films. Maybe that way they would or could have stayed closer to the story told in the books.

The premise...

Dark and light battle. Dark wins. Light survives. Dark falters. Light wins. Darkness may still be out there waiting to win again. Cool CGI. Actors saying stilted and ridiculous lines. Corny ending. Close curtain.

That's it. Really.

Alexander Ludwig stars as Will Stanton, the final ""seeker"" in a line of immortals who's job it is is to seek out and find the signs that will unlock a puzzle responsible for defeating ""The Darkness."" The darkness is given form by The Rider (Christopher Eccleston,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-TV-Series/dp/B001B7CNWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes TV Series</a>) who's goal is to trick The Seeker and get the clues himself so that he can snuff out the light. The battles to and fro are not surprising and have little if any impact on the viewer. Some casually decent CGI makes for some interesting shots but it's all show with no substance.

References to other great fantasy films are easily paralleled. Most notably is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;with its own ""dark riders"" and their need to find ""the one ring"". Friends surround Frodo to protect him from this dangerous item (similar to how friends protect Will Stanton so that he can complete his own journey). But The Lord of the Rings had some of the best CGI, best acting, and best directing out there. The Seeker failed on almost all of those.

I'm sure every actor in this lame film are praying it'll vanish, like a fantasy that never was. Let's help them out by not watching it.",1223337600,,1903,5.590277777777778

The film is okay, but when you realize they clipped and cut the heart and soul out of six novels to produce this vaguely forgettable film, moving the wonder the humor and the heart out of it and left very little behind to wonder what motivates and propels the story along.

The books are better. Read them. Ignore this cinematic travesty. If the film were any good, it wouldn't be found dumped heavily in the discount bins after its DVD release...",1220745600,,539,4.5
3243944,1,B000XUUQRE,"First, I will reiterate that if you are a fan of Susan Cooper's novel, avoid this film unless you want a huge disappointment.  First, the filmmakers chose to leave out all references to British mythology which were so central to the novel. Second, they made multiple unnecessary changes to the characters and plot, such as making the main character American rather than English, as American kids *obviously* can't relate to a British character. (Yes, I'm being sarcastic.)

Without reference to the book, this was sadly still mediocre kids' fare. There are several reasons that I thought this film failed as a stand-alone:

* Will, the main character, is a little brat.
OK, that wasn't very sympathetic, but he irritated me.  He spends a large quantity of time whining that he doesn't want to be the Seeker, and throws a spectacularly destructive magical tantrum to which his mentor calmly responds ""He's expressing himself.""  (Great lesson for the kiddies!  If you want to express yourself, blow something up!) By the climax, he gets cocky and brags about his special status, which is just as annoying.

* The plot was ill-conceived.
By stripping out the mythology that was so important to the novel, the film also strips out anything that gave depth to the plot.  The result is a simple treasure hunt, but one that doesn't have many clues ala National Treasure to keep you guessing.  While going about his everyday business, Will just randomly sees a vision of a spiral pattern, then hunts around until he finds the Sign hidden in the vicinity.  There are also some gaping holes in the plot.  In one scene Will's little sister gets inadvertently introduced to his magical world, but never seems to question the experience or bring it up to other family members.  Did Will use magic to make her forget?  If he did, it wasn't shown in the movie.

*  The climax was boring and ridiculous.
The final ""battle"" was a downright boring affair with lots of heavily stylized camera work and little action.  The Big Bad Rider seemed strangely easily intimidated by a 14-year old boy and his bragging.  I won't detail the final plot-twists for people who want to see the movie, but suffice to say that they left more unanswered questions that stretch suspended disbelief to the breaking point.

In sum, this movie played as a cheap, hole-ridden Harry Potter knock-off.  This might be good movie to rent for kids roughly in the ""tween"" age range or a little younger, provided they like fantasy and haven't read the books.  Some of the scenes may be a little scary for very young children.  The over-simplified and unconvincing plot will likely put off older teens and adults.  The Harry Potter franchise and some other recent films have upped the ante in making family fantasy films that are truly for the whole family - complex and interesting enough to entertain adults as well as children.  I would argue that it has also raised expectations that book adaptations be reasonably faithful to the source material.  The Seeker fails on both accounts.",1219536000,,3038,4.843023255813954
3243945,4,B000XUUQRE,"Whether or not you agree with the film's adaptation of the book series, The Seeker is a well-made piece of film art.  I was impressed with the cinematography and the use of angles and lenses to heighten the feelings of the protagonist as he discovers his destiny and struggles with it.  Lighting was also masterful in this film, as it should be in a film about the struggle between light and dark.  The only qualm I had was with Christopher Eccleston: he gave a rather stilted performance as The Rider.  If you are a great fan of the books, try to disengage your criticism and simply enjoy the film for its own art form.",1217980800,,620,4.412280701754386
3243946,3,B000XUUQRE,"Individual performances by the actors are pretty good here, though somehow the lead comes across as a little overdone and not believable at the end when the young Will Stanton realizes the origin of the sixth sign and takes a dramatic verbal stand against the Dark.

What is nice about this movie is the way it starts out with normal kids in a normal world and then introduces little elements of fantasy bit by bit into that normal world.  The local character parts are nicely acted, though Ian McShane's character does not get much of a chance to really develop and is limited in range, which is really too bad given the power of McShane.

Where I suspect people will find this one loses them is in the final third of the movie, when suddenly some of the characters go through changes that are not well explained and the magical world intrudes on the regular world with a ferocity that demands more of an explanation at the end of the movie than is given.  In other words, at the very end many people are likely to say, ""Hey, wait a minute, how do we understand or how come no one is talking about X and Y?""

I wish they had done more with the Old People and toned down the ending.

Still, while it is not as slick as Harry Potter, the first third of the movie did a better job than HP of making us believe magic could exist hidden alongside everyday reality.  It also does not have the corney stereotypes and kid humor of HP, something a viewer may or may not appreciate.

I wanted to like it more, but in fairness, it is a 3 star movie at best.  Somehow the elements did not all come together on this one.",1217980800,,1608,4.2805280528052805

Additionally, while the style used to establish the mood around the 'rider' was effective in the beginning, it did not vary much over the course of the movie, and thus began to feel stale by the end.  The director also could not seem to resist the urge to slow down action shots in 'Matrix' style.

As for the acting, Alexander Ludwig does a good job as Will Stanton.  Christopher Eccleston is a very talented actor, and seems to be holding back in this movie, somehow, or not quite on his game, which is rather disappointing (maybe he dislikes Romania).

Now, the biggie: the story.  All in all, I have to rate this by far as one of the weakest book adaptations that I have seen (ok, the Scifi Channel adaptation of 'A Wizard of Earthsea' was FAR worse).  That does not mean it is a terrible movie though.  The book is of a high enough quality that even this watered down, very loose adaptation of it still has some merit.

What is difficult for me to understand though is that the novel was saturated with the myths and traditions of the british isles, and that whole feeling is entirely removed from the movie.  Some have suggested that this was because the director felt these were in opposition to his Christian beliefs (which seems odd as King Arthur is universally portrayed as a Christian).  The signs were originally all in the shape of celtic crosses, for instance, and the last great battle which the movie places as '1000 years ago' was, in the book, the battle of baden hill with King Arthur (and Merriman Lyon actually being Merlin), etc. This is all removed, and the movie could just as easily have taken place in Romania, where they filmed it.

The biggest problem that I had though is that instead of him being part of something bigger than himself in the battle against the dark, this telling of it has the other 'Old Ones' have to resort to cross bows and swords, because they seem to have virtually no power of their own.  Not only does this lack literary sense, it also has the effect of making much of the movie feel like a superhero-worship film, instead of an epic, large scale battle which is much more.  Will becomes this embodiment of light, placed opposite the 'rider', who was the embodiment of the dark.  This one-on-one situation might appeal to modern movie audiences, but just serves to be reductionist and effectively VASTLY limits both what the light and the dark are.

The sub-plot about his father being a physicist who had studied the actual nature of light and dark struck me as a total non-sequitur, which did little to nothing to enhance the story and just sucked up time which should have been used in more meaningful character development.

Another sore thumb is that members of his family get carried on his time journeys with him, and he doesn't just wipe their memory (a power old ones have in the book) afterwards.  Aside from being weirded out at the moment, the subject never comes up again as it would in reality.

The ending was particuarly painful. What was, in the past, an epic battle between light and dark which the light barely won, was a quick and trite utter dominion of the dark by will (without the aid of any of the other old ones, annoyingly enough). I was just like, the whole movie has been leading to this moment, AND THAT IS IT?

Overall, not a total failure, but definitely not the inspiring triumph that the book is.  It would be enjoyed a lot by people in the 8-14 range, in particular.  It is not really an adult film, although adults with a particular love of fantasy, who have not read the book, would be likely to enjoy it as well.",1214006400,,4077,4.514285714285714

They shouldn't have bothered! This film is an offensive travesty with no resemblance to the book at all with the exception that the signs need to be collected. The casting of some little snotbag of an actor as Will is unforgivable along with all the other additions, subtractions & general 'creative liscence' that was taken.

The movie they named The Seeker: the dark is rising has so little in common with the book it should have had a different title.  I hate how everyone says that Will is just this poor boy that suddenly realizes he has powers. Did anyone read the book? He is an old one, once he becomes an old one he is no longer a little boy in possession of these powers he doesn't know how to control, he is an immortal being, whose very existence was created to stop the dark and allow mankind to live their own life. He isn't a confused little boy trying to find signs he doesn't really understand the meaning of. He doesn't have fits of rage, and teenage hormonal angst where he sets fire to things. And merrimen was a joke! This man is supposed to be the oldest of the old ones, and his mentor. Not some dumb butler who happens to know nothing about boys and need to be led by the hand by old Mrs. Greythorne (don't even get me started on her).
Overall I thought the plot was dumb (Tom is Will's lost twin brother who was locked in this weird sphere for most of his life what???), the special effects were dull, and the whole movie laughable.

3243970,1,B000XUUQRE,"If anyone is familiar with the history of The Seeker's production, you already know that it was very loosely adapted from the books by a fundamentalist director.  Besides the issue that Will suddenly was made older & ""modernised"", the adaptation completely missed the point of the book series.  The books were definately written for children rather for an all ages audience (the story is not necessarily about the ""hero's journey"" or ""coming of age"" issues, but rather about young children trying to understand unexplained forces & issues of the world through mysterious events, magic & adventure), but they did have some interesting comments on children grappling with different forces of the world.  This film simplifies and changes the main concepts and has among the most uninteresting dialogues I've heard, very poor character development & predictable plot.  (if I wanted to see a Christian-themed fantasy, I'd rather see the Narnia films, even with all their faults or watch LOTR or The Exorcist again).

It's one of the worst movie adaptations I have seen since the Earthsea Chronicles.  I rented it even though I read bad reviews, but wanted to give this film a chance since I love this subgenre so much.  I gave it one star for the presence of Christopher Eccleston.

A film does not have to be an exact adaptation, but should still carry forth the basic essence of the novel that is being adapted.

If you are in the mood to see some fun fantasy film based on good books, there is so much to choose from, such as the Harry Potter series, the European version/television series of Wrinkle in Time, Stardust, Spiderwick Chronicles (could have been better dialogue, but some of the characters are very charming), The Water Horse (surprisingly one of the best children's book adaptations of 2007) and Golden Compass (very Hollywood, but can be good depending on the next film).",1211500800,,1884,4.936708860759493

Rather than following the life and excitement of these wonderful books, the director/producer/whoever took the cheap and easy road, creating a middle of the road, predictable story ... or worse. The ""Old Ones"" are one dimensional caricatures of Harry Potter characters, the seductive witch virtually ignores the entire feminist movement, and the storyline has needless updates with webcams and ipods.

Too bad, really. The young man who played Will had a fair level of screen presence ... he is a young man with potential.

What captured me initially about Ms. Cooper's wonderful stories was, similar to J.K.

3244004,2,B000XUUQRE,"I have read and re-read Susan Cooper's ""The Dark is Rising"" many times since I first discovered it in the late 1970s. It is a wonderful book, one of my top ten all-time favorites, and so is the series. This movie is only very loosely based on the book, and is, in and of itself, a bad movie whether you have read the book or not.

If you have read the book, you will be horrified at how many needless changes were made to the plot and characters.

If you have not read the book, you will be confused because you won't know what is really going on.

I never expect a movie version fo a book to follow the book exactly, but it should at least keep the important aspects of a story. This movie does not. It tears away many of the very best things of the book, and alters what little is left so badly that it darkens the story where there should have been light (such as in the relationships among the Stanton children).

It doesn't help that, despite some excellent actors, everyone was miscast, and some of the most important characters (Will and Merriman especially) are made into such horrible characters that one might weep at the wreckage.

The worst thing is that, after seeing this movie, people who have never read the book might avoid it, thinking it is as chaotic, confusing, and unsatisfactory as the movie. The book, and the other books in the series, are well worth reading no matter what your age.

Plot summary: The basic story is that of Will, a boy who comes into his spiritual inheritance as being the last-born of the ""Old Ones,"" mysterious guardians who have been shepherding and aiding humanity in its fight against the Dark (the powers of evil) for millenia. When an Old One is born, he or she does not remember being an Old One. Old Ones must be reminded of their true natures by reading a magical book on or shortly after their 11th birthday (the age is changed to 14 in the movie). That is one of the tasks Will must accomplish in this story.

Another task is for Will to retrieve six signs of power that can be used to help fight against the Dark. He needs to move through time to accomplish his tasks. In the book, the six signs are actual physical objects; in the movie, one of the horrible changes made is that the sixth sign is Will himself (I am not spoiling anything here--you know that this is so as soon as they say, ""the sixth sign isn't hidden"").

Of course, the agents of the Dark do all within their power to stop Will from remembering who he truly is and from recovering all six signs.

That's the gist of both the book and the movie. This summary does not convey how evocative and magical Ms. Coooper's book is, and how very much the opposite the movie is. Will especially is made into such an unlikable character--pouty, bratty, sullen, and, when he gets his powers, ready to flaunt them and throw his weight around with them instead of handling them wisely as even a young Old One would do--that I wonder how anyone can like him or care much for what happens to him.

If you have not watched this movie, don't.

Update 04-05-08:  I saw the preview of the DVD for this movie while wandering around Target, and it really reminded me what a terrible, predictable movie this is.  Don't be fooled by the preview.  It's the most cohesive bit about this mess.",1204416000,,479,4.686746987951807
3244027,1,B000XUUQRE,"I have waited nearly all my life for someone to make Susan Cooper's ""The Dark is Rising"" books into a film(s). Now that there is one, I wish it was never made. Why can't producers and screenwriters just STICK TO THE BOOK??? The books are SO much more interesting than this movie. Even just by watching the trailer, you can tell that they practically changed at least 50% of the story. And the Rider's horse is supposed to be BLACK!",1203638400,,431,4.4
3244028,1,B000XUUQRE,"The book this movie is based on is an absolutely wonderful work of children's literature, probably one of the top 10 works of fantasy for children of all time. Couldn't the folks who made this movie have at least chosen some other (not good) book to base this movie on? This movie is a work of bad, not-fan fiction, by people, it appears, who did not bother to read the book first.",1203120000,,381,4.305555555555555
3244029,3,B000XUUQRE,"THE SEEKER revolves around an American boy named Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig).  Will and his family are transplants currently living in England.  On his birthday Will discovers that he is the last of a group of immortal warriors of Light, the ""Old Ones"".  The Old Ones have supernatural abilities, including the power to travel through time and space, and are engaged in a long-time struggle against the forces of Dark.  Will is a special Old One, not only because he is the last Old One, but because he is also the Seeker--the person chosen to seek and find six Signs of Power (in the shape of a circle with a cross).  When united the signs form a great weapon to fight the Dark.  Will, however, only has a few days to find and united the Signs before the Dark Rider (Christopher Eccleston) and his minions reach the height of their power and will be able to overcome and withstand even the power of the united Signs.

THE SEEKER is based upon Susan Cooper's beloved novel, THE DARK IS RISING.  However, other than a few names, locations, and sparse plot outline, THE SEEKER has no semblance to THE DARK IS RISING.  For example, Will is turned from a British boy into an American, the character of the Walker is erased, and there is no hunt.  I'm a huge fan of Susan Cooper's stories and when I learned about THE SEEKER, I was quite excited about it, but I was extremely disappointed by the movie adaptation.  That's not to say the movie is terrible, because it's not.  It is a decent escapist fantasy flick that, as a movie, isn't too bad.  It is, however, a very, very,  poor adaptation of the story it is based upon.  All of the Celtic mythology, sense of magic, and powerful spiritualism that are such an integral part of Cooper's novel have been eliminated.  The result is a decent fantasy movie that's entertaining to watch, but that fails to spark the imagination or encourage the heart and doesn't have much spirit.",1201478400,,1927,4.558139534883721

8229949,4,B000XUUQRE,"Christopher Eccleston is back as The Doctor -- no not THAT one -- this Doctor is a disguise for The Rider, an agent of darkness seeking to snuff out all light on planet Earth.

Enter The Seeker, the seventh son of a seventh son, a boy of 14 bullied by his older brothers who is convinced there's nothing noteworthy about himself.

The Seeker is a coming of age fantasy perfect for young audiences and certain to be a hit with your tween or teenager.  Eccleston's Rider/Doctor delights the Whovians in your family with powerful performances that thrill and excite as only a former Doctor Who can.

Definitely worth buying!",1500595200,,621,4.669724770642202
