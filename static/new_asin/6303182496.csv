7840431,4,6303182496,"MS. Beamen is so pretty and sexy, without being cheap.  She should have been cast in bigger films.  She can act, if you have every seen Starved, you have seen proof of that.  The clip where she gets the evil boss in bed, and on Video, is one of the sexiest ever filmed!  I know she works as a trainer in CA, but I hope to see her back in future films!",1145404800,5,351,3.8333333333333335
7840432,1,6303182496,"This item, marketed as being a ""psychological thriller"", is devoid of thrills and requires scant astuteness to understand that psychology has no noteworthy function within its story that, although avowedly targeting the evils of sexual harassment, is in fact simply another fully clichd tale of wayward lust, utilized here as excuse for young women to remove their clothing as they go about conducting plot-impelled affairs. Tahnee Welch plays Ashley, a young graphic artist of depicted loose morals who, in rather incongruous fashion, decides to withhold from her new supervisor Michael Miller (John Laughlin) those favours that she has proffered freely to others sharing her workplace, yet goes even farther by filing a lawsuit against Miller for his alleged sexual harassment of her. Shortly after losing her case due to lack of evidence, Ashley departs from the storyline, fortunately for viewers as Welch is a poor actress with a stunted emotional range and a proclivity for blurting her lines. During the movie's second half, Ashley's sister Kay (Lee Anne Beaman) replaces her as the primary female character in the scenario as well as in the prurient eye of Miller, with Kay nurturing a bold tactic of restoring her sister's stained reputation through a sirenic plan that she believes Michael will not be able to withstand. Beaman is the sole player in the film who manages to build a little something of value from a role, albeit her lines are equally as Johnny One Note dreadful as is all of the dialogue, most of which seemingly is written to force its simplistic meaning into skulls of viewers who may otherwise overlook a continuing stream of single entendres. Generic formulae are maintained throughout the course of this poorly scripted and directed affair that even conforms to that rule of scoring that requires a solo wailing saxophone during obligatory and hackneyed lovemaking activity, the purpose of which is presumably to harass sexually any of those watching who may be suffering from an extended period of puberty.",1106870400,4,2038,5.141566265060241
7840433,5,6303182496,"I love this film for one long legged blonde reason called Kathy Shower, who unfortunately, is almost wasted in this film. However if your'e going to watch this film there is no better reason than to watch it for Kathy. It was almost a vehicle for Kathy but it's as if it drove off without her  leaving Kathy standing around 'reacting' instead of acting. There is one  hot scene with hubby badboy whom the film title is named after (improper  conduct-er) but it's not long enough a scene and the chemistry that is  clearly visable between the two actors is not utilised to it's full  capacity. Damn and blast! The rest of the film is actually quite good (even  for a streight to video/cable tv job thingy) and concerns an advertising  executives roaming eye which eventually gets him into big trouble when his  former mistress commits suicide and her vengeful sister (blaming him for  the act) worms her way seductively into his life in order to destroy it  from within. Yeah! ...!  As you have probably gathered however, I am a  Kathy Shower fan first and foremost and enjoyed this film more for Kathy's  appearance so much so that I have two copies of the film. If you like this  film, you'll love 'Erotic Bounderies', (this is not an ad) also starring  Kathy Shower. I saw this film about a year ago and have since tried to  purchase it but to no avail.",943401600,30,1355,4.51440329218107
