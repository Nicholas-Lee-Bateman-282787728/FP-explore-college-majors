8476057,5,B004QWPMHY,"My kids -- ages 5 and 7 -- love this entire ""My Visit To The ..."" series (including ""My Visit To the Zoo"" and ""My Visit to the Circus""), and this one is their favorite. As a native Arizonan, I love that they're learning about rodeos and cowboy culture, and they love the action photography and story that keeps their attention, especially with lots of footage of and interviews with ""rodeo kids."" I'd been looking for such a great kid rodeo video for a long, long time.",1304985600,,469,4.402298850574713
8476058,5,B004QWPMHY,"This is a great introduction to the sport of rodeo.  It shows snippets of all the events and gives a good explanation of each event.  It is done really well and is an excellent teaching tool, especially for city kids that don't know anything about rodeo.  It was very entertaining as well.  This series of videos is really good.",1304294400,,328,4.508474576271187
8476059,5,B004QWPMHY,This is a wonderful DVD.  It's great to see a great American tradition like cowboys and rodeos being featured in a kid's program.  I was brought up in the West and have spent many wonderful hours attending rodeos and county fairs and this show really includes the best of what kids and adults love about rodeos.  Kid's especially like watching the mutton bustin' scenes- the little kids riding sheep are very cute.  Cowboy Bob is hilarious- he adds great energy to the program.  I also own the other videos from the My Visit Video series sold on Amazon (the Zoo and Circus) and they are equally as good!  I highly recommend them all.,1302048000,,633,4.557522123893805
