8132260,5,B000GHDPU4,Great Video. This DVD helps children learn ASL in a unique way. I have nine children ages 8-17 and they all love the video. I bought the DVD's to help an nonspeaking autistic child to communicate. I did not expect that my older children would love it.,1155254400,,251,4.361702127659575
