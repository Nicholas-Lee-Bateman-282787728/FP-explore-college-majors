8497138,5,B006FPS9W0,"This video was recommended to us by a friend who has visited Costa
Rica and we are very glad that we purchased it. We are thinking of moving to Costa Rica to retire. This video was perfect because it showcased beautifully the jungles, volcanoes, rain forests, national parks,  beaches, and also the cities of Grecia, Escazu, San Jose, and Alajuela where most of retired North Americans live. One of the best parts was the three interviews of North Americans already living there and what they think of the country.  Beautifully filmed and narrated it is just plain entertaining to watch.  We highly recommend it.",1398556800,,612,4.865384615384615

I thought the dvd would give a better overview of the different sites and locations in CR.  Oh well, I should have none better..",1387584000,,267,4.076923076923077

It is an intriguing and informative video with beautiful scenes of lush foliage, rivers, wildlife and local culture.  It definitely reveals how Costa Rica is a perfect place for those who love outdoor experiences. (PR)

8497143,5,B006FPS9W0,"My wife and I are planning a vacation to Costa Rica and came across this video on Amazon and I am so glad we did.  It's a beautifully filmed adventure through Costa Rica.  After watching the video, he have decided to visit the Arenal Volcano area and also manuel Antonio Beaches.  Plus we learned about Costa Rica culture and listened to some Canadians talk about their retirement life in Costa Rica.  Ken uses his camera to show the different regions and ecosystems of Costa Rica and his filming of the rain forest with it's birds and monkeys is spectacular.  We highly recommend this film.

8497144,4,B006FPS9W0,"I thought this video presented a nice view of Costa Rica culture and scenery. Very distracting narrator though, Southern Drawl was so thick sometimes that I had difficulty understanding what he was saying. Maybe I will watch it next time without sound.",1364860800,,252,5.023809523809524
