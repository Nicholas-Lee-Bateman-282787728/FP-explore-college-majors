8629178,5,B001LOTXZM,If you love Martin freeman you will love this and even if your not this is still a fun show to watch,1434499200,,100,3.590909090909091
8629179,2,B001LOTXZM,"I am disturbed by the rave reviews for this show. I love Simon Nye. I love Martin Freeman. How could this miss? This just isn't funny. ""The Robinsons"" which only lasted one season was much better. Just don't know what went wrong or why I feel this way. I didn't laugh once and a lot of the humor was cruel. The cast was fine....the writing was just bad. Sorry.

8629180,5,B001LOTXZM,"I love this quirky British sitcom, just the right touch of dry humor. You will need a international DVD player.. Computers usually can handle it.",1415059200,,145,4.84
8629181,5,B001LOTXZM,"Early and priceless Martin Freeman, this simple comedy keeps you laughing at the foibles of Everyman. You also get a very young Ryan Cartwright as ""the student"".",1378252800,,161,5.0
8629182,5,B001LOTXZM,"I too have to agree with the first reviewer, when they mentioned, that the writers & producers didn't do enough episodes. As this a an A+++ show! It is both funny & entertaining. All the actors & actresses did a bang up job.",1374710400,,224,4.232558139534884
8629183,5,B001LOTXZM,My only objection to this series is that there weren't more episodes. The characters are quirky and create the most ridiculous situations.,1374192000,,138,5.318181818181818
