5666115,5,B00BQI3Y7Q,"We have 6 - 8 deer that eat in our backyard everyday and have grown to love seeing them. But we wanted to know much more about them. ""Private Life of Deer"" really educated us on so many aspects of deer life in America. This is great for kids and adults.",1387497600,7,253,3.980392156862745
5666116,5,B00BQI3Y7Q,"Saw this on PBS and enjoyed it.

While I don't think I learned much new information
about the habits of the whitetail- I watch them every day at my place- the documentary was
well enough done that I believe even the Biology professor I deer hunt with will enjoy it.",1387065600,,265,4.3
5666117,5,B00BQI3Y7Q,It was heartwarming to once again see sweet Blossom grow from a rescue fawn into an Ambassador (of sorts) in the community.  She gave as much love as she received.,1383350400,,163,4.433333333333334
5666122,3,B00BQI3Y7Q,Seller was great.  Film is very basic info about urban white-tail deer.,1461110400,,71,4.916666666666667
5666123,1,B00BQI3Y7Q,Found the actions of the people in the film horribly invasive. Once the film got to the group search for fawns I had to turn it off. What in people's minds do they think interfering at this level in wildlife life is okay. Attaching photos of three people man handling a new born fawn. Found the behavior in this film repulsive and too invasive. No animal should witness their newborn they are trying to protect being man handled by a group of other animals. And a group of eight adult humans should never approach a baby fawn - unbelievable the carelessness and lack of consideration for the fawn and mother.,1460419200,11,608,4.536363636363636

5666140,3,B00BQI3Y7Q,Interesting if your not familiar with deer.  If you are an outdoors man or woman you will find the documentary quite basic in relation to deer behavior.,1447372800,,152,4.62962962962963

5666143,2,B00BQI3Y7Q,"This documentary left many basic questions I had about deer as a species unanswered. I was disappointed by the focus on a specific set of deer in a suburban neighborhood - the impressions of the human surburbanites were not scientific, and frankly I wasn't interested. Yes, deer are beautiful and cute, but I don't need or want a documentary to tell me that over and over. I wanted to know why deer form and lose antlers, what is the ""velvet"", why fawns have spots when young, how mothers prepare their young for yearlinghood, how families and herds interact, how deer around the world vary in habitat and coloration, and why. I wanted to learn more about non-kill efforts to curb populations. Perhaps I missed something.",1446163200,,721,4.776

5666157,5,B00BQI3Y7Q,You have to watch this if you live where the deer used to live.,1443139200,,63,3.5714285714285716
5666158,3,B00BQI3Y7Q,Interesting. A little boring,1443139200,,28,6.25

5666160,5,B00BQI3Y7Q,Its ironic watched documentaries on a host of animals that are exotic and rate..but never learned about an animal that was browsing my bushes right outside!,1442275200,2,156,5.038461538461538
5666161,3,B00BQI3Y7Q,"Fairly informative.  However, I live in South Texas and encounter large populations of white-tailed deer on a daily basis.  This would be a good film for those who have no knowledge of the genus and are interested in knowing just the basics.",1438819200,,241,4.714285714285714
5666162,3,B00BQI3Y7Q,It was okay documentary. Hubby and I fell asleep.,1434585600,,49,4.555555555555555

5666182,2,B00BQI3Y7Q,"This show was a bit too slow for me especially after watching the mules deer document ""Touching the wild, living with the Mule Deer of Dead Gulch which I loved.  I had to fast forward most of this show so I cannot recommend personally.",1430697600,,235,4.340909090909091
5666183,4,B00BQI3Y7Q,"Different, but I enjoyed watching it.",1430352000,,37,5.333333333333333

5666186,4,B00BQI3Y7Q,"I watched this with my 4 year old because we have a lot of deer in our neighborhood and she's always asking me about them.

I thought this was a great documentary to teach a 4 year old about what a deer is and why they come around people when other animals stay far away. My daughter was fascinated by it and now she's always looking for deer whenever we go outside. I did have to explain it to her in simpler terms at times because it's not geared to a 4 year old viewer, but it's got furry creatures on the screen nearly every second so she was captivated.

As an adult I thought it was watchable, but it's not the most interesting documentary ever. It does get into herd structure and that's interesting. But overall it probably could have been whittled down to 30 minutes.

If you see deer everywhere and want to know a little more about them, it's worth watching once.",1428883200,,873,4.278787878787878

5666191,4,B00BQI3Y7Q,"So I watched this show thinking I knew about deer as a 30 plus year hunter.  Solid info, but only  demonstrates the true problem, man.  We deleveloped this easy evironment for the deer to live and now there is not a natural predator.  I know many of the people in this would oppose hunting.  If they would shown all sides of the issue I would gave 5 stars.",1428278400,,356,4.176470588235294

5666219,5,B00BQI3Y7Q,"While I thought I knew a lot about white tail deer, I found there was much more to learn about these amazing, shy creatures.  There was a lot of scientific data shared alongside interesting anecdotal musings to keep it from being too dry. Two things struck me from this video:  1) The white tail physiological make up [eyes/sight, the diversity of plants they eat, why they rest during the day, etc.] and 2) the comment made at the end where one contributor stated that many people go to Africa to view the great herds, but we have great herds in our own back yard and sometimes forget to enjoy them.

5666264,4,B00BQI3Y7Q,"This will give many of us interesting information we may not have had before in an engaging manner, and at times it is completely fascinating. Goes down easy. In the last third, it seems to lose focus by veering off into oddities. The time used for the odditiesalthough they were certainly interestingcould have been better used by going into a little more depth on the main subject. For instance, it shows how the surprising fact that female deer also fight was discovered, but says nothing about why they do. For me, some choices made as to what to include tilted it more toward infotainment than it needed to be. Still, the production is largely successful, and perhaps the demands of a wider audience need to be acknowledged. Its nothing but good news that there is funding for projects like this. Its well edited, makes good use of short interviews, and contains some wonderful shots and sequences. I learned something and it made me happy.",1413676800,,945,4.7682926829268295

This movie was done in a very interesting way, with lots of different footage from different areas.

The quality of the filming was not always perfect, but they did use some home-owner video to show some of the deer antics.

5666285,4,B00BQI3Y7Q,"This documentary gives you a chance to learn a bit about the shy, gentle, critters that lurk around the neighborhood, stare into your car's headlights and eat your garden when your not looking.  The film provides just enough information and does not get bogged down in minute details and statistics which I'm sure most people prefer. A plus is there is nothing in the documentary that might give you concern or embarrassment when watching it with even the youngest of kids. The photography is very good and the narration is easy to listen too. Definitely worth a look, if like me, you know next to nothing about the elusive animals that live among us.",1409961600,7,651,4.7105263157894735

A research team in Pennsylvania has chosen a small suburb in Pennsylvania to do research on the local deer. It's amazing what they find. Also, they ask the inhabitants of the area to take photos and record their interactions for a one-year period. Watching this video will help humans see how we are the invaders of the deer habitat, not the other way around.",1397692800,2,521,4.494736842105263
5666302,3,B00BQI3Y7Q,not worth buying but was worth watching once. I bought it just to see deer grazing through the metro areas as it is always interesting to spot them. Got kind of bored though,1395187200,,173,4.2727272727272725

8572534,3,B00BQI3Y7Q,"We have deer and one day a coyote got one of the babies when it was very very young. A bunch of does were racing around the woods as the baby cried out - but they didn't run away. (the coyote ran when we approached, not realizing what was happening). But I wanted to understand this. Several does approached the hurt baby as well. (the baby died) This movie didn't really go into the dynamics of dear families, how they live. It was mostly about how they go about living in the suburbs, very little private about it. There was one instance where they went looking for a specific behavior and found some deer but didn't get the behavior and said, oh well, if they had behaved such and such it would look like this ... I was left wondering, well, did you try a second night? A third? So it was just OK.",1473120000,2,800,4.201298701298701
