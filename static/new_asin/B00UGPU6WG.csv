8705818,3,B00UGPU6WG,"Dr. Chapman conducts sex research anonymously with a variety of women. The movie begins with flashbacks and interviews with women who have a variety of sexual difficulties. It then follows the current sex lives of the women. Although there are some bright spots among the actors (Claire  Bloom and Glynis Johns in particular), top stars generally turn in subpar performances. This movie actually gets better as it progresses. Although the movie has passed its Use By date, it could be a worthwhile viewing experience.",1466640000,,517,5.154761904761905
