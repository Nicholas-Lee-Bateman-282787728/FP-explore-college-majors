7889656,5,6305458146,"There are essentially only 4 publised video recordings of Cannonball's band available and this is one of them.  The beauty of this one is that it is the earliest available recording,from 1961, and the only of the Cannonball Adderley Quintet (the other 3 are all sextet).  The recording is monoral and of early TV quality but an absolute gem to watch and hear. This is a must-have for any Cannonball fan.  The audio has also been released as a CD on Koch Jazz KOC CD-8567.  The DVD version of this recording, Idem Home Video IDVD-1010 available in PAL format only, also has the Modern Jazz Quartet.",1094688000,2,597,4.60377358490566
