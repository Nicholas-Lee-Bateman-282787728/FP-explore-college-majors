3882784,5,B0029ZUQ8A,"After reading reviews of the DVD release of other teams I got a feeling that this might happen to this DVD set I'm hoping that I'm wrong just have to wait and see as for the top 49er games DVD set this is what I think should be included.
1.49ERS - Dallas 1981 regular season game 49ers walked all over the Dallas in this game final score 49ers 45 - Dallas 14
2.49ERS - Dallas NFC TITLE ""the catch""
3.49ERS - Rams 1989 Monday night comeback great game
4.49ERS - Jets 36-30 1998 (G. Hearst TD Run)
5.49ERS - Giants 2002 Wild Card Game
6.49ERS - NY Giants 1981 Division Playoffs Montana first playoff game
7.49ERS - Philadelphia 1989 49ers score 21pts in the fourth Quarter.
8.49ERS - Cleveland 1987 Rice burns browns defensive backfield for three touchdowns
9.49ERS - Dallas 38-28 1994 Championship Young takes 49ers to Super Bowl
10.49ERS - Dallas 1994 Regular season game of the year
11.49ERS - Denver 1997 49ers beat super bowl Champions.
12.49ERS - Packers 30-27 1998 (Wild Card Game)
13.49ERS - New Orleans 1992 Young leads comeback in the Fourth Quarter
14.49ERS - Minnesota 24-21 Young's Famous 49-yard run.
15.49ERS - Cincinnati 1996 Young comes in to lead comeback.",1244332800,2,1172,4.666666666666667
3882785,4,B0029ZUQ8A,"I'm hoping that there are sets in the works for teams with lots of Super Bowl wins that include other games. A valid Niners set would have to include:

- the 1981 NFC Championship game vs the Cowboys ""the catch""

- the dramatic 1983 playoff game vs the Lions

- the 1988 playoff drubbing of the Vikings

- the 1988 NFC Championship game win in Chicago

- the 1990 divisional round win against the Redskins

- the 1994 NFC Championship game win over the Cowboys

- the 2001 Wild Card shoot-out win over the Giants (a great game even with the controversial endng)

Look there- I'm not a 49ers fan, and I named 7 games that I'd imagine a Niners fan would love to have just off the top of my head. I'm sure more research would reveal lots more. Montana had innumerable dramatic regular season performances, and there was a great Steve Young comeback in Philly one year, if I'm remembering correctly.

Other teams like the Raiders and Redskins who have multiple Super Bowl wins have been rewarded with sets of just the three Super Bowl wins, while the Bears got a FULL SEASON and the Eagles, who have NO Super Bowl wins just got a loving 10 DISC set!!! I'm happy for the fans of those teams, but GADS! It's almost like the Raiders and 'Skins fans are being punished for rooting for a successful team. And now it looks like the 49ers have joined the ranks with this 5 disc set. All three of these teams desreve the full 10 disc treatment, like the Packers, Cowboys, and Giants got (and PLEASE improve on the lame Vikings set).",1244246400,11,1520,4.4

3882787,3,B0029ZUQ8A,Could have been much better.  The picture quality is not that good and there is little additional coverage of the games.  The NFC Playoff game against Dallas leading up to Super Bowl 16 should have been included since it was one of the most dramatic games ever won by the 49ers.

games on some very old VHS tapes. He was very impressed with the clarity
and color on most of the games but I noticed that the 49er's vs Dolphins
game was not so clear but very good none the less.

If you are a 49er fan and want to watch all of their Super Bowl wins again

3882810,5,B0029ZUQ8A,Thank goodness the 49ers are a great team again. It's been too many years between relevance in the mid-90's until the past couple of years. I've watched these games over and over again.,1354060800,,185,4.636363636363637
3882811,5,B0029ZUQ8A,"Great DVD set of all 5 of the 49ers SB victories.  These are the original network broadcasts of these games.  Just a reminder to all the people who think the quality is poor.  The quality is what it is, we didn't have HD broadcasts back then.  The disc of SBXIX is grainy and the audio isn't that great but to have this game on disc is fine with me.  GO NINERS!!!",1339459200,4,363,4.056338028169014
3882812,3,B0029ZUQ8A,"This is a great DVD set, with the exception of the first half audio for Super Bowl XIX all of them are very good quality. However this is the team of the 80's and all you have is the Super Bowls. Yes the first three were great, XXIV & XXIX not so much (no competition), but what about some of the other great games this team has had. I know other people have put their input in on other games so I won't do the same, but please either make a second volume or rerelease it with some more games",1337299200,2,492,3.93

3882814,4,B0029ZUQ8A,"As most people stated, more games should have been included in this pack. It's essentially the original broadcasting for all 5 49er Superbowls. While it is the original broadcasting, I did notice there were some plays (very few however) that were cut out. This didn't ruin the experience in any way, but something I wanted to point out. Not too sure why that is the case. Also the quality on the Niners Superbowl against the Dolphins isn't that great, it's a lil foggy at times and you have to turn the sound up. Again, not a deal breaker as you can still visibly see all the players and the game itself. Overall, if you are a 49er fan this is still a must by. The great Montana and Young doing what they do best in the biggest of games.",1328659200,,737,4.309352517985611

3882817,5,B0029ZUQ8A,"I ordered this boxset today despite some of the negative reviews. Ive been a fan of the 49ers since the NFL came to British tv screens for the first time in late 1982. To me it was a no brainer that I had to get these dvds. For years I have found it baffling that NFL films had such a lock on what was released to the general public as opposed to dvd or vhs releases of games from the network channels like CBS, NBC etc. In England,  important football (or soccer!) games that take place are later released for the public to buy. Its par for the course and has been since the advent of video. Only recently has that begun to happen in the States. As an example, when I bought the Team of the Decade 88 yearbook for the 49ers long long ago, I think the tape ran for about 50 minutes. No lengthy footage was given to any of the games including the bloody superbowl! For years I believe that fans in the US have been shortchanged by NFL films. In my opinion NFL films should compliment the network broadcasts rather than being the only archive footage sold.

As for the dvds I take on board and accept totally what people are saying. A five disc set is ludicrous for the 49ers. For me, the greatest performance may just be the NFC championship destruction of the Bears in their own backyard. But there are LOADS of other matches that deserve a place in this set and supposedly it is volume one. At the end of the day it is the whole games, it is the original network broadcasts, it is the superbowls and it is the 49ers from their greatest (up to this point) period. We have been short changed for so long that for me this is an essential buy. Now bring on volume two!",1284076800,3,1665,4.2
3882818,3,B0029ZUQ8A,"I loved seeing these Super Bowls, but there were so many games that should be here.  If Dallas and the Giants have games beyond the Super Bowl why not the Niners?  The Catch Game against Dallas, Catch 2 against the Packers, 2002 Wild Card game against the Giants, 1994 NFC Championship Game, Young's last second run against the Vikings, Montana destroys the Eagles in 1989.  1988 & 1989 championship games.  All those should have been there too.  Hopefully they will come out with a second volume",1282262400,2,496,4.72093023255814
3882819,1,B0029ZUQ8A,"I have all these Super Bowls on VHS and when I saw them on DVD, I thought great! But to my disappointment, the film quality is so bad they make the copies I have on VHS look great! I wouldn't of paid 1 dollar for this load of crap, had I know the quality would be so bad. NFL films should be ashamed for putting out something so poor!!!",1281744000,4,336,3.8840579710144927

3882821,3,B0029ZUQ8A,"Why do teams like the Giants, Eagles and Cowboys have bigger sets. Where is the 1981 NFC Championship? 1994 NFC Championship? 1998 wildcard win vs Green Bay?

I mean it's not a bad set, but I think teams like the Steelers, Raiders, 49ers and Redskins got snubbed just because they won alot of SB's. They have way better histories than the Eagles. And they had alot of other great games outside of the Super Bowls.",1275436800,7,413,4.506666666666667
3882822,2,B0029ZUQ8A,"I love the 49ers. And I have to say I applaud the NFL for FINALLY releasing team-specific DVDs. However, this collection is seriously flawed in several ways:

- Quality is poor. These are original TV broadcasts. There is NO NFL Films footage that would be much higher quality. Yes, some of these games are old, but there must be better recording of these games. So if you buy this set, keep your video and sound quality expectations low.

- 49ers Greatest Games? Are you kidding me. EVERYONE knows the real Superbowls were the NFC Championships in the 80s and 90s. Second best? Nope. Several of these Superbowls are sleepers plain and simple. The other team had no chance. The niners just systematically ran over them on both sides of the ball.

- I'm sorry but the NFL just does not get media technology. They are just now starting to release team-specific game DVDs? Uh, hello, there is this thing called blu-ray. You might get a few of your people out of the NFL cave and look at the light. Why won't the NFL release something of REAL value - truly great games in beautiful Blu-ray with additional NFL Films footage.

This set has none of that and is a true disappointment. The set gets an extra star simply because they finally released some games to the public.",1264723200,4,1266,4.563876651982379
3882823,3,B0029ZUQ8A,"Good to have the full super bowls together, but this set is shortchanged by not having other key playoff games included, like some of the other team sets. If they ever do a version 2, my choices for additional games would be:

1) 1981 NFC Championship game vs Dallas (actually played Jan 82)
2) 1994 NFC Championship game vs Dallas (Jan 95)
3) 1994 regular season win vs Dallas
4) 1988 NFC Championship game vs Chicago (Jan 89)

3882827,5,B0029ZUQ8A,"As a Bengals fan, I've been searching high and low for a quality copy of Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. Now it blows that I have to order San Francisco's five greatest games to get what I want, but hey, I can set the other three DVD's on fire.

By the way, the Bengals and 49ers could have their own five greatest games disc:

1. Super Bowl XXIII

2. Super Bowl XVI

3. 1987: San Francisco wins 27-26 on a last second touchdown pass after the Bengals can't run out the clock.

4. 1996: Bengals go up 21-0 and then Stupid Steve Young leads the Niners back for a 28-21 win.

5. 1990: 49ers beat Bengals 20-17 in Overtime, great game and both teams would make the playoffs that year.",1249430400,3,676,4.161538461538462
3882828,3,B0029ZUQ8A,"It's good for 49er fans to get a release in this series, but as many reviewers have already noted, limiting the set to the 5 Super Bowl wins is a shame.  With the exception of Super Bowl 23, none of the SF Super Bowls really were great games in terms of being close or exciting games, and even SB 23 was pretty dull until the 4th quarter.  There are a number of truly great SF games that could have been added to easily fill out a 10 game set (The Catch I and II games, the 1989 Montana comeback win in Philly, and the 2002 playoff comeback vs. the Giants, to name just a few), as NFL Films has done for some other teams.

Perhaps it is just my copy, but the the picture and audio quality of the SB 19 disc is poor.  The color is washed out and the sound is muted.  The copy of the game that has generally circulated among game traders is superior, and I would recommend that if you have that one already, you may want to retain it.  The quality of the other discs are much better, although the color on the SB 24 recording seems to be a little dark.

Also, if you have personal recordings of these games that include pre and/or post games shows that you want to keep, you should hang on to those recordings.  The discs do not include any pre or post game materials, not even the well known farewell interview with Bill Walsh after SB 23.  Each game has been edited to remove some huddles and insignificant plays so as stay under 2 hours (apparently to fit on a single dvd without further compressing the quality of the recordings).

All in all, as a 49er fan/collector, it's nice to get this set, but it is a lot less than it could have been - It doesn't seem like NFL Films put much effort into it.",1248825600,38,1700,4.139817629179332
3882829,2,B0029ZUQ8A,"I am not a fan of the Forty-Niners. I am a Dallas fan. Being an objective Dallas fan, I have to say
the Forty-Niners are our great historic rival for championships. Dallas won 4 in the '70s and '90s,
and S.F. won 1 in the '90s and then there was the 1981 Championship game: won by the 49ers- the greatest
game they ever won. How on earth can that game be missing in this DVD collection? Who thought of that? The great
Vin Scully called the game for CBS another reason that game is a treasure to own for 49er fans.
As much as I hate the 49ers, I like the fact we have a rival that brings it when it counts. That's what makes
competition fun....The game I will always remember? How 'bout them Cowboys!",1248652800,3,699,4.147058823529412
3882830,4,B0029ZUQ8A,"The 49ers from the the 80's to today have had a lot of classic games that deserve to be on this set. There SB wins are great but I think the NFL could of definately done better with the game selection and definately could of put more in than the 49ers 5 SB wins (3 of which were kind of boring because they were blow outs as soon as the game began). Some games off the top of my head that I can think of are...

1. 49ers vs Jets- Painful game for me since I'm a Jets fan, but to be honest this was a classic game especially with the OT run by the infamous Garrison Hearst.

2. 49ers vs. Saints- Before the 49ers became a dynasty they were a mediocre team at best, but this would be the unofficial turn around for them since the 49ers and rookie Joe Montana would come back from a 35-7 deficit to win the game in OT.

3. Packers vs 49ers- This game for a lot of fans could be better known as The Catch II or the game where Terrell Owens became T.O.

4. 49ers vs Cowboys- The Catch

5. 49ers vs Giants- One of the wildest Wild Card games of all time in which the 49ers would win because of a crazy snap.

Now I know there are a lot more games than those 5 that 49ers fans remember, but hopefully the NFL can make another set with those games and a lot more.",1248048000,4,1255,3.921259842519685

This is a great set, but I am also disappointed that this was not a ten game set (like the Giants, Eagles, and Cowboys) or a 12 game set (like the Bears). The 49ers were involved in so many great games (I won't list them because it has already been done in other reviews) and it makes no sense that some of the non-Superbowl games were not included.

The 49ers won their first Super Bowl in 1981 and sustained their greatness for many many years after. Even being the first team to win 19 games in a season. But the bears get the full season package and i think they didn't even make the playoffs the following season. Then it was Walsh who put a guard in the backfield first but all you here is the bears and fridge. What is it with you people. And the Eagles,winners of uh, oh yeah no Super Bowls but lets give them a 10 disc set. While i will enjoy this set I am disapointed in how the NFL markets their game. The 49ers deserve to be represented the same way they have always represented the NFL. With class.",1246320000,32,829,4.0920245398773005

8358749,5,B0029ZUQ8A,"The NFL: San Francisco 49ers - 5 Greatest Games: Super Bowl Victories DVD set is good for what it is as it has been created.  Getting the 5 49ers Super Bowl victories on DVD in a set is really great.  Video quality is okay if you take into account that video technology in the 80's was not that great compared to the digital age.  So, degrading video quality from old video is understandable.  I don't have any issue with that knowing that one can't go back in time to bring technology back to record those Super Bowls with our current advancements.  Having the Super Bowls that the 49ers won on DVD is wonderful in itself.

It is the 49ers 5 Greatest Games and the Super Bowl Games are the 5 greatest games in the sense of victory achieving the goal those years wining the Super Bowl.  There were other great games, and other games that one could say was one of their greatest games like ""The Catch"" game.  One could say that was the most important game in 49ers history.  But, it does say on the cover ""5 Greatest Games"" and ""Super Bowl Victories"" which means we only get 5 videos.

The Steelers DVD set has only 5 videos which are their Super Bowl Victories.  It says the same thing like the cover of the 49ers DVD set which is ""5 Greatest Games"" and ""Super Bowl Victories"".  But, the New York Giants DVD set has 10 videos and it says on that cover ""10 Greatest Games"".  They don;t have 10 Super Bowl victories.

So if you look at it that way, that sucks that the 49ers one and the Steelers each have half the amount of videos as the New York Giants one.  It would have been nice if they put at least a few other games on the 49ers and the Steelers one.

But for the 49ers DVD set, you still do get all 5 of the Super Bowl victories on DVD which is wonderful.  Disappointing there is not more games or other great games in 49ers history included in the set.  I am disappoint, but at the same time happy the Super Bowls are on a DVD set.  So, I recommend the 49ers DVD set for what it is as a set with the 5 Super Bowl victories by the 49ers.  And, I am at least excited about having that.  With the DVD set as it is constructed, it is awesome to know  have the 49ers Super Bowl victories I can watch that will no longer degrade and wear out like the old recordings on my VHS tapes.",1457481600,,2284,4.1431818181818185

8358753,1,B0029ZUQ8A,"This may very well be the worst video and audio quality of any DVD I've ever seen.  If I didn't know better, I would say the quality of this set falls short of VHS tapes (of these games) I've viewed in the past ... I'd rate this as a zero if that were a choice.",1425427200,,261,3.7454545454545456
8358754,4,B0029ZUQ8A,This set is great for what it is which the 5 Superbowl victories the 49ers had in the 80's and the one in 94. If you enjoy watching 80's football like I do then I recommend picking up this set. The only downside I found is the picture quality of Superbowl XIX between the 49ers and the Dolphins. It looks like it was recorded off of a $4 VCR and then recorded multiple times over the years and we have the copy we see before us. Wish we could get a remastered copy of that game but for the 4 other Superbowls it is worth the money.,1421712000,,531,3.97196261682243
