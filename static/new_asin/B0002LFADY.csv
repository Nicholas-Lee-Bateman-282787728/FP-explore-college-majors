8028826,5,B0002LFADY,this video remains true to the spirit of dr. seuss books. the original illustrations are animated and my 3 year old son just loves to repeat the rhymes. it teaches reading and spelling but is also highly entertaining.  it's a good read along video if you have the books. highly recommended!,961891200,2,290,4.686274509803922
