7866639,5,6304179472,"woodstock is the lead in this special and it starts out with the cute little bird building his nest and splashing around in the bird bath, until woodstock finds his nest missing and enlists the help of his buddy, snoopy, dressed as sherlock holmes to find woodstock's nest. my favorite part in this special is the sally brown v. woodstock ""court case"" over the ownership of the nest with lucy acting as the judge. i've watched this several times on youtube and on the peanuts 1970's vol. 1 dvd. Gotta love mr. schulz's imangination.",1345766400,,532,4.670212765957447
7866640,5,6304179472,"It's the case of the missing bird's nest and Sherlock Snoopy is dogging the trail of the culprit who stole Woodstock's new home.  Not a single member of the Peanuts gang is safe from suspicion.

An incriminating twig found at Lucy's house points the guilty paw in her direction, but the tell-tale foootprints left at the scene of the crime lead America's ""Snoopy-est"" bloodhound straight to the real thief.

Meanwhile, Sally complains about some science homework which requires her to turn in an exhibit from nature.  Could there possible be a connection?  Legal expert Lucy is called upon to settle the dispute while Charlie Brown tries helplessly to help.

You'll be tracking clues right along with all the other Peanuts fans at your house as you enjoy this fully-animated ""whodunit"" again and again.",1289001600,,802,4.992481203007519
7866641,5,6304179472,"My favorite part of this Peanuts classic is when Patty is visited by Snoopy and indulges in a game of cops n robbers in a black bandit-style mask! The plot goes:Woodstock's fancy new bird nest disappears sending his pal Snoopy on a journey to find it. Throughout the adventure he handcuffs Lucy and Sally has a number of hissy fits involving the mystery (I will not spoil her TRUE participation in Woodstock's birds nest heist). What I love most about this is the soundtrack:Vince Guaraldi,in one of the last soundtracks he ever did for Peanuts had found the funk. Being a funk fan myself I LOVE the electric piano and ARP synthesizer grooves and the nice electric guitar work. It's one of my very favorite Peanuts soundtracks and I'd LOVE to get my hands on a copy of it if it exists.",1199664000,,785,4.535211267605634
7866642,5,6304179472,"Woodstock's nest is missing one afternoon and so it's Snoopy (a la Sherlock Holmes) to the rescue!  He comes dressed in the traditional detective attire- hat, cape, and a big pipe which blows bubbles instead of smoke (and Woodstock gets caught in the middle of many of these bubbles)!  He travels throughout town interviewing many of the suspects.  He handcuffs Lucy, who breaks free!  He interviews the sooty mess Pig Pen (and gets lots of dust up his nose)!  Funniest of all is when Snoopy comes to interview Peppermint Patty, who thinks he's come over to play Cops and Robbers (she dons a classic burglar's mask)!  After they've found the nest, the culprit (whom I dare not give away)takes Woodstock to court, leaving Judge Lucy to settle the final verdict (and she charges just a little bit more than the usual fee)!  This Charlie Brown special features a rather funky sounding jazz score by Vince Guaraldi.",991008000,7,911,4.801282051282051
7866643,5,6304179472,"As a kid, this was one of my favorite Charlie Brown tapes. And I just watched it again the other night, and it's held up very well. In fact, in many ways, I enjoy it even more now. As with most Peanut adventures, the musical score is just as enjoyable as the story.",971568000,5,265,4.018867924528302
