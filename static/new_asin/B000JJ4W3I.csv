2672213,4,B000JJ4W3I,I really loved this movie-it's one of my favorites.  The characters were real and interacted well together and I thought the plot was suspenseful!  I would definitely recommend this movie!,1268352000,,188,5.233333333333333
2672214,3,B000JJ4W3I,"Magma: Volcanic Disaster: 5 out of 10: The always watchable Xander Berkley (24) and the impish Amy Jo Johnson (Pink Power Ranger) lead a surprisingly solid cast down made for television disaster movie hell.

With Made for TV disaster movies the questions are not how good are certain elements but how mind numbingly awful will these elements be. Stack the deck with the terrifying fact this is a made for Sci-fi Channel Disaster movie (Only PAX is worse) and anything above pure pain is a feat of cinematic luck. This is not pure pain.

As I said the leads were watchable and the screenplay liked to actually kill off characters on screen which is a nice touch. In addition Amy Jo Johnson's attempts to simultaneously bed Xander Berkley and save his marriage were more entertaining than anything else in the movie. (Usually in disaster movies these subplots put the ""T"" in tedium.) Alas the rest of the movie is a true disaster and both the screenwriter and the effects/sets departments share blame. First off all most natural disasters are not caused by man. Perhaps a look near a dictionary for the definition of natural might clear this up.

The idea that nuclear testing and chemical waste is polluting the core of the earth (it's solid by the way and starts about 400 miles below the surface) causing it to expand is not the most ridiculous premise for a movie (that is shared by this film's bigger sister The Core, The Day After Tomorrow and Sixteen Candles) but it is close.

As for the special effects guys I know the CGI lava looks bad and the model subs are wanting but if you're going to put the characters in a lava tunnel perhaps one without actual lights attached on the walls would be better. And what kind of underground mine was that anyway? It looked like a Styrofoam tunnel house.

The movie simply falls apart at the end with nuclear weapons once again coming to the rescue and a Yellowstone finale which was one of the funniest things I've seen all year. Magma is average in a field where the competition is awful.",1268179200,,2035,4.610497237569061

Great movie!!",1238889600,2,91,6.0
2672216,3,B000JJ4W3I,"Obviously done on the cheap. For example; In a scene where there were supposed to be multiple explosions, was really one explosion done at different angles. Would have worked fine if they had bothered to check the background, and noticed that the extra that got hit in the first explosion, was the same extra that got hit in the second and third explosions.
It's like this throughout the entire movie. Very poor film continuation, weak plot and cornier than a bowl of popcorn. And it's so obvious.
Good for a laugh at the special effects, which again were definitely done on the cheap.",1235433600,4,585,4.689320388349515

2672218,1,B000JJ4W3I,"I am horrified by the thought that somebody might take those ""scientists"" seriously and actually believe in what this movie tries to tell.  Let me pick just two of the many utterly wrong things: 1. Yellowstone sitting on the continent's biggest fault zone? I don't think so.  Yellowstone is a hot-spot, like Hawaii, thousands of miles away from fault zones and anybody who took geology 101 would know the difference.  2. Black smokers in the Mariana Trench?  So far, black smokers have been found on the ocean plateau, at about 6,000 ft depth but nowhere near the trenches.  Oh, one more thing: the Virginia Class submarines shown in the movie have a maximum diving depth of 800 feet, nowhere near the depth of oceanic trenches.  Enough.
I understand that a B-Movie's budget doesn't allow for a high-class scientific advisor, but any college student could have done a better job than whoever authorized this piece.
One scene I really liked: ""There was a time when the scientific community unanimously agreed with the flat earth theory.""  Apparently, we didn't go very far ever since.  If this movie had claimed our earth is a cube, it wouldn't be much further from the truth than the story of this sad piece of entertainment.",1183161600,3,1225,4.827751196172249
2672219,2,B000JJ4W3I,"I am notorious for liking bad natural disaster movies... but this is awful, even for me. The effects were awful (the opening sequence is just ridiculous), the acting very poor, the overall effect is not very interesting. The best acting was done by Xander, but this performance was mediocre for him. I just wasn't impressed at all. I'd rent this before thinking of buying it. I'm sure glad I did.",1169337600,15,396,4.671428571428572
2672220,3,B000JJ4W3I,"Originally airing on the Sci-Fi channel, this is another one of those disaster movies with a wholly illogical scientific basis and mediocre special effects.  As a disaster movie, it also fails to deliver any real scenes of personal crisis or danger, leaving us with a talky treatise on governmental incompetence.

Xander Berkeley is quite good as the heroic scientist whose theory of cataclysmic disaster is rejected by other scientists; Reyko Aylesworth is very good as his estranged wife whose own life may be in peril; and Amy Jo Johnson is the oh so bright graduate student.

While certainly not a classic disaster flick, it's an okay timepasser.",1167523200,7,650,5.05607476635514
2672221,3,B000JJ4W3I,"I won't spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it so this review will be short.  Having seen this movie on the Sci Fi Channel, I can say it is about average for a made for TV disaster movie.  It starts off good with an interesting premise and quickly goes downhill as the plot become cheesier and cheesier.

The only bright spots in the entire movie are the characters played by Xander Berkeley and Reiko Aylesworth who most people probably know from the Fox show ""24.""  Despite the mediocre script and ridiculous plotline, both manage to shine in their roles.  If you're a fan of either Xander or Reiko, the movie is worth purchasing.",1166054400,9,640,4.530434782608696

2672253,1,B000JJ4W3I,"This is an incredibly bad volcano disaster from Sony, worse than most Asylum productions. It seems the earth has eaten a large double burrito and is trying to get rid of it. As the core expands, magma is coming to the earth and will kill all the mommies, puppies, and kitties. And like everything else, man has caused this, which wasn't really explained as somehow toxins in the crust have made it down near the core. Amy Jo Johnson provides the token smart girl and eye candy. Yes, and nuclear weapons must be used with precision. Seriously?

The CG effects were bad. The guy who burns up in beginning was laughable. There is one scene where kids are standing in front of a painting of Old Faithful constantly blowing steam, it was so pathetic looking. Didn't anyone see how bad that looked?

The film has some camp appeal. Certainly students of volcanology could have a party watching this film.

2672260,3,B000JJ4W3I,"I'm always looking for disaster flicks, good or bad, that I can add to my collection.  This one falls into the middling category of `just okay'.  Sadly, it suffers most from a general lack of urgency.  The story takes far too much time setting everything into play and then fails to deliver anything spectacular in the way of a real disaster.  Yes, they do squirt cartoon lava everywhere like syrup on a pancake, but that's not nearly enough for this type of movie.  A disaster is supposed to be just that.  There is absolutely nothing unique here to differentiate this movie from similar offerings in this genre.  Fortunately, the cast is amiable enough.  Xander Berkeley does offer a certain gravitas to his role of a volcanologist who struggles to get anyone to listen to his secondhand theory of ""Exodus"" wherein all 1,500 volcanoes on Earth could erupt around the same time causing a huge mess.  He just loves to talk and talk and talk about it (some unnecessary gobbledygook about man releasing dangerous toxins that sped up the tectonic plates.......actually, I lost all interest after he started mentioning dinnerware).  Needless to say, something went wrong and it's up to mankind to fix it using that old standby for instant repairs........when in doubt, nuke it.
I found it entertaining enough to house in my collection (anything staring a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger can't be all bad).",1404864000,3,1397,4.906382978723404

2672277,2,B000JJ4W3I,"I'm going to lay my cards on the table from the beginning.  I'm a big fan of Amy Jo Johnson, and she hasn't made a lot of movies, so I found myself stuck watching this one.  I really wanted to like this movie, but honestly, it was a disaster - pun intended.

I don't usually like natural disaster movies because I don't find volcanos/earthquakes/fires/floods/asteroids/blizzards/etc. to be particularly compelling antagonists.  Yet, I thought it might be ridiculous fun like ""Volcano"" or ""Armageddon"".  But the movie doesn't really find the proper tone, and thus, doesn't work from a plot standpoint.  There are also some things that are just not plausible throughout the story (and that is while giving them a pass on the overall premise).

The acting was pretty good, especially given the clich-filled dialogue and poor character development they were given to work with.  As I mentioned, I'm always going to like Amy Jo Johnson (I won't even feign objectivity when it comes to her), and Xander Berkley did a fine job as well.  Yet both actors are failed by either the screenwriter or the director, as the chemistry is ""off"".  That is to say, the characters that have actual chemistry with each other don't end up together.  So when they are paired-up romantically with others, it seems forced, contrived, and disappointing.

I'm not a big special effects guy.  Character and story are much more important to me and I am usually willing to overlook bad special effects.  That being said, these special effects are really weak.  The graphics in this film are akin to my old Atari 2600.  So if you are banking on special effects to ""wow"" you and possibly salvage this catastrophe, look elsewhere.

I have mixed feelings about the scenery.  At one point, they go into a cave that is so clean and neatly structured that I wondered if it was filmed in the line for ""Splash Mountain"" at Disney World.  They go into a nuclear submarine that looks like it was constructed with poster board and neon stickers from ""Office Depot"".  On the plus side, they were in a few exteriors that were reminiscent of where the Pink Power Ranger used to fight the Putty Patrol.

If you are going to watch this film, you had better be a REALLY big fan of Amy Jo Johnson or a direct relative of someone who worked on the movie.  Otherwise, there are better options for your entertainment.",1342137600,,2364,4.728606356968215
2672278,5,B000JJ4W3I,"If you fly to Florida and rent a car with a Florida tag for your vacation (meaning: dropping all your money somewhere within the borders of Florida), you are cordially welcome as long as your money holds out.  If you move to Florida, drive exactly within the traffic laws and re-register your car in Florida as soon as you have an address, even if there are 11 months left on your tag.  You'll save money in the long run.  Drivers with out-of-state tags are alligator kibble for every city policeman and Highway Patrolman in the state.  Apparently, North American dinosaurs were naughty, so first the Almighty scraped off a piece of Africa as it floated by and stuck it on the butt end of Georgia, thereby creating Florida.  When that didn't straighten out the dinos, the Almighty just killed 'em all.  I don't know why he didn't send Florida back and keep the dinosaurs; maybe the magma is a bit more subtly humorous, but it takes awhile to cook.

2672279,4,B000JJ4W3I,"This is a low budget film with low budget, mostly unknown actors.  Still, they do an acceptable job dealing with a sorta-bad script.

2672280,2,B000JJ4W3I,"For some reason, the Earth's core has become unstable, and rising internal pressure has caused an increase in volcanic activity at weak points in the crust, around the world.  Magma: Volcanic Disaster (2006), asks that you believe that man has the ability to affect the course of volcanic activity.

Scientist Peter Shepherd (Xander Berkley) and his team happen to be on site at some of the hot spots of volcanic activity, and develop a theory that explains the pattern of events.  To spice things up, there is some minor drama involving the reporting of findings to the President.  And Shepherd has some personal trials, losing a close friend to an exploding volcano, and is also working on repairing his relationship with his ex-wife (Reiko Aylesworth).

Realistically, what man can do when dealing with a planetary crisis like this is very limited.  The plan is to creating weak spots in the crust, using nuclear explosions, and promote volcanic activity at the bottom of the ocean, where the least damage would be done.  Submarines from various nations launch nuclear tipped torpedoes, that trigger underwater lava flows.

Lacking scientific credibility, and with average special effects, there isn't much too reason to see this, except for Xander Berkley.  Berkley is a very solid actor, and it is nice to see him in a lead role.  It is also good to see Reiko Aylesworth (24).  Unfortunately despite the film's mostly solemn attitude, the story is just too goofy to be taken seriously.",1279670400,,1490,4.991902834008097

8150786,1,B000JJ4W3I,"I will admit up front that I have NOT seen this flick. But reading the description, I can tell it would be a dog.

I personally am sick and tired of the obligatory male-female duo who save the day from a natural disaster movie. It destroys my suspension of disbelief. These movies are all so formulaic. Natural disaster occurrence is predicted/identified by one of the duo, they come up with some totally improbable scheme to stop said natural disaster, and save the day (if not the earth), with or without government assistance. UGH!

I enjoy the more realistic natural disaster movies where the disaster is unavoidable and unstoppable. A story that has decent SFX, a sound premise, and deals with humanity's efforts to survive the disaster.

Films like Supervolcano (dealing with Yellowstone's eruption & the aftermath), Dante's Peak, The Day After, even 2012. San Andreas was good in the fact that the disaster happened but lost me when the Rock & his wife (obligatory duo) were able to find their daughter in the wreckage of LA. The Core wasn't too bad, though jump starting the core's rotation with nuclear bombs bordered on the WTF line. Even Volcano (the one with Tommy Lee Jones & Ann Haish) was good, right up to the point that they stopped the lava flow with concrete road barriers & firetrucks. Really? Maybe the authorities in Hawaii should try this to stop the lava flows now hitting them. It barely crossed the WTF line, IMHO.

Films like Magma, the endless types of Tornado movies or Ice movies that always get resolved in an improbable way may be good for the lulz, but that's about it.

I'm just waiting for the movie where our intrepid duo stop the mega-tsunami that will be generated when the Coumbre Vieja volcano on La Palma from collapsing into the Atlantic. Maybe they'll use a 10k vat of super-duper Gorilla glue to hold the volcano together. Or maybe they can use that super-duper glue to fill in the San Andreas fault an prevent an earthquake. Could a few gigantic doorstops prevent the tectonic movement of the North American plate over the Pacific plate and there fore prevent volcanic eruptions and earthquakes? I am also anticipating the comet/asteroid/meteor swarm movie where we're saved by putting a gigantic net into orbit to catch all of the incoming objects.

In closing - a bit more realism would go a LONG way. There doesn't ALWAYS have to be a happy ending. One final thought - why do there always have to be a love interest involved? Why can't there be two strong female characters (I'm thinking of Ann Haish and her fellow scientist in Volcano), or just two male scientists, or a mixed duo without the love? Is your movie so weak you have to have something else to keep viewers engaged?",1525824000,,2727,4.718487394957983
