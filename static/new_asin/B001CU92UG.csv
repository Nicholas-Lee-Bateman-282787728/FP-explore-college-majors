8289898,5,B001CU92UG,"The Real Flying Tigers tells the story of the lives and exploits of the American men and women who volunteered to defend China in the early days of the Second World War as members of the American American Volunteer Group in China.  This was America's first foray into the world of covert warfare and the most successful one to date.  This little group of Americans became the source of the only ""good news"" in the early dark days of America's involvement in WWII.  The documentary ends with the belated bestowing of medals from the US Government in 1996 in Dallas, Texas.  It was the largest medal ceremony in the history of the US military and was presided over by then Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Ronald Fogelman.  Truly a good hour of television - it includes quite a lot of film footage and stills shot by the actual participants.",1256083200,11,837,4.553333333333334
