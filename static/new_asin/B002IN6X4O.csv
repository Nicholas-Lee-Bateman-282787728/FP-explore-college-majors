8371040,5,B002IN6X4O,"My husband & I have been married 10 yrs and have 3 small children. Of course like everyone else the beginning of our relationship was great then I got pregnant which meant tired, stressed, fat & frustrated. I lost self confidence in myself & our relationship took a nose dive. We spent more time with the kids than with each other. We drifted apart...our family suffered.

We lived like this for a long time and no matter what we tried we couldn't snap out of it ...UNTIL I found an ad for the SEXY WORKOUT!! I wasn't sure how good it would be but it really is fantastic. It is such a relaxing workout that I can actually do with my husband. The moves just feel nice, the music is great, the stretches feel great.

We have been doing this DVD a couple of times a week for a few months now. We are closer, in better shape, less tense around each other, and overall happier. We can do something fun together that is good for us and helps our sex life.  It really helped put our sex life back on track and I feel so much better as well!

I just thought I would share this little find, and hopefully other couples can give it a try...it REALLY WORKS.",1252454400,7,1146,4.195454545454545
