8719641,1,B00Z9HSGP0,ONE OF THE MOST BORING I HAVE WATCHED.  I WONDER IF TAKEI EVER DID ANYTHING ON NANKING AND WHAT THE JAPANESE DID TO CHINA ALONE,1516579200,,127,4.08
8719642,5,B00Z9HSGP0,"A remarkable reconstruction - aided by interviews with survivors, within a time frame when all WWII stories will soon be crossing from the realm of oral history, into strictly archaeological time frames. This film preserves a history that could otherwise easily have been lost. (C. Pellegrino, forensic archaeologist, Hiroshima, author of ""To Hell and Back: The Last Train from Hiroshima.)",1498262400,,389,5.5
8719643,3,B00Z9HSGP0,"3 stars only because of the agenda demonstrated by the documentary. In the description of the movie they only talk about how the ""bomb"" affected the Japanese way of life...what they don't mention is how the Japanese way of life at that time had to be destroyed. Talk a bit about the Bataan Death March or the Rape of Nanking or Cabanatuan or any of the countless other atrocities committed by the Japanese during WW2...how about a little balance once in awhile Takei.",1477353600,,467,4.63855421686747
8719644,1,B00Z9HSGP0,I bought it for my students and it's more of a story of the people and places prior to the bombing.,1463184000,,99,3.761904761904762
8719645,5,B00Z9HSGP0,"I just finished watching ""Message from Hiroshima."" It is a wonderful story, moving and horrifying. I found the interviews with the survivors powerful and tragic, but was surprised to find myself feeling comforted by their quiet heroism and acceptance. The producers (Senoo and Farquhar) have done a remarkable thing in putting together this film. What a towering achievement and a wonderful tribute to the Japanese survivors and their families. I'm glad that the ground zero of Hiroshima is now a lovely park. It's similar to the 9/11 monument, but so many more people died at Hiroshima that I am reluctant to even make the comparison. Some of the art that was produced after the tragedy were among the most powerful images to methe dark paintings were such a contrast to the lovely little drawings of street scenes depicting life before the bomb. As the viewer in the animated street scene, you are propelled down the street, which makes you feel part of the beautiful city. Masterful. Everyone should watch this film.",1442880000,2,1019,4.964912280701754
8719646,5,B00Z9HSGP0,This was good only because it really does show we should never use that bomb again in the world.  This was sad but an education.,1441843200,,128,4.12
8719647,2,B00Z9HSGP0,Nothing special. much better out there everywhere.,1439596800,,50,6.285714285714286
8719648,5,B00Z9HSGP0,Touching stories from those who lived at Ground Zero.  Hard to imagine their loss and lives after that tragic event.  The cgi re-creation of the neighborhoods is a nice backdrop to the stories.,1439078400,3,193,4.818181818181818
