8170296,5,B000MDFM0I,"I picked up this box set awhile back and I love it. Its worth grabbing just for ""Welcome To Hell"" alone, but getting the other three, including ""Jump Off A Building""? Come on, this is a no brainer! These are the videos that changed the face and attitude of skateboarding. Besides you get the oh-so-hilarious Elissa Steamer crying like a little girl when she eats pavement and who can forget Jamie Thomas' 50-50 grind into eternity at the end. One last great feature is the ridiculously awesome bails footage at the end (its some seriously painful stuff). Cheers!",1192579200,,562,4.744897959183674
