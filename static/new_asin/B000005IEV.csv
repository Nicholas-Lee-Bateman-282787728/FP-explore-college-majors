1184606,5,B000005IEV,"One reviewer was upset by so many ""effeminate"" homosexuals in the film.  I think he totally missed the point!! Many of the male characters in the film were supposed to be putting on a play.  The story is a ""play within a play"" .Many of the male characters were supposed to be playing females in order to tell a 'true' story.  They were supposed to be acting and portraying female characters; not effeminate homosexuals!  The film does not even imply that the male prisoner characters were even gay!  The truly (known) Gay characters in the film (the bishop and the lead prisoner telling the story) were not stereotypically effeminate.
Side note (me on my soapbox): There are masculine and effeminate Gay men.  To paraphrase a great man of history: ""People should be judged by the content of their Characters, not by the color of their skin (OR any other trait like degree of effeminate or masculine behavior)""",1324944000,2,909,4.75796178343949

1184608,5,B000005IEV,"There have been plenty of other reviews going into detail about the story, so I will focus on the one thing about this film that just floored me: the acting. As others have said, it takes place in a prison, where the prisoners kidnap a priest and put on a play about his own youth for him, when he betrayed one of his friends and allowed the boy to be convicted of a murder he didn't commit (and yes, the friend he betrayed is one of the prisoners).

As the ""play"" unfolds, the movie switches to ""real"" flashbacks, but with all the prisoners still playing the roles -- so even all the female roles are being played by men. If you've ever wondered if it was possible for men in drag to play serious roles without over-the-top camp, watch this movie. It's just breathtaking.

Note that the trailer for this film (you can find it on Netflix) is *not* good and makes the film just look strange and goofy. Don't let it put you off the film.",1292630400,4,935,4.27683615819209
1184609,5,B000005IEV,"This movie is not for the simple moviegoer looking for some light entertainment. Lilies spins a sophisticated story of love, betrayal, vengeance, and repentance. While the themes are compelling, the underlying homosexual story device will stand in the way of many viewer's enjoyment of the complexity of the story and artful presentation. Imagine a play within a play within a movie...and you're only scratching the surface of what this has to offer. While not all of the performances are stellar, some raise above the rest and truly drive the viewer into this fantasy romance. The open and astute viewer will love the intelligence of the film and the daring of the director to take on this subject matter and presentation. Viewer beware, this will require your full attention to capture the essence of the story; multiple viewings will continually reveal deeper nuance and subtlety. You will either LOVE this movie, or you won't understand it at all.",1290816000,5,951,5.063694267515924

The resulting product is disappointing. I was left wondering as to the relevance of many scenes, and decided that the whole thing reflected some one's ego trip/  Probably someone in production. The story line is unrealistic and unbelievable, which is so in many movies, but the viewer is never convinced otherwise, as is the job of a good director and/or producer to manage. This movie fails on those accounts and left me bored and wanting it to finish as soon as possible.",1285632000,2,671,4.775862068965517

1184612,5,B000005IEV,"Lilies is a play, made into film, centering around inmates acting out a play in a prison. Seemingly complex, the simple premise of the play is of actual events concerning a couple of the characters forced to confront sins of the past. Overlaying surrealistic imagery into the play allows the viewers to experience the events but anchors them in the actual setting, the prison. As with most plays, it is vitally important to pay attention to the dialog. However in this film, the imagery competes creating a perfect symbiotic relationship so that we can see clearly the internal struggles of each ""player"". This is exemplified in the initial scene which identifies the institutions of prison and church as being the same. Both locking ""threats"" in and/or out while at the same time forcing conformity to a set of preconceived social structures and forcing repentance on those held in these boxed environments. Dealing with ghosts of the past, created by intense hurt and obsessions, the characters are forced to reckon with reality, no matter the price to pay. It is obvious we are dealing with forbidden love and obsession, but it is the struggle itself that is the focal element. Beautifully well crafted, the film exposes, then challenges, the delusions we internalize in order to conform and be accepted by family, society, and ourselves.

The imagery of Lydie-Anne dropping from the heavens as one sent from God (Eve created for Adam) to counterbalance Simon's real and enduring love for Vallier is perfect. As well as the pious conflicted Bilodeau crying out to an indifferent God at the balloon alter, which represents, at least in his mind, God's will manifest. And like many frustrated hypocritically religious people do, decides to become the judge, jury, and executioner of those who exemplify the conflict he has within himself. Replete with symbolism, the film is a pleasure to watch and should be viewed again to see what may have been missed the first time. ""Play the Part!"".",1279756800,3,1989,4.990963855421687
1184613,5,B000005IEV,"I was intrigued by the product description and read a few of the other customer reviews so decided to give this one a try. I'm glad I did. Although not the greatest movie I've ever seen, the approach to the story was unique (it reminded me a lot of how the film version of Man of La Mancha was presented) and it's beautifully photographed. The acting is what I was most surprised about, though. Everybody gave their all in playing their characters and it really shines through. If you're looking for full frontal male nudity, you'll only get one brief scene. If you're looking for an engrossing film, then definitely take a look at this one.",1279065600,5,641,4.5344827586206895

1184615,5,B000005IEV,"When I first starting watching ""Lilies"" I began wondering what the heck I was getting myself in to as a prison bishop is held hostage in a confessional and is forced to watch what appears to be a play being staged in the chapel.  But sticking with it, this film turns out to be an amazing gem of a movie that uses a unique style to tell what is ultimately a very tragic story.

The play turns out to be about the younger lives of the Bishop and the prisoner that has taken him hostage.  The film switches back and forth between the prison chapel and the same actors playing people in the real-life world of the protagonist's youth.  Being a group of prisoners, both the male and female roles are played my men - sometimes playful and sometimes tragically dramatic.

Gorgeously photographed, artfully acted, cleverly staged, the film draws you in until you can't stop watching.  The love story between Simon and Vallier is very sweet and is accompanied with a couple of beautiful and romantic lovemaking scenes, and of course Jason Cadieux and Danny Gilmore in those roles are not at all hard to watch.

An engaging, beautiful and luxurious film.  You may buy it initially for pretty boys and skin and sex, but this film is so, so much more than that.",1265328000,4,1250,4.524444444444445
1184616,5,B000005IEV,"This is definitely one of my most favorite movies.

If you want to read about the storyline in great detail, there are plenty of them listed here.  I however, want to share my thoughts about the overall production values.

The casting was fantastic.  The actors seemed like they were molded to play the characters they played.  The sets are dreamlike (when appropriate) and clear as a bell (when appropriate).  There was lushness mixed with raw sewage

The story line is so moving & every single actor in the cast put in a superb performance.  I find myself helplessly drawn into the love passions between the two beautiful main characters - Simon x Virreal.  It is a movie that I definitely have watched over & over again, totally riveted.",1258070400,,569,4.380952380952381
1184619,5,B000005IEV,"I've watched this movie at least 30 times. There is nothing quite like showing it to a friend or date who has never heard of it nor seen it. Without exception, they've always been as thrilled with and moved by this masterpiece as I was upon discovering it for myself back in days of video tape. It is one of those rare works of film art that demands repeated viewings; even now I still get something new from it with each added showing. After all this time, LILIES still leaves me in awe.

A cinematic ""play within a play,"" it is superb example of the filmmaker's mastery of technique. Transitions between past and present, between prison and real life, between costume-wearing inmates and actual characters ... all of these segues are as smooth as the surface of the glass from which a movie camera's lens is made.

The actors are as close to perfection as actors can be.

While leaving a few minor puzzles in its wake (I've never fully understood the matricide scene but great films SHOULD leave questions in our minds), the script effortlessly sweeps the viewer along through joy and ultimate heartbreak to the stunning and open-ended denouement of the cowardly Bishop Bilodeau forced to exact a self-inflicted penance of his own choosing while Simon walks away from him in disgust.

LILIES is a truly beautiful experience depicting a great tragedy of star-crossed male lovers. It is my favorite gay movie of all time and quite probably my favorite all time film of ANY genre.",1247961600,,1479,4.72093023255814
1184620,4,B000005IEV,"I don't like to promise much from a movie like ""Lilies. This because it is so confusing- it's a play they made a movie within which is a play and kind of surreal movie. This made me watch Lilies 5 times bfore I actually""got it"". And it was worth it each time- almost like a personal detective adventure trying to figure out who is who and what is what.
Bottom line- it is wonderful- a moving love story and living characature- and a warning for the squimish- it is completely male gay, with men playing the female roles. The plot is fsscinating, intricate, passionate, human and humane with some obvious religious overtones. The lead actors are modestly handsome, the two leads on the jacket cover.
The plot is intense.
Please PAY ATTENTION- the first time and maybe you only have to watch it three times- and enjoy every breathing second.",1242691200,,839,4.6
1184621,5,B000005IEV,"One of the best films -- let alone one of the best gay films -- of the last 15 years, Lilies is, at its heart, a love story.

It is 1952 and Bishop Bilodeau (Marcel Sabourin) arrives at a Quebec prison to hear the last confession of Simon (the amazing Aubert Pallascio) a dying man who, forty years ago, was tried, convicted and imprisoned for the murder of another man in a small, rural town. When the Bishop takes his place in the prison confessional, he comes face to face with Simon, hardly dying and, as the Bishop comments, much older than when they had last seen one another.

The stage is set for an impressive story. The remainder of the prisoners (with the implicit permission of the prison guards and the prison chaplain), lock his holiness in the confessional and what ensues is a trip back to 1912 where we learn that the Bishop and Simon knew each other all too well. Bilodeau is forced to watch as the prisoners reenact his and Simon's past and the events that led up to Simon's incarceration.

In a nod to the age of Shakespeare, the prisoners assume the roles of both males and females, showing Bilodeau the truth of those days: how young Simon (Jason Cadieux) was befriended by young Bilodeau (Matthew Ferguson, with a maniacal intensity), who desperately wants Simon to join him in the seminary; how Simon has a befriended another young man named Vallier (performed with heartbreaking honesty by the spectacular Danny Gilmore), the son of an eccentric countess (Brent Carver) who has lost everything in life but her adoring son; how the triangle of three men -- two in love with the beautiful Simon -- can only lead to tragedy.

Greyson as director doesn't confine us to the prison. The film moves fluidly from the cold gray stones of incarceration to the breathtaking beauty of the French Canadian countryside as a lady of means, Lydie-Anne (Alexander Chapman, wonderfully warm, yet icy), arrives by balloon and sets her sights on Simon. Torn between wanting to better his station by marrying Lydie-Anne and his fearful, honest love of Vallier, Simon finds himself in the middle of a powder keg as Lydie-Anne and young Bilodeau set in motion the events that will tear apart his life.

Cadieux, as the young Simon, is definitely the bee-stung lips eye-candy of the piece, and the movie would have been made better with a stronger actor. Still, he is quite effective and, for those who keep score of these things, you get some rear nudity. The standout is Danny Gilmore as Vallier who should be a massive star. The most moving moment for me is when Vallier, alone in his room, professes his love for Simon in a poem, and is discovered by his mother who mistakes the ode as being dedicated to a long lost father. Gilmore is also very easy on the eyes and you do get to see all of him (literally and figuratively). The script does get a tiny bit muddled in the end, but the photography, the performances, and the directing are spectacular from beginning to end. Director John Greyson (of whom I'm not particularly a fan) does his best work guiding all of this, resulting in a lyrically beautiful film.

Rarely are coming-of-age films this good or this inventive. Give it a shot. I would be surprised if you were disappointed.

1184622,5,B000005IEV,This is a very passionate story between same sex lovers.  It has all the drama and all the unthinkable pains of reality.,1195084800,,120,4.454545454545454
1184623,4,B000005IEV,"LILIES, based on a Canadian play 'Les feluettes' by Michel Marc Bouchard, has been adapted to the screen by Bouchard and placed in the sensitive hands of director John Greyson, an artist who is able to indulge in surrealism with reality and make it work well.  This very beautiful film is cast entirely with men despite the fact that there are women roles in the story. How does he make that work successfully without pandering to artiness? View this little film and make the discovery for your self.

Set in Quebec in a prison, Bishop Bilodeau (Marcel Sabourin) has been summoned form the outside to hear the confession of 'a very sick man' who has been imprisoned for 40 years for a murder. Upon the Bishop's arrival the audience knows something is amiss: despite the atmosphere of the prison as a stage accompanied by choral singing of plainsong (The Hilliard Ensemble) there are props and images that seem out of place in a grim prison.  The Bishop is ushered into the confessional booth and when he opens the window to hear confession, the person in the seat is Simon (Aubert Pallascio) the 'very sick' man who has planned for the bishop to watch a play depicting the 40 year old crime - a reverse on the confessional stance.

Through a small aperture in the bishop's now locked confessional, the Bishop is forced to watch a reenactment of the incident 40 years ago when two young boys, Simon (Jason Cadieux) and Vallier (Danny Gilmore) were in love and the young future Bishop (Matthew Ferguson) was jealous of Vallier's attention from Simon and played a key role in 'murder' of Vallier that resulted in Simon's being accused and imprisoned.  The atmosphere leading up to this act includes the reaction from the small town's homophobia and to Simon's sexual ambiguity that involves a strange lady Lydie-Anne (Alexander Chapman) who arrives form Paris via an air balloon.  It is the interaction of the boys with the townsfolk, the new lady arrival who desires Simon's affections, and Vallier's understanding and self-sacrificing mother Countess De Tilly (Brent Carver) that leads to the fateful death of Simon.  How the story ends in the confessional booth reversal is the beauty of the film that must be left unsaid for the drama to affect potential audiences of this movie.

The cast is all male because the whole story is a mise-en-scene, a play within a play, where all parts are acted by the prisoners for the sake of displaying truth to the Bishop.  There is no pretense at making the men look like women except for the costumes and this enhances the message of the story. The actors are excellent and the impact of the story is powerful.  Yes, this is a highly honored gay-themed film, but it is really more about the power of love both in youths and in thwarted adults that makes it a film for all audiences.  Highly Recommended.

1184624,5,B000005IEV,"This beautiful film is so lyrical, it's almost like watching a poem. Everything about this film works: the script, the directing, the cast, the look. This film gives new meaning to the gay feature film genre.

Based on a play, Lilies retains a stage feeling as the premise is a play-within-a-play. Whereas the audience is not required to use it's imagination as much while watching the film as it was when watching the play, the film does require an open mind and the ability to suspend disbelief. If you allow it, Lilies will take you on a very special ride as seldom films do or can.

The chemistry between Jason Cadieux (a much under-used young actor) and Danny Gilmore (mainly known from French-Canadian television) is remarkable, making their tragic love-story all the more moving. Special mention needs to be made to Tony Award-winner, Brent Carver, who's portrayal of the delusional Countess De Tilly is the stuff that Oscars should be made of.

The plot and dialog are almost Shakespearean. The incorporation a St. Sebastian last minutes of life (as a play) into the plot of the film gives the movie the perfect strength and passion necessary to understand the feelings of the two main characters. All three main roles played by the young actors are of Oscar caliber. The music is only perfectly represented in each scene and if these were not enough, the dramatic supporting roles of the mother and the Countess are magnificently acted and, at the same time, bring enough ""camp"" to the movie to make its dark plot histerically funny. Not enough? The art direction and photography are so beautiful that I wish I could get a chance to see this movie in a big screen.

1184633,4,B000005IEV,"This movie is a ""play within a film"" that juxtaposes two time periods, often combining the two. The film begins in Quebec in 1952, where a Bishop has been summoned to a prison to hear an inmate's confession. The chapel is filled with other inmates, and the Bishop goes to the Confessional. While there, the rest of the inmates, plus the Chaplain, lock the Bishop inside the confessional so that he can view the inmates acting out a re-creation of the events that intertwine the Bishop and the convict's lives.
We discover that the convict, Simon, knew the Bishop as a young boy in 1912, when they were students at a boy's school. Simon was in love with a fellow student, Valier, but the future Bishop also lusted after the enticing Simon. Simon is punished by his father for loving another boy, and agrees to a sham marriage. But, ultimately, he is drawn back to his true love, Valier. This leads to the conflict, the death of Valier, and Simon being falsely imprisoned for murder of his great love, all due to the bitterness of the Bishop.
This film is highly unusual in that you see the inmates performing the play in the chapel, then you see the same actors sent back in time to 1912, playing the same parts. Then, you will see the Bishop and the older Simon observing the events of 1912. There are no women in this film. Even in the flashbacks, the inmate-actors portray both male and female characters.
This is not an explicit gay film, by any means. Although there is one very tender, passionate scene of the young Simon and Valier kissing intensely, while naked in a bathtub. The majority of the film is about Simon's past, and bringing the truth out to the dupilicitous Bishop. The acting and photography are excellent, and while the story may be a bit difficult to follow at first, you will need to keep in mind that we are seeing the convicts portraying this tale, even when we go back in time.
It is a very romantic, very well-made, and also a very tragic film.",1039478400,4,1972,4.511173184357542
1184634,4,B000005IEV,I own this movie and every once in awhile really enjoy watching it again.  It is not your typical gay movie like Trick or The Birdcage.  It is more intelligent and well done.  The quality is first rate and the movie feels more like a big buget production.  The story is is one of a group of prison men who reinact a love story between one of the prisoners and his first love that was ended by a preist in their younger days.  The movie is all a flashback to what happened in the past and is done very creatively.  It's not a comedy and its not camp.  Get ready for a moving and interesting movie.

1184635,5,B000005IEV,"An evocative, beautifully shot, and well acted love story.  The movie opens in a prison, where a bishop has been invited to hear a convict's confession.  Once on prison grounds, the bishop is confronted by that same convict, Simon, for whom he has lusted unrequittedly when they were childhood friends.  What follows is the retelling of a tragic love triangle and the devastating events which led up to the imprisonment of Simon, the death of Vallier, his lover, and the bishop culpable role in them.
Unlike many other movies with a gay theme, this one is very well acted.  Young Simon, played by Jason Cadieux, has dark hair, dark eyes, and is drop dead gorgeous.  It is easy to see why he is the object of every man's lust.  But the one who really caught my attention was Vallier, played by Danny Gilmore.  Though pale and a little thin, he is ethereally beautiful.  What's more, Gilmore and Cadieux has such an erotically charged chemistry that is not often seen in any cinema.  Although not as sexually explicit as some others, the bathtub scene is as sensual as any I've seen.
This is a wonderful movie, one of my favorites.  The only down side is that it has such a sad story line.",1024185600,21,1187,4.556603773584905
1184636,4,B000005IEV,"As a mother, it is very difficult to hear the words ""I am gay"" from your child. Apart from your own family, same sex relationships are acceptable. My child is gay. I have to admit, I was very disappointed when she first broke the news. To be gay means putting yourself in a place of prejudice and hardship. There are still many conservative people in our country who cannot and will not accept same sex relationships as part of our world and possibly even biology.
Though this film is not about a lesbian relationship, upon seeing it I was filled with much more hope and understanding for my daughter. I know she will still be faced with adversity but I trust she will pass through it with grace.
THank you so much for giving this mother a sense of relief!",1021248000,8,756,4.4071428571428575
1184637,5,B000005IEV,"Lilies has to be the best gay film overall I've seen and it leaves me struggling for words to adequately express my appreciation other than to urge others to see it for themselves. I had read many positive reviews before ordering the DVD, but still I was not prepared for how good this movie is; the film could not possibly have won all the awards it deserves.
Simply put, Lilies is captivating from the opening scene
The cast is excellent, particularly the two leads, Jason Cadieux as the young Simon and Danny Gilmore as Vallier, but there isn't a weak character in the film. Matthew Ferguson turns in a powerful performance as the young Bilodeau and Brent Carver is magnificent as the Countess in delicious supporting roles.
The transitions from present day to flashback and back again transpire so beguilingly you find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is exceptional, to say the very least. This is good filmmaking, regardless of the subject matter.
Lillies is not my sentimental favorite gay film, however; in fact, it's a bit of a downer. The love story within the story is beautiful, as well as being beautifully told and acted. Most focus on the extraordinarily handsome Cadieux as the young Simon, but the real heart of the story is Vallier, without whom Simon is just another pretty boy, as he comes to realize. The character of Vallier is nailed, absolutely, by Gilmore, who is fetching in his own right. His confrontation of Simon in the bathtub scene at the end is as powerful a scene as any in gay cinema. The intensity of passion and nuances of emotion Gilmore brings to this scene, as well as his entire role, are riveting.
But the confrontation between the older Simon and Bilodeau is less uplifting. I am not a Catholic, so I am not being defensive, but I found this twist of the story a bit too easy, a bit too much of a cliche, and I did not feel the older Simon's need for revenge nearly as strongly as I felt the passion of the young Vallier.
These objections having been stated however, if John Greyson (or anybody for that matter) has ever made a better gay film, I would like to know about it.",1010707200,37,2148,4.567357512953368

1184639,5,B000005IEV,"I accidentally saw Lilies about five years ago when it was released on VHS in Canada.  Me and my friends who had no idea what we were to watch, sat in silence for the two hours of this film with our jaws on the ground.  Lilies remains one of my favorite movies, always causing catharsis.
This is a piece of theatre on film which, unlike many movie musicals or plays put on film, transfers beautifully and clearly.  The conventions used in this film highten the truth and beauty captured in Bouchard's [stage] script.  Though in the first few minutes of the play there may be a few unanswered questions, everything becomes clear--more than clear; poetic.
The acting is this film is beautiful.  With a cast of mainly unknown actors, the subject matter is handled sensitively with a delicate touch.  The central relationship of Simone and Valier is well defined and very well acted.  Brent Carver proves his brilliance repeatedly in all his work, whether it's on stage or on screen.
I am a little tongue tied when I think of this movie becuase I get moved everytime I replay the story in my mind.  It is powerful and beautiful.  If this review has meant anything, let it mean that this movie could leave you speechless.",999820800,29,1216,4.618604651162791
1184640,4,B000005IEV,"""Lilies"" is actually two stories going on at the same time. One is the story of a prison convict who asks for a priest to hear his confession, only to bewilder the priest with events from their shared past. The other story is one of love and passion, of betrayal and mistrust, of devotion and connection; the list goes on. The visual integrity is a vision beyond that of any love story I've seen to date, making this a very convincing and masterful production.
The film begins with an elderly Bishop making his way to a prison to hear the confession of an inmate. Once in the prison church, it strikes him as odd that a private confession have so many witnesses in the chapel, but once he makes his way to the confession box, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary religious procedure. The convict, Simon, has a plan of revenge for the Bishop, and the chapel is transformed into a stage, the prisoners its actors.
The story is that of Simon's life before prison, from his teenage years to the events that brought him to confinement. Simon is a sexually confused adolescent with whom the waifish Vallier is madly in love. Vallier is thin, pale and very emotional, and becomes severely depressed once Simon decides he must start ""liking girls."" He goes along to the charms of a French countess, who desperately holds onto him to fulfill her fantasy of love.
But a forced love never lasts, and Simon soon learns this. His willingness to satisfy his father's expectations are a burden to him, as is young Bilodeau, who regards his behavior with Vallier as sick. Simon soon gives in to his heart, realizing that he loves no other than Vallier. So how does the Bishop tie into the story? This I will not reveal. It is easy to guess what part he plays in the overall scheme of things.
But this predictable story twist makes the movie's love story no less affecting. This is a story of a love that could never be torn apart, a love that knew no bounds, one that met its match and won. And on the emotional side, it's quite touching to see scenes involving the two lovers handled in a less-explicit manner than most other films.
The movie makes convincing transitions from the past to the present, and even some crosses between the two. The past is brought to life by the actors of the prison, and certain scenes are staged like a play in the chapel while others are seen in Simon's mind's eye. Director John Greyson brings visual flare to the film, though some will find it difficult to make the transition. But if you're on Greyson's wavelength, then the film takes on a sumptuous and tasteful appeal.
And the cast is a work of art in its own. Young Simon is played by Jason Cadieux, who shares an electric chemistry with Danny Gilmore, playing Vallier. The two are believable as lovers, and equally as moving when they are separated from one another. Older Simon, played by Aubert Pallascio, is hardened by silent rage over his lost love, while the Bishop, played by Marcel Sabourin, is convincing in his fear over the situation. And Matthew Ferguson makes Bilodeau such an annoyance that we know he will come into play later into the film.
""Lilies"" is a visually sumptuous treat that many will dismiss, but others will love. There is fire within the romance of Simon and Vallier, one that cannot be matched by many other romances in mainstream films. The present day story is a nice outlet for the memories of a man haunted by his first and only love, and the silent hatred for his enemy.",997056000,78,3486,4.543720190779014

You really had to pay  attention. I had to watch it again to pick up all the things i missed. It  is extremely interesting in the way the story is told and the way it is  shot.
It really captures the love between these two men. Both with the  camera and the actors.  The actors are all committed to the  fantasy aspect  of this film. They are playing a character, playing a character,  I highly  recommend this film, but watch it twice!",966038400,8,702,4.315384615384615
1184642,5,B000005IEV,"At turns lyrical and pretentious, this daring and extremely literate film works best for lovers of extreme gay romanticism (much like Derek Jarmon's film Edward II--and just as self-consciously artsy.)  Based on a modern  French-language play, it uses a wide variety of striking narrative gimmicks  to create a fable-like atmosphere, telling the story of a doomed teenage  love affair - and the older men who are still caught in its aftermath 50  years later...
If you love heavy theater, if you can imagine swooning  over Alfred Douglas or Gaveston, if the pop lyrics of Morressey make you  cry rather than roll your eyes-this movie may be exactly up your alley.  It's one of my favorites.
A guilty pleasure of the most refined sort.",963187200,10,734,4.9105691056910565
1184643,4,B000005IEV,"The story goes like this: a bishop is held captive in a prisonchapel and is forced to watch a re-enactment of a romanticrelationship between two young men that took place years ago--and is forced to deal with the repercussions of it's tragic end.
Quite frankly, the greatest strength in ""Lilies"" is it's clever presentation, and it's efforts to put a slightly different spin on what might otherwise be a predictable story.  Since all the parts being played in the re-enactment are portrayed by prison inmates, all the women are actually men in drag.  Add to that, the segues between the confines of the prison stage to the authentic locale of the flashbacks we're witnessing are seamless to the point of being unnoticable.  I've never seen flashbacks presented in such a way, and it's very much appreciated (thank you, John Greyson).  Also, while it would be easy to take pot-shots at organized religion in such a story, ""Lilies"" doesn't take that route.  Human weakness, not religion, is the villain in this film.  Rather than the church being the tool of the tragedy which unfolds, it winds up being a refuge.
All the actors do a decent job, but Jason Cadieux is a stand-out as Simon.  He does a great job at conveying the turmoil he feels (and he's damn sexy, too!).  The one glaring weakness in the story is the character of Simon's lover's mother.  At no point does this woman make any sense to me at all.  In short, she's a loon and I don't know what real purpose she serves.
However, ""Lilies"" isn't about her.  It's about the bishop and a love he took part in destroying.  The story isn't exactly new, but the presentation is so compelling you can't help but get swept up in it.",958348800,33,1685,4.617449664429531

1184647,5,B000005IEV,"After seeing the film for the first time last week, I found myself desperately searching the Web for information on this Actor.  Oh sure, Jason Cadieux is very pretty, but I think the  film focuses on the tragic demise of the character Vallier.  The film's director Grayson, has almost  manipulatively imbued Vallier with characteristics that we all would surely  long for  in a partner, and Danny Gilmore has taken that direction, and  fulfilled it beyond our greatest expectations.  This characterization is so  positive that it reaches the point where good drama dictates that in order  for this movie to succeed so completely, Vallier has to die - the most  sympathetic, innocent, and sweetest character to grace gay-cinema in years.
To be truthful, I'm almost fearful of finding more information on  Danny Gilmore - the actor.  Besides the obvious - that he's probably  straight, such information will possibly damage the image that I have of  him - as Vallier.  Actors, especially GOOD actors (his first role, mind  you), have to put up with fans relating to the characters the actor  protrays better than to the actor himself, as a person, out of character.  I'm just hoping since Vallier was so convincing, that there almost has to  be similar personality traits in the Actor.  Who knows?

1184649,5,B000005IEV,"Lilies is an astonishing, emotional, and surprising story of two gay men's intertwined lives.  The director has artfully woven scenes from the past (1912) into the present (1952).  Suprisingly, characters from the present  who are unrelated to the story of the past are used to portray the  characters in the flashback scenes.
The two men's lives are irrevocably  changed by the events of the past.  Forty years of anger cause one of the  men to exact revenge upon the other.  The form of revenge, however, is far  from typical. It is an emotional, rather than physical, assault upon the  antagonist.
