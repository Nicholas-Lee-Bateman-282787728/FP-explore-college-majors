3717364,4,B001NFNFJO,"its not a thriller or a comedy by any means.  its a slow movie, all drama and dialog.  fairly predictable at the very end too, but it gets the point across really well, and that is our lives are what we make of it nothing more nothing less.  its one of those movies that once you're done youll just be happy that you have a sidewalk to shovel instead of complaining that its cold outside.",1261180800,,388,4.1466666666666665
3717365,4,B001NFNFJO,"There was only one other review so I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth.  It has decent dialogue and acting, it's thought provoking and the main character is a cat lover.  It has the sparseness of a play since there are only 3 characters not counting the cats. It wasn't a waste of my time.",1246924800,2,295,4.157894736842105
3717366,4,B001NFNFJO,"I was actually surprised by this little indie that no one has heard about or seen. It has a straight-forward premise of learning some life lessons and trying to educate those that are down on their luck. They picked two ideal candidates to play the roles of teacher and student, but both in the worst possible way.

Quaid plays a hitman who decides to take his assigned mark (played by Baruchel in only the way he can with those Joshisms and characteristics unique to his acting) on a journey of learning before he carries out the ugly deed. The majority of the film takes place in Quaid's vehicle driving to their end destination in the woods. So yes, there is roughly an hour of conversation in a moving vehicle, but by the end you feel it all served a purpose, some see it coming and others do not. In that sense, the film was actually made well enough to spur discussion, yet seem believable.

The only real fault I heard was Quaid's Aussie/NZ accent slipping in and out well over 100 times, but I guess that is authentic (in reading the variety of discussions out there). There are some comedic moments but I feel this film is far from being classified as a comedy. The disc supplements give some insight on the process and the quality of the overall DVD is well produced.",1236211200,3,1277,4.476394849785407
8326793,5,B001NFNFJO,"well-acted, little known film that just keeps drawing you in. the ending was a surprise with a twist (guessed some of it). should watch once at least for randy quaid performance, as it is unlike any he has done before. would like to see him return to acting.",1470787200,,258,4.395833333333333

8326796,5,B001NFNFJO,"The ending is not what you expect. I won't spoil it for you by saying more than that. Just watch it. This is a very enjoyable movie especially considering that it's a low-budget film. No hyper-action, no CGI or special effects. Just two men driving around in car and the conversation they are having. Exceedingly good acting by both Quaid and Baruchel. I will be very disappointed if this film doesn't go on to become a classic.",1451001600,,428,4.571428571428571
8326797,4,B001NFNFJO,Surprisingly good movie.  Might be a little slow paced for some since 90% of the movie takes place in a car and consists manly of dialogue between 2 actors but all and all a really good movie.,1432512000,,192,4.1891891891891895
8326798,5,B001NFNFJO,Hilarious!  If you have ever een poor and resentful you will LOOOVE jay B's character. Even if you haven't he is LOL funny.  And Randy Quaid is wonderful playing an insightful helpful character to Jay's train wreck. There are so many funny parts and the plot's premise is amazing!  I am truly surprised that this was not up for an award at Caanes.,1431561600,,347,4.476190476190476
8326799,5,B001NFNFJO,This movie is great... Or it might just be that I love Jay :),1405987200,,61,3.4285714285714284
8326800,2,B001NFNFJO,I don't know what I was thinking when I purchased this ! I have seen Jay and Randy in other films and I really like them . -- But this film is just slow . If this were to happen in REAL LIFE -- there would be pure panic !! There were just phony-balony acting skills by both actors . Could of been a better movie if it had 2 other film stars .,1405641600,,342,3.635135135135135
8326801,5,B001NFNFJO,"i saw this movie a few years ago when it first came out and there were still real video stores around.
real happy to have found this and highly recommend it to anyone",1390003200,,166,4.0606060606060606
8326802,5,B001NFNFJO,This is a very good drama. It is not a comedy or an action thriller. It is slow moving drama that keeps you riveted to the screen at all times. Both the actors fit their parts perfectly. It is the perfect movie for all those who have made mistakes in their lives. It has a moral that it teaches you and does a good job. The only people who won't enjoy this movie are those that admire the talents of Kim Kardashian.,1310083200,2,415,4.073170731707317
