The teens don't want to be there, even more so when they learn there is pretty much no mobile phone or internet service there.  There's also pigs destroying the place which the now owner father wants to get rid off.  The other man's daughter does not agree with harming animals and thinks he's a pig himself for wanting to harm them.  The man's own daughter has a crush on her friend's father, and sets up events at a beach rave to get some alone time with him.  He's drunk and she seduces and sleeps with him.
