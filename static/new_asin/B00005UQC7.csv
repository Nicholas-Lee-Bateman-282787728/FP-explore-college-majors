1667968,5,B00005UQC7,"This wonderful film gets my nod when it has been nominated for academic award for the best foreign film 2000. I have watched this movie today and really excited to write a review. It's an inspirational, coming-of-age, story about Chief's pursuit to look after the people in his village Dolpa and the obstacles in his path. I have been to Dolpa, infact I have seen these people around having same kind of life. The people in the movie are real and their customs are real too. The story has been greatly supported by mind blowing scenic view of Nepal and its culture. The himalayas, villages, Foksandu lake are real and it has become the heart of this movie. On top of that this movie also reflects the culture which is dying at this information age. Thanks for the director and photographer for creating such a nice movie.",979084800,19,821,4.591836734693878
1667969,5,B00005UQC7,"I lived in Nepal for over two years and had the oportunity to visit Dolpa, the district where this movie takes place.  I have to say, without reservation, that this movie is accurate in it's portrayal of the people and their struggles.  I saw it for the first time in Kathmandu where it ran in the major movie theatre of the city for two months before being released internationally and I knew immediately that I wanted to own it.  Watch it and be changed.",975110400,4,456,4.404761904761905
1667970,5,B00005UQC7,"This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I was entranced and moved. It exemplifies what the art of cinema should be. I saw it at the Tokyo International Film Festival in Shibuya today. Beautiful, real, and unpretentious. No review can do it justice. See it on a big screen if possible.",972777600,,296,4.4
1667971,5,B00005UQC7,"i saw this wonderful film on the plane on the way back from india, and i've been trying to find it ever since. this simple and affecting story of  a chief's attempts to save his village from starvation affected me deeply,  as it will anyone who has had their fill of hollywood trash. it is superbly  filmed and captures the harsh natural beauty of the 'land of snows', and  deals sensitively with the universal themes of loss, mourning, and human  endeavour. if you've ever been to the himalayas this film will bring it all  back, and if you haven't been it is enough to make you want to go. i can't  recommend it enough!",967420800,16,621,4.394736842105263
1667972,5,B00005UQC7,"Saw it in London but have been to Himalaya.....this film is thebest film I've seen in a long, long time and totally captures the fierce majesty of the Himalaya.

1667973,5,B00005UQC7,"I saw the movie in Paris in a cinema. It is amazing. I was very, very impressed. In fact it is a kind of documentary. I am sure it was incredible  difficult to make it in such high altitude circumstances. It gives you a  really good picture of the way of life of the people living in Himalayas. I  hope it will be soon available on video",966384000,5,337,4.0
1667974,5,B00005UQC7,"Like Justin Henkel, I saw this film in Kathmandu, Nepal for a full house.  Caravan is an amazing film dipicting the Dolpopa people of Northern Nepal.  These are my people.

1667976,5,B00005UQC7,"I saw this movie in a theater in Kathmandu, Nepal. It was a packed house  and was one of the greatest experiences while I was there. The story has  great visuals, and story line. I can tell from experiencing Tibetian and  Nepali culture that this movie is a great representation of the family bond  and lifestyle.",954374400,2,313,4.535714285714286
1668007,5,B00005UQC7,"I give away me copy of HIMILAYA as a gift...again! I agree it's indeed a great story, including breath-taking scenery....but, I'd also like to find the ""other"" movie (title unknown?)..to also add back into my 'library' of DVD's.
  Both films have glorious and more subtle information that helps us understand their lives:...despite their harsh climate, life and altitudes! The two movies provide rich information about their lives:  clothing/fabrics, cooking methods, eating & foodstuffs, and also the different kinds of shelters - some tents, some vertical, stone towers  to cope with deep snows..are all additional, visual-rich pieces of this story -
  I'm hoping to find/recall the other  film - equally compelling - about the gathering of Himalayan salt; a vital trade-good! The  'fields' of salt are from a long-ago ocean that was land-locked, dried up! The dramatic, annual treks are to gather the salt! It is an ancient tradition... The unusual landscape, and harvesting in a place where a unique language has developed/and is still spoken(?) - allowing men(only), from different cultures to communicate....and share news, make jokes, discuss changes in their remote, very separate lives.",1418515200,,1195,5.421621621621622

1668013,3,B00005UQC7,"This is a decent if predictable story, simple and not particularly subtle or engaging. The cinematography is nice; not as spectacular as it could have been, considering the photogenic location, but pretty. My big complaint is with the white-on-light subtitles. They are difficult and often impossible to read. I find being unable to understand the dialogue greatly detracts from my enjoyment of any film. The format is also super-wide angle; viewed on my wide-screen monitor as a ribbon across the center with deep black borders at top and bottom. This makes the subtitles (as well as the action) smaller and even that more difficult to see. I'd cut off the sides if I could figure out how, but don't think my monitor permits that. All in all, rather disappointing, especially considering all the 5 star reviews.",1388534400,,812,4.977941176470588
1668014,5,B00005UQC7,Done all in Nepal one of THE most beautiful places on Earth and some of the most Beautiful people.  The story is simple about a village of mountain folk who earn their living by collecting salt and selling it down in the city. When the eldest son of the tribal leader dies in an accident the very old father must take over in the perilous journey.  There is a lot of love and heart her as well as grand photog.  Do not look for stupid Hollywood CGI junk no shoot out or any of that.  But these are a very tough strong lot of folk including the women.  A fantastic film.  Note in Nepal it was called Caravan,1384992000,,606,4.093220338983051
1668015,5,B00005UQC7,"This is not your glitzy everyday movie.  It is about real people that live in the Himilaya mountains

1668016,5,B00005UQC7,"Oh my goodness - how did they film those mountain scenes? The director and cinematographer made it appear to have been done on location. The story is about a clash in leadership and generations. With the towns annual trading trip threatened by the loss of their informal leader to death, a new young brash leader steps up and says follow me; the old sage leader says no, follow me. This story follows the struggle over the mountain in snow to save the town's resources and income. Gripping!",1383868800,,490,4.64367816091954

1668037,5,B00005UQC7,"As an admitted Tibetomaniac, I have found it hard to find anything on film/DVD about Tibet of the past other than short black & white film clips or cartoon animations. Himalaya is spot on. It very accurately depicts the culture, mores, and societal interactions of the Tibetan nomads of the past in what turns out to be a ""thriller."" Will the nomads be able to move across the mountains in time to avoid the coming blizzards? Should they follow the advice and instructions of the elder of the group, or listen to the younger, stronger up and coming leader? The costuming, village sets, and mountain scenes (filmed in Nepal) are extremely accurate. I know this is one I will watch again and again; highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Tibet, or mountaineering.",1380931200,,772,4.768656716417911

Great supporting characters - the monk/painter and Tinle's daughter in law.",1368489600,,285,4.5

1668043,5,B00005UQC7,"This movie is mesmerizing as you view it. It is the story of tradition versus progress and how the two merge. It is showing this played out  in the Mountains of Nepals in the region of Doplo and show how leaders are born. It is absolutely glorious and takes you to a region not on a tourist map. It is the story of wisdom being passed down from elders, initial rejection of it, and then learning that the way is to merge the two.

The movie introduces a civilization known to only a relatively few people.

1668074,5,B00005UQC7,Well done and enjoyable to us after traveling to Nepal and hiking on this Salt Road.  Little information is available on the culture.,1311465600,,133,4.782608695652174
1668075,4,B00005UQC7,"The annual trek over the mountains to exchange salt for grain splits a community between its elderly chief and a rebellious young aspirant. Old customs vs. new thinking supposedly conflict; actually, neither is omniscient. The tale told also has hidden, unexplained inconsistencies. Nonetheless, the film is worth watching for the excellent photography that covers both the scenery and the lives of Tibetans living high in the Himalayans.",1305244800,,438,5.552238805970149
1668076,5,B00005UQC7,Saw this some years back in the cinema and wanted it for my DVD collection. Very nice film with beautiful pictures and equally beautiful soundtrack.,1304467200,,148,4.96
1668077,5,B00005UQC7,"This film was just all around wonderful. The magnificent setting of Tibet is spare and windblown, rocky and wild. There seems nothing superfluous about the lives of the people and the country in this film. What I got from the story was lean and meaningful. A spiritual masterpiece in it's visual and emotional impact. All of the characters are real, multidimensional, sympathetic and engaging, busy in the art of living their lives to the very fullest, right down to the bone.

I highly recommend this film. My favorite line, that keeps resonating with me the day after viewing (and this may be paraphrased)is, ""All good leaders go the wrong way in the beginning"". It is the spirit of rebellion and passion, mixed with recklessness and ego of youth that is tempered into the wise and trusted servant/leader of the people. This is a great addition to any spiritual library.",1302480000,,872,4.852348993288591
1668078,5,B00005UQC7,"This DVD proves that one doesn't need techno gimmicks and computer graphics to create a sense of grandeur. The towering Himalayas that give this movie its title have been magnificently filmed, leaving one breathless with the natural beauty.

The simple and classic story-line (power struggle between a young and old leader; more subtly, the struggle between the spiritual old ways and the brash new ways) also show that the best story-telling is not necessarily the most complex.

The ""Making of"" section astounded us by revealing that the performers were not professional actors. As those in the lead roles created  compelling and charismatic characters, this was a complete surprise. There was never an instant that I wasn't completely involved in the struggles of the characters - even the vast herds of yaks had my sympathy!

The melodious soundtrack deserves a special mention, for it added extra depth to an already powerful movie. Sub-titles were good and easy to read.

Against the backdrop of these indomitable mountains, one comes to realise that, physically, we are such transient beings, but that -like the charming, irrepressible old leader Tinle - the human spirit is as indefatigable as the mountains themselves. After this movie was finished, I felt as if I'd enjoyed 104 minutes of blissful meditation.",1301788800,,1319,5.202830188679245
1668079,5,B00005UQC7,"This is an absolutely superb film.  Visually spectacular and uncontrived, it not only brings the scenery to life but is instructional for anyone interested in other cultures.  I learned a lot from this film and thought I was reasonably informed about lifestyle in Tibet.  How wrong I was!",1282694400,,288,4.958333333333333
1668080,5,B00005UQC7,"Himalaya is most worthwhile for its portrayal of the lives of the people of this remote region. The plot is almost inconsequential compared to the place - the incredible mountains where the drama unfolds. The special feature that shows the making of the film is a must-see, as it reminds the viewer that this story could have taken place 100 years ago or yesterday. Fascinating look at a world most of us will never experience first-hand.",1265500800,,438,4.776315789473684
1668081,4,B00005UQC7,"I can't bear to rate this less than 4 stars, because the film is so good that it deserves a wider audience. Other reviews are spot on: script, acting (even the amateurs), cinematography, and music are all splendid, and the film's ethnographic sensitivity to Nepalese culture is deeply affecting. Considered purely as a piece of cinema, Himalaya rates an easy 5 stars. However, this DVD transfer is a 2-star product at best. I viewed Himalaya in three different theaters, and it was each time one of the sharpest, most impressive film images I'd ever seen; Kino should be roundly criticized for taking such a magnificently beautiful film and giving it a sub-standard transfer like this. Detail level is poor, and the interlaced image is a surprising disappointment for a 2002 printing of such a visually stunning movie. Kino, you should be ashamed.",1263427200,,847,4.971830985915493
1668092,4,B00005UQC7,i got a copy that was dubbed in mandarin with chinese subtitles.  it was a bit difficult to follow.,1222905600,,99,4.2105263157894735
1668093,3,B00005UQC7,"The film, set in a remote Himalayan village in Nepal, is gorgeous start-to-finish, a labor of love by those who made it over a long period of time. The cinematography gets a lot of good ""press,"" and rightfully so, but what I really enjoyed was the soundtrack. I expected the good visuals, and got them, but I didn't expect such wonderful music.

As for the look, it's different, with rugged barren mountain village terrain and snow-topped Himalayas in background. What's really different, however is the fact the film employed no professional actors. These were real people of that area! They are fascinating faces you won't soon forget.

As for the story, the treks don't begin until 45 minutes hav gone by in the film. You have to be patient.  I's an adventure story that will reward you if you can hang with it that three-quarters of an hour. It also will make you grateful you weren't born in this part of the country.",1188950400,3,922,4.644171779141105
1668094,5,B00005UQC7,"As filmcraft, this film could use tighter editing and more skillful camera work (not to mention a bigger budget) to make it a more viscerally involving experience.  I did find the plot a tad simplistic and the subtext (=both the old and the new have their own place in harmony with each other, and are not separate from each other) rather pat and clumsily expressed.  It helped that as a practicing Buddhist I already had a keen interest in this place and people, for someone wholly unfamiliar with this subject area this film might be on the slow side, with more of a documentary feel.

However, it is a very rare treat for Western audiences to gain exposure to the stunning natural beauty of Tibet and the fascinating culture of its people (also very beautiful) on film---especially a film entirely devoid of cheesy Western characters and storylines.  That alone makes it worth watching.

4 1/2 stars!",1166572800,2,903,4.762820512820513
1668095,4,B00005UQC7,"I have been an avid hiker and armchair mountaineer for a decade, and have read many accounts of Tibet and Nepal, so was jazzed to see some of the austere beauty.  The story is wonderful, the scenery SPECTACULAR!, the acting very good.  But with S&H, this costs $30--way too much.  If it was Cliffhanger, Caddyshack, Butch Cassidy, etc. (the kind of movie you watch 4 or 5 times a year), I could understand the price.  I will watch this movie perhaps another 3 times in my life, probably to introduce someone else to it.  Great movie, but rent it if you can.",1163030400,,557,4.421568627450981
1668096,5,B00005UQC7,This is a beautiful movie about life:  about growing old and learning to let go; the conflict between the new and traditional beliefs; and the tension between the young and the old.  It also demonstrates that true communication between people does not need many words.  This human drama is set in a backdrop of the magnificent Himalayan mountains.  The attention to detail in this film is amazing.  I have watched it six times and discover something new every time.,1162080000,3,465,4.8354430379746836
1668097,4,B00005UQC7,"For those of us who are hikers, ""Himalaya"" is a real treat.  Beautifully filmed--as they were climbing with their yaks, I only wished that I had been there.  The mountains of the Himalaya are a dream for most who hike--a sense of what God must have chosen above all else to be His best.

The Himalaya mountain system is the planet's highest and home to all fourteen of the world's highest peaks, including Mount Everest.

At times, the Himalaya's grandeur and majesty--and brutality too--reminds one of the Antarctica shown in the ""March of the Penguins,"" which of course has become a classic.  When one hikes, vistas are seen like those in this film, which reinforce the fact that God exists and each of us is blessed.

Without giving away too much of the story, at one point the trail falls away and it is literally straight down.  Anyone who has hiked the somewhat-wider trails of the Grand Canyon, for example, knows that feeling well.  An experienced hiking partner of mine got vertigo; and I certainly did not get any closer to the edge than I had to--nor look down in some spots.

It is partly a love story, and a story of the generations, and the mountains of which they are a part.  It is small wonder that it was nominated for an Academy Award as ""Best Foreign Film.""

The scenery is spectacular--and it rates ""four stars"" for that alone; the acting is terrific, certainly given the fact that most are first-time actors; the photography is excellent, which captures life at the ""top of the world""; portable altitude chambers were used to keep members of the film crew healthy at more than 19,000 feet; and the temperatures were freezing.

Yet, it is a beautiful film and a tribute to those who made it; and more importantly, to those who live in the Himalaya full time, about whom their story is told.  Last but not least, there is a fine ""Special Feature"" by Debra Kellner, about how the film was made and the difficulties that were encountered, which ought to make any wannabe filmmaker take heed.",1156464000,4,2009,4.625352112676056
1668098,5,B00005UQC7,"Always interested in Himalayan culture I picked this movie up in my DVD store and saw it right after ""Kundun"". Unfortunately comparisons are inevitable, but I really don't want to make it between these two beautiful movies.

Once on a time, in a remote village of the Himalayas, there was a man who lost his first son and heir.... The story starts like this. A simple story that has been enacted through the ages, in different cultures and written by many storytellers....And there was a child who wanted to be a chief, and his mother who fell in love with her father-in-law's enemy, who wasn't an enemy at all...

The story is there, it's a good story, and then there are the mountains, the village, the lake, the yaks, the monastery, the people, the storm, the cold, the customs and the colors, the simply breathtaking beauty of the this world. Is it still present, or is it already a fairytale?

I don't want to get romantic, but this unpretentious, well documented and even better filmed movie really got under my skin.

Differently from Kundun, in this case we don't have to look at the meticulous reconstruction, the enormous cinematographical work, the historical correctness, the embodiement of the Authors poetics an so on. This movie is simply real, the Author in no way gets into the story.

I read Valli is a photographer, who worked together with his equipe to film what he really saw and knows. I think he is a great artist that can touch hearts all around the planet.

This movie is a cultural opening to an ancient civilization but it's also a great fairytale for ourselves and our children.

By the way my daughters got up halfway through Kundun but never even breathed during this movie.

The faces of the actors are so perfect for their parts that we have to believe that they are real. Actors that are not acting but beeing themselves!

One last word on the ultimate meaning of the movie. What it means to be a chief: command on men, but following the will of the gods! Listening to the elders or believing in religion is not superstition. This message is always present in Tibetan Buddhism and the fact that it is the moral of the work shows how well Valli knows this civilization.",1150243200,2,2202,4.611253196930947
1668099,5,B00005UQC7,"This film has some of most breathtaking scenery ever filmed. Shot high up in a remote area of the Himalayas that has seen very few foreigners, it focuses on the Tibetan people who live in an area of the mountains called Dolpo. These people are referred to as Dolpopas. The love that the director, Eric Valli, has for this region of the world is palpable with the loving care and attention to detail that is lavished on this production. Shot at heights of up to 17,400 feet, this film is a tremendous achievement both cinematically and historically, as it locks in time a little known culture and way of life.

The story, which is based upon real life events, details a generational struggle between the young and the old. The storyline is simple. This isolated village is dependent upon trading its salt for grain, so that the village may survive. To do so, a caravan of yaks must make an arduous trek through the Himalayan Mountains to Nepal to effect such a trade. When one such caravan returns to the village, the caravan chief, is dead and his body has been brought back to the village by his best friend, Karma. The dead chief's father and tribal council memeber, Tinle, crazed with grief, suspects Karma of having brought about his son's death in an attempt to take his place as chief of the caravan. His dead son has left behind a beautiful wife, Pema, whom Karma covets, and a young son, whom Tinle wants designated as chief, despite his youth.

This sets into play a power struggle between Tinle and Karma, both of whom are headstrong and willful. After the traditional sky burial for the dead caravan chief, this clash of wills results in two separate caravans setting out on the salt trading trek. One is led by Karma who, accompanied by the village youth, defiantly leads his caravan out of the village before the date designated by the village lamas. The other is led by Tinle, who has persuaded his other son, Norbou, a Buddhist monk, to assist him. Accompanied by Norbou the elders of his village, as well as by his dead son's widow and young son, Tinle follows tradition and leaves on the date that the lamas have designated as being most propitious for the difficult journey. The film details each of the respective journeys, as well as the continuing battle of wills between the two leaders. The risks that Tinle takes on the journey in order to to catch up with Karma is captured in all its starkly beautiful, cinematic majesty and will leave viewers sitting on the edge of their seats.

Set against a breathtaking backdrop of Himalayan beauty, this is a must see film. The performances by those in lead roles are compelling. Thilen Lhondup, a real life former yak man who had fled Tibet during its invasion by China, is charismatic and powerful as Tinle. Gurgon Kyap imbues the role of the headstrong Karma with a youthful vigor and machismo. Lhakpa Tsamchoe, an exotic beauty who hails from Southern India by way of Tibetan parents, is wonderfully serene in the role of Pema. Karma Wangel is absolutely adorable as Tinle's grandson and will steal the viewers' hearts.

Anthropologically rich and visually beautiful, it took the director nine months to film this movie. The daunting logistics, the unpredictable weather, and the use of mostly non actors contributed to this being a time consuming project. In order to maintain as much authenticity as possible, this film was shot entirely on location and the villagers even wore their own clothing in the film. The director's care and effort paid off, however, as this is one of the most stunningly beautiful films ever made. The musical score by Bruno Coulais is haunting, capturing the soaring majesty of the region, as well as some of its mystique. It also offers what I believe to be Tibetan throat singing, a somewhat esoteric form of singing/chanting not often heard in the western world.

This film, which was first released under the title ""Caravan"", was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. I believe that it lost to Pedro Almodovar's film, ""About My Mother"", which is also an excellent movie. Having seen both films, however, there is no doubt in my mind that Valli's film should have been the one to walk away with the Academy Award. It is a must have DVD for those who are interested in other cultures, the Himalayas, and, quite simply, a great film. Bravo!",1148688000,4,4373,4.718586387434555
1668100,5,B00005UQC7,"It is the outstanding cinematography of the Himalaya Mountains which creates the most profound effect on the viewer ... but equally powerful is the story of how the people in this Dolpo village make a long arduous trek via caravan to trade salt for grain. It is how they sustain their lives in the starkly naked mountain village where they reside. The dangers of this journey are all too real ... yet the people in the village courageously embark on the journey ... knowing the risks and the hardships ... battlng the elements and ultimately facing nature herself, learning to work with her forces to ensure their own survival.

The chief elder Tinle learns of the death of his son after the return of a caravan from such a journey ... He becomes despondent and accuses one of the young men of failing to protect his son from death during the journey. Although other men who were there told Tinle that Karma the caravan leader had done all he could to save his son, Lhaka and had even placed himself in danger to bring back his body, Tinle is not convinced. The preparation for another journey begins but Karma and Tinle disagree on the timing of the journey. Karma convinces a group of young men to embark early due to avoid possible snow storms. Based on past experience and the advice he sought from the Buddhist monks, Tinle leaves four days later ...

The most emotionally satisfying and beautiful aspects of this story revolve around relationships, one being how Tinle and Karma each grow as human beings when they lead a band of men, women, and children on this arduous but life-sustaining journey through steep mountain trails with deep gorges below them. Another is the fascinating story of why Tinle sent his other son to a monastery to become a Buddhist monk and how their father and son relationship comes full circle. The reason the son chooses to join his father's caravan is heart-warming, despite his not having been prepared for this particular lifestyle. The attraction between Karma and Pema, the widowed wife of Lhaka, is one more ""story within a story"" that is explored. Also moving is how Lhaka's young son helps resolve some issues surrounding power/leadership that is earned ... and power that is given to a person based on birth and status.

When the caravans leave the village, the weather is balmy ... the grass is green, they even set-up tents for an overnight rest. Eventually each leader, Karma the younger one, and Tinle, the elder village chief, encounter challenges as they prepare for the coming snow storm which is inevitable. Before the film ends, they each develop a strong bond and respect for the courage displayed by the other ... The ending of this story is very satisfying and emotionally moving. This film has a profound impact on the viewer because it deals with universal human emotions, family relationships, survival of individuals after the losses associated with death and the indomitable human spirit that overcomes adversity - all within a remote, visually stunning and beautiful part of the world. This is a very deep and spiritually moving film.

It's not like anything is unclear here or like we need a basis in the culture or religion to understand this, but on the other hand he doesn't try to explain too much either. He just lets the story unfold and brings us along with it.

The cinematography was great. The mountains are both things of beauty and spirits and gods and challenges to be reckoned with. In a way this is the story of two stubborn men and the people they effect. As such it's universal, and the message it leaves you with could come from any culture. But it's wonderful that that can be woven in with a trip to a very different, interesting culture. That's what world cinema is about, and this is a fine example.",1123545600,2,863,4.496815286624204

1668123,5,B00005UQC7,"This film, in addition to being a beautifully told story gives onlookers a chance to see what life in the Dolpo (the Tibetan region of Nepal where Himalaya was filmed) is really like.

The movie begins with a salt trade caravan returning from mainland Nepal.  Pema (Lhakpa Tsamchoe of Seven Years in Tibet) discovers that her husband, Lhakpa has died on the trail and his friend Karma has returned alive.  Lhakpa's father, Tinle, is sure that Karma set up Lhakpa's accident so that he could take on Lhakpa's position as chief.  Karma wants to lead the next salt caravan, but Tinle insists on doing it himself with the help of his younger son, Norbou, who has spent his life as a painter in a mnastery, and also bringing along Lhakpa's son, Tsering/Pasang.

However, despite this fantastic and engaging plot, the movie really revolves around Pasang.  Pasang is only around 8 or 10 years old and his only understanding of his fathr's death is taht his father will be reborn in the land of Padmasambhava and that it is now Pasang's turn to be chief.  The story follows him as he goes on the trail with his mother, uncle, and grandfather.

The story also follows Pema and Karma, who were once close childhood friends, now seperated due to Lhakpa's death.  Pema must deal with her father-in-laws terrible anger at Lhakpa, as well as her son's admiration for Karma, who can shoot the bow and arrow.

While the setting of the dolpo is far off and exotic, the questions of raising a family, what is best, and where to lay the blame, hit close to home in any culture.  The questions of survival in the harsh dolpo and excitement along the trail keep this movie going.

I highly reccomend it!",1109289600,3,1682,4.60738255033557
1668124,5,B00005UQC7,"If you believe film should be an art-form, then you'll love Himalaya. As the director states in the bonus audio track, the production team did not identify and write to a ""target market"" when developing the screenwriting, they did not follow the dreary Hollywood ""recipe"" for filmmaking, and, most importantly, they DID use non-actors to portray almost all the lead and back-up roles. Tinle, the lead character, is a treasure. The first time I viewed the movie, I thought, ""what a wonderful actor."" His timing is exact yet unpredictable, his personality forceful, his face is exquisite, his form unique and authentic. A natural, I thought. Indeed, he plays himself in a quasi-autobiography, and what a wonderful character he is.

This is a movie about an ancient civilization we are losing and, sadly, will soon be lost. Really, its a documentary, and, as the director states, it will certainly be used by future historians as a visual artifact of what is soon to become the lost Dolpo civilization of Nepal. The soundtrack conditions you to this heartbreaking reality.

The movie is successful on many levels: a mother's lost love (who hasn't seen her adult child since he was eight); a loving grandfather/grandson relationship, which is painfully lost; a wife who loses her husband, and a young boy who loses his father then attempts to make sense out of the loss; a young religious man who chooses the ""difficult"" path over the easy monastic life; a classic confrontation between generations; an old man whose entire life is built on strength, perseverance, and admiration, but then who ultimately must let go of it all to those who are destined to succeed him.

I loved this movie. It made me think of my mother, an artist, whom I miss dearly. Himalaya is a work of art.

FYI - Eric Valli authored a feature article for National Geographic that details the story of the Dolpo. I recommend you check this out at your local library (yes, that great American institution currently under threat by invasive Republicans who would restrict your rights, by Libertarian Republicans who would de-fund libraries - given the chance, and by bible-thumping Republicans raised on hate who are raping Mother Nature in a quest to hasten their Armageddon myths.)",1106352000,3,2249,4.957559681697613
1668125,5,B00005UQC7,"On the surface this might seem like a movie to attract the art house set interested in a foreign location and foreign culture, but it is so much more.  It is a timeless tale capturing timeless issues of the human condition, regardless of cultural boundaries.  It is less about what it means to live in the Dolpo region of Nepal and more about the shift, balance, and tug between generations and the respect for tradition versus the pull of the younger set to move on.
The cinematography is exquisite.  The scenery is the stark dry beauty of the Himalayas progressing with the story further and further up into the elevated reaches of snow covered passes.  It is rare to see such beauty captured in other films.  The scenery alone is worth the price of admission.
As if the window into the Himalayas wasn't enough, the story line is finely told, finely acted, and finely directed.  There are scores of gems on what leadership is all about, how we sometimes have to bow to higher powers regardless of position, how the generations relate, how we mature, how we accept life and death, and how power shifts.  Besides the depth of the culture-transcending story, we still get a window into the world of what a traders village in the Dolpo region of Nepal may be like.  The oneness of life and the mountains, the salt and grain trade to sustain life, the reliance on the caravan, the system of chiefs, are all a wonderful way to gain a better understanding of another culture from the comfort of you living room.  If you already had a healthy wanderlust for that part of the world, the film will only serve to stoke those flames.
Eric Valli's ""Himalaya,"" is an epic beauty, a true masterpiece not to be missed.

1668126,3,B00005UQC7,"1st of all, if the rating system allowed it, I'd give this film 3.5/5 stars.
Basically, I thought that this was a pretty interesting film to watch, especially for someone who doesn't know anything about Nepalese culture; it vividly immerses you in their daily life, complete with all of the throat singing, the rituals, the houses, the prayer wheels, everything. It was really quite a sight, even though I didn't understand some of what I saw; the movie isn't a documentary after all, so it has no obligation to explain these things for western viewers, and it often doesn't.
However, since it's not a documentary about the life of Nepalese people, but a MOVIE, I'm going to review it as such.
Where the movie falls short, in my opinion, is NOT in its pace; I never felt that the movie demanded a lot of the viewer, and it should be a relatively easy viewing for anyone (provided that that  anyone doesn't mind subtitles).  Nor is it with the story; it is fairly exciting and features great character development.
Rather, I always felt that the director didn't really sympathize with his subject matter. The story is told, but it is always told from a distance; there is never a moment when the camera really zooms in on one of the characters to analyze their personality.  We get to see an exact replica of the traditional Nepalese village, but despite all of the material things of that culture that we see, the movie doesn't really show their day-to-day life, but instead romanticizes everything slightly; looks at all of it like a tourist would.  There is never a sense of real connection there, and I think that this movie could have been much better if the camera didn't always stay at an arm's length away from the characters.
If you're willing to forgive that, however, this film will show you more about Nepal than any other film you're likely to watch.  Not psychologically, perhaps (only some of that), but materially at least.  If you're even slightly interested, I say give it a try;  The scenery is indeed beautiful.",1081123200,5,2030,4.701408450704226

This is a first rate production that benefited from an apparently low budget. Much of Caravan's charm derives from its' simplicity.

1668129,4,B00005UQC7,"The title of this film is most appropriate.  A major focus of the movie is the trip taken by two groups of Nepalese villagers over the Himalayan mountains to trade their salt for grain to help them survive the winter months.
The first group is led by a vigorous young man, Karma, who is a candidate for chieftain of his tribe.  He is opposed by the leader of the second group, Tinle, the current chieftain, who is now old, but still convinced he has the energy to make the difficult trip over the mountain.
Tinle consults the gods for guidance and decides to delay the trip for ten days.  Karma convinces half the tribe to follow him and he leaves several days early.  Tinle drives his group hard to finally catch up with Karma on a distant mountain path where the climax of this adventure takes place.
At least half of the film shows us Tinle and his group fighting the mountain and the snow to make it over the pass to their destination.  The scenery is truly spectacular and this film is best seen at the movies or on the largest TV screen available.
One reason we go to the movies is to take us to far away places that show us people and events completely unlike anything in our experience.  Himalaya does just that.  We marvel at the strength and determination of these people who live life without any of the comforts of modern civilization.  How happy and content they are is uncertain because we see them fighting to survive against seemingly overwhelming odds, at least overwhelming to any of us brought up with all the comforts of home at our disposal.
Himalaya shows us that human beings can be incredibly strong and adaptive and the film encourages us to always take the harder of the two paths that are presented to us.",1041552000,4,1732,4.476190476190476
1668130,3,B00005UQC7,"So, how is dominance determined between two males? If they're running for political office, they grovel for votes - then take the final count to court. If they're prizefighters, they bash it out in the ring, with or without biting off ears. In HIMALAYA, each of two contenders races a caravan of yaks over treacherous mountains. Aren't men silly!
As the film begins in a remote section of Nepal, the body of village chief Lhapka is brought back to town after he died in a mountain accident. His father and former chief, Tinle (Thilen Lhondup), immediately charges his son's friend Karma (Gurgon Kyap) with being instrumental in the death so that he might assume the chieftanship. Now, it wasn't completely clear to me how the village leader was selected, except that an essential qualification was the ability to guide a yak caravan loaded with salt over the mountains to a market where the mineral is traded for the grain on which the village survives. Otherwise, the chief's position was perhaps hereditary, but confirmed by popular consensus. In any case, the question of who'll lead the next caravan is now at issue. Tinle is thought to be too old, though he vehemently disagrees, and his second son, Norbou (Karma Tensing), is a meek monk who only knows how to paint and pray. Lhapka's son, Tsering (Karma Wangiel), is but a seven year-old boy. Meanwhile, the village seers consult the gods and decree the caravan should leave in 10 days. Karma, somewhat of a hothead, convinces the village's young bucks to follow him with their yaks four days early to avoid the inevitable snow storm. Tinle follows with the old codgers (and their old yaks) on the appointed day. Tinle's group is accompanied by Norbou, Tsering and the latter's mother, Pema (Lhakpa Tsamchoe). Stubborness and macho pride cause Tinle to flog his caravan to a fast pace along a perilous route such that it can catch up with Karma's before both reach a crucial mountain pass.
The best thing about HIMALAYA is the scenery, and the bigger the viewing screen the better. With bright eyes flashing out of a dusky face, the next best is the exotic beauty of Pema. Otherwise, I'm not sure why the producers went to the trouble. This isn't so much a bad film as one just too long and unnecessary. No truth about the posturing to achieve dominance is illustrated that can't be observed by any conscious individual on a daily basis in national, office, peer group, or family politics. Perhaps the value of HIMALAYA is that it reduces the stage to one of stark simplicity, and clearly makes the point that the shifting alliances (Pema, Tsering) or wise advice (Norbou) of third parties sometimes renders the contest between adversaries to something no longer worth the effort. On a personal level, I was unsympathetic to the Tinle character whose leadership style seemed centered around shrill, indignant yelling. (No Shackleton or Churchill here.) So, whether it was to be good or bad Karma, I simply didn't care much from early on.

1668163,5,B00005UQC7,"This film has some of most breathtaking scenery ever filmed. Shot high up in a remote area of the Himalayas that has seen very few foreigners, it focuses on the Tibetan people who live in an area of the mountains called Dolpo. These people are referred to as Dolpopas. The love that the director, Eric Valli, has for this region of the world is palpable with the loving care and attention to detail that is lavished on this production. Shot at heights of up to 17,400 feet, this film is a tremendous achievement both cinematically and historically, as it locks in time a little known culture and way of life.

The story, which is based upon real life events, details a generational struggle between the young and the old. The storyline is simple. This isolated village is dependent upon trading its salt for grain, so that the village may survive. To do so, a caravan of yaks must make an arduous trek through the Himalayan Mountains to Nepal to effect such a trade. When one such caravan returns to the village, the caravan chief, is dead and his body has been brought back to the village by his best friend, Karma. The dead chief's father and tribal council memeber, Tinle, crazed with grief, suspects Karma of having brought about his son's death in an attempt to take his place as chief of the caravan. His dead son has left behind a beautiful wife, Pema, whom Karma covets, and a young son, whom Tinle wants designated as chief, despite his youth.

This sets into play a power struggle between Tinle and Karma, both of whom are headstrong and willful. After the traditional sky burial for the dead caravan chief, this clash of wills results in two separate caravans setting out on the salt trading trek. One is led by Karma who, accompanied by the village youth, defiantly leads his caravan out of the village before the date designated by the village lamas. The other is led by Tinle, who has persuaded his other son, Norbou, a Buddhist monk, to assist him. Accompanied by Norbou the elders of his village, as well as by his dead son's widow and young son, Tinle follows tradition and leaves on the date that the lamas have designated as being most propitious for the difficult journey. The film details each of the respective journeys, as well as the continuing battle of wills between the two leaders. The risks that Tinle takes on the journey in order to to catch up with Karma is captured in all its starkly beautiful, cinematic majesty and  will leave viewers sitting on the edge of their seats.

Set against a breathtaking backdrop of Himalayan beauty, this is a must see film. The performances by those in lead roles are compelling. Thilen Lhondup, a real life former yak man who had fled Tibet during its invasion by China, is charismatic and powerful as Tinle. Gurgon Kyap imbues the role of the headstrong Karma with a youthful vigor and machismo. Lhakpa Tsamchoe, an exotic beauty who hails from Southern India by way of Tibetan parents, is wonderfully serene in the role of Pema. Karma Wangel is absolutely adorable as Tinle's grandson and will steal the viewers' hearts.

It offers a terrific director's commentary, as well as a delightful and informative featurette by Debra Kellner on the making of the film.

1668164,5,B00005UQC7,"In a magnificent film that manages to combine elements of Shakespeare and a National Geographic special, Eric Valli tells the story of Tinle, the leader of a
Nepalese village, who upon the death of his son (and presumed successor) engages in a power struggle with Karma, a young rebel against tradition. Karma's
family has some sin their past, which I don't think is ever explained, so Tinle is distrustful of him anyway, but this bad blood is
only exacerbated because Karma was on the salt gathering trip where his son died.  Of Tinle's other sons, one is too young, Tsering, and the other is a Buddhist
monk, Norbou, so neither can take over for him.  Instead, Tinle determines to lead the caravan of yaks on the annual salt-trading trek himself, despite his
advancing years.  Karma, defying the omen-reading of the village's lamas, gathers some of the younger men and leads them and the yaks off with Tinle and a
motley party, including both sons, in hot (or bitterly cold) pursuit.
Mr. Valli has spent close to two decades photographing in the Dolpo region of Nepal (for National Geographic it is no surprise to learn) and
for this film he used mostly local non-actors.  He's reverent of the culture of the people, appropriately awed by the setting, and, amazingly
enough, manages to convey it all on film.  But don't worry, it's not some social studies project.  When Tinle takes a treacherous shortcut to try and catch up
with Karma it's as exciting as any Hollywood thriller.
Though he's a difficult man, almost Lear-like in his determination to dictate events after he passes, we root for Tinle, over the disrespectful Karma.  But when
Norbou offers the lesson of the film--""When two paths open up before you, always choose the hardest one""--we see that the two men, though locked in a
generational clash, are more alike than they or we first realized and that there's an unexpected continuity to the life of the villagers, a circularity entirely
appropriate to their religious beliefs, or vice versa.  The film ends up being as lovely in spiritual terms as it is in physical terms, and that's saying something.

1668165,5,B00005UQC7,"I rented and immediately purchased the DVD.  It is a movie, but it pays very close attention to the life of the Dolpo-pa, and as such, it not only presents a story, but captures a ""culture in time"" that few of us will ever experience.  We may walk through these people's villages, or hire them to carry our gear, but we never can participate in their personal lives.  Eric Valli, whatever his ulterior motives in creating this film (if any), had to have been driven by a love of the people and mountains to put this together.  In an era of globalization and the loss of cultures and languages every year, films of this kind have great anthropological and human geographical value.  It's too bad that more Eric Valli's don't exist to preserve our vanishing human heritage.  When presented as a story, it can reach a much wider audience than a standard documentary;  the story pulls the viewer into the lifestyle.
In addition to the movie, I found Debra Kellner's ""The Making of Himalaya"" to be equally as interesting.  It presents another side of these people as real people interacting with a director and film crew.  There is also an ""Electronic Press Kit"" which contains interesting footage such as showing cameras strapped on yaks' backs, and the pushing the fiberglass yak down the cliff into the lake.

The old village chief insists on waiting to take a yak caravan over the mountain on the specific date given by the oracles. A young whippersnapper, Karma, who would like to take over the Chief's role sooner rather than later, insists on leaving immediately before the weather turns foul. Both are stubborn, insistent and unmoving in their decision of when to leave. Both can't be correct or can they? This is a contest between each man and the mountain and everyone wins, because ""there are no accidents"".  A breathtaking film cinematically and one that echos the spirituality of the Tibetan people. Bruno Coulais' soundtrack for this film is absolutely perfect. Eric Valli's direction is amazing considering the cast are not actors. This movie will stay with you for a very long time.",1009411200,,853,4.835616438356165
1668169,5,B00005UQC7,"No special effects.
No romance.
No technology.
A simple story which reason to be is only so that you can discover the Himalayas.
And the Himalayas: a harsh life in a harsh country. I found the movie to be a masterpiece.",1008720000,6,219,4.365853658536586
1668199,5,B00005UQC7,"""Himalaya - l'enfance d'un chef"" is the crowning achievement of French anthropologist Eric Valli who for years has researched and documented the trade routes and yak caravans of the remote, isolated inner Dolpo region in north-central Nepal. This is NOT, as one reviewer has stated, a film about ""tibetan merchants harvesting salt"". The yak herders in ""Himalaya - l'enfance d'un chef"" are from Dolpo, where for centuries salt, which is abundant in Dolpo, has been traded for grain and black tea from the Tibetan high plateau, across the hazardous high passes leading to Tibet.
The central theme of the film is the rivalry between an old but experienced yak herder whose son was village chief but has just been killed while on caravan, and a young, inexperienced but very strong herder who believes the leadership role is his due.
The film captures masterfully the unforgiving harshness but breathtaking majesty of the mountains and the challenges of surviving in a rigorous environment.
But above all, one is taken inside a village and its people in inner Dolpo and provided with a vivid portrait of life in the high, remote Himalaya, a life full of hardship but also full of clarity, simplicity, and joy.
Himalayan Mahayana Bhuddism is an integral element here, represented by the dead chief's brother who is a monk. There are no references to Bon-po, the ancient religion that predates Bhuddism by several centuries and which is still practiced in Dolpo.
To be appreciated fully, ""Himalaya - l'enfance d'un chef"" should be seen on the big screen. It will lose a lot if ever converted to video.",1008288000,14,1595,4.955223880597015
1668200,5,B00005UQC7,"A very moving and thought provoking movie about the problems of succession in tribal leadership and the conflict of traditional religious/superstitious values versus a more pragmatic approach. The conflicts are resolved amicably but not without some tragedies. The scenery is breath taking and the acting is very convincing, clearly done by the local people. The production crew must have been almost as tough as the people they worked with!",998697600,7,441,5.405797101449275
1668201,4,B00005UQC7,"""Caravan"" was a nominee for Best Foreign Film at The 1999 Academy Awards, and it caused quite a stir due to it's then limited availability and pro Tibetan stance, ( Present day China wishes to capitalize on the merits of Tibetan society and include it in it's Republic ).  It is reissued theatrically in a limited run in 2001 under the new title, ""Himalaya"", an apparent attempt to bring attention to the spectacular Himalayan scenery that abounds in the film. The plot revolves around a seasonal migration by Tibetan trade merchants ( miners ) to harvest salt in The Himalayas. At first, the amateur cast is difficult to bare, over emphasized dialogue, a lot of fake grinning, but as the film progresses the short-ranged realism invoked by these Tibetan actors achieves a documentary-like quality which wouldn't have been reached had the cast been professionally trained. By reel's end, they find solid ground in the humbleness of their performances depicting the peacefulness of Tibetan culture. The drama builds to a deeply satisfying conclusion and the suspenseful mountain action sequences reminds us we don't need high-tech wizardry to make a mountain exciting. This is one beautiful picture.",998265600,15,1198,5.143589743589744

1668206,5,B00005UQC7,"I have just seen this film on video (non-pirated) in Japan. I found the film physically spot on in depicting life in Tibet.  I too have been fortunate to experience Tibet firsthand.  You might find more than a smattering of  baseball caps, sneakers, Michael Jordan T-shirts and, yes, Land Rovers up there these days, but in general, the magic  still exists.  Valli has beautifully represented this here. The bickering amongst the Tibetan characters is the only point I found out of place.  Even when angry, Tibetans don't seem so demonstrative.  Aside from that, and Kharma's atheism, I felt I was back up on the Tibetan Plateau watching this brilliant film.",993772800,3,658,4.927272727272728
1668207,5,B00005UQC7,"I saw this movie in a tiny theatre in Nepal, sitting on a hard wood bench - the first place it was ever released.  I was even fortunate enough to meet one of the actors from the film.  I had just driven through the Himalayas via Land Rover from Lhasa, Tibet to Kathmandu, Nepal and I was trying to come up with a way to describe to everyone back home how incredible Tibetan people are.  **This movie left me in awe.**  It not only captures the breathtaking landscapes but also, the beauty of these people whose culture and lifestyle are so foreign to Westerners.  I cannot wait to get my hands on a few copies because I will surely send it to everyone I know.  You MUST watch this film!!  Eric Valli is a god.  And the actors in the film deserve just as much credit - none of them were actual actors before they were cast in this movie.  I can't recommend it enough.",990662400,17,866,4.2

The accompanying documentary of ""the making of..."" fills in the amazing background to this project and is in itself worth the price of the disc.
