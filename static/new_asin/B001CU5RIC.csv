I wasn't sure what to expect, but seeing her story so raw, so real, so close to my own, just brought tears to my eyes.  After watching it all I could say was, ""I wish I had had an intervention"".  I still watch the show because it is real life and I know what it's like to struggle with addiction and mental illness day in and day out.  I am not recovered, but I'm trying.  Tamela's story made me want to get better.  I hope she knows that she's touched many lives through this special episode.  I wish her all the best because I know it is not an easy road.",1228262400,2,703,3.9361702127659575
