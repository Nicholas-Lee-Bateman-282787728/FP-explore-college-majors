4062264,5,B0032O8B3Y,This movie is for anyone wanting a basic understanding of the constant everyday reality of aboriginal disadvantage.  Whilst I have lived in Alice Springs for an extended period of time this movie allowed me to view the harsh world which I thankfully will only ever have to view from the outside.  I watched this movie over a year ago and it still ranks highly in my mind as a first class film.,1310688000,2,393,4.444444444444445
4062265,5,B0032O8B3Y,"I watched this film when we were flying back to the US Dec 2009. It was a very moving movie to watch and many times I found myself tearful. Having met some Aboriginals while in Alice Springs made the movie all that much more alive. It was interesting to see that the natives of Australia deal with some of the same issues the natives of American deal with, namely addiction. There were some obvious cultural issues presented as well as a young love story. It seems that love is love in any language, and sometimes when there is none! I would recommend this move to anyone but especially to young people or those preparing to travel to Australia!",1300492800,2,645,4.47457627118644
4062266,5,B0032O8B3Y,"Definitely not a ""feel good"" movie. That being said, it is well worth seeing. It will help one to understand a part of life that most of us aren't a bit familiar with. Beautifully acted & photographed. You may want to see it twice as it takes understanding of the story to get the most out of it.",1298419200,7,296,4.120689655172414
4062267,5,B0032O8B3Y,"My daughter and i happened to see this on Australian TV in Melbourne after she had completed a semester abroad in Townsville, Australia.  It was most timely for her, having had an aboriginal instructor.  I was so moved by this film, and feel it would be broadening for the American public to view a part of civilization of which we have little or no knowledge or concern.  We later saw a documentary on how Warwick Thornton found the actors(none of whom had previous experience) and exactly how the film fell into place.  i believe it only took about 6 weeks to film, had an extremely low budget, but with intense insight and sensibility.  Anyone interested in current social issues, travelers to Australia, really anyone with concern about the human condition around the globe should watch this.  Please make it available to view on American DVD players.

In addition to all this, the primary actors were invited to the Cannes 2009 festival... that says something as well.",1272067200,7,973,4.825301204819277
4062268,4,B0032O8B3Y,"A story of modern Australian outback where short of opportunities unprivileged kids are even much more short of everything if they are non-white, indigenous offspring but sexual abuse and drugs.

Was this opus funded by explaining the reasons for the ""intervention program""-a government-funded course of actions stripping the Northern Territory aboriginals of handing the cash payments and, in addition, placing adult cognitive people at mercy of ""financial managers"" deciding their living necessities?

It is a pitiful picture of post-Howard Australia still exemplifying round a globe concern for freedoms and liberties of far distant others.

It is a very special work and of interest to watch.",1266192000,5,696,5.609523809523809

8387606,1,B0032O8B3Y,I don't know how this could be an award winning film from Australia...A BORING WASTE OF TIME WATCHING AND WASTING MORE THAN AN HOUR MOVIE FOR ME...!!!,1482278400,,150,4.592592592592593
8387607,3,B0032O8B3Y,"Its more of a mime film, it was not what I thought I ordered but it was something to watch never the les . I thought it was based out the Bibl .",1453593600,,144,3.393939393939394
8387608,5,B0032O8B3Y,"A beautiful movie, left me thinking where our world is going. It is disturbing enough to see hungry animals in the wilderness because of loss of habitat, now we see beautiful people, who are not equipped with our knowledge and technology, being ignored right under our eyes. Sad and beautiful.",1441843200,,293,4.88
8387609,2,B0032O8B3Y,"Although this film won several awards, I found the subject matter problematic. Yes, in some Indigenous Australian communities there are various social problems, there are also other Indigenous Australian communities that are thriving. This film only shows one side of the coin and for that reason I would not recommend this film.",1421107200,,329,5.346153846153846
8387610,3,B0032O8B3Y,"Judging this film as a film unrelated to the Bible, it is ok. There is action, fighting, tension, love, betrayal, and beautiful people  even an elderly Diana Rigg (born 1938). There is also the battle of oppressors over the oppressed and some insertions of ancient history, such as the Philistines having steel swords while the Israelites only had bronze. I have seen several remakes of the Samson and Delilah story and they all have these qualities.
But the problem is that people see these films and think they are seeing what the Bible is stating. I remember a man telling me he knows all about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and Gods revelation of the Ten Commandments because he saw the movie. I saw a review of this Samson and Delilah film that said the same thing.  This is the problem. It isn't true.
While the film is loosely based on several chapters in the biblical book Judges, the story in the film is very unlike what the biblical writer wanted his readers to know. For example, a minor one, Delilah was not, as the film depicts a member of the Philistine royal family. Samson did not kill a lion to save her life. Samson did not wrestle the lion in front of Philistine soldiers; no one knew he killed the lion and this lack of knowledge is a key point in the biblical plot. Delilah was not the first Philistine woman Samson desired, but the third.
There is nothing wrong with inventing imaginative details that elaborate upon and even distort the biblical tale. Reading or seeing these elaborations can be fun. The ancient Jews did so in their Midrashim and Talmuds. But, as I wrote above, people need to realize that a film version is not what the Bible contains.",1417046400,,1688,4.567656765676568
8387611,4,B0032O8B3Y,"I saw this movie at the cinema originally. I had heard reviews and decided to see it was so sad - and so real. The performances of the main actors, although relatively unknowns in the acting field, were very good and I was transported back many years to a time when my 'bestie' was an aboriginal girl. Without giving away too much of the plot, I would recommend this without hesitation and indeed, that is why I bought the DVD.",1371945600,,427,4.35
8387612,5,B0032O8B3Y,"I would recommend this movie.  The acting is good and the setting is great.  As ususal, the product arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition",1364774400,,153,4.62962962962963
8387613,1,B0032O8B3Y,I had a hard time following this - I was hoping to find a love story that I could show in a group of teenagers - this was certainly not it.,1356566400,,139,3.5161290322580645
8387614,4,B0032O8B3Y,"Maybe I wasn't paying attention but when this was released I am sure it was described as a bitter sweet, coming of age romance. So let's be straight from the start. This is a powerful but sad story of love, attempted redemption and ultimate disintegration. Love does not conquer or save.  It gets taken apart in the ride. Bittersweet romantic comedy is is not. At the end of watching this my wife and I both felt scoured to the bone.  This is a film with courage. It asks you to face the issues portrayed front on without sentiment. But it leaves you grieving at the dysfunction portrayed, the mindless brutality casually exposed. Australia, but not the way we like to think of it, those of us that are living well. The story of these two, it is good to remind ourselves, is basically a story of children and who was there offering protection and keeping them safe. The cinematography is exceptional, the acting superb, but the story is acid running its course to what felt like an inevitable end.",1339718400,3,997,4.564245810055866
