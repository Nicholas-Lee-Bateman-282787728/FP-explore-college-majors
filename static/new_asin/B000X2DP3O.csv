2997742,5,B000X2DP3O,My kids can't get enough of both the DVD and the CD. They play the DVD almost every day and my four year old falls asleep to the music on the CD every night. We have already bought the DVD as a gift for our entire extended family. It's a winner!,1196035200,,245,3.823529411764706
2997743,5,B000X2DP3O,We love to expose our kids to all different cultures on video... this is our favorite along with the Baby Sambhota Tibetan kids videos... and there are other great culturally diverse videos available out there if you do not travel far with your kids!,1194048000,,250,4.704545454545454
2997744,5,B000X2DP3O,"My 1 year old son and I fell in love with the OyBaby dvd's and now Rob Wolf has made a new dvd with a wider audience in mind. All I can say is that my son and I love this one as much as the others! The music is great and is equally appealing to child and adult. I would highly recommend it to anyone and hope that another dvd will follow in a year or two. (My brother's children aged 13, 10 and 7 enjoyed it, too!)",1193270400,,414,3.662921348314607

8226740,5,B000X2DP3O,"I LOVE THIS DVD. Most children's movies/videos/music are/is annoying but this is really quite enjoyable and delightful especially for a small baby who needs something to chill out with. I know people are divided over media but I""m a single dad and I know there will be moments when I need to pop something in for my sanity... and it sure as hell won't be DORA.",1447286400,,360,4.46969696969697
8226741,5,B000X2DP3O,my kids love this.  I lost my copy of the DVD so I just bought it again for baby #3.,1332115200,,84,3.2
8226742,4,B000X2DP3O,"I bought this dvd/cd combo when my son was around 8 months old. He enjoyed watching the kids and graphics on the TV screen as well as listening to the music in the car. He's almost two now and still loves this dvd/cd. He calls it ""dance show"" and asks to watch it every morning before I take him to daycare. He's learning to say the alphabet and numbers that are featured on the dvd as well! Part of the dvd (like the puppets) might seem strange to adults, but kids really seem to love it! I enjoy most of the music myself.",1297641600,,523,4.087378640776699
8226743,2,B000X2DP3O,"I'm not a huge fan of the music on this, and my 11 month old son just wasn't interested. There are too many slow songs and it seems as if we are watching one family's home videos set to music they find sentimental. There is an attempt at being educational by showing the letters of the alphabet and some numbers, but otherwise, I'd say give it a miss. There isn't much racial diversity and the music is too slow to interest the very young. Try Baby Signing Time instead.",1284595200,,470,4.292134831460674
8226744,5,B000X2DP3O,"I have absolutely fallen in love with this DVD and wish there were more non-denominational DVD's created by this group! It is a DVD (and the CD too) that we all (my baby 6 months, my husband and myself) love and never get sick of... Our 6 month old watches the entire dvd without fussing and the CD calms him in the car on long drives... It is a great DVD with music that both parents and children can enjoy again and again!

P.S. My friends 3.5 year old daughter was over and watched it to the end with my son and was just as entranced by the music and images as my baby was. Great for all ages!",1280793600,,596,4.008403361344538
8226745,5,B000X2DP3O,"A friend gave us this video and it was one of the best gifts we have ever received for our daughter.  She got it when she was 1 and is now almost 2 and has never gotten sick if it.  We even brought it on cross-country flights with us and it was out last resort on a long flight when crankyness was over the top.  It calms her immidiatley when she isn't feeling well and adults like it too. It is a nice combination of real live kids, beautiful art in motion and great music with adult/kids crossover.  I plan to buy this for a few pregnant friends we love it so much.",1241740800,,567,3.9911504424778763
8226746,5,B000X2DP3O,"Finally a DVD that we all love - including my baby, my husband, and me.  The music is very pleasant, with great songs sung by great voices.  Acoustic guitar beats the typical baby chimes any day of the week in our house!  I've given the DVD as a gift at several baby showers, and it always gets rave reviews.",1213920000,,308,4.186440677966102
8226747,5,B000X2DP3O,That Baby DVD is a wonderful change to the kids DVD's out there.  Our family loves watching this dvd.,1201737600,2,101,4.315789473684211
8226748,5,B000X2DP3O,"I recommend this DVD to all my friends and they ALL not just love it, but are crazy for it!  The songs bring back memories, but also create new ones as I see my children entranced by the music.  The voice of the lead singer is soothing to us all, the music is phenomenal. Its the only CD we all never tire of (and that says a lot).  The DVD is mesmerizing to my kids, they adore it.  Rarely is there children's music that grown-ups can fall in love with, but this is just that!  This CD/DVD comes with my highest recommendation!",1201478400,2,528,4.137254901960785
8226749,5,B000X2DP3O,My kids and I both enjoy the DVD - it is a welcome change from the ususal toddler tunes!,1201478400,2,88,3.6842105263157894
