8270333,5,B000E1NXKE,My step-daughter loved the show 15 years ago and my 11 year old daughter loves it now!  She got the DVDs for her 11th bday and watches them over and over again.  She's memorized the scenes of a dance show and has every step down.  Timeless fun!,1172188800,,244,4.148936170212766
8270334,5,B000E1NXKE,"I watched the first 3 seasons on a long weekend and laughed SO MUCH remembering each character. This show is a clean show that I allow my kids to watch. It isn't about being  politically correct, Its just about a dad who realizes he needs help raising his 3 girls after his wife dies. He enlists the help of his brother in law and his best friend who add alot to the series and is probably why it continued for so many seasons. The later seasons were not as good as the first 4 because the girls started growing up and the show got into more questionable dialog. These first 3 seasons were just the innocense of 3 little girls growing up without a mom and with 3 loving guys to nurture and guide them.",1168473600,,701,4.192592592592592
