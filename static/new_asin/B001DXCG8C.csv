8295306,5,B001DXCG8C,I wish there were more DVDs. I really liked this one and how easy it was to follow. I haven't purchased her 30 day book yet because I keep hoping that another video will come out...,1458777600,,181,4.055555555555555
8295307,3,B001DXCG8C,"I would say this DVD is for the beginner dog parents, her book(30 days to a well mannered dog) covers much more details and deep understanding about dog's nature and how to coach them well. It's a great DVD, but I give three stars because of that reason.",1314662400,,254,4.3125
8295308,5,B001DXCG8C,A great follow up to the book.  Excellent to see how fast it can turn things around.,1274918400,,84,3.9411764705882355
8295309,5,B001DXCG8C,"Tamar de-bunks the myth that domination and force are a part of wolf-packs and therefore are acceptable ""training"" methods!  With sound backround in observing wild wolf packs, Tamar bases her guide on how wolf's REALLY teach eachother...through play!  You'll never have more fun with your dog, or feel more connected than after you start employing Tamar's methods.
Her writing style is easy to read, filled with real-life examples that leave you with the feeling you just read a memoir, versus a training manual.  However, the message sticks, and since it just makes sense, it's easy to remember (but if you forget, there's a cheat-sheet at the end of every chapter).
Readers of Tamar will also enjoy Victoria Stilwell and Karen Pryor.",1234656000,10,735,5.0578512396694215
