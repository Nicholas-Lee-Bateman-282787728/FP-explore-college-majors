I spent a lot of time searching for this movie, and so I was SO excited to find it here!

The DVD quality is very good, the movie itself totally holds up and it is really awesome to find a kid's movie that isn't scary (like Disney)!!

The child I bought this for loves it too---it's the movie most requested.  So, this is highly recommended!",1307059200,,438,4.117647058823529
