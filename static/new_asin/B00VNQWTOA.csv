7100294,5,B00VNQWTOA,"interesting story about this man, I was very engaged and sure didn't know anything before watching it.",1443398400,,102,5.0588235294117645
7100295,5,B00VNQWTOA,Great film but sad.,1437696000,,19,4.0
7100296,3,B00VNQWTOA,"Some very choppy and odd production going on in this one. There are talking heads who the viewer has no idea who they are. The story seems a bit loose. There are some nice racing scenes but the many situational reenactments are lame to say the least. Viewers also need to be warned that there is one very disturbing scene when talking about the dangers of descending, the lifeless bloody body of Fabian Casartelli is shown. These images had never been shown in the US that I had known or seen. Although the shot is less then five seconds it was disturbing  and indelible. I felt this was unnecessary and disrespectful.",1436659200,,618,4.5675675675675675
7100297,2,B00VNQWTOA,"Not a documentary but definitely a propaganda piece. Pantani was just another cycling doper. Yet this film tries to portray him as being the victim of a set up. ""Hey, that's my thing!"" says Lance Armstrong. Also, what the hell is accidental about a cocaine overdose?",1436140800,,266,4.804347826086956
7100298,2,B00VNQWTOA,"This was comprised mostly of racing clips until the very end.  Felt disjointed and choppy, not at all what I thought his life story would be like.  They seemed to be deliberately vague toward the end, not covering details of the belief that there was a conspiracy to de-throne him.  They danced around that topic as well as the details of his death alone in the hotel room.",1435795200,,373,4.455882352941177
7100299,5,B00VNQWTOA,Interesting documentary on a former world champion,1467072000,,50,6.285714285714286
7100300,5,B00VNQWTOA,Great Doc. tragic ending.,1466467200,,25,5.5
7100301,5,B00VNQWTOA,"Really superb depiction of a man who should have never taken his own life.  If he'd only lived a few more years he would have seen the entire "" take down"" of doping in cycling.  Very tragic and sad how his life became and his public turned their backs on him.  An amazing story and one of the most inspiring stories of comebacks in sports.  IL PIARATA, R.I.P.  You are a legend!",1466380800,,378,4.194444444444445
7100302,5,B00VNQWTOA,I was surprised that this film was so well done.  It offers an excellent inside view of professional cycling.,1465948800,,109,4.7368421052631575
7100303,3,B00VNQWTOA,"A bit misleading title. Pantani did not die from a bicycle racing accident , though he could have. Pantani participated in the drug enhancing culture that ultimately brought down the most famous of the American cyclists years later.",1465948800,,232,5.131578947368421
7100304,5,B00VNQWTOA,A tragic and touching story of one of cycling's greatest climbers.,1465948800,,66,5.090909090909091
7100305,3,B00VNQWTOA,Worthwhile-a sad ending,1465862400,,23,7.0
7100306,5,B00VNQWTOA,"Simply a great film, a view of Pantani told by the people who knew him, not Lance's version of Pantani.",1465776000,,103,4.2
7100307,3,B00VNQWTOA,He was a doper for years. This movie does not acknowledge that fact.,1465776000,,68,4.3076923076923075
7100308,5,B00VNQWTOA,"Pantani was always an interesting figure to me, all the more so as his career imploded and he ultimately succumbed to an early death. (The title reflects Erskine's position on the debate at the time of Pantani's death whether his drug overdose was accidental or intentional, although the topic is not expanded upon in the film.) But because his career coincided with Lance's and because the American press was furiously competing to cover Lance and ignore all others, there was precious little information available here on Pantani. This film does a stupendous job of filling the voids. From Marco's youth to his last days, every aspect is chronicled through interviews, film footage, still images, newspaper accounts, and more. The story is told honestly yet compassionately. Doubtless another writer could create a very different story from the same material, but Erskine chose his POV and stayed true to it throughout the film. This is an amazing piece of work and, in fact, I was so captivated I watched it twice in one evening. A compelling story about an intriguing character told with care, Pantani: The Accidental Death of a Cyclist is the example by which all other such biographies should be measured.",1465516800,5,1211,5.029850746268656
7100309,3,B00VNQWTOA,"Ok, started to fade at the end. The era right before Armstrong, PED or not these dudes are freaks of nature. A natural born climber we never got the chance to see a true dogfight between the two. We've seen this movie before and know how it ends. Senseless.",1465430400,,257,4.26530612244898
7100310,5,B00VNQWTOA,Great move about his life and challenges he faces on and off the bike.,1465430400,,70,4.071428571428571
7100311,5,B00VNQWTOA,"If you are a racing fan, you will love this.  If you remember the races he did, you will love this.  If you're looking for action and romance, you will be bored. This video paints a good picture of cycling culture as it was in the 2000's.",1465257600,,238,4.042553191489362
7100312,5,B00VNQWTOA,Lots of great details on doping in the sport. Sad story of a great rider in a sport at its lowest.,1465084800,,98,3.7142857142857144
7100313,5,B00VNQWTOA,Excellent documentary.,1464998400,,22,10.5

7100315,5,B00VNQWTOA,Every cyclist especially the ones that love to climb mountains should see this movie.,1464220800,,85,5.142857142857143
7100316,4,B00VNQWTOA,big picture of what goes on in cycling,1464048000,,38,3.875
7100317,5,B00VNQWTOA,"Compelling story, didn't know much about him until I saw this. Much more knowledgeable  personally on early 80's cycling so this was very fascinating to me to see how fierce pro cycling had become and his story was amazing and sad-highly recommend!",1463875200,,248,4.904761904761905
7100318,4,B00VNQWTOA,Captures the harrowing connection between the passion of Pantani and his somewhat unavoidable tragic end.,1461974400,,105,6.066666666666666
7100319,5,B00VNQWTOA,Loved it,1461715200,,8,3.5
7100320,5,B00VNQWTOA,I had never heard the whole story. I found it fascinating. Pantani was a great champion and rode in an era where EPO was in wide use. He was a champion of that era. Take away the EPO from all the competitors and he would still have been a champion (and perhaps would still be with us).,1461110400,,285,4.017543859649122
7100321,4,B00VNQWTOA,Interesting story behind the details of the unfortunate loss of this young man.  A victim of the system.,1461024000,,104,4.777777777777778
7100322,4,B00VNQWTOA,"Overall, a sad story about the realities of pro cycling.  Great footage of Marco destroying climbs.",1459123200,,99,5.1875
7100323,3,B00VNQWTOA,"A sympathetic but ultimately shallow recounting of the rise and fall of Marco Pantani. Pantani was a great talent caught up in the doping culture in professional cycling of the 1990s. Essentially all the champions of that era were doped and culpable for their actions, along with team owners, directors, doctors, and UCI. Some of the champions have had their reputations ruined, others are still revered despite being exposed as cheats. Pantani fell apart after being exposed and tragically died from a drug overdose. What made him unable to survive? Few answers from this film. The film is full of thrilling excerpts from Pantani's still unmatched double victories of the Giro d""Italia and the Tour de France and the inspiring story of his comeback from a devastating accident. The movies is worth watching for those alone.",1458000000,2,824,5.0661764705882355
7100324,5,B00VNQWTOA,Some great footage and background info. Very entertaining.,1458000000,,58,6.375
7100325,5,B00VNQWTOA,"Really tells the inner workings of that sport. It is not in the hands of the riders. One key quote ""I don't want to race anymore... why?... it is controlled by the mafia"".

Great movie and well done!",1458000000,,199,4.2368421052631575
7100326,5,B00VNQWTOA,"I've never followed cycling but was mesmerized by this documentary. Narratively exciting, beautifully crafted, and rich in portraying human tragedy, it is much larger than the particular story of Pantani and the institutions of big sports. Contrast the soul of Pantani we begin to see with the sense we get of Lance Armstrong in the equally compelling documentary Stop at Nothing.",1457913600,,380,5.245901639344262
7100327,5,B00VNQWTOA,Being a cyclist myself I understand the pit falls of pushing your self.  I would recommend this to all my friends.,1457568000,,114,4.428571428571429
7100328,5,B00VNQWTOA,I always knew this was a competitive sport.  What I didn't realize was the lengths countries and coaches would go to assure victory.  How very sad for Pantani and his family.  His mother was especially touching in this documentary.,1457222400,3,231,4.871794871794871
7100329,5,B00VNQWTOA,If you love cycling you'll love this movie. The life and tragic end to this great athletes life is well portrayed in this film.,1457049600,,127,4.333333333333333
7100330,5,B00VNQWTOA,"A well done and very very interesting documentary on one of the most troubled and talented bike racers of recents times. This is the kind of documentary you have to watch with an open mind and try and hold your judgement about doping and bike racing, and consider, instead, his great talent and circumstances under which he raced, and lived. Afterwards, you can hang out with your cycling friends after a long ride, and have an informed and lively conversation over a cold beverage. Discussions will be heated, opinions will be made, but in the end at least you will know a little more about Il Pirata.",1456876800,,602,4.635514018691588
7100331,3,B00VNQWTOA,Captures fairly well the life and downfall of the late cyclist.,1456876800,,63,4.818181818181818
7100332,5,B00VNQWTOA,Great documentary,1456012800,,17,8.0
7100333,5,B00VNQWTOA,"If you are a cycling fan of the past, great movie!!",1455580800,,51,3.727272727272727
7100334,4,B00VNQWTOA,"A very sad but true account of the cycling world and what it has perpetuated on it's athletes. All in the name of fame, fortune and grander. Like Lance Armstrong, Pantani was an amazing athlete in his own right and without drugs being injected into the sport would have still flourished. Yes, Athletes have a choice and yes they are all grown men who make a decision to either cheat or not cheat. The unfortunate part is why are they confronted with that decision in the first place? Sadly, this story is and was the precursor to the Lance Armstrong story. No matter who you choose to blame, this movie is a good account of the real pressures and reality cyclist are faced with when they turn pro and sometimes before they turn pro.",1455235200,3,732,4.470149253731344
7100335,5,B00VNQWTOA,Good,1454803200,,4,4.0
7100336,5,B00VNQWTOA,"Any fan of cycling need to watch this. Pantani was one of the greatest talent the sport has ever seen. The footages of him attacking up climbs back in the 90s against the likes of Indurain, Berzin, and Tonkov alone makes this a must watch. Seeing Casartelli on the ground is a vivid reminder about the dangers of this sport.",1454371200,,324,4.416666666666667
7100337,4,B00VNQWTOA,"As a cyclist I found this story fascinating and captivating, though it spent a very limited time on his truly tragic end.  Seems to me, it is a cautionary tale for other cyclists.  But on the scintillating side, i really liked the focus on this amazing climber and a champion with the Biggest Heart of the Tour!",1454025600,,311,4.43859649122807

8710726,5,B00VNQWTOA,Well done documentary on one of cycling's great riders.,1533427200,,55,5.222222222222222
8710727,5,B00VNQWTOA,Very moving documentary of a man that loved to race bicycles and how the pro sport at the time was pushing riders to dope. He was reluctant to dope and it bothered him. Not being able to ride pushed him over the edge. Well worth watching. Can see the difference between him and someone like Lance.,1532390400,,297,4.321428571428571
8710728,5,B00VNQWTOA,"A wonderfully done documentary that exceeds nearly anything I have ever seen. The description Prime gives about this documentary is patently wrong, as it assumes Pantani had an addiction problem, not a temporary means to quell the emotional pain by having his character and integrity challenged and called into question.  It avoids expounding on hemoglobin levels that are natrually cutivated (as in Hymalayian runners) perhaps with genetic propensity, that are NOT cultivated through EPO or other forms of doping. This story hit home for me as I came to cycling very similarly, and it was my passion from an early age.  This is a must see even for those not into cycling as the TRUE story goes, much, much deeper.  The cinematography and music is SO moving and compelling.  I don't want to give away the story or the full ending, but it punctuates the power of big money and evil forces in life and how they hurt or destroy anyone in their path. It also fortifies my belief and understanding that the truth doesn't matter if enough people believe the lies.  Lastly, it gives a hint (and in conjunction with other documentaries) just how dirty lace armstrong (no caps intentional) is.",1530057600,,1184,4.841584158415841
8710729,5,B00VNQWTOA,top film about the best cyclist.,1509667200,,32,4.5
8710730,5,B00VNQWTOA,"""On the climbs, the physical demands are immense.  Its the same competitive challenge kids in swimming pools do.  Holding their breath, who's going to give up first?  Who's going to asphyxiate themselves longest until you are almost at the point of blacking out?  And that's what climbing up a hill is like.  And thats what  Pantani could do more than anyone else.  Descend into the darkness - hold it there - and then come out alive. "" Best Quote From the movie.....",1505865600,2,467,4.621951219512195
8710731,5,B00VNQWTOA,"Super!  Very well done movie, and very interesting story!  My wife, who is not a cyclist, found it very interesting and was absorbed by it.  Highly recommended.",1477526400,,160,4.851851851851852
