2884173,4,B000SFJ3KU,"(3 1/2 *'s) George Clooney and Stephen Soderbergh have teamed up once again to produce `Wind Chill,' a horror movie that's more and less than one expects from a horror film.  First of all, it's equally a survivor story and a stalker/romance as well as ghost story with a colorful history.  Don't get me wrong, there are some scary moments in the movie, but the film admirably relies more on suspense and ambiguity in its presentation.  All of it comes together in a way that's as invigorating as a cold, arctic blast from Canada.

The movie starts with some familiar on-the-road setup, complete with the car that breaks down and everything goes wrong.  From there the developments are often different, however.  Mysterious without names, the ""Gal"" (Emily Blunt) foregoes the plane ride from college exams before holiday break and decides to take the Greyhound bus.  That is until she gets a text message during an exam inviting her to hook up with a ride from the posted message board.  She finds someone who's headed to Delaware, so on a lark she calls to make the connection.

The ""Guy"" (Ashton Holmes) seems wholly accommodating, except they both are in many ways a mismatch.  She finds him asleep at the wheel, waiting in the parking lot.  She doesn't have much room to put her stuff, but has less room to complain when she shows up late in the first place.  He shows a keen interest in her, even imposing on her cell phone calls and demanding her to engage in conversation as ""her part of the deal"".

Things aren't as they seem, and, ambiguity is a cornerstone to the movie's development.  It turns out that he knows a great deal more about her than she would expect, and his interest becomes more than practical, especially when he refuses to let her pay her share of the gas money.  When they come upon a remote gas station, gaunt, shadowy figures surround her.  She gets an unnerving sense that the journey is stacked against her, but not all the evidence adds up.  Is she a little paranoid and overly suspicious?  Is he chivalrous in an old-fashioned, but patronizing way, or is he a stalker?  When they leave the gas station, he abruptly turns out on remote Highway 606 much to her chagrin.  Soon they get into an argument, one that escalates as an oncoming car, forces them off the road in an accident that has alarming consequences looming before them.

Stranded they are left to encounter a barren area that contains a haunted past, one that fills their dream life until reality and supernatural start to blur.  More pressing is the need for the basics of survival as the radio announces the night will bring a 30 below wind chill, and they notice the gas tank is slowly leaking along with their prospects.  In the meantime, not only is the area haunted with a violent past, but the ""Guy"" has been keeping secrets from the ""Gal"" that slowly unfurl like a weather vein.

`Wind Chill' is as much of a drama and a mystery as it is a horror film.  Having seen the all-too-familiar developments of campfire horror films like 'Vacancy,' 'Wind Chill' is ahead of the front with a thoughtful, yet chilling development.",1189296000,30,3123,4.634545454545455
2884174,4,B000SFJ3KU,"You never know what to expect with these little, under-the-radar horror dvds.  On the rack, they all look the same, with pretty cover art that you suspect will end up having been the best part of the movie inside.  Luckily, WIND CHILL is a very pleasant surprise!  It's a very creepy, very well made suspense/horror film that ends as well as it begins.

Two students who meet through a ""Need a Ride?"" flyer on a college campus drive home together for Christmas break.  The weather is miserable, snowy and bleak.  The sky is grey, and the radio promises lots more snow for their long ride home.  A stupid short cut is attempted through an unplowed back road, and the two are forced off the road and into a snowbank by a mysterious vehicle coming the opposite way.

Trapped in the snowbank, unable to hike back to any sort of civilization, and without cellphones, food or warmth, they prepare to survive the night with temperatures dropping to 30 below zero.  And that's when they see their first shadowy figure.

I LOVE movies like this.  There isn't much if any gross out, just a creepy, and appropriately vague ghostly mystery to survive while trying to hold out against below freezing temperatures with a companion you're not sure you can trust.  The movie lost me at one point, during an overturned police car scene.  Things became too clear, too ""defeat the villain!"" for me for a moment, (you'll see when you get there) but the movie snaps right back into place, and ends beautifully, sadly, and with the creepiness intact.

I'd like to give this a 5 star rating, my wife and I enjoyed it so much.  But it isn't a perfect film, just a perfect way to spend an evening in your living room under a blanket!",1189123200,5,1708,4.554098360655738
2884175,5,B000SFJ3KU,"Why is the most promising films today seem to fall in the netherlands, never to be heard from again? Instead of something original, we have SAW 13 or BUZZKILL 4, or whatever the latest serial is these days. Thankfully, WIND CHILL is none of these. The two lead characters don't even have names--they're simply listed in the credits as Girl and Boy. But with Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes, names aren't really necessary.

The story starts out with Christmas break. Emily Blunt's character has broken up with her boyfriend and she needs a ride home to Delaware, that she finds via the student bullentin board. Ashton Holmes is so eager to please, that it is painful to watch. The typical geek totally in love with the unattainable teen goddess. And of course, Emily is being a total bitch on wheels.

Everything changes when an innocent wrong turn on a side road changes their lives forever. An out of control car runs them off the road into a ditch where they wait for someone to find them. The only problem is this area of highway is haunted, not by one, but by several ghosts. And not all of them are benign. Some are quite nasty and want to take as many with them as they can.

The look, the feel to the film is awesome. Even though it was a blistering heatwave outside, I was shivering as I watched this movie. The ghosts were so creepy,believably so. They didn't stop to explain anything, they were trapped in their own private hell and that made their haunting much more frightening for me.

So, I highly recommend WIND CHILL. It's a great horror flick, one that reminds me of another great classic, DEAD END--another haunted highway flick. Check them both out and stay on the main road!!",1189123200,4,1693,4.559210526315789
2884176,4,B000SFJ3KU,"You almost needed a magnifying glass to spot this one! I picked this one up because of the very talented Emily Blunt and the plot seemed downright frightening.

The film starts out with a mega bitchy Emily Blunt, her character is unnamed in the film, finishing her final exams and texting her friend with her holiday plans. It seems that she will have to take a bus to commute home and her friend tells her to go check the board at school to see if she can catch a ride with a fellow student. She finds a creepy guy going in her direction and they set off for Delaware!! But once in the car you can feel the tension between the two passengers. He wants to talk and she wants to block him out. He kind of gives it away that he doesn't even live in Delaware and this whole thing was just so that they could 'spend some alone time together'. By this time she is completely freaked and demands that he pull over but this is all brushed aside when a mystery car comes into the night and forces them off the road.

This wouldn't be a scary movie if it was a nice grassy plain they crashed into. No- they crash into a snow bank at night on the creepiest highway EVER. The film takes place in the course of a day- and that just makes it that much scarier. They have no heat and the driver has sustained some injuries thanks to their collision. But who can care about the 28 below temperature when ghosts are seen just walking up and down the street? It seems that this highway is haunted by more than just one ghost.

There is so much tension all throughout this movie and it adds to the suspense. Imagine being stuck in an old car in the dead of winter with terrifying creatures just coming in and out of focus. Although I do NOT believe in ghosts I found that for the most part the film was very believable. Emily Blunt shines as she becomes completely vulnerable by the end of the film. Ashton Holmes is good as well.

I watched this at night in the middle of summer and I had to get a blanket. The special features provided a more in depth look at the story behind the movie. This is not your typical gore fest horror- it is more of a suspenseful ghost story that takes place in a car in the middle of nowhere at night surrounded by snow. All in all I would have to say that I recommend this film to anyone who likes claustrophobic thrillers and creepy ghost stories.",1188950400,2,2363,4.1982378854625555
2884177,3,B000SFJ3KU,"Emily Blunt is a great actress, and it's a good thing since the acting is all this movie has going for it. The plot's nothing special; a guy and a girl (they don't have names?) find themselves being attacked by an evil spirit after their car gets stuck on a snowy road. Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for something shocking to happen, something to make this movie stand out from the rest. But it never came. This is just a typical ghost story, with better acting than most horror films. The character development between the guy and the girl is good, but it's for nothing since there's hardly a plot.

Wind Chill is actually better and more entertaining than most horror movies you'd find these days, but that's not saying a lot. Rent this for a creepy hour and a half; you most likely won't want to watch it again.",1188432000,9,825,4.427631578947368

They take a short cut and have an accident that leaves them stranded in the snow.

Here are the plus and minuses of Wind Chill:
+ Not one character has a name and in the credits are listed as Guy, Girl, etc....
-  Everything feels a bit dated and would have been a mainstream hit in 1997 instead of 2007.
+ Most of the movie takes place in a car. A nice extra for fans of similar plots.
-  Predictability. I was never surprised by what came next.
+ This could have been a Twilight Zone episode.
-  The reviews made it out to be way better than it was.

I don't normally have a problem figuring out an ending but with this one I was mildly surprised.  If you enjoy the  stories that make you believe this could really happen then this is for you.

I love a good suspense/horror movie and there are so few that are done well enough to be entertaining, believable AND scary.  This one was all that.  Enter a careless girl who makes last minute travel plans and decides to take a ride home for the holidays with a stranger.  I had a feeling there was more to what this guy was telling her, but I didn't get his role in things completely right.  I spent some time during the movie trying to figure out just what was going on, so in that regard, this one kept me guessing.

Once they become stranded, the real scares begin.  It's dark, it's cold and it's storming.  There is no one around for miles.  Or is there?

2884256,5,B000SFJ3KU,"Wind Chill is really awesome!  Usually I'm skeptical with horror movies nowadays because time and time again I'm disappointed in a lackluster, underachieving attempt at truly frightening horror, but Wind Chill gets it right.  It keeps the setting creepy and quiet with only two main characters, and it takes place in the eerily silent wilderness during an extremely cold winter night.  Two college students (Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes) do whatever it takes to survive not only the cold elements, but try to understand the mysterious ghosts wandering through the woods.  The emphasis is clearly on surviving the cold however.  The ghosts just make the ordeal more unbearable.

Though it doesn't seem like much in the way of creativity, it's actually a genius idea to show the ghosts as somewhat normal in the sense that they aren't very threatening at first.  For a good chunk of the film we only see ghosts walking slowly beside the wrecked car up a snowy hill while the two college teens find it mildly disturbing but aren't really anxious over it until later on when discoveries are made.  It's also wonderful how the setting centers around the car.  The two teens occasionally venture out a bit to explore the forest in search of help but quickly find themselves heading back to the car when the cold elements become too much to tolerate.  The cop parts are the best.  Whenever a cop appears it means something freaky is going to happen such as excessive cold air, ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" playing on the car radio or other things.  I'm just never sure if these cop segments are actually happening or if it's all a hallucination or dream.  In fact the entire second half seems to indicate it was all dream... at least I think.  There's several other touches of horror that work wonderfully throughout the movie you'll probably notice.

The movie seems to take elements of the Shining and uses mainly that movie as an influence for some of the spookier/uneasy moments, but of course Wind Chill is subdued in comparison.  Ashton Holmes and Emily Blunt both do a tremendous job building their characters.  At first they seem like forgettable/generic college students but after the car wreck and the realization that they need to look out for reach other to survive, both their characters become considerably better.  I do wish however that Emily wasn't so extremely uptight in the beginning, automatically assuming Ashton's character was going to attack or rape her all because he lied about being from Delaware.  I mean come on Emily!  You can loosen up a *little* bit and stop assuming the worst case scenario!

Otherwise yeah, Wind Chill does everything right.  Too bad there's no actual wind in the movie.  That little bit of wind near the end doesn't count either.  Take it from someone who lives in the northeast- that would have made the conditions MUCH colder!  There's a small twist at the end I didn't see coming, but I'm not entirely sure I understood it.

2884269,5,B000SFJ3KU,"I have read several reviews of this movie (1 - 3 star reviews). The one thing I think they have missed watching this film is that you can't compare it to the Saw movies or other slasher films or Rosemary's Baby or apocalyptic movies. I think in their rush to find a niche in which to put this movie, they forget there is one that doesn't need lots of CGI and blood and demons to be scary.

Wind Chill (inaptly named) is simply a good old fashioned ghost story full of supernatural happenings and claustrophobic scenes. I have seen it five times and there are still scenes I still jump from.

A pair of college kids, a beautiful but unreachable young woman (wonderfully played by Emily Blunt) and a sketchy, odd young man (played surprisingly well by Ashton Holmes) with an old questionable car end up pairing up to ride home from College for a vacation break. The creepiness begins here as the guy has packed a bunch of foods more likely for a romantic picnic than sustenance for a road trip. Unfortunately, one of them forgets to put the food back in the car as they leave the dorm parking lots.

We know the guy is up to no good from the beginning. The self-involved girl waited too long to plan her trip home and he was the only seemingly decent way she could find at the last minute that wasn't going to cost her a lot of money. They ride for a while and we get the sense that she is foolishly disconnected from the choices she has made. She puts on the music she likes, she makes phone calls thus ignoring the guy altogether. It is obvious this is not exactly what he had planned.

They finally hit the interstate in Pennsylvania headed home. The guy stops for gas at a slightly run down but serviceable station on the side of the road. This is where the story really begins. I also think it is here where a lot of people who watched this movie go off the tracks. I knew nothing about it when I watched it first time so I wasn't clouded with other people's opinions (which sometimes, especially in this movie, is a good thing).

The girl  leaves the car to buy snacks. When she gets back in the car, the guy has a map open. He decides to take a scenic side road that he claims will be faster. She argues but he's driving and she has no choice. Holmes plays this part of his role with a really subtle creepiness and we finally see the girl starting to get unnerved. It would be easy to go off the tracks here because not all is as it seems to be. If you are expecting a slasher film or horror movie made today, which generally entails CGI monsters, blood and Gore, and CGI ghosts, this is not it. They take the scenic road leaving civilization behind. As night falls it begins to snow and the chills begin.

From here on out this movie scared me more than any movie except White Out, another subtly done scary movie that has been unfairly treated by reviewers (imho). I don't know why I saw almost a completely different movie than others. After the snowstorm began, so did the scares. This movie is not perfect but as close to perfect as it gets for scares not generated by hacking knives or scary demons or comic book monsters we are steeped in today. In this ADD society we have come to expect the already mentioned forms of thrills and chills. This movie harkens back to the days when scares had to be almost implied because they didn't have the technology to do what is done today. That is what I loved about this movie. It was slow to build. Then we are immersed in a world of white in an old car and no cell phone signal in the middle of nowhere. And we don't know what lurks nearby but there is plenty of evidence something really scary is not far away.

If you can slow down, turn off all electronic devices and watch this movie from beginning to end with no interruptions and drop all expectations, I dare you NOT to be sufficiently scared by Wind Chill! Highly recommended.",1391299200,9,3888,4.309165526675787
2884270,1,B000SFJ3KU,"Is this movie supposed to be for kids? Not once during the whole movie was I scared. Is this supposed to be a horror movie? It looked more like a marriage drama. The whole time I was hoping for someone to get killed, because that's what usually happens in horror movies. I had to wait until the last 15 minutes of the movie for this to happen. And only one person got killed, what a disappointment. All the time I was rooting for college Guy to kill college Girl. She seemed like a crazy woman from hell. Without any reason she started to beat on him. Okay, he had some mental problems, but he hadn't hurt anyone. She was acting like a lunatic, and should be locked up. Or better, she should have been killed.

Emily Blunt's acting performance as the college Girl was dreadful, by the way. The college Guy also seemed to be suffering from autism or something, because at no time was he acting like a normal college Guy. He seemed like a mental patient escaped from an institution. No wonder college Girl got a little insane.

It is never explained why college Guy became a little unstable in the first place, but I guess that must be the reason. It only seems normal, any guy would do the same.

The fake snow was the only saving factor that stopped me from totally tearing this movie to pieces. It was a delight to watch and is truly fine fake snow. Unfortunately, snow can only do so much, and it saves the movie from being a total flop.",1388361600,,1439,4.322222222222222

It's more of an ambiguous ghost story. If you're in the mood for a slasher movie, this is not the film for you. If you can appreciate the dawning horror of realizing, stranded on a snowy highway in the middle of nowhere, that you are in far more peril than you thought, don't miss this film.

The acting, writing, and direction are all top notch. I loved the subtlety. It very gradually crept up on me, and I didn't realize how creeped out I was for quite a while.

2884282,3,B000SFJ3KU,"During the first 45 minutes of this film, mentally I was already preparing a five star review. During the next 25 minutes, I progressively amended it to a four stars one - and after suffering through the last 15 minutes, I mercilessly dropped one more star and I am not picking it up...

This film tells basically a very simple story of two college students who travel together on 23 December of an unknown year (somewhere after 2005). The Girl (Emily Blunt) needs to go to Delaware to be on time for Christmas. The Guy (Ashton Holmes) goes in that direction and agrees to take her with him in his old jalopy filled with junk (he is a philosophy student who just got kicked from his appartment...). The Girl is a clever, serious, no-nonsense young lady, majoring in engineering, not exactly very hot but certainly interesting in a ""smart is sexy"" kind of way. On another hand the Guy is a kind of insecure nerdy jerk and because of that there is not much joyful chattering during the voyage - instead there are some rather strange conversations and some pretty awkward silences... Finally the Girl starts to have a kind of bad feeling about the Guy, who seems to have his own agenda, of not exactly Christmasy nature, and the tension starts to rise...

Surprisingly, the first 45 minutes of film, during which finally not so much happens, are the best part of it. The uncomfortable atmosphere in the car and the rising tension between the Girl and the Guy are an unexpected treat, especially when things escalate into some verbal sniping on both sides. Both Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes gave a great show in this part of the film... When finally the crisis breaks, this film was going into the direction of minor masterpiece - but sadly, at this precise moment the director clearly started to lose control of the movie, exactly as if he was a driver of an old car driving at night on an icy road...

The events of next 25 minutes, of which I will not say more, are certainly rather dramatic, quite well filmed and they first follow a rather logical scenario, without any too visible plot holes. But quite fast things get extremely weird - too weird in my opinion. But still, even that part of the film was rather decent. I certainly feared at that moment greatly for those persons, who were in danger - and I thought that I would give four stars to the film as a whole...

Well, this was before the last 15 minutes started - and oh boy, was I surprised how badly this final part was! The director here tried to pile too much and as a result he overdid it... And I certainly completely hated the ending!

So all in all, it is a pretty decent film, in fact better than I really expected and I do not regret having watched it - but just be prepared for an unsatisfying finale and ending.",1349913600,10,2785,4.4636542239685655

Emily Blunt is particularly impressive as the cynical & control freak co-ed who just wants to get home with a stranger she begins to suspect is up to no good--but it's not the self-effacing male student who proves to be her worst nightmare.

The theme of Nietzche's ""Eternal Return"" pops up in the student's initial getting-to-know-you chit chat--and forshadows the terrifying events to come. This is more than a 20's-something angst. All the creative elements indicate a mature vision & production.

Not the easiest thing to accomplish when it's already the 23rd and your college is just now getting around to saying ""Class dismissed"". But what is this on the campus bulletin board? Someone looking for a driving companion to Delaware, where darling Emily needs to go? Ahhh, another Christmas miracle! Ok, so Ashton Holmes' ride isn't in the best of condition and space inside is limited due to him being in the process of moving, but beggars can't be choosers. However, Emily does begin to wonder if perhaps taking the Greyhound instead would have been a better option when her poverty row chauffeur begins to reveal how much he really knows about her and getting caught in telling lies. The road trip then turns from suspicious to flat out disasterous when an ill-fated desicion to take a less travelled ""scenic route"" culminates in a snowy dead end right off the road... by a vehicle from the opposite direction that left no tire tracks in the snow... Surely, when night falls for our stranded odd couple and the horrors of the road's past unearth, one may ponder if the Scenic 606 got the middle number wrong. The isolated winter atmosphere does pay off in dividends and the ""less is more"" approach to the supernatural storyline was the correct way to go. Yet, it's hard to pull for the two main characters when they possess rather unappealing personalities (though Emily's, ahem, attitude becomes justified after a while). Not as predictable as I thought it would be, but not as satisfying as I wanted it to be, either. 6/10",1292803200,3,1612,4.802158273381295

2884287,2,B000SFJ3KU,"This is a rather disappointing, and ultimately pretty incoherent, ghost story.  I think.

There are a number of holes in the script and direction, and not even the good acting can overcome these problems.

Strangely, given the lengths to which the production went to create the reality of the chilling winter in which our two protagonists are stranded in a road accident, the couple doesn't actually seem very cold.  In the ""making of"" featurette, they seemed to be shivering and showing their breath, but these effects weren't very visible in the movie itself.

Emily Blunt struggles gamely here, and even does one of the most credible American accents by a British actor that I've ever heard.

But ultimately the film really doesn't hold together very well, and you will likely wind up scratching your head and saying, ""huh?"" at the end.

Blunt deserves much better material, and I hope she finds more projects like ""The Young Victoria,"" in which she glows like a bright ember.",1283212800,,979,4.8969696969696965

The movie does lack on the horror side of the story, with not much originality. And the movie isn't really all that scary, but it's not trying to be, and I think them not trying so hard is why this move is so good. They rely on acting and character development, with a good romance development, and anything scary that happens is only a means to develope the relationship between these characters.

Expertly acted and directed, it would be a shame if you passed this small gem up for the reasons I almost did. And I can assure you that you would enjoy it even if you don't know, or care, who Emily Blunt is.",1280275200,5,841,4.217391304347826
2884289,4,B000SFJ3KU,"Clooney/Soderbergh's ""Wind Chill"" has been misjudged very harshly by most viewers--perhaps the problem lies with that first 15 minutes (character development, plot building) and the noticeable absence of people being set on fire, stabbed, led into porn/grindhouse brothels, etc.  These are the kinds of old tricks most ""horror fans"" expect these days.

What we have instead, fortunately, is a genuinely frightening exercise in a re-emerging horror technique that rarely fails to deliver: two young people (Emily Blunt as a very unappealing, rude, cold girl who undergoes a transformation a la Nietzsche through extreme physical duress) and Ashton Holmes (a bookish guy who, at the beginning, we imagine may be a little like Ted Bundy--the film plays with our perceptions very aptly) find themselves accidentally stuck on an obscure stretch of road near the college they attend. The director suggests that the babyfaced but extremely creepy Holmes may have done this on purpose, but it seems that it really was an accident, or a disturbing hand of occult fate which shoved them into a confrontation with a power too tortured to be alone for very long.

The wintry, cold feel and the imaginative detours which turn out not to be imagination at all but the supernatural answer to ""deja vu"" make the whole sequence of events deeply disturbing.  The ghost of a murderous sherrif from the past continues his quest via the psyche of these two young people who are freezing to death.  The scenes in the car with the two are really show how two people can connect, even under real suspicious circumstances, when the comforts of civilization are stripped away.  Emily Blunt makes it all totally believable.  Rather like an enhanced episode of ""Night Gallery"", this may represent a turning point in horror, and I hope it does.",1275350400,,1815,5.050167224080267

Blech. I usually can find something to like about almost any movie, and enjoy many ""so bad it's good"" kind of films. But Wind Chill stole two hours of my life and gave me less than nothing in return. It's not scary, it's not interesting, it has nothing to hold it together and it's like scores of other faceless ""horror"" movies we've all seen. It COULD have been a decent 15-20 minute short, possibly, but stretched out to feature length? The emperor has no clothes...also no plot and no chills.

2884291,5,B000SFJ3KU,"Wind Chill is a great little gem within the horror genre of the film industry.  This film may not be a conventional horror flick, but its usage of shocking scenes, twists, and mystery add enough suspense to the overall viewing experience that anyone looking for a good horror movie should check out.  The film is surrounded in mystery, and this adds greatly to the overall ""scare"" factor that it portrays.

The film begins by showing us the college campus of a young girl, played by Emily Blunt.  The girl is in the process of finishing her final exam before the campus closes for the winter in order to allow students to return home for the Christmas holiday.  Normally, the young woman uses a flight service to return to her hometown in Delaware, however, this year she decides to try to save money and use a different method of travel.  Her friend suggests that she uses the college's ""ride board"" in order to find someone willing to take her to Delaware.

After looking for a ride on the ""ride board"" at the university campus, the girl locates someone headed to Delaware for the Christmas holiday as well, and she decides to give the individual a call.  Upon their first meeting, the girl and the young man have a lot of tension between each other, and the long drive does not seem to be helping out the situation either.

Upon stopping midway through their drive, the two stop at a gas station in order to allow the young woman to utilize the restroom within the facility.  Things begin to take a turn for the worse, as the girl becomes trapped within the restroom, and no one outside is capable of hearing her shrieks for help.  Upon exiting and escaping the confinement of the room, she begins to suspect her driver has other intentions, and the feeling is passed onto the viewer as well.

As time progresses, the young girl become more suspicious of her driver's true intentions, especially after driving her off the main highway, onto a deserted road covered in ice and darkness.  After being run off the road by another vehicle, the two students are now stranded on the icy road, alone.  Once on this road, however, the two must help one another fight off the constant appearance of entities from the past who continue to harass the couple.  The ghosts appear constantly, and the moments building up to their appearance are very tense, and filled with a lot of suspense and ""chills"".

With the temperature getting lower, and the ghosts become more violent, the two students must fight off the violent spirits as well as the deadly temperatures.  The movie begins to show the true nature of the driver, as well as dig deeper into the past to reveal the true purpose of the ghosts.  With these surprises being revealed gradually, the film begins to unveil some of its mysterious nature that it is encompassed with.

The film is truly suspenseful and full of mystery, even to the point where neither main character is given a name.  Unraveling the true intentions of all the characters involved is great, and it truly adds to the overall depth and enjoyment of the film.  With a great setting, and well paced scares and thrills, the film is bound to keep you on your toes throughout its entire play-time.  The entire is unexpected, and makes the viewer rethink a lot of the events that occurred throughout the film.  Wind Chill is a film worth adding to your collection.",1273708800,,3377,4.638655462184874
2884292,4,B000SFJ3KU,"A trip home for Christmas through a desolate backwoods road ends in a disaster for two college students that are left stranded in the snow after surviving a horrible accident. As the pair soon finds out, the road has claimed many other victims in the past, victims whose ghostly remains continue to haunt the lonesome patch of highway. WIND CHILL is a beautifully shot and atmospheric ghost tale that uses cool blue filters, harsh weather conditions, and creepy shadow figures to create an overall unsettling mood. Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes draw the audience in with a strong initial build, but unfortunately their momentum is lost after the hour mark as the script loses focus and dissolves into a muddled mess. Before this, however, it does create sufficient thrills, suspense, and tension through Holmes' dubious intentions and the understated spirits haunting the forest. Gregory Jacobs delivers another case of style over substance that offers enough chills to earn itself at least a single viewing.

2884293,4,B000SFJ3KU,"Wind Chill is a lower budgeted horror film with a very simple plot - An unnamed college girl has to get home for Christmas, so she quickly finds an ad from a public campus bulletin board for someone who's willing to give a ride to Delaware, where she's from. The shy unnamed guy takes her on a chilly dim winter afternoon in a beat-up 4-door and after some good characterization and dialogue while driving and stopping in a greasy gas station for a pit stop, she discovers he's not really who he says he is and his intentions have more to do with weirdo nerdo puppy love than just a decent guy doing someone a favor. They crash in an off road in the middle of the woods and are snowed in due to the snow and freezing weather. They are left stranded and slowly find themselves being haunted by some mid-wood ghosts that they (kinda stupidly) discover died decades ago in the area and are being used as pawns by the ghosts from the past tragedy.

Originally I felt this was going to be another run of the mill cheese thriller, but what kept me watching was the star, Emily Blunt, who did a good job portraying the bitter and sarcastic tired college girl. Her and her attractive yet nerdy male co-star show good chemistry in their dialogue, which I shall say flows well and keeps things interesting. The cold and desolate cinematography and various spooky camera angles portraying these ghosts keeps you somewhat on your toes, not to also mention that the film uses a good amount of dark and almost blackened shots to really liven up the deserted atmosphere; add to this an impressive synthesized soundtrack. The story written with the ghosts is done pretty well, and though a couple of scenes are somewhat cheesy and add a couple of unexplained plot holes, they aren't a big deal and can be easily overlooked.
What makes this movie work is the growth of both characters - there is more dialogue in this than your typical horror flick of simply sex and screams. The two characters here are really all you get for almost 2 hours, therefore their chemistry was vital. And it does a good job and works. The build-up of their eventual friendship is real, and Emily Blunt is a breath of fresh air as she isn't just another screaming horror flick sexpot, but shows strength, realism and integrity. Her and her male co-star need to work together to get themselves out of the situation. It's great to see her trust in the guy build as the story progresses, and at first she sees him as some lying psycho with bad intentions, but soon discovers he's just a shy guy who took her through a loop but with gentle and sweet intentions. The transitions are gradual and more realistic than about 95% of modern straight-to-video horror flicks.
The ending also makes a good build-up, and though there are no eye-popping twists, it does satisfy for what the movie was a whole is.

For this cheap Amazon price, I would most definitely recommend picking this one up for a Friday or Saturday quiet date night.",1268697600,,2984,4.554934823091248
2884294,3,B000SFJ3KU,"***Contains Spoilers***

The reviews for this movie seem to be all over the place, depending on what people's tastes or expectations might be. Some liked the beginning of the movie, then lost interest when it veered down the road less traveled and became a supernatural tale. I personally was not in the mood for another stalker, slasher, torture story off the 5 o'clock news, so I was relieved when the guy didn't turn out to be a psycho stalker, and the hillbillies in the gas station/cafe weren't wrong turn sadists with a torture dungeon out back. You need to suspend disbelief to enjoy this since alot of things make little sense, such as being unable to get the car unstuck after going off the road even though it was still on basically flat ground, or thinking they could fix the leaking gas tank if only they had a blow torch. You kids playing along at home, NEVER try and fix a leaky gas tank with a torch. Just a free tip. There was also a scene where an eel came out of the mouth of one of the ghosts for whatever reason, and whenever they hit the cop ghost, they would rip through space-time or something and warp back into the front seat of the car. What? The last half of the movie felt like one of those urban legend campfire stories, or a Stephen King short story about dead man's curve, and while it was creepy in spots, it felt unfinished. There was even an attempt at romance, as the girl began to trust the guy.

Despite all of it's flaws, this isn't too bad compared to alot of what passes for horror these days as it relies more on suspense than bloody deaths and dismemberment. If you are looking for blood and gore, this movie isn't for you. If you just want a popcorn movie to watch with the lights out, you might get a couple chills. I have to dock this movie one star for the rushed and unsatisfactory ending that attempts to tug at the heartstrings as the girl sheds a tear and looks at the guys picture on her cell phone as the cornoner loads his body into the meat wagon. This movie tried to be a stalker, psychological thriller, ghost story, survival, romance movie all rolled into one, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts. It basically ends up most closely resembling an urban legend story with red herrings to make you think it might head another direction, and then gets cheapened by a sappy love story ending.",1259539200,,2356,4.376712328767123
2884295,5,B000SFJ3KU,"2007's ""Wind Chill"" is a mystery/horror film about a college gal (Emily Blunt) sharing a 6-hour ride with a male student (Ashton Holmes) home to Delaware. The guy is supposed to be a stranger but it turns out he knows more about her than anticipated. The story takes a tragic ghostly turn when they get stranded on Route 606 in the bitter evening cold.

I should point out right away that ""Wind Chill"" is inexplicably rated 'R'; there's really nothing in the film that should warrant such a rating -- there's no sex (although there's a bit o' romance), very little cussing (realistic, not overkill) and hardly any gore. If you want that see ""Cabin Fever"" or ""Friday the 13th."" ""Wind Chill"" shoots for something more profound, haunting and classy, like ""The Mothman Prophecies"".

The film is what I would call an ""isolated environment"" movie wherein the main characters are stuck in a confined situation for the better part of the picture, like in ""Prey"" where a woman and her two stepkids are stuck in a jeep fending off lions or ""The Mist"" where the characters are barricaded in a supermarket from the onslaught of otherworldly creatures. This scenario tended to work against those films as the confined setting became tedious (although ""The Mist"" redeems itself with one of the most unforgettable, awe-inspiring climaxes in film history) (and I still think ""Prey"" is worth catching for nature-runs-amok enthusiasts). By contrast, the confined setting somehow works in ""Wind Chill."" How so? I would chalk it up to great writing, acting and movie-making.

Think about it, there are essentially only two characters in this entire 91-minute film. For it to work it HAS to have stellar casting, writing and acting. It dawned on me while watching that ""Wind Chill"" is largely a dialogue-driven picture; the banter between the two protagonists pulled me in and sustained my interest, which isn't easy seeing as how ""isolated environment"" movies tend to try the viewer's patience & interest by their very nature.

Emily Blunt is easy on the eyes (what an understatement) but comes off a bit witchy and therefore unattractive initially, yet this plays into what the film is really about. Isn't this a mystery/horror flick? Yes, but the ghostly trappings are merely a stage for a tale of redemption. Unfortunately redemption always has a hefty price tag, not to mention love must fit into the mix somewhere. So, at its core, ""Wind Chill"" is a mystery chiller of love and redemption. Who it is that needs redeemed and why I'll leave to you to figure out, as well as who pays the price.

The score is awe-inspiring, in particular the piece at the beginning and end (and during the credits).

Although the story takes place in the East the film was shot in British Columbia. These are great locations, of course, but I'm starting to grow weary of the fact that 90% of these types of flicks are shot in B.C. Incidentally, the tale obviously occurs in Eastern Pennsylvania in light of a reference to Harrisburg on the radio and the I-476 highway sign (I-476 runs North-to-South from Scranton to Philadelphia).

I have a couple of cavils: When they're stranded on the country road it never looks nearly as cold as it's supposed to be, and is it believable that any college student, let alone a hot babe, would know about the junction box and phone jack on top of a telephone pole?

CONCLUSION: The average person who has a taste for this type of moody, spooky picture will conclude that ""Wind Chill"" is a classy chiller, what ushers it into the realm of greatness is its underlying profundities, stellar cast, writing, acting, music, locations and just all-around magical movie-making. For all these reasons ""Wind Chill"" is a pleasure to behold.

GRADE: A-

***ENDING SPOILER*** The climax, as told in Chapter 28, strikes a potent emotional chord as the girl stumbles out of the dark woods after a night of literal hell; she comes across the gas station, which links her to the authorities and salvation. Yet this is a much different woman than at the start of the picture; her life will never be the same as she is changed forever, changed for the good. She realizes this and can't hold back the tears. You can see it on her face; she understands the price that was paid for this new life. Emily Blunt pulls the scene off expertly; in fact, everything about the finale is filmmaking of the finest expertise. Magnificent.",1259280000,,4407,4.794466403162056

2884299,4,B000SFJ3KU,"When Christmas break rolls around a young woman (Emily Blunt) waits to the last minute to find a ride. A suggestion to her cell phone makes her take a look at the local kiosk where she finds a share a ride notice for someone heading her way.

She meets up with the young man offering the ride (Ashton Holmes) and they head out on the road, forgetting several packages in the parking lot that would have come in useful later. Along the way the girl (that's how she's listed in the credits) offers a totally unsocial atmosphere to her benefactor.

During their conversations things begin to look a bit unusual. Subtle clues point out that this young man may not be who he claims. His knowledge of where she comes from and where he is heading is lacking. His interest in her seems a bit overdone. And eventually his attempts to impress her result in them crashing the car in a snow bank in one of the worst storms that year.

Stranded in the snow and lacking any food items (told you those bags left in the parking lot would have come in handy) they do their best to survive. The road he chose as a short cut turned out to be one sparsely traveled at best. The only car seen for some time was the one that ran them off the road.

Cold and hungry, he sets out to find help at the gas station several miles back down the road. While he is gone, the girl begins to see things. People who aren't there, And one who is, a man wrapped in wire and struggling to walk. When she gets back to the car the young man returns and neither can find any evidence of the man she saw.

The films plays on the desolate location and the sights and sounds the pair see or perhaps don't see. Are the images before them real or imagined? Or perhaps they are the ghosts of lives past who have also traveled the road.

One set is a group of what appears to be monks. Upon investigation the young man finds a burned out house that still holds the remains of several men in their bunks. But the most startling image is that of a state patrolman who seems more intent on doing harm than helping.

When the young man is injured, it's up to the woman to save them. Taking a phone and hoping to connect on the pole that stands along in the white wonderland, she climbs with the intent of seeking help. She does so but even this person is not safe from the patrolman.

But again we are left to wonder, as he appears and disappears, is he real or not? The clues are there for all to see and you might even have the chance of putting them together to figure out the whole story. But before it happens, you'll be jolted back and forth from calm to fear, from safe to danger, in a story that chills not just because of location but because of the forces behind it as well.

The acting is quite well for such a small film. It relies completely on the two leads to carry off not only the difficulties between them but the dependence on one another as well. Is he a stalker? Did he crash on purpose? And how are the people they see connected to what's going on?

If you're in need of a good chill (perhaps not this winter but while in front of the fireplace of heater) then this movie is worth looking for. It offers a better scare that is more in mind than out and keeps you guessing.",1236124800,,3243,4.1744

The whole time I was hoping for someone to get killed, because that's what usually happens in horror movies. I had to wait until the last 15 minutes of the movie for this to happen. And only one person got killed, what a disappointment. All the time I was rooting for college Guy to kill college Girl. She seemed like a crazy woman from hell. Without any reason she started to beat on him. Okay, he had some mental problems, but he hadn't hurt anyone. She was acting like a lunatic, and should be locked up. Or better, she should have been killed.

Emily Blunt's acting performance as the college Girl was dreadful, by the way. The college Guy also seemed to be suffering from autism or something, because at no time was he acting like a normal college Guy. He seemed like a mental patient escaped from an institution. No wonder college Girl got a little insane.

It is never explained why college Guy became a little unstable in the first place, but I guess that must be the reason. It only seems normal, any guy would do the same.

A self-centered engineering student (wonderfully portrayed by Emily Blunt of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" fame) foolishly accepts a ride home from a lonely classmate (Ashton Holmes).

My only complaint (hence only four stars instead of five) was that some of the 'ghosts' or whatever they were, were a bit OTT, especially the one with the eel or whatever it was meant to be, when things like that start happening, I lose a bit of interest because it just seems so silly, and unnecessary, as, so often in movies what is hinted at, or only half seen, is far more effective than straight-up, in-your-face silliness, and at one point in the midst of some of the dreams, hallucinations, happening from the past, or time warp memory or whatever, I found myself growing a little bored, whereas throughout the rest of the movie, I was riveted, especially the bit where Emily Blunt's character goes out alone into the raging blizzard to climb a telegraph pole in the middle of the night with the threat of phantoms appearing at any moment. That, combined with the wild elements of the weather and the dark coniferous trees was a superb touch and my favourite moment in the whole movie. A very effective scene indeed.
The two characters worked well together and were believable and, as they grew closer, their plight, coupled with their growing closeness, was very touching and ulitmately very sad, given the outcome.
A joy to watch and I wish they made more movies like this one.",1213920000,3,1622,4.635416666666667
2884309,5,B000SFJ3KU,"Ah, yes, the old ""who needs a ride?"" trick to spend some quality time with a hot coed - why didn't I think of that when I was in college?  You get your chance to wow and impress the girl, and she gets the ride home she needs without having to worry about riding a bus - everyone's happy, right?  Not in this case - and that's putting it mildly.  It makes for one terrific movie, though.  I know some people won't embrace this story, but I loved it.  Sure, it has a few rough edges, but it's a surprisingly intelligent, atmospheric, gripping little gem of a film.  And, while it's more of a psychological thriller than a horror film per se, Wind Chill has its creepy moments.  I don't know if I was just off my guard or tired or what, but this thing even elicited a small cry of surprise from my throat at one point - and that almost never, ever happens.

The best thing about Wind Chill - well, actually the best thing about it is Emily Blunt - but the next best thing is the film's ability to move in different directions at just the right time.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, the story squirts right out of your arms like a greased pig.  This makes the film a little more convoluted than some viewers might like, resulting in some confusion - despite the fact that I believe it spoon feeds you almost too much in the end.  We're so used to the almost complete lack of creative ideas coming out Hollywood that your first instinct is to compare what you are seeing with other movies.  The filmmakers in this case actually use that to the film's advantage, however.  When you're wondering whether this is another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B00005JMDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hitcher-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000NO3DLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hitcher (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeepers-Creepers/dp/B00005RHGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeepers Creepers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hills-Have-Eyes/dp/B000E8M0P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hills Have Eyes</a>, etc., you're wonderfully vulnerable to this film's different transitions - and, in the end, I think Wind Chill manages to carve a nice little cozy niche for itself.

The main characters are not given names, so I'll be referring to them as Girl and Guy.  Girl (Emily Blunt) is planning to take a bus home to Delaware over Christmas break, then follows up on someone's suggestion to check the message boards for a possible ride.  That's how she ends up riding home with Guy (Ashton Holmes), and it is not an easy trip.  For starters, she treats him rather shabbily, as she's in full ice queen mode; she can hardly be bothered to even talk to him.  She also senses, right from the start, that something just isn't right about Guy; her sense of foreboding only increases when she learns that Guy knows things about her that he really shouldn't know.  When Guy decides to suddenly leave the highway in favor of a ""shortcut"" in the form of a snow-covered country road, she reaches her breaking point and starts demanding answers from this fellow she now sees as a threat.  Then everything changes in a heartbeat, as an accident leaves the pair stranded by the side of the exceedingly lonely road.  The intensity of the film slowly builds to a feverish pitch from this point on.  I won't go into any of the details, but it is clear that very strange doings are going on in the woods beside the road.

I was happily surprised by the level of intensity this film managed to generate and retain throughout.  I really had no idea how the story would play out in the end until the film's final moments, and for that I have to give the director, writers,  and actors all kinds of credit.  Wind Chill simply refuses to ever let you get comfortable in your role as a viewer, and that makes it quite a rare commodity in today's horror market.  It's also the only film I can think of that utilizes the philosophy of Nietzsche as an integral part of the story.  This is truly one of those ""we need more like this"" horror films.",1209859200,3,4266,5.125722543352601

Everyone has gotten their car stuck in the snow once in their lives and there are some basic steps to getting it free.

Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes play two nameless college students who share a ride home for the holidays.  On the way from Pennsylvania to Delaware, their car becomes stranded in a snow bank far away from civilization.  Soon they are being haunted by the ghosts of all the numerous people who died earlier in the very spot that seems intent on claiming two fresh victims.

""Wind Chill"" is a modest little horror outing whose admirable restraint and sense of atmosphere don't quite compensate for its overall lack of energy and incoherent storyline.  It takes quite awhile for the plot to kick itself into gear, and even when it does, the movie ends not with a bang but with a whimper.

""Wind Chill"" is certainly preferable to an out-and-out gore-fest like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel,"" but a few more runs through the typewriter (or word processor, as the case may be) might have gone a long way towards making it a more satisfying and scary film.  Like the car stuck in the snowdrift, the audience at ""Wind Chill"" ultimately finds itself stranded in the middle of nowhere.",1204675200,5,1068,4.709677419354839

Emily Blunt (Meryl Streep's assistant in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>) is a college girl needing a ride home for winter break. Ashton Holmes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-History-of-Violence/dp/B000CQLZ0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A History of Violence</a>) is the guy offering to give her a lift. Evening is approaching and after getting some directions at a rest stop, the two venture onto a lonely snow covered road that's supposed to be a shortcut back to the main highway. They soon get run off the road by an oncoming car and get stuck in a snow drift. To make matters worse, it starts to snow and some decisions have to be made about what to do.

This lays the foundation of a great little story written by Joe Gangemi and Steven Katz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-of-the-Vampire/dp/B000092T3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow of the Vampire</a>). It's a little bit claustrophobic with a lot of time being spent in the car and out of the elements. The two don't really know each that well, so there's a lot of focus on dialog as the guy and the girl (there's never any names mentioned) try to figure each other out. So we're a little uneasy with them, a little uneasy with the situation, and a little uneasy with some creepy people who walk by occasionally.

There's a nice slowly paced build-up in the story. The visuals are great. It's a snowy night with only ambient light, so everything is in shades of blue with lots of shadows everywhere. Gregory Jacobs does a fine job directing his second movie (the first was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Criminal/dp/B0007R4SZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Criminal</a>) after being an assistant director for many of George Clooney's movies--who, by the way, teams up with Steven Soderbergh as Executive Producers on this venture.

If you're easily bored if there's not enough action to advance a story, this flick probably isn't for you. On the other hand, if you're willing to overlook a few minor flaws, there's plenty of ghostly atmosphere to immerse yourself in for a very enjoyable 90 minutes.",1202860800,3,2532,5.816711590296496

I will not get into the details because first of all, there are enough people here, who surprisingly to me, enjoyed the film and has explained the plot well enough, and also because I was honestly nodding in and out of this film. I can't remember the last time a film has made me fall asleep, but it's been awhile.

Basically what made me nod off was the so- so acting (neither impressive nor downright lousy), the supposedly shocking scares were incredibly dull, and the story itself turned out to be nothing new from what many other films have done in the past. And above all the chemistry between Blunt and whoever the man was was non existant. They together made the film very awkward that's all.

Never would watch again and do not recommend it.

2884328,4,B000SFJ3KU,"Boy, am I glad I didn't allow some negative reviews to put me off this movie! Wind Chill is one of those rare contemporary horror movies that is devoid of explicit sex, gore and excess violence, yet manages to convey a sense of suspense and menace.

Emily Blunt [of Devil Wears Prada fame] plays the main character of a college student who needs a ride back to Delaware for Christmas break. She gets a ride from a guy from school whom she doesn't know [Ashton Holmes] and both settle into an awkward, even abrasive companionship during the ride. Then, a short cut on a desolate stretch of road worsens things for the both of them as they find themselves at the mercy of inclement weather and other strange forces.

The suspense in this movie is credibly built up - Emily Blunt's character slowly begins to question the motives of the guy she is riding with, and Ashton Holmes' character plays a sort of hapless, smitten character that just wants to please the lovely companion he is with. But is he genuine or possessed of more sinister motives?The acting of the two leads are credible, though it is Emily Blunt's suspicious, determined role that deserves special mention.

Then of course, just as secrets are being revealed, we are introduced to the other 'stars' of the movie - hulking black shapes moving through the surrounding woods, strange shuffling figures, and so on. Will the stranded couple find help in time or are they to become victims of some malicious evil? Wind Chill manages to effectively build up tension and suspense in telling a story that though not purely original, is nevertheless sufficiently credible and chilling.

If you like horror movies that are high on atmosphere and character-driven, then this comes highly recommended.",1191542400,6,1754,4.836666666666667
2884329,5,B000SFJ3KU,"The premise of ""Wind Chill"" is this: a pair of travellers on their way home from college for Christmas vacation become stormstayed along an isolated section of little-used road, winding through the thick of a large forest.  There, gradually, ghosts of those who've died on the same road begin to manifest their prescence.

  From this simple (although cool) basic plot emerges one of the scariest, best, most real-feeling, and most memorable movies of the year.  It engages from start to finish, succeeds at being surprisingly multi-layered, and Should have been the sleeper hit of the summer.

  The travellers, played by Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes, are characters we know virtually nothing about when the car ride begins just minutes into the movie.  The particulars about the characters start unfolding long before they run into any trouble on the road; and well before any supernatural elements enter the picture, an intriguing and suspenseful movie is already in full swing.  Blunt and Holmes play off each other with tremendous talent and effect.  Prior to the first apparition, the pair already finds themselves off course and increasingly lost, with daylight waning fast.  A road accident sends their vehicle into a snowbank on one of the coldest nights of the year, with a storm rapidly rising, and then the eerier elements start to slowly drift into play.  The night I watched this wasn't cold, but I found myself feeling a definate freeze deeper in the movie - seldom has any film been so effective at transporting one into the time and place of the story.  As for what emerges beyond the initial appearances of the ghosts, it's probably best to leave some of it unhinted at, and preserve the mysterious atmosphere ""Wind Chill"" possesses.  I may be making the movie sound a bit slower than it is; although it's true that it doesn't move at breakneck speed all the way through, there's not a dull moment or the slightest hint of 'filler' to be found.  Imminently watchable from the first frame to the last.

  If there was any justice, then come 'awards season' this would be remembered and considered for a host of honors.  As it is, though, I think that this is the kind of movie that will slowly but steadily find fans as the years go by.  For some, it may feel that the horror elements take a bit too long to come into full force, but I think a lot of people will appreciate the pace it takes and the opportunity it gives itself to explore a couple of other angles.  Highest possible recomendation for fans of everything from ""Dark Water"" to ""Identity"" to ""Silent Hill"".",1191110400,4,2587,4.766292134831461

A few other things that kind of tested the limits of belief I would put up with (even in a ghost story) sort of lowered my opinion of this movie.  It was supposed to be 30 below zero outside.  That's cold, and the characters were acting cold, but not 30 degree below zero cold.  And when it's 30 below zero can you really keep the bright headlights on all night without the car running? What kind of a battery did that guy have in that thing? And how many girls have you gone out with who not only know how to tap into a telephone junction box on top of a telephone pole, but who would be able to climb the thing and tap into the box in 30 below zero weather?

2884334,5,B000SFJ3KU,"Honestly, I thought this movie was fantastic. I have been excited to see this since I read about it in Fangoria a few months back. The only other film I had seen Emily Blunt in was Devil Wears Prada, which was not my cup of tea, but she was best part of that film. And there aren't a lot of people that 'do' creepy as good as Martin Donovan's cop; and he does not dissapoint in this either. Emily's co-star, Ashton Holmes, from History of Violence, was perfect as the shy, slightly stalkerish 'guy'. The non- use of character names for Blunt and Holmes' characters just adds to the erieness (?) of this film. However, the story is so friggin good that you don't notice these two don't have names! And the fact that these two are, for the most part, the only two faces on the screen for 90% of the film, is a statement to their acting ability that they can hold the audience. I felt kind of sad as I read some of the other reviews of this film, as I relaized that no one gets scared, or better, creeped out anymore by something as simple as a blurred figure walking by a wrecked car, with a girl inside, in the middle of a snowbank. Think about it, you're alone in a car that just crashed, on a desolate road mind you, into a snowbank. The driver leaves to find help, leaving you to attempt to tape up the gap in the window. Your breath has fogged the windows to the point that you cannot clearly see outside. There isn't a soul insight. Or so you think. Suddenly there is movement outside the window. You can't see who it is; assume it's your friend...except this figure keeps shuffling by the car...oblivious to it and the person inside. It's pitch black, snow is falling and you need help. What do you do? Obviously you have to see this scene to really get the idea of what these characters went through. But it was creepy as hell. I think, unfortunatly, that we have all become so desensitized (sp?) to blood and gore that when we see a horror film we expect bloodshed. And when we don't get it, then the movie is no good. think Phantoms with Affleck, McGowan and O'Toole. A phenomenal movie! Unreal sounds (C'mon, when has Patsy Cline's ""I Fall to Pieces"" given you chills, in a scary way?) and visuals etc...A town, completely void of humans, when only hours before it was a normal, operating town. Well, Wind Chill has a very similar feeling to Phantoms. It's just plain creepy and spooky. No, there isn't bloodshed, or chainsaws ripping through people, and mind you, I love those movies as well, but this does it with atmosphere, pure and simple. Please give this movie a chance. Don't go in with expectations other than ""I wanna be scared and creeped out."" If you expect Hostel or F13, you will be disappointed. And remember, The Changeling, The Others, and Ghost Story were horror movies too. Each without (or close to it) a drop of blood hitting the screen. They all did it with story, atmosphere and acting. And so does Wind Chill.",1189555200,32,2942,4.4099264705882355
2884335,5,B000SFJ3KU,"This movie was limited theatrical release so I never got the chance to see it on the big screen, but I anxiously awaited the dvd release and I must say for me it was well worth the wait.  The actors did a good job; the acting wasn't overdone or cheesy like alot of horror flicks nowadays... very natural... they just did what was necessary to convey the mood. I fell in love with [the two main characters] by the end, and what I really loved about them was watching the evolution of their interpersonal dynamic. Again, nothing there was overdone; it seemed pretty natural that they'd evolve the way they did. As for the plot of the film, I feel WIND CHILL did a pretty good job of tying all the little details together (i.e. foreshawdowing etc.), keeping you in suspense, and keeping the viewer captivated ...by the end everything seemed to fall into place in terms of the plot, the characters, and their purpose for existing in this film.. Really impressed overall. Good Supernatural tale. I'd recommend to any thriller lover!",1189382400,6,1027,4.642857142857143
2884336,2,B000SFJ3KU,"What starts out as a great story gets sidetracked literally and figuratively after about 30 minutes.  That's when all logic is thrown out the window and the ""ghosts"" start showing up and the rest of the movie tries to explain what's going on.  Do we care?  Not really, although it must be said Emily Blunt rises above the mundane screenplay with a performance worthy of a better film.  She is a star in the making.  The screenwriters need to experience real life and not merely reel life -- all their references are bits and pieces from better movies.",1189296000,5,551,4.581632653061225
8205185,2,B000SFJ3KU,I can't believe all the five-star reviews. They mention some philosophical concept and that makes it original? It takes more than that to make the motorists-stranded-in-the-middle-of-nowhere trope interesting. A waste of time.,1526860800,,226,6.09375
8205186,3,B000SFJ3KU,"Beautiful cinematography and production design -- the film feels utterly cold, lonely, and terrifying. However, if the only reason you keep watching is because you can't wait to see the nasty, entitled, bored, and otherwise completely unsympathetic protagonist suffer a slow, painful, lonesome death, then change the channel now.",1526774400,,329,5.73469387755102

8205189,4,B000SFJ3KU,"Good -- great acting, atmospheric, even has poignant music.  The central conceit wouldn't work today, 2018.  What college student would hitch a ride with a complete stranger?  Why didn't she get the hell outta there when he started acting funny?  Even after the plot turns into a ghost story, they crash, and they start to also freeze, and are probably gonna die, Boy never apologizes for putting Girl into that position.  Both are stupid about dealing with being stranded in the cold.  At least walk to the top of a hill to get a cell signal!  Or insist on both hiking back to that store, and break IN if it's closed!  Even if you hate the Boy, Girl, you gotta cuddle up for body heat.  Etc etc.  You do end up rooting for them both though.  ""The Boy"" does eventually  end up far more sympathetic as a character, even tragic, mostly because the actor is so terrific.  All that said, it's worth the watch.",1523059200,,905,4.445121951219512
8205190,4,B000SFJ3KU,I really enjoyed this movie. It was super creepy and had me on the edge of my seat during a lot of moments.  I was somewhat confused in the beginning because I didn't know what was going on especially when she started seeing those people in the snow just walking around and then it would repeat.  After a while I started to get it.  It was sad when the guy she was with passed away but in the end even while he was dead he still managed to save her which was sweet but seriously sad.  I liked when he was saying that he would have told her everything eventually and that it would have been that sweet funny story they had to look back on.  I just wish they both would have survived and been able to look back on that day as an adventure even though it was a scary one.  At least they found each other during that trying time.  Very good movie and worth watching for sure.  It was interesting.  There was drama and the creep factor as well.  It was a scary thriller that left you guessing and biting your nails.,1522886400,,1010,4.107142857142857
8205191,1,B000SFJ3KU,"When I take an immediate dislike to the protagonists of a film from literally the first few seconds they appear on screen, I know it's gonna be an uphill battle to get through the rest of the movie.  The Girl character--and, by the way, what's with not giving them names?  It added nothing to the film and only stood out as an awkward omission--but anyway, Girl was sullen, rude and totally self-centered from the get-go.  I mean really, who just chucks out a bag of groceries from another person's car just so you can fit your own stuff in? Hello!--did she never think of the BACK SEAT! So, I basically hated Girl right off the bat.

Boy was creepy, spineless and weird, so I didn't like him either.

When we arrived at the meat of the story, they both tended to exhibit that basic level of scattered cluelessness that even an instinct for survival seems not to clear away.  I mean, try a little harder to get the car unstuck, for cryin' out loud!  Failing that, immediately get your ass in gear and start hoofing it back to the main road, for pete's sake!  At least try to get to some higher ground to possibly get a cell signal!  When people in a crisis situation neglect to attempt even the most overtly logical actions for their deliverance, then I can't but feel they deserve to die.  Darwinism and all that. I mean really?--you need scissors to cut duct tape!?  Hopeless.

I did not find this movie scary, or atmospheric, or even coherent for that matter (why did Girl get locked in the bathroom? why did snakes come out of some zombies mouths? why did tow truck Guy turn into ice? why were the climbing spikes placed so low on the telephone pole?). I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this piece of mediocrity.",1520121600,,1717,4.43312101910828
