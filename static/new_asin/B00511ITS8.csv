8452165,3,B00511ITS8,"Very over the top humor. More like a sketch comedy--the acting, the angel/devil who appear out of nowhere in Haruna's bedroom, the cheesy background music, the spontaneous singing and dancing characters. I think some people will like this style, but I had a hard time relating to Haruna because of it. I feel like the manga, while hilarious, also touched me emotionally, and I'm not sure this movie did. There were funny parts though. Also, Yoh is really well cast. Disclaimer: I am a Japanese language learner, and there are no subtitles on this DVD, so I probably missed out on a lot. Also, this is a region 2 DVD, so make sure your DVD player supports that.",1453680000,,660,4.601694915254237
