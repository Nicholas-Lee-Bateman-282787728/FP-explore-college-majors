1959849,5,B0000YEEUS,It is a great movie. I saw it before and have been looking for the movie for a long time.,1359158400,,89,3.5
1959850,2,B0000YEEUS,"The buddy-pairing of Judge Reinhold and Willem Dafoe is a curious one. Reinhold somehow built a career on Billy from Beverly Hills Cop and a guest spot as the ""close talker"" on Seinfeld, while Dafoe earned well-deserved fame from films such as Last Temptation of Christ and Platoon, though his best work may actually be 2002's Auto Focus. You could say that pairing them together is movie magic, but you would be wrong.

In fact, the movie is a complete bomb. Lead female Kaaren Lee can't act her way out of a wet paper bag, there's no real laughs nor any credible drama, and no one is helped by the piss-poor direction from first-timer John Mark Robinson. This movie blows chunks of chicken-fried steak.

Rating:
One star for being shot on location (Arizona's Route 66), the other for Willem actually singing on stage. That's a very generous 2-star rating, folks.",1355011200,2,1105,5.610778443113772
1959851,5,B0000YEEUS,"This is a review of the product, not the movie itself. The product arrived new and factory sealed as advertised. I haven't watched the movie yet. I started to watch this on TV but it was getting late and I had to go to bed. It was interesting enough that I decided to buy the movie.",1337126400,,282,4.053571428571429
1959852,3,B0000YEEUS,"Roadhouse 66, 1984 film

This is a low-budget action movie with a story set in the southwest. A young man is driving a two-seat 1955 Thunderbird along a less-traveled highway. A 1955 Chevy Bel-Air runs up along side and threatens him. A gunshot creates a leak in the T-bird's radiator. [This is set in the 1960s.] The T-bird driver picks up a hitchhiker and takes him along to a small town. [Johnny has a past that will be revealed later.] There is a problem in getting a radiator for the T-bird. Johnny helps out. [There is a contrast between a college-educated man and one with much practical knowledge, and the humor from this.] The characters of these individuals are shown by their speech.

The bad guys in the 1955 Chevy arrive in town. There is a game of 8-ball (a symbolic battle). MBA-man and Johnny decide to race the T-bird in the annual ""66"" race on Route 66 which is limited to cars produced before 1966. The race has the usual action and conflicts needed for a movie that appeals to the 15 to 24 age group. There is also a fire from arson the death of an old man. There is a love interest between the men and the local auto parts store owner and her sister. The good guys win in the end after surviving their ordeal (the rule for these morality plays). Those who play by the rules wind up as the winners. This is a typical low-budget movie that is neither very good or very bad. Some younger people are tested by life, and succeed and survive. Those with flaws find their reward. [Note the absence of real families and society in this small town.]

Route 66 was built to go from Chicago (the big city in the Mid-West) down south to Oklahoma and Texas and west to Los Angeles. The Interstate Highway Construction of the early 1920s built it and the Lincoln Highway (from New York to San Francisco, the two big financial cities on the oceans). The coming depression ended funding in 1927, there was no more until the 1950s when even more highways were built across the country until the 1970s. Travel by highways reduced and ended travel by railroads (the cost effective way to haul freight and passengers from one big city to another). Air travel also reduced railroad travel. The end result was to create a dependency on Big Oil, a fault that would soon be revealed in 1973 (in part to Nixon's devalued currency).

These highways were great until the escalating prices for imported oil revealed the unpleasant flaw in this system. Are we really better off in transportation than a century ago? In many way yes. But the increased necessity of travel is not one of them. What can be done? Only more regulation of oil corporations and oil imports can free us from this addiction. Oil companies have closed down refineries to create a shortage of gasoline and escalating prices. Traveling to work and shopping have become dependent on automobile travel. The power of big oil has destroyed the small businesses that used to be just a few blocks away from your home (as before the 1960s). Most people who experienced life from WW I have joined the Silent Majority and cannot s speak about those times. You can learn about life then by watching ""The Best Years of Their Lives"" (even though it is a Hollywood story).",1335398400,,3222,4.55
1959853,5,B0000YEEUS,"Yes, the movie was far from Oscar material, but I'm buying it because as a kid living smack between the Sant&eacute; Fe Rail way and Highway 66 in Kingman Arizona,  it was a pretty big deal when my dad rented out a section of his salvage yard to the film company, and it was an even bigger deal when I was charged with running the forklift back and forth, to stack cars at the direction of the ""Art Director"".  Yup, if you see a big pile of junk cars and a junk yard shed, my parents mobile home was actually about 100 feet to the west of there, and I moved all the cars onto a ""set"" where I played as a child.  I remember William Defoe and Judge Reinhold seeming like pretty regular guys actually; that and there was any amazing quantity of what I thought was really awesome food.  And Yes, I agree, that's no reason for you to buy it, as the movie kind of bites otherwise.",1320969600,4,874,4.123529411764705
1959854,3,B0000YEEUS,I saw this movie when first released on Video years ago and didn't mind it back than so after talking to a friend who is a car fan buys American Muscle cars and Mustangs reminded me so bought a copy of Road House 66 filmed 4/3 luckily my Blu Ray player can be adjusted so the film can be viewed on full screen & as for the sound wasn't the best but not bad than again it was made in 1984 with Willem Dafoe & Judge Reinhold and great classic cars .,1270598400,,447,3.869565217391304
1959855,1,B0000YEEUS,"Willem Dafoe took the money and ran.

Terrible script.  Really bad.  Absolutely nothing original.

The only thing that explains Dafoe being in this boring movie is $$$$.

I give it one star for the brief female nudity.",1265932800,,218,4.783783783783784
1959856,4,B0000YEEUS,"After getting his radiator shot at by three local toughs, Beckman(Judge Reinhold) and hitchhiker Johnny(Willem Dafoe) find themselves stranded in a small Arizona town over Labor Day weekend. Soon, they meet Jessie, who owns the auto parts store,(played by Kaaren Lee) and her just home from college sister, Melissa, (Kate Vernon). After getting the radiator fixed, they spend time hanging in the local tavern (The 66), where they meet up again with the trouble-making trio. Hostility  builds between the two sides, as does attractions between Beckman and Melissa, and Johnny and Jessie. Beckman, who is driving a 1955 Thunderbird, decides to enter the local Labor Day race (Open only to cars built before 1966), pitting him directly against the three (or so it would seem). Great drama and action follow as does excellent rockabilly music provided by a powerful and driving soundtrack. Just a fun and very entertaining movie.",998006400,8,925,5.208053691275167
