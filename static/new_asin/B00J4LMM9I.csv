6333338,1,B00J4LMM9I,This movie sucked! The acting was awful and the cinematography was appalling. Diifferent seasoned actors and actresses may have changed the quality; but this was an epic fail!!!,1403049600,,177,5.357142857142857

8648091,4,B00J4LMM9I,"Why so many negative reviews? I had not seen the reviews before watching this, and really only checked here to see if anyone could explain the final scene. Overall, the movie kept my interest, and I enjoyed the major plot twist. I went back through some of the film to see if I should have picked up on it earlier - and there were a couple of lines that actually do tip off what is really going on (but there is also one big ""cheat"" that makes the big reveal a bit less believable). I agree the acting was not great, but I'm not sure that some of this was not intentional. I'm not going to say more, so as not to spoil the surprise, but if you like sci-fi films, you could do a lot worse...",1410307200,2,690,4.043795620437956

8648096,1,B00J4LMM9I,"The movie's premise sounded cool, but that's where the coolness ends.

This movie is pretty terrible. Why? Let me count the ways:

1. The dialog is unnatural.
2. The acting is wooden/inappropriate/at-times-bizarre.
3. The character responses to situations are inappropriate/impossible-to-believe.
4. The cinematography is... well, let's just say move along because there's nothing to see here, People.

Despite the bad reviews, I thought I might kick back and enjoy a decent B movie on a long weekend. Instead, I ended up kicking myself for choosing this truly awful flick.",1404518400,2,573,5.415730337078652
