8061869,2,B0009JE5MG,"Citizen Kane it ain't, but for what it is, it's pretty well done. It's shot entirely on a soundstage, but it's not a bad jungle set, and there is a little stock footage cut in here and there. The storyline is improbable and hokey, but that's what makes these programmers fun to watch. The German pilot is despicably devious and arrogant, the American pilot is unwaveringly gallant and noble, and the girl has the vocabulary and diction of a NY debutante despite being raised in isolation on a desert isle. Don't know why the writers made the enemy pilot a member of the Luftwaffe instead of the Japanese AF, but what the heck.  By far the best thing in the movie is Inez Cooper who is great eye candy and a pretty good singer. If you like 1930s-40s Hollywood movie serials, you'll probably like this, because that's the feel it's got.",1309305600,,834,4.52317880794702

8061871,1,B0009JE5MG,"The premise is of a WWI veteran with his beautiful naive daughter (Inez Cooper) protecting a secret (oil) on an island in the South Pacific, along with some 'Hollywood' natives who look about as authentic as those on ""Gilligan's Island"" and that is being generous.  An American and a GERMAN pilot engage in a dogfight and both crash on the island.  The German pilot is so stiff and stereotyped, it's terrible - plus he is far too tall to even be a pilot... and his plane isn't even a German warplane - it was obviously American surplus.  His 3rd Reich speech about taking over the Pacific islands is so laughable - GERMANS in the PACIFIC?

The dogfight scene lasts a whole two minutes and looks as if two kids had models on a string in slow motion... and in some close-up cockpit shots, the fighter plane on the rear screen projection is actually BIGGER than the plane in the foreground!  There are some laughable  fistfight scenes, also, to go along with the terrible dialog.  There is a scene later in the movie with a Japanese transport plane the German radioed in that lands on the island as it MOWS over PALM TREES!  Its wings actually cut them down for a landing strip!  The ONLY saving grace of this film is the eye candy of Inez Cooper - so very sexy.  The finale with the Japanese soldiers (from the transport), the allied inhabitants and the island natives which is reminiscent of a bad Cowboys and Indians film is a flat-out joke.

There are very few 'wings' in this film - the majority of this film is on LAND, all set on a Hollywood soundstaged island that even Gilligan would have been ashamed of with such poor rear screen backdrops and lighting - in fact, it's some of the worst film lighting I've ever seen.  Sad to think that our troops in combat most likely viewed this film as it was released in 1943, during WWII - had to be embarrassing, I'm sure.  It's a great laugh for a buck, though and again, the eye candy is not bad for its time.",1183420800,3,1958,4.405555555555556
