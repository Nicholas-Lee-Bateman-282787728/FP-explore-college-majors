522148,5,6302800579,"I've always called this movite that...I went to see it in the theater when I was 5, and I fell in love with it. I'm a horse lover since birth, and I knew I wanted to do something with horses, but it was not until I saw this move that I found out what. I started taking classes and became an equestrian, I have my own ""sylvester"", and like for Charlie, he's my dream come true and one of the loves of my life. I'm 22 now and even 17 years after watching the movie for the first time, the footage of the cross country and the moolight training still make me want to cry. A great movie, specially for ""all those little girls in love with horses"" like myself. A good family movie too, I still find myself joking with my dad that he never thought that by taking me to the movies that afternoon that he was going to be spending so much on me and my horse some years after.",1017964800,23,866,4.011560693641618

522193,5,6302800579,"I had to speak out in defense of this movie: In regards to the viewers criticizing the rating and the content of this film--I get what you're saying, but this film handles some difficult subject matter in a way that's very true to life, and perhaps the film could be used as an opportunity for discussion as opposed to simply being banned from viewing by kids? I was a kid when I first watched this movie. I loved it. I rented it from the video store at least once per month. As an adult, I was ecstatic to find it on DVD. Melissa Gilbert's ""Charlie"" is the ultimate underdog--she's trying to raise her two little brothers on her own; she's bullied at work by a male co-worker, and she's found a horse who (like her) doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the cow pokes. What makes this film more than the average horse movie is the depth of Charlie's character and the fact that the film is willing to tackle quite a bit more subject matter than just the typical mindless  ""girl and her horse"" story.  If I could give the movie more than 5 stars, I would!",1473638400,3,1055,4.27

I started watching this with my girls thinking it would be inspiring to them but ended up turning it off after the first 45 min. This is not an appropriate movie for children.

Everyone did a great job, the acting was terrific, the story had real depth and the horse was a beauty.  Everyone in the movie has growth and changes they went through as the young rider pursued her dreams with such tenacity.

522324,5,6302800579,"My children and I began watching this movie when they were young and into Three Day Eventing. It might be the only classic movie in which the sport of Eventing takes center stage. My kids watched it so often, they know it by heart! A few nights ago, I watched it with an adult woman, new to Eventing, and we had a great time discussing the staging, the corniness and predictability of the movie. Yet the horse scenes are unforgettable, at least for those of us who just happen to love horses!
This is not a little kids movie. There is vulgarity, sexuality, and one scene of sexual violence. It is pretty tame by teenage standards. Family  values are strongly reinforced, along with responsibility and hard work.
I love this movie. Should have bought it, not rented it!",1434412800,,768,4.565217391304348

522451,5,6302800579,"""Sylvester"" is one of my favorite horse films of all time. It has it all; amazing actors, nice soundtrack, majestic horses and stunning landscapes. This film, with the cussing, brutal horse training methods, a rape scene and other adult elements make this a more ""adult"" take of a horse-crazy girl reaching her equestrian-centric goals. With all the odds against her, it's encouraging to see Charlie still trying to reach her dreams.
There is also more to this film than just horses, though, which makes me feel safe enough to recommend this to even those who don't care much for horses. This film also deals with family and boyfriend relationships. With all the maturing and developing I've seen, and with everyone starting to accept Charlie;'s dreams in their own way just seems to complete this film.
The whole movie just fills me with a warm, fuzzy feeling of nostalgia.
Plus, on a lesser note, this stars Melessa Gilbert, who plays Lura Ingles from ""Little House on the Prairie"". Can't go wrong with that, can you?",1407369600,,1019,4.862068965517241

522538,3,6302800579,Rated R in 1985 -- language and nudity and mature themes.  Don't know how it's being published as a PG rating now.  Good shots of the dressage and jumping.  Adequate acting.

There was almost nonstop swearing, an attempted rape scene, and frontal nudity during the rape scene. It was at this point we turned it off.

We were looking for a nice horse themed movie and this was not it. This was a gift that immediately went into the trash. If you are looking for a family-themed movie, pass this one by.",1324944000,6,479,4.206521739130435

522553,2,6302800579,"My daughter loves horses.  I couldn't tell you how many horse movies I've bought or rented for her.  I had high-hopes for Sylvester because of the English riding and competition theme.  Unfortunately, Sylvester suffers from three basic problems.

Near the beginning of the movie there is an unexpected rape attempt which makes for uncomfortable viewing with children.  I could have done completely without the scene, and having to explain to my daughter why that girl was fighting with a man while he tried to take her shirt off in her truck.

The second problem is the acting.  It's poor.

In order for a movie to be good, any movie, it has to suspend your disbelief.  Sylvester does not.  It's one unbelievable and/or unrealistic thing after another.

The only saving grace for the movie is the very cool riding scenes during the competition at the end of the movie.  So use scene-select to skip over the scene in her pickup truck to keep it young-horse-lover appropriate and roll your eyes at the silly drama scenes.",1314921600,5,1019,4.793103448275862

522556,2,6302800579,"I bought this movie for my 2 horse loving daughters.  While the story line is a good classic horse story- wild rodeo type horse becomes 3 day event champion, the rest of it is terrible.  The language is horrible and should not be rated PG.  Also there is a pretty graphic scene where one the stable hands tries to rape Charlie ( Melissa Gilbert).  I am guessing that PG rating were different when this movie was made in the 80's, but I have never seen a PG movie quite like this.  If you are looking for a wholesome family horse story, this is NOT your movie. I will be reselling this one.",1304121600,18,589,4.223214285714286

522592,3,6302800579,"I doubt I have anything to say about this movie that hasn't been said already, so I'll keep this short.

I caught this on TV a while back and, equine junkie that I am, I enjoyed it.  It *is* a little soapy and a little pie-in-the-sky, but if you come from an eventing background (or just enjoy watching eventers), you won't notice.  You'll be too busy drooling over the beautiful footage of The Gray Goose (the horse who played Sylvester) and his fellows strutting their stuff.  It's a great movie to watch when you can't ride because it's been raining for two weeks straight and even the indoor ring is flooded, you're on vacation away from the barn, or you have the flu -- any time you need a nice, horsey pick-me-up.

And did I mention the horse footage?  Yes?  Okay, I'm sure you get the picture.

Note to parents of young children: this movie does deal with some pretty mature themes.  If you're thinking about showing it to your kids, you'll want to watch it yourself, first.  I would say it's probably intended more for a teens-and-up audience.",1247184000,,1051,4.5132275132275135

522594,5,6302800579,"What an astonishing movie this was and I am glad I taped it off the television. To get it on DVD will be much better, though. I have enjoyed Richard Farnsworth in a Kenny Rogers movie called Wild Horses, and in The Straight Story. He was also on an episode of Highway to Heaven. I watched Charlie take care of her younger brothers, fighting with CPS to keep her family together, then fighting with Mr. Foster to let her and her brothers move in with him. Watching her ride Sylvester topped everything, though, especially that sailing jump over the pickup that encouraged her to train him for, of all things, a championship three-day event. As improbable as it is for a first-timer to win, this is a movie, not a documentary. I enjoyed watching the man lead the contestants over the cross-country course so they would know what they were facing. Another moment earlier on I look forward to is watching Charlie try on the jodphurs and being told she had better wear white undies. So much she had to learn, such as how to salute to begin her dressage routine, and that it was an event, not a horse show. A terrific movie showing the viewers that, with support and encouragement, and your own determination, you just might end up a winner.",1235347200,,1235,4.542600896860987

It follows Charlie(Melissa Gilbert), a girl who trains a cow horse to go to the 3-day Event in Kentuky. Lots of great riding scenes, both western and english, a side love story between Charlie and Matt, played by the same actor as Jake Ryan in 16 candles, Michael Schoeffling.

Along with the main story, there is family drama as Charlie (Melissa Gilbert) struggles to keep her family together and balance out her love-life.  For the most part, this flick would be suitable for all audiences but there is a rather graphic attempted rape near the beginning and a fight later on in the movie.

522615,3,6302800579,"This is one of those infuriating movies: most of it is splendid--five stars (the parts involving the horse and the girl who learns to ride).  The rest stinks--one star (the ""love"" story).

There's nothing wrong with putting a love story into a movie like this.  It could have made the movie better.  But you don't put in any love story into any script in which one of the characters is repulsive.  Any script consultant could have told the producer that.  (And every screenwriter of any worth should know it.)  The screenwriter did everything she could think of to make this guy obnoxious and she succeeded.  Is she serious?  Would you advise any friend of yours to marry a creep like this?  I kept thinking that it was going to be alright because she was eventually going to tell him to take a hike, so when--with no understable motivation--she gave herself to him sexually, it was revolting (and I like a good love scene).  If we believed such an outrageous turn of events, we would have to say that this girl has serious psychological problems (even though there is no other evidence of such problems).  In the end, we can only hope that she wises up during her coming year and finds a man worthy of her.

And we can hope that other producers and screenwriters learn from this huge mistake and write only love stories in which both characters are lovable.",1129161600,8,1358,4.5850622406639

522618,4,6302800579,"Melissa Gilbert made her movie debut in this National Velvet-styled story of a determined girl and her jumping horse. Gilbert is a tough on the outside / soft on the inside teenage orphan who trains a worthless cowpony, transforming him into a classy 3-Day Eventer. With the help of her drunken mentor (Richard Farnsworth, the penultimate cowboy) they train the ghostly gray horse by moonlight, and dazzle everyone by daylight when the horse and his rider make it to the top show ranks. There are lots of sudsy subplots, but it just adds to the fun. I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and my horsy friends and I all saw it more than once. Not quite a classic, Sylvester is still a great one for horse lovers and definitely worth a spot in your DVD library.

I did become an eventer and did get to compete at the Horse Park thought it was not Rolex, which is an unrealistic expectation of this movie.  All in all it's one of my favorite horse flicks and will always be one despite the cheesiness of it.  The chemistry between Gilbert and Farnsworh is great, however it seems forced with the boyfriend.  After becoming a rider I found what happened in this movie could really never happen in real life.
