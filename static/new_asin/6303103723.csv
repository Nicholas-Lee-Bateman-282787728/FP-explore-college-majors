569081,4,6303103723,"I only take off a point because the color and sound are not quite as good as I would have hoped for a mid-'60s film and it's a tad overlong at 1 hr 55 min.
 Otherwise, a very entertaining story (NOT a copy of Robin Hood, despite my allusion) combining humor, romance, and some tragedy, well-acted. Claudia Cardinale has never looked or sounded better and is convincing in her role to boot.",1044835200,3,389,4.402777777777778

7838709,5,6303103723,"""Cartouche"" (1961) is Phillipe de Broca's other hit film several years earlier that he also did ""That Man From Rio"" (1964) both starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and both written by Daniel Boulanger with de Broca, ""That Man From Rio"" also with J.P. Rappeneau and Ariane Mnouchkine, albeit the better script making a better film.  The great Charles Spaak also helped write ""Cartouche.""  The music is also by Geroges Delerue but the sumptuous photography of ""Cartouche"" is by Christian Matras.  Opposite Belmondo for ""Cartouche"" is Claudia Cardinale, Odile Versois, Marcel Dalio, Jess Hahn, Jean Rochefort and many others in this time a swashbuckling story of an 18th century master thief, swordsman and rogue who becomes a kind of Frenchmen's Robin Hood and together with a beautiful bandit question if true love may be more dangerous.  Fast-paced, never boring and often hilarious, the film is visually arresting.  The film ends on a sobering note.  The Anchor Bay DVD edition is a widescreen presentation enhanced for 16 x 9 TVs with both English and French languages with optional English subtitles in beautiful Eastmancolor and Dolby Digital Mono.  No extras.",1395187200,5,1156,5.216216216216216
7838710,1,6303103723,"It is 80 percent comedy and 20 percent action movie. Even the action scenes look humorous not serious. There are some scenes that make me laugh. However, most of the time, the movie is boring and dragging.
The characters just keep on talking and talking and talking. It is absolutely predictable.",1386374400,,296,4.823529411764706

7838712,1,6303103723,"This film is a complete failure. Expectations are set high not only by the overall reputation of French as great masters of comedy, but by the admirable cast as well (Belmondo, Cardinale, Rochefort).  However sloppy directorship, shallow script, dumb jokes, primitive ideas and lazy acting result in utter disappointment. Could only last watching first 10 minutes of the film.",1278720000,2,376,5.372881355932203
7838713,5,6303103723,"In CARTOUCHE you made the rest of the 60s filmmakers seem out of date, and in Belmondo and Cardinale you found the perfect actors who could add the bubbles to your brand of filmic champagne. Now that you are gone, we think back to all the pleasures you have given us over the years, from your little parts in BREATHLESS and 400 BLOWS, to your most recent work discovering the Welsh coalminer's daughter Catherine Zeta Jones, and we are grateful to you for your inspired interventions and pizzazz.  Not since Ernst Lubitsch has flair been filmed so perfectly and gallantly, and not since Clouzot has action been so well blended with nail-biting suspense.  Our hearts are sad today and we wish your extended family well in these difficult days.  Belmondo and Cardinale are still with us and thanks to you, we will always have them in excelsis, as the perfect man and woman au cinema.  Merci, De Broca!",1101686400,6,899,4.670886075949367
7838714,4,6303103723,"A film that, for me, brings back all sorts of fond memories. I first saw it as a teenager during its initial American release in the 60's when I was just discovering that there were some really good films out there that weren't in English. I had loved That Man From Rio and here was the great Jean-Paul Belmondo re-united with director Philippe De Broca in a rollicking swashbuckler. And having the luscious Claudia Cardinale along for the ride didn't hurt either.

Cartouche (also known by the terrible title of Swords Of Blood) is a very French and very Sixties flick. De Broca's loose style of film making encompasses broad comedy, adventure, satire, romance and even tragedy. It is the same  style that made The King Of Hearts so memorable and it works just as well here. The story of a charming and incorrigible petty thief who rises to be a sort of bandit chief - after a comic interlude in the army - is the perfect excuse for fist fights, sword fights, chases, and romance with lusty wenches with wonderfully heaving bosoms. The flavor of the 18th century is beautifully captured with a realism that extends to the smallest details. At times, the realistic visuals seem almost at odds with some of the film's more slapstick elements, but it actually contributes to the superb period feel. In this respect, Cartouche is somewhat reminiscent of some of the bawdier bits from that other great Sixties period romp Tom Jones.

Jean-Paul Belmondo is perfect in the title role, not only more than equal to all the physical demands of the part but also moving through all his character's moods effortlessly. Belmondo is a wonderfully natural actor and it is hard to imagine anyone from Hollywood doing this sort of part so well. Co-star Claudia Cardinale has seldom been better or more beautiful - her character is well-named as Venus. She is overflowing with earthy passion both as an outlaw and a lover - even more so as a jealous lover. Both as a teenager and now as an allegedly wiser fifty-something, I could never understand why Belmondo would prefer the icy aristocratic Odile Versois to the magnificently sexy Cardinale.

As usual with these films, Belmondo gets a couple of sidekicks. One is a gentle giant played by Jess Hahn, a sort of European Alan Hale who was forever popping up in films of various languages. The other is a young Jean Rocheforte, that wonderful French actor who would have such a long and impressive career. Here he is The Mole, a slightly more refined bandit with the soul of a poet. The villains are suitably hateful, if not quite in the Basil Rathbone league.

Cartouche is great fun and blessed with true star quality performances from Belmondo and Cardinale. It's one of those movies that is always a joy to take out and watch again. If you're seeing it for the first time, you're in for a real treat.",1094774400,26,2838,4.690763052208835
7838715,4,6303103723,"The legendary Jean-Paul Belmondo stars as 18th Century swordsman, thief and rogue Bourguignon, alias CARTOUCHE.  But when he meets the beautiful bandit Venus (the luscious Claudia Cardinale), they launch a series of scandalous raids that rock the Parisian aristocracy.  The most wanted man in France is about to discover that true love may be the most dangerous caper of all.
The great Phillipe de Broca co-wrote and directed this sumptuous and surprising adventure. No extras, but in this case, the movie is more than enough.  Recommended.",1055289600,11,540,5.255813953488372
