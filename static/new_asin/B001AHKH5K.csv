8277522,5,B001AHKH5K,"YES! This is a real gem; MAYBE the Hawk is not completely in full power on every single cut, but most of the time in this DVD he is AWSOME; the best material (the film quality equivalent to the music quality) are:
- C. Hawkins - Harry ""Sweets"" Edison quintet (with Sir Charles Thompson on piano, Jimmy Woode on bass and Jo Jones, who also has a nice solo spot, on drums); taped in London in '64
- Bonus material: Coleman Hawkins-Roy Eldridge quintet (with Johnny Guarnieri on piano, Barry Galbraith on guitar, Milt Hinton on bass, Cozy Cole on drums and the singer Carol Stevens)

But THERE'S MORE! Coleman Hawkins - Benny Carter quintet is not restored visually and might give a problem or two for a viewer with some high-tec surround sound equipment,
but the performance is beautiful!
Having Teddy Wilson (p), Bob Cranshaw (b) and Louie Bellson (dm) in their corner doesn't really hurt...
And there's more:
One track of C. Hawkins quartet with Oscar Peterson, Sam Jones and Louis Hayes
plus C. Hawkins quintet with George Arvanitas (p), Mickey Baker (g), Jimmy Woode (b) and Kansas Fields (dm) - BTW - Kansas Fields is a great name - it even sounds like a stage name or something...

All in all, there's no cheating here - you get first class Coleman Hawkins for your money, a lot of hot blowing and muscular improvising by Hawk, lyrical by Edison and Carter and, well, hot by Eldridge and Carol Stevens....

I RECOMMEND IT!",1294704000,2,1426,4.606299212598425
