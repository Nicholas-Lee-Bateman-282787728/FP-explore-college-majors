Shows are good but the description says run time is an hour and 40 minutes when in reality it's only 35 minutes....that's not a lot for a fuzzy tales obsessed toddler. Needless to say I was disappointed at the length.",1490313600,,351,4.101449275362318

8634743,5,B00HR736O6,"Soooo cute! We saw clips of this adorable show on Disney Jr, and my 4 yr old was so excited when we found the Fuzzy Tales DVD. Adorable real animals acting out their version of classic stories with a cartoon background. And with some funny twists that my 4 yr old finds hilarious. Animal lover kids will be delighted. The stories are short, so you can watch them all or just a few.",1408838400,2,381,4.232876712328767
