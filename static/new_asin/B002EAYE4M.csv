3916551,5,B002EAYE4M,"Some of the folks who have reviewed this edition of the DVD (here and elsewhere) have derided the live-recording of the soundtrack. Sure, there will be laughing--some of it in more opportune places than others. However, it's a wonderfully composed score in the true silent film style and extremely well-performed. The picture quality is good; each title card is easily read and is on screen for an acceptable amount of time (unfortunately, this is not *always* the case for Warner Archive DVDs, but *is* the case, generally).

If you're a Garbo and/or Gilbert fan, this film is a must-add for your collection.",1360540800,,609,4.970588235294118
3916552,5,B002EAYE4M,"""Love"" is a very well done and touching movie. It is an excellent silent movie. I wish they would have released this DVD with a better soundtrack, however. The score was recorded live at a showing of the movie in Los Angeles and you can hear the audience at times laughing, coughing, murmuring. The coughing and murmuring would be bearable, but the laughing is very annoying...I don't understand the audience's humor...one example is when the candle nightlight in the boy's room gets blown out when Anna opens the door and there is Vronsky outside the door...the meaning of this scene is impending doom because Anna has just told the boy that if the light goes out it will bring bad fortune. I have no idea why the audience laughed. Obviously, they and I do not share the same sense of humor. The laughter is only occasional, but never-the-less, annoying.

Another complaint about the soundtrack is that although the score itself is really rather pretty and at times quite lovely, it does not have the necessary intensity, depth, and darkness. The score should be a powerful one for a movie like this. Instead, the score is very light, more appropriate for a chamber concert or for a story of a rather pleasant idyll in the country. Also, the same few orchestral themes are reused throughout the movie. I wish Turner Classic Movies had done their young composers competition for original scoring of silent movies like they did with the movie set of ""The Temptress,"" ""Flesh and the Devil,"" and ""The Mysterious Lady."" A well done orchestral score can turn a good silent movie into an AMAZING (yes, I'm using caps because I am shouting) silent movie. Maybe someday they will rescore it; then of course we will have to buy another DVD; which seems inevitable with collecting movies as there are often other editions that come available. (Just look how many editions there are of ""Gone with the Wind""...I have to keep re-buying it to get the latest features.)

Your options for this movie soundtrack are to pretend you're at the live performance (which if I had been I would have borrowed Rhett Butler's line from ""Gone with the Wind"" and told the audience...""I'll thank you to shut your stupid mouth."") and bear with it. Or, you can turn the sound completely down and have a total silent movie. Or, you can have the sound completely down and put on a CD of your own. I am thankful to have this film on DVD at all, as this is certainly better than nothing.

I had heard there was a happy ending and a sad ending to this movie. This DVD only has the happy ending. Comparing this version of Tolstoy's novel with the one Garbo did later, ""Anna Karenina"", I enjoy both versions. Gilbert is definitely a more sympathetic characterization of Vronsky than March. With March, I always wish he would have to die...he comes across as a cad rather than really caring about Anna and after having her give everything up he leaves her to go back to his regiment and pursue the young princess. Gilbert, on the other hand, comes across with a softer, more caring persona. And, it's Anna that leaves him so that he will go back to his regiment and won't ruin his career. The love and care seems more mutual in this version. But, Garbo's emotional performance in the later one is unbeatable. It's worth owning both movies. Garbo's scenes with her son in both movies are very sweet and heartwarming. And she looks gorgeous in both as well.",1358208000,10,3415,4.650662251655629
3916553,5,B002EAYE4M,"Note: I saw this film when it aired this morning on Turner Classic Movies.

Having recently seen the 1935 version starring Greta Garbo & Frederic March, I wanted to see this silent screen version of Leo Tolstoy's classic novel. It's a good, though very condensed, adaptation of the novel. Greta Garbo, of course, shines as Anna. John Gilbert is pompous and tender as Vronsky. (He reminds me of Tobey Maguire & Orlando Bloom). The kid who played Anna's son is cute, and I liked all there scenes together. The film has two endings: a happy one supposedly filmed for American audiences and the tragic ending which is more in line with Tolstoy's novel. I like the happy ending for a change. The tragic ending is too abrupt, in my opinion, and therefore, you cannot sympathise with Anna. The happy ending, on the other hand, is much better for this version.

Unfortunately, this presentation was recorded live, and you can hear coughing & laughter along with clapping at the end. The laughter occurs at the most inopportune times, and that frequently, which tends to break the mood of the film. Hence, the four stars.

Not Rated.",1347926400,6,1124,4.753846153846154
3916554,5,B002EAYE4M,"One criticism--and only one.  The sound track could be better.  The occasional laughter (live audience) in the background is annoying at times, but for Pete's sake, this film is more than a sound track; it's Gilbert and Garbo!  It doesn't get any better than that. Gilbert is dashing, and his natural, playful sense of humor adds fun to an otherwise serious role.  Garbo is beautiful and brilliant.  If you compare this abridged version of ""Anna Karenina"" with the other ""Anna Karenina"" starring Frederick March, you'll see why I find ""Love"" so alluring.  In ""Love,"" Gilbert and Garbo sizzle.  In ""Anna Karenina,"" Garbo and March fizzle.  Maybe that's because Garbo was in ""Love"" with Gilbert on and off screen. As far as I'm concerned, the superb acting makes up for the flawed musical score.",1298419200,4,793,4.909774436090226
3916555,1,B002EAYE4M,"Here is a copy of an e-mail I sent to Turner Classic Movies:

I recently purchased three Greta Garbo silent film DVDs through your Web site: ""Wild Orchids,"" ""Love,"" and ""The Single Standard.""  Given the quality, the price of $17.99 - with no restoration whatsoever, and on discs that won't play on a computer - is outrageous.  $9.99 might be more in line with the quality of the product, with the films lasting on average about 75 minutes.  However, I am absolutely OUTRAGED at the audio track provided for ""Love.""  It was recorded live at a showing of the film, apparently in Los Angeles, to an audience unfamiliar with the acting styles of silent films, that actors had to use facial gestures - sometimes exaggerated - to convey what they could not do with spoken words due to the technology of the time.  Throughout the DVD of ""Love"" - which is the story of Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"" - audience laughter is heard, VERY loud and VERY clear, in the most inappropriate places.  This is an affront to your customers, a disgrace to what I though TCM stood for, and a huge dishonor to two of MGMs greatest stars.  Have you no respect for the icons of the past?  Whoever decided to release this DVD with this audio track deserves to be fired.  I suppose the chances of TCM ever preparing a DVD of ""Love"" with a proper soundtrack - even a simple solo synthesizer would be a vast improvement - fall under the category of ""snowballs in hell.""  The next time I want a DVD of a film controlled by TCM, I'll search for someone who recorded it from TV and is selling it on the Internet.  The price will be better and the quality certainly can't be worse.  I repeat: I am utterly OUTRAGED.",1251849600,49,1677,4.459016393442623
3916556,4,B002EAYE4M,"My rating for this film has to do with the product and the film, not with the wisdom of buying it here versus directly from Warner Bros for under twenty dollars. This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R made with the finest material Warner currently has available with no further restoration done. There are no chapter stops. You may only go forward or backwards in ten minute intervals.

This silent film has the famous lovers John Gilbert and Greta Garbo as Captain Count Alexei Vronsky and Anna Karenina, respectively. The two meet during a blizzard. Anna's carriage is detained because of it, and she has to stay the night in a nearby inn, with her travel there assisted by Count Vronsky. Her face has been covered up because of the blizzard, but once inside the inn she uncovers her face and Vronsky is instantly smitten. Even the maid at the inn feels the chemistry between the two and places Vronsky's and Anna's things in the same room, believing them to be married. There is one impediment to the pair's happiness though - Anna is married to a senator and has a son by him. Any spark that was ever there has gone out of the marriage, but Anna feels a duty to her station in life and above all, her son. Vronsky and Anna keep running into each other at government functions until they can no longer stop themselves, ultimately running off to Italy together. However, Anna has had to leave her son behind at the insistence of her husband, and soon she finds herself missing him. Once back in Russia, Vronsky's superior officer visits Anna and tells her that Vronsky will be thrown out of the service if the affair continues. She agrees to leave him if it will save Vronsky's career. There are two endings that were released with this film - a happy ending in America, and a sad one abroad. Here you are getting the happy ending.

The visual quality of the film is good, even if it is a bit soft looking. However, the deal breaker is probably the soundtrack. The score was recorded at a live performance, and the music chosen is good enough. However, the music was recorded at a college showing of this film. In any audience you would probably hear the occasional coughing in the background. Here, though, you'll hear loud laughter whenever the crowd finds something funny, and they apparently find something funny quite often and at the most inappropriate times, such as the first time Vronsky sees Anna's face and smiles at her. It just ruins the mood of the whole film. The audience was probably filled with teenagers with nothing better to do on this particular night.

I would highly recommend the film, but the price and especially the score and the ""sound effects"" will probably leave you feeling taken.

The film = 4/5
The presentation = 3/5 mainly because of the laughter in the soundtrack
I'll be kind and round up to 4 stars, but just be warned.",1246665600,29,2869,4.575875486381323
8367191,5,B002EAYE4M,A classic in my eyes. Garbo/Gilbert looked their youthful best. A must see for Fans of Silent Films.  Arnold Brostoff wrote a beautiful score to make the film come alive. Garbo had more spirit in this film than her later re-make of the film. This film was recorded with a live performance and uses the happy ending version rather than the tragic original version.  Key note there is some laughing recorded because people were not in tune with the art of Silent Film making. At the end of the film the same people were cheering.,1518825600,,527,4.536842105263158
8367192,4,B002EAYE4M,"Left off one star only because of the quality of the DVD.

The movie is as wonderful as one would expect a John Gilbert-Greta Garbo movie to be. Beautifully acted as Garbo shows what a wonderful an actress she was to become. John Gilbert is so handsome in his uniform and with his stunning smile. The best male silent film actor and heartthrob of his time. (his career as a super star romantic lead was cut short mostly by the conniving Louis B. Mayer, and by circumstances to do with movies going from silent to ""talkies"". But to understand all that there are some good books about the era).

The cinematography on this film is lovely. Scenes of snow covered Russia  lend to the atmosphere and beauty.  Just to think of those early set designers and cinematographers creating these films is a wonder and will inspire an appreciation of the power of inventiveness and spectacular artistry. Today's filmmakers would be hard pressed to make such movies.

Even though this film was to be titled ""Anna Karenina"", the ending I saw was not true to the novel. I understand that there is another ending to the movie but I have not seen it.  MGM changed the title of the movie when it was discovered that Gilbert and Garbo were an actual couple offscreen. Executives were thrilled that they had an exploitation that would sell a lot of tickets by calling the movie ""Love"", as they would advertise ""Gilbert and Garbo in 'Love' ""!

This print of ""Love"", thankfully, also has a very good score composed for it and is included on the film track, making a very nice potential package indeed.

Such a good movie. Why only ""potential""?  So where's the rub?  Unbelievably this wonderful film is recorded off a screening before a live audience  (Obviously an unsophisticated audience at that.) One can hear inappropriate laughter and other audience noises--and this certainly ruins the film.  Due to a filming of a film(!) the visual quality is poor.

Amazon, why would you sell this DVD?  MGM, why would you release this?  You have a good copy of the movie.

Amazon, you should tell MGM you're not going to release bad DVDs, or in the description you should warn potential buyers that their movie experience will be less than good. Honestly, even if this were given away, it's not a good deal.

I recommend turning off the sound. Find some music you deem appropriate and play that. Too bad, as there is a perfectly lovely score that is wasted.  And that's a lot of extra work.",1489276800,,2459,4.63972286374134

8367196,5,B002EAYE4M,"The cinematography is stunning, and the story line is engaging.  This film is a winner.

I read other reviews warning about the soundtrack, so I tried the Chopin nocturnes as a score
and found them to work beautifully as a complement to the emotional narrative of this film.
If you wish to try the same, just go to you-tube --
you'll find there complete sets of Nocturnes, each accessible from a single link.

I don't think I'll ever listen to the soundtrack that came with this video.

Over time I have purchased every Garbo silent that I can get my hands on and have found
every one of them rewarding.  If you respond positively to these films, I recommend that you try others.",1400630400,3,679,4.487804878048781
