succeeds in only leaving the viewer with one question - Why did I waste my money buying this? In my opinion, no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",1019520000,11,267,4.36
900927,4,6304595379,"Less than an hour long, Jack Walsh delivers a mixture of personal biography and Dr. Strangelove-like science fiction. Through a blend of experimental montage and voice-over story telling, he recounts how the young Carlos, the son of an alcoholic mother and a deceased war veteran, became involved in an anti-fascist cell dedicated to making agitprop films against Christian fundamentalists who are executing a coup d'etat in the U.S. Though fact and paranoia often merge, and the filming and acting sometimes slip, the result remains surprisingly real and unfortunately timely.",1014336000,3,577,5.49438202247191

I watched the first 20 or so minutes and kept hoping that it would start to get better--or at least start to make sense, but it didn't.  I closed out of it at that point figuring it had wasted enough of my time.  So sorry, but I would recommend that you do ANYTHING else with your time than waste it on this film.",1454889600,,440,3.965909090909091

901018,5,6304595379,"I think this film is misunderstood because it is being categorized and reaching the wrong audiences. At 55 minutes long, it is part art film, part cautionary tale, perhaps part propaganda. The cover art is misleading. Though it is an image from the film, the film is not a gay love story. It's not even targeted at the typical audience for gay films. The film's lead character, Carlos is gay. There are some erotic images in the film but one of those involves a M/M rape near the end. This film represents the disenfranchised. Even though it was produced 20 years ago, it's message is as important today as it was when it was made. The film's focus surrounds anti-gay and anti-semite activities.

At one point Carlos is cornered and asked what it is he hopes to gain from his 'subversive' activities and his response is, ""I just want to live my life."" This film isn't against religion but it does explore what happens when any one group with specific beliefs has too much power.

This film is for those that have been attacked, alienated, or witnessed the brutality that occurs when power and fear are allowed to supersede equality and freedom.

If you watch it, you need to watch it to the end to get it. It probably won't 'hook' you in the first 10-15 minutes.",1451692800,11,1262,4.5506607929515415

901071,1,6304595379,"This movie is an hour of the most poorly told story with some inept acting to help it along.  From the obvious symbolism of the two smoke stacks towering over the two young men meeting to the grainy, pseudo-documentary footage, this movie is irritating from the get go.  Don't let the cover fool you, as it did me.  That image comes about three times in the movie and means almost nothing.  Don't waste your time and money on this one.  It's price is the only thing that is of high quality.  It is not enlightening, uplifting or entertaining.  Why bother?!",1099612800,29,556,4.5
901072,4,6304595379,"""The Second Coming,"" directed by Jack Walsh, takes place in an alternate or near future United States.  A Christian fundamentalist sect called the Allied Forces of God is attempting to establish a theocracy, and in this viciously homophobic atmosphere a young gay Latino man named Carlos becomes involved in a resistance movement.  At 53 minutes, this is a relatively short film.
""Second Coming"" is thought-provoking and stylishly made; the soundtrack is effective and there are some really haunting visual images.  But ultimately I found the film less than satisfying.  At times the film is heavy-handed, and some parts struck me as too contrived.  A key problem with the film is its portrayal of anti-gay Christian fundamentalism.  The film's ""Christian Right"" is like a hard-to-believe cartoon compared to today's slicker, media savvy Christian Right activists.  And rather than open up dialogue between gay rights supporters and conservative Christians, this film seems like it would just widen the chasms already existing in our culture.",1075334400,4,1042,5.395061728395062
901073,3,6304595379,"This movie is not great but it is worth watching.
Everytime I hear the President use the use the term ""the citizenry . . .,"" or ""the citizens"", I think about this movie.  He sounds way to much like the religious right president in this movie.
No, we are no where close to the premise coming true but there are enough similarities with current events to make this movie worth watching.
The movie is strongly left-wing.  So the irony of critizing the religious right while embracing an equally totalatarian alternative is a big detraction.
But once you get past the left wing politics of the script, there is a part of this movie that works and thus makes worth your time.
As other reviewers suggested, there is no sex to speak of in this movie (which based on the cover you might expect there to be).  Watch this if you want a short but provactive movie that will at least make you think.",1060473600,2,887,4.429447852760736
901074,1,6304595379,"Hi Everybody,
  When a film is written, produced and directed by the same person ya know  you're in for a bumpy ride. Jack Walsh is in the driver's seat, and he's DUI. Too bad somebody didn't pull him over before he made this trip to nowhere. This black and white film is a whiny, nonsensical, and totally unfathomable piece about  some kids who get upset because some right wing group is threatening to detonate the nukes at The Bureau of Standards if somebody doesn't convene a constitutional convention to rewrite the Constitution in terms avowing Christian values.  (Exactly!  The nukes at the Burea of Standards!  I  thought the BOS housed like clocks and stuff.)
A Jew and an Hispanic homosexual link up. These 2  highschoolers send out underground messages  that are less poignant than Bart Simpson's board notes, yet one is killed and the other tortured and killed for their efforts. It's all very confusing.
I'm truly sorry I paid almost $...for this waste. No sex to sspeak of...
Don't get in the car with this Walsh guy. He ain't got a clue where he's going.",1052092800,3,1069,4.698924731182796

This film is more about how the powers that be, and how our government, can control our way of thinking. The film is propaganda. Artistic, melancholy, and cute - I enjoyed the female narrator speaking on behalf of the male protagonist. It's not as slow as other art films; as others may suggest.
