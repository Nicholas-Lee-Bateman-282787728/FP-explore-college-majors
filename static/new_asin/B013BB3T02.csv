7361412,5,B013BB3T02,"Another great film from Adullam, this documentary deserves much more attention than it is currently receiving. Through diligent research and investigation, the filmmakers resolve a long-pondered mystery in the conspiracy community. The time put into making Dark Clouds Over Elberton was well worth it in my opinion, due to the fact that many of the key players involved in this tale are in their latter years, and will probably not be around much longer to tell their stories. Without the interviews conducted with them by the filmmakers, the true story of the Georgia Guidestones quite possibly would have been forever lost with their passing. All Adullam films have high production value and are very well put together, and this one is no different. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to solve the mystery and find out the true story behind the creation of the enigmatic and strange Guidestones.",1446249600,19,904,5.073825503355705
7361413,5,B013BB3T02,"Very well done, Adullam. This topic has been an interest of mine for a long time. This documentary is very informative and well researched. I highly recommend giving it a watch for anyone!",1443916800,,188,4.7272727272727275
7361414,5,B013BB3T02,"Wow, this film is awesome. These filmmakers have uncovered the identity of the mysterious man behind the Georgia Guidestones. I love these movies that Adullam Films keep putting out. These director/actors/researchers/editors have TALENT! They also do a fantastic job of exposing New Ageism, Occult, and liberal agendas, while also standing up for the Bible and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I highly recommend watching this film. It will keep you on the edge of your seat! In fact, watch all of Adullam Films movies. They will not disappoint you.

It is so hard to find God-friendly movies that are actually good to watch. Most Hollywood movies are nothing but trash that promote sin and take God's name in vain every other second. However, with these films, Pinto and his team put together incredible stories to help you realize hidden agendas taking place in the world. Wake up, folks! They are very eye-opening and fascinating.

I even like Pinto's narrator voice and his catch phrase when making a point in all of his films: ""Could it be that.....""

Looking forward to the new Babylon movie!",1440028800,18,1089,4.934426229508197

7361416,3,B013BB3T02,"I live about 10 minutes from the Guidestones. The narrator kept calling it ""Elberton County"" - it's the city of Elberton, but called Elbert County. I wish they had stopped badgering Mr. Martin out in his shed. I know people want answers, but badgering a man well into his 80's that was directly involved with ""R.C. Christian"" is inappropriate, as was taking pictures of envelopes with addresses in the computer case. I guess I've lived here so long and have heard ALL kinds of stories, it is just not a big deal to me - a lot of other locals will probably agree. The documentary was drawn out but it was okay. I personally don't think there was anything satanic or whatever intended with the stones, but then again, it's a mystery and it's ok to stay that way.",1501200000,2,760,4.474820143884892

This would be a good film to watch for someone who isn't aware of what the New World Order, along with their secret societies, are all about, and what they have in mind for our lives.  It's reAl, folks, and it's been around for centuries.  It's just reached the point that they don't care who knows what anymore, but knowledge is always good, so one can prepare the best they can, or at least, not be left wondered what's going on.

7361421,3,B013BB3T02,"It was built in 1980, using cranes.  The film tries to make it sound like there is a big secret behind how it was built.  The only secret is who paid the $$ to build it..  No surprise it turns out to be racist, who believe, some people should live and reproduce, and others should be sterilized.  The movie is way too long, and tries to be suspenseful, but is really just long winded.  They waste time talking to people who have only a fringe involvement.  If you decide to watch it, just skip to the 4th section.  They will repeat about everything they said in the first 3 sections.",1486512000,2,583,4.245454545454545

About a quarter of the way through the documentary after seeing the configuration of the stones it was a little obvious this was a ""master"" race sort of monument. From the top they are configured in the fashion of a swastika. At least, that's the first thing that came to my mind.

I would recommend this to friends.",1475971200,,548,4.581632653061225

7361436,4,B013BB3T02,"This didn't need to be as long as it was, although it was a good documentary.  There could have been more editing of the Elberton footage since it seemed they kept interviewing people who were bound and determined to keep RC Christian's identity a secret. The real reveal comes up in the last 20 minutes or so of the film. When I finished watching, I couldn't help but think there should have been a part 2 to this story. Who else was involved in the Guidestone project since RC indicated more than once that a group of people were backing him?

One of the most interesting aspects for me personally, is the fact that RC professed to be a Christian, but apparently didn't believe what Jesus taught regarding mankind. Another reviewer seemed to think the filmmaker was somehow saying that non-Christians can't be compassionate and missed the point entirely. Lots of people profess to be Christian but there's little evidence to show it. Overall, this was a good documentary, but it might be a disappointment to the conspiracy theorists who linked the monument to the Illuminati.",1475884800,3,1077,4.78494623655914

7361445,2,B013BB3T02,"This ""documentary"" starts out in a promising manner, but by the end the narrator/writer has revealed himself as something of a hack. He obtains information unethically, without the permission of his interview subjects. The last 1/3 of the film is speculation, and seems more a hasty conclusion to shock the audience than a conclusion drawn from patient and rigorous study. It ends by insulting anyone who is not a Christian by insinuating that only Christians are capable of not being racist and instead being compassionate to all fellow humans.

7361470,5,B013BB3T02,Chris Pinto is a masterful storyteller. He always backs up controversial issues with Bible verses. This subject matter is controversial but so is the Word of God to those who have not received it with a readiness of mind. This is an important work as the background story is told in the context of the times in which it came about. It is also not a knee jerk reaction to the guidestone's edicts but delves into the writings of its architects and their world view as misguided as the were. Saving the earth is not something mankind will ever achieve since men neither created it nor do they have the power to change it. The bottom line is that what is truly important is not what men think but with God says.,1469750400,,707,4.363636363636363
7361471,4,B013BB3T02,"The big news here is that this filmmaker has, very likely, got to the bottom of a mystery mainstream news organizations have, either ignored, or failed at.  This modest, but nicely put together, investigatory piece has revealed the idenity of a Dr. Kirsten from Fort Dodge, Iowa as the main perpetrator, and architect, of The Georgia Guidestones monument.

Since it was first revealed The Georgia Guidestones monument has been a controversial landmark.  It has likely been more trouble to the small town of Elberton, Georgia than a world famous tourist attration.  How this came to be in a small conservative rural town is almost as much of the mystery as the monument itself.  In this it's a bit amazing no national news organization ever probed this enigmatic, super controversial, landmark as this filmmaker.  Without any trappings of the now ""showy"" nature of investigative reality TV shows, with their teams of ex-CIA agents, big agency journalists, historians et.al., this production goes further and actually reveals a highly probable answer to a mystery.  It does so simply and without heroics.  Just good investigative work without a need to stretch out for an entire season of nothing.  I applaud this humble production as such.

Many of us know a little about how a mysterious man, openly using a psuedonym of R.C. Christian, swept into the granite center of Eberton, Georgia resulting in the manufacture and errection of The Georgia Guidestones.  After this we know little save for the controversy the precepts etched continue to create.  This film recaps the story nicely filling in many blanks with interviews of locals, and businesses, who were connected  It's a very interesting mystery to be sure.  It all culminates when the only person claiming to actually know who R.C. Christian is allows a huge reveal without breaking his own word not to ever tell.  By allowing a few letters to be viewed for the first time, likely ever, the clues begin to gel into a specific place with a related name (not R.C. Christian himself).  By connecting these dots it becomes clear enough for a strong case of circumstantial evidence that would likely hold up in a court of law.  Mystery solved?  More than likely, but there remains one question about the supposed time capsule to which the date of opening is left blank.  Is there actually a time capsule and will there be a time in the future some organization, perhaps The Rosacrucians, will instruct the date to be filled in?  Possibly, but like any big mystery there still remains more unanswered questions.  In spite of this this film gets to what many consider the big one as to who in the world would actually want to construct such a radical ediface.",1469750400,7,2710,4.899122807017544
7361472,3,B013BB3T02,"Really? I was bored one night, and decided to watch this. It appears that one man put his world view on some granite stones in Georgia, and I don't agree with his philosophy at all. It is not a Christian viewpoint, and not really atheist either. If I had enough money, I'd buy it and sandblast the words off, and sell the remaining stones, or put the 10 commandments on the stones, and 'In God We Trust'.

However, it turns out he would prefer to also limit which races exist! Unfortunately we live in a society that throws the baby out with the bathwater. Cosby comes to mind.

Instead of watching this movie read Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason.

Just don't expect to find to find any age of reason in the closed minds of fundamentalists. However, if Mystery Science Theater 3000 comes back this will make a hilarious show and only then will it be worth your time.",1467158400,5,531,4.888888888888889

If you are into historical mysteries and potentially solving them than this would be the film for you.  This film takes out some of the sensationalism that has surrounded the Georgia Guidestones mystery and replaces it with real research. In this reviewer's opinion the film makers have finally solved a thirty year mystery while revealing disturbing trends that underlay our political and social system.

If you subscribe to their motives, you probably swallow everything they produce - without question.  This is the latest in a line of propaganda drivel. Do a little basic research on this one and you will quickly find that the producers tactics and strategy behind this one were so vile, so unethical that even some of the planned ""conspiracy theorists"" felt icky and dropped out of participating.  I actually live in elberton, so I'm familiar with some of the on screen talent...and the hypocritical divergence between their on screen personas and the way they live their lives - hiding all manner of ills behind a facade of piety.

The dude was obviously highly (or lowly) connected, depending upon your respective perspective.  The scumbags of the earth rule it.  That's a fact.  The real question is, ""How do we respond?""

Christian"").  Although I have been intrigued with the Georgia Guidestones over the last 35 years, my own research always came to a dead-end at the ""Rosicrucian"" explanation; however, this documentary delivers the full history of the Guidestones in detail and with a startling, definitive explanation of R.C.
