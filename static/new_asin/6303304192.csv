7842902,3,6303304192,"The original title of this film was Sigurd Drakedreper, Sigurd the Dragon-slayer. It was made in 1989, but it wasn't shown in US cinemas until 1995. The movie wears its pacifist heart on its sleeve, and was clearly made on something of a budget. It follows the vicissitudes of a young Viking, Sigurd, who is expected to follow in his father's footsteps as a great hero, but who gradually steers his tribe towards a less warlike path. Of course, in historical terms, it's absolute nonsense, but then that's not the point. So long as one accepts it for the New Age hokum it is, it is a surprisingly enjoyable way of passing 85 minutes of one's life. And not the least charm of the film is the complete absence of any heterosexual romance for its young protagonist. Were this film made today, and in Britain, the writers would feel a need to give the hero some sort of romantic interest with a girl, in accordance with the modern obsession with throwing boys and girls together at the earliest possible opportunity. Sigurd, however, evinces not the slightest sexual or romantic interest in the only girl who plays a significant role in the narrative. Instead, when Sigurd confronts the son of the chief of the neighbouring, and rival, tribe, in the forest, they gaze at each other with obvious interest. Sigurd also enjoys a rather sweet relationship with a captured Frankish lad. They become very close friends, and are quite comfortable being completely naked with each other in one scene, only rushing to put their trousers on when a girl appears. This is also a significant difference to any modern film, for boys are nowadays taught to be rather awkward and ashamed of their bodies even in front of other boys. By contrast, the only obvious purpose served by the scene where the boys strip is to give the viewer an opportunity to admire the two lads' youthful physiques (though I ought to add for the sake of clarity that everything is shot above the waist, except for a single blink-and-you'll-miss-it scene of rear nudity taken from a distance).

Essentially, the plot of this film is about how love between boys can overcome the insanity of the adult world and create a utopia. What a beautiful idea! So, yes, there are aspects of this film which are completely risible, but the film has a certain charm nonetheless. Its obvious deficiencies resulted in its being ridiculed at the time, but in comparison with films made now, its merits stand out more clearly than its weaknesses.",1441929600,,2485,4.752314814814815
7842903,5,6303304192,"One of the best anti-war films ever made, though I am sure unintentionally. Kristian Tonby is the youngest son of the Viking King. He hates all the war and battles around him, but is forced by custom and his father to live up to being a valiant Viking, but he just can't. The ending is one of the best ever.",1435968000,,307,4.133333333333334
7842904,5,6303304192,"Incredible movie! Was a favorite of mine when I was a kid and wish that it had been popular enough for there to be a DVD version now. I looked over some of the other reviews and was kind of surprised they weren't all positive! Of course it's not as epic as Braveheart, etc.. but it's also a kids film. As a young Norwegian kid growing up, this movie was the s***. This movie will always get 5+ stars from me!",1435363200,,408,4.049382716049383
7842905,4,6303304192,"As an independent film maker myself, this movie had great scenery, great costuming, but the sound quality is not good,the acting is also not good, the story itself is rather unplanned and amateurish, but other than that its a great kids movie, i would recommend it for kids.",1289347200,,274,4.729166666666667
7842906,1,6303304192,"I found this movie, in a word, awful.  Cheaply done, and quite corny, it's all just a set-up to give a person the ""willies"".  The sets were decent enough, but the acting and costumes are... bizzare.  For instance, the young viking obviously does not have blonde hair, so they set a thick wig upon his head.

  The acting is less than quality. It's safe for young children to watch, but I don't know how long they'll stay interested.  All-in-all, this movie makes a good unintentional comedy.  If you like cheaply done movies - go for it.",1126915200,,537,4.520833333333333
