7697428,5,B01D5KI4M2,"This is the one I have been waiting for! Mr. Parsons has a GREAT band, and each contributes 100%.. I have some of the inferior quality DVD releases and have enjoyed those performances, but this one sounds and looks GREAT!! It is a wonderful set list of hits and fan favorites. Having the entire TURN OF A FRIENDLY CARD suite is huge for me, and LA SAGRADA FAMILIA is bombastic! Each member shines and watching this I get the feeling they enjoy playing this music. They are enthused and smile a lot! Their passion notches this project to a very high level.. (If you read this Mr. Parsons, thank you for releasing this! And ""hint hint"" while I know it is expensive to do, it would be great to get 5.1 mixes of TOAFC, GAUDI, STEREOTOMY and then the rest of the catalog!)  For fans, this was very enjoyable to me and I highly recommend it! PLAY IT LOUD and if you have it, use the 5.1 audio mix to listen!!",1463616000,5,902,4.2748538011695905
7697429,5,B01D5KI4M2,"Having the fortune to have seen Alan Parsons Live THR3E times in 2015 (in the Northeast USA), this DVD will be nothing but superb and only exceeded by those live performances. Superb musicianship, camaraderie and production, the high quality catalog come to life live.

7697435,5,B01D5KI4M2,After watching this last night I couldn't be more impressed! Ive seen a few line ups he's had through the years but this one is exceptional. The symphony accompaniment added was very effective. I felt foolish when I caught myself clapping after most of the songs. I got emotional when they played Time. I would say its well worth the money if it cost three times what I paid! One small complaint was I had to use a lot of volume to get a satisfactory sound. Just turn it up to 11 and your good!,1517875200,,494,4.2105263157894735
7697436,5,B01D5KI4M2,"The concert and sound recording are done well. The sound is nicely mixed such that bass is not overblown.

""La Sagrada Familia"", ""The Turn of a Friendly Card"", and ""Damned If I Do"" are among the standout songs.",1517097600,,387,4.608695652173913

I  know if I had a good disc I would love to have this in my collection. I will be asking for a new disc sent to me after I have the time to check out the other blueray concerts on this order.to make sure there ok. also the bass is messed up on this disc you have to turn your subwoofer way up compared to any blueray that has dts.

7697452,3,B01D5KI4M2,"I love the music and some of the renditions of these old hits are well done, but the performance just lacks energy. Not that I expect AP to get up on top of the amps and wind out his guitar, but Games People Play is a borderline rock anthem and falls a bit flat live here. If you are a true APP fan get it, if you like a few of his hits from the 80's, its probably not for you.",1498435200,,377,3.6666666666666665

It sounds so good backed by the orchestra, and it's calmer paced than many concert videos, with fewer edits and quick cuts, you get to see what the drummer's doing, the guitarists, etc. and plenty of footage of the orchestra.  Really a great production you will assume with Alan overseeing this project.  I would have liked a little more low-end .. but that's just my taste that's all.

7697465,3,B01D5KI4M2,"Sound is really bad... Barely can hear the drums and bass. Drums sound like they are really far away and muffled.
And the overall volume is really low. I normally play everything at volume level 4, in this one it has to be 14 at least.",1489190400,2,235,4.130434782608695
7697466,3,B01D5KI4M2,"Great setlist, great show, good filming, amateurish audio mix. They let the Colombian TV tape this like they did in Chile in '95 and later in Spain, both with great results, only this time around it didn't work out quite well. Quite a long, almost 2 hs. setlist, razor-sharp pic, and a plethora of camera angles makes this a joy to watch

Vocals are annoyingly high in the mix on most songs, volume and bottom end (general bass level) varies wildly from song to song and the keyboards, sax and string section of the orchestra  is bright and shrill. Same with the choir. Guitar sounds sedated and the only thing you can hear well from the drums is the kick drum. I lowered the treble a notch but that killed the already weak guitar sound. OAPN the imaging is fantastic; you can pinpoint every instrument just nicely.

Seek the '95 chilian TV show online, It's a fantastic quality show and easy to obtain if you know where to look.

And get this on the cheap.",1489104000,,957,4.451428571428571

7697479,5,B01D5KI4M2,"This is nothing less than a stunning production. Alan and P.J. did the mastering and it is masterful! But it is just as much about how great the music itself is. Alan's (and dare I say Eric's?) work over the years serves as the best of the best in Prog Rock. This disc proves that once again. The pure synergy of the full orchestra, choir, and APP Live band is more than obvious. If you start watching/ listening to this disc, be prepared to not be able to move out of your chair until it is over. Even then, you may be compelled to go back and replay parts like Silence And I. On a footnote - As a music event producer, I have had the honor to meet and talk to Alan on several occasions. I introduced him to the music of TransAtlantic many years ago. He is gracious, and in smaller venue settings almost always comes out after the show to meet fans and sign CDs, etc. I believe that the APP Live will be performing for years to come at the same level of perfection seen and heard on this disc.",1483488000,,994,4.128865979381444

It has all the big hits and more, performed meticulously by Parsons' crack band and The Philharmonic Orchestra of Medellin.  Having seen the band last year in NYC (without an orchestra) this is a nice record of that night, as he has virtually the same band.

7697484,4,B01D5KI4M2,"If you like Alan Parson's stuff, I am pretty sure you will like this.
The video quality is very good and the audio quality is very good. The song selection is very good.
I saw some comments by other folks about pj olsen's singing not being up to par. I disagree with that, I think he does an awesome job and often sounds better than woolfson. Some folks said parson's singing was bad, it isn't he isn't stevie wonder, but he sounds the same as he does on the records and put forth a very servicable job. The only downside vocally, and it is not a deal breaker by any means, is the rock grunt is missing from the lenny zakatek songs.
The only downside from an audio perspective is the audience is mixed very low. To some this will be a good thing, I just find at the end of a song it sounds like they mustn't have liked it very much, but then you see them yelling clapping and jumping up and down and realise it is an audio illusion.
This is a very good document of an alan parson's project concert and the orchestra also fills it out and it sounds great.",1482710400,,1054,4.146341463414634
7697485,5,B01D5KI4M2,"Alan is still going strong.  All of us that are APP fans realize that we keep buying the same songs over and over again in different formats, productions and styles, but even so, the enjoyment of hearing these songs performed never goes away.  The fullness of sound the quality of the performance and the melodic flow is like an old blanket that lends a sense of security.  Regarding this live performance: Hooray for releasing it in HD/Master, all APP releases should be in this format, just the shear complexities should dictate this.  The Blu-Ray quality is flawless.
The performers top tier especially the orchestra. Note: watch the orchestra enjoying the performance when they are not involved, there are a lot of smiles.  I was sharing in those smiles as I watched and listened.  If you are an APP fan, add this to your collection.  If you are just discovering Alan Parsons, I envy your journey through the discography. The first, second and third listen is by far the best.  It takes three listens to grasp all that is going on.  To Alan;  the years are passing....please one more major release, we would be truly grateful!  RIP: Eric Woolfson",1482364800,2,1150,4.757575757575758

I could tell the vocals were not performed by the original singers on some songs, but still well done.  The orchestra does a great job also.  The only nitpick I have with the video is there are a lot of people back and side stage you can see moving around, which is a distraction, as is some of the orchestra musicians checking their smartphones and talking during the concert.",1481846400,,513,4.3578947368421055

The set list is as great as any APP fan would expect, and even though it doesn't include Winding me Up or If I Could Change Your Mind (for obvious reasons), it's amazing to see the band perform their best songs supported by the Medellin Philharmonic Orchestra, which in my opinion, did a terrific job! The audio is great and video is pretty good even though at some points in looks a bit grainy, probably due to the video equipment used to capture the show. This concert was originally broadcasted live on local TV. From a production standpoint it is not the most mind blowing show but who cares? It's all about the music!

7697514,5,B01D5KI4M2,If you are a Parsons fan this has many of the great tunes that you will remember. The video and audio quality is 5 star although it is not in DTS 7.1. The lead singer is very good and helps make up for the short comings of Alan Parson's voice. The orchestra is great and the song selection (with the exception of 2 or 3) is also good. This is a concert that I have played several times and will continue to enjoy from my collection.,1471564800,3,432,4.034883720930233
7697515,5,B01D5KI4M2,"For me anything Alan Parsons does is pure magic. From the start sitting behind the control board of Pink Floyds ""Dark Side of The Moon"" to his collaborations with Eric Woolfson. Alan Parsons ranks up there with the likes of Paul McCartney and Jeff Lynne as the greatest composers of the 20th century. Although in most respects I preferred the DVD in Madrid a bit more, what this DVD offered was songs from ""Turn of a Friendly Card"", and that alone made this DVD well worth every cent of the purchase price. Although the only band member still with Parsons from that time frame is PJ Olsson who with Alan Parsons sings most of the songs. With the exception of sax player vocalist Todd Cooper, who sang lead and back up on some songs. Although on lead vocals, I felt his voice was a bit too shrill. Nonetheless, for any APP fan, this DVD is a must have. I would have paid double just for being able to watch and hear the back half, or flip side of ""Turn of a Friendly Card"" which PJ Olsson did a wonderful job on. And as always, so did Alan Parsons. Also as in the case with the Madrid DVD there isn't much given to the production aspect. No big lighting show, just a small stage, set far back from the crowd. But each musician is flawless in reproducing the original sound and guitar licks. For the most part. Camera angles by and large are pretty good. Overall I don't think you'll be disappointed. I sure wasn't.
The song list totals 21 songs.

In order to get any volume I have to crank the volume up at least 10-15 db over all of my other blue ray concerts. The bass is lacking badly. The concert seems to be a good show, but when I buy a concert I want it to sound good. This one is a 4 out of 10 on the audio scale.",1469664000,5,341,3.5

7697526,5,B01D5KI4M2,"Huge fan of APP but was half expecting to be disappointed by the concert given that most of the music is much more complex than traditional pop/rock. However, the orchestra was fantastic and the sound true to the original recordings.  I also loved the selection because they played some of APP's best work even though not always the songs that got airplay... such as the entire second side (for those old enough to recall LP's) of Turn of a Friendly Card.",1469232000,,455,4.617283950617284

The sound quality is excellent in either 5.1 or 2.0. If I get a chance to see them in concert, I will. I gave this a 5 star due to audio quality and number of songs, which is large. The video quality on the blu-ray is lacking. It's good, but there is noise and it's not up to what I have seen on other concert discs I own. Hopefully Mr. Parsons will put out another disc soon of a more current concert and have it specifically optimized for both the video and audio. 4K? I highly recommend this to all Alan Parsons fans.",1468540800,2,669,4.0

7697531,4,B01D5KI4M2,"Short story first.  The only disappointment is that the set list follows along almost exactly with Livespan, with the only significant difference being Silence and I.  Otherwise, great!

Long story.  The Region 0 Blu-ray, as noted by everyone else is playable on US players, no issue at all.  The video quality is very good, though zooms of Parsons seem a little grainy.  The audio quality is great.  I was expecting a larger presence of the orchestra to add onto songs, however, the orchestra is generally used in the original role as on the albums, so people expecting a larger presence will be a little disappointed.  However, when kept in context that the orchestra sections in the songs are being played by a live orchestra, that is very cool!

The set list, while repetitive from the last album, is great and covers the Alan Parsons Project very well.  I wish they'd get some material from Try Anything Once (Jigue or Re-Jigue would have been perfect!) or On Air / Time Machine into these shows.  Those albums have some great tracks.  The vocal harmonies, as with Livespan are incredible.  The musicians play the songs very well.  The leading vocals are great, with Greene, Olloson, and Cooper each adding a different tone for the songs they sing.

For the price, if you are a fan, getting this is a no brainer.",1468368000,2,1317,4.714912280701754
7697532,2,B01D5KI4M2,"Pulling off the kind of perfection accomplished in the studio in a live concert setting would be hard enough with mainstay Alan Parsons Project band members, but with this lineup, there was a lot missing. Ummmm......all the musicians that actually performed these tracks on the LP's for one. Alan Parsons isn't a singer.....he's an audio engineer. Thankfully he only sings a couple of songs. Stuart Elliot's drumming, David Patton's bass and Ian Bairnson's guitar were sorely missed, as these musicians were the backbone of 95% of The Alan Parsons Project. I'm certainly sure Eric Woolfson wouldn't have signed off on this train wreck.(R.I.P.) This was more of a tribute band ensemble than anything else. No offense to anyone that likes the performance. Play it over and over.....but don't be fooled into thinking this is in any way the kind of quality awesomeness of an APP LP. I just wish the original group would have toured so we wouldn't need to endure such a second rate performance.",1467936000,2,989,4.963855421686747

7697535,4,B01D5KI4M2,"This is quite good. I saw them live a few weeks prior to this release, so it's like a souvenir of the show with the bonus of the orchestration. The sound quality is good as are the performances overall. To call this lineup a cover band (earlier review) fronted by Alan is really not fair to the members or their musicianship. We're talking APP music with a wide variety of players over the years. To have a lineup that can do a nice job on some & very good on others is a pretty high bar in itself.
The weakest part truthfully is Alan himself. As most APP fans know, Alan is not a singer nor does he sing lead & rarely sang backup of those albums. I get it that it's his name on the marquee & he's expected to sing for the casual hits-only type of fans. Thankfully it's only sporadic & the other guys do a decent job of capturing the original sound as best they can.
I'll state the obvious (hopefully) & note that this is not a symphony playing with Metallica or Kiss type of thing. Orchestration was a very integral part of the APP sound & some songs like La Sagrada Familia & Silence and I really can't be played without it. Hearing the missing elements during the Friendly Card suite or Damned If I Do & others really allow this music to shine brighter.

The disc as a whole does seem rather cheap. There's no extras at all. Some interview clips or commentary would really have been nice to hear.
Unlike many releases that use Dolby (lossy) Digital for the stereo It's important to note that the stereo track is also DTS-MA & that is a big plus.

It's a bare bones release of a good performance. I'd let price be the deciding factor in this case.",1467763200,,1649,4.248407643312102

7697538,5,B01D5KI4M2,"If I could give this ten stars I would. Excellent audio and as for the video my Blu Ray was perfectly fine. The blending of Alan Parsons Project vocalists with an outstanding group of symphonic personnel was simply sublime. Too many highlights to count and PJ Olsson, who sang lead vocals on some of my favorite tracks, Old & Wise, Time and in particular Silence and I, more than met the benchmark set by his predecessors in the studio versions. While I'll grant you he's not Colin Blunstone (the original vocalist on Old & Wise for example), his vocals were supple, nuanced and completely in-line with expectations. And, everyone in the band seemed to be having a good time, exuding sheer joy in being able to present this outstanding music in such an exotic setting. If, like me you grew up with any of the Alan Parsons Project Music in your life and have always wanted to watch them play this great music live (without benefit of attending an actual concert), then do yourself and those memories a favor, give them a gift, and get them this concert. They'll thank you afterward. I'm sure of it.",1467590400,12,1097,4.6020408163265305
7697539,4,B01D5KI4M2,"Wow.  It looks like I will be one of the few reviewers who has actually watched the disc.  Up front, I will repeat what others have said.  This disc is Region 0, and plays JUST FINE on US DVD & Blu-Ray players. The Amazon product warnings are incorrect.  (Hopefully they are gone when you read this.)

More relevant to a REVIEW of this item, the music is excellent, sound and video quality are both very good.  Camera choices are occasionally questionable (ex., no look at trumpeters during trumpet solos), but also mostly very good.  THE APP had a rotating cast of players, but this is the Alan Parsons LIVE Project now, a different band (except for Parsons), but who have played together for a few years now.  Some of the original band members are no longer with us, primarily the legendary Eric Woolfson, who was the principal songwriter and one of the singers.  (I am disappointed that he is only mentioned in the songwriting credits but never acknowledged or thanked in any other way.)  None of the singers here (except AP) sang on the original recordings.  I like PJ Olsson --  the American singer does a fine job as the current/main lead vocalist.  However, Phil Collins-looking sax player Todd Cooper sings lead on a few songs, and his thin voice is far less satisfying.  The local symphony is marvelous -- no complaints at all with them.  (What a surprising choice of location for this concert video: Medell&iacute;n, Colombia!?! But it looks like a great venue.)  In the end, I really enjoyed this video, although ultimately I still felt like I was watching a very high quality Alan Parsons Project cover band fronted by the man himself.",1467331200,35,1647,4.706293706293707

What I did not like was the way the engineer mixed the audio.  An instrument that should have come out of the right speaker, instead, came out of the right surround speaker.  That kind of nonsense occurred all through the performance.  It was, on occasion, quite distracting.

As a concert video, this just ok, mainly because I don't know any of the players except Alan Parsons who is not particularly captivating to watch on stage.  I think he's more of a concept design engineer guy than a performer and it shows.  Combine that with PJ, who can't be a day over 25 doing some over dramatized singing and cheer-leading (and at least half of the camera shots were in standard definition) and you've got a show that to me, is much better to listen to than watch.  The orchestra was great and the musicianship was very good.  Vocals have never been the hallmark of APP music and that continues here with good but not great singing all around.  This shows somewhat, the difficulty of bringing a concept album music to stage although Pink Floyd was able to to that amazingly well.  Nobody dazzles onstage and that's what makes for a great concert video worth watching....get the cd instead.",1520208000,3,1008,4.5054945054945055
