1688780,5,B0000639HG,"I was in Salt Lake City at the time I saw this movie. Originally, I was going to see Pearl Harbor, the Hollywood extravaganza, but I quickly found out it was sold out. It was only the second day of it's release in the theaters and there was a ton of hype. Unexpectedly, I ended up seeing Brigham City. I never heard of the movie before and but after reading a brief synopsis at the theater I went in. It turns out the movie was quite good. The acting was tremendous, even more astounding  considering the movie used little Hollywood talent other than Wil Brimley. The directing and character development went great together, partly because the leading actor was also the director. He obviously had a vision and passion that must have drove the entire picture. There are subplots and underlying themes throughout the movie that are supported fine acting performances and a good overall story line. What was most interesting for me was although this movie was a drama, it had powerful moments of suspense. If you appreciate such movies that refrain from ""glorified action"" or ""contrived suspense"" then you won't be disappointed with this hometown USA gem. Not sure how many other states have shown this movie other than Utah, as I have never heard of it being released anywhere here in CA, but if you can see it I would highly recommend it.",1007942400,,1338,4.669491525423729
1688781,5,B0000639HG,"Simply the best written mystery I have ever seen.  Without unecessary blood, gore, nudity, profanity, etc., Dutcher manages to keep you on the very edge of your seat throughout the movie.  Unpredictable and exiting!!!!!!!",997228800,4,221,5.470588235294118
1688782,4,B0000639HG,Great flick! Beautifully simple and enjoyable. Was pleasantly surprised by this film. Great acting and direction! Entertaining and intriguing! Thoroughly enjoyed! I will see it again! I inly wish I would have seen it earlier!,994464000,4,225,5.457142857142857
1688783,4,B0000639HG,"""Brigham City"" is a tight, intense, and above all, thought provoking murder mystery.
Forget the wannabe critics like myself, this movie received high praise from many (if not most) of the nation's most revered movie critics. For example: ""The perfomances are impeccable..."" - NY Times / ""...tense, well-spun murder mystery"" - Mr. Showbiz / ""...involving, nicely crafted whodunit"" - Hollywood Reporter / ""...a thoughtful film that deserves a wider audience"" - Chicago Tribune / ""A tight and surprisingly effective murder mystery."" - TV Guide's Movie Guide.
Richard Dutcher successfully broke new ground with God's Army by all but inventing the ""Mormon Film"" genre. Regardless of whether or not you liked God's Army, it's surprise success established Dutcher as a formidable writer/director.
While short of being flawless, ""Brigham City"" continues Dutcher's success streak (allbeit short-lived) to 2 of 2, and more importantly, it raises the bar significantly. This is a better, more ambitious movie than ""God's Army!""
I liked and enjoyed ""God's Army,"" but ""Brigham City"" succeeded on so many more levels. It was truly creepy, intense and most importantly, complex. It dared ask some of life's darkest and most difficult questions. Questions like, Does evil prey upon innocence? and, Why does God allow suffering and tragedy to apparently devastate the lives of good people? Without providing clear answers, viewers are left to contemplate and discuss these questions long after the film is over.
Yes there are religious (Mormon) overtones to this movie. However, this time around, they are less of an infomercial for Mormonism, and more central to the movies more important themes of original innocence, innocence lost, and ultimately forgiveness.
In summary, a majority of the critics can't all be wrong. This is a great movie as well as an original movie. Where else will you see a murder mystery that is capable of spiritually moving you and disturbing you at the same time?",993600000,17,1976,5.276190476190476

1688785,4,B0000639HG,"I really liked this film. It's a small murder mystery set in an apparently 99.9% Mormon fictional small town in Utah. The primary unfolding drama is the story of the small town's sheriff facing up to the sudden presence of a serial killer in their innocent little western oasis where nobody even locks their doors. What I really enjoyed, as both a non-Mormon and a strong believer in mysticism , was the film's humanization of Mormons through the subplot of a small faith-based subculture confronting tragedy and resolving its place in a non-believing world. I enjoyed the tension between the ""outsider"" female FBI agent and the widower sherriff (who is also a Mormon Bishop).
The film has some flaws; but its by-the-book predictable plot devices don't get in the way of it being a deeply affecting film about the place of spirituality in modern life. I recommend it and will probably buy it when it's out on DVD.",989798400,8,913,4.784810126582278

1688821,4,B0000639HG,"For the past decade, I've heard great things about Brigham City, but I've been very hesitant to see it. Aside from having a mostly unknown cast, the film was written, directed, produced, and starred Richard Dutcher, who created a production company called Mormon Cinema, which only makes Mormon related films. I have found that when a film comes from such a strong religious backing, that it usual has a preachy agenda, and tends to focus more on religion than anything else, but to my surprise, Brigham City does not. The film does takes place in a Mormon community, all the characters are Moron, and there is a religious angel to the film, that includes several scenes in the church, which were slow, but thankfully not overwhelming. The story centers around this small religious community in Utah, that is suddenly rocked by a series of murders. Dutcher, plays the sheriff, a highly respect, deeply religious man, grieving for the loss of his family. His town has always been a paradise and has never faced anything like this before, so the sheriff needs to come up with some pretty interesting ways to catch the killer. Dutcher was excellent in his role, after all he wrote it, and who else is better equipped to play such a role? What I really liked was how different the story was, this wasn't just your typical manhunt for a killer on the loose, there were many different facets to this film that made it unique. What gave Brigham City it's fourth star was the amazing twist at the end that no one will see coming. I've seen a lot of films like this and 9 times out of 10, I have the killer pegged before they are revealed, but this film completely blindsided me, which proves to be just another example of how clever it is. Yes, there is some religion and yes much of the cast is unknown, but I found this film to be fascinating. Brigham City had me captivated and on the edge of my seat, but most important of all it made me think and managed to really surprise me.",1361491200,,1974,4.516759776536313
1688822,5,B0000639HG,This murder mystery is thrilling and thought provoking.  There is heartache but the ending scene brings me to pouring down tears (in a good way) every time!  You can really feel the power and love of a ward family.,1301616000,,214,4.461538461538462
1688823,5,B0000639HG,"I have watched this movie several times, and never get tired of it.  It is an unusal story of murder in a quiet peaceful town.  The LDS religion is portrayed acurately without sarcasam.  The acting and scenery are great.  I just don't like the scene where the Sheriff forces his way into a home without a warrant.  Otherwise I would give it a 10/10. Carole",1253750400,,356,4.415384615384616

But suddenly, all his hopes will vanish when he had to del face to face with a serial killer.

Among the several samples of Independent Films, this one maintains an impeccable conceptual honesty and very personal style. Hi camera 's employment with wide objectives reminds us to Howard Hawks and the suspense treatment with the first stage of Alfred Hitchcock. This director even his youth, handled with absolute mastery suspenseful moments, leading us to false assumptions and wrong deductions, building an interesting script, which may be a bit overlong specially at the end.

But the final sum justifies by far, his undeniable talent. Remember this name; for new producers and great audiences. Bravo for him.",1140825600,,903,5.013333333333334
1688828,5,B0000639HG,"""God's Army,"" Richard Dutcher's previous film, remains one of my favorite movies of all time.  ""Brigham City"" is its worthy follow-up, and exceeds it technically.  I love good suspense/mystery films and ""Brigham City"" certainly succeeds on this front. But it is more than this because of the Mormon setting that underpins it. I am not Mormon myself, but appreciate the spiritual worldview which undergirds and deepens Dutcher's films.

What I like about Richard Dutcher's work is how his stories are propelled by a faith which seems an intregal part of his artistic life. To me his films are art; conveying an immersion in life and the human experience through story -- rather than  a story told in order to promote faith.(Although,  truthfully encapsulating one's spirtitual journey/underpinnings is in itself promoting of the

spiritual impulse in others).

 ""God's Army"" and ""Brigham City"" each have one scene that to me encapsulate Dutcher's talent. In ""God's Army"" it was the scene where the greenie missionary spends the night wrestling/praying for a personal spiritual experience  to enable him to continue on his mission. In ""Brigham City' it is the scene at the end where the female FBI agent attends the LDS ward service before heading for home. What is conveyed for me is that while a part of her longs for the community and faith present there, she realizes this is a private moment for those who have spent their lives within that community, and quietly leaves.

In both films the scenes are  subtle, and  gain power because their story is largely implied, without words. This, to me, is the signature of an  artist.",1136592000,6,1629,4.988888888888889

As the sherrif is is morally bound to find the killer, as the Bishop he is morally bound to forget what he knows about people he learns in religious confession. As he comes to grips with these two sides of his life people are dying.

Just read another review of someone who seems to have a chip on his/her shoulder calling this a member recruting film.  I'm pretty sure with one member smoking and hiding it and another running around killing people that it's nothing of the sort :-)

Rent it if you want to know if it's a good movie.  They are normal people struggling like everyone else.  The town folk are on the lookout for a murder in their midst.  Great murder mystery IMO.",1097280000,6,595,4.315315315315315
1688832,4,B0000639HG,"Having just slam-dunk Richard Dutcher's God's Army, I am now moving on to Brigham City which's his second movie. It pretty clear that he must have learned many lessons from his first movie since Brigham City proves to be a highly interesting movie and well crafted one.

Both acting and directing seem to be a major improvement over God's Army and this time around there seem to be a script that works and story that grabbed your interest. This is a LDS movie with a LDS theme but that doesn't interfered with the general story since the theme is reflected more in the characters of movie then the story. The main characters are Mormons and they behaved as such, just the way if the main characters were Catholics, they would behaved as such. The Mormon faith prevailed over the characters but it doesn't clutter the movie.

Personally, I think its the Mormon characters that bring an interesting perception to this serial killer story which otherwise would be relatively humdum in nature thanks to the familiar theme.

As a sheriff of a small town and a religous leader, the lead character, Wes Clayton have responsiblity and power most cops don't have. With such responsiblity and power, and a life at stake, his actions may appears reasonable even if they are technically illegal. (Can Wes be the kindlier gentler Dirty Harry??) As for the complaint the Wes can't walk so he can't be the sheriff, I think when he was injured, he was already a sheriff so he can be remain a sheriff as long as the town wants him.

Not being Mormon, I am not sure exactly all the identification procedures but my bet is, Matthew Brown's character simply slip through the crack. The guilt that Wes felt toward the end was the fact the he screwed up by NOT running Brown's character fingerprint as he was supposed to, which allowed him to slip through the crack, a human error of colossal level but yet forgiving one considering the informal atmosphere of an informal small town where everyone is so laid back.

On the few negative sides, I thought the director's used of his ""red herring"" proves to be very clumsy and heavy handed. I was bit surprised how casual the sheriff was with killer as the latter was assembling his gun. All the sheriff have to do take a single piece to prevent the gun from being operational but he sat there doing nothing but talk. Maybe the proper procedure would have been is wait until Brown's character show up for work the next day and arrest him there with the help from that FBI lady friend.

Intriguing story about crime spree, a human mistake and forgiveness. People shouldn't have any problems with a LDS theme movie no more then they would with a Catholic theme movies. In the end, its the story, script and acting that carries the day. In Brigham City, its a good film.",1096675200,10,2791,4.605633802816901
1688833,1,B0000639HG,"I stumbled upon this DVD at my local video store, mixed in with all the dramas. Little did I know what I was renting. This DVD  spends more time preaching than it does telling a story. As far as I'm concerned, this should've been CLEARLY LABELED as a religious film so unsuspecting agnostics like myself don't waste their hard-earned money on it.
I guess the Mormons have found yet another way to invade my privacy and preach to me. Clever; I'll give them that!
But if they're trying to convert me, this wasn't the way to go about it. It just proved once again how judgemental devout Mormons truly are, and how naive to the real world they tend to be.
As for the movie itself, it was very disappointing; I had a buck-99 coupon on the rental and still feel ripped off. While the plotline is acceptable, the acting is very stilted and none of the characters really come across as believable. To me, the killer was pretty much telegraphed as one of three characters and the ending wasn't much of a surprise because he was one of my three suspects.
I suppose if you're one of the mindless sheep who believe anyone that shares your religious beliefs should be praised no matter how shoddy a job they do, then fine...rate this crapola five stars.
As a movie buff who doesn't give a hoot about religious messages in films, just how good the movie is, this one deserves one star only...and I'm being gracious there.",1078790400,5,1407,4.49609375

It had me going to the end!  Albeit, not everyone will entirely understand the internal working of a small Moromon community but I thought the director gave us a good idea of it!  And lets face it, it doesn't need to be a Mormon town--it's like any small town with its quirks, and dynamics, where everyone wears many hats!  I liked the fact that I recognized no one save Wilford Brimly.  Very refreshing! The sheriff/Bishop is a little low-keyed but hey, he's a widower with a murder on his hands.  All-in-all a great 'indie' movie by director/writer/actor Dutcher--a one-man-show.  I'm buying this one for Christmas!",1069286400,,786,4.63768115942029
1688835,1,B0000639HG,"Too many Mormon viewers are too eager to be pleased by the new crop of B films to hit the LDS market.
I've have grown up in a home where both Mormonism and film were a way of life.  I was excited by the prospect of the two overlapping with Dutcher's release of God's Army (his first dissapointment) and was again let down with Brigham City.  I mean no offense to Dutcher or his team but he needs to research his characters.  Not only is his Sherrif chacracter so inept that he oversteps the bounds of the inalienable rights listed at the VERY BEGINNING of the Constitution, he makes judgements concerning the murderer before he knows anything about the murderer.  Oh wait.  He knows that he's killed some people...  Hmm...
Let's talk about story-telling.  Usually in order to keep an audience's attention you must do something new... Other than the characters being over-trusting, stereotypical, small-town Mormons, there was nothing new done here.  Except for the whole alienating non-Mormons thing... forgot about that one.
As a Mormon who is inherently a little critical I found this film to be so full of holes and lacking in just about every way that I was left feeling insulted.  Is it wrong as an aspiring film-maker to expect the best from people who beat me and my talented friends out for funding? I'm not just an overly-sensitive LDS guy who found Dutcher's use of the Sacrament shocking.  I thought his portrayal of LDS people as inherently blind lemmings was pretty degrading to the image of LDS people as a whole.
Too often we forget that film is an art.  Sure it's been adulterated by Hollywood into a media marketing machine, but is it too much to ask for LDS directors to make films with tact?  You don't need a lot of money to write a script; that's free.
If you must, waste your time, watch this movie and prove me wrong.  I just know that too many people give LDS guys who can't cut it too much credit because their LDS too.",1068768000,7,1944,4.551724137931035

1688847,5,B0000639HG,"When my wife suggested we get 'Brigham City' on DVD I gave her one of my better puzzled looks, and for some reason, before I had a chance to suggest the newly released 'Back To The Future' parts 1, 2 & 3 -- I found myself saying, 'Yes'.  WHY???  I'll never know, but I have found out since that I have been glad that I did.
Richard Dutcher.  Who in the WORLD is Richard Dutcher?  Other than writing, producing, acting AND directing this movie, I'd have to say he's a pretty smart fella.  Is he in a league with some of the grossly overpaid directors working today?  No -- not YET.  As others have gone out of their way to state, 'Brigham City' is a Murder/Mystery set in a small Utah town that lives, eats and breathes as a very strong LDS Community (Mormon).  Some reviewers, who are obviously anti-Mormon, and have a rather slanted version of ANYTHING done by ANYONE who happens to be a member of this religion have taken the low-road and blasted the movie's inclusion of the LDS faith, almost as an additional character in the story.  But for those of us who live in small rural communities, and have an understanding of the LDS beliefs, you realize that a story such as this could NOT be even remotely accurate without the religious additions to the storyline.
With that said, 'Brigham City' is a facinating mystery tale told rather well.  Aside from Wilford Brimley, I recognized absolutely NOBODY...and that turned out to be actually a nice plus to the film.  A well-meaning Brigham City Sherrif stumbles upon a murder, and after first trying to brush it under the local floor mat to preserve the image that small towns simply do NOT have to deal with tragedies such as this, an additional horrific crime scene is discovered.  Before long, the sherrif must come to terms with the frightening realization that a serial murderer is on the loose in this tight knit community.  This forces the Sherrif into overdrive mode and he immediately takes action in ways that would cause almost all lawyers in North America to suffer heart attacks, but in small towns such as Brigham, the end result is not whether or not you violated someones rights in order to save a life, it's whether or not you saved a life -- PERIOD.  Can't say as I blame them.  I'm not too sure I'd be worried about having a search warrant if it meant ending the suffering of someone captured and held with the very real possibility of being murdered.  All that aside, (we could debate it for a very long time, I would imagine) this story is genuinely surprising, especially in unmasking who the real culprit is.  I admit I had him pegged fairly early on, but I waivered several times as the story unfolded, but that certainly didn't stop my overall enjoyment of seeing the plot unwind.
I am going to be recommending this to all my friends who are fans of murder/mysteries.  And once again, for those of you who are stanch anti-Mormon, yes, it'd be a good idea to skip this, but if you can keep your short-sightedness in check for 2 hours, you just might end up learning something about the LDS Church, and enjoy yourself at the same time.  Something that I must admit happened to my wife and I as we sat and watched this engrossing tale.

1688849,1,B0000639HG,"I'm a Mormon. I liked God's Army. I live in small town Utah.
That being said, let me tell you what my thoughts were on Brigham City.
This movie had its heart in the right place, but it couldn't overcome the writer's shortcomings. It's like he wrote this movie with absolutely no research. If I were a small town cop, I'd be offended by this movie.
It portrays small town police as naive and unwilling to get involved with investigations. When they do finally decide to get involved, after two people have been murdered, they do the stupidest things I've ever seen. These are the worst cops ever! We find out early on that the ""sheriff"" couldn't pass a POST exam because first he can't run, second he can't shoot. In the state of Utah, you have to be POST certified to be a sheriff or any type of law officer.
These cops apparently never had POST or any other training. At one point they are responding to a dead body and the sheriff wants to keep it quiet, so the police show up with sirens and lights blaring. Why do they need the sirens on? The person is already dead. Things like this don't bother the cops of Brigham City. They break more rules in the first half of this movie than in all of the Lethal Weapon films combined. Before they investigate, the Aaronic Priesthood holders (for you none-Mormons, it's basically all the boy scout-aged boys) are called up to distribute a police flyer.
Then the investigation begins, but instead of investigating, the police go to a bar, life finger prints off everyone in town who drinks and run them through the FBI computer. How many things are fundamentally wrong with this? Anyway, when that fails, and the body count continues to rise, they call all the Elders and High Priest (for the non-mormons, these are the men of the ward) to do a door-to-door search of the entire town. This leads to a scene where a man's porno collection is found. They arrest him based on his VHS collection and even though they don't have anything to hold him on, they hold him anyway.  They do all this without a warrant. Even if they found the body of the girl they were looking for, it wouldn't matter because they obtained the information illegally, the court would have no choice but the throw out the case and the killer would walk free. But the heroes of our story can't be bothered with details like that.
There is some skill in the making of the film with some really suspenseful moments, but it feels like it was written by an eighth grade English student.  It has a surprise plot twist I guessed early on.
One of the characters tells the sheriff, ""You're a good man."" They should have said, ""You're  a good man, and maybe even a good bishop, but you sir are a really terrible police officer.""
Ultimately, this movie is as dumb as anything Hollywood puts out, but without any of the humor. Not one light, humorous moment. A movie with cops this feeble-minded needs to lighten up and not take itself so seriously!",1051488000,3,2950,4.48975791433892

However, as it unfolded (like a good mystery should), I found myself gravitating to the story, the characters and the true suspense.  In a old-style Hitchcock way, the understand and sometimes non-existent soundtrack gave me no clues as to who the real murderer was.  Really, the only time I remember receiving those audio clues was for the patsy suspected killer and when a murder had occurred.  In the end, I was completely moved by the story, and bought into the characters.  Top that off with it being a clean movie and I would consider adding that to my collection.",1048032000,,753,4.5
1688852,5,B0000639HG,"Brigham City is a real movie lovers movie. Mormon or not. I am NOT a Mormon. NOT that this really matters.
I still found it a stunning work.
This really is a VERY well crafted effort. I was engrossed from the opening scene.
Some people will think it is a merely ""Mormon"" movie designed to further a particular point of standing....Which it is not. The ""Mormonisms"" are merely a backdrop for a well written and enthralling storyline. The story could have just as easily taken place here in Oklahoma deep in the Homeland's Bible belt.
Richard Dutcher could well be one of our best undiscovered actors/directors. He seems totally real and quite comfortable in his own skin.
The main focus point of the film is one in which all people really fear...When the real world comes knocking at your own door...It is most often very unpleasant. Brigham's sheltered quiet lifestyle is shattered by the reality of a serial killer living amongest one of their own. The town learns that suspicion can be an ugly thing. It leads to distrust and changes in one's normal comfortable habitat. A killer could be living next door or EVEN within their own home.
The cast is excellent. Dutcher above all. Finding an actor who brings everyday people to life is slowing becoming a lost art. The camera work is stunning. Soft and peaceful much like the town itself.
There are no big special effects, thumping soundtrack or in your face dogmas. Brigham City is a very quiet work. It does not shout at you. However, it makes one look inward and outward at one's own world, faith and peace of mind.
In the end...It does leave a mark.
Some may find this very unnerving. Life has a way of being just that way.",1045958400,5,1677,4.6120401337792645
1688853,4,B0000639HG,"Having lived in a small mormon community on the I-15 corridor, I was intrigued by how well this film captures the essence of these small towns. I felt that Dutcher's portrayal of the reserved soft-spoken bishop/sheriff was right on the money.
The film captures all the suspense of modern ""blood and guts"" thrillers without indulging in a lot of gore. The violent undertones it generates are highlighted and complimented by a sensitive treatment of the effect the crimes have on the people in this small community.
I felt that the length of the film was appropriate, however, the pacing seemed a little off at times. And, given the length, I would have liked to have seen a little deeper character development--perhaps because I found the characters so intriguing. I also felt that some of the actions taken by Dutcher's character were a shade far-fetched, particularly as the sheriff gets more and more desperate to find the killer.
In spite of its flaws, I would recommend this film to anybody that enjoys a good whodunnit. It will keep you on your toes!",1037836800,,1055,4.834254143646409
1688854,1,B0000639HG,"I was extremely disappointed in Brigham's City, to say it kindly.  The story line was slow, unrealistic, and extremely boring.  We were made to endure almost 3 hours of monotone and expressionless acting, especially from Dutcher's character which constituted  the most unconvincing performance in modern film history.  His character was so poorly acted (and written), that it was difficult to relate to his character. I secretly hoped that he would be the next serial victim.  No comic relief,  little meaningful character development, and monotone and expressionless acting made this film very hard to sit through.
On a technical note I believe the lesson to be learned on this film is to NOT entrust the writing, directing, and principle acting to one single person. Also, the editing could have been much tighter, speeding the progression of the film drastically.  This should have been only a 2 hour film at the most.  I wonder if Mr. Dutcher was the editor too....
Very poor moviemaking across the board! A major disappointment! Very Uninspiring!",1036627200,2,1051,5.141176470588236
1688855,2,B0000639HG,"Personally I found this movie's twist ending rather unsatisfying. With a great thriller, clues are given out along the way, though you may not recognize them until the end (such as in ""The Sixth Sense""). This movie, however, throws out nothing but red herrings, then tries to wrap it up by selecting the least-likely person as the killer. Of course it came as a surprise -- there were no clues. Not great writing in my opinion.
But, the scariest part of this movie was its portrayal of a Mormon church-state and its complete distain for civil liberties. The sheriff is called ""bishop"" more often than ""sheriff."" When he rallies the town's citizens, the sheriff jumps into ""church mode"" and calls upon the church brethren and the Aaronic priesthood boys. The only family to object to an illegal search and seizure is vilified. The town's only bar is coerced into illicitly collecting the fingerprints of all the undesirables (i.e., non-Mormons). Truly frightening stuff!
And I must object to the assertion by others that a knowledge of the LDS culture is not required. Unless the viewer understands the Mormons' view of the implications of ""not partaking of the sacrament,"" the whole emotional impact of the finale is lost. The non-Mormon friends that viewed this movie with me didn't understand what the big deal was.
To its credit, the look and feel of this movie is wonderful. The Wasatch mountains have never looked better, and the town really does ""feel"" like a typical small Utah Mormon community. In addition, it introduces some interesting ideas such as the implications of the loss of innocence. ""Pleasantville"" also dealt with this but with a very different conclusion. Whereas ""Pleasantville"" asserted that change (though difficult and uncomfortable), has a positive effect, ""Brigham City"" concludes that it can do nothing but devastate. A rather pessimistic view, I thought.",1035331200,3,1885,5.083870967741936
1688866,5,B0000639HG,"I'm a Mormon and a huge fan of suspense thrillers and this film was right up my alley, being a murder mystery and a product of Zion Films. In the small Mormon town of Brigham City, Richard Dutcher and his missionary companion, Mathew Brown, from God's Army, return to play companion officers of the law. However, I was so drawn into the movie early on, I never found myself making comparisons to the first film. Probably because I was so wrapped up, not only in the ""who dunnit"" aspect of the film, but Dutcher's flawed yet basically good character and in the moral delemma created by having Dutcher being a bishop of the predominantly Mormon town as well as the sheriff. The Sheriff/Bishop means only well and appears to be the shephard keeping watch over his flock, which makes it harder to watch as he inadvertantly helps the murderer violate the town as he allows prejudice and distrust to mar his investigation. The bishop/sheriff eventually finds the killer but only after he fails in many respects as the town's protector. The story is heart-breaking and edifying at the same time as the bishop discovers his short comings as he attempts to serve the town and allows evil's shadow to be cast over the once innocent town. Yet, by the end, the Gospel become the town's much needed healing salve after the murderer is discovered and the town is again safe from him. I'd caution that this film is appropriately rated PG-13, but it does not have gratuitous violence and doesn't have a single cuss word or sex scene. It's strongly recommended to all.",1034553600,5,1551,4.684981684981685

It shows the struggles of a very religious people and their facing the horror and evil that the worst of our modern day has to offer. At first, they deny that it has touched their town. They insist that it was just a random act of violence that happened on the outskirts of the town. But when the next incident is to one of their own residents, they can no longer deny that evil has come to their sleepy town. And they aren't prepared for it, because they have never had a murder in their town before. So they have to call in the FBI. As one resident says, ""The whole police department was there.""

Wes Clayton (Richard Dutcher) makes for an odd kind of sheriff.  He's a tad portly, with one knee in a full brace.  He's not much of a shot with a handgun and
has never fired at a living thing since a boyhood trauma while out hunting.  He's soft-spoken and somewhat withdrawn since the car accident that killed his
wife and son and left him gimpy.  And he's a Mormon bishop.  Of course, Brigham City isn't your typical police beat.  It's a place where folks leave their doors
unlocked at night and where there's never been a murder.  Or, there had never been a murder, until Clayton and his over-eager young deputy, Terry, find the
body of a young California woman who was driving through town before someone crushed her skull.
Where Terry sees an exciting opportunity to investigate a real crime for once, Clayton only hopes to protect his town from being affected by this contamination
from the outside world, and his initial efforts are mostly directed towards hushing up the murder and getting the FBI to handle the case.  But he recognizes the
risk to the community that this intrusion of evil poses :
  What we got here is a little paradise. And nothing attracts a serpent like a paradise.
And, as other murders are committed, it becomes obvious that the serpent has indeed settled in Brigham City.  In the scene that gave director Richard Dutcher
the idea for the film, the corpse of one victim, a beauty queen, is found under the lovely white gazebo in the town square. Clayton asks Terry : ""You had enough
of the real world yet?""  But must confront the possibility that his own failure to reckon with the possibility of such evil may have contributed to the killer's
cause.
Mr. Dutcher gives a very quiet, soulful performance as a man who's frightened of the violence of the outside world and within his own heart.  His devotion to
his community and his friends and neighbors leads him to strain constitutional bounds in ways that are troubling but understandable, just as his confrontation
with evil forces him to strain the bounds of his own morality, in ways that trouble him but are understandable to us and to the characters around him.  There's
a closing scene based around the communion that is one of the most affecting you'll ever see and while it, and much else here, is sort of religious propaganda, it
is quite effective as drama too.
Make no mistake about it, this is a proselytizing film and it may not appeal to all tastes.  But it is a fascinating glimpse into Mormon culture, a fine though
gimmicky mystery/thriller, and a thoughtful and thought-provoking meditation on the persistence of evil.
GRADE : A-",1026518400,2,2635,4.685466377440347
1688871,3,B0000639HG,"I was quite skeptical coming into this movie, having hated Dutcher's freshman offering, ""God's Army"".  I was therefore pleasantly surprised with the improvement this film showed.  Gone are the bland, formulaic characters and storylines.  This story is edgy, fresh, and insightful.  At times I was worried the plot was about to make a tragic, cliched mistake.  But just as it looked like it was going to fall into so much gummy ""cheese"", the plot twisted and I realized what a skillful, poignant statement Dutcher had woven into the scene.
While the supporting cast is excellent, Dutcher would have done better to have stayed behind the camera, where he is more talented, and to have turned the lead over to a more convincing actor.  The movie's greatest weakness was a generally stilted dialogue which was at best only average.  A few scenes and subplots, notably where the FBI agent expresses her curiosity regarding Mormon doctrines and the ""are they or aren't they"" expressions of romantic tension between the agent and the sheriff, are distract from the story, slow down the movie, and should have been left out.  The music is hauntingly beautiful, but there were a couple of silent moments when I caught myself wondering where it was.  But then its absence at some points serves to make it all the more powerful when it is present.
Overall the plot is very original for the murder mystery genre that has been exploited to the point that this would seem impossible.  While this script will entertain those of any faith, had I not been Mormon, I'm sure I would have missed many of the nuanced references in the storytelling.  It is for this reason that I give it only 3, and not 4, stars.  A film of this type ought to seek to trancend cultures and speak to humanity, rather than resort to ""inside twists"" decipherable only to a few.
All in all, however, I would heartily recommend this film to anyone (except perhaps to young children who may find the movie a little too intense and the storyline a little too hard to follow).  I'm now looking forward to Dutcher's next project, ""The Prophet"".",1023667200,6,2097,4.743801652892562

It reaffirms my faith in filmmaking (especially independent), the ability of the actor-director-writer (the auteuer theory) and humanity. Richard Dutcher acts with the same precision and subtlty that he directs and writes. He is a talent to be reckoned with.

From my own experiences, I know it can be difficult to manage at times the quandary of duty to God and duty to man.  I feel that Mr. Dutcher's film does this dilemma, to make a bad pun, ""justice"".  Mr. Dutcher plays the lead role in the film, Wes Clayton, a sheriff in a small Utah town.  At first, Wes seems like......sort of a dumb redneck.  And I mean that in a good way.  His beliefs almost seem child-like.  However, as the movie progresses, Wes rises to the challenge to find the serial killer who terrorizes the town he is responsible for. Wes is also a Mormon bishop in the town, and so is looked at not just as the local law enforcement leader but as a spiritual leader as well. He handles the situation admireably.
I won't give away the plot; suffice it to say the film comes to a shocking yet satisfying ending.  Also, at the risk of sounding like a prude, mainstream Hollywood directors could learn a lot from Mr. Dutcher's subtle approach to the subject matter.  The film easily gets some unpleasant ideas across without being over the top in violence and sexual subject matter.

The Mormon religion figures highly in this film in a respectful, sympathetic fashion.  I suspect, but of course could not prove, that the film's five-star review run stems from people of the Mormon persuasion who liked what they saw and want to get the word out.  To a non-Mormon such as I, Mormon Brigham City as depicted herein came across as a reasonably benevolent yet rather pervasively suffocating religious city-state.  And they are all so clean-cut!

The sheltered little place is confronted by the harsh realities of the outside world when a serial killer comes to town. The film is ultimately about what happens to faith in the face of the starkest human tragedy. It's been compared to ""Fargo"": comparisons to Peter Weir's ""Witness"" and the stories of Flannery O' Connor would also be appropriate. Some mechanics of the story are a little shaky, but the power of the performances, atmospheric authenticity, characterizations and themes more than make up for it. 2001 was a good year for film noir, with ""Memento"", ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", ""In The Bedroom"", and this movie.

Critically acclaimed by the majority of critics on its theatrical run, it arrives on DVD with a beautiful transfer and an excellent Director Commentary by Dutcher that gives the viewer not only insights into the world of independent filmmaking, but a understanding of why this film is so much more then just a thriller. A NOTE OF INTEREST: There are two different covers for this DVD release -- the one that Dutcher requested and the one that Spartan (the distributor) designed to appeal to video store renters. So don't be alarmed if the cover you see has a large eye glaring at you with a bloody hand reaching out with the catchline: ""Your neighbor is a serial killer. Welcome to your worst nightmare.""

Brigham City is a murder mystery, in which a serial killer suddenly starts eliminating young women in a small Utah town.  The sheriff who must find the killer, is also a Morman bishop.  The job makes demands, that as a man of faith the sheriff would prefer not to confront.
The murders are grisley, but the details are left to the imagination.  The police work portrayed in the story is accurate.  The acting is so fine, the people of Brigham City are real enough to be your neighbors.  The story is interesting and the suspense builds steadily to the aprehension of the murderer.
