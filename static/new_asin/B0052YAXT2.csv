8454814,5,B0052YAXT2,"Wow. Just wow. I watched this film for the first time last night, and can't stop thinking about it. First of all, let's get the ""technical"" details out of the way.

DVD: excellent quality - no issues with sound or picture.

Acting: Astonishingly good. Leonardo Defilippis plays all the parts in this movie (other than some offstage voices), and he actually pulls it off! Very convincing assumption of radically differing roles, sometimes even in direct conversation with each other. A bravura performance.

Music: Near perfection. Never overpowering, distracting, or inappropriate. And always beautiful, occasionally rising to quite moving.

Screenplay: Tight yet sufficient. Enough information to learn about the inspiring life and spirituality of the saint, yet never bogging down in minutiae or irrelevancies.

That out of the way, let's talk about the subject matter of the movie. The world desperately needs to know more about Saint Maxmilian Kolbe, and watching this film would be a good, if not perfect, place to start. The movie deals not only with the life of the saint, but also the forces in the world that made him so vitally important. One simply cannot watch this and remain unaffected. There's just too much emphasis on ""getting even"" in today's terribly unjust world. We could use more people like Kolbe, urging us to pray for our oppressors, to wish them freedom from their own interior darkness, to conquer evil with good, and not just with our own retaliatory evil.

Saint Maxmilian Kolbe also teaches us that martyrdom is a gift from God, and never something to be sought after on our own terms (as do the tragically misguided self-styled ""martyrs"" who kill innocent bystanders along with themselves in their perverted misunderstanding of martyrdom). Kolbe killed no one, but rather saved a life with his heroic sacrifice. The various saints, each in their own way, illuminate some specific truth of the Faith, some ignored or forgotten aspect of Holiness, some path or direction required for one's unique time and circumstances. For our 21st Century, we need to especially learn from three 20th Century Saints - Maxmilian Kolbe, Maria Faustina Kowalsa, and Pope John Paul II. (How odd that they were all Polish.)

A personal confession here: On a 2003 trip to Krakow, I decided to visit the nearby Auschwitz Concentration Camp. On the tour, we stood at the doorway to the very cell in which Kolbe and 9 other persons were murdered in cold blood by the Nazis through two weeks of deliberate starvation and thirst. Today the death cell is occupied by a shrine, startlingly beautiful in its stark simplicity. But sadly, that part of the visit was largely wasted on me. I wish (Oh, how I wish!) I had known at the time who Saint Maxmilian Kolbe was and what his sacrifice meant for us, since I looked at that holy sight with no comprehension of how precious was that place, of how much grace had been poured out upon those stones, of what message those walls held for our sorry world today.

If only I had seen this movie first.",1429833600,2,3045,4.887596899224806
8454815,5,B0052YAXT2,"This movie can change your life! I did not know anything about Saint Maximillian, after I saw this movie, I joined MI, I consecrated  my life to the Immaculata, the music is beautiful.",1384128000,2,184,4.575757575757576
8454816,5,B0052YAXT2,"Polish born Maximilian Kolbe was a Franciscan priest who founded the Immaculate Movement devoted to Jesus' mother, Mary. He used publications to spread this devotion until 1941 when Hitler's goons arrested him and sent him to Auschwitz prison camp.
A prisoner there escaped and the Nazis chose ten men to murder as a warning to the others. Father Kolbe offered to die in the place of a frightened young husband and father and on August 14, 1941, after denying him food and water for two weeks, the Nazis injected him with acid.
In 1982, Pope John Paul II canonized Saint Maximilian Kolbe and declared him ""a martyr of love.""
""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends (John 15:13).""",1364428800,2,721,4.640625
8454817,5,B0052YAXT2,"Knowing that this movie was performed by only one actor doesn't make it a dud! I was skeptical at first, but after having seen it, it was amazing! I thought that first of all, the plot (based on true story) is very moving, engaging, inspiring and makes one think about many things that we may not think of normally. Secondly, the performance was really not at all distracting, but very well talented, making you actually watch the film as a real movie and not like a play.

I give it two-thumbs up!!",1358035200,,499,4.423913043478261
8454818,3,B0052YAXT2,"Happy with the vender who was speedy and accurate - received before time and was pleased.
Maximilian, Saint of Auschwitz performed by Leonardo Defilippis was disappointing.  Maximilian Kolbe was a fine individual and written in the third person with film shots toooooo close to the face for much of the film was to much for me.  I had to listen only to most of the film.  The sole perfomance by this actor was disconcerting.  toward the end of the movie it finally had my viewing interest.  Would not recommend buyin dvd but perhaps a rental.
Perhaps these details should have been included in the description paragraph before buying.",1356393600,,634,4.833333333333333
8454819,5,B0052YAXT2,i am hoping that the listed price is a misprint!!  a $15-$20 dvd (purchased elsewhere online) selling for $70.00 is no deal in my opinion!!,1345248000,,139,4.56
8454820,5,B0052YAXT2,"I did not purchase this DVD through Amazon. The DVD was available at the Saint Luke Productions online store website. I am a fan of Leonardo Defilippis. I Googled him and found his DVD on that website for fifteen dollars. I found the story compelling. But I remain unsure if this DVD for sale on Amazon is the same one. What I can say is the DVD ""MAXIMILIAN: SAINT OF AUSCHWITZ"" is deeply moving and worthy of this fine actor and director.",1333238400,,439,4.365853658536586
