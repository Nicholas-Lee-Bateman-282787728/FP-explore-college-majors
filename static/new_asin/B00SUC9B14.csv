8699326,2,B00SUC9B14,"Didn't hate it but didn't particularly like it either. This was somebodies acid trip brought to life and they should not have done it. There was no plot, what they called special effects I laugh at, and the acting was just not worthy of being described. I made it through only because I was reading and wanted the background noise because I could not get into it at all. Beware!",1492300800,,378,4.414285714285715

8699328,1,B00SUC9B14,"this flick; which is ""inspired"" by ""Room 1408"" (with John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson) is the absolute pits.
not exactly what one would describe as a ""brainchild"" (in the good sense).",1485388800,2,184,4.78125

8699330,1,B00SUC9B14,"Bad acting, visuals made the film almost unwatchable, and the main character was such an annoying idiot I found myself hoping he would be killed. He is admonished by the building's owner NOT to lose his keys, so what does he promptly do? You guessed it: He loses his keys. It's one of those movies where half of which is seen through an iPhone, making it very difficult to watch, and half through a spectator's eyes. In trying to be artistic, the film ended up using cheap, flashing video effects, a bit like those strobe lights at junior high school parties in some kid's garage. I couldn't watch past the mid-point, and even then, I kept fast-forwarding in my search for something to happen besides the main character examining piles of junk in rooms he'd never visited while looking for his keys and very, very slowly being haunted by a young girl who probably didn't like him any better than I did. I would say avoid this one.",1483488000,2,930,4.541666666666667
