6516939,5,B00LZBUGDE,"I found both series to be the funniest TV I've experienced since Louie (on FX). The team of Coogan and Brydon will be remembered with the great comedy duos of all-time.

WARNING, their humor is not for everyone; if your preference of comedy sitcom is mainstream American (ie. Two and a Half Men, Big Bang Theory: formulaic, situational comedy with laugh track) than you are likely to be disappointed.",1413936000,2,400,4.797101449275362

6516941,5,B00LZBUGDE,"Very original comedy. Part 1 is better than part 2 (in my opinion), but I enjoyed both!",1411948800,2,87,4.176470588235294
8669161,3,B00LZBUGDE,Interesting scenic with two man on a trip and at the same time trying different food at different restaurants.,1519257600,,110,4.842105263157895

8669163,5,B00LZBUGDE,Absolutely brilliant and hilarious!,1510790400,,35,8.0
8669164,5,B00LZBUGDE,"Surprising how fascinating these films are considering there is essentially no plot other than ""two guys driving around trying out fancy restaurants"".",1503964800,,150,5.863636363636363
8669165,2,B00LZBUGDE,"These videos have been a serious disappointment; they depict two middle-age men, sometime actors, who are extremely narcissistic, engaging in a battle of bad impressions, wherever they go. Thinking the trip to Italy might be different, I watched part of it only to find it was a repeat of the trip to Northern England. They continued to do the same bad impressions. This only added insult to injury as there was virtually nothing about the food or the scenery of whatever location they might be in. Only these two dudes sitting at a table in an obviously expensive restaurant swapping their bad impressions, or trying to score with restaurant or hotel employees. Save your money; Rick Steves is actually funnier, and he shows you the places and tells you interesting things about them.",1502841600,,785,4.909774436090226
8669166,5,B00LZBUGDE,Great DVD-A+++++,1484179200,,16,7.5
8669167,5,B00LZBUGDE,"Incredibly clever and witty while still being first rate travelogue. I've actually located a couple of the Italian restaurants and used they're trip as a gastro-guide to eating my way through Italy. While ""The Trip To Italy"" is the more scenic of the two films, ""The Trip"" is funnier. For anyone wanting s belly laugh or two I'd recommend they watch ""The Trip"". Both are superb!",1472256000,3,378,4.742424242424242
8669168,5,B00LZBUGDE,"Some very good humor here, not labored, but intrinsic to the story. Good writing; good acting; most enjoyable.",1463616000,2,110,5.166666666666667
