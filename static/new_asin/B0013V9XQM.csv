You will never regret that decision. The Baji dvd is well done. Having been exposed to Pigua/Baji in my youth, this is very well done. It filled in a few gaps from my previous training. Multiple angles. The demonstrations are on par as a supplement to training as it should be. If you have Northern Shaolin experience, you can learn the basic from disk. You will still need a Sifu for tweeking and fine tuning. But you will have a very solid showing of the material",1438819200,,624,4.681818181818182
8253142,4,B0013V9XQM,"This is my first actual introduction to baji quan and i must say it was pretty good.  All the basics are covered, stepping, stamping, basic hand techniques, an empty hand form and some internal and post training.

The only issue i have with this product is that there is no voice over explaining each action.  Since i have been doing martial arts for almost 10 years, I figured out how the power issuing works.  But to a beginner who cant see the movments of the waist (the demonstrater wears all black making it difficult to see) they won't figure out how to generate alot of power.

All in all its a great product and I plan to purchase the second volume.",1366329600,4,657,4.396694214876033
