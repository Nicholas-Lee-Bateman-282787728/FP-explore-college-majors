8287594,4,B001CFQO2A,"Jun Sakurada is a troubled middle school student. While his parents are away on a business trip, he and his sister Nori are alone at home. Jun decides to drop out of school for personal reasons. Now, he spends his days at home in his room surfing the Internet and purchasing merchandise from various websites. One of his packages ends up being a beautiful doll but he doesn't remember ordering one.

After removing her from the suitcase, Jun winds the doll up and she suddenly comes to life. The doll reveals herself as Shinku, The Fifth Rozen Maiden Doll. Jun is forced to make a bond and become her medium through a ring called the Rosa Mystica. He soon finds himself having to deal with his own demons, plus help Shinku survive a life or death game with her dueling kind called, ""The Alice Game"".-summary

Without a doubt this is a series that is not for all taste. I'll make it known right now. If your anime must be of the same breed as Ninja Scroll, Godannar, Burst Angel, or even Ghost in the Shell. Then there is nothing here for you because Rozen Maiden is not a very dark or heavily action driven show in the first place. I will say it more than resembles and blends Angelic Layer and Azumanga Daioh. This is due to its style concerning cute characters, fighting dolls, some drama, and over the top comedy. There are action scenes present but this is clearly not the selling point.

At its core, Rozen Maiden is mainly character driven. Several more dolls soon appear with each having their own distinct personality. There are plenty of characters with each of them given a good amount of time to develop. The character development is very strong by giving viewers a chance to choose which character can be a favorite. This is done through the exceptional writing, which provides the characters with very real and down to earth emotions. To include, the great voice work for both languages brings out their appeal.

There happens to be two plots taking place during a stand alone episodic format. This is actually where one of my cons concerning pacing issues will be addressed. One of the plots takes place with the origin and purpose of ""The Alice Game"". This game is a one on one battle between each of the dolls for their Rosa Mystica. The loser will become a regular doll, therefore, being robbed of all life. The victor will come closer to becoming ""Alice"", which happens to be the perfect being in order to meet their ""father"".

The lead villain named Suigintou is determined to win the game by any means necessary. Her first conflict with the other dolls will grasp the attention of the action fan. This plot may seem to be dropped, but it's woven together with some of the stand alone episodes as well as the secondary plot. The secondary plot deals with the dolls helping Jun break away from his solitude. This is where I believe serious action oriented fans may either hate this series, or not really care for it because the minor pacing issue can have a negative effect; but if the viewer prefers character driven stories and is already sold on the characters, especially after the over the top comedic episode five. Then getting through the rest of the series will be easy since it really does end strong in my view.

Rozen Maiden does touch on certain themes. I also feel they're tied up pretty well. Several questions are answered but not fully, and they're only answered to the point where they make sense but also adds to the mystery. All depending on the viewers taste concerning Japanese comedy. The comedy can be hilarious or annoying. I found a majority of it to hit the right mark. Most notably for me in the dialogue. Some of the characters use very mild foul language, but I don't consider it to be real potty mouth.

The character designs are gorgeous for each of the dolls, even for the dark character of Suigintou with the colors of their dresses displaying their personalities to some degree. I also liked the backgrounds and artwork for Suigintou's dark dimension which is littered with destroyed toys. However, it is inconsistent because sometimes the dolls appear to be a different height which happens to be very noticeable. The animation overall is very clean and fluid during the battles. This also goes for small details such as facial and eye movments. The soundtrack has a nice melody that accurately captures the moment each time with some nice violin pieces. The standout song for me is by far the ending theme called Tuomei Shelter.

This first season ends on a strong note, and in the process almost makes the second season Rozen Maiden: Traumend a must see if you're already sold on the characters. Unfortunately, the second season isn't as strong as its predecessor.

Pros: Character development & good interactions, beautiful character designs

Cons: Inconsistent animation, comedy and style will not appeal to everyone, minor pacing issues",1427587200,,4894,4.713450292397661

Nothing to say on the anime itself, since if you're buying this you either already know what you're in for or if you don't, you're better off reading a dedicated review or checking out a few episodes online.",1362528000,,303,4.527272727272727
8287596,5,B001CFQO2A,"Rozen maiden is a anime series that not only brings epic action, but comedy and wonderful memorable charaters. Jun, who is a gifted child, got embarrased at school so badly that he forced himself to stay home, in his room. His hobbies were to buy Supernatural objects, look at them, and return them before the 30 day warranty ends. One day he recieved a letter saying will he do it or not. He circles the he will do it part of the note and stuffs it away. Suddenly, a weird suitcase appears in his room, when opened, it is revealed to be a doll. There is a key crank right next to the doll and when he cranked the doll up, it became alive. No, i mean, like a human being-alive. The doll's name is Shinku, and is a Rozen maiden doll. There were only 7 made in the whole world. Jum was forced to become her Servant due to him about to be killed by a clown toy (Don't ask.) and here's where the adventure begins. they find 5 dolls, and for the last two, one is the evil charater in the first season, and the second one is unknown. The show is hilarious when the first 2 dolls join them (Hinaichigo & Suiseiseki) and continues to keep the drama and action it has. The music is absolutely awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a great series and you should buy it if you want to experience a great story.",1240272000,7,1314,4.13671875
8287597,5,B001CFQO2A,"Let me first say that I was somewhat hesitant to buy Rozen Maiden. Nearly the last thing I wanted to do was buy was another semi pedofeelic anime (if that's a word). Fortunate while the dolls are only about the size of your typical porclin doll the main hero is only in 7th grade. Also the doll is actually the most mature of all the characters so I don't feel like a pedofile watching it and cheering them on.

Now to the actual review. First I'll start off wit hthe good which for a change there is a surprising amount of. First off I feel the need to mention the character designs. For a 13 episode series Rozen Maiden developes  each character quite a bit and each are reconigizable not just by their apparance but by their mannerisms and actions. Theres is also a good balance of seriousness and comedy making cure that the sries never gets depressing or overly silly. The music is a delite and while not the best I've ever heard it is one of the best used. The animation, as I've com to expect from Rando Robe, was excellent movements were fluid and crisp. The stills though few were also well done. as a note I want to bring up how well the character designs were again. By the end of the series when th villan finally falls, the develpoement is as such that you actually understand her and fell sorry for her.

Now to the bad parts. Yes unfortunately the series does have a few negatives in the corner. First and formost is th kind of glass over of the plot. This isn't a great detraction as the series focuses more on characters but it is there. I wanted to know more about what was going on. Then again with a plot as relatively simple as this once maybe it was good thing the plot was not more enfusized. The second is the lack of a real ending. While most of the subplots are wrapped up nicely, th villans dead, the hero over comes his obsticales however the cause of the problems for the dolls still exist. The Alice games are not over yet, 'father' has not appeared, and what exactly if alice beyond the perfect girl is not clear either. There are also a number of questions that are braught up at the ned of the series that are never fully answered. I'm hoping this means there will be a second season sometime. If not well, then the ending while not bad does leave lose ends.

In the end I have to say tht Rozen Maiden is an excellent series and well worth purchasing. Though I would recommend waiting until you can buy it for around 30$ as I find 50$ for a 13 episode series a tad o nthe expensive side, even if it is brand new.

Lastly I will review the actual box set. Ths cases themselves are the thinpack veraity, which isn't bad I've grown to prefer these. The covers are reversable and the dvds are completely untouched and intact, unlike with some companies. Yeah I'm staring at you ADV scruppers. As for the box itself, it's kind of flimzy and bare paint so I wouldn't recommened keeping the dvds in it while they site o nthe shelf as it will get scuffed up rather easily.",1231027200,10,2997,4.297345132743363
8287598,5,B001CFQO2A,"You can't go wrong. Rozen Maiden is an amazing series, and home to my favorite fictional character of all time: Suigintou.
As with all anime, there is a controversy among fans between subs and dubs.
I for one don't care. However, the only problem I had with this one was the dubbing AND subbing for Suiseiseki.
They did a great job of translating ""desu"" into ""so"" and ""such"" as best they could.
(ie: ""That so hurt!"").
But they needed MORE of it, in either dub and/or sub, to fully capture this trademark quirk of Suiseiseki that has made her infamous throughout the Internet.
I would say that this is the only flaw I could find with it, so I'll still give it 5 stars.",1223683200,6,667,4.387096774193548
