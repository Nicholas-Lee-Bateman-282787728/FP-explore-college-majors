6578575,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"I love that this workout doesn't have any really complicated moves or choreography, but does give you a good workout.  I did this workout yesterday morning.  During the workout my hips and arms hurt a little, (not like I was doing something wrong, but more like I was actually doing something with muscles I generally avoid), but I was a little afraid I wasn't getting the intensity I needed since I wasn't sweating much and my heart rate wasn't through the roof.  Anyway, by the time I went to bed I could really feel it in my shoulders.

I know some people have complained about the ladies in the back not having a very happy personality.  That really didn't bother me.  I mean it was obvious that they were people like me who needed to pay attention and put effort into the workout.  I don't necessarily need or want chipper rail thin people smiling at me while I am huffing and puffing just trying to keep up.

I applaud Debby Mack and the ladies working out with her for providing a realistic workout for those of us with a lot to lose.",1424649600,76,1041,4.385416666666667
6578576,5,B00MHS5FMQ,FUN and EASY! True to description. Low impact and designed for plus size people. Debby gives great instruction and she made it easy to stay with the program. Plus the 30 minute time frame is very convient. Started doing this workout 3 times a week along with daily walks and already seeing results and feeling toned and fit! I'll be purchashing her other dvd's soon.,1421366400,2,366,4.6461538461538465
6578577,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"Don't let the ""Back 2 Basics"" title fool you. You're going to get a good workout with this, especially if you've been a couch potato for a while, like I have. I have several workout DVDs but haven't used them (I know, shame on me) so I got this one thinking it would be a nice way to ease back in. What a surprise! And not just with the cardio. I had no idea how out of shape my arms had gotten...spending time on the computer and other technologic non-arm activities. Well worth the purchase.",1417564800,29,493,4.2

6578579,3,B00MHS5FMQ,"Started this new video low-impact exercise routine today, for indoor exercise when outside is just too bloody HOT! (Current temp is 94F, expected high of 110F!) Being I'm badly out of shape, I got about 10 minutes before the low-impact aerobics got me winded, so I will do another 10, and another, with rests, until I get through this.

So far, the exercises are ok, simple, and helpful, with plenty of time to transition to the next step. But the dancer trained inner me is screaming that the instructor is clearly offbeat with the music I have to listen to. Someone in sound editing clearly has no clue on dance rhythm, so their steps are just a hair off. So I'm just getting cues from her as to what to do, closing my eyes, and moving to the technobeat (gag) I'm hearing. I'd rather have different music, too.

I'll keep the video, as this looks like it will give me a good workout, which I need. But I'm not happy with the off timing.",1503878400,3,938,4.385057471264368

6578581,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"I am loving working out with this DVD. It is a challenge for me still, but the instructions and moves are do-able for even my creaky bones. My goal is to get in better shape and not need it anymore, but for now...I am sweating to the Basics.",1498694400,2,241,4.041666666666667
6578582,5,B00MHS5FMQ,Great DVDs for those starting out or with physical limitations. Easy to follow along. A was sweating and my heart was beaten nag fast by the end. I currently have frozen shoulder so towel toning is really helpful even if I have to modify it. I borrowed this from library to try it before I buy it. Can't wait for it to arrive.,1496448000,,326,4.190476190476191
6578583,5,B00MHS5FMQ,Today was my first time doing this workout. I bought it because of the positive reviews it generated. I wanted a workout for plus size people by plus sized people. This DVD did not disappoint. Debby keeps the choreography simple but effective. The workout did what I needed it to do. Make me sweat and use my muscles. I love it. Some people have said they didn't like the DVD because 2 of the women weren't smiling. That doesn't bother me a bit. They both kicked my butt when it came to energy. The blonde was hopping into her kicks while here I am trying to find the energy to keep going. I wasn't smiling either. This DVD truly made me realize how out of shape I am.  I plan to keep using this DVD and buy Debby's other products. I highly recommend them to anyone.,1496016000,4,766,4.2465753424657535
6578584,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"This is a great video. Has real sized people. The workout is a good beginner workout. The people in the back do not look happy, but id rather have sweaty, red faced people to look at then supper peppy, not even sweating people.",1491955200,3,227,4.3023255813953485
6578585,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"So far I like it!! I'm glad I bought it!
I'm just getting back into working out after being at a desk job for a while. I am 5'5"" and over 200 lbs. I haven't done any regular working out with weights or cardio for a few years. This video is perfect to start out on. I just did the first 30 min and am sweating. I am not a coordinated person. So far the moves aren't difficult to follow. The lady doesn't yell at you but just gives you just enough encouragement when you start into a higher intensity parts. In my opinion there isn't much of a warm up at the beginning but she doesn't start off with anything too intense.
It was nice to follow someone close to my size and not someone super skinny.
Overall great to start out with if you are just starting up working out after a sedentary lifestyle.",1490659200,11,797,4.115384615384615
6578586,4,B00MHS5FMQ,"I think it is a great dvd , especially for someone a bit out of shape starting into a routine.  I get a pretty good workout that I am actually able to complete . I want to do it again instead of feeling like it was overwhelming.",1490054400,2,228,3.851063829787234

6578588,2,B00MHS5FMQ,I was very disappointed in this book. The quiz was fun to take but the food suggestions/diet plans are disappointing. I was hoping for more.,1488844800,,140,4.64

6578590,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"My knees aren't the greatest so I appreciate the no jumping aspect of this workout. However, that does not mean you don't get a good workout because you do. Great for someone who is just starting out. It's also good to see real women with real bodies. It makes it much less intimidating.",1485993600,5,287,4.433962264150943
6578591,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"Although this DVD appears as my daughters purchase it was actually for me, her 190 lb, 5""2"" 70 year old mom. This is the greatest DVD exercise tape I have ever had and I have a number of them. Debbie makes this exercise program easy and available to plus size and  healthy seniors. Please do not hesitate to buy because I am a senior writing this review, this is a great exercise program for starters and re-starters at  any age.",1485907200,4,429,4.35
6578592,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"The steps are very easy to follow, however, you do get a good workout.  I had not done aerobics for awhile, but I was able to learn the routines in no time.",1482796800,,156,3.875

6578594,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"I did this workout yesterday for the first time and made it all the way through the workout. That really surprised me, of course, I had to march in place several times to catch my breath and messed up on some steps, but I made it all the way through!  Also, I'm not hurting this morning so far, usually after other dvds I have had to skip 2 or 3 days because of pain before I'm able to do them again.  I'm 69, about 100 lbs overweight and have artificial knees and have trouble with complicated routines.  These were all steps that I can follow, even though it's hard for me right now. I like the plus sized people in the workout, it makes me feel that I can do this too.  I have ordered her walking dvd and plan to get her kickboxing dvd later when I'm in a little better shape.  It is great to find a workout dvd that I can do, most of them are full of extremely fit people who don't have any trouble with complicated, fast routines and I get frustrated when I can't keep up.  I want to get in better shape and have finally found a workout, that I can do, that will help me do that!",1480809600,10,1084,4.018604651162791

6578596,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"I purchased this and the Cardio Kick as well. I have a good 100lbs to lose and was looking for something easier I can follow, yet still get a good sweat going. I have some other higher intensity workout DVDs but I was getting so winded early on that it was a struggle to keep going and I would get discouraged. Since I'm just getting back into exercising, I was happy I came across this on Amazon! At first I thought it might be too easy, but when I was a few minutes in I could did feel the sweat and burn!",1470873600,4,507,3.980392156862745
6578597,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"Do not let this Basic workout fool you!  You WILL feel the burn!  I usually do not do workout videos because I have such bad knees that I have to modify the movements too much and too often, that what is the point.  I usually just stick to my treadclimber, walk, or some yoga.  I saw this video and thought...Oh what the heck, I'll try it.  I am so glad I did.

This video is super easy to follow but you will get a workout!  The movements are basic and Debby goes through transitions slow and easy so you do not fumble and miss the rhythm.  Your hips and thighs will burn towards the end :-)  I only had to modify 1 exercise (squats) to accommodate my knees.  This was a pleasant surprise!  Then she does an upper body workout using just a towel!  She says you wouldn't think a towel would do much but it does..I aggree!!!  My arms are so tired that typing is a little bit of a chore.  This is a good thing!  I can see that this would become redundant and boring after a bit of time, but for now...it is great!!!

SO:  If you have bad knees, ankles, or back this is the video for you.  You will sweat and burn but will not hurt!
If you are just getting back into working out, this is the video for you!",1466899200,55,1203,4.02542372881356

6578602,1,B00MHS5FMQ,"I couldn't concentrate enough on the workout since I'm pretty sure the two women in the background had knives to their backs to force them to do this video.  Judging by their miserable, dour expressions through the entire thing, this is a case of kidnapping for the purposes of making a video.  Seriously, even the one LEADING the exercises looked like she was being forced - or at least blackmailed - to do it.  Not that everyone has to look ridiculously cheerful when working out, but how am I supposed to get motivated by people with the personalities of wooden spoons?",1460851200,4,572,4.643564356435643

6578605,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"Easy to use, just pop it in and hit play. And she's good. The first few times she kicked my butt. I couldn't do the whole thing. But after the 5th time. I'm doing much better.

6578608,5,B00MHS5FMQ,I truly enjoyed this workout it's really great for someone who has never worked out before. I think this is a great DVD for a person who is plus size and who is looking to get healthy you will definitely enjoy this,1451865600,3,214,4.119047619047619
6578609,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"I'm a big Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds fan, but this has become my favorite morning workout. So refreshing for me to be working out with ""women that look like me."" Made me realize how subliminally de-motivating most videos are because they only feature thin men and women;some of us will never be thin no matter how hard we work out. The video eases my body into moving in the mornings but leads to some really intense segments of kicks and knee lifts. I've noticed a lot more muscle in my quads since I've been doing this video. It's not a great quality video but I get a great workout from it. The main workout is about 30 minutes after which the instructor moves into a 10 minute segment of towel toning--and it's truly ""harder than it looks,"" as she says (especially the arm exercises). The instructor has a friendly demeanor but isn't high energy or as encouraging throughout the workout as instructors on other workout videos I have.",1450828800,5,946,4.570588235294117
6578610,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"This is a great low-impact cardio workout, especially for people beginning exercise after a prolonged sedentary life.

I always go further each time.",1447632000,5,299,4.4

6578612,4,B00MHS5FMQ,"Good DVD for beginners or post-injury re-entry.  I purchased this with Mack's kickboxing DVD.  The later is more intense, but both offer a daily get going workout.  I am post injury and cannot tolerate jumping or extremes on my feet or knees and both DVDs are low impact enough to accommodate me.  If modifications are needed they are easy to figure out.  One can up the intensity, as well.
Instructions are easy to follow and announced well before the movement.

I alternate daily between the two and, also, use Joyce Vedral's weights and toning, upper and lower body DVD, as a supplement.",1438387200,5,590,4.735294117647059
6578613,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"This video is exactly what I needed. I was able to get through the video on the first try without stopping and the sweat is surely flowing. It is challenging enough to ensure that results will be achieved with consistency but not so tough that you no longer want to press the play button. I should mention that while I did complete the 30 min aerobic exercise segment. I didn't have enough in me to finish the toning. For now my plan is to alternate toning and aerobic exercise.

Background: I am a 288 lb mother who has lost and gained hundred of lbs over the years. I have alternated between a go hard exercise enthusiast doing up to 5 hours a day and being so lazy that I send my children to get the remote when I would like to change the channel.",1436486400,31,750,4.208333333333333

If you need a low impact workout, you follow one of her people in the back, who does modified steps, and the other one does moves with a little more energy. I've seen reviews where people comment on the women not smiling, but let's be honest, this is more of a real workout video than the people who cake on makeup and don't sweat through an hour long video.

8672416,5,B00MHS5FMQ,This workout totally kicked my ass at the end. The toning portion with the towel was awesome and quite difficult if you are out of shape. Definitely loving this video!!

8672417,5,B00MHS5FMQ,"I've been doing Leslie Sansone and Jessica Smith videos for a while now but was looking for some new videos with different instructors to add to my video library.  I picked this one based on the reviews.  It is low impact and not as fast paced as other workout videos I have.  I did not get as winded as I have with other videos  but I did break a good sweat by the end.  The steps are not too hard if you've done other low impact exercise videos: kicks, knee lifts, side steps, lunges, out,out/in,in steps.  There is a segment that did get my legs aching a bit: a set of travelling knee lifts that switches to travelling kicks that switches to travelling taps. there was also one set of ""football running"" which I hate, but it wasn't very long as well as a set of side to side lunges that turn to side to side double lunges.
Debby's queing was spot on and she was very pleasant, supportive and not as ""chatty"" as some other exercise video instructors. :D
The music was a little spotty in places but it didn't really mess me up.  I just watched Debby's feet.  As far as the two ladies walking with Debby, another reviewer said they annoyed her.  I have always thought it odd that people in workout videos have to smile the entire time.  but, I do have to say I wished those ladies would have cracked a smile once in a while.  They looked liked they were about to die by the end of the workout.  I actually got a kick out of watching them, especially the lady on the right.  I feel your pain, girl!
