3923846,4,B002FOQXXM,"Heat Guy J is one damn fine show. At first, the story comes off as something of a cliche (a pair of investigators try to stop a Mafia crime boss and other villians) but further into the series, excellent twists take place and intrigue buildup turns it into an addicting watch. On top of that, Action scenes are smooth and plentiful and NEVER use still images, the music good with an extremely cool bagpipe-rock track for the action scenes, and the main villian Clair Leonelli is a very unpredictable character.

As far as bad qualities go, the show used too much 3D CGI. I am very put off by CGI because it never looks nearly as cool and it never fits well with the regular animation.",1272412800,2,684,4.428571428571429
3923847,5,B002FOQXXM,"I use to watch it sometime back when it came on MTV and I must say it's good to see all the episodes dubbed.
Everything in this series is perfect and it's not like the crap anime that Japan dishes out now and days.
Heat Guy J is a classic and I'm surprised that it's not at ""Legend"" status yet like other anime series.
It's well worth the cost, and if your a fan of anime and especially sci-fi anime then this boxset is for you.",1271030400,3,428,3.988372093023256
3923848,4,B002FOQXXM,"Heat Guy J is one of those properties I've encountered in my travels but always seemed to disregard in favor of titles that were hotter, cheaper, or just better promoted.  The idea of a law enforcing android sounded interesting enough to this self-proclaimed mecha fan boy, but until now the show has managed to fly below my proverbial radar.  Let me just say that after completing the show tonight, I shouldn't have waited so long to get involved! But before I get ahead of myself, let's take a look at the cold hard facts, shall we?

Heat Guy J The Complete Series comes in at a runtime of 650 minutes and contains 26 episodes spanning four discs. The DVDs come packaged in a pair of thin packs within a simple but effectively decorated cardboard outer slipcase.

The show wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to some slightly adult slanted themes of violence, criminal activity and just general conflict. There is no nudity or rough language to worry about.

Speaking of, language options are typical sub and dub, which means the viewer has the choice of running either the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub (either of which are in stereo) and the option of displaying English subtitles beneath either dialog choice.

Extras include an interview with the show's creator and a crop of upcoming Funimation anime previews.

The story, which is nice and gritty in its presentation, goes like this: The unlikely duo of young loose cannon cop Daisuke ""Dice"" and steam powered android J are the (fictional) city of Judoh's last line of defense against a whole host of criminal bad guys which include feuding mobs, illegal immigrants, and androids sent in from other districts.

The plot structure of each show is a bit formulaic but this isn't to be mistaken for simplicity.  In truth there is an undeniable ""cool factor"" associated with the title character even if you aren't impressed with his gray-hair, pony-tailed persona upon first glance.  To begin with the art work/ animation segments designed to show the world through J's eyes is very good stuff.  His calm and business-like demeanor is offset by swiftness and precision once the scene turns ugly (and it will, take my word for it).  In all the dynamic between the two lead characters works really well and lends some genuine humor to the formula.  Dice is kind of reminiscent of a cross between Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers and Crockett (Don Johnson) on Miami Vice while J is equal parts Robocop and Steven Seagal.

Sure the story arcs are merely glorified retellings of the ""two underdogs against the entire criminal underworld"" scenario, the show's production team wisely created an antagonist interesting (and challenging) enough to make for some really slick episodes.  The bad guys in Judoh are mob families, the likes of which could almost work in a show like The Sopranos.  I say ""almost"" because a perfect fit would demand more violence and cussing than you're going to find here but the politics, motivations, and friction between gangsters is both well developed and intriguing.

Pacing is nice and fast with very few episodes (even in the middle) that find themselves bogged down with unimportant details or story thread tangents.  Rare but certainly welcomed for a 26-episode run.

The artwork is gritty and moody just like a criminally infested city should be.  Nobuteru Yuuki's character designs are both simplistic and alarmingly complex through their mannerisms and fluid animation.  A few of the CG elements don't mesh quite as well as they could have with the dark background work but in all the art is easily on par with the remaining production value (which is to say well done).

Voice work, as has been the case with Funimation's sets of late, is equally powerful in either language option.  The Japanese track offers a bit more emotion but the English harkens to many personas (bad guys especially) right out of American pop-culture.  Truly one of few properties that can be called equally enjoyable in either language (which of course is the polite way of suggesting you watch it in both).

Conclusion: Slickly developed lead characters, plots involving believably criminal minds, intense action sequences and spectacular voice acting all add to a highly recommended package.  Crisp visuals, tight production, and dark gritty environments are the icing on the cake.",1253750400,21,4366,4.954732510288066
3923879,5,B002FOQXXM,Heat Guy J is all I remember it to be. The characters are memorable and the music is incredible. This is a great purchase for folks who like off the wall story lines.,1384646400,,166,4.0606060606060606
3923880,4,B002FOQXXM,"So far, my order was perfect as far as appearances go. The series itself for me was a one time watch so far. I honestly couldn't get into it sometimes but it was over all average and good. I only recommend this anime to those who love the gun detective anime series. I'm more of a fantasy girl, so i'm not surprised that this series made it only into my ok list. I just had to satisfy a curiosity to finish the series.",1371513600,,418,4.048192771084337
3923881,5,B002FOQXXM,"Heat Guy J is an amazing piece of work.  The music is memorable and really sets the tone in the show.  The animation is great and the story is unforgettable.  I hate hyping something up so much, but it really is great.",1368230400,,218,4.142857142857143

3923885,3,B002FOQXXM,"The quality of the S.A.V.E. version of Heat Guy J was very good. The picture quality looked less compressed than I expected and the sound was very clear. The 3 star rating is for the packaging. As with all of the S.A.V.E. DVDs I've purchased, all (or most) of the spokes on the DVD hubs arrive broken off and loose in the case. This leaves nothing for the DVD to rest in and the DVDs end up bouncing around in transit. I always end up buying more clear cases and transferring the insert and DVDs to them. What I ""S.A.V.E."" in money I end up spending on another case(s). One might wonder if this was the sellers fault but it doesn't matter where I buy the S.A.V.E. DVDs. They always arrive with the spokes broken.",1325721600,2,712,4.281481481481482

with action, suspense and comedy.  I can't say more without giving away the series.",1300665600,,310,5.0588235294117645
3923887,5,B002FOQXXM,"I truly believe that if every anime fan looked past the strange name and gave this show a watch, it would be every bit as legendary as Cowboy Bebop. Why do I compare it to Bebop? It has that cool factor. I can't even describe the quality put into every aspect of the show. Not only that, but it even has a very nice setting. The animation is amazing. Art is beautiful and unique. The music is just incredible. Like nothing I've ever heard in anime.

The only downfall is the overall story. While each episode has a good story itself, the overall story doesn't amount to much.

Overall, a must-own.",1294790400,5,597,4.36936936936937
3923888,3,B002FOQXXM,"Heat Guy J had a lot going for it. But  I don't know where it went wrong . Did the writers get bored or was it rushed through to meet deadlines.
  What they should have called it is 'Dice and his robot sidekick'. Dice is a Spike Speigel wannabe only not as cool or tough . J is the most interesting character in this show and its like the creators just ignored his potential , except for a few episodes.
  I personally think if they had made J the main character ( like the title suggests ) and left Dice as the second fiddle , they would have had a better shot at a great show . That said , the show isn't awful , it has its moments , but it'll probably never make your top twenty list.",1279497600,,687,3.9136690647482015
8369490,4,B002FOQXXM,I can say this series was good I mean it's a sci-fi setting and some special police force.  Used to see this on MTV when it was good and could actually have this which was a long time ago not today.  Anyway really can recommend it for sci-fi anime fans and has some great voice actors including ones you may know.,1511654400,,313,4.114754098360656

8369492,2,B002FOQXXM,"I did get a great deal on this. But I was disappointed by the show. It's directed more at at the teen and under crowd, and it shows. Heat Guy J is closer to Saturday morning cartoons than anime in my opinion.",1458950400,,208,3.9761904761904763
8369493,3,B002FOQXXM,"Anime with mafia goons , androids, genetically altered humans, and Detectives.  I tried watching this series on a Samsung 3 series 32"" hdtv and found that though it barely shows enough video detail and the color and sounds ok. I brought the  Solty Rei S.A.V.E. at the same time and it is slightly better all around. Heatguy J video source seems very poor ,even on my old Daewoo 19"" flatscreen crt tv with comb filter , the picture noise is evident- it is like they used the the bare minimum quality with enough to discern most detail but the outlines are not smooth where normally they should be.",1440547200,2,596,4.5092592592592595
8369494,5,B002FOQXXM,"This is the Heat Guy J series. The DVDs (4) are in thin-pack sleeves. The introductory music is particularly good but the rest of the incidental and closing music is forgettable. Heat Guy J is the story of a government agency which is supposed to stop crimes happening. The agency has the only legal android in the city (The ""J(ay)"" of the title. In one sense this is the story of the relationship between J and his partner, Daiske Aurora. The first series mostly concerns the conflict between the special agency and an underworld crime family. The second series is about a government coup. The characters are well thought out and stand apart from the run of the mill anime characters. There's little or no fan service but the fight sequences are very good and the CGI and hand-drawn elements mesh together well. The final ending is a bit flat but this doesn't spoil an excellent and engaging series.",1437696000,,900,4.666666666666667
8369495,4,B002FOQXXM,"This is a very good anime, great action and story. Also heat guy j is a BADA@@  android.kicks serious tail and always has partner back. I wish they would release on bluray",1431475200,,171,4.34375
8369496,3,B002FOQXXM,"On a anime binge, I picked this up after reading some really shining reviews that made it seem as if it it had a lot of dark themes. I was actually disappointed when everything was bright and shining and new looking. Plus it uses CG technology to animate action sequences, which I never think look good. The subject matter it touched on really wasn't all that deep, or dark.  So I'm not sure where I got the dark impression from, but it was completely incorrect.

I honestly didn't like Daisuke, the main character. Too two dimensional and not very interesting. One of those characters that is never surprised and always seems to be talking with his eyes closed and his arms crossed.  The main antagonist, Clair, is just like him and only became interesting in the last act. And the ""Tips to being Man"" given --constantly--  by J, were at sometimes funny, but ultimately annoying.

Everyone else however, was entertaining. Kyoko, Monica, Antonia, and Ken are all part of the core group that lend something to the active story per episode, and to the overall story arc, which has a ""twist"" villain ending, but I saw it half way through. Plus the eventual stand-off between Daisuke and J is painfully obvious in episode one.

It's a good series as a whole, but very slow and waits until the last quarter to become interesting.
The characters are only so so.
The visuals are okay when not in CG.
And J's steam ""howl"" haunts me in my nightmares.",1426032000,,1441,4.609375
