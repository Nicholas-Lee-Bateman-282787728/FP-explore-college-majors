8105074,2,B000E3722C,"This title is ok to borrow from your local public library, but do not pay $25 for this.  This is a 50 minute episode of the History Channel series The Most.  While many of the battles and military commanders recounted here are intersting, apporximatley 1/3 are not and really do not belong with the others.  Segments such as Carrier Pidgeons, the U.S. Camel Cavalry Corp and Roman Collesium Naval Contests are not even in the same league as the segments on The Jutland, Battle for Berlin and Alexander the Great and thus detract from the overall DVD.",1181001600,,550,4.649484536082475
