7725916,5,B01DX0NCPI,Season 5 is the best season in the show so far with so many memorable episodes and new characters.,1461628800,3,98,4.2105263157894735
7725917,5,B01DX0NCPI,"Finally, I've been waiting for this season to come out on DVD for a while now. I loved this season. In my opinion it's the best season of MLP:FIM so far. Since I don't care about Blu-Ray releases I couldn't be happier.",1461283200,6,218,4.214285714285714
7725918,5,B01DX0NCPI,"Wow, What a season!  This season has been among the best so far.  And the closing episode closed it off amazingly!  Tara Strong and the Hasbro crew have pulled off a great one here.  I can't wait to get this Season on DVD.  definitely recommended! ",1460937600,9,248,4.4
7725919,1,B01DX0NCPI,"Everything about this release is awful. The packaging is cheap vector art with no creative originality involved in creating the cover or inside artwork,  and there is no Blu-ray release, even after fans have pleaded for them for the last four years. That also being said, the season itself is a joke. Mostly terrible unoriginal episodes with only a few good episodes here and there, mostly in the first half of the season. The premiere and finale with Starlight Glimmer is some of the worst writing this show has ever seen.",1460937600,4,523,4.747252747252747

7725921,5,B01DX0NCPI,"I finished watching My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic season 5 recently. I immensely enjoyed it.

 The idea of Cutie-Map-Adventures is a good one because it enables different kinds of episodes. It's a Quest narrative like adventurers from another genre, but instead of something like ""defeat the evil overlord"" it is ""solve a friendship problem"". This means that the Mane Six can help someone else with their problem, in a new setting, without having to argue with each other to provide an episode's conflict.

 I also like it because it shows that the writers/directors etc. aren't afraid to change the status quo. The core of the show remains the same but the nature of some of the episodes changes, there is a change to the cast (addition rather than subtraction, which I think goes better) and progress is made on another front. I'm excited to see where this is going.

 Some of the episodes have a lot of songs (so many they're practically a musical), but they're good songs so I enjoy them.

 Starlight Glimmer is another example of this series finding new ways to express the same core. She is a villain with a warped idea of friendship that tries to enforce this idea on others. That is not something that has been done in the series before. Nor is she some evil eldritch monster like previous Big Bads (such as Nightmare Moon, Discord, Chrysalis, or Tirek). She's just a unicorn with power, talent, and a lot of motivation to fulfill her evil plan.

 Some episodes were weaker than others. ""What about Discord"", for instance, is one that I think tried too hard pushing its central conflict. I still like but not as much as others, such as ""Rarity Investigates"". Being a novelist, ""Canterlot Boutique"" struck a special cord with me.

If you haven't seen My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic yet, I highly recommend it. It is family oriented with humor and stories that are directed towards both children and parents.

They are certainly going to some serious places with this. There is a maturity in this season that I am very impressed with. It is good that they don't obscure the consequences of genuinely bad decisions.",1481241600,5,440,4.9324324324324325

However adults can enjoy it too If they just give it a try. Season five is the best so far,and the series just keeps getting better ever season. The lessons it teaches are truly worth watching. With a fantastic voice cast and amazing adventures and characters MLPFIM is a  MUST SEE TV for anyone young or old.  I never saw the original series back in the 80s. But I have been a huge fan of Hasbro animated shows since I was a kid. I highly recommend MLPFIM. What season?

7725980,5,B01DX0NCPI,"Ever since the first season, the mythos of MLP: Friendship is Magic has only gotten bigger, better, and more complex. Our six main characters have seen a ton of development; growing up before our eyes. Never was this radical change more apparent than in this season, which includes Rarity expanding her fashion line all across Equestria, a certain royal couple having a baby, the Cutie Mark Crusaders FINALLY earning their cutie marks; more than a few call backs to the earliest season one episodes that'll make you re-watch them in an all new light, and the introduction of an unexpected student/apprentice to Twilight Sparkle. All the episodes of the fifth season are included (with the two part season premiere and finale split into separate episodes).

The episode quality is excellent. Though, I wish there was more in the way of special features. Other than a featurette about the MLP segment at ComiCon, this is a pretty cut and dry release, but as it stands, if you're a fan of the show, owning this set is a must! :D",1468540800,,1025,4.758426966292135

8757166,5,B01DX0NCPI,"Season5 introduces an interesting character and dives into themes of individuality or equality, loss of a pet, sibling roles, forgiving those you once called your friend, and the effect ones attitude can have on the whole world as we know it. Themes I'm sure kids will appreciate when they've grown up and look back at this show.
Plus the 100th episode is on this and it's AWESOME!
Bonus features include SDCC 2015 MLP Panel and Sing-Alongs.
I personally say this is the 2nd best season of MLP so it's worth owning physically.",1516665600,,526,4.728260869565218

8757168,5,B01DX0NCPI,"For me, Season 5 of My Little Pony is where the series really began.  Prior to this season, there was something about the show that although I enjoyed, never made me want to buy the seasons and watch them over and over again.  Season 5 changed that.  This was the first season of the show that I felt expanded beyond the world of the six ponies and started to establish realms and places beyond Equestria.  The Cutie Map is a huge part of that, and gives an opportunity to pair characters that would not normally be paired to experience these places.  It also introduced a relatable villain that was not evil at her core, but had a warped view of friendship that made her turn her back on it.

Episode Highlights of the Season for Me

Make Friends But Keep Discord
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone
Party Pooped
Rarity Investigates
Made in Manhattan
Brotherhooves Social
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows
The Hoofields and Mccolts
The Mane Attraction",1512000000,,947,4.601190476190476
8757169,1,B01DX0NCPI,"I DON'T think Starlight Glimmer trying to BRIANWASH the Mane Six, and make them lose their Identities AKA Loss of Cutie Marks was taken seriously enough by the show. THAT'S THE STUFF YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE EXPIREANCING IN CULTS! They still made her ""A New Friend"" at the end of the season. In ""Felicity: An American Girl Adventure"" Jiggy Nye's abuse towards Penny ISN'T lost on us even at, and after his act of Kindness. The film makes it clear that animal abuse is SERIOUS.  Starlight Glimmer's actions were CANCELLED OUT by Twilight saying she used magic well, even though her Friends were rightfully concerned, because a few seconds earlier. she had destroyed the Physics of Time! The only message MLP wants to tell your girls is ""BE FRIENDS!"". I get the feeling that the MLP writers DON'T UNDERSTAND SERIOUS MATTERS! Plus if this were meant for boys, because it is FANTASY, Starlight Glimmer would get her butt kicked!
