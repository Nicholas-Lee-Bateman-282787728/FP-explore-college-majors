8169909,4,B000MM1DIE,A good book to read if you want to know about Six Day racing.,1465603200,,61,3.4285714285714284
8169910,5,B000MM1DIE,"Awesome video about the early history of bike racing. I doubt very many cyclists, even die-hards, know that cyclists were much better paid than any other athletes of that time, including baseball players and golfers. My only dislike is the soundtrack.",1435276800,,251,5.146341463414634
8169911,5,B000MM1DIE,"Amazing facts from our (USA) long forgotten sports past, like American bicycle racer Bobby Walthour making $10,000 a year, at the same time Ty Cobb was making $5,000 a year playing pro-baseball.  During the ""roaring 20's"" movie stars, gangsters (Al Capone among some), poets (Ernest Hemmingway), the wealthy, and the gamblers, crowded cycling tracks all over our country (ie, Madison Square Gardens was built as a bicycle track venue) to watch and experience the drama of these ""Six Day"" bicycle races
The ""Six Day"" race (24 hrs a day - 6 days straight, 2-man teams) will always be considered the most difficult, and enduring, (more so than the Tour-de-France). BTW, Tour-de-France started as a ""six-day outdoor"" bicycle race.

Still can't believe there has not been movies made about this once, truly popular American sport (it's such a big part of our history). Countless amazing stories to be told, as pro-racers from all arouind the world once came to America to compete in OUR ""Six Day"" bicycle races.",1435017600,,1006,5.017964071856287
8169912,5,B000MM1DIE,"I bought both the DVD and book. Well worth the money if you're interested in learning about six-day racing in the States. I've been a track rider and ardent fan of track racing for more than 40 years, and the book and DVD helped bring to life a branch of the sport that I'd feared would be forgotten. It was a nice surprise to find Oscar Wastyn mentioned - he sold me my first track bike in 1964 and got me seriously interested in the sport. If you're at all interested in the history of bike racing in this country, get either the book or the DVD or both - you won't regret it.",1268956800,,578,4.078947368421052
8169913,5,B000MM1DIE,"If you love bicycle race history and interveiws with past stars you will love this. There is some excellent vintage footage. I can't believe pro team ""sports"" have taken over the public's interest.  After watching this video you will want to experience the Madison first hand. The thrill of the race the characters and the culture surrounding these times is captured in this video and the companion book.",1206662400,,404,4.9411764705882355
8169914,5,B000MM1DIE,Seeing this dvd is like all the stories my grandfather told me about the six-days is coming back to life. He learned everything there is to know about the six-days and i've assisted to so many six-days here in Europe and i had my own hero: Australia's Danny Clark. I just love the track-races and especially hte madison!!,1200873600,3,321,4.551724137931035

8169916,5,B000MM1DIE,"This is a must own for any bicycle enthusiast, collector, advocate, competitor or, simply anyone interested in what was arguably the most popular sport in America at one time.
