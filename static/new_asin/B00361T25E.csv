I found them to contain a great deal of information, presented in a style that builds upon itself. Going from novice all the way to some seriously advanced skiing, they consistantly stay with the two main fundementals balance & confidence. Yes there is lots of technique presented, but it's all built upon a solid foundation of these fundementals. In addition to the how to ski material, there is a ton of extra stuff on equipment, safety, fitness, where to ski, and more. There are other fine skiing DVDs, but I think This series gives you the most current thinking regarding modern skiing, and they are fun to watch. The cinematography is beautiful, and the music is quite good as well (in case you're interested in these things). Just be patient and enjoy the show. I would recommend them to skiers of every level.",1313539200,,959,4.714285714285714
