6815862,1,B00PKOYV4M,This movie made absolutely no sense!!! It was sure freakin great for the late night sleepy sillies though! I never laughed so hard in all my life.,1485734400,,146,4.444444444444445
6815863,3,B00PKOYV4M,"A silly and fun little B-Movie, the Legend of Black Annie takes itself too seriously while not taking itself seriously at all. Intentionally (?) over the top and campy, it makes for a nice daytime watch.",1485561600,,203,4.666666666666667

6815869,5,B00PKOYV4M,"This was one of the best urban legend movies I've seen!  I felt that the actors did an excellent job!  There was the use of the""N....."" word only a few times. I would recommend that TV/Media stop the use of this word.  It is a way to keep degrading black people although the ""N....."" word does not have any relations to black people.  In the dictionary, it means ""ignorant .""  You keep putting a person down and eventually they bite back which is not a solution.  I realise though that this movie was set back in a time period where the ""N....."" word was used but we still need to break from the use of any words or symbols that make people feel uncomfortable and hurt.  The movie itself was very CREEPY!
It goes back to the old saying that "" what goes around comes around and that justice prevails regardless if the Law does not take action but tries to hide/cover up things.""  The 3 actors who played the men who were talking about and indicating that something was not right about what occurred with the victims at the diner were very funny and helped to create an atmosphere of  an ominous feeling throughout the movie.  I really liked this movie!!!",1483660800,,1153,4.39622641509434

6815876,1,B00PKOYV4M,"If you look at my history you will see that among the hundreds of reviews for movies that I have written I have never said that a movie is the worst movie I've ever seen, but I'm saying it now!",1430524800,4,193,3.85
6815877,2,B00PKOYV4M,"This was probably better than  I had expected.  It is an ""indie"", so what do you expect with limited financing, etc.  I congratulate the people involved for making this movie and getting it released.  I purchased this movie because I was born in Bluefield, WV, and some scenes were shot in the house owned by my aunt and uncle, and where I spent a lot of time as a young boy.  It is now a bed and breakfast, and my wife and I visited there a couple of years ago.",1428019200,3,462,4.088888888888889
6815878,4,B00PKOYV4M,"This is an independently made film that is set in the deep, deep south and is an interpretation of an urban legend. The basic concept is that it is a horror story with a moral in the midst of much immorality.  Comic relief is found in three guys at a diner as they offer their theories on the various mishaps that begin to occur and there is a fair amount of blood and guts along the way.  Fans of this genre will enjoy adding this movie to their collection.",1427155200,,458,4.134831460674158
6815879,2,B00PKOYV4M,"The film opens Oct. 13, 1973. Annie is harassed by three boys and leaps to her death. In the flashbacks we later find out there is a cover-up, her mom knew voodoo, who is also dead. The film then jumps to 1986, then 1999, and the last part is in 2012. It is simple math, a blind man could do it, and does.

The ghosts of Annie and her mom cause the people involved to kill themselves and I wasn't sure how that one student fit in. Much of the film is three guys talking about what has happened without saying anything. Joe Willis (Arthur Richardson) a blind man dominates the conversation and was one of the worse actors I have seen. It was at the level, ""so bad, it's good."" While the rest of the feature had bad acting, it wasn't up to the cheese level as Joe Willis although Christy Oldham comes close.

Terrence Flack wrote, produced, directed, and starred in this film.

campy humor, but still a loser.
