2917130,1,B000U716A6,"I think an intelligent mind had great ideas when it made this movie. Sadly poor storytelling kept those ideas from being seen. The movie wants to be compelling and real and new and instead becomes unintresting alien and confusing.

Alot of things are left hanging as well, what was the point of the woman next door?, what was the so called fantasy of the boyfriend?, who are all those people in the cult-group any ways I could barely catch their names? Why is it that being a bitch is the liberating act for the girls at the end and how is that so untraditional? what is their grand philosophy and beliefs any way? Where are their Parents?/ if their parents are so out of the picture/messed up why do you expect me to buy that they are so ballanced?

This movie tries to be about love and sex and thinking outside the box, and judging by the commentary of the film maker that was what was intended, however that is not what it ended up being. In the end this is a movie about Cults.

The kids are in a sex cult and one of them wants to get out. only its only loosely a cult. so realy its a Defanged Cult.

Honestly the whole thing is silly and I kind of feel stupider for having watched it.",1213401600,5,1190,4.206140350877193
2917131,1,B000U716A6,"If you loved the original Havoc you will HATE this movie.  It does no justice to the original which was smart, gritty, and insightful.  This is just stupid.  Don't buy it, its 2 hours of your life you'll never get back.",1207785600,2,219,4.2926829268292686
2917132,4,B000U716A6,"if you liked the original Havoc then you'll love this.  i love it because of its originality and its uniqueness.  its offbeat yet a great movie in my opinion.  i don't like giving away anything so i won't ill just leave it at  if you like odd movies such as the original Havoc,Thirteen, or Kids then this movie is for you.

2917133,2,B000U716A6,"I was curious about this movie because Amber Tamblyn is in it. Having not particularly been able to relate to the characters of the first Havoc
movie, I found myself at even a bigger loss here. These are lost, lost souls and the characters that are the most redeemable are more lost than everyone else. I'm not sure if the movie was going for a non-judgmental feel or simply didn't know where to take the storyline.",1195603200,2,415,4.473684210526316
2917134,5,B000U716A6,"I saw this on cable TV about a month ago and loved it.  It was basic cable so some language and possibly content was edited a bit.  It was still pretty sexy, so I can't wait to get this version.  The acting is great.  I hadn't heard of Ashton Holmes before, but I really liked him, and Amber Tamblyn is a great actress.
I wouldn't be surprised that some teenagers are doing this kind of stuff.  Everyone knows teens are having sex at pretty young ages, so it's not a stretch to think that a group of close friends could be having group sex.  The best part of the movie is the relationship between Sean and Wendy.  I think it's sweet how he wants her to leave her group and be just with him in a ""normal"" relationship.  And they have tons of chemistry in their scenes together.
I strongly recommend this movie for people 17 and up.",1192838400,11,830,4.208860759493671
2917135,5,B000U716A6,so i didn't get to see the whole movie but from what i saw it was completely amazing. it is crazy to think things like this is going on in high school and it probably is. i cant wait for it to come out on dvd.,1189987200,,209,3.5652173913043477

2917137,3,B000U716A6,"Not crazy about all the implied group sex, scenes of public sex, or frivolous nature of intimate moments but liked the individual stand taken near the end. Would have better if greater self-worth was discovered by the teens rather than hiding in co-dependency. No actual nudity. A few good songs but no soundtrack found.",1426204800,,320,4.944444444444445

2917142,4,B000U716A6,"Hint: read the reviews for the DVD; the two or three ratings on the Instant Video page aren't exactly descriptive.

I gotta say, I liked this movie. It explores complex relationships that appear sometimes raw and jarring, in a very real way. Amber Tamblyn does an awesome job throughout the film. Points for an original script and trying something new and different.

Now, as the 1-star reviews mention, plenty of things could've been better. I'm not sure Sean's emotions and motives came across clearly. There was the whole plot thread with Wendy's brother and Sean's mom that didn't go anywhere - in fact, several scenes bring up new information that isn't tied into the movie's plotline. And there are enough minor nit-picks for CinemaSins to have a field day with.

Many people salivate over the sexual element of the film (R-rated! Teen sex!), but try to look past that and appreciate the story as a whole. It may not be the best acted or best scripted movie ever, but do give it a watch.",1414800000,2,993,4.695402298850575

2917146,5,B000U716A6,"I wouldn't recommend this for teenagers under the age of 15, but other than that this was a great movie. It provides a great example of the issues regarding sex that our teenagers face today.

2917150,1,B000U716A6,"It was terrible.

Acting: (besides the two main characters)is just bad. Makes me wonder if they just picked up people off the streets and put them a little bit of money and ask them to be in a movie.

The story line was poorly written but i am sure because I was not ""normal"" therefore i couldn't possibly know what normal adolescent behaviors are.

overall : just not a fan of the movie.",1365465600,,388,4.287671232876712

2917154,4,B000U716A6,"This film is a special take on the ""we'll be friends forever"" fantasy shared by most high school students. It is a disturbing film about group think, group feel, and group behavior. The peer pressure issue is taken to a new level. But the film also contrasts group with individual maturation. A well written script, well directed and acted. The cinematography reveals the characters in subtle ways. Viewers interested in psychology, sociology, and communication should find ""Normal Adolescent Behavior"" revealing and stimulating.",1218758400,9,529,5.463414634146342
2917155,5,B000U716A6,"I understand why some might give poor reviews to this movie, but I simply loved it.

It is a teen movie dealing with very adult issues, which no doubt makes it difficult to find an audience. However, the movie delves into a variety of relationship issues that are rarely dealt with at all--much less in the colorful and nuanced manner we find here.

This movie explores that intense and deeply felt line between being true to oneself on the one hand, while allowing love, friendship, loyalty, and open-mindedness to have their various impacts on the heart and soul.

It does start a bit slow, and doesn't really hit its stride until about halfway point; but for me, the build-up was well worth it.

The honesty, struggles, and emotional depth expressed by Wendy (played by Amber Tamblyn) was, for me,the real heart of the movie.

This movie is not for everyone, but if exploring emotional territory with integrity--human flaws and all--in the full quirky glory of life, is of interest to you, then I strongly recommend this beautifully acted and heartfelt movie.",1218326400,16,1062,4.845303867403315

8212301,4,B000U716A6,"Normal Adolescent Behavior is just an okay film.  From a storytelling point of view it doesn't feel like it's written in a compelling enough manner because often these teens interact with each other in a nonchalant way without accomplishing anything noteworthy or enjoyable for the viewer, but then again isn't that what teens are supposed to be like?  I guess you could argue these teens are portrayed more accurately than in other films that attempt teenage behavior.

But then you have the sexual stuff which is shown in raw detail.  It comes across surreal since most films tend to tie sex scenes into drugs, filthy mouths and overall dirtiness and disrespect for ones self and for others (parents and friends particularly).  But here, in Normal Teenage Behavior, sex is treated as a perfectly natural act between people who just want to explore each others bodies.  There's no real build-up when these moments occur, playing up to the ""normal"" part.  They just happen naturally.  It's just an interesting and different spin on the sexual feelings of teenagers than we're used to seeing (arguably a more accurate one).

But the acting isn't the best in the world, and the storytelling never really achieves greatness, and the concept itself is only passable.  I'll be nice and give the film 4 stars even though it has flaws.  Maybe I'll appreciate the story more in the future and come back with a 5-star rating.  Who knows.  Recommended.",1430697600,,1442,4.909090909090909
