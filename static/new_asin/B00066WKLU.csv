8039439,2,B00066WKLU,"I love the story of Daniel and his willingness to obey God!  This was purchased because it was going to be used in a musical production of Jesus Christ.  The portion I want to used was defected.  Some parts of the movie went totally blank or a blue screen.  Some parts of the movie flickered.  I requested my money back and I was satisfied that my money was returned.  Maybe one day someone will remaster this VHS, and I will be purchasing it.",1307577600,,443,4.27710843373494
