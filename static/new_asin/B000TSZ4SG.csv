8210912,2,B000TSZ4SG,I loved Laguna Beach season 3 and am quite upset that the dvds are not released for Region 1! They should get on this ASAP!,1399248000,,123,3.96
8210913,5,B000TSZ4SG,"When will they release this great season on DVD? Before my thoughts, a quick personal story. The year was 2008 and I had just started dating my current fiancee. I was out drinking with co-workers and planning to go over to her apartment afterwards. Co-workers forced me to drink lots of vodka shots. I made it to her apartment, to her bed, then threw up all over her floor and rug area. She wanted nothing to do with me. To win her heart, back I had Laguna Beach Season 1 DVD's couriered over to her at work. We have been happy together ever since. True story. Hopefully my future employers don't think less of me for this. Our second fight, of course I bought her Laguna Beach Season 2 DVD's. I am out of ammo if I ever do anything dumb again.

Anyway, I love the Laguna Beach franchise even its offshoots - The Hills and The City (obviously The City to a much lesser extent) and for some reason Laguna Season 3 never gets its due. This is largely due to the changed cast. The cast of season 3 was still good though! Jessica (""Jess Bombs"" - Matt C) makes a return appearance to date a high school junior. You go gurl. New additions Kyndra and Cami add mean-girl humor. I personally like Tessa. Breanna is annoying and Rocky is awful but I mean, come on, what cast is all hits?

Tyler is the one who truly makes this season special. When he is bbq-ing in his $500 shirt to impress Kyndra, it was man-crush as soon as he opened his mouth.

GIVE US THESE DVDS. In the words of Bad News Bears: Breaking Training - LET THEM PLAY",1368921600,,1524,4.248275862068965
8210914,1,B000TSZ4SG,"I am a big fan of the Laguna Beach/ The Hills/ The City phenomenon, but this season lacked an interesting cast. Lauren Conrad and Kristin Cavallari just have more of an ""it"" factor and are more compelling to watch than anyone of season three's cast. In my opinion they also chose the wrong person to narrate it. Nothing against the girl, but it just didn't make for very entertaining television.",1249948800,5,395,4.6571428571428575
8210915,5,B000TSZ4SG,I LOVE THIS SHOW AND WISH THE 3RD SEASON WOULD COME OUT ALREADY!!! WHY IS IT TAKING SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LONG?????????,1229644800,5,118,5.2631578947368425
8210916,4,B000TSZ4SG,"I loved the first and second seasons and i do miss that lc and kristin couldn't come back. i did think at least, kristin would come into the third show.",1207008000,5,152,4.1
