The case and sleeve for the movie was destroyed. The cardboard sleeve for the case had a lot of scuffs and holes in it. And the protective case was cracked and broken in multiple locations. Its important to note that the shipping envelope/  package was not damaged and did not show signs of being damaged while in shipment.  This edition had a 4k disc and blu Ray copy. Luckily the 4k disc was ok... but the blu Ray didn't fair so well.  The damage to the casing transferred to the blu Ray disc. Normally I would return this for a new copy, but the 4k edition disc is the reason I purchased it in the first place.

When people actually see this movie, they've always had to admit they're impressed. It's not your average thriller. There are some truly iconic scenes that really stand the test of time--none of the special effects seem cheesy with age, it's pretty incredible. If you're into strong, flawed female characters, look no further than Sarah Connor who is the most bad ass mom you'll ever find. It's such a refreshing departure from the usual Hollywood script, has really interesting spins on child-parent dynamics, and you get to see a guy made of liquid steel stab at people through the roof of an elevator...what more could you possibly want in a movie?

Ironically compared to Thor:Ragnarok, the soundscape is much better. Thor, despite Dolby Atmos, is mostly anchored up front. But now I'm talking about Thor.

Unfortunately, DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) was applied to the UHD release which ""cleans"" the grain from the picture and gives everything a very digital and waxy-like appearance. For purists, this is not what you want. The color timing was also changed. Gone is the steely blue look that we are used to and now has a more green hue.

2131160,5,B0002WYTWG,"One of my favorite movies of all time. A lot of people like T2 the best, but I still say this one is a step ahead. Yes, the effects may not be as cool, and yes the 80's techno soundtrack may be a little distracting in a couple of scenes. But knowing the backstory of making the film, and what limited resources James Cameron had to make it a reality, what he created with them is incredible. Arnold is terrifying as the terminator, of course. Michael Biehn is intense and compelling as Sgt Kyle Reese. And Linda Hamilton really shows how a struggling student-waitress can become a terminator-crushing badass. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also have great chemistry together throughout, which makes the ending that much more tragic. The gritty hopelessness of the ""future world"" in Kyle's flashbacks carry over into the ""present day"" of 1984 LA, making you appreciate the struggle against Arnold's character even more. What else can I say, I love this movie, and I come back to it again and again.",1518134400,,999,4.714285714285714

Also disappointed that the director's cut was not included in 4K (in this era of branching technology, it could have been). This 4K version was made from the recently remastered 3D version, (it's even labeled as the 3D version in the credits, but the movie in actual 3D was not included in the set).",1517270400,,392,4.458333333333333

2131167,4,B0002WYTWG,"I can watch this movie 1000 times. Though I honestly think I have. This review will be on the 4K HDR transfer.

From the scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger enters the bar you can see the upscale in details. You could make out each individual chest hair and his weathered leather jacket and boots had remarkable clarity and depth. Though the transfer isn't perfect. The uptick in facial features, hair and surrounding objects is definitely welcomed, there are scenes that are soft, bordering on lifeless. Also in there is a cold teal colour throughout the film that wasn't present in the original 2K version.

When the film debut in theaters I was only 2 years old so I have never seen the theatrical release and I now I wished I never had. It a shame that they couldn't have included the director's cut as well. It made the film the classic that it is. Additionally they opted to retain the original soundtrack in DTS-HD Master Audio instead of a newer Dolby Atmos or DTS X version. With a multitude of heights element it's asinine.

As this is the third time that I have bought T2, I have to admit despite some shortcomings it was worth it. T2 has never looked so good.",1517097600,,1169,4.530805687203792

Now, this has THE best, in my opinion of older contemporary movies so far (and I'm looking at you Batman Begins.  Shame on you!) 4K transfer so far.  It looks amazing!  Except....James Cameron had a bad habit of doing this with Aliens and The Abyss AND this movie,,,releasing an ""extended"" version of his movie that made you go ""Ahhhhh.  That's why!"".  If you are given more information about something and said that to yourself during the movie that SHOULD have been released as the ""original"" version, then that means the original is technically a fail.  So a 4K transfer of the 154min version of this movie that should be on a list of all-time classics for numerous reasons?

The Standard Blu-ray disc contains all 3 cuts of the film however only the ""Theatrical"" scenes have been remastered. Furthermore some of the ""Theatrical"" scenes are also non-remastered to enable a smooth blending when showing the ""Extended Special Edition"" scenes. None of the ""Extended Special Edition"" scenes have received a ""2017"" re-master. Only those who have watched the movie multiple times would have noticed this though.

2131187,5,B0002WYTWG,"I'd forgotten just how much fun TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY was. Perhaps that's because Arnold Schwarzenegger went on to become Governor of California. Or maybe because Edward Furlong went on to become a bad actor. Or maybe because star Linda Hamilton seemed to disappear from any major release after this film came out. It certainly isn't for lack of a copy to resurface time and time again with numerous repackaging items to stir up interest. But this time around it's worth the extra effort.

If you're not aware of the story the first film told of a killer robot, a terminator, sent back in time after robots have tried to take over the world. His mission is to prevent the birth of John Connor who will go on to lead the resistance and take down the robots. The film ended with the robot crushed and Sarah Connor (Hamilton) pregnant with her son John and on the road.

The second film opens in the future where John is sending back a message. This time the terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns the same as last time, unclothed and in need of transportation. Another person from the future arrives as well (Robert Patrick). While the two of them go in search of clothing and transport we get a glimpse of Sarah and John.

John is a punk kid, living in a foster home where he's hit those ripe teen years where he's rebellious and uncooperative. He rides a motorcycle and hangs out at the mall. Sarah, on the other hand, is in a mental ward. Her claims of an apocalyptic future are thought to be the ravings of a lunatic and she's medicated most of the time.

As we watch and witness both Patrick and Schwarzenegger track down John, we wonder how on earth he can survive. When Schwarzenegger shows up, gun in hand, and begins shooting at Patrick we suddenly realize that he has been sent back to save not kill John. The two escape in one of the most action packed sequences ever filmed filled with plenty of skilled driving and high end special effects.

Surviving the pair rescue Sarah and head out. When Schwarzenegger provides them the information they need as to how the entire robotic world came to be, they set out to prevent that from happening. The action sequences that follow combine the worlds of stunt men and effects to maximum effort as we watch the final battle follow.

Director James Cameron is one of the most technically gifted directors you will find. In watching the film again I marveled at the ease with which the effects were planted here and there and noticed that a number of them would be used again in his future films like THE ABYSS. But it's not just his use of effects. He is a grand story teller as well, providing the information needed to follow along and involve the viewer. He adds touches of humor to the action going on which rounds out the film nicely.

So why bother investing in this version being released now when we've had so many variations available to us in the past? For one thing those fortunate enough to have invested in a 4k screen and player will now be able to watch the movie in the cleanest most high definition image possible. The movie was amazing before but imagine a picture to high on the quality scale that you can be amazed by a film made 26 years ago. The quality here is such that it looks more like it was made recently rather than all those years ago.

Extras here include a number of things including three different versions of the film, 2 different commentary tracks, deleted scenes with commentary, a 30 minute making of featurette, trailers and a 55 minute documentary called T2: REPROGRAMMING THE TERMINATOR. All of these make this the ultimate version of the film.

One more thing about this new edition. Not only does it come with the 4k restoration versions of the film but it includes the blu-ray edition as well as a digital edition. And it's being released at an affordable price as well. So if you want to watch this film in the best way possible, make sure you pick up a copy today.",1515024000,,3964,4.5251396648044695

Insult to injury, the German track is 7.1 and sounds better. LAZY LAZY LAZY mess. Do not buy.",1514851200,,585,4.327272727272727

In truth I probably would've gave it a four star review but because of the such harsh rating I figure I would bump that one star to five stars",1514764800,,510,4.3125
2131191,2,B0002WYTWG,There are no special features and no extended directors cut on this version. A baffling decision! I sold my loaded blu-ray to pick up this copy.

2131193,2,B0002WYTWG,"I normally don't write reviews on Amazon but when I do it's either for the product being really good or very disappointing. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a true classic that James Cameron in the 90's made history. Sadly this release is very disapointing and all involved including Cameron should be ashamed. Movie is theatrical run, no extended cut, noise reduction, CG added to shots, audio only 5.1, no 3D disc added. Movie is a true classic but here what was added and changed was just a big scratch in the head. It's like Cameron pulled a Lucas and changed the film completely. Why changed what work? So what's my thoughts? Film looked the cleanest it ever looked and it did look good but what off put the movie was how waxy everyone looked especially Arnold in some scenes it looked weird as hell. Having noise reduction was such a stupid move it's a quite picture and it should of never got rid of the background noise. Audio 5.1 track should of been Dolby Atmos track this movie needed a boost but what's weird is this 5.1 track seemed like a downgrade from the Blu-ray. The CG added knife and CG Arnold face on stuntman was such a wtf moment for me it was a slap in the face. Knife wasn't bad but the CG face you could tell and looked horrible especially in motion during the truck chase in the beginning. Tinting of the film is such a downer. If you watch Terminator or Cameron films enough the tinting has always had a blue tint and very retro like. Here was a greenish tint and was not needed. HDR popped at times especially the playground flashback scene but overall wasn't expecting much. This release is a disapoinment. It had it's solid moments but if you have the Blu -ray pass. If you do pick it up price isn't bad but it's just a shock how this came out. Disappointed Terminator fan here this should have been a hit and cared with love but it wasn't. Up to you but I say pass if have the Blu- ray but if you don't get it. It is the best version out there but take it with a grain of salt. Blu-ray still the best. 4k movies have never disapponted me since they released but this one really pissed me off and disappointed me. Just ashamed.",1514764800,,2156,4.339108910891089

if have a 4k upscaling tv then i suggest to sticking with the best BR release of terminator 2 so far the skynet edition which came out a few years ago. this 4K is just the theatrical edition. some scenes were done masterfully while others not so much. ive been looking forward to this 4k release for a while but it was sort of a let down. at least you get an awesome movie to watch though",1514678400,,449,4.044943820224719

2131197,2,B0002WYTWG,"For anyone expecting their purchase of this remastered version of Terminator 2: Judgment Day to include a digital copy of the remastered version advertised on the cover... IT DOESN'T.  It's just a digital copy of the standard 1991 theatrical version.  It is NOT this remastered version.

It's kinda like if you bought the Special Edition of Star Wars, and it advertised a digital copy inside, but the digital code actually redeemed the classic 1977 theatrical edition.  Of course, in that case, it would be a good thing... But it still wouldn't be what you paid for.

Anyway, I'm really disappointed about that.  I already had the 1991 theatrical version in my digital library.  So I'm feeling like I got duped.",1514592000,,711,4.875
2131198,5,B0002WYTWG,I had heard people complaining about DNR or over processing of the image ruining the 4k experience of this film. I think it looks amazing though.

2131199,5,B0002WYTWG,I had low expectations since T2 is a relatively old title. This 4K release is a pleasant surprise. Its hard to describe and the best way I can put it is it looks like a modern movie set in the 90s. Its definitely worth the price I paid for.,1514505600,,240,3.9183673469387754

2131201,2,B0002WYTWG,They went out of their way to screw us... As we all know the theatrical cut of T2 is fantastic. However the extended edition is even better. People don't buy T2 to watch the theatrical cut. But for some reason they only gave the theatrical cut the 4K treatment. Which makes no sense to me. Yes you get the other versions but just on standard blu ray. I see a lot of people complaining about no 3d (3d is almost dead anyways so a lot of people don't care) But cmon. Dont get fans excited for a 4K remastered version of arguably the greatest action movie ever made if your plan is just to show one version that way...,1514419200,,615,4.176470588235294
2131202,5,B0002WYTWG,The 4k version is fantastic and really makes everything so life like in this great movie.  I have also purchased the 3D version from Amazon.uk and it is region locked.  The way I fixed this is I used a program called DVDFab to make a personal copy of the movie which also stripped the region code so I can play in my Sony Blu-ray player.  Both versions are great fun to watch and a must have in your Blu-ray library.,1514419200,,416,4.175
2131203,5,B0002WYTWG,"This review is for the 4k UHD Bluray released in the US on 2017-12-26.

The packaging says that all three versions of the movie are included, what is not mentioned is that the 4k disc only contains the theatrical version...!

The 4k disc looks great, it's an obvious improvement in picture quality.  But if you are wanting the movie in 4k for the full extended version, just wait.  I'm sure another version will be out in a year or 2 that has it.  The extended edition is my preferred version of this movie.  I already had that on bluray though, so this is disappointing.

If you have no copy of this movie on blu-ray, this is a good one to get.  On the standard bluray, all three versions of the movie are easily selected, no more hidden version (Extended Special Edition with alternate happy ending) that needed to be unlocked by typing in a code. (82997)

The Theatrical version is 137:08 in length. The first 33 seconds are a new Studio Canal logo followed by a note about the 3D version. The Theatrical version on the Skynet Edition is 137:20, which doesn't include the Studio Canal logo in that length, it starts at the Carolco logo.  This 45 second runtime discrepancy when compared to the skynet edition bluray is due to 45 seconds of additional credits in the Skynet edition that covering the Special Edition restoration. Those 45 extra seconds are present in both the Theatrical and Special Edition versions on the Skynet Edition Bluray.

The Special Edition is the best version of the movie, coming in at 153:13 in length. It contains the added scenes which imho make it a better film, while not including the future ""happy"" alternate ending, which doesn't fit in with all the successive sequels. The first 33 seconds are a new Studio Canal logo followed by a note about the 3D version.

The Extended Special Edition of the movie contains an alternate ending, which ultimately doesn't fit as canon since there were more sequels that do not fit with it (who knows, maybe that will change by the time we are done getting Terminator sequels).  For this reason it's not my favorite version.  This version is 155:56 in length. The first 33 seconds are a new Studio Canal logo followed by a note about the 3D version.

Extras: These are only on the standard bluray.
T2: Reprogramming the Terminator. This is a new 2017 documentary, and was pretty good. It's 54 minutes.
The Making of T2 - Documentary from 1993.  This 31 minute documentary is on all of the older editions of the movie that I am aware of.

Deleted Scenes:
T-1000's Search
Future Coda. This is the alternate ending in the Extended Special Edition of the movie.  So after watching the Special Edition, this can be quickly viewed without needing to re-watch the entire movie.

Trailers:
A new 2017 trailer for the 3d re-release of the movie in theaters in 2017.
3 more trailers from 1990/1991. One of these trailers, ""Building the perfect Arnold"", is pretty cool in that it shows a Terminator being assembled, which is not a scene in the movie. This was called the teaser trailer on the Skynet Edition Bluray.

The T2SE and T2THX trailers that were in the skynet edition are not included in this release.

Worth noting, this version's aspect ration is 2.40:1, whereas the Skynet Edition bluray is 2.35 to 1.  The original theatrical release was 2.39:1, so this version most closely matches the original film.",1514419200,,3376,4.686440677966102
2131204,3,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 is a great movie. No critiques there.. It's a classic.

But this 4K release is filled with issues.
Included in the set are the 4K and 1080p discs along with a slipcover and digital copy code, but that's about where the good ends.

ISSUES: This was originally supposed to be a 3D release. James Cameron went through an created a 3D version (similar to what he did with Titanic), but the release was cancelled in the US and replace with a 4K-only release.

In order to give a clear 3D picture, heavy DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) was applied to the movie; This is intended to remove image noise/grain, but removes details from the image in the process. This results in a very wax-like image (similar to fake skin softening) which is present throughout the entire film. I found it very distracting, especially on 4K and very much detracts from the image with how hard they pushed it. This is a bit unfortunate as there DOES appear to be more detail here.. but it goes from detail into a super waxy blur where you might be able to see skin texture by their nose/mouth but everything else looks like a wax sculpture. Details like wrinkles also disappear into a blur. Overall, compare to the Blu-Ray, there does seem to be a lot more detail and potential here, but it's so flawed with the heavy noise reduction that I kind of prefer the Blu-Ray.

Next up: You get the theatrical version. The special edition runs around 15-20 minutes longer and is NOT included here.

The color-timing is also very different. A teal tint throughout, the color is very different from prior releases.

It's actually really disappointing as this could have been an amazing set! The Special Edition (with Endo-arm) was cancelled; the 3D was cancelled and the 4K is filled with issues in image quality (which defeats the purpose of 4K) and missing the other versions.

In the end, I just can't recommend it. Even at the discounting price it's selling at, stick with the Blu-Ray.

If the Blu-Ray is any indication of things to come, we should expect many more upgrade versions of this on 4K down  the road.",1514332800,,2090,4.627027027027027
2131205,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the sequel to 1984s The Terminator, the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star. With sensational special effects and powerful performances by Schwarzenegger and cast, ..Judgment Day surpasses the original in sheer excitement and visceral thrills.

The story takes place a little over a decade after the events in the first movie, in which Los Angeles waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) was running for her life when she was targeted by a cyborg Terminator sent back from the year 2029. His goal: to kill her because she will eventually give birth to the leader of the human resistance fighting against the machines that have taken over the planet. This time, the target is future leader, John (Edward Furlong), now an 11-year-old juvenile delinquent living with a foster family because Sarah has been incarcerated  in a mental institution following her attempt to blow up a computer factory.

The film develops as an extended chase sequence with the Terminator now reprogrammed to protect John and another model  the T-1000 (Robert Patrick)  sent to kill the boy. The most dazzling special effect is the way the T-1000 morphs into various shapes, or when gaping holes in the cyborg simply seal themselves. These effects were never seen on screen before Terminator 2 and still pack a wallop. One of the lines closely associated with Schwarzenegger comes from this film  Hasta la vista, baby!  a catchphrase he picks up from John Connors bad-boy street lingo.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc 4K UltraHD/Blu-ray/Digital HD release include a 55-minute documentary containing an interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger, James Cameron, and Edward Furlong; 2 feature commentaries including 23 members of the cast and crew; the 30-minute featurette The Making of T2; 2 deleted scenes with audio commentary; and trailers.",1514332800,,1847,5.237288135593221
2131206,1,B0002WYTWG,I love this movie. the one star I gave this movie is for the 4k transfer. They did on this movie the colors  look washed out and dull. And you do not get the extended edition in 4k you only get the theatrical version on the 4k disc. and my blu-ray of this movie looks a hole lot better. then the 4k disc. And the sound on my blu-ray of this movie sounds better then the 4k disc. I think they did a horrible job with this release. My advice is if you all ready have this movie on blu-ray hold on to it. Tell a real 4k release comes out. Because the 4k transfer on this disc is the worst I have ever seen when it comes to 4k movies.,1514332800,,630,3.8091603053435112

To add insult to injury, the 4k transfer does not look good at all. Way too much DNR.

I would highly recommend that you avoid this version until they come out with a proper release.",1514332800,,537,4.316831683168317

The movie itself is an all time classic and still works, but this 4K transfer, especially during the daytime scenes falls way short of expectations. The imagery looks murky and dry at best. At times it felt like I was transported back in time to a crappy theater with low light levels during the 90's. I kept having to tweak my settings to get the image to pop, but to no avail.

First off, the 4K version is ONLY the theatrical cut and DOES NOT have 3 versions of the film. Second, The transfer is garbage.. absolute garbage! DNR makes Arnold look waxy and gives the motion a smeary quality where its used. There is NO EXCUSE for this with 4K and this is by far the worst looking 4K transfer. There are moments where this does shine but the DNR usage totally takes you out of the movie. The second Blu-Ray release (the one that came out after the Skynet edition) is better over all because it was remastered without DNR. If its true that James Cameron approved the 4K remastering, hes clearly lost his mind!",1514246400,,716,4.390977443609023

While i expected the 3D to only be for the theatrical, the special editions should have been converted for 4K. After seeing the special edition  debut years ago, it's hard for me to watch the theatrical. BUT I WOULD FOR 3D. Guess I'll wait for the imported All Regions 3D version, if that ever happens. On another note, Nolans 4K collection is superb!",1514246400,,495,4.43956043956044
2131216,5,B0002WYTWG,"Its a 2 disc package.  Disc 1 has the 4K JUST THE THEATRICAL version.  It looks amazing.  No visible grain what so ever which is slightly missed.  This looks like all noise has been eliminated.  Its a print struck from the 3D version mobody saw. The 4K opens with the titles THIS 3D version has been approved.  That was a distraction for a moment. Otherwise picture and sound are up a notch from Blu Ray but to be honest after putting in the accompanying blu Ray - did a side by side A/B and the 4K is really gorgeous but only a die hard  will really appreciate since the accompanying  blu Ray was struck from the same exact 3D negative. Menu is a little overly complicated but fine.

The blu Ray comes with some old commentary from Cameron and Writer William Wisher and its great - just. Not new - and last releases mini docs but not sure if there is anything new. Just some stuff ported over.  And not everything. No script/storyboard. I will correct that if Im wrong.  For the price you cant go wrong. If you already have the previous  blu Ray - there are some bemifits besides a much cleaner look - many of the gaffes have finally been fixed like the obvious stuntman faces in the alley crash em up - faces replaces by Real cast and it looks great.  Kind of blue-hues like the original remaster but I love it.  Blu Ray also includes every special

I have blurays that look better than some of their 4K counterparts.. My children love 3D movies.. Becasue their fun and enjoyable.. The look on their face is priceless... That look never appears while watching a 4K Ultra disc.. I enjoy watching both... Most often then not its hard to notice the increased resolution.. And a lot of the 4K disc look grainy.. LG had the best 3D ever using light weight passive glasses (same as the movie theater) without batteries or need for charging.. You don't even know your wearing them..

2131228,5,B0002WYTWG,"Excellent movie! This review will be more about the quality of the movie than the content. This BD comes with a Digital HD copy through VUDU or Fandango. I set it up with Vudu because its easier for me. As for the disc itself, it came exactly as described and shrink wrapped so I knew it was new. I thoroughly inspected the print on the front and back covers. Everything was pristine. I had ordered this same movie from a different source and you could immediately tell by the back cover that someone printed it from their computer and then the disc looked copied. Not in this case. This is definitely a legitimate, remastered BD. The picture and sound quality are excellent. This disc comes with both the Unrated Special Edition and the theatrical version. I prefer the theatrical version but the extended version is just as good in quality...just has some sequences that don't fit in my head. This movie was state of the art in 1991 and being remastered on Blu-Ray is even better. A must have for any Terminator fan, or even just action fans.

FYI, they sell Terminator movies in sets (Anthology or Quadrilogy). Dont buy those!!! The quality is terrible. I bought both and immediately returned them after trying each disc. The discs worked but the sound and picture quality was terrible. I bought it like that because the price was awesome for 4 movies (Genisys) wasn't included. Buy them individually. The quality is so much better. You won't regret it and the prices individually are still very reasonable for BD.

It seems that he is invincible and is targeting all the Sara Connors in the phone book. Each one being dispatched more violently than the last. A less robust being (Michael Biehn) also appears the same way. He too is seeking Sara.

What is so intriguing about Sara Connors (Linda Hamilton)?

Who will find her first?

The Terminator. If you are a lifetime action movie fan, this one is most likley in your top ten. This also could be Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie. The premise is pretty simple.

The humans also sent a human back, and he ends up being the generals father. That is the central paradox of the entire franchise. This one works on every level.

I get it. But as for Terminator 2: my history for T2 is as follows, I starting with: A laser disc, Then The Ultimate Collectors edition extended laser disc (some may remember that these were $100 discs. seriously..) then a DVD, then an extended cut DVD, then on to a new blu ray, then an extended directors cut blu ray. The Skynet blu ray edition, The Edward Furlong can't act edition. plus the metallic cover ultimate edition blu ray. We all know how great this movie is and it explains my embarrassingly stupid purchasing history, but no more!  Now the studio will reissue a 4K version, without the new 3D cut, and only the theatrical version on 4K. I didn't spend this much money on a 65"" OLED 4K 3D display and a 3D, 4K blu ray player with the latest up-converting technology so I can purchase half-assed 4K releases with more benefit on the enclosed standard blu ray disc, which I already own, than the new 4K disc. To all studios who offer only the theatrical cuts on 4K while the extended cuts reside on std. blu ray discs, sorry, not this time. I have purchased Terminator 2 too many times to settle for 2nd best. Thats too bad as I would have gone for it, but this offering completely misses the point of maximum 4K enjoyment. Now I am done with T2. Think of how many cuts and versions there are of ""the Martian"" (hint; at least 7) and that is only 2 years old..After all these years, the studio doesn't have a clue the huge success of T2 is almost wholly owed to the extended cut. Who do they think will be satisfied making yet another purchase, in 4K no less and be at all happy with no complete 4K presentation of the ground breaking classic? Isn't that the whole point? Good grief, take the hint from the fabulous Peter Jackson release of both cuts of King Kong in 4K.
Update comment 8/30/17: My understanding is that a 3D version will eventually be available in the US as a separate purchase. Lets hope it may be the extended cut, not like Cameron's 3D theatrical only release of Avatar or The Martian, or Suicide Squad, or World War Z or....

A dank, dark, horrific dystopian future comes crashing into a cute young woman's everyday life when a machine consciousness decides it's in its best interest to attempt a ""sort of retroactive abortion"". Bulging Arnold has never looked better in stunning almost HD visuals, Brad Fiedel's original score sounds like steel being forged, AND there's no whiny kid, over the top effects, prissy bad guy, or silly joking machine baby sitter to muck up the works!

We do, however, have a slight problem.

See, I had drinks after work and then rented this off of Amazon Prime only to discover that the best scfi horror movie ever made has been yet again ""remastered"" with fake new sound effects and color re-tenting. That's right! You are NOT seeing or hearing the original version of this movie.

Do you really think they made an AMT Hardballer long slide .45 sound like a silenced .22 in the theatrical release?

There are a lot of audio ""additions"" that I'm not cool with and the color tinting changes the tone of the movie just enough to burst my bubble. Also, ART SHOULDN'T BE MESSED WITH. This movie was and should be dark and blue and scary, not tinted for added warmth and appeal.

This one's definitely not for the kids, and Arnold is not your stand-on-one-leg buddy. He's a no-BS hyper-alloy killing machine with a collection of murder guns and very few lines. The story is rich, the characters are deep enough, and the action is non-stop. I think the best part is the gripping dark atmosphere. Watch it late at night, with the lights out, after a couple of drinks.

As of rating, I'd give it 4 with a minus. And this minus is just because of the love story-line, I thought it was out of place and was there just to serve the story. Sure, Kyle would need a motivation to make such a move and risk his life, going back in time to save someone's mother, but it's not like he has not had any other motivation or something to loose.
Anyway, it is not that big of a deal.
Oh, and one more issue is the tying things up with this whole ""John sends his father to make love with his mother"". There is just too much confusion and questions like ""well, how is that even possible, if Kyle would be dead in their time"". I don't mind goofy stuff at all, but there has got to be some logic and a proper explanation. This seemed like a false plot-part.

While I realize this is Used-Like New, why do they use the cheapest, stickiest stickers and apply them right to the plastic?? You cannot remove these without ruining the case, stretching out the plastic cover and leaving glue as well as pieces of the stickers..  A little shrink wrap couldn't hurt, nor cost much. The seller apparently does not care about the customer, only the money.

Also, where is the Face Plate? Item I selected was the one with the collectible face plate. I won't be buying used discs again, I guess.  There is also no Menu access with this.  I am able to access menus on other discs but not this one, so it is not my BD player.",1491177600,,762,4.414285714285715

2131411,5,B0002WYTWG,"No matter who says T2 outdoes this first film, Terminator 1 is Jim Cameron's most innovative, unique, and audacious film to date. Mistaken by silly Orion Pictures as a B movie, they afforded Cameron only a small budget. Utilising people like Gale Anne Hurd and Stan Winston to bring a nightmare about a cyborg from the future to life equaled an unexpected sleeper sci-fi thriller hit that I saw at the age of 14. Until this film, I had only ever been exposed to the standard ""John Wayne"" archetype hero. Don't get me wrong. Of course I like some of John Wayne's movies, but could I, a member of the queer community, an asexual, ever identify with him? Never. When I watched this movie, I got to know 2 heroes that are very human, vividly alive. At the beginning of this story, they are from different worlds, different times. By the end, they are like twins, exactly alike. They are the first, and last, in present day, to accept the truth about a looming apocalypse: a screaming, traumatised youth and a waitress/ college student who is abruptly yanked away from her mundane existence to flee from a merciless killer from the future. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his star-making performance as the titular ""villain"", relentless, unstoppable, murderous, but not evil, because after all, it is a machine, a program. The story is truly about the indelible Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese, a timid, unassuming Cold War era kid, and a scarred child soldier who has never before seen the world as it looks in present day. As they run from the machine, they both grow stronger and more human, as if that was possible. Kyle talks about a picture of Sarah, about how he always wondered what was on her mind while she wore a Mona Lisa smile, all the while wearing the very same smile himself. This film contains the only love scene I've ever been able to watch and not only keep my food down, but actually feel like it's integral to the plot, not to mention touching. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are really what make this film work. They bring heart and soul to what could easily have been a silly B movie. When ""Genisys"", as is WHY, came out, I went into a rage that other reboots didn't provoke, and I realised it's because I love and regard this ageless film so much. From the 2 characters who are both strong fighters and nurturing caretakers when their arcs are complete to Cameron's tight script and direction to Brad Fiedel's absolutely amazing cyberpunk score, this film is a masterpiece. 10/10",1489276800,,2493,4.642533936651584
2131412,2,B0002WYTWG,"This movie is little more than a protracted stalker film draped on a flimsy science fiction premise.  There's a lot of action, but very little that's thought provoking.  Maybe by 1980's standards it was innovative or edgy or something, but it really is nothing more than one long, protracted chase that get's tiresome.",1489276800,,318,4.981132075471698

2131421,5,B0002WYTWG,I personally like this one better than the first but it's a close tie. The kid that plays John Connor does an excellent job and pulls it off nicely. He seems to be acting normally like a kid his age would. The first two movies are quite thrilling but the third one left a lot to be desired.,1487289600,,290,4.017241379310345

2131457,4,B0002WYTWG,The cybernetic organism of Terminator I returns as a protector for John Connor.  Many of the scenarios of I are repeated but with enough of a twist to be fresh and exciting.  The reprogrammed Terminator must protect John and to a lesser extent Sarah Connor from a more advanced version of himself.  Added in is the possibility of of preventing the future destruction of mankind.  Action packed from beginning to end with just enough human interaction to make the characters appealing even the original Terminator is humanized by his relationship with John.,1482883200,,556,5.010869565217392

2131563,5,B0002WYTWG,"T1 has the best story, characters, drama and visions of a nightmarish future. It's far better than all the other terminator films. In T2 and T3 Arnold is a weak willed good robot that doesn't want to kill anyone, he only wants to help! He takes orders from humans like a slave.
In T1 Arnold is fantastic as the villain and shocked the world with his evil, sadistic ways and brutality. MIchael Biehn was amazing as the human that would do anything to stop the terminator, no matter what the cost. Linda Hamilton is good as the person caught in the middle, trying to figure out if this is all for real. Even the cops are good- confused and overworked, trying to figure out what's going on.
In T2 Arnold is outflexed and outmuscled by Linda Hamilton. In T3 he's put onstage on ladies night, then given a savage beating by a female terminator.",1474070400,,839,4.454545454545454

2131582,1,B0002WYTWG,"It's tiring seeing Arnold as the good guy when he's a much better villain. The terminator is a scary monster from a nightmarish future. It doesn't impress the ladies with its fathering skills, it doesn't bond with children. It kills humans, it doesn't take orders from them! The idea of the terminator protecting humans is silly. The terminator is turned into a joke. The ""terminator' says "" I swear i will not kill anyone."" Its like he's afraid to be bad, he might get in trouble. Linda Hamilton turns Arnold into her slave, giving him orders and treating him like dirt.
In T1 Arnold was fantastic as the villain and shocked the world with his evil, sadistic ways and brutality. He dominated your attention and made you want more.( Michael Biehn was amazing as the human that would do anything to stop the terminator, no matter what the cost. Linda Hamilton is good as the person trapped in the middle trying to figure out if this was all real. Even the cops are good- confused and overworked, trying to figure out what's going on.)
 Now, as in T3, Arnold is a ""terminator"" that doesn't want to kill anyone, he only wants to help!  He wants to know why humans cry and learns to smile. He takes orders from humans like a weak willed slave. Linda Hamilton flexed all the muscle and kicked all the a__, while Arnold stood in the background, too scared to even move a single giant muscle. She made him look weak, pathetic and spineless. Linda was the terminator in this film. She kicked so much a__ I thought she was going to give him a beating to. Linda is annoying as the angry freedom fighter.  No more nice girl. She turned into a angry militant with a hair trigger temper. She's muscled up and radiating with rage. She screams at, beats or shoots everyone she sees.  Arnold was very weak compared to her. Linda outmuscled Arnold and spewed hatred in every scene. Arnold was quiet and tame. She dished out a lot of savage beatings. The male nurses thought they were big men until Linda beat them, broke their bones and injected hazardous chemicals into their bodies. Now they need new faces. She had a blast. The policeman thought he was a big man too until Linda ordered him out of his cruiser and stole it. Of course Arnold was too weak to defeat the liquid metal terminator so Linda had to do it for the worthless male.
The only thing that stopped Lindas screams was a nuclear explosion in a dream sequence. She grabs a chain link fence and starts screaming as usual. Then a nuclear blast shreds her body apart as her screams of rage turn to screams of pain and agony.
Linda bossed Arnold around like he was a slave. The terminator kills humans, it doesn't and shouldn't take orders from humans like a weak willed puppet! Linda is hard, she wants to destroy and assassinate. Arnold is soft and kindhearted. He doesn't want to kill anyone. He wants to spend time with kids. Telling jokes and smiling? He doesn't want to be the terminator, he wants to be a good father ( figure). I don't know why Arnold is pretending to be the terminator, It's clear he wants to be a dad, not the terminator. The terminator is bossed around, in the end he almost cries!
Edward Furlong is so obnoxious, foul and disgusting as the child I found myself rooting for the evil liquid terminator the whole time.
Arnold cripples 2 men when they try to help a child in trouble. He tries hard to look bad, dressed up like a bad macho biker man, always riding a big motorcycle. A real robot wouldn't be concerned with keeping up a bad boy image.
The action is awesome but so unbelievable it makes me cry. The terminator is a stealth infiltration unit. But what does he do? He walks completely naked into a crowded public place, injures 3 men in full view of dozens of witnesses, then after stealing their clothes steals their ride in front of another witness. Nobody reports anything. Then he rides around like a maniac on a stolen motorcycle in broad daylight, causing accidents everywhere he goes. Nobody calls the cops again. Both terminators drive stolen vehicles across crowded traffic, off bridges and through walls firing away the whole time. Finally one of the vehicles blows up in a gigantic fireball. Nobody noticed or called the cops. Arnold doesn't make any effort to blend in, he craves attention as a human would.
The terminator fires thousands of rounds and never kills anyone! To make it more ridiculous- he uses assault weapons and guns designed for attack helicopters and still can't do it! He goes through giant duffel bags of ammo, has ammo strapped to every part of his body and can't do it. He makes a lot of noise and a big show but that's it. Do you like my big silly gun?
Linda meets a Mexican and bosses him around like slave. Of course he has a US Army supply store in his yard. He says "" You need guns? No problem! I got all the weapons and ammo you need! You want anything else I'll give it to you. No charge because we are amigos! You want my truck to? .. No problem!!  I got a garage you can use if you need it.. I got whisky, weed, food in the kitchen and eggs on the table for you! The bathroom is in the back... You want it all now?? ..Okay! I'll do anything for you..  Let me give you a hug while I'm at it.""
The only high point is Robert Patrick as the liquid metal terminator. He was sly, slick and cunning. He was excellent. Arnolds humiliation and punishment continue in T3, where  he's put onstage on ladies night, then the female terminator gives him a savage, humiliating beating.
In T2 a couple screams in horror when the terminators metal hand is revealed. they screamed and screamed and couldn't stop screaming until their lungs gave out. They dropped to their knees and sobbed. They screamed, they cried, they pounded their heads into the ground. That's what I did when I saw how bad T2 and T3 were. I had the same horrified look on my face too...",1473465600,,5868,4.463187325256291

2131596,4,B0002WYTWG,Anie seems to get all the praise for this movie but personally. I have to tip my hat to Michael Biehn...sorry if I misspelled the last name there. Michael played this role perfectly. I like that he was intense where he needed to be and was able to be seemingly more compassionate with Linda Hamilton when he was explaining to her that the terminator can't be reasoned with. He was strong there too but also very sincere and patient with her almost like he understood her fear and panic over what is happening. Michael is such a good actor. I'd really like to see him in more movies.,1473033600,,582,4.398148148148148

It's really a good lesson in global filmmaking.. There's very little dialogue for the first 30 minutes really.. and you can see how the genius of its production and marketing expanded upon a global market... Sure, there's a few logic plot holes in the story line.. but who cares... it was so clever and unique with the sci-fi... take away all that and its just a really good action crime drama.... Nice to see girls with big bushy hair dos again too... Linda Hamilton was is still such a babe",1470268800,,643,4.699115044247788
2131683,5,B0002WYTWG,I rented this movie not realizing it was a director's cut. There are deleted scenes in the movie that are pretty interesting and I think they add some pretty good context to the movie. It's also awesome to see Reese in this one again. It makes the action a little more spread out but I think it's worth it to see more story. If you don't care about extra scenes you may not care for it though. Linda Hamilton makes such a transition from the 1st movie to the second and her haunted performance in this one is eerie and very well done.

2131686,4,B0002WYTWG,"NOTE:  I am rating this VERSION of the movie, which would have gotten 5 stars if, when they re-mastered the audio, they didn't screw up some of the sound effects so bad.

Ahnult's long slide .45 now sounds like a cross between a 007 silenced PPK and a raygun, and during the police station shootout, the 12 gauge auto-loading shotgun occasionally has the automatic rifle fire SFX by mistake. They also screwed up the sound of the pipe-bombs in the tunnel, removing the realistic metallic echo and replacing it with a typical Hollywood explosion sound effect.

Other than those small gripes, the movie greatly benefited from the audio improvements, especially the future battle scenes, the band playing in Tech Noir as well as the Tech Noir shoot out, the police car chase scene (the parking garage really comes to life with the added ambience), and the musical score in general.

And as far as the original film itself, it will always be 5 stars in my book, especially considering what they did with a meager $6.4 million budget.",1470009600,,1029,4.764044943820225

My 12 year old commented that ""old movies"" are more about the story than the special effects and he likes that and thinks it's a better movie watching experience.  I felt old, but he's not wrong about the problem with special effects trumping story.  There are some bizarre example of egregious paternalistic sexism, such as a comment about ""our little Brenda"" (was it really like that in the 80s?!?  I guess it was, in film tropes at least, cf. Working Girl).  Overall, it's still a good film that holds up well.  Our family is watching movies based on the premise that an original which is good enough to start a franchise was probably a really good film...and generally that in not true for the rest of the franchise.  That's the theory.  We also watched Highlander recently, and it is also a far better movie than all its sequels.  Don't watch any sequels, just the originals that made the Hollywood powers want to make bad sequels:  I would recommend that as a way to choose films.",1469145600,,1024,4.607734806629834

Also, I appreciate the movie even more now because I recognize the places in LA where they shot the movie.

The story is great, the action is good, and it is nice to see Arnold young and powerful. The length of the movie is good too. Things move quite quickly. Not much gap in the story. Just slow police response time, which is still a problem in LA.

In terms of the Terminator series, I think Terminator 1 and 2, were the best and I think stopping there was probably the best. The new Terminator series do not seem to add much.",1468972800,,652,4.118110236220472

This movie proved what films could achieve with good acting, good directing, and good make-up artists.  They didn't need no stinking CGI.  Compared to its successors, The Terminator seems crude.  It's that crudeness that gives it the realism all the Terminator movies, sans T2, lack.  Man against machine.  The tension never lets up.  30+ years later, The Terminator still holds up as one of the most influential and potent sci-fi films of all time.",1468886400,,574,4.785714285714286

2132325,4,B0002WYTWG,"Most people know the story of this movie, because of the mountain of sequels and spin-offs it spawned. It was a relatively low budget movie, which shows at times, but it is still the best and most enjoyable one in my opinion.

It is also possibly the ultimate 80s movie. From the visual style to the clothes, music and hair, and the themes of technology and warfare, it's like a composite of everything that made the 80s what it was. Sometimes it feels like a video game, or an R rated GI Joe or Transformers cartoon from the time. The degree to which it influenced action/sci-fi movies for years afterwards can't be overstated.

But ultimately what makes this movie and the rest of the series stick is that it is possibly the most accurately predictive sci-fi story of recent times. In the years since, everything the premise is based on, with the exception of time travel, has become a legitimate possibility. The Internet, robotics and AI are all moving in directions that could plausibly produce the outcome predicted in the movie.

So what seemed like harmless entertainment at the time is actually something that should be watched and thought about by people dealing with the issues presented by modern technology. When you already have people being targeted by unmanned drones, connected and directed by networked computers,  all you need to do is throw in the wrong AI, and we are living in this world.",1466035200,,1410,4.766393442622951

and this time Lionsgate have decided to leave out the extra special edition version

the extra longer cut had extra scenes mainly of the T1000 exploring his environment, nothing very exciting
Lionsgate have also left out some of the extras from 2009 blu-ray
well Jim cameron's audio commentary has been removed for some reason
and the sound quality has been dropped down to 5.1 mix, not 6.1
so this new 2015 reissue only has 2 versions of the film
the usual Theatrical version & the usual 152min special edition version in both 2:35:1 ratio & both have 5.1 master audio mix
plus all the retrospective making of featurettes, different Theatrical trailers, TV spots, stills Photo Gallery

but different artwork which appears to be an image from the original poster artwork which i like better than the skynet artwork

It's also great because the special effects in this were noteworthy for its time.  Basically two men travel back in time.  One wants to stop a future war from happening, the other wants to ensure it happens.  Sarah Conner, is the key factor in preventing the war later, so the bag guy (Arnold, who is a robot) wants to kill her, and the good guy wants to keep her alive.  There is a ton of action, a little bit of love involved, and there are ZERO boring moments to this movie.  It is fast-paced immediately.  Love this movie!",1462320000,,643,4.162601626016261
2132738,5,B0002WYTWG,"NOTE: I put it as 5 stars as this is my first time owning this film. I only borrowed the Skynet edition with my friend.
The movie: This movie is one of the sequels that is better than it's predecessor with better character development, great story, and the CGI that holds up really well, compare to the modern films.

Picture: While this is the best this movie has ever looked on home video for now (until James Cameron properly remastering the film and re-release on theaters in 3D, ""-from high resolution 35mm original film elements""), it still uses the same master as previous releases (film film scratches still appears). If they re-release it for the fourth time, they need to remaster the film by using the 4K or 8K mastering and contains all the special features for the previous releases on Laserdiscs, DVDs, and Blu-rays (including the Skynet Edition) plus having three different versions on different discs. Make it release on both Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD!!

Audio: The audio for this reissue looks like a sightly downgraded to the Skynet Edition on 6.1 DTS-HD Master Audio to 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, it still sounds really good like it's Skynet lossless soundtrack.

Extras: For the extras however, it's bareboned. The special features for the 2015 re-release is:
-""The Making of T2"" Featurette (Ported from the 1991 Collector's Edition Laserdisc which is later ported to the 1993 Special Edition Laserdisc and ""The Ultimate Edition DVD"")
-""T2: More Than Meets the Eye"" Featurette (Ported from the 1993 Special Edition Laserdisc which is later ported to ""The Ultimate Edition DVD"")
-""No Fate but What We Make"" Featurette (Ported from Extreme DVD)
-T2: On-the-Set Montage (Ported from Extreme DVD)
The only missing is most extras from both the ""Ultimate Editon"" and ""Extreme"" DVDs such as audio commentaries, Special Extended Edition (due to space limitations for increasing bitrates), trailers, DVD-ROM features for the Extreme edition like Infiltration Unit Simulator and T2 FX Studio, and Skynet Combat Chassis Designer (due to been outdated), several features from the Skynet edition (Picture in Picture, Storyboard-script mode, quizzes and games, plus the useless BD-Live), etc.

Verdict: If you owned the previous releases, you have to proceed with caution or it better to wait for the fourth release (James Cameron remastering the film ""-from high resolution 35mm original film elements"") by using the 4K or 8K mastering and contains all the special features for the previous releases on Laserdiscs, DVDs, and Blu-rays (including the Skynet Edition) plus having three different versions on different discs.

2132761,5,B0002WYTWG,"This movie is a classic for a reason. It's, like, a prophetic vision of our increasing struggle to retain our humanity amid ever-more intelligent machines and ever-more powerful artificial entities. The special effects hold up surprisingly well, and no matter how many times I watch this (and we are talking dozens of times), I'm always completely caught up in the story.

The whole series is like that, at least to some degree. We - the viewers - know that it represents a version of the truth that the path we are on is unsustainable. We have known it since the 80s - before, even. The message speaks to us. But the way it does it: brilliant, exciting, breathtaking, thrilling - never gets old.",1461456000,,696,4.658536585365853

Now, Sarah and Reese are on the run from the Terminator, looking for weapons to fight it, and trying to stay away from the police, who want to save Sarah from Reese. The Terminator will never stop, and will let nothing stand in its way to terminate Sarah Connor!

This 1984 movie was the start of the whole Terminator franchise. Its a great movie, with some really hardcore action. The story is really tight, keeping the tension going almost from the very start to the very end. Arnold Schwarzeneggers dry and serious acting style captures the killer android perfectly, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.

Now, as the R rating suggests, this is not a movie to watch with the kids. But, as a guys night movie, its nothing short of superb! Hats off to the one and only Terminator!",1460592000,,971,4.6395348837209305

So, you press cancel and it goes through about 5 minutes on ""can't find"". Then you have to press guide (by the way no instructions came with this) to get to the actual movie.

2132960,4,B0002WYTWG,"I would give this movie 5 stars for total brilliance but the horrible acting by Edward Furlong just can't allow me to do that.  I hear this kid was found on a playground, but they should have left him there and humanely covered up in the sand box.  Throughout the movie we struggle through Furlong's struggling through his own lines as well as the struggle to keep his voice from constantly cracking when he shouts (and he shouts a lot). There are too many young actors that could have played the part of John Conner so much better, but Furlong's horrible performance is a major distraction to an otherwise brilliant movie. It's not often that a sequel out does the original, but T2 more than accomplishes that task.  The effects are great, Schwarzenegger is as good as he CAN be, and I have no trouble buying into the ""Sara Conner"" character.  The action is superb and it very seldom comes up for air unless to fill in some plot holes as to why there's even a Terminator in the first place... much less 2 of them.

The film was awesome because protecting john conner is the key to protect the future also a ""fixed point"" in the time Continuum also it was cool to see the T-101 in a more empathic role rather than a machine who outs to kill also the T-1000 is one the best Cinematic Villains Robert Patrick did a great Job on portraying the Ice-Cold Terminator also Amazing Production Design by Joseph Nemec III(Twister), Cinematography By Adam Greenberg(Ghost), Costume design by Marlene Stewart(Oblivion) and Direction By James Cameron(Aliens) The Best out of All The Terminator Series T2 is truly a great Science Fiction and Movie 8/10",1451952000,,1259,4.971563981042654

but, if you are looking for the 2015 Terminator: Genisys movie, this is not it.

First: It's like you are covering up a older version of the movie you had stored somewhere. Second: the outer DVD case is damaged when you remove the card! If this is some kind of cad collection ,you should place the card inside the DVD case. I removed the outer card off my DVD case now the plastic shield on the DVD case has stretch marks the outer case. I personally hate damaged equipment and I will be replacing this case very soon.

2133131,4,B0002WYTWG,"A pretty good follow up to The Terminator (1984) . It, of course, has a bigger budget, ""better"" effects, eschewing stop motion for the more current (at the time) CGI (though still has plenty of puppetry,) more expensive music and overall production.
I could not help, even at the time thinking the original was a superior film.

This go around I saw the Director's Cut, which I thought was pretty good, more fleshed out than the theatrical version, although at one point they keep spelling out the plot of the first movie unnecessarily.
The CGI elements don't hold up as well*, but are probably used to their best advantage despite their limitations. The story is basically a re-telling of the first movie, just bigger, louder and more expensive, but also not as emotionally economical.
Cameron does allow for a bit more character development. The plot throws some elements from the first movie out and ignores others: the story was already settled, but somehow we need to make it again, organics are not required for time travel, etc.

Speaking of time travel, the sequel actually re-sets time & history, so if there should be complaints that the further chapters do it, this is actually where that problem starts. Also, in regards to the time travel aspects, there are some other problems (although these go back to the first movie, detailing them more in the sequel only exacerbates them.)
The main problem I see is that the origin of all of these sequences originates in the future when it would logically be required to originate in the present/past: The Terminators are built in the future from technology developed in the present from a chip brought from the future. Just what is the origin of this technical information?

It doesn't help either that the intent of the story is to further erase these events, thus if the plot is successful then there is even less reason for this technical information to survive or exist. What should happen is that the first domino should be fixed an unalterable, so that at least there is that one certain thing, but without that there is no stable foundation for any event (this is kinda the point that the movie attempts to make all along, except that it keep insisting that the future is fluid, whereas what we see onscreen indicates to us that the past is equally fluid.)
Frankly I don't really have a problem with any of it, but it still makes me want to discuss it or comment on it. Actually what the events in the movie point out is that the movie itself has no clue about the nature of time, even while it attempts to clear up for us what that is.  In this Terminator space/time continuum whatever movie or TV show made after the first one should not even bother - they just cannot be that kind of carefully built science fiction since even while erasing one possible future they must allow for other similar futures to still exist and keep intruding upon the past. Past and future history is now a mess and it is likely to remain so.

Anyway, the film is probably closer in sensibility to the type of film Cameron apparently intended to make all along so it does have a slightly different flavor (The Terminator is now good - despite being b-b-b-b-ad to the bone, it doesn't kill people & the movie is a tearjerker now,) but it is still a pretty good action film and is a worthy follow up to T1.

*Aside from problems of animation like fluidity and reflection, the logistics of man built of liquid/solid metal never quite work: How massive or heavy is he? Could a speeding car or motorcycle or a flying helicopter not have a problem with this? Could he really disappear unnoticed over a floor without (literally) spreading too thin? Etc.",1447891200,,3689,4.641653905053599
2133132,4,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator used to be an astronomical term. This is the film that changed all of that, at least in the mind of the general public.

This is a very low budget effort, obvious in the music and some legendary ""bad"" effects (the effects are not really bad, it's just that Cameron made some bad choices in regards to them: angle and length of time before the camera, too much lighting, etc. They are showcased, when maybe they should have been used more subtly.)

The plot and elements are also derivative of Westworld, the Planet of the Apes series and the Outer Limits' Soldier & Demon with a Glass Hand episodes, in addition to light Biblical undertones which end the end don't amount to much.
It nevertheless managed to become a neat little cult item and ultimately became a franchise encompassing themes parks, movies, TV, etc.

A lean, efficient, unpretentious, fun little nugget of 80s movie gold that still works on its own terms.

Recommended.

2133341,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2: Judgement Day is one of the greatest and most influential action films of all time. There's not much more I can say about this fine film that hasn't already been said many times over. My review will focus on the merits of Lionsgate 2015 bluray release and how it stacks up to the previous two North American bluray releases.
T2's original release on bluray was in the very beginning days of the format. The transfer was extremely subpar to say the least with compression artifacts all around and clumpy grain along with poor colors. The film would get a 2nd bluray release as the Skynet edition which attempted to correct all of the errors with the poor picture quality of the initial bluray release. While they did manage to do just that, they also applied a bit too much digital noise reduction to the image which stripped away all of the film grain and giving the film an artificial waxy appearance in certain shots. It didn't approach the horrible DNR levels of the original Patton bluray or the Predator Ultimate Hunter Edition but it still was noticeable.
The new 2015 bluray release surprised a lot of people in that Lionsgate did a brand new encoding of the film. The Skynet edition utilized the VC-1 encoding format with the bit rate getting up to around 27 mbps in busy sequences. The new 2015 bluray release was encoded with the superior AVC format with a higher bit rate getting up to almost 40 mbps so that immediately allows an improvement in picture quality. The most important aspect of the new transfer is that film grain was restored to the picture. This along with the higher bit rate really shows a noticeable uptick in fine detail throughout the film. Colors are also more natural looking in the new transfer as well. So even though Lionsgate could have just gone the easy route of repackaging the Skynet edition transfer, I am happy that they didn't go that route.
You'll need to hold onto the Skynet edition in terms of extras including the commentary track however as the new bluray has an almost completely different set of extras. You also get both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film though the secret ultimate cut on the Skynet edition wasn't ported over.
So kudos for Lionsgate giving this film the best transfer to date and well worth the double (or triple) dip for T2 fans.",1441238400,,2327,4.650485436893204

Because even though  I use to own the Skynet ED.
I felt the Skynet BD was way over kill with a far too complex menue system.
And I never liked the DNR that was used in the Skynet BD.
This release is far superior. It loads a lot faster/the menue system is straight forward.
And the Video transfer offers a very nice grain structure.
Which belongs their. And is true to the 35mm film elements.
And fore a film fan like me that's very very importent.!!!!!
By theway I also like the DTS MA 20 channel headphones options.

2133414,2,B0002WYTWG,"I recently bought the special edition box set for T2, one of my all time favorite movies. I was so excited about getting this because it featured scenes I had never seen before in the movie. Then I go to turn on the movie, figuring I can just click on the menu to begin the special extended edition version, the longest of the three featured and the one with the most additional footage. I come to find out only two options are given, there's no option to run the third and longest version of the film. After doing some research I find out there's a special code you need to enter to play it! (What idiot that programmed this DVD set thought that was a good idea?) So I typed in the code multiple times step by step and still no special extended edition pops up. So I basically paid for a product which only gives me part of what I was looking for. I guess it isn't too bad, because I still get to see the regular special edition after all, but still I'll never be able to see that ""alternate ending"" for it now. Sorry DVD manufacturers, but you get a two star for thinking it was a good idea to have an easter egg hunt on a DVD menu.",1439337600,,1134,4.112612612612613

2133486,5,B0002WYTWG,"This movie picks up 10 years after the first one, and we get to meet John Conner (Edward Furlong).  Unfortunately, he is living with a foster family that hates him since him mom, Sarah (Linda Hamilton), is in a mental hospital for sharing and acting on the events of the first film.

Even worse, two more terminators are coming back from the future to try to kill John Conner so he will not be able to lead the uprising against the machines in the future.  While one is the old model that Sarah encountered in the past (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the other is a new upgrade that can heal and disguise himself as anything or anyone (Robert Patrick).  Which one will find John first?  Will Sarah get free of the mental hospital in time to help her son?

This movie is an action movie, pure and simple.  Since most of the story takes place in the (then) modern world of 1991, much of it plays out as pure action.  Yes, two of the main characters are unstoppable robots, but really, how are they that different from the typical action hero?  No, really.

And those action scenes are tons of fun.  There are some chases in pretty unique places around LA, where the film is set, and they keep you riveted to the screen.

Yet the story actually holds together better than a typical action movie.  In fact, theres a great twist to the story in the first half.  Sadly, its such a part of pop culture most people know what it is already, but if you do go into the movie unspoiled, youll really enjoy it.  I enjoyed watching it play out even though I knew what was coming.  There is one part of the story that feels a little forced in the second half, but I soon got on board and it sets up a wonderful climax.

Earlier I dismissed the science fiction aspect of the film, and now Im going to contradict that.  After all, time travel does play an import part of the story.  Yes, the movie does fall into the typical time travel traps, but its easy to ignore that because the film is so much fun.  While the movie is at its heart an action film set in 1991, the science fiction elements do give it something that makes it stand out from the others and make it something special.

The special effects actually stand up pretty well almost 25 years later.  Our glimpse of the future looks much better than the original, thats for sure.  The more advanced of the terminators sets up the need for some pretty advanced effects for 1991.  Today, wed think nothing of it, but back then it was jaw dropping stuff.  Honestly, knowing how advanced they were for the time, I find them pretty impressive today.

The acting is top notch as well.  Yes, it is an action movie, but we get some slower moments that develop the characters, and the actors hit those out of the park as well.  Schwarzenegger is the only exception since shes still a little robotic, but since hes playing a robot programmed to kill, it works.

So if youve missed this film like I had, youll want to fix that today.  This is fun escapism, and if thats what you are in the mood for, youll be glad to you sat down to watch this film.",1437436800,,3075,4.325174825174825

Cool tidbits about The Terminator:
- Schwarzenegger tried to avoid Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn as much as possible since the Terminator was trying to kill them, not form connections.
- The initial draft for the movie was sold to James Cameron's wife for the price of $1
- Schwarzenegger's famous debut line 'I'll be back' was originally scripted as 'I'll come back'

2133508,5,B0002WYTWG,"It is definitely an upgrade from the first but it has some loops. Some logical questions arise. Regardless on this though, for the time when it was created, as a story, developed from present to future, it is timeless and it will always be remembered. Beyond doubt it inspired a lot of latter movies of this category although mostly they look like flash forward brain bombardment with visual and audio effects. At the end you don't even know what exactly you saw. Terminator is totally different. T-1000 for example was amazing. The images of him dripping into shapes ore weapons are forever imprinted in my brain. Didn't this inspire a lot of recent creations with shapeshifters?!

2133518,5,B0002WYTWG,"I  do  like  this  movie.  &  I  understand  only  too  well  why  Arnold  wanted  the  role  for  the  criminal.  If  it  had  have  been  someone  not  very  muscular  like  him  it  wouldn't  have  been  a  good  show.  I  like  his  strategy.  He  was  sent  back  to  destroy  Sara Connor  (Linda Hamilton)  so  that  she  could  not  give  birth  to  John Connor  the  future  marine  leader  against  the  terminators.  Sara  lives  in  a  apartment  &  has  a  roommate  Ginger.  Sara  works  at  a  nearby  caf  as  a  waitress.  Kyle  (Michael Biehn) was  sent  back  to  protect  Sara.  Both  of  them  must  avoid  the  human  like  cyborg,  He  has  already  killed  2  other  women  named  Sara Connor  both  possibly  related  to  the  original  Sara Connor.  This  movie  to  me  is  a  lot  of  fun  to  watch, not  only  in  the  evenings  after  work  but  just  about  any  time  of  the  day.  The  101  model  is  very  hard  to  spot  &  has  blood  bad breath,  looks  human.  &  he's  not  a  robot.  Until  he's  stopped  nobody  is  safe.  Kyle  &  Sara  must  stay  a  step  ahead  of  him  in  order  to  survive!  &  the  police  station  looked  pretty  trashed  &  deserted  after  the  terminator  cleaned  house  while looking  for  Sara.  The  villain  can  also  impersonate  other  peoples  voices.  That's  what  I  like  about  the  movie.  Kyle  also  tells  Sara  about  his  past  back  there  in  the  future  fighting  the  terminators.  Women  &  Children  appear  to  be  homeless,  No  shelter  or  nothing  hardly.  &  its  Sargent  Kyle's  job  to  protect  them!  Its  not  a  future  I'd  want  to  live  in.
Fire  will  not  stop  the  terminator  &  its  pursuit  of  Sara  &  Kyle.  All  the  fire  did  was  burn  away  the  human  skin  &  tissue,  then  revealing  the  terrifying  cyborg  even  scarier  then  when  it  looked  human!  Only  Kyle's  dynamite  canister  things  slow  him  down.  Soon  Kyle  dies  unexpectedly,  Now  Sara  must  finish  the  job  &  flatten  the  cyborg  in  a  hydraulic  press.
With  this  terminator  destroyed  Sara  can  now  look  forward  to  having her  son  John,
The  movie  makes  very  good  sense,  all  this  seems  like  it  happened  in  a  single  night!  Many  deaths,  &  both  of  them  running  for  their  lives!
Absolutely  A  Terrific  Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!

2133575,4,B0002WYTWG,"This film mostly takes place in 1984 as we follow waitress Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton).  She is shocked to find that two other women with her name have been killed recently.  What she does not know is that she is the ultimate target by a Terminator (Arnold Schwartzenegger), a robot disguised as a human, sent from the future specially to kill her.  Why?  Because in the future her son John will lead the humans in a fight against the machines that have risen up and taken over the planet.

Sarahs only ally is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier also from the future who has come back to protect her.  But with an enemy that is actually a killing machine, is there any way to stop the Terminator?

I must confess that this past weekend was the first time Id seen this or any film in the franchise.  I certainly enjoyed it, although it took a few minutes to get past the 80s trappings.  The film wallows in everything that was 80s at the time, so be prepared for that as you go in.

I think what surprised me the most is how much the structure of the film borrowed from that of a slasher film.  No, the deaths aren't as bloody or creative and the film isn't as scary overall, but you have an unstoppable killer and the final girl.  The climax definitely drives the similarities home.

Still, this is an enjoyable film.  The acting is great, and the practical effects for the scenes in the 80s are realistic.  (The stuff in the future?  Lets just say dated and move on).  The characters are drawn well, so we really do care about the outcome.

So if you, like me, have missed out on this franchise, go back to the beginning and watch this.  Once you get past the 80s vibe, youll definitely enjoy it.",1436054400,,1702,4.346031746031746

2133590,5,B0002WYTWG,"An outrageous concept, but I loved it.  And I loathe time-traveling films, books, et cetera.

The concept is intriguing.  But you can have a great concept and a great story, and if the characters are not stellar, then you can't sell the story.  And the characters sold this story.

Linda Hamilton as the nave, clumsy, unaware Sarah Connor is just terrific.  She is attractive but not beautiful.  You recognize that she just hasn't found herself.  That there is so much more to her, but she doesn't know it yet.  That said, even we (the audience) have no inkling of just how strong she is.  When we meet her, she is in a staid waitress uniform having a bad day:  frizzy hair, rude customers, late for work, et cetera.  Then later that night, her date cancels on her.  You never meet her date.  But that is the beauty of Sarah Connor.  She just lifts herself up.  She won't wait around.  She is already dressed. She decides to go out anyway  treating herself to a whole pizza pie.

It is Sarah Connor's spirit that makes her so beautiful.  And you see how others act around her.  Her roommate likes her.  So does her boyfriend.  Even the  customers at the restaurant are observant rather than mean.  You cant help but sympathize with her.

You get Kyle Reese, who savors one photograph of her.  (My goodness, I found this so beautiful.)  After a hard day  shootings, death, he takes out a picture of her.  She was his reward, the real reason he keeps fighting.  Yes, there was the resistance but there is also her.  His son (John Connor) must have known that he (Kyle Reese) would be his father, which is why he was chosen, given that photograph of her.  Then seeing it burn.  It was utterly heartbreaking.  Kyle Reese was in love.  Already committed.  And that was before he has even met the real Sarah Connor.

Kyle Reese only wants to protect her.  Sarah Connor doubts him, but she is touched.  But he is the only who can protect her.

The scene prefacing the sex scene is somewhat awkward, because it is so earnest, but still, it was touching.  I wish it wasn't so painful maudlin.  (As this film proves, women are stronger than the sentimental, and some abhor the sentimental.)

But the scene afterwards is when I long for NC-17, because shouldnt the conception of John Connor be epic?  Dont get me wrong.  The scene was good.  It was definitely sexy.  But it should have been more.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as The Terminator.  No feeling. Weird accent.  Completely intent on his mission.  He was phenomenal.

I haven't seen the newest addition to the Terminator franchise, but this is my favorite.  Even more than Terminator 2:  Judgment Day despite its special effects.

Love this movie.  Crazy enough:  one of my favorite romantic films.",1435622400,,2752,4.602910602910603

2133592,5,B0002WYTWG,"Watch it for the love of T1. There are some great embedded references that you will appreciate. But one thought on feminism - we all know that Hamilton's Sarah Connor helped pave the way for female action film heroes. But it's still the male white action figure that saves everyone in the end of this storyline. As a sign of the film's social context, one cannot entirely hold that against the filmmakers or film. I mean, kudos to Cameron for presenting a no nonsense, tough female survivor. And it's pretty hard not to enjoy watching the T-800 take on the father figure role while saving the world.

Another thought - the future warring John Connor in the beginning of the film (in the dystopic future of 2029) is striking. He shows the physical scars of war, just like Biehn's Kyle Reese did in T1. Too bad this Connor is only shown briefly.

Found my way back to this classic via streaming video.",1435622400,,899,4.54320987654321

2133594,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 takes place 10 years after the events of the first Terminator film. John Connor has been born and is now a rebellious10 year old, living with foster parents. The reason? Not too long after John was born, Sarah Connor began preparing him through his childhood for his role as the leader of the human resistance against Skynet. However, during the middle of her training for him, she attempted to blow up a computer factory and was arrested and committed to a mental hospital.

Sarah is under the supervision of psychiatrist, Dr. Peter Silberman and is not the same timid woman she was in the first film. Sarah is now characterized as a more fearless, muscled, aggressive warrior like-woman. She constantly finds herself battling Silberman as well as his crooked assistants that occasionally abuse her.

Because the T-800 in the first film failed to stop Sarah from giving birth to John, they sent another model back in time to now kill John. The cyborg, dubbed the T-1000, is an advanced, faster, and more dangerous model that is made of mimetic-polly alloy, allowing it to transfer into almost anything it touches. With T-1000 after young John, future John reprogrammed the T-800 back to 1995 with the T-1000 to keep him safe. After John and T-800 break Sarah out of the asylum, they go on the run from the police and from the T-1000 on a mission to to destroy the Cyberdyne Systems once and for all to prevent Judgment Day from happening

Overall: Terminator 2 simply put is one of the best sequels of all time. T2 had twice the action and twice the fun that the first Terminator did. It was interesting to see them make Arnold the good guy and savior this time, battling another Terminator, rather than just bringing him back as the villain going after the Connors. There are comical elements thrown in at certain times but they're careful not to overdo it and stick to the action nature of the plot. Unfortunately Terminator 3 didn't get the memo....but that's another review for another time. The computerized 90s technology effects they included in the film were just amazing as it almost seemed as if this were filmed later on in the 90s or early 00s and not 1991. One of the best scenes of the film would probably have to be where Sarah dreams of Judgment Day and they show her being burned to death by the wave of fire that engulfs the city as she hangs on to the fence. Graphic but very artistic. The bonds formed in this film are very touching as well. We get John/Terminator, John/Sarah, and Terminator/John/Sarah. The friendship formed between John and Terminator was nicely scripted and at times--mainly towards the end, emotional at how a kid befriended a machine. In addition, the acting was on point from everyone. Arnold puts on yet another great performance as the Terminator and we see him develop more of a humanistic side throughout the film. Linda Hamilton kills her role as Sarah Connor, transforming into an intense, angry, and aggressive woman compared to her more quiet and innocent demeanor in the first film. Everything she does, every time she speaks in the film, it's with conviction and pure emotion. Edward Furlong delivers in his debut film as the rebellious and hard-headed 10 year old. Robert Patrick deserves a gold star for his performance as the T-1000. He plays the part almost too well at the cold, calculating, heartless machine. Not to mention he's just a downright creep in the movie. The way he looks, the way he walks, the way he talks, and the way he runs. ESPECIALLY the way he runs. There are 1 or 2 grievances about the film but it's nothing that takes away from the movie itself so I won't talk about it.

I highly recommend buying the Artisan Extreme DVD version of Terminator 2. So many great features on a 2 disc set for any fan of the film. The first disc you get the movie that also includes commentary from the director as well as side notes that greatly detail how they went about doing special effects and certain scenes. The second disc contains a documentary on the making of the film that includes interviews with the filmmakers and visual effects artists, footage of on the set shooting, and so much more. Overall, Terminator 2 is one for the ages and one you HAVE to own on DVD",1435536000,,4253,4.659121171770972

2133596,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is the historical, classic, impeccable 1984 beginning to the Terminator series, directed by the mastermind behind the Terminator, James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton

Sarah Connor is just a young waitress who's working to get by in life, but she has no idea of the future that lies ahead for her. Two entities from the year 2029 are sent back in time to the year 1984 in Los Angeles. One is an unstoppable Terminator T-800 model cyborg programmed to assassinate Sarah by any means necessary. The other being is Kyle Reese, a human resistance fighter sent to protect her from the Terminator.

Sarah is baffled and somewhat fearful when she sees on the news that numerous women in the LA area with the same first and last name as her are being killed by someone. It's not until her first confrontation with the Terminator and Kyle does everything fall into place to her understanding. In the near future an artificial intelligence defense network, Skynet, will become self-aware and initiate a nuclear apocalypse of the human race a.k.a. Judgment Day. Sarah learns that the reason she's being targeted by Terminator is because she will give birth to a son, John, who will be the savior of humanity, rallying the surviving humans to form a resistance movement against Skynet.

With the Resistance close to victory, Skynet desperately send the T-800 Terminator model back in time to kill Sarah, ensuring that John is never born to save mankind. Kyle is there to save her and kill the Terminator to ensure the survival of mankind. With the unstoppable and seemingly indestructible Terminator in hot pursuit, Kyle and Sarah team up to destroy the Terminator before it destroys them

Overall: The Terminator was one of the first movies I saw coming up as a kid and it has remained one of my all time favorites to this very day. Back during a decade where robot movies were a highly popular thing, the best thing to perhaps ever come from that genre was The Terminator. If you're telling me that an emotionless robot in human flesh decked out in a leather jacket, leather pants, boots, and gargoyles, chasing after someone with multiple guns on foot and on a motorcycle doesn't interest at least a little bit, you're lying to yourself. They couldn't have picked anyone better than Arnold Schwarzenegger to play this role. Arnold, who had played good guys in his films before Terminator, really absorbs the role as the cold and calculating villainous Terminating machine and delivers with such a smooth appeal, it makes you really appreciate the fact that Arnold got the role over OJ Simpson. Yes, OJ Simpson was originally considered to play the part of the Terminator and considering how controversial his name has been since the 90s, the reputation of this movie wouldn't have been a good one had he been the main character. Another thing I really love about The Terminator is how it's almost a horror film over a sci-fi thriller. Watching this the first time around and even still to this day, it seems to carry more horror elements (in my opinion anyway) than thrills. But that's not to take away from the amazing action-packed story. Once the chase gets going, there's gun fights, high speed chases, car crashes, and everything else to suit your action crazed thrills. And to top it all off, we get an incredible chilling soundtrack to get your emotions and nerves going with every intense scene this film has to offer. Overall, The Terminator is perfection on every level and is a gem in its own right that will forever be etched in pop culture as an American favorite.",1435449600,,3614,4.814814814814815

2133611,4,B0002WYTWG,"If you've seen the first Terminator movie, and at this point who in America hasn't besides puppies and children, you know what you're in for: A quest narrative that twists and grinds towards its inevitable ending; the well-armed, muscular yet strangely boyish, former governor of California matching stride for stride the enormous fire power and inexorable will of a dewy-eyed former waitress who has become a sinewy Goth; and a whiny John Connor flapping his arms like a duck trying to take off as he screams for Mom or Arnold to come save him. (He is handy at popping the hood of an ATM or breaking the code at the gates of Cyberdyne, though.) The bad-guy, robo-cop who is chasing John, Linda, and Arnold (who has suffered a major change of heart since the first Terminator movie), cracks his neck a lot as he sloughs off bullets and impersonates John's mother, an asylum security guard at a coffee machine, and even Linda Hamilton in the interminable (where's the Terminator when you need him?!) final scene. He's a new Adam-12-style cop-bot, a latterday Morpheus. This cop-bot is a new, cybernetic organism designed to kill, an upgraded Terminator with new and unsettling powers. Emotionally and physically, however, this robo-cop has just two settings, or an acting range from A to B (as Pauline Kael once said of Tom Cruise). He either is shape-shifting, melting, and reconstituting himself, or he's running like the robo-sprinter he is, arms pumping like pistons. (Why doesn't he just fly?) The film is basically one long chase scene, bad guys chasing good guys, until key characters meet their bitter end in the smelter.

Comparing the bad guy/cop-bot to the original Arnold Schwarzenegger kegorater/terminator/flying,crying death machine, is like comparing a Ferrari to a WWI tank. Schwarzenneger's Terminator was the old Hummer that splashed through rivers and crunched over small trees without ever faltering, its front fender encumbered by a giant winch, presumably to pull the more ordinary vehicles out of the mud. Cop-bot Terminator in Term II, ""Judgement Day,"" is able to become any living thing he touches if it is of roughly the same mass. He also has a disturbing ability to reconstitute himself after any assault whether from bullets, bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, or ice machines.

Whatever they throw at him, Cop-bot continues his monomaniacal chasing down of John Conner and his Eastern European Terminator sidekick, Arnold, Whether John is rescuing his mother from the psychiatric hospital or dodging bullets in a videogame arcade, John faces repeatedly faces Cop-bot and tries to bring him down. (Otherwise he'll never be able to sleep at night again.)

In the last scene, for far too long Linda, John, the cop-bot, and Arnold slalom between giant moving parts of factory die-cutters and syncopated hammers slamming down, as they slip up and down metal staircases, conveyer belts, and all the other moving parts in a factory that seems half pinball machine and half 3D printer.

Basically, this film is a crude version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" with John Connor starring as a post-apocalyptic Frodo who, instead of trudging to Mordor, sprints alongside the monosyllabic Arnold all the way to the smelter. And just as Frodo hesitated at the crucial moment in which he was to hurl the mythic Ring into the fires of Mordor, a hesitation that prompted Gollum's spring towards his pretty Ring and their tandem expiration, so do John and Arnold find their way to the fiery pits and hot stew of metals brewing in a factory at the end of the Road, where each one has his own part to play, too.

So, spoiler alert, in the last minutes of the film Arnold realizes he must self-immolate, but his schematics are such that he cannot do so on his own. So at the lip of this post-Tolkien firepit, Arnold stops. But a sweaty Linda Hamilton (who in real life has been on a high-protein, low-fat diet, and working out four-plus hours every day for a year, extra-camera) limps to the smelter and pushes him in.

I didn't think this was quite as good as the first Terminator movie, but it's still pretty damn good for its originality, the ways in which the beginning of this film messes with those of us who saw the first film, and its reliable formula of ""people-in-jeopardy"" (peep-jeop?) who must be saved or the whole Earth (including every child on every playground in the world) will go to hell in a handbasket. Watching Linda Hamilton drag her bloody, shattered leg through the factory, wincing every time its bloody wound is aggravated by stair or robot but still carrying on, propelled by an instinct more maternal than heroic, is absolutely wonderful stock footage enlivened by Hamilton's off-the-charts shrieks and grimacing as she bounces her wounded body up or down a stair--and away from Adam 12. Seeing Linda Hamilton snarl her rage, her eyes little circles of insanity protruding under her mane of sweat-soaked, dripping wet hair; and all her damp efforts to kill the cop-bot, made the price of admission thoroughly worth it.",1434758400,,5050,4.94228504122497

Does anyone really need a plot synopsis of this film? I can't imagine there are too many people new to this series or story, and even someone seeing this film for the first time probably already knows the basic idea. Mankind is nearly wiped out in the future by machines, but a leader emerges that unites the survivors to fight back against the machines. In order to stop this leader the machines send back a terminator, a robot designed specifically to kill a specific target, in this case the leader's mother, Sarah Conner. The human send back someone as well, someone to protect Sarah from the mechanized killer.

I think what I like best about this film, is that it's a sci-fi film wrapped up in the trappings of an 80's slasher horror film. When you get down to it, there are very few differences between The Terminator and Jason Voorhees. And unlike later entries in this series, there is still a grit here, it's not all shiny and glossy. This is another 80's classic, and one you should definitely add to your collection.",1433980800,,1320,4.636752136752137
2133628,5,B0002WYTWG,"THE TERMINATOR is a cultural cornerstone. It's inspired countless other movies and TV shows. While some of the special effects have aged poorly (partly due to the phenomenal picture quality), it still holds up well overall. Even if you haven't seen it, you probably know the premise: a killer robot is sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, who would mother the man who would defeat Skynet. To keep himself from getting time aborted, John Connor sends his best man, Kyle Reese, back in time to save Sarah. Action ensues.

So how about this Blu Ray? Well, the picture is good. Everything's crystal clear. The sound is where issues pop up. Longtime fans have voiced their complaint about the gunshots. ""The Hardballer sounds awful"" is a common thing to hear about every home release of The Terminator except for those that used the original monoaural sound... On VHS. Also, during one of the big shootouts, one of the shotgun blasts is accompanied by the sound of a machine gun burst. How did nobody catch such an obvious goof?

It's a good buy overall. That said, if another version is released with the original gunshot sounds, I'd definitely pick that one up over this one.",1433980800,,1175,4.726829268292683

I bought this newly re-released version of T2, because I loved the new cover art, and assumed that all extras have been ported over from the T2 'Skynet Edition' of the blu-ray.  Not so.

2133669,1,B0002WYTWG,"Another Terminator sequel is about to be released in Cinemas in July this year
i'm a Huge Terminator fan but in my opinion the franchise has run itself into the Ground
the last sequel was Terminator salvation, i wasn't impressed with the screenplay or the Director
so Terminator salvation ended the sequels with me
the first 2 are the best of course, the 3rd sequel is tolerable and then the 4th sequel which i've only seen once
i didn't think much of it it's a matter of opinion really

anyway MGM have decided to reissue the original Terminator movie again
only because there's another sequel coming out
so what's different this time around, nothing absolutely nothing
the picture quality & sound quality are exactly the same as the 2013 remastered edition
which i must say has been given an amazing High Definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen, no Grain or Dirt in the picture quality
plus the texture/colour has been corrected
all the extras from the very old dvd have been carried over, except for Other voices Documentary
MGM did however add a Visual effects & Music score featurette called Creating the Terminator
the interviews from this featurette are taken from the Other voices Documentary
only 8-9mins of interviews are taken from the Other voices Doco
interviews with Gale anne Hurd, Special visual effects man Gene Warren, Music composer Brad fiedel
for some stupid reason MGM did not bother to add the full Documentary of Other voices which they should've had
how stupid just take certain interviews from the Doco Disgusting effort really
back to this new 2015 reissue
the special features are exactly the same as the 2013 remastered blu-ray
no new extras, no new sound mix like a 6.1 or 7.1 Master audio mix, just the same 5.1 Master audio mix from the 2013 version
the only difference between the 2013 blu-ray & this new 2015 reissue is the cover art that's all it is

for me personally i have the 2013 blu-ray version which i think has a much, much better cover art
than this new 2015 reissue

1 star for this new blu-ray reissue",1431820800,,2087,4.730769230769231

I was one of guys to have seen the new trailer and my expactitions for the movie are totally met with skepticism. So since I got the first terminator movie, I figured I just make the review so that I may express thoughts on it and how it still hold up today.

This movie was freaking awsome. The action was great. It had story, compelling characters, and one cool preformance from our main man Arnold Schwarzenegger as the human killing machine: The Terminator.

It's great to see how James Cameron can make this movie with a low budget and genius vision to go with it. The decisions he makes working on the project are bold and brave like General Patton. That is why he is may favorite director.

The special effects in this movie is amazing. It is good to see how they can make good movie with more pratical effects and less CGI then what they had done in 1984. James Cameron is a geinus.

2133703,5,B0002WYTWG,"In the far future the war between man and machine still rages on. John Connor leads the resistance against the self-aware, super computer Skynet and its army of Terminator robots. Skynet makes another attempt to change history by sending another Terminator into the past, this time to 1995, with orders on killing a young John Connor ( Edward Furlong). Future Connor sends a Terminator of his own to prevent the assassination. -summary

Here goes the movie which provides the argument that not all sequels suck, to include they can also surpass the original, and in a very big way. Directed by James Cameron, Terminator 2 is the direct sequel to the original Terminator, and although the film utilizes the exact same chase formula, and the fight for survival against a very powerful enemy, Cameron was able to pull off being original as well as innovative. This film took place at a time when he was actually serious about telling a story that combined both substance and style. For a film that came out back in 1991, T2 holds up amazingly well in this day and age, providing an ample amount of action with incredible special effects, and when looking at the budget to make this movie, it damn well better hold up some 20 years later.

The story is interesting and gripping almost from the get go. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, and in her quest to prevent Judgment Day she landed herself in a mental institution where she's horribly treated; probably because of her behavior which involves attacks on personnel along with repeated escape attempts. John Connor is about 11 years old (even though it's almost impossible to buy into that) living with foster parents and he comes off as a bit of a jerk. Then we're introduced to the two Terminators, which builds up the suspense rather well leading up to the inevitable encounter.

Cameron's direction was fantastic delivering some really good action scenes with lots of shoot outs and explosive car chases. I was never bored when the action was going down, and the battles between the two robots had some really good moments. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the Terminator, however he is not the show stealer this time, that honor belongs to the T-1000 played by Robert Patrick, a new liquid metal based Terminator with some amazing abilities. Patrick played the role of the determined, emotionless killer flawless in my eyes.

The action and special effects are quite possibly the best thing the movie has to offer, but when the guns are put in the holster, Cameron manages to tell a gripping story which not only plays on the man vs. monster theme, but soon becomes a fight for survival by preventing the apocalyptic future. The characters had some good chemistry from where I saw things and it brought out some good interactions. I enjoyed Hamilton's role a lot more this time around, due to her developing more into a warrior who's going to put an end to this thing at all cost. If I would have only one gripe with the characters it would probably be John Connor. I just can't put my finger on it exactly, but it was something about his character I didn't really care for. He's good for the most part, he just didn't appeal to me like the rest of the cast. Especially Arnold's Terminator, as he developed more of a personality which showed more innovation with Cameron's writing. Brad Feidel's music score was still amazing, and it clearly enhanced the action scenes bringing more intensity to them.

Minus a small editing issue at some point in the movie, I really can't think of anything negative to say about this. Nostalgia has nothing to do with it that's for damn sure. I really think it's an excellent action sci-fi, and that ending couldn't have capped things off any better. There is a level of violence going on here with a couple of very brutal death scenes that may bother some.

Overall, Cameron added to the Terminator mythos with some believable content that didn't seem tacked on in the slightest. I always felt his first two Terminator films were the best in his filmography. If there is an action fan whom hasn't seen this yet, then check it out whenever you get the chance. This receives my highest recommendation.

Cons:Nothing worth mentioning",1429833600,,4298,4.783018867924528

2133735,5,B0002WYTWG,"In a possible yet distant future, mankind is locked in deadly battle and are close to the brink of extinction. This is due to the war taking place with a machine named Skynet whom would eventually become self-aware. In order to guarantee its victory for the future, Skynet sends a cyborg assassin called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to the past, with his mission being to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) whom happens to be the mother of the soon-to-be leader of the resistance John Connor. John sends his own warrior to the past, a soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah at all cost. -summary

Even after all these years, The Terminator which was released in 1984 still holds up as an epic sci-fi action thriller. The film is virtually flawless and delivers a simple, yet intricate story on man vs. monster that flows with such grace; from the stunning opening to the thrilling end. James Cameron pretty much out did himself with this film, and it has been regarded as one of the best action movies of all time. Cameron would also inherit the curse along with the gift, as this movie would also be the measuring stick for his future works; but on a side note, I just can't shake the very possible influence of Chris Claremont's: X- Men: Days of Future Past storyline. The storyline for this film feels too familiar.

I still enjoy the eerie opening taking place on future Earth over the post-apocalyptic setting. This is a very scary world indee, that really didn't need much dialogue to describe it as hell on earth. The machines consist of futuristic tanks and aircrafts which are heavily armed with laser turrets, and they're moving forward displaying their sheer dominance over mankind by plowing over scores of wreckage and human skulls. The night time sky is an excellent backdrop here as well. James Cameron exercises the ""show and don't tell rule"" perfectly, by letting the viewers know that there is very little hope for mankind's survival here. I commend Cameron for his use of symbolism, as well as taking the theme of man losing control of his tools to the extreme. The Terminator is a perfect example of the puppets overthrowing the puppet masters.

Although dated in some areas, the special effects do hold up for the most part. I loved the use of lighting and camera work especially, which brought out the best in numerous action scenes with the very first encounter in the club being one of the standouts. I know it was obvious that Sarah Connor could not die so early in the film, but the camera work meshed so well with the tension build up. It just so happens to stand out as one of my favorite scenes in the movie. There are some moments where the make up was a bit too fake, and the Terminator's face heavily resembled Michael Myer's mask to a certain degree, at least to me it did; but I think the gore was well done, and I enjoyed the sound effects when the Terminator was repairing himself. Now as far as the action goes, there isn't a single action scene that I could dare say was bland. Everything was done right, with the encounters becoming more and more fierce, with lots of gun play and innocent bystanders being mowed down along with cops. That's some really good stuff right there. Brad Fiedel also received plenty of well deserved praise for that music score. The BGM worked great together with everything, from the piano laced track depicting Sarah's innocence while she was riding on her scooter, to the menacing synthesized score during the all out attack on the police station. Fiedel is a master of his craft, and he would go on to put together an amazing piece in Jeff Lieberman's Just Before Dawn.

Terminator: ""Sarah Connor?""

Sarah #1: ""Yes?""

*Blaow!*

I just love the story here, and there's a bit of subtle humor thrown in there from my point of view. The plot is well written with some good scenes, and plenty of great interactions along with story background in the form of dialogue and flashbacks, which also plays in the character development. I also have to point out that the film features a sex scene that is actually important to the plot. That's not something you see often. The characters are very likable, and Arnie steals the show as the cold and merciless cyborg. I don't believe anyone could have played that role at the time. He just had the perfect look, big, strong, and an emotionless demeanor. Hamilton was great also and her transition from an innocent damsel into a hard fighter was believable, Biehn deserves some credit for his good performance as well.

The only issue that I have is just that bit of male nudity. Thankfully, it actually serves a purpose and wasn't thrown in there just because. In closing, The Terminator is definitely among the best action films ever. I can't imagine my collection without it. I highly recommend this to anyone whom has never seen it. I only advise to be on the look out for the special effects that could appear very dated to some folks by today's standards.

Pros: Story, very solid plot, action, character develop

Cons: Two too many males butts",1428537600,,5083,4.675615212527965

The special effects don't seem too dated considering this was one of the first major films to showcase CGI front-and-center... It's good that they knew their limits, and because of that, most of the effects still look passable today. The only effect that was glaring to me was the Evil Terminator's shotgun wounds that were like metalic funnels. When being created or healed, they were decent looking CGI, and very shiny liquid-chrome/mercury... But after being shot, and before healing the wounds, they were obviously pinned-on to his jacket and looked like they were formed from the dull side of aluminum foil or something. Glaring sheen and texture contrast that wouldn't pass these days, but that's the only effect that stuck out.... Not bad for a movie 24 years old...",1428105600,,969,4.802395209580839

2133752,5,B0002WYTWG,"This review won't be a review of the movie, which is one of the greatest action/sci-fi films of all time (second only to Aliens, in my humble opinion). Instead, this will solely review the features of a particular DVD edition. I wanted to post this since I noticed there are several different DVD versions of T2 floating around and I wanted to try to help anyone who couldn't decide which one to buy.

So, this review is specifically for the Extreme DVD edition of T2 released by Artisan Home Entertainment. My copy has Arnold on the front and it's the two-disc version.

I bought this edition a few days ago, since I'm almost finished clearing out my old VHS tapes (yep, still got 'em) and hadn't yet re-purchased certain favorites on DVD. I chose this version of T2 mostly for the availability from Amazon (as opposed to an outside seller) and the low price, and I'm glad that I did. This is an excellent edition. It doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles as the Ultimate Edition DVD, but it's still definitely a worthy purchase.

The first disc contains a special edition version of the film with 16 minutes of additional scenes inserted seamlessly. There are commentaries included and an interactive mode which includes behind-the-scenes footage, as well as English and Spanish subtitles. Happily, I discovered that the original theatrical version is also included, and can be accessed if you move your cursor or DVD selector to the blank panel on the right-hand side of the main menu screen. When you do this, the words 'The Future is Not Yet Set' appear in red and if you select them, you will be taken to a secondary menu screen for the theatrical version. I was delighted about this because at my time of purchase, this particular edition was -not- advertised as including both versions of the film on DVD, and being nostalgic, I'm glad to have the version of T2 I've loved and watched hundreds of times since childhood (I was 9 years old when Judgment Day came out). The theatrical version doesn't include commentary or an interactive mode, but does feature English and Spanish subtitles.

Though this edition claims to be remastered in high definition, the transfer isn't completely perfect. The film looks incredibly crisp and clear compared to my old VHS tape, of course, but there are certain scenes (many of the high-action sequences, specifically) which seem to have retained a small amount of that familiar 90's grain. Personally, I don't mind it, and I probably wouldn't have even noticed it if I hadn't been watching the film specifically to review the DVD quality, but if you're looking for vastly improved picture quality, this version might not be the one for you.

What IS perfect, on the other hand, is the upgraded sound. This film won two 1992 Academy Awards in the sound category, and that excellence is retained here. Every crunched bone, shot fired, and pitch change in Edward Furlong's voice is preserved beautifully, along with Brad Fiedel's gorgeous and memorable film score, which spent six weeks on the Billboard charts in 1991. Even on my ten-year-old 25-watt computer speakers, this movie sounds fantastic.

The second disc has some interesting special features, including two documentaries: one about the making of the film, and the other about life on the set, complete with backstage footage, production footage, and interviews. They also included a separate theatrical version of the film which can *only* be played from your PC using Windows Media Player 9, as well as an 'FX Studio' and 'Skynet Combat Chassis Designer' for you to tinker with on your computer.

All in all, this is a great DVD release of an excellent action film. If you're on the fence about which edition to buy and are looking for an inexpensive version that doesn't skimp on quality or special features, don't hesitate to pick this one up.",1427587200,,3858,4.845220030349013

2133813,5,B0002WYTWG,"One of the best original science fiction action adventure film franchises of all time.  Arnold and his character are simply masterpieces, and Linda Hamilton is also awesome.

 Great sci fi plot where an evil cyborg from the future travels back in time to the 80's to hunt down and murder the mother of the military commander of the future ""human resistance Army"" led by John Conner.  The evil cold and calculating AI called ""Skynet"" has destroyed most of the Earth but creates a time machine to destroy their human arch nemesis and prevent him from being born.

 Hero and soldier Kyle Reese is sent back into time to save Linda Hamilton, and fight the dreaded Terminator in an interstellar battle between good and evil.

 I had found that Linda Hamilton played well as a character who starts out as a normal young woman working her way through life forced to toughen up and become a surviving soldier in a cosmic duel between the forces of a decent and free humanity verses the cruel and soulless ""Skynet"".  Her transformation is a powerful one that many in the audience can learn from, and identify with on a human and basic survival level.

 Great first act to a long and enduring sci fi epic which later includes the better sequel. T-2 Judgment Day, ""The Sara Conner Chronicles"" tv show, T-3, Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale as Conner, and the upcoming ""Terminator Genesis"" with the actress from ""Game of Thrones"" along with the actor from ""Planet of the Apes"".

 I cannot wait for Arnold to ""be back"", because like ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", ""Batman"", ""X-Men"", ""Conan"", ""Highlander"", ""Aliens"", ""Avengers"", and other epics the ""Terminator"" franchise is some of the best sci fi action adventure material ever conceived.

Later that same year Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly cast in a science fiction thriller for what would later become his signature role. Part man, part machine. THE TERMINATOR.

Written and directed by James Cameron, this movie has created a massive fan base. Even on a limited budget at the time it was being developed, it is highly enjoyable in terms of acting and character development without going overboard with special effects.

2133876,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2: Judgement Day = Pure awesome defined in a sci-fi action adventure film.  Arnold is back, but this time as a reprogramed version of his original self, a Terminator who protects and fights off other Terminators.  This is how sequels should be written

 Sarah Conner, the heroine from the first film, has been institutionalized in a mental ward because of her experiences surviving her first encounter with a deadly Terminator of Arnold's original design and image.  Her son has been sent as a troubled teen to adoptive parents near Los Angeles, where both he and his mother have been targeted again by an even more powerful, and deadly Terminator (with the super powered ability of becoming liquid metal and reshaping itself into just about anything.)

 In an attempt to hunt down and murder young John Conner, Arnold's Terminator succeeds in finding John first, protecting him from the liquid Terminator.  Then the group rescues his mother held inside the mental ward, where she is then informed that there are two Terminators in their world, one good and one evil.

  Terminator 2 rings in the true moral ""Rene Decarte"" philosophy of being a Terminator, ""I think there for I terminate""  When young John Conner instructs the Terminator who is programmed to protect him in the past, ""You just can't go around killing everybody!"" The android Arnold simply replies with a question, ""Why?""

 A: ""Because you just can't.""

Thus is the ultimate, even Biblical question for man, why do positive good deeds at all in the world?  What is the nature of man and what is man's worth?  What is the awesome power, in both the secular modern era and the ancient religious, of pure goodness?  Why is being a good person important and what is the nature of service, sacrifice, courage, and true heroism?

 Is it that good is the driving force and most common among people's ideals and behaviors, and is this the reason why good is basically much stronger then the power of evil?

If mankind is so violent, greedy, hate filled, and sadistic then why stand up for humanity at all?  If ""Skynet"" represents the future while humanity represents the obsolete past, should not ""Skynet"" rule the Earth?

Why build the courage and strength, both inside and outside, as a ""Soldier slash Knight of armor"" in order to confront evil when ever it's form appears in the world of man?

If mankind is capable of committing the same atrocities as ""Skynet"", then why bother preventing the nuclear holocaust of ""Judgement Day"" if that same destruction is inevitable?

Is Arnold in defiance of his own cold-machnaical nature as the ""physically and mentally"" superior cyborg (superior to humans), when he selflessly fights off the T-1000 and protects young John Conner?

  What is the nature and power from the goodness espoused by one noble teenager & his influence on an all powerful cybernetic machine like Arnold's T-800?

All of these questions are brought up, and debated strongly all the while the non stop action occurs in the galactic battle of all time wages between the powers of good verses evil.

""No fate in what we make.""

  Terminator 2 is the masterpiece work of the entire Terminator franchise, and worth your time and money.  Arnold is back, and back with a bang.",1423699200,,3256,4.86

2133888,5,B0002WYTWG,"""The Terminator"" is two things that are very good to be: a movie that is of its time, and a movie for all time. From the opening minutes it is almost fetishistically contemporary. A superimposed text says the events of the film take place ""tonight,"" a rather hokey tactic, most often seen in the horror genre, that may create a sense of immediacy for some first-run viewers but that becomes increasingly ironic as time takes its toll on the fashion, the music, the hair, and so on. ""Terminator""'s first act is an onslaught of such tell-tale signs of the time, and the time in question is peak 1980s. This is not a bad thing. The movie so successfully captures the spirit of its era that later movies set in its milieu often appear to be, and in many cases undoubtedly are, copying it. It wasn't the first movie to take place in fume- and trash-filled urban alleys and neon-lit dance clubs, or to feature independent women who do things like have sex and ride motorcycles without prompting censure or even comment, but it was arguably the best and best-looking and most influential movie to do these things at this time. In other words, it is an icon of 1980s film.

It is also an icon of film generally. It accomplished that even grander feat through a combination of brilliant achievements. First, the casting, particularly of Arnold Schwarzenegger. His early acting career benefited enormously from the existence of roles that nobody else could have played quite as well. Conan the Barbarian was a near-Neanderthal: strong, serious, a mythic figure of great stature and few words. The Terminator is the same, though he kills for different reasons. Arnold is menacing, darkly funny, and extremely cool in the role, all at once. Second, the script. It serves timeless lines on a silver platter for Schwarzenegger and the other two leads, and they all three seem to know exactly what to do with them. They take soundbytes and throw them at us like sticks of dynamite, and when they land we feel them: ""Come with me if you want to live,"" ""I'll be back,"" and ""You're terminated, f*cker."" (The last one is another reminder that we're in the 1980s, a long-ago time when action and sci-fi movies were sometimes made for adults, not just teens. The language here is strong, the violence is not all bloodless, and the sex is very much on- screen.) Third, a time-travel plot that is unusually well thought out, capable of being communicated without too much belabored exposition, and that leaves plenty of room for further exploration without raising too many unanswered questions. It is strong conceptual ground on which to build a media empire.

Like 1983's ""WarGames"" (which also featured a motorcycle-riding female lead), the central idea in ""Terminator"" is that computers might one day destroy humanity. Unlike ""WarGames,"" which approached the subject from a software angle and took its cues from real programming concepts, ""Terminator"" casts a tangible piece of hardware in the role of unstoppable stalker killer. This leads to perhaps its only real weakness as a movie. Toward the end, as plot recedes and special effects (mostly stop motion) come to the fore, it begins to feel too much like the horror movies that it echoes in its opening text. The false endings that typify that genre are as predictable as ever, and the Terminator becomes just another riff on Michael Myers. But if the penultimate scenes are derivative, they are nevertheless satisfying, and the film ends on a note that provides closure and leaves you eager for more.",1423180800,,3537,4.854304635761589

2133905,4,B0002WYTWG,"There is something fundamental about this movie that transcended decades. It wasn't robots we were being warned about, it was corporations looking to corner the globe's resources for their own wealth and power. These terminators, taking on the shapes of ordinary people simply signified that having an ordinary life was not guaranteed, especially if it got in the way of those with money and power. Sarah had the right idea once she realized the truth. Today, our water supply is sold back to us, our foods are engineered in labs, our entertainment doled out in virtual space... Terminator was before its time.",1421971200,,610,4.990196078431373
2133906,5,B0002WYTWG,"Excellent film - definitely the best of the ""Terminator"" series, by far - if for no other reason than the interaction between the original Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) cyborg and the ""liquid metal"" T-1000 (Patrick Stewart) which does, on occasion, become humorous at times. But the best part of this DVD set (2-disc set - the 2nd disc has all of the ""special features"" on it incl. cast interviews, etc.) is the ""Extreme T-2""(""Director's Cut"") version of the film - you get treated to QUITE a bit more footage in various places throughout the film that you never got to see otherwise. The ""regular"" theatrical version of the film is also included so you can choose which version you want to watch. WELL worth the $$ spent, in my humble opinion...!!",1421712000,,753,4.8

2133927,5,B0002WYTWG,"If you're young and never seen this before, you may be underwhelmed. And that's too bad because this is one of the best scifi action flicks of the last 50 years. I saw this movie in the theater on my 13th birthday and it scared the carp outta me!! The Terminator at the end gave me nightmares for weeks (when you're 13 and impressionable, that sucker looked REAL!! Not so much today lol). But I loved it! I must have seen this movie 50 times since then, know all the words, etc. This is the best version I've seen yet, very clear and the sound very good as well. Yes, it's a little dated, but this was 1984. Take yourself back to that time and era, before selfies and smartphones and this movie is fun. Also the movie that made James Cameron a star director and go on to direct his next flick, Aliens (another great movie btw). If you're middle aged and grew up on 80's action movies like this, for under $10, it's definitely worth adding to your collection. Especially since this is the prequel to the mega-hit ""T2"" and with the new remake coming out summer 2015. Get it and enjoy!",1420761600,,1082,4.3088235294117645

2133947,5,B0002WYTWG,"Dystopian fiction will always fascinate a majority of us, mainly because we have a deep feeling that humanity's dark side will win. With the Terminator series, it takes on a unique spin. What if the future is controlled by a force that isn't human, and must be stopped in ways we haven't dealt with before? This installment in the series may be the best one. We see Arnold as a hero terminator, which seems to appeal to a vast majority of the audience.

I tore the whole thing apart and completely devalued it. Oh yes. I was brutal. After burning it with a torch, rewiring the LED lit eyes and replacing a lot of the components with actual metal (rather than plastic), it finally looks f*cking rad. It was always intended to be the most awesome headphone and Oculus headset stand....and it finally is.

It's a great film don't get me wrong but when the only version being released to DVD is the director's cut...it makes things difficult. I had to search long and hard for the Ultimate Edition DVD. It has got to be the most incredible DVD made. It is packed with special features and most importantly...two versions of the film. Both the theatrical and director's cut. And yes, they are both available on the DVD menu for viewing. Not many people seem to notice the 30 seconds or so cut from the scene in the mental hospital when the Doc is speaking with Sarah about what she now believes. It only seems to be cut on the ""theatrical"" release on this DVD only. I can forgive that little transfer mishap considering the many versions of this one movie floating around.

The DTS sound for this action movie is excellent.  If you love T2 then you will love the Blu-ray version.

Like others I had difficulty getting this to play at first on my Blu-ray player because of the BD live feature.  I kept getting insufficient memory errors.  And like others once I plugged a flash memory stick (aka Thumb Drive) in the USB port on the front of my Blu-ray player it loaded and played fine.  I have only had to plug in the flash memory that one time.  Since then the movie loads and plays fine without having to plug in the flash memory again.

2134249,5,B0002WYTWG,"Some may say otherwise, but I really do think that this movie really does match up to the original from 1984. With its top-notch, yet balanced use of computer-generated effects, it has proven to be a milestone for its time. You always get those critics who think that special effects are stupid, but I have to constantly remind people that you can only accomplish so much without them, especially in the case of the Terminator series.

Anyways, let us talk more about the actual movie itself, shall we? Set several years after the ordeal with the original terminator, Sarah Connor is held in a psychiatric hospital, and the young John Connor is a juvenile delinquent in foster care. The shape-shifting T-1000 has been sent back in time by Skynet in a second attempt to erase John's existence, therefore thwarting his leadership of the human resistance against the future war with the machines. Meanwhile, a re-programmed T-800 has been sent to intercept by means of protecting John from assassination. Even though it does not have much to do with the actual plot, I thought that the bar fight scene (which was really more of a one-sided beat-down with the bikers on the receiving end) was one of the funniest Arnold Schwarzenegger movie scenes I have ever seen in my life, hands down.

Throughout the movie, John develops a relationship with the T-800, resembling that of a father-son connection. John teaches the T-800 new catchphrases that have gone on to become iconic trademarks, particularly ""Hasta La Vista, baby!"" He even goes so far as to teach this former killing machine that killing is wrong. What I thought was really powerful about this was that it illustrates the idea that machines with artificial intelligence can possibly learn the value of human life, or of biological life in general. This was especially evident at the end when the T-800 said ""I know now why you cry... but that is something I could never do."" It definitely gives us hope that maybe one day, the numerous peoples of our world can learn to leave our petty differences behind, stop fighting about pointless garbage, and focus on our common interests for the greater good.

Honestly, this is an awesome movie, and the perfect sequel to the original terminator movie from 1984. Critics can bash it all they want over the use of special effects, but that is not going to lower this movie's standing as a classic for its time.",1408838400,,2407,4.809178743961352

The finest film of its kind, Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Skynet Edition] captured Arnold Schwarzenegger at the very apex of his Hollywood celebrity and James Cameron at the peak of his perfectionist directorial powers. Nothing the star did subsequently measured up to his iconic performance here, spouting legendary catchphrases and wielding weaponry with unparalleled cool; and while the director had an even bigger hit with the bloated and sentimental Titanic, few followers of his career would deny that Cameron's true forte has always been sci-fi action. T2's pivotal blending of extraordinary live-action stunt work and FX looks more and more like it will never be equalled. The Blu-ray Disc release that is Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Skynet Edition] includes three versions of the film, which includes the Theatrical version, Second the special edition version featuring 20 minutes or so of additional footage, and finally the third version which is accessible via a special code.

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: Terminator 2: Judgment Day received many accolades, which are as follows: 45th British Academy Film Awards: Won: BAFTA Award for Best Sound for Lee Orloff, Tom Johnson, Gary Rydstrom and Gary Summers.

Nominated: BAFTA Award for Best Production Design for Joseph Nemec. 64th Academy Awards: Won: Best Make Up for Stan Winston and Jeff Dawn.

Won: Best Visual Effects for Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Gene Warren Jr. and Robert Skotak. Nominated: Best Cinematography for Adam Greenberg. Nominated: Film Editing for Conrad Buff, Mark Goldblatt and Richard A. Harris. The highest-grossing film of 1991, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, has since been ranked by several publications such as the American Film Institute as one of the greatest action films, science fiction films and sequels of all time. The film's visual effects saw breakthroughs in computer-generated imagery, including the first use of natural human motion for a computer-generated character and the first partially computer-generated main character. Terminator 2: Judgment Day was a critical and commercial success and influenced popular culture, especially the use of visual effects in films.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Using his imagination and not much more, James Cameron devised The Terminator, with the lean, mean 1984 action film that became a classic of apocalypse-minded science fiction. What this meant, is that in keeping with inexorable Hollywood logic, was that James Cameron would become a prime candidate for sequel onslaught. He would be able to follow up his original shoestring hit with a second instalment whose budget is reportedly somewhere near the $100 million mark. That figure suggests at the very least a typographical error, not to mention mistakes of a more serious kind. Surprise, James Cameron has made a swift, exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first films potentential, but rudimentary visual style. He has also broadened his initial idea to encompass better developed characters; after all, the first Terminator was barely verbal, a livelier wit and a more ambitious, if nuttier, message.

But here we have a cautionary tale: Terminator 2: Judgment Day anticipates nuclear disaster in the year 1997 unless there is intervention from the forces of good, who happen to specialize in shootouts, clubbing, slamming, poundings and explosions. This tirelessly violent, ultimately exhausting film has the utter sincerity of all good science fiction, and a lot more flair than most, but it suffers from a certain confusion of purpose. In the end, it amounts to quite the pistol-packing plea for peace. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator in this explosive action-adventure spectacle. Now he's one of the good guys, sent back in time to protect John Connor, the boy destined to lead the freedom fighters of the future. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, John's mother; a quintessential survivor who has been institutionalized for her warning of the nuclear holocaust she knows is inevitable. Together, the threesome must find a way to stop the ultimate enemy-the T-1000, the most lethal Terminator ever created. Co-written, produced and directed by James Cameron, The Terminator, Aliens and Titanic, this visual tour de force is also a touching human story of survival.

Some do say, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is it really the greatest sequel ever? I know 'T2' has many, many fans who rate is higher than 1984's cult sleeper hit 'The Terminator,' and I would never try to persuade them otherwise. 'T2' doesn't work quite as well as the original, if only because the first two 'Terminator' films are very different beasts. 'T2' doesn't so much replicate the scrappy B-movie thrills of the first 'Terminator' as morph its chintzy charms into a bombastic, special-effects-laden morality play. 'T2' isn't a remake or even a reimagining instead, it pumps up the best qualities of 'The Terminator' and grafts them onto a family drama, adding fable-like qualities. Weird, yes, but judging by its grosses, it worked.

No need to recap the story of 'T2' for the three people who have yet to see the film. Let's just say that James Cameron wisely doesn't try to revert to his main characters, especially Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, and of course the Terminator is back to the state where we last left them at the end of the first film, as most sequels-slash-remakes would. Rather, he turns Sarah into a nut-job who has effectively abandoned her son and turned herself into the martyr to end all martyrs, allowing the story to expand naturally into new directions. But even better, James Cameron inverts the Terminator himself and it is no secret to reveal that the mean ol' Arnie of 'Terminator' is all soft and cuddly in 'T2,' now the protector of the young John Connor [Edward Furlong]. So not only does that give 'T2' a great spin on the original, but it allows for the introduction of a brand-new villain, the morphing T-1000 [Robert Patrick]. Let's just say had James Cameron simply restaged the Sarah-Terminator battles from the first film only with more money, we wouldn't still be talking about 'T2' today.

'T2' ironically, cemented its status as such an influential blockbuster. Quite frankly, the film's once-cutting edge CGI effects have quickly become slightly outdated. Even back in 1992, and I thought at the time the films effects coup, the ""liquid metal"" T-1000, looked brilliant, but even by the rules and structure of the fantasy world James Cameron created the effect we felt was ahead of its time. While in the framework of the film we all felt we could believe that a liquid metal Robot could go around and kill people, and especially at the time I was still confused as to how his clothes and skin miraculously reappear at a moment's notice. Are they liquid metal, too? And where is the C.P.U. central processing unit located? How are all the individual molecules bound together? And how come whenever the T-1000 gets split apart or blown up, all the pieces can still function? And if the machine is supposed to be liquid metal by Earth standards, this is still, after all, supposed to be a ""realistic future,"" how does the metal heat itself up and cool itself off so quickly, a lot of questions that we never really had answers to?

Perhaps in a spirit of detente, James Cameron, who wrote the screenplay with William Wisher, limits the story's weaponry mostly to guns, providing no technology on a par with the Terminators themselves. But this makes for inconsistencies and repetition, since the T-1000 can heal himself, albeit rather spectacularly, any time he springs a leak. It takes special tricks, like the one whereby the Terminator reduces T-1000 to brittle fragments that become liquid blobs and then reassemble and rise again, to cope with such a special fellow.

Also notable about Terminator 2: Judgment Day are Arnold Schwarzenegger's perfect aplomb, Brad Fiedel's ominous music, Edward Furlong's fine, scrappy performance as the story's young hero, Linda Hamilton's wild-eyed combativeness and the film's apt casting of Joe Morton as a successful computer entrepreneur on whose decisions the future depends. ""It's not every day that you find out you're responsible for three billion deaths!"" he exclaims, late in the story. This, in the feverish atmosphere of Terminator 2: Judgment Day is what passes for a sober moment.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Presented in an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, encoded with an awesome 1080p transfer, James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Skynet Edition] arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of UK-based distributors Optimum Releasing. The disc contains the Theatrical and Special Edition versions of the film as well as the Extended Special Edition version. The access code for it is 82997. The special edition version seems to be using seamless branching which delivers the missing footage in with the theatrical cut of the film. First thing you'll notice there is no longer the macro blocking and artefacts that plagued the previous version. Unfortunately there has been some noise reduction applied which causes the image to occasionally have a smoothed out look. Fine detail and clarity are much improved as is sharpness. Blacks are middle of the road, never the deepest images in a few scenes. Flesh tones remain natural throughout. If you had the original release on DVD or Laserdisc, you will notice a massive improvement in sharpness, detail and clarity. Until James Cameron actually decides to oversee a new restoration of the film, this is the best presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  This release is presented in a few different audio calibrations and formats. The primary one and the new track is the 6.1 DTS-HD Master Audio accompanied by 5.1 DTS-HD High Resolution track. Keep in mind that the surround mixes on here are THX certified so LIONSGATE claims anyway. To say this is demo material is an understatement. Though we haven't gotten the reference transfer hoped for, this is the T2 audio presentation you have been waiting for. Bass is powerful and packs a huge punch during the many action set pieces. Dynamics are very impressive for a film from 1991. There are audio effects that emanate in a 360 sound field that really enhance the feeling that you are right there in the fight for the future. Nice subtlety was noticed as well. Dialogue is clear throughout and well defined. The iconic score sounds amazing from the opening titles through the film and the end credits. A superb job has been done for this presentation and it can stand on its own against a few of the action film mixes from more recent films.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director James Cameron and Co-Author William Wisher: This Audio Production Commentary is supplied from two archival tracks culled from the previous DVD releases. Director James Cameron in his first ever commentary track is accompanied by co-writer William Wisher. This is a real treat for fans as Cameron goes into great detail of all the aspects of making the film. Wisher is a good co-pilot as he is very articulate and just ad passionate about the film. Highly recommended you listen to this.

The second audio Writer and Director Commentary track is excellent as well. It contains an assemblage of audio interview extracts. Featuring a total of 26 members of the cast and crew of Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Skynet Edition], Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, James Cameron and a montage of the technical and film crew. There is so much information and great trivia on this track that if you're even a casual fan you will come away with a greater respect for the film and its achievements.

The 2 Feature Audio Commentaries with 23 members of the Cast and Crew: This is the twenty six participant strong 1993 commentary track that was included with the majority of the previous releases of the film. Chances are that you've probably already heard it if you own one of the older copies of the film on the inferior NTSC  DVD.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [1080p] [6:00] Since the Blu-ray disc provides both the extended and theatrical versions of Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Skynet Edition], we are only given 2 deleted scenes separately from the film. The first is a really cool scene with the T-1000 searching John Connor's bedroom. I love the way Robert Patrick plays this scene with the T-1000 never really touching, instead he sort of glance his hand over items seemingly gaining information that way. The other scene is the highly debated alternate ending, featuring Linda Hamilton in old-age make-up and a future LA with people in the background wearing outrageous outfits to look futuristic. It doesn't work because it does not fit with the look and tone of rest of the film, never mind the fact that is a clichd happy ending. If this scene was kept in the original theatrical cut, I doubt the film would be as beloved.

Special Feature: Feature Length Picture-in-Picture [1080p] Watch behind the scenes along with the film.

Special Feature [1080p] Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Slideshow with Cast and Crew comments using state of the art branching technology.

Special Feature: Text Production Commentary and Trivia Track with Animated Graphics in sync with the film [1080p] This is a text-based quiz that runs along with the film and asks you to answer multiple choice questions about on-screen events. It's slightly annoying that the film pauses every time a question pops up, but at least it saves your progress between sessions, a function that I assume requires a Profile 2.0 player.

Special Feature: Storyboard and Script showed in synch with the film [1080p] Select this option to view original storyboard sequences in time with the film independently of the other features.

Special Feature: Interactive Quizzes and Games while you watch the film: This mode allows you to play Terminator-themed mini-games. These take the form of sliding puzzles, timed combinations and the like. You can skip through the film to the next puzzle if you don't want to wait, and your score is saved at the end of each session should you wish to take a break.

Special Feature [1080p] Seamless Branching of the Theatrical, Directors and Ultimate Cuts of T2.

Special Feature [1080p] Trailer Downloads, Text, Biographies, Banners and Wallpapers available via BD-Live.

Special Feature [1080p] Bookmarks, D-Box Motion Codes and THX Optimizer.

Theatrical Trailers [1080p] It gives you three trailers plus a couple of extra previews. Included are the films teaser and two theatrical trailers. Also included is a video promo for the T2 special edition DVD, and the T2 THX logo that features the THX logo being blown away then melts like the T-1000 and rises back up with the famous THX sound. It is nice that LIONSGATE decided to present all of the clips in 1080p video and they look real good. Overall, the bonus materials are loaded big time, but unfortunately it is all recycled from the DVD releases.

Finally, Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Skynet Edition]  is a very solid,  feature-packed Blu-ray release which exploits the second generation abilities of the high-definition disc format to recommend its inclusion into Arnie film fans' and Terminator fanatics' home video libraries. This film has had multiple home entertainment releases going back over fifteen years via VHS, LaserDisc editions, and across numerous DVD releases and editions which always promised more of the movie audiences crave. Credit to LIONSGATE for delivering a much more robust Blu-ray effort which justifies the Skynet Edition just three years after the bare bones treatment it got, and indeed the vastly upgraded DTS-HD soundtrack and treasure trove of bonus material approach must-see status. But overall, the Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Skynet Edition] extends the Terminator franchise into the 21st century where it belongs, both technologically for home viewing and thematically in its futurist dramatic frame of reference. James Cameron's mind-bending tale of destruction and destiny, placing mankind's future on the narrow shoulders of young John Connor, has never looked and sounded better, and this Skynet Edition pulls out all the stops to enhance your TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY [SKYNET EDITION] you will experience so much better, than ever before and of course as you can guess that I am totally honoured to have another Arnold Schwarzenegger film in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: James Cameron's hard-wired hardware time travel thriller The Terminator was more than the surprise hit of 1984. Made in the pre-video era when young filmmakers could still learn their trade and flex their creative muscles on exploitation films cranked out for quick payoffs in urban theatres and drive-ins, it launched the filmmaking careers of James Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, it gave star Arnold Schwarzenegger serious action movie star credentials and reactivated his foundering Hollywood career, and it added a dynamic entry into the dark subgenre of science-fiction dystopias seen in such films as Blade Runner [1982] and The Road Warrior [1981]. The pace and visceral action recalls the latter and the nocturnal setting and ""tech noir"" stylings echoes the influence of the former, but the contemporary milieu, the clever script and low-budget ingenuity, and James Cameron's own sensibility gives the film an identity all its own.

What started as a fever dream induced hallucination of a towering metallic skeleton rising out of a billowing plume of flames, has now gone on to spawn a franchise of big budget movies, TV shows, theme park attractions, video games, comic books, toys, and merchandise that remain popular and ever-expanding even today. At the heart of it all, though, is still that original, action-packed, dark explosion of science fiction and suspense from 1984. James Cameron's 'The Terminator' is a milestone of its genre, effectively taking inspiration from all that came before, to end up with something refreshingly unique. After nearly thirty years, it continues to be one of the most influential sci-fi thrillers ever made.

For the very few who may not be familiar with the story, the tale follows an average waitress named Sarah Connor [Linda Hamilton], who suddenly becomes the target of an unstoppable, cybernetic killing machine from the future [Arnold Schwarzenegger]. A human soldier, Kyle Reese [Michael Biehn], is also sent to the past, and becomes Connor's only source of protection from the seemingly indestructible Terminator. Together, they flee from the metallic assassin in an exciting, edge-of-your-seat effects-laden spectacle that eventually sees the very fate of humanity hanging in the balance.

Serving as the audience's surrogate, Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor, imbuing the role with a relatable every-woman appeal. Her character's gradual strengthening over the course of the story is handled well, and effectively hints at the more dramatic changes she will endure in the sequel. Michael Biehn is also solid as the brooding, war-weary hero from a dystopian future, and together the pair has decent, but not quite sparkling chemistry. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance has of course become iconic, and no matter how many times it's been parodied or sanitized in later instalments, his cold, intimidating presence still brings an arresting level of true menace to the screen. So much so, that it momentarily purges this memory from my mind.

On the narrative front, James Cameron's script is strong on ideas, but a bit broad on characterisations, something that remains a common trait in much of the director's work. On the plus side, the overarching premise is pure sci-fi gold, brilliantly balancing a classic high concept idea with a surprisingly intimate and self-contained scope. Deeper themes dealing with the concepts of ""man versus machine"" and the violent pitfalls of technology are all potent and remain just as relevant today as when the movie was first released. While the screenplay does wear some clear influences on its sleeve, the film never becomes truly derivative (though, Harlan Ellison would certainly disagree), and quite to the contrary, it has gone on to inform an entire subgenre of science fiction.

As strong as this cybernetic backbone is, some of the finer points of the storytelling process aren't as fully realised, revealing a few clunky quirks in the director's creation. Dialogue (never Cameron's strongest point) can occasionally come across as a little cheesy, stilted, or overly dramatic. Likewise, the performances lose their way a bit, sometimes feeling artificial and forced. With that said, the core of the plotting and character development all still manage to work, creating a solid base for the director to expand upon, giving him free reign to explore the film's real focus big science fiction concepts, exciting action, and kick ass effects.

Through pioneering SFX work and an unrelenting cinematic pace, James Cameron brings an energetic and raw visual style to the proceedings. Though fairly low budget, the self-proclaimed ""king of the world"" rarely lets these monetary limitations show, filling the runtime with speeding chases, massive explosions, and suspenseful shootouts. Stan Winston's visual effects creations have become the stuff of legends, and while a few shots might be slightly dated, the film's make-up still holds up remarkably well. One really gets the sense that this is a work from a young filmmaker who has something to prove, and James Cameron clearly doesn't hold back.

Endlessly re-watchable and effortlessly entertaining, 'The Terminator' is a true staple of the science fiction genre, and a defining example of blockbuster filmmaking. While there are certain weaknesses in the script, the action, effects, and genuine creativity more than make up for any minor shortcomings. Through the story of an emotionless, virtually indestructible monster that will literally stop at nothing to destroy its targets, Cameron is able to tap into some of mankind's most basic fears, creating a visceral and truly frightening ""tech noir"" that hasn't lost any of its terrifying lustre. Even in Hollywood's current climate of massive budget, computer-generated summer tent-poles, 'The Terminator' continues to remind audiences and would-be filmmakers, that all one really needs to create explosive entertainment, is talent, ingenuity, and courage. Well, all that and a really, really big Austrian.

James Cameron gave the film a dark, grungy, ""tech noir"" look, dominated by night scenes and pounding action, and the effects followed suit, creating a vivid world on limited resources. If they don't always look ""realistic"" by the standards of CGI-enhanced modern effects, they are consistently dramatic and imaginative and have a visceral grit to them. Composer Brad Fiedel's percussive electronic score said, ""It was the idea of this mechanical man and his heartbeat,"" he explained in an interview and matched James Cameron's driving pace. Reese shouted out exposition in the heat of action scenes, explaining the history of the future to Sarah Connor while on the run for their lives. The film slowed just enough for audiences to catch their collective breaths and ride the rhythm to the next action sequence, and James Cameron punctuated the tension and the action with witty flourishes and moments of black humour.

Finally, I found this very interesting comment by James Cameron on casting Arnold Schwarzenegger and I thought you would like to read it, and it is as follows: ""Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator, on the other hand, shouldn't have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  It's been a long time coming, but the Blu-ray gods have finally answered our prayers. After several worthless double dips, the film has at last been given a re-mastered video presentation to replace the old, problematic, and oftentimes ugly transfer found on all previous editions. Now provided with a 1080p encoded image in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, with the exception of one possible caveat, this new transfer offers a rather remarkable improvement all across the board. The noticeable damage and wear from the previous versions has all been cleaned away, and the print is now nearly pristine. Thankfully, grain is also better resolved, with a more natural and consistent appearance that's free from the periodically smeary and compressed quality found in the last encode (though it can still look just a tad static in some shots). Clarity is substantially improved as well, and while the movie still shows its gritty, low budget roots, there is now a strong sense of fine detail and dimension that was previously absent. Contrast remains steady, with solid black levels and good shadow delineation. This brings us to the new transfer's most controversial and only potentially off-putting aspect its altered colour timing. Yes, it's true many scenes do offer a comparatively teal hue. With that said, I actually think the adjusted style works pretty well, and while the frequently blue/greenish tinting isn't always appealing, I never found it to be particularly distracting (and I'm not usually a fan of this look). Likewise, the entire runtime isn't completely slathered in teal, and there is some nice pop in bright outdoor scenes. In fact, there are a few shots that actually look a bit more natural than the previous transfer, which occasionally had more of a washed out, faintly magenta/purple push to it. Now of course the question becomes which colour timing is more faithful to the original theatrical presentation and unfortunately, I'm simply in no position to answer that. For what it's worth, this seems to be how James Cameron wants the film to look now, and while some fans are certainly free to disagree, I think the resulting image is quite strong. With a dramatic increase in clarity and depth, this new re-mastered edition of 'The Terminator' offers a cleaner, sharper, and more filmic image. The teal colouring might put off some viewers, but I can't say that it bothered me much. For all intents and purposes, this is a fantastic visual upgrade.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `The Terminator' is now presented in an English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track (as opposed to LPCM), this is the same surround sound mix from the previous releases, and once again the original mono track is nowhere to be found. Dialogue is relatively clean, though there are some slight distortions and crackles in the high frequencies. Surround usage is ample and aggressive, sending laser blasts, explosions, gun shots, and squealing tires all around the room. Unfortunately, the soundstage can actually be a little too vigorous, and some of the directionality and imaging feels unnatural and forced. Likewise, there are balance issues, causing the effects work to overpower the rest of the track. Dynamic range and bass activity are both robust, giving a welcome sense of scale and kick to the action scenes, but neither is on par with contemporary efforts. I find the track to be mostly brilliant and effective, its lack of refinement was much more apparent to me this time around. Likewise, many fans have expressed dismay over its use of re-recorded effects (particularly gunshots) that don't fit as well with the on-screen action. By simply including the original mono mix, this could have been a perfect opportunity for the studio, to not only rectify the film's video issues, but its audio problems as well.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Creating the Terminator: Visual Effects & Music [480i] [13:00] This is a brief but interesting look at the making of the film's special effects, focusing on scenes set in the future, and the tanker truck explosion near the climax of the movie. Interviews with the VFX crew and behind-the-scenes footage are also provided, detailing how miniatures and forced perspective were used in the process. The music is touched upon as well, including an interview with the composer.

Special Feature: Terminator: A Retrospective [480i] [21:00] Here we get a look back at the film's production that mostly consists of a conversation between director James Cameron and star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Topics touched upon include the inspiration for the story, the casting process, crafting the character of The Terminator once Arnold was brought on board, Stan Winston's fantastic makeup and effects, and the success which led to the second film. Though far from ground-breaking, fans that somehow haven't already seen this feature on previous Blu-ray or DVD releases will definitely want to take a look now.

Special Feature: Terminator Scenes [480i] Seven deleted scenes are included here with 1.0 Dolby Digital audio, and are viewable individually. Though most are quick and disposable, there are a few extra bits of development between characters and several hints and setups to plotlines that would be later developed in the sequels and they are as follows:

1. Wholesome Sarah [1:00]; 2. Wrong Sarah [1:00]; 3. Lt. Traxler's Arc [2:00]; 4. Sarah Fights Back [5:00]; 5. Making Bombs [2:00]; 6. Tickling Reese [1:00]; 7. The Factory [1:00]

Finally, 'The Terminator' is a science fiction classic that still holds up remarkably well, serving as a testament to raw, low budget, innovative filmmaking. More than just another repackaging, this release finally offers fans a re-mastered video transfer. With the exception of an occasional teal push that might put off some viewers, the new picture is a sizeable improvement. Unfortunately, though decent, the included 5.1 track retains all of the issues fans have complained about for years, and the mono mix remains missing. Sadly there are no new supplements, but the regurgitated special features are worthwhile (if you haven't already seen them.) While this is an underwhelming release in many respects, the new video transfer really is a large improvement. This isn't the perfect disc many were hoping for, but as far as I'm concerned, it's still a worthy upgrade. Despite this, I am so very pleased I have this particular ultimate upgraded Blu-ray released and I am also so honoured to add this to my ever increasing Arnold Schwarzenegger Blu-ray Collection and until they release an Ultimate Re-mastered Blu-ray, this one is the one to purchase. Highly Recommended!

2134317,5,B0002WYTWG,"I've had some mixed feelings about Terminator 2: Judgment Day over the years. Clearly, it deserved all those awards it won for special visual effects and sound mixing. It was probably one of the very first big-budget CGI projects to look and sound truly great.

I always felt, however, that the material itself--the script and story-line--was just a clumsy rehash of the original. Cameron's point in T1 was that technology is a dehumanizing influence. He felt that if we didn't stop relying so heavily on it, it might lead to the extinction of the human race one way or another. These ideas never put a drag on the story-line or
interfered with the edge-of-your-seat action.

T2 seemed to repeat many ideas and jokes from T1, but with a much heavier hand. T2 gives us many more speeches about how self-destructive human nature is. We also get endless scenes of blazing, roiling infernos and the words Judgment Day in large letters at the center of the screen. There was fire aplenty in T1, too, along with buried hints of judgment and apocalypse, but Cameron had enough confidence in his directing skills to cut to the chase rather than bludgeon us with social commentary.

But I watched it again a few nights ago and I really think Cameron put together a sophisticated film with T2. If the theme of T1 was dystopia and technology, the theme of T2 is appearance and reality. The film's most striking moment to me is when the psychiatrist analyzes Sarah Connor in a conference room. Sarah and the psychiatrist are watching a taped video of her on a TV screen. The camera pulls back to reveal a team of doctors watching the two of them. Finally, the camera stops on a video image of Sarah watching herself on the original TV screen in the conference room. We
have a Chinese box of people watching and being watched.

In addition, during that interview scene, Sarah and the psychiatrist are both lying to each other--neither is what they seem. Before starting the interview, the psychiatrist explains to his colleagues how detailed Sarah's delusions are. Her reasoning appears to be insane, but we in the audience know that the crazy woman is right and the mental health experts are wrong.

Finally, the conflict between the terminators also follows the appearance versus reality theme. Bad Terminator (Robert Patrick) wears a police uniform; Good Terminator (Arnold) wears a black leather biker outfit with dark sunglasses. The Good Terminator was previously a Bad Terminator (or at least a look-alike) in T1. For a while, Sarah and John have trouble figuring out the difference.

I could go on but I won't.

Such great juxtaposition of having what was formerly the evil Terminator Arnold come back in time as a good guy to defend the very same man he was targeting to kill in the previous movie. Such amazing effects with the liquid metal terminator, and so TELLING of how reality functions I might add. And such fantastic action scenes as ALL the actors all play off eachother so... fantastically.

it is a sensual delight. And the funny thing is, it made me want a liquid terminator girlfriend.. oh the things we would do togethe!

Butt I digress. The Director's cut has some pretty telling scenes that demonstrate the nature of the Terminators, one scene in particular shows the liquid terminator fumbling around in John's room, demonstrating the director's vision that the Terminator could not actually 'see' and that it's understanding of areas and buildings was all preloaded like software.

little things like this, all throughout the movie, which added depth to the characters and a perspective for the viewer without adding lines.

And since then, i haven't stopped loving this movie.

To me, it's a lesson in our own history. It's also a lesson in what could happen, and what happens in alternate realities every day.

What did I love about Terminator? First, the introduction of time travel as an element of adding to the possibilities of life. Second, is the concept that robots can and quite possibly are a very real part of our life. Heck, i imagined robot lovers after this movie, which I saw a nearly perfect one in Terminator 3 (Kristanna Loken - wow!) .

My point being. If you're a science fiction fan and futurist as I am. The idea that the future can collide with the present day just boggles the mind, and this is among the first movies - with Time Bandits being another - that demonstrates potential realities and - basic physics concepts - to allow the mind to understand - anything is possible in this amazing reality.

Sure, there are a number of people who would crap on it out of their distaste for special effects, but come on! There is only so much you can accomplish with real live action anyways, so get over it!

Honestly, the way that Arnold was able to maintain a consistent level of indifference with regards to the surrounding action was very convincing that the character he was portraying was a machine that lacked fear, emotion or pain. Probably some of my favorite scenes included the one at the beginning when the terminator clobbered the three punks for their clothes, the shootout at the police station, and the climactic chase scene from the motel to the factory. However, I always skip over the sex scence between Sarah and Kyle. I have always had a distaste for those kind scenes, but that's just me.

Overall, this movie is one of the best science fiction/action masterpieces ever made, even for its time. Now, here I am reviewing it roughly 30 years after it was made. None of the horrible excuses for movies being made today can ever match up to the pure excellence of THE TERMINATOR!

Hasta la Vista Baby became part of our vocabulary in large part because of Arnold's delivery of the phrase.

2134380,5,B0002WYTWG,"Beautifully directed, beautifully written and very well acted, this Sci Fi masterpiece is a must watch for anyone who would call him/herself a ""movie fan"". Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T 800, but this time he's fighting someone his own size, or to be more accurate, someone more advanced than him, the T 1000, a much more advanced Terminator sent from the future to kill John Connor, leader of the human rebellion in a future war against the machine .

One thing I love about this movie is how it played with people's expectations. In the first Terminator movie, Arnold was the bad guy and boy was he scary. The first Terminator is not only a good sci-fi film, but also a good horror movie, and a big part of that was how absolutely terrifying the Terminator was.  This time around they switched things on us. Instead of giving us the same thing one more time with better effects, they changed the dynamics just enough to provide a product that is fresh, packed with action and filled with classic moments that are still being referenced in media to this day. Here, the T 800 is given much more depth as he becomes more human as the movie goes on. By the end of the movie, you'd have to have a heart of stone if you don't get at least a little teary. It is amazing how they managed to humanize a character which, after watching the first movie, would much  likely haunt your dreams rather than tug at your heart strings.

There's very little moments where this movie drags. Most of the time, it's just one great sequence after another great sequence. I can name at least 5 great moments in this film I savor every time I re-watch it. I don't want to spoil anything, just know that you're more than likely to have your own list when you're done.

The movie actually has held up unbelievably well after all these years. Most of the effects still look pretty decent, and the action sequences are top-notch. Granted, there are a few scenes where the effects don't look as good as they once did, but I don't care. The movie involves you so much in its world, I'm willing the forgive that some effects haven't aged very well. However, for the most part, it has aged beautifully.

In conclusion, this one's a certified classic; escapism entertainment at its absolute best. If you were born in the 2000's, or for some miracle have yet to experience this movie, grab a bucket of popcorn, sit back on your couch and enjoy. You won't be disappointed. It is a movie that involves you, shocks you, entertains you, excites you, and by the end...just have an explanation ready to tell whoever you are watching it with as to why all of a sudden your eyes are all watery. If you watch it alone, just let it out, nobody will know.",1400716800,,2720,4.462776659959759

Possibly the best of the 3 movies, but that's up for debate. I think the T-1000 was most brutal of them all, lucky for them they just happened to crash into a iron works, probably the only place that could kill it. Kind of similar to the 1st movie when they happen to go inside an automated factory with a hydraulic press open just enough for them to crawl through and smash the terminator. Perhaps that's the time paradox effect kicking in. The Directors cut includes the scene where they reset his learning capability, a good scene that they cut perhaps just because the movie was a bit too long for their liking. The only part of T2 I didn't enjoy was anytime we were at the funny farm with Sarah and her bad language, and the nuclear bomb nightmare was a bit too much for me, but if that doesn't bother you then you love this movie in its entirety.

The these are great; technology, humanity, our proclivity for war and the AI viewing us as the ultimate threat. We have a fear of technology that is inherent in our nature stemming perhaps from a dislike of things that we can't quite grasp.

The fake Arnold head is very noticeable in the scene where he cuts out his wounded eye, but a good effort as that was the limit of technology in that time.",1400025600,,285,4.296296296296297

Why four stars and not five?  Because the movie is very good, but I don't think it is great.  There are no real surprises,, or mind-bending time travel paradox twists in the plot.  I think Linda Hamilton did a great acting job.  The special effects were good for 1991, but seem a little dated today.  Anyway, I'll probably still watch this again in the future.",1399680000,,621,4.424778761061947
2134396,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator (1984). Released by Orion Pictures, October 26, 1984.
Rated ""R"". Running Time: One hour, 46 mins.
Directed by James Cameron. Written by James Cameron, Gale Anne Hurd, William Wisher Jr.
  This DVD is the 2001 Restored - Special Edition version.
  In the future in 2029 AD in Los Angeles, California, a war of nuclear fire had taken place to exterminate mankind. This had been going on for decades. The machines survived still shooting lasers at any human and destroying them. But that was not the final battle. That would be fought in the future.
  This story begins in the present. It is May 12, 1984 in Los Angeles at 1:52am. With a fierce surge of electricity, a naked, muscular man with a 52 inch wide chest (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is transported into at a construction site. He is from the future.  At Griffith Observatory. he comes across three punks (Brian Thompson, Bill Paxton, Brad Rearden) that make fun of his naked appearance. The punks pull their pocket knives on him and one of the punks stabs him. The man kills one of the punks (Brad Rearden) with his bare fist and it goes right through his body.
  Meanwhile, in an alley near 7th Street, another black hole of electricity appears and another naked man drops to the ground. He is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) from the future. He takes the pants from a derelict (Stan Yale) in the alley and then is seen by the police. Kyle runs and the police chase after him.
  The muscular man is out to find Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a waitress. Kyle is trying to find her too, but to save her life for the future.

Also in the cast: Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Rick Rossovich, Earl Boen, Bess Motta, Dick Miller, Marianne Muellerieile, William Wisher Jr., Franco Columbu, David Hyde Pierce, Tony Mirelez.

Love the original theme score by Brian Fiedel.

1984 was a good time to be living. Ronald Reagan was still our President of the United States. He stood for America, he was Christian and decent and wholesome.
 Los Angeles had the Summer Olympic Games. The Apple Computer was available for our home. Music and movies were fun.

How dare they kill Bess Motta's character, ""Ginger"". How will I ever do my 20 Minute Workout again?

2134398,3,B0002WYTWG,"This was a great and classic flick.  However, my 17 year old thought it sucked.  She somehow did not appreciate the special effects or the 80s clothes and hair.  She also did not appreciate me fast forwarding through the inappropriate parts.",1399420800,,241,4.829268292682927
2134399,5,B0002WYTWG,"One of the greatest stories ever told (Right up there with Star Wars, Indiana Jones & Dragon Ball) made into a movie.
Enough said.",1399334400,,130,4.458333333333333
2134400,5,B0002WYTWG,"For me, this is the greatest action film ever made. Enjoyed the additional scenes in the directors cut which I hadn't seen before. This was the first Amazon prime download viewed on my new Amazon fire and the high quality HD picture surprised me given my max download speed of only 5.3 mps. There were no dropouts or glitches.",1399334400,,326,4.5423728813559325
2134401,4,B0002WYTWG,"It took me a long time to decide how to get the Terminator collection in my blu-ray collection. I LOVE the first 2 Terminators as did almost everybody else on Earth and the 4 star rating has nothing to do with the actual movie, only this release of it. This is the Skynet edition. I have played it on my laptop, my desktop, and my Playstation 3 and since I keep everything up to date I had absolutely no problems playing it, however, they did to much with this and it is almost a pain to navigate the menue. When you choose to play the movie it gives you 3 options, Theatrical version, Extended version (which is the one that was on my special edition DVD when I had it a long time ago, and one that you have to put a code in to see it. I have not looked into this at all and I am sure I will figure it out in a matter of minutes when I want to (which will be soon), but are you kidding me? You want me to unlock something or figure something out to watch a version of the movie?!? Without knowing what this version of the movie even is or anything this gets a star taken away. I want to put a Blu-ray in, select which version of the film I would like to watch and watch it. If I want to do ANYTHING else with a movie (which I never do) that is what the special features is for. I don't want to mess with the stuff. I want to watch one of my favorite movies of all time, nothing else.",1399248000,,1384,3.9113475177304964
2134402,4,B0002WYTWG,"We have a very young Arnold here, and I am honestly not sure how the sequels deal with a robot getting older. But it was a tense, suspenseful race against an unstoppable, implacable foe. The gratuitous nudity was pointless, contributing nothing but pandering to a fine action flick.",1399161600,,282,4.895833333333333

2134405,5,B0002WYTWG,A great flick - full of memorable quotes. Ah-nold is great in this movie about dystopic America in the first of the Terminator series. Not as outright funny as T2 but a great movie.,1398729600,,181,4.352941176470588

2134408,5,B0002WYTWG,"This really set the bar for all movies in it's time, a great example of what a movie should be like.  You have to love Arnolds performance and his one liners.  A definite must see and if you've watched it before, watch it again. Yes it's that good!!!",1398643200,,250,4.1875
2134409,5,B0002WYTWG,Terminator 2 is James Cameron's best work ever. T2 is by far the best one within the Terminator film series.,1398643200,,108,4.45

2134412,2,B0002WYTWG,"This review is for the Skynet Edition and by GOD, pass this turd up if you can. Nothing wrong with the movie, it looks fantastic! However, whatever idiot made the menu system had to have gotten the ideas from Satan! It will take you a minimum of 6ish minutes just to get to the menu to choose your movie. It goes through all this Skynet crap which is only cool the first time. If you have it connected to the internet you get even more crap popping up. If you don't you sit at an error screen reading how you should connect to the internet to benefit from garbage you don't care about.

So when you finally do get to the menu, it doesn't stop there! Now you get to sit through a bunch of short screens that make a bunch of sound to say HEY LOOK GUYS, WE DID SURROUND SOUND WORK YAY. Guess what! You can't skip any of this either!

Bluray has been a huge disappointment with these scenes you can't skip but this one....this one takes the entire cake.",1398470400,,949,4.180327868852459

2134414,5,B0002WYTWG,"There are only a handful of sequels equaling and/or surpassing the original (like Aliens).

For me, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is one of those. I especially enjoyed the Director's Cut. A few additional scenes I feel bonded the storyline a little better.

If you're into action and you don't try to over-analyze things, this is all you need to get away for a while.",1398297600,,365,4.6875
2134415,4,B0002WYTWG,"If you've seen the first movie in the series this is a must see! If you haven't seen the first what are you waiting for?

The story continues in a perfectly logical and well crafted sequel introducing new characters and reinventing original ones. The transformation of Sarah in the years between the films is incredible. James Cameron indeed took a chance with the dream scene with a message so powerful that audiences could accept the horrifying images of children turned to ashes!

I would have given the movie 5 stars however the ""Director's Cut"" adds scenes which I feel slow the movie down and others that have less impact then the theatrical version.",1398297600,,656,4.79646017699115
2134416,5,B0002WYTWG,"I bought this Blu-ray because the one that comes with the terminator anthology set is an older Blu-ray, I think it was from 2007 and is no better than a poor DVD, the picture quality and sound for this new 2013 Blu-ray are fantastic.",1398297600,,233,4.318181818181818

2134422,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is one of James Cameron's most influential works. Non-stop action, a thrilling score, and incredible special effects all come together in harmony in this heart-pounding Sci-Fi/Action thriller. I'd recommend this to any action movie lover, and due to its bleak style and dark portrayal of its title character, the Terminator, I'd maybe even recommend this to any horror fan as well.",1397952000,,396,5.301587301587301

2134427,5,B0002WYTWG,"This movie plants the seed of James Cameron's visionary story of our own destruction, how hero's and heroine's are born and ""the future is not set"".

In spite of the early CGI limitations it's the story that carries the viewer to a world imagined having taken the wrong path. A look at what could happen if our society turns a blind eye to the reliance on technology without consideration of what it can cost.

If you've seen and enjoyed the sequel T2 without having the original as a reference it might be hard to understand Sarah Connor's outrageous and manic behavior.  Carried solely by the action and advancements in CGI T2 is very entertaining but the arc of the story is missing.

I'm so glad the master was restored in this HD format. Many years ago I bought a VHS version that was grainy and the player could barely keep on track. It was painful to watch even though I knew the story so well I could almost but not quite forgive the producers for releasing such a poor copy.",1397606400,,983,4.444444444444445

The fact that so many scenes, dialogue, expressions and action sequences have become almost routine in movies and spoofs of movies since this one was release attests to lasting quality and imagery.

2134440,3,B0002WYTWG,"This is a very slightly longer version of the theatrical release. Although it's still rated PG-13, there is quite a bit more profanity (including f-word) so keep that in mind if you are watching it with your kids. None of the additional scenes really make a huge difference, which I imagine is why they were edited out, but Cameron apparently thought they were worth including.

Some additional scenes I remember:
- Sarah getting beaten and tasered in her room in the mental hospital (you don't feel as bad when she lays out the orderly with a broomstick later on)
- A scene where Sarah dreams that Kyle comes back to her to warn of the impending T-1000 attack. This leads straight to the first playground dream scene.
- Arnold getting his brain switched from ""read-only"" mode to ""learn"" mode adter they excape from the hospital.
- John teaching Arnold to try to smile.
- A daytime family scene at Miles' house. He has a daughter in this scene, although she doesn't ever appear during the shootout. Heavy sleeper, I guess?
- Miles destroying his working prototype at the lab using an ax.

Again, nothing that significantly changes the plot. Probably 3-5 minutes of extra footage in all.",1397088000,,1186,4.72463768115942

2134451,3,B0002WYTWG,"Look, I don't really need to sell you on Terminator 2. The movie is probably one of the best action/popcorn movies ever made, and is a pioneer visually. If you haven't seen it yet, then you should definitely buy it in some format or another.

This blu-ray set though...

Look, the quality of the picture and sound is fine. I really don't have complaints there. However, let me explain what happened when I went to try and play this disc in my PS3. First, it installed a bunch of data, or downloaded it - not really sure - and that took about a minute or so. Most discs show me a small loading screen the first time I put them in of about fifteen seconds or less. After it did that, it loaded up a ""Skynet"" location tracker or some trivial nonsense. This thing froze on a map of the US for about thirty seconds or so before I thought my disc was broken and tried rebooting it. Then I loaded it up again, it froze there again, and I quickly searched the house trying to find my receipt. After about a minute of idling and not touching the system after I thought it froze, it suddenly sparked to life again, trying to freak me out with ""Skynet"" location statistics, but it doesn't seem like it was able to get a good grasp or any info of where I was. The only option you have is ""Continue."" You hit that, and FINALLY you can go to the main menu, where you can choose which version of the movie you want to watch. Your options are ""Theatrical"" ""Special Edition"" and then ""*****"" which says you can't unlock it unless you punch in the secret code. Where's the secret code? I have no clue, probably at the end of some special feature or possibly it flashes on the screen after you watch the movie once in Theatrical mode - probably some stupid thing like that. Without spoiling it, I googled the answer (Which, if you're mad that I'm not sharing the secret code, you can easily Google it yourself), and punched in the code to be treated to my third option now being for an ""Extended Special Edition"" which was 3 minutes longer than the Special Edition.

The fact that there's three cuts of the movie - no complaints. I like that, I like to compare and contrast and what have you. The fact that the third cut is only accessible when you punch a stupid code - That's something that would be cool to unlock a gag reel or something, but another cut of the movie new to blu-ray or any other format? That's just cruel. And stupid.

Then, on top of all this, the Extended Special Edition has 80 CHAPTERS programmed into it. Know what I use chapters for? To know around which part I might have stopped a movie so I can skip ahead. This is convenient for me. It becomes inconvenient when there's 80 chapters, meaning almost every chapter is about a minutes and some change long. One chapter near the middle of the movie was only about forty seconds long. What's the point of that? I could hit fast-forward and get there faster.

Whoever designed the DVD menu and the chapter layout must truly sympathize with the Terminators as all it seems designed to do is inflict anger and despair from humans interacting with it. I give them points for creativity and effort, but when the effort and ideas go into things that stop people from enjoying their disc or being able to utilize its features, then it's production for production's sake and nobody benefits from it. So I really hate how clunky and dumb the menus are in this release. Everything else - excellent. Special features, commentary, sound and picture quality - all good there. Menus? Chapters? They can go right to hell.",1396483200,,3561,4.41400304414003

Accessing the movie is simple but I still can't find any of the promised 8 hours of bonus features. The drop down menu icons are not easy to navigate and the last one takes you to some Bluray Live page that takes another minute to load. And there, more crap menus that take you knowhere, hang, or say no classified access. Even the picture in picture add-ons to the movie didn't play and I have a strong internet connection. Here's how it works, you click on a tab for a feature and then play the movie, not really knowing what the hell you've just clicked or how it will function. If wrong, you have to go back. But it doesn't end there as more menus appeared during the movie with more vague tabs that said things like, ""Access Protocol"" or some crap. Why they couldn't just have all the features on a simple tab is beyond me. It's like that friend who never knows when to stop until he gets arrested. This Bluray is a pain.

2134466,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is a great piece of Sci-Fi, and provides great action sequences, but it's not the star.  This is clearly Sarah's movie

At the beginning Sarah is just a girl.  A waitress with a silly roommate.  All she cared about was clothes and boys.  She'd never really been through anything.

Things change for her when she hears a news report about 2 women being killed, both who were named Sarah Connor.  Afraid for her life she ducks into a Bar and calls the police.  She is mistakenly told she'd be safe as long as she stays visible in a public place.  Next thing she knows she's attacked and then in the middle of a shoot out.  Her attacker was blasted several times with a shotgun and it did little more than knock him down.

She and her protector run.  Sarah learns much after that.  Who her protector is - Sargent Reese.  What her attacker is - a Terminator from the future, and why it wanted to kill her.

The History of what was to come tells of a Nuclear War.  An automated military defense system, code-named Skynet, had become self aware and declared war on the human race.  The survivors were scattered, hunted, or rounded up.  Skynet's machines ran night and day.  The human race was close to extinction.  But there was one man who taught them to fight, to storm the camps, to smash the machines into junk.  He turned it around.  He was a legend, a savior, a leader.

That man's name was Connor - John Connor.  Sarah was fated to be the mother of the world's greatest leader.  The Terminator wanted to kill her to prevent John from ever even being conceived.

Next the police capture Reese, and take Sarah.  They offer her their explanations of what she'd seen.  Assuming the Terminator had been wearing body armor and had been on drugs.  To their minds Reese was their killer and a lunatic.

They come close to convincing Sarah.  Then the Terminator attacks the Station.  Gun fire erupts from all directions, dozens of cops are shot. The attack lets Reese break free and rejoin Sarah.  Though he gets shot in the process.

Once they were far enough away they spend the night hiding out.  Sarah bandages Reese's wound.  Her first field dressing.  Throughout the night she hears more about John and the legend she herself will become.  She starts using Reese's first name, Kyle, after he gives her a message from John.

They make their way to a motel.  Kyle buys supplies, which they use to create homemade explosives. Following that,  Kyle's stories of the war touch Sarah.  She falls for him, and they spend a night making love.

Almost immediately after they finish the Terminator arrives.  Chasing them through the streets on a motorcycle.  That ends with their vehicle wrecked, and it's motorcycle destroyed.  Next thing Sarah knows it had hijacked a gasoline truck, and is coming to run her over.  Splitting up Sarah runs, while Kyle manages to plant an explosive on the truck.  The flames engulf the truck and the Terminator.

Kyle was wounded but alive.  Sarah and Kyle embrace, thinking it was over.  Then from the flames the true Terminator emerges.  It's clothing and skin incinerated.  Finally Sarah sees her enemy for what it really is.  A metal Skeleton.  It was damaged.  One leg almost useless, and it speed reduced.  But it was still coming and still lethal.

Running scared they break into the nearest building, an industrial factory.  Kyle activates as many machines as possible, to make tracking them harder.  Then he collapses from his injuries. Finally touching the strength inside her, Sarah re-motivates him by ordering the soldier Reese back on his feet.

In his final battle Reese keeps himself between Sarah and the Terminator, before planting an explosive within it's lower chest.  The blast blows the Terminator in half, and sends shrapnel in ever direction.  Sarah catches a piece in her leg, and Kyle is killed.

Sarah was holding Kyle's body when the Skeleton's upper body reached for her.  It had been playing dead, hoping she'd come for Kyle.  Sarah couldn't stand on her leg, and the Terminator no longer had legs.  Each could only crawl.  Eventually Sarah is cornered, the Terminator's hand reaching for her.

Then she realizes what she'd just crawled through.  A massive industrial press.  As she reached for the activation switch she changes.  Her speech patterns, her facial expression, the look in her eyes, and her entire entire body language shifts.  Taking on the form that Kyle, and the Resistance used.  Finally revealing the Warrioress she was fated to be.

Activating the press flattened the skeleton, and shattered it's CPU.  The Terminator was at last Terminated.

In the epilogue Sarah was pregnant.  Her mind struggling with the paradox.  Eventually her son would have to send his father on a mission, knowing Kyle would die in the end.

She'd learned about the future from Kyle.  When Skynet rose John would be ready, and so would she.  Kyle would not have died in vain.  She would never stop fighting.  Her war had just begun.",1395273600,,4996,4.739485981308412

""The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire.  Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future.

It would be fought here, in our present.

Tonight.""

This is what appears on-screen at the beginning of this exhilarating  sci-fi action movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Bien, and Linda Hamilton.  It was directed by James Cameron.

A cyborg assassin, a Terminator or a T-100, Model 101 (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Hamilton).  Kyle Reese (Bien) is the human soldier from the future who is sent back to protect Sarah from the T-100.

What makes this movie so appealing (to me at least) is the story.  It's a well-executed science fiction movie with plenty of action.  Bien and Hamilton actually make the story work with Schwarzenegger looking the part of a menacing human-shaped, indestructible robot.

Schwarzenegger speaks 76 words in this movie--many with an Austrian accent!

Schwarzenegger, as well, does not appear in this film's last 15 minutes.

However, the public was mesmerized with his part and, as they say, the rest is history,

Both the special effects and background music add to each scene.

This film was not expected to be either a commercial or critical success, but it topped the box office for two weeks and helped launch the career of Cameron and solidify that of Schwarzenegger.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2007) has only one extra: a theatrical trailer.

In conclusion, this is the movie to see if you appreciate good science fiction!!

(1984;  1 hr, 43 min excluding end credits; 28 scenes;  wide screen, rated 'R')

2134518,4,B0002WYTWG,"I bought a previous version of Terminator on Blu-ray, and it was awful.  It looked no better than the muddy old DVD.  This updated version, however, gets an unqualified recommendation.  The picture typically looks just about brand new, with a cooler color scheme that pulls back on the pinks/ reds from previous versions and matches T2.  The red and blue Tech Noir encounter still looks less than stellar, but new detail can be found everywhere in the film, and the print is pristine.  There's no saving the optical effects (they'll get around to it eventually if the elements still exist), and that latex Arnold head isn't any more convincing in HD, but it's safe to say Terminator looks better than it ever has before.  I'm giving this disc 4/5 because a) all the special features are in SD and were in the older versions, and b) you can bet that a new disc with new HD extras is just around the corner.  Highly recommended.",1391126400,,926,4.609756097560975
2134519,5,B0002WYTWG,"i'm a big fan of James cameron's sci-fi classic thriller which a few scenes are sci-fact now
especially the last few scenes with the endo skeleton
as the world gets closer to the future, as years go by with new advanced technology
the medical-science world is getting closer to making robotic limbs and arms for humans
which is either frightening or something to look forward to, everyone will have opinions about it

after having the special edition dvd for all these years i finally bought the blu-ray version
i thought it was definitely time for an upgrade to HD surround sound with today's technology
there are 2 blu-ray versions the 2006 release and this new 2013 release
i bought the 2013 re-issue by MGM and it was a wise decision for sure.
the widescreen picture looks beautiful and clear for a HD transfer
the audio quality is pretty Good aswell still in 5.1 surround sound but could've been boosted up to 6.1.

the special features suck, only some of the special features have been brought over
from the original special edition dvd from 2003
the usual 25mins retrospective interview with only James and Arnold
and the special effects and music segment from the Other voices Documentary are included
which only goes for 15mins
and the Deleted scenes are here aswell, but that's all
the Other voices Doco is not on this blu-ray for some reason

very very dispointing effort by MGM, there was no reason why they could not include
all the special features from the dvd release
especially the 1hr long Other voices Documentary
 which has interviews with nearly all the cast and crew from the film
it's a better making of Doco than the 25mins retrospective.
maybe MGM couldn't be bothered to add the 1hr Doco from the DVD release

so it looks like i have to keep my special edition dvd release just for the special features really
i was going to throw it out cause the print on the blu-ray looks Great better than the dvd version
and if all the special features from the dvd were on this blu-ray there would be no point keeping the dvd

so if you still love to watch all the special features from the DVD release, keep it
cause only some of the extras from the dvd are on this blu-ray
but the HD transfer of the film looks beautiful and clear
so i gave this 2013 re-issue blu-ray 5 stars only cause of the new HD transfer which looks amazing
but the special features suck.",1390953600,,2377,4.555035128805621

TERMINATOR II: JUDGEMENT DAY is a legitimate sequel: there's more story to tell about a hulking, leather-clad android (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who arrives from the future to protect a rebellious teenager and future leader (Edward Furlong) from being killed by the tenacious T-1000 robot (Robert Patrick), whose liquid-metal construction makes him seemingly unstoppable.

The fate of the future lies in the balance, with Linda Hamilton (who would later marry her director) reprising her role as the rugged woman Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton)whose son will change the course of history.

2134564,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator meshed elements of science fiction, horror and action like few movies before or since. James Cameron worked with a relatively low budget and made a masterpiece that's still watchable today - many of the concepts (such as military equipment becoming automated) are already starting to happen, and the message of becoming too dependent on technology could be even more relevant today than in 1984.

Unlike Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the first movie has only been released a few times in the past, including once before on Blu-Ray (around 2006). I thought the previous release looked fine, but this ""remastered"" edition is superior, with a much sharper and richer picture overall. I was worried when I read about Cameron's requested color re-timing (apparently they tinted certain scenes to look more blue in this release), but it's barely noticeable and fits the scenes where it's used (mainly in the blue walls of the parking garages, the police station, and the concrete barrier Kyle and Sarah hide in after escaping from the station). I watched T2 right after this and was impressed at how much more consistent they looked together (T2 was shot with a lot of blue-hued scenes originally).

Having said that, this release has its own problems ; sometimes one scene will be totally clear while the next will have a lot of grain; at least once or twice, certain scenes looked to have too much DNR applied (where the whole screen looked smeared and lost detail). Also, I wished they fixed the parts of the image where rear-projection was used, as those shots still look really out of place (they could have just darkened those parts to match the rest of the action but chose to leave them alone instead). I guess there's only so much they would do though, as the movie is almost 30 years old and the only alternative in places would be to use CGI to replace things (which I'm glad they didn't do!).

The audio doesn't include the original sound mix, but the one that is here is very nice, with great effects during the gun battles and car crashes. The score still sounds great, too.

Overall, I'm happy with the upgrade; a commentary with Cameron (and maybe some of the stars, model makers, etc) would have been nice, but there is a nice retrospective and interesting deleted scenes on the disc. Recommended (along with the Skynet edition of T2).",1387065600,,2359,4.788697788697789

2134588,4,B0002WYTWG,"I'm not too big on the gratuitous swearing or the blood and guts in it, my main reason for liking it so much is Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor. To me it's what a female action hero should be. She's smart, ruthless, tough, and they actually have her get her hair messed up. If they made her a villain, she'd be even scarier than she already is. I like that they have her doing exercises to stay fit and get sweaty doing so. And to those who say she's not 'feminine', she's a mother. What's more 'feminine/womanly' than that? That's actually her whole focus, protecting her son.

As to the special features, I haven't watched them all yet, I will say though that the review that said there was only one version of the movie on disc 1 is wrong. There is the theatrical version and the special edition. I have watched both, but I will not watch the special/uncut version again, some of the scenes I didn't like. The booklet was a welcome surprise, I didn't know there was one included. The metal casing is also nice, because I have 2 very inquisitive Siamese kittens.

2134591,5,B0002WYTWG,"It goes without saying James Cameron's 1984 Terminator is one of the most iconic sci-fi thrillers ever made (even selected by the Library of Congress for preservation!), and this masterpiece has been hurting for a decent Blu-ray release for quite some time now! Now I'm not going to go into the details of this movie, as countless other reviewers already have done so. Instead my review is going to focus on the quality of this new release. I, like many of you out there have held out from buying this on Blu-ray after hearing about how the other releases didn't do this movie justice, that's finally been remedied with this 2013 release! As other viewers have already stated the biggest difference with this release is the new color timing given to the film. No longer does the movie have that infamous ""red push"", instead the film has been given a cooler more natural color timing, which makes the movie look even more timeless. If you look at pictures of the old color timing of this movie, and the one from this release, it is a definite improvement. As for the sharpness and clarity of the picture, I have to say Terminator has never looked better! In previous releases (including the special edition DVD release years ago) some details appeared fuzzy and hard to make out, not with this release! You can make out very fine details with crystal clarity, such as the Police ID badges Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen's characters wear in the movie. This release has the 5.1 Dolby stereo mix which was done for the special edition DVD (done by Skywalker sound and supervised by James Cameron, who always wanted this film to have a stereo mix, but Orion pictures said no and gave the movie a cheaper mono sound mix). There's a lot of mixed feelings out there about this, as a die-hard fan of the franchise who grew up watching the first two films, hearing the stereo remix for the first time felt really weird to me, but after a while the 5.1 mix grew on me. There are directional sound effects, which are very apparent during the gun fight scenes. While the sound effects now sound crisp and modern, the music has unfortunately suffered in this 5.1 mix, as Brad Fidel's iconic score for this movie was reproduced by Skywalker sound (instead of having him re-record the soundtrack himself in stereo), and there is indeed a lack of verisimilitude to his original score done for the original mono release. In my opinion this movie would benefit greatly from a new 5.1 mix with the soundtrack done right! Hopefully next time they can get Brad himself to re-record the soundtrack in stereo! I do agree with other reviewers they should have included the original mono soundtrack with this release, but it's not that big of a deal for me (it might be for some fans out there however). A small nitpick I do have with this release is the lack of a dedicated menu. This movie has what's known as a ""pop up"" menu, which is a simple menu selection screen that ""pops"" during the movie when you push the up arrow key on your remote. For a movie as iconic as The Terminator, you'd think they could have designed a snazzy menu screen for this release. Overall though it's the playback of the movie that counts the most right? And with the newly remastered picture I give this movie and this 2013 Blu-ray release 5 stars! Of all the releases of this movie to date, this is the one to own.",1383436800,,3375,4.561779242174629

2134593,1,B0002WYTWG,"Be warned: The reviews on this page praising the plethora of behind-the-scenes featurettes refer to out-of-print DVD editions, NOT the single-disc Blu-Ray you see on this page.

The Skynet Blu-ray contains NONE of the many documentaries and behind-the-scenes features found on previous T2 releases.  For those, you will have to seek out an old standard-definition DVD release.  This Blu-ray contains only the ""Special Edition"" director's cut and two commentary tracks (1993 & 2003).  Besides that, the menus are annoying and painfully slow to load.

The picture quality is adequate but substandard for a Blu-ray release, probably owing to excessive grain reduction and the fact that the theatrical aspect ratio was created from a ""soft crop"" of the taller 35mm negative.  Fans of the old DVD and Laserdisc special features recall a one-of-a-kind demonstration of how the pan-and-scan (4:3) home video crop included more vertical picture (but slightly less width) than the theatrical crop.  This was common filming practice during the VHS era.  One would have hoped the Blu-ray transfer to restore the lost height, instead of replacing it with rasterized black bars and 25% wasted resolution (turning 1920x1080 into 1920x816), but no such luck.",1383264000,,1243,5.371134020618556

The repeated dream sequence of a nuclear holocaust blasting a playground.  Idk, it just got old and tiresome.

The obvious plot busters:  He's missing an arm NOW, its stuck in the machine over there....and you throw the arm from the past into the molten steel to destroy it....but that's just one arm...there are two arms!  Go get the other ARM.  That's you're whole purpose, to destroy the materials that can later be used to build skynet...and you forget the other arm?

2134611,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator begins with 2 beings coming from the future through a lightning/energy technique. One of them is a human being (who manages to be hot as hell), and the other is a buff, no s*** taking, assassin cyborg (who manages to be completely naked). The robot from hell has been sent to destroy a young woman who will later get pregnant and give birth to a male that will become an enemy of machines.  In the future once they have taken over, he will lead the fight against them. The other man is a more soft hearted soul that comes from that time when the world has been destroyed, yet he was sent by the son as an adult that right now is not yet born or even conceived, to save his mother so she can have him. Capiche? Good.
The Terminator is a film that is highly coated with style, morbid moments and pure delicious destruction - I love it! In the Terminator series, this one's my favorite, and yes I know I stand out from the crowd in saying that. Curious as to why? Read my review of Terminator 2 for explanation. While the second boasted some clever humor and a bonding between robot and child, here we have as simple fathering of kill and run, kill and fight, or be destroyed. Pure adrenaline heaven. Besides all this we get a nice little love story on the side, a tragedy that would rival a Shakespeare story, and true endearing human emotion.

My favorite aspect of this movie is that it's bleak as hell. The scene that stands out the most is when  Biehn's character, Reese, is recounting how in the future they are able to sniff out robots by using dogs. The scene where the dogs started barking and they just knew their hiding hole has been found was creepy as hell. Great directing there, and  just one reason I hold the first terminator close to my heart.

Arnold is at the top of his game. You can tell he's putting his all into this role (and showing it all!) Linda Hamilton is sweet and reluctant, playing the role up to a helm.  Biehn is gorgeous and also shows us the right side of him when it counts. There were some truly enjoyable small parts for unknowns back then, such as Bill Paxton with the blue hair, Lance Henriksen as a cop, and Dick Miller discussing home defense. Great gathering!

If any flaws exist, it's that the effects look rather cheesy with today's standards. However, I think having a lower budget helped this movie more than it hurt. (How familiar is that saying lately?) It's always true it seems. You have to wok with more creativity when you less cash to pass around.

The eclectic score from Brad Fiedel is amazing; it's heart pounding and perfectly tuned into the flick. The relationship between Hamilton and  Biehn ups this from being just another action film. I classify it as horror as that's in there -- it's a great, almost seamless blend of several genres (sci-fi, horror, action, drama, romance)

Overall an amazing movie that shouldn't be missed. The Terminator is now an American icon of sorts, as it  should be. Let's just hope that the message behind this film doesn't come true as we keep advancing toward technology at an alarming rate, not looking before we leap and considering the potential ramifications. The social commentary is both true and well received by yours truly. I read an article recently where they are using computer chips and human brain cells together.

This is perhaps the best restoration of the film, offering the best Blu-Ray value for the film collector.

2134623,4,B0002WYTWG,This Blu-ray is the new remaster of The Terminator.  It's worth the upgrade for the picture quality alone--but I'm not getting rid of my older Blu-ray for two reasons:  One-the older Blu-ray is grainier and rougher looking (exactly the way the film looked in the cinema in 1984) and Two-the new remaster does NOT have the original mono mix.  I'm normally not so picky about audio mixes but the original mono mix is the only version where the metallic scraping can be heard in the music.  All remastered audio versions of this movie's soundtrack have mixed the scraping out.  The original mono should ALWAYS be offered!  But the picture quality on this new disc is to DIE for!

Despite it's outdated special effects and cheesy car chases, the Terminator remains as terrifying today as it was in 1984.

I wanna talk about the disk itself; first off, for Blu-Ray, I was never really blown away by the picture quality, it seemed like a really high quality DVD than Blu-Ray. Minor note; this might be a stupid thing to complain about, but for me, the menus seemed a bit cumbersome to navigate. Lastly, the most striking thing about this disk is the absolute lack of any special features, aside from 2 different commentary tracks. Is there really not any material to include? With this film, you could have a 2 hour special just on the effects, not to mention actor interviews and deleted scenes. That's the worst, cause I know there are tons of deleted scenes.",1376438400,,757,4.607407407407408

2134640,5,B0002WYTWG,"I've been a huge fan of Terminator 2: Judgement Day since its initial release on VHS back in 1991. It was the most revolutionary movie I had ever seen at the time, and it (coupled with ""Jurassic Park"" which would be released 2 years later) would go on to change film industry as we knew it. The movie itself is a classic of the Sci-Fi/Action genre, and I would argue is BETTER than it's predecessor, the original ""The Terminator"" (1984). It stands teh test of time and is just as relevant, mesmerizing, and engaging today as it was over 20 years ago.

I have owned several releases of this film spanning many different formats of media, but I have to say that this newest release, the Skynet Edition, is by far and away one of the nicest looking Blu Ray transfers I have ever seen. The picture is sharp and the colors are rich. It looks like a movie that was released a year ago. Simnply put, the picture is immaculate, and really holds it own on 1080P HD.",1376265600,,956,4.340782122905028
2134641,5,B0002WYTWG,"Ah, yes The Terminator, a name that many are familiar with. The Terminator has become a major franchise that has spawned three sequels, and several video games, and has even spawned action figures for collectors to keep as memorabilia of such a great film. It is basically about a cyborg sent from the future to the present to locate a woman and destroy her, so the future can be altered to the antagonist's liking. The special effects are pretty advanced for the time, considering that this was made in 1984, when computers were not as advanced as they are today. There is no reason for any Sci-Fi fan to miss out on this classic, The Terminator is really a one of a kind film.",1376265600,,678,4.475806451612903
2134642,4,B0002WYTWG,It's The Terminator. Arnold being menacing with few words. Practical special effects. 80s synth music and all.  Could have stopped the franchise here.,1376179200,,150,5.521739130434782
2134643,5,B0002WYTWG,"If you read my original review of THE TERMINATOR on blu-ray, you remember that I made one thing clear. The 5-Star Review of the film was for the movie, NOT the blu-ray version. I complained that the picture and sound quality of that blu-ray edition were no better than my DVD Special Edition. I focused my review on the movie, itself and stated that the film was in need for a SERIOUS remastering job.

I know I'm not the only one who complained of that Blu-Ray edition, and those complaints have been answered!!! This new edition on Blu-Ray is a MAJOR improvement, both in picture and sound. It looks so much better now. And the new DTS 5.1 sound is an even bigger improvement.

If you haven't read my original review of THE TERMINATOR on Blu-Ray and want to know why I loved that movie so much, it's still here on Amazon.com. Just look up all the reviews that I have written.

I wouldn't be too surprised if in 2014 a 30th Anniversary Edition is released. If they do, I have a wish-list of bonuses on blu-ray: A new commentary by James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a 30th Anniversary reunion of the cast and crew, and a tribute to Stan Winston, who did truly amazing work on the film.",1376092800,,1192,4.433789954337899

It's too bad that Edward furlong didn't really have an acting career after this movie. He played the part well. I have all the terminator movies except for salvation. I really didn't liked that movie. It was such a shame too being that all the others before were good movies. the shipping on this movie was fast, so that was a plus. overall  I give it four stars; very rarely do I give five star reviews. I ordered this movie to complete my set, with the exception of salvation of course. I had it on vhs but all the others i owned were on dvd.",1375401600,,692,4.125925925925926

2134662,5,B0002WYTWG,"Perhaps it was because this was the director's cut, but the T-800 (Arnold) had significantly more personality. I suppose this made then ending somewhat more poignant.

Acting skill is not required to star or be featured, just the ability to seem to be doing all these stunts and to give voice to the occasional few words or sentences without falling on your  face. This these performers do. The rest is action and more action. I found the whole enjoyable though not materially better than many films of the same genre. Coming in at just under 150 minutes, it is a lot to bear with all at once. The time goes fast, however.
Much too late to make a serious recommendation: but, here goes, any action fan who wants no conceptual or emotional problems with a movie, will find this one entertaining.",1374105600,,728,4.385185185185185

The scenes that were added back help round out the Terminator's background, tell more about the designer who unwittingly laid the groundwork for his creation, and explain the overall situation more thoroughly. The original version was 108 minutes, and this version 154 minutes - so nearly an hour more to see. This is my preferred version of the movie, and I think it will be, too, for most Terminator fans.",1373587200,,466,4.8375

We tried the Netflix version, which had a better audio, but still too low.  Then I remembered that we had the DVD with THX and watched that instead.  Even though it was not a Blu-ray, the audio was excellent.

Writer/director James Cameron's original Terminator film has Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg sent back in time to 1984. He's programmed to kill Sarah Connor before she can give birth to a son who is destined to lead survivors in a post-apocalyptic war against a self-aware computer network and its army of killing machines.

THE TERMINATOR was a huge summer hit, grossing $78 million worldwide in first run vs. a $6 million cost. Its sequel, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was long in coming, but well-worth the seven year wait. In almost every respect, this sci-fi thriller surpasses its predecessor. The concept of TWO terminators in the story equalling twice the film just may be true, thanks in large part to Robert Patrick's grimly determined T-1000 prototype, a superior poly-alloy mechanism capable of morphing into anybody (or thing?).

Sarah (Linda Hamilton), who was understandably confused and terrified in the first movie is now confident, buff from working out, and ready for the coming conflagration. Her only obstacle is confinement in a prison-like psych ward. Arnold returns as Cyberdyne model 101, but this time his mission is to protect, not kill Sarah, and especially young John (Edward Furlong). Again, the unseen adult John is trying to make sure he lives in the pre-machine war past, and Arnold is his weapon and shield against a superior cyborg. The battle between the two terminators is epic and to the death, but first, Sarah must be freed.

""T2"" is enhanced by brilliant Industrial Light & Magic special effects and the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston. The pace is breathless, the sense of danger unflagging, and the action, mesmerizing.

2134729,1,B0002WYTWG,"First off, the picture is the same as the Extreme DVD release from TEN years ago.. Same clarity.. The special features - OVER 8 HOURS (as the Blu Ray Case Describes) aren't there.. When you first insert the disc, unless you have an internet connection (which I do) and an SD card slot and card inserted for downloads (which I do not - not on this device), you get an error message from Skynet stating ""not enough memory"".. So, you've already wasted 30 seconds after inserting the disc.. You hit cancel and the Lionsgate intro plays (now a minute has wasted), now since there's no sd card inserted the menu said ""Not Available"" all over it. You select the minimal features they do have  - trailers mostly. 2 versions of the film: theatrical and extended..and 2 commentaries, all of which are on the Extreme and Ultimate DVD versions... I forwarded to the chapter where John is being asked by his foster mom to clean up his room (cause I wanted a daylight scene)... Checked it and it's the SAME AS THE ENHANCED DVD... Same quality..

My problem here is in three parts: 1) Blu Ray was touted to have all this space to hold hours upon hours of special features, far beyond a single DVD.. From what I remember, they were saying between 3- 5 DVD's worth of content could be stored on a single Blu Ray Disc, however, the special features on a typical Blu Ray are minimal at best, and I've yet to find a Blu Ray where it contains all of the same features as the DVD, let alone, more.. It's always less.. But yet, the studios have no problem issuing these two disc Blu Ray sets, with nothing on them..I know that's just a smoke and mirrors trick to make you think it's a big deal... 2) The picture has been remastered in high definition on DVD, so, really, there's nothing new here... and 3) The fact that I need memory or an internet connection for a friggin' disc to work is INSANE.. I bought the disc, I put it in, it should start up. Blu Ray was supposed to have this fast start technology and feature, however every Blu disc that I have (116 so far) takes it's sweet time, and you can't forward past intros, warnings or menus.. And my Player is a new Sony unit..also, it's kinda creepy that it needs to contact a mainframe in the first five seconds.. otherwise you don't get what's advertised on the package.. Universal Blu Rays have done this too (Casino, the Thing, etc.)..

Another note on Blu Ray's operation, the discs are supposed to be more durable than DVD, yet I had a smudge on a new disc and the player froze twice. With DVD, if you turn the power off, it'll remember your place..HA, not with Blu Ray, make a mistake by accidentally hitting the power or ""home"", and the whole disc needs to restart like as if you had just hit eject... Then there's the issue of DVD's that weren't produced and formatted for 16x9 screens, 1.85:1 looks criminal by reducing the picture to a widescreen within a 1.33 frame, yet I put in in my up convert Toshiba DVD, and it still fills out at 1.85:1... (T2 is 2.35:1, I know)and if not, I could usually adjust my HDTV's H/V Positions to resize it, this is not available when using the Sony Blu Ray & there's no zoom either... I dunno if this is just the Sony machine that I have, but overall, it's not worth the hassle. And with close to 3,000 DVD's, I'm not rebuying everything, I only intended to upgrade the necessities.

So my main point is, if you have an older DVD version of T2, stick with it, trust me, they did a great job on these two particular DVD's; they were testaments to what DVD could do back in the day and were held in high regard.. The Extreme DVD even had a 1080p mastered version of the Theatrical version in that package..and that was 2003.. So for the Skynet Edition I'm only out $5. It was brand new, but I won't be keeping it because of all the unnecessary drama you have to go through before it allows you to select the movie - which I guess is why it was $5, no one else bought it either..... In my humble opinion, and 116 discs later & into this game, Blu is a BIG Bust..Long live DVD.. Oh, and a similar thing occurred on the Reservoir Dogs 15th Anniversary Edition Blu, but that's elsewhere in another review.",1369785600,,4177,4.351282051282051

Couldn't complain at all, really. Some minor film grain is evident, but really though you'll see that in some 80's movies. I've read some notes about a teal color in the picture, but I've seen VHS and DVD versions and I can't say I've seen that.
Of course, that isn't to say it isn't there, but anyways moving on..

Sound, stellar. I'm not too familiar with the whole 5.1/7.1 sound thing, but I can say it definitely sounds better than the previous versions of the movie I've had.

All in all, for the price you can't go wrong. Great action flick, great story and Linda Hamilton is in it (slight crush)...just..that 80's hair.. lol

So yeah, give the movie a shot. I got this at $7.00 or so on Amazon, and for a Blu Ray that ain't bad!",1369353600,,759,4.368794326241135

2134736,5,B0002WYTWG,"There are tons of movie reviews, so if you want to know about the movie see something else or IMDB. The Blu-Ray in my opinion is as good as the Terminator is ever going to look. The picture is amazing, some of the CGI and other technology is outdated and it shows, but as far as transfers go, it's nice looking. Everything looks the way it should and the picture is as good as it gets.

Sound seems to be the issue a lot of people are having. I went into this with the understanding this was a low-budget film, they couldn't record in stereo and had to use a mono track and it's from the 80s. All of that considered, the sound is fine in my opinion. At times its low and you have to raise it up. But with all things considered, the sound is fine in my opinion. You're not going to get an amazing 5.1 sound from this movie if the original wasn't done with stereo sound. Just my two cents though.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Terminator, it's great for a cheap low-budget 80's movie.",1369094400,,1013,4.111111111111111

2134743,5,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron came up with ideas for this film while he was sick on the set of Piranha 2(1982). The Terminator(1984) was a big critical and commercial hit in 1984. It was a good movie that came out of nowhere. The Terminator echoes Westworld(1973), Somewhere in Time(1980), The Outer Limits and 1970's slasher movies. Skynet sends The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) from 2029 to 1984 to assassinate the mother of John Connor, the leader of the human resistance. John Connor sends his friend Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn) back to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton). The Terminator was well made with its limited $6 million budget. The animatronic T-800 designed by the late Stan Winston looks great. The music score by Brad Fiedel is good and sounds better in the sequel. The Terminator spawned rip offs including a Z grade remake directed by Ben Hernandez in 1991. This film turned ""I'll be back"" into a catchphrase. This film helped boost Schwarzenegger's career. I first saw this film on local TV in 1991. It was neat when the Terminator's flesh got cooked off and there was nothing left but a metal exoskeleton that chased Sarah and Kyle Reese into a factory! Arnold Schwarzenegger is superb as The Terminator. He's a cold, straight-faced killing machine. His Austrian accent has a robotic vibe. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen are good as police officers. Bess Motta is good as Sarah's friend Ginger. Motta was a cast member on the short lived TV show The New Monkees(1986). The Terminator(1984) is a classic, action packed, science fiction-horror film.",1369008000,,1580,5.057471264367816

I have a Sony BDP-S590 player which is current enough to have 3-D and Wi-Fi, but this Blu-ray ran super slow.  It doesn't help when extra menus (aka barriers) are inserted before I can play the movie.  Like a number of other Blu-rays, the player can't recall where I left off after the machine has been restarted.  Okay, I don't like that but, it's a common annoyance.  Also, many of the bonus features requires downloading to view which is again time consuming when the files are 500Mb.

Where I have a problem is with the transfer.  It is possible that the original negative was dull and murky and that this Blu-Ray is an exact replica of that.

2134777,5,B0002WYTWG,"I don't normally buy a BluRay to replace a BluRay of the same movie, but this time I made an exception. And, man am I happy I did.

This review is on the Remastered 2013 vs the original 2006 BluRay:

I never complained about the old version because it was so much better than the DVD and, being a 20yo, low budget movie, I didn't think it could get much better.  Well, it does. I just finished watching the Remastered version, followed by the old one; I can see major flaws after viewing the newer release. The 2006 copy is softer, flatter, has plenty of flecks of dirt throughout, and highlights tend to be blown out. All of this has finally been fixed.

The sound is pretty much the same, which is clear and active, but with some of the surround elements a bit louder than I think fits. I spent a lot of time turning up the sound when normal talking occurred, and turning it back down when the chase scenes or flashbacks happen as the switches make my wife jump. Neither movie has a mono track included. I don't mind, but some have complained.

Bonus features are exactly the same (and in SD), so don't expect anything new. The one change I didn't like was that now there's no main menu screen. The movie starts immediately and you have to use the pop-up menu to bring up choices (the older version went to a menu screen first). This is OK for the most part, but when playing features, it goes right back to the movie as soon as that bonus feature is done playing. It's not a deal breaker, but it does bother me.

Personal opinion: If you have an average TV & the old BluRay, this is probably not worth an upgrade, as you may not see much of a difference. If you have a high quality big screen, you might want to get it because you should see a big improvement in clarity. Both are better than the DVD, but the new one is head and shoulders above it. Don't upgrade for sound as the 2006 release sounds great & the 2013 isn't any different.

Hope this review helps.",1366675200,,1966,4.254691689008043

2134795,5,B0002WYTWG,"I can say with confidence that I dislike Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor.  His movies were once really exciting and adrenaline-rushing to watch as a youngster, but nowadays I find them overbearingly cheesy, atrocious from a storyline point of view and somewhat predictably written too.  However... there's always that one exception.  The Terminator *is* that one exception.  The original Terminator (and in fact the entire series) appeals to be in a way where most Arnold movies completely go over my head.  For one thing I suppose I like the entire time travel plotline.  This movie is about a terminator machine from several years into the future sent to destroy a woman by the name Sarah Connor.  However, the character of Michael Biehn is from the future as well and is clearly sent to save Sarah from her termination.  Michael sure has his work cut out for him as far as convincing Sarah he's actually the good guy!  This makes a compelling storyline.

The one unusual thing that has stood out to me over the years about this movie is that Arnold plays a bad guy.  Back in the day this was considered an enormous deal and a total surprise to everyone.  Not the same friendly guy we eventually saw in Kindergarten Cop, that's for sure.  Now some aspects of this movie probably haven't dated particularly well such as the segments showing the chaos from the machines going around zapping everything in sight.  It's obvious the machines aren't really there (thank you todays technology for spoiling us!!) and watching them move around is comparable to watching a movie within a movie.  However there's always something to make up for these dated portions (in this case, the one man getting zapped by the walking hunk of destruction and being destroyed before our very eyes, which was reminiscent of a pillow exploding into a pile of feathers- pretty awesome).

People don't understand why I love the Terminator so much since I have a history of knocking these type of films.  It has to due with my love of science fiction when executed a certain way.  It can't be *too* far-fetched (though truthfully this movie is borderline in that regard) and the story has to unravel in a way that's not confusing.  The Terminator succeeds on both counts.  A very easy to follow storyline without any confusion or question marks at the end- just the way I like it.

When it comes down to it, I simply love the feeling of fear when Arnold is marching down the street wielding a couple guns in his destructive search for Sarah Connor, destroying everything in his path.  This is a *wonderful* way to enable my heart to pump with unbelievable nonstop excitement.  I have to laugh however, whenever Arnold imitates the voices of people Sarah's familiar with over the phone.  Seems... really fruity, lol.  By the way, the most frightening part comes when Arnold's machine rises from the fire and walks down the street near the end.  It's freaky because of the way the film is presented during this part.  While unintentional back in 1984 when this movie was released (because the film was undoubtedly considered ahead of its time from a cinematic point of view) nowadays it's just really strange viewing material.  While it's clearly obvious the machine isn't *really* walking down the street, I like the freakiness associated with the machines movements.  It's almost comparable to experiencing an actual nightmare.  It's hard to explain.  It's just really freaking freaky!

Overall, a highly recommended film.  Does it hold up well?  YES!  Does it hold up over the years?  YES!  The action -especially Arnold's blaze through the police station- was just unbelievably fun.  A young girl running for her life presents a ton of suspense.  This is how a good action/science fiction should be in my opinion.",1365379200,,3790,4.853354134165366
2134796,5,B0002WYTWG,Great Movie which anybody with a bad ass stereo system needs to buy in order to play it for the opening scene of the robot crushing the skulls.  The sound is so perfect and encapsulates your audience if the system is properly tuned.,1365292800,,232,4.395348837209302
2134797,3,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day has aged fairly well in the decades since its release.  The CGI may not be as mind-blowing as it was back then, but it still served to tell an exciting, if inelegant, tale about taking your future into your own hands.  As with The Abyss, the director's cut of this movie restores crucial nuggets of information. Knowing, for example, that the Connors decided to reprogram the T-800 to allow it to learn and process information with a more human understanding make one less likely to say ""Groan!"" when the Terminator gets all gushy and sentimental toward the end.

So, the movie is good.  Let's talk about streaming on Amazon Prime and Amazon Instant Video.

About a year ago I subscribed to Amazon Prime, in part for access to its large library of movies in both HD and SD.  When I saw that T2 was being offered in HD, I was excited for the opportunity to watch it that way.  but I noticed with this movie, and most others, that streaming in HD is a near impossibility. They say HD is available, but even with a speedy connection, it never is. I am able to stream content over Netflix and Hulu in high definition on a regular basis.  I purchased Cabin in the Woods on Amazon Instant, hoping to watch it in HD, and have been disappointed that I am only able to watch it in SD ever since.

2134798,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is a great version of the movie.  Everything looks great, except the scenes they needed chromakey (green/blue screen) for because they couldn't make that as clean as everything else.  However, some of the sound is a little silly.  Mainly, I think I'm hearing newly inserted digital effects that are crisp and clear over the old analog music and voice and the sound quality just doesn't match.  Gun shots and their echoing booms sound different from the rest of the movie.  The gun shots from Arnold's laser-sighted hand gun also have been completely changed and sound cheesy for what it is...like something out of Star Wars that isn't necessarily even a weapon.  Even the future scenes have weapons that sound more like something out of Star Wars or even Tron.",1365206400,,765,4.846153846153846

2134811,4,B0002WYTWG,"Let me get this part out of the way: I AM the biggest Terminator fan that I know. I've watched this film countless times since I was child. I know it like the back of my hand.

The video quality is wonderful. The best presentation I've seen of the film, and I've owned it on literally every format. Crisp, clear, with just enough of the grain still present.

Sound- This can either make or break it for some. I was disappointed at the first release of this film on Blu since it only included the ""remastered audio"". For those unfamiliar, what they did was give the movie a surround mix (which is great), but inserted different sound effects for a couple of the gunshots and a few, other small things. Now, to most people, this may not be an issue. But to people like me who grew up with this film, it's just weird and threw me off. Unfortunately, this version only comes with that sound mix. No original soundtrack present :(

Extras- Meh. Same as the special edition, which weren't that great to begin with. This film deserves much more.

Anyways, this is the best way (in my opinion) to watch this flick. Just don't throw away your special edition DVD version so that you can have the option to watch with the original mono soundtrack :)",1364428800,,1239,4.421052631578948

The previous blu-ray release was not good at all.  This one is significantly improved.  While there is still some film grain, especially in low-light shots, it is not distracting.  The level of detail is significantly sharpened.  One downside of the improved clarity, however, is that certain closeups of Arnold Schwarzenegger's face now reveal the makeup and special effects.

I'm planning on making a life size statue of the T-800 myself  but lacked the materials needed to sculpt my own skull. the rest I can make but this will help allot. I did end up modifying it after i received it. I took the extra black paint off of the temporal gears. The details are there they just went overboard with the black paint. I also didn't like the look of the red eyes they seemed to simple so I went and snagged some red lamps from Radio Shack and put them in because they are more screen accurate. Next I plan on repainting the teeth. I got it knowing I would be changing some things but even without my changes its an awesome bust. The movies also make a great add on to my collection. Now if amazon would just carry the T-600 bust with blue rays of the terminator salvation movie I can only find that on ebay and well...I don't like ebay.,1363046400,,970,4.159574468085107
2134841,5,B0002WYTWG,"First of all, casual viewers are going to just have to ignore the negs here. That is about all you can do. This is the highest video quality you are going to see on bluray. A 36Mbps transfer of an older grainy film and damn does it look wonderful. The AWFUL red push of the old releases is gone and THANK THE HEAVENS. This film looks unbelievable and I am NOT easy to please when it comes to details and bitrates. Most blurays these days cannot seem to get past 25Mbps, many are much less, and it shows with fluctuating quality throughout the film. Not this one.

They slightly changed the color timing to reflect a modern and SLIGHTLY cooler tone. Some people cannot seem to deal with the fact we are no longer in the 80s and no director worth their salt wants that pinkish/reddish look, that was quite common in that time, to their films now that they have a choice. Blade Runner did the same and The Final Cut looks better than it ever did, though, that release has less than HALF the bitrate of this release. Anyway, the timing does wonders for this film IMO. I have never seen this so detailed in all my life. I really think the new timing gives it a more timeless look and will be appreciated by most people. In no way will it hardly even be noticed for the vast majority. Skintones remain natural and whites are still nice and bright.

As for the sound, it is also the most balanced and proper it has sounded in a long time. There are these few diehard weirdos who cannot seem to deal with the fact that most people don't like mono and don't want to listen to mono in film when there are effects taking place all over the soundstage that take advantage of more than one speaker. Cameron never meant for there to be a Mono track it is just that the producers would not let him have his 4 track stereo because they were cheap bastards. He even came in under budget ffs. Mono also has many other deficiencies compared to stereo with depth of the various instruments and sounds and the overall balance of the mix. You can read about that somewhere else.

I do agree they should have at least included it but quite honestly I would not be using it anyway. They seem to have improved the stereo and multi-channel tracks. To my ears the gun sounds are fine and sound pretty damn good for an 80s film. They redid some of the effects with T2 ones to my knowledge a while back. This presentation seems more balanced than any other releases to my ears.

For the people that are boycotting this release let them. This isn't some travesty like the original Patton release or the Predator: Ultimate Edition release which were DNR'd to within an inch of their life and looked like wax on screen. To the contrary, this is one of the best looking blurays on the market. The old Terminator release is a joke compared to this.

Nothing to be afraid of with this one. They did just about everything right except include the old mono track. And no one but a few really care because it ain't that great to begin with. 5 stars for a great remaster and at 10 bucks at Walmart, and around that on Amazon, you really cannot go wrong. Extras are the same as the past versions to my knowledge. Peace.",1362960000,,3179,4.336134453781512

You're not going to find much to appreciate about this film on an intellectual level. Sure the running theme of ""No fate but what we make"" raises it slightly above the average action film, at it's core, this movie is just big dumb science fiction action, of an ilk they don't really make anymore.

The T-1000, a brawny emotionless cyborg from the future, is the role that Arnold was born to play, and he reprises it perfectly while adding some subtle additions to the character. Sadly this was the peak of his career before entering his role as the governor of California and is now probably too old to be a major player in the action genre. Linda Hamilton is also amazing here. No longer the meek victim of the first movie, her character Sarah Connor has clearly been driven nearly insane by the revelations of the last movie and a desperate need to prepare her son for his future role as humanity's savior.",1362441600,,1044,4.4375

2134852,4,B0002WYTWG,"The soundtrack of Terminator broke ground for the genre, with its creepy, haunting and ominous techno kind of feel. In all the Terminator movies, the sound track is pretty much the star. T2 adds deeper character to the series. Even the bad Terminator has interesting depth and responses to the role.

Was the original Terminator a lot scarier? Oh yeah. But the liquid metal Terminator felt like he fit right into the L.A. Police Department. Not sure if that was intended to be a comment on the department but in retrospect that's a lot of what the police can be. Scary and everywhere. No point in shooting back, just try to stay away.

Meanwhile the T1000 played by Schwarzenegger enjoys the chance to embrace some of the nicer bits of California, the desert, John as a child, nice bikes. Stunts were great and the comedy was better.

2134858,4,B0002WYTWG,"The 1984 sci-fi/action classic ""The Terminator"" is one of the greatest and most influential films of all time. It's one of my top ten favorite films ever made and seems to only get better with age. So with that being said, the main purpose of my review is to talk about the new remastered blu-ray that was released on February 19th, 2013 and how it compares to the original blu-ray release from 2006.

To be quick and to the point, this new blu-ray release blows the old disc out of the water. (This appears to be the same transfer that has been out for a little wile in Europe). Detail is greatly improved in addition to far superior contrast and black levels which is very important due to how much of the movie takes place at night. It was apparent with the 2006 blu-ray that the old ancient HD master used for the special edition DVD was dumped onto blu-ray which is what a ton of companies were doing at the beginning of the blu-ray era. There is a nice layer of film grain present that gives everything a nice feel with no evidence of digital noise reduction being applied. The old blu-ray barely looked better than an upconverted DVD and this new blu-ray FINALLY presents the film in the best quality that it's ever been for the home market. It's also on a dual layer disc this time with a very high bit rate in the mid to upper 30's throughout.

There has been some grumbling on the internet of some fans questioning the transfer's more teal/bluish color scheme in comparison to past releases. Anybody who is fan of writer & director James Cameron knows that he really likes bathing his nighttime scenes in blue hues. I did a direct comparison with the old blu-ray and the new one appears much more natural in terms of skin tones and the overall color textures. The picture quality on then new blu-ray is just so beautiful and a massive improvement over the old disc, I really don't see how anybody who loves the film as much as I do would have any complaints.

On the audio side, we get a lossless DTS surround mix that originally appeared on the old special edition DVD. This particular mix has been a point of contention with a lot of fans over the years. This is due to that the original audio for the film was in mono and for the surround remix, certain sound effects like gunshots were replaced. The old DVD featured both the original mono track and the 5.1 remix. The first blu-ray onl contained the surround remix. For this new blu-ray, I've always felt that the original audio track should be presented if a remix was done. With that being said, I don't mind the new gun shot sounds in the surround remix but would like to have had the mono track in lossless audio too.

Extras are the same as the first blu-ray in which we get a 13 minute featurette on the visual effects & music, a fun 20 minute sit down conversation with James Cameron & Arnold Schwarzenegger reminiscing about the film and some deleted scenes. Still missing in action from the special edition DVD are the optional James Cameron commentary on the deleted scenes explaining why they were cut out as welll as the remained of the hour long making of doumentary that the visual effects piece was pulled from. Since this new blu-ray is on a dual layered 50 gigabyte disc, it's not an issue of space since those extras are all in standard definition to begin with. No trailers for the film are present either which is disappointing from a completist point of view.

So, sadly we still have yet to get the true definitive blu-ray of The Terminator with those mentioned extras not being included along with the original mono audio track. But all fans owe it to themselves to get this new blu-ray due to the massive upgrade in picture quality. Do like I did hold onto your old special edition flipper DVD to have all of the extras and make your own 2 disc set. The movie looks gorgeous now compared to the old ancient blu-ray and this appears to be the best that we're going to get!",1361923200,,3960,4.449035812672176

We have the silver nemesis T-1000. Add to the mix young ""this is my town"" John Conner, and we have a perfect blended cast of characters. The action isn't bad either.

No plot spoilers from me: The movie picks up some time in future where John Connor (Edward Furlong) is now a very rude and annoying teenager, Sara Connor (Linda Hamilton, who got in amazing shape for this movie) is committed in a maximum security mental institution, and a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger, brawny as ever) is sent back in time along with a very cool updated T-1000 Terminator (well played by Robert Patrick). The acting, action, and special effects are top notch, but the movie is somewhat hampered by weak dialog between John and The Terminator, but honestly it isn't that distracting and dialog really is not why we watch these movies.

This is a strong addition to The Terminator franchise.

My question is, who is going to buy this reissue?  I personally could not see any difference between the older blu ray release and the DVD SE edition.  The remastered version on sale in Europe has many Terminator purists complaining; one problem is the color register - people say it has a 'teal' tint; another is the lack of the original (mono) soundtrack.

I am hoping at the very least they will do something about the soundtrack options, I listen to the movie with the mono soundtrack as the surround audio sounds fake to me.

I guess people will buy this, watch it, think 'that was ok' and put it on the shelf to be forgotten until the next format comes along.  It's never going to be a blu ray to show off your home theater system.",1358899200,,945,4.433526011560693

I remember being blown away when the T-1000 came out of the wreckage of the semi truck for the first time and thought ""wow!""  These days it's pretty tame.  The acting by both the terminators was mediocre at best, but the best acting was by Linda Hamilton.  She transformed herself into one kick butt lady!  Especially when one juxtaposes the first with the second.  I am loath to give it 5 stars, because it really is not that good.

I give it 3 stars mostly because of what it did for its time.  It was one of the first blockbuster films to use computer graphics in the capacity that it did.  There were others before it, like Tron, but that was just cheesy eye candy, this had a lot more depth and gave the terminator a personality, albeit a minor one, that played off John's character well.  It is a shame that Edward Furlong (John) turned into a complete loser later in life as he had some potential, but like most kids in films, he got into drugs and alcohol and that ended that.

I don't blame Linda Hamilton for not reprising her role in the third, as the reviews were bad and I couldn't bring myself to watch the movie after learning that Hamilton wouldn't do it.  That spoke volumes.

T2 was a good action film for its day, but it will probably be another 21-22 years before I watch it again.",1358553600,,1473,4.270758122743683

2134957,4,B0002WYTWG,"I knew that ""The Terminator"" would be re-issued, and with a better remastering effort. I knew this because the last known re-issue of ""The Terminator"" on DVD had many extras. Like additional documentaries and the making of the film, etc.... The first issued Blu-Ray of the film actually looked no better than the first issued DVD (it appears to be the same unimproved source copy) but however, it also excluded all that extra material that the last known DVD version had so you will be more anxious to buy the film again, later, that will include all those already existing extras.

I believe this was their plan to double dip the consumer to resell this movie again, on Blu-Ray.

You gotta ask yourself. ""How many times have I bought this same movie over the years, with the promise of it being somewhat more improved?"" (your purchases of the past included VHS in several re-issues, Beta, Laserdisc, DVD again in several re-issues, BD, etc.) The Blu-Ray has been issued twice already, and now, here comes the third re-issue on Blu-Ray.

It's ridiculous how they do this to us. They give as little as they can on the first release, and then they improve on it just a little more, with a hope to re-sell it again. And then again.

You watch, three to five years from now, you will probably be buying ""The Terminator"" yet again, because they will again do something more for it to make your current copy inferior to it. They will always add a little something more to a re-issue to make you want to buy it again.

It's also interesting to note that if you ask around a lot of Terminator fans, most will tell you that Terminator 2:  Judgment Day is their favorite movie.  If you would have asked me this question about 10-15 years ago, I would have concurred with the consensus on this.  However, after some deeper thought about the two movies, I now consider the first Terminator my favorite because compared to the sequel, the first Terminator movie has a much stronger sense of tension and urgency.

STORY

In the relatively distant future (2029), a nuclear war has wiped out most of humanity.  However, armies of anthropomorphic machines and cyborgs are dead-set on eliminating the survivors.  The genocidal machines send a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to Los Angeles circa 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of human resistance leader, John Connor.  The human resistance sends a resistance fighter named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to infiltrate the Terminator and save Sarah.

CHARACTERS

What makes this movie such a great one is the characters.  Sarah steals the show since she's very easy to relate to, since she feels like a real person.  When she's faced with impending death by the Terminator, she understandably acts scared as hell and when she meets Kyle Reese, she initially thinks he's a maniac, even when he saves her from the Terminator at the Tech Noir club.  Kyle is great as the ""hero"" of the movie because much like what John McClane would help establish in the mighty Die Hard several years after this movie, he's not unstoppable and is faced with grave danger that forces him to act creatively.  He knows that the Terminator is much stronger than him, and in the beginning, is even doubtful that he can destroy it since he's restricted from the high-tech weapons he had in the future, and is forced to fight with sawed off shotguns and homemade pipe bombs.

Arnie did a great job as the Terminator.  The Terminator lives up to his name, and is one terrifying entity that could easily make him among the best antagonists in film in the last thirty years.  He has no emotion, can't feel pain, and is virtually unstoppable.  It's also really menacing to see him murder people, especially unarmed women.

STORYTELLING

One of the things that really helps out this movie is how James Cameron has the story told.  Through some scenes of exposition, such as when Kyle has to explain to Sarah what cyborgs are and what his life in the future was like, they didn't feel like the ""designated spots"" where exposition is done.  Especially with Kyle explaining to Sarah what cyborgs are, he does so in a really cautious and quiet manner, since he knows that the Terminator is looking for him.

The logic behind time travel is not only established well, but like any good movie, the story and characters actually follow through that logic.  An example would be with time travel.  Only organic masses can travel through time, thus why the Terminator and Kyle arrive naked when they come into LA circa 1984, and when Kyle explains to a police psychiatrist why he couldn't bring back any advanced weaponry back to the past.

ACTION SCENES

With this movie being a sci-fi action/thriller entry, the action movies are top-notch.

Since the characters are developed well, these make the action scenes that much more tense.  Among the best scenes in this has to be when the Terminator enters the Tech Noir club and finds Sarah Connor.  You see Kyle emerge and fire many shotgun shells into the cyborg and it doesn't stop him.  Also, this scene helps establish how much of a cold, ugly entity the Terminator is when he ends up gunning down a few people at the club during the firefight.

Let's not forget the iconic scene where the Terminator assaults the police station Kyle and Sarah are kept in.  This scene marks how terrifying the Terminator is since not even over two dozen armed police officers could stop him, and shows how creative Kyle is when he's faced with danger and isn't in a position to fight.

The action scenes also show Sarah and Kyle as vulnerable characters, which make you root for them even harder as the movie runs.  Kyle gets shot a few times and towards the end, gets worn down from all the combat to where Sarah has to push him into ""snapping back into it.""

The chase scene near the end also enhances the Terminator's characteristic of being unstoppable and of Kyle's creativity, since the Terminator survives a head-on collision with an 18-wheel tanker truck and Kyle has to see if one pipe bomb can stop a cyborg driving a tanker truck.

CINEMATOGRAPHY

Adam Greenberg's cinematography for this was perfect.  The shots of at the time current day Los Angeles look gritty and claustrophobic, helping to enhance the feeling of dread and tension in this movie.  I thought it was perfect to have the final fight take place in a factory loaded with robotic assembly machines, helping to further the feeling of industrialized, metallic terror.

SPECIAL EFFECTS

While some special effects have shown their age (such as the walking Terminator skeleton near the end and of the Terminator's face when one of his eyes are damaged), other effects still look good today.  I though one of the best-looking effects in that movie is when the Terminator does some self-surgery on his arm after getting in gun battles with Kyle, and you see the inner workings of his cyborg arm.  This was simultaneously gross and impressive to look at.  Even with the effects that could have aged better, the special effects overall help the movie greatly than harm it.

SOUNDTRACK

Brad Fiedel's soundtrack for this movie is one of the best I've ever heard in cinema, whether it be live-action or animated.  Some may complain that the music is ""dated,"" but I think it matches the tone and style of the movie perfectly.  Most of the music on here is made from keyboard synthesizers, and all of it is instrumental.  The soundtrack perfectly shows that a genius with minimal resources can make something brilliant.  The mechanized, metallic beats and dread-laden synth-layers are superb, especially in the scenes where Kyle has a flashback to when he fought giant war machines and automated gunships and during the end fight in the factory.

MATURE CONTENT

This is not a movie for the kids, since there's quite a few scenes in the beginning with male nudity, some scenes of nasty gore, and a tastefully-done sex scene between Kyle and Sarah.

FINAL WORD

The Terminator is easily among James Cameron's brightest jewels in his filmography.  If you don't have this movie in your collection yet, get it now.",1355875200,,6876,4.788624787775891

The new transfer looks great. It's sharp and grain is intact. However, it should be noted that the color-timing is not what you'd be used to for this film. It takes a tealish look, especially in certain scenes. The look works for the film, but it's certainly not what we have seen over the years on TV, VHS, DVD, screenshots, etc. It's a whole-new look for the film. Whether or not it was the intended look from the start, or whether James Cameron had a hand in making it look this way has yet to be seen. But over-all it is a superior transfer, and it makes owning this disc worth it.

Sound:
Fairly active and robust surround sound here, but sadly it is the remix sound. The original mono with the original sound effects is missing once again, so expect a few moments of ""Wow, the sound effects there were horrid.""

Extras:
A couple of featurettes, nothing terribly formidable. Also, the deleted scenes in SD. All of the extras here can be found on the Special Edition DVD, and missing is the hour-long 'Other Voices' documentary and extensive Easter eggs also found on that release.

Truly a classic movie....",1353628800,,357,4.634920634920635
2134994,4,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2(released July/91)stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the terminator,Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor,Robert Patrick as the T-1000 terminator,and others. Ah-nold spawned yet another iconic movie phrase when he came out with ""Hasta la vista, baby"",but I forgot that it wasn't his character that first came out with it,it was the young John Connor that told him to say it. It is rare that the first movie in a franchise is equaled or beaten,but Cameron went on to top his first work in the franchise with this one. It features another heart pounding almost continual pursuit of Ah-nold and those in his care.
The story finds two terminators this time around,""beaming"" back in time,surrounded by the usual electromagnetic arcs. One is Schwarzenegger,and the other is Patrick. Patrick is a new and improved T-1000 model,whose structure is liquid metal. He can morph into just about any form he wishes. Patrick is the bad terminator,as his mission is to kill the young John Connor. Ah-nold is the terminator sent back to protect John,and we learn this turn about,about the same time the characters do.
Sarah's son John has been in and out of foster homes for quite some time,while Sarah is locked away in a mental institution. Ah-nold reaches young John in a video arcade,just as Patrick is about to do his duty. They escape and young John has to order Ah-nold to go rescue his mother. Ah-nold warns that Patrick will be there also,but that doesn't deter young John. When they get to the institution Sarah is in the midst of breaking out herself. She is terrified when Ah-nold shows up and her son has to reassure her that he is on their side. They all barely escape with Patrick,once more,in hot pursuit.
The trio flee to Mexico and regroup there at an old friend of Sarah's. They get weapons,ammo and some much needed rest. They then decide that it is the creator of the advanced micro chip,Dyson of Cyberdine Industries,that must be stopped. Dyson has reverse engineered his chip from what was left of Ah-nolds body from the first film. Sarah goes off ahead of John and Ah-nold and tries to assassinate Dyson in his home. She even gets so far as to invade his home and hold him at gunpoint. But with his wife and child there she cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. Ah-nold and John catch up with her and they sit Dyson down to explain the consequences for the future of his work. Dyson gets the trio into Cyberdine and they set about to destroy all remnants of his work so far. The police of course arrive and while Sarah,John and Ah-nold high tail it out,a wounded Dyson sits next to a detonator which he eventually sets off.
Patrick,in hot pursuit of the trio, end up inside a steel mill,where the final showdown occurs. As Patrick walks through torrents of liquid nitrogen from an over turned truck,it starts short circuiting his ability to shape shift. Once inside he eventually corners Sarah and John. Sarah empties her shotgun into Patrick,but runs out before she can execute the coup de gras.
Ah-nold appears just in time to save the day sending Patrick into a tank of molten steel,in which he disintegrates. Ah-nold is the last remnant of future technology left,and he asks Sarah to lower him into the tank so he can be destroyed. The film ends as Sarah ruminates on a better future for mankind.
Filled with then,state of the art CGI and morphing techniques,Terminator 2 still stands out as an excellent film today. Cameron does a nice job at the start of fooling us all into thinking Ah-nold is the bad guy once again. The film flows nicely and again there are few moments to rest in this film. The only moments of such that come to mind are their trek to Mexico,where they regroup before the movies finale. Other than that it is go,go,go. Patrick's character brings the threat level a notch higher than even the first movie. His model of terminator is that much better than Ah-nolds and his liquid metal composition makes for an almost indestructible opponent. The Sarah character has become that much stronger emotionally and physically,as she has prepared both herself and her son for the inevitable battle ahead.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and in this extreme edition,is clear and crisp. This two disc single sided collection has disc one offering up the 152 minute extreme version and it's a great version at that. The outer dust jacket that can be slid off,tells you that these DVDs contain""multiple""versions;as in more than just two,but two are all you get. And to get the original theatrical version,which is on disc two,you have to play it in your computer and have a system with Win/XP and lower to run it,with an internet connection. Extras on the first disc have commentary and the film is THX optimized. The second disc has,along with the other film version,a couple of featurettes and some other computer spawned specials.
All in all Cameron actually topped the first Terminator with this one. The S/FX were far and away that much better. The story just keeps rolling along as the trio of Ah-nold,Sarah and young John try to outrun the seemingly indestructible Patrick;who just never stops coming. 4- 4 1/2 stars.",1353369600,,5176,4.777901785714286
2134995,4,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator(released Oct/84)was Schwarzenegger's cementing of his acting career to the highest heights of the action genre. It was a fast paced,thrill ride and he played his part of a cyborg killing machine,right down the middle. Starring along with him was Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor,Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese,Paul Winfield as Ed Traxler,Lance Henriksen as Hal Vukovich,and others. Henriksen would go onto star in director Cameron's Alien 2,along with Cameron`s friend Bill Paxton,who can be seen as the punk with the spiked hair outside the Griffith Observatory near the beginning.
The world of the future on 2029 Earth has machines battling humans. A defense system created by Cyberdine systems for the U.S.Government,became more powerful than anyone could have imagined. The system eventually turned on humans in general,and thus began mankind`s battle back to reclaim the earth from machines. When all seemed lost for the humans,one John Connor inspired the people to never give up and the resistance spread far and wide,and much stronger than before. The machines decided in order to completely wipe out the resistance movement,they would send one of their own back in time to kill John's mother,Sarah. And so they sent a cyborg(Schwarzenegger),who suddenly appears naked on the street,amidst bolts of static electricity. The resistance learns of their plans and sends one of their own back to protect her,Kyle Reese(Biehn).
In 1984 Sarah is not married and lives with a roommate. Suddenly other Sarah Connors in the L.A. area start getting killed one by one. When she is the only one left she gets worried and calls the police for protection. However the cyborg sent to kill her is hot on her trail and is now stalking her in the very club she awaits for a police escort in. Just as he is about to shoot,Reese is there also and he blasts away at the cyborg. Very little can stop the machine and it continues to recover after every blast of Reese`s weapon. Sarah and Reese flee for their lives,while the cyborg is never very far behind.
In a motel the two talk of Reese`s future,Sarah`s future son John and what has happened to bring him back. He admits that he loves Sarah and the two make love,with Reese unintentionally becoming the father of his good friend John from the future. Their bonding is short lived as the cyborg eventually catches up and the two must flee once more. Out on the highway a chase ends in Reese`s death and the cyborg is totally burned. However,even though the outer covering has burned away the inner mechanism still functions and continues to pursue Sarah. She hides in a factory and when the chance arises,she manages to crush the cyborg under a heavy duty press.
The film ends as a pregnant Sarah has gone to Mexico,and as she gets gas a kid takes a picture of her. It happens to be the same picture Reese was carrying of her when he first arrived in the past;the one given to him by John.
Well written and directed by Cameron,this film not only cemented Schwarzenegger`s career but also gave Cameron`s a much needed kick in the pants also. There are little moments of rest in this film,because its`very theme of being constantly pursued,negates it. That is what makes it purr along so well. Schwarzenegger does a great job in his role,and if you didn`t already know,this is the film from which his famous line,that everyone to this day still copies,comes from:``I`ll be back``.And as fate and the box office receipts would have it,Ah-nold WOULD be back for two more Terminators. It is unfortunate that the opening prologue mentions that the events portrayed are happening now,in 1984. This dates the film. It is too bad no one had the foresight to just say events transpire in 1984 or that this is simply present day. As an aside,Sarah`s roommate was Bess Mota,the star of the famous work out show of the 80s,The 20 minute Workout.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and for its age it looks darn good. Extras on this one disc edition include the trailer and some old DVD ROM features.
All in all,this is the action movie that put Schwarzenegger on top and catapulted Cameron`s career along. The film moves along from beginning to end and has alot of heart stopping and thrilling moments throughout. 4 solid stars. Recommended.",1353196800,,4303,4.8478260869565215
2134996,2,B0002WYTWG,"If you are really into all the special edition features and all the bells and whistles, this might be a great disk for you. However, if all you want to do is watch the movie, forget it! I am not even going to go into the special features since they are well covered in other reviews. So if you just want to watch the movie, you have to cancel the attempt to log into ""Skynet"", then it tells you that if you want to get the full  Blu-Ray features you NEED the internet connection, and you have to wait a bit there. After a few graphics, you get to pick a version, theatrical or special. Ok, you have picked your version, and now you can watch your movie right? Well sure, after all the promo screens for Lionsgate, a special T2 THX bit, and several others eating up time that you can't skip. So now you can watch the movie. Ok, it's not the first disk with all that stuff, but it takes longer than any I have come across before, and be careful not to stop it, (or in my case bump my remote) because you can't get to the menu to choose scene select until you have gone through every second of that stuff, AND when you do get to the scene select, you only get to look at one choice at a time, not a page with four or six scenes per page. I know to some people this will sound really picky, but what I am getting at it that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to just put in the disk and watch it.

2135010,3,B0002WYTWG,"Watching T2 in 2012, you have to remember that this movie was one of the first big blockbuster sci-fi action flicks.  Special effects have come a long way, but in its day, T2 had CGI years ahead of its time.  So far ahead that this movie leans into that fact and skimps a bit on story.  The evolution of Sarah Connor from bungling waitress to pit bull is the interesting core of the story, and the warning to not become what you hate is powerfully delivered.

Unfortunately, Arnie's career goals (young John tells the Terminator not to kill anyone) water down the believability of his Terminator character, and the horrid performance by the child star who plays John Connor are painful to behold.  Still, there's enough there to make it interesting with the regular length version, with lots of explosions, gunfire and liquid metal morphing.

This time it loaded but trying to get through the menu just to get to the movie was a long process, almost 5 minutes which is too long to have to navigate through a menu.  Badly designed if you ask me. Once i got to the movie i was not happy with the sound.  It was just plying in stereo and i have a pretty good surround sound system.  I went and checked the set up menu for audio and everything was correct for surround and i double checked my  receiver settings and they were correct  but still only sound through the front left and right channel.  I returned it the next day.  Maybe that is why it was only $5.  You really get what you pay for.

According to this amazon page, this 2-disc set has the Theatrical release and the Special Edition Version of T2, both in widescreen.  The 2-DVD set I received had only the Special Edition Version on DVD. The 2nd disc has the Theatrical Release, but it is NOT a DVD. It is to watch on your computer using some fancy application that I don't have. So it didn't work on my computer. I returned the DVD because I thought they sent me the wrong one.

[Please note the version of Terminator 2 that I linked above. Amazon has a bad habit of putting a review for one edition/version of a movie on every page of every version/edition. It can be difficult to figure out which version someone is reviewing!]

After I sent back the wrong version of the movie, I ordered it a second time, again from this page (as linked above). The second time I received the SAME thing. So WARNING! You cannot watch the Theatrical release on DVD. And the EXTRAS shown on this amazon page are different from the extras actually contained on the 2-disc set they'll send you.

That said, I decided to keep the second set, even though I tried to contact the seller, through amazon's contact seller feature, twice to ask what's going on, and they never bothered to reply. Beware of Mighty Silver! There is no customer service there, and they don't care if you got the wrong item. Incidentally, amazon doesn't care, either. They'll give you your money back, but they're not changing the page.

Now that my rant is over, I'll review the 2-disc set I received - twice.

The first DVD disc has the Special Edition Version of the movie. Your viewing choices are to watch in Dolby 5.1 SurroundSound, Dolby Headphones. You can also watch it with a fantastic Commentary Track, and with either English or Spanish Subtitles.

The differences between the Special Edition and the Theatrical Release are that several deleted scenes are added back in. To tell the truth, I like the Theatrical Version better, but maybe that's just because it's a beloved movie in our house.
Added scenes that I noticed:
1. The T-1000 leaves the scene of the wreckage of the giant tow-truck he used to chase after T (Arnold's Terminator) and John on the motorcycle. New: Firemen are cleaning up the wreckage.
2.  In the psychiatric hospital, Sarah is sitting on her bed in her cell. New: Sarah has a dream sequence with Reece seemingly visiting her. (According to the Commentary Track, the idea was to tell some past story from the 1st movie. I think it's open to interpretation whether she had a vision or a dream.)
3. In the psychiatric hospital, the doctor has just stopped at Sarah's cell, where she's doing pullups, and he's talking about her with his guests. New: Two guards enter Sarah's room and use truncheons and tazers on her to get her to take her pills. It's a brutal scene.
4. T and John have called the foster parents' house, and realize they must be dead. Cut to the T-1000, changing back to a policeman from the shape of the foster-mother (skewering the foster father). New: T-1000 goes into the back yard and kills the dog. He takes it's collar, and sees the name ""Max"". He realizes T and John tricked him.
5. They have pulled the police car into a closed service station, where T and Sarah sew each other up. New: John asks T if he can learn. T says that he can if they pull a switch in his microprocessor. Sarah opens his head and takes out the chip and is going to destroy it. John stops her. (According to the Commentary, this was deleted for timing reasons, but both Cameron and Wisher really miss it. They love how it shows Sarah's mistrust and confliction with T.)
6. T busts the window of an old station wagon to steal it, then they are on the side of a road and Sarah is eating a sandwich in the station wagon. New: In between these two scenes, John takes T to get food at a food trailer and tries to teach him how to smile.
7. Traveling South in the station wagon, Sarah asks T about Dyson, and T replies that he has extensive files on him. New: Scene changes to Dyson working at his computers at his gorgeous seaside home. His wife wants him to stop for some family time, but he is too excited, working on a revolutionary microprocessor.
8. They stop at Enrique's in the desert to weapon up. New: Sarah tells Enrique they should leave tonight, too, and he responds angrily. In the underground weapons locker that John and T opened, there's a longer conversation between the two.
9. In the final scene at the iron works, the T-1000 has just reconstituted himself after the liquid nitrogen freezing. New: As he passes a striped steel barrier to enter the building, he puts his hand on the barrier and his hand and arm turn striped and stick to the bar. (Per the Commentary, this had been the first thing to show that he had been ""injured"" and wasn't working quite right.)

COMMENTARY TRACK:  I thought this was one of the best commentary tracks I've ever listened to, and I've listened to a lot! It was recorded on 2/10/2003 with commenters James Cameron, director and co-writer, and William Wisher, co-writer. This was the first time Cameron had recorded a commentary track for one of his films. They cover everything, from special effects to acting to subtext. Two of my favorite comments:

At the very beginning, when the T-1000 comes through from the future and is kneeling naked, Cameron comments: ""We did digital winky removal here. Apparently it was not complete ... I remember seeing a bill for digital willy removal. I want that money back!""

When someone asks, who is your favorite kick-a$^% female character, my answer is always Linda Hamilton in T2. She is not comic-book and special effects, she is the real thing. In the commentary, Cameron says that Linda didn't just work out, she did weapons training. And, ""Linda could really run. Like a panther.""

Also, at the beginning, Cameron mentions how when he first approached Arnold Schwarzenegger about T2, Arnold wasn't enthusiatic. He ""wasn't at all sure"" that it was going to work for him to play the good guy.

DISC 2:
1. ""No Feat But What We Make"". This is a 24 minute short on Terminator 2's ""role in the rise of digital special effects"". Comments by James Cameron (T2 writer-director and director of ""The Abyss""), Dennis Muren (ILM visual effects supervisor), John Knoll (ILM CG supervisor for ""The Abyss"" and Co-Creator of Adobe Photoshop), Steve Spaz Williams (ILM animation), Mark A.Z. Dippe' (ILM CG Supervisor), Stan Winston (Special Makeup and Terminator effects), Peter Jackson (director ""The Lord of the Rings""). Cameron and Knoll talk about how the water alien psuedopod, in ""Abyss"", was a leap of trust in CGI, because nothing like that had ever been done in film. Then, in T2, what Cameron had was a $100 million dollar film dependent on CG, when it had been done only once before in a film and then for only one 9-minute sequence.
2. ""T2: On the Set"", an 8 minute production shot montage. Interesting stuff, like the model shots of the tank truck, carrying liquid nitrogen, sliding down the street.
3. ""High Definition - Theatrical Version ROM"". ""This disc contains the complete theatrical version of the film in Microsoft Windows Media 9 series, payable in high definition and 5.1 sound exclusively on your PC. The resolution is higher than standard DVD format.""  Didn't work on my computer.
4. DVD ROM. ""Play this DVD in your computer to access the T2FX Studio and other ROM features powered by Interactual Software."" Didn't work on my computer.

ZERO stars for an amazon page that gives false information.
ZERO stars for Mighty Silver, incapable of fulfilling your order from the amazon page.
FIVE stars for the theatrical release, now if I could just get a DVD of it.
FOUR POINT FOUR stars, rounded down to FOUR, for the Special Edition Version of T2 - it's not as tightly constructed as the theatrical release.

ADDED LATER:
I did get a single-disc DVD of the theatrical release. I don't think I can give you a link to the amazon page, because it is not fulfilled by amazon. Rather you order from individual sellers and pay shipping. However, I got it for $2.99 plus shipping!

Unfortunately, I can't review that DVD and it's extras, because amazon put my review of the 2-disc extended version on the page of the single disc theatrical release. I wish they would stop doing that.

This movie is the reason I stepped up to Blu-ray.  The picture is so clean it's like staring through a window, the sound is cleaned up so well, it's like listening to Arnold talk (Put dat cookie down Now!) in real life.  But the one real problem I had is the disc's loading time.  Absurd, unreal, WHY does it have to check for updates?!!!  I do not put in movies just so it can waste my time searching for firmware updates.  My whole reason for why I became a movie buff is because I no longer have the patience for slow moving updates or bad internet connectivity.  I found out (get this) that this blu-ray disc was incompatible with the cheap blu-ray player I bought from Walmart.  I had to order a not so commonly known electronics brand from Canada called Seiki which I discovered can load up blu-rays, and dvds faster than you can fast forward a vhs to the opening scene of a film.  It was expensive, but I love it.  I can also watch uber rare foreign films that have different region coding.  It also bypasses blu-rays that tries to annoy the viewer with that stupid ""searching for firmware updates"" on blu-rays equipped with the BD-live feature (which I feel is completely useless).",1347321600,,1365,4.376984126984127
2135031,5,B0002WYTWG,"I want to make one thing clear in this review. My five-star rating is for the movie, not the Blu-Ray edition of the film. Having just watched it on my system in Dolby Digital 5.1 all I can say is one thing: THE TERMINATOR needs a SERIOUS remastering job.  Picture quality is barely any better than my own DVD copy. And unless you have a system that can do the audio in uncompressed PCM 5.1, there is absolutely no improvement in that area, either. If I have to rate the Blu-Ray instead of the movie, I give it only 3 stars instead of 5.

Now that that's out of the way, I'll get to the movie itself. It is a brilliant action adventure dealing with the subject of modern technology; it depicts a world where technology itself escalated to the point where we lose all control of it and it winds up destroying us. Watching THE TERMINATOR, it became clear to me that James Cameron wasn't lazy when it came to writing the screenplay. Every angle is clearly thought out, especially in how the events are linked; how one act is ultimately tied to another one.  In THE TERMINATOR, and every other film he has done since then, Cameron demonstrates how story and characters are the most essential thing to any great movie.

By now, everybody knows the story. In 2029, the world was all but obliterated in a Nuclear War. Machines were fighting a war against the human survivors. Then the machines, in a last desperate act, send an unstoppable killing machine: The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to 1984 to kill a young woman (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to the man who will lead the human survivors in the war. At the same time, the humans send a young soldier (Michael Biehn) to protect the woman from The Terminator. The story is rather clever. If you really pay attention to the film, you'll discover what I was talking about in how everything that happens, from the future to the present, is completely tied together.

I remember when this movie was advertised on TV in October, 1984. It looked like a really wild ride of an action movie. I missed the opportunity to see it in theaters. I saw it for the first time on VHS tape the following year. I knew about Arnold Schwarzenegger as a champion bodybuilder, and also from the two Conan movies he did in 81, and 82. I thought he was a man with a great physique but a terrible actor. I didn't think he would ever be able to make a movie that didn't depend on his muscular body, until I saw THE TERMINATOR. We see him naked in his first scene, and that is that. Schwarzenegger had to actually act in a movie, and his task in this film is to make you believe he is this machine; that there is a metal skeleton underneath his flesh and blood. He succeeds this task with the way he moves his eyes, head, and body. Watch carefully and you'll see he never blinks except in one scene where he fires a handgun.

Another man behind the camera steps out to make us believe in Schwarzenegger as a machine when The Terminator is injured. That man is the late Stan Winston. There is a sequence where the Terminator is damaged and has to do some maintenance on his right arm and left eye. You see Arnold slice into his arm to work on the mechanism that controls his hand movements, and pull out his human eye from the socket, revealing a red metal eye. It is amazing how Winston makes this illusion completely real. I often wondered how in the hell he did it. (I recommend reading THE WINSTON EFFECT, which was published two years before his death in 2008; it shows exactly how this was all done.) We later see Schwarzenegger with additional damage to his face and more of the metal skull underneath. It never occurs to the audience that this is all a makeup effect. Everything is just so seamless.

At the time I saw THE TERMINATOR I thought it was one of the most violent motion pictures of the 1980's. It wasn't until I saw the other films Cameron wrote and directed, including ALIENS (1986), THE ABYSS (1989), and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991) I discovered something else about the movie after I watched it again: It is still a violent movie, but it is also extremely intense. The more intensity a motion picture delivers, the more it drives you to the edge of your seat. And that is something you cannot do with violence alone. That intensity became a pattern with every film Cameron has directed in the 28 years since THE TERMINATOR first came out. It made Arnold Schwarzenegger into a star, and James Cameron into a real director. He has been one of my favorite filmmakers ever since that day in 1985 when I first popped this movie into my VCR.",1347062400,,4601,4.444312796208531

2135051,5,B0002WYTWG,"Since Ah-Nold has recently returned to his acting career, it seems very appropriate to review the movie that made his career in the first place.

Watching The Terminator (1984) today makes me realize how much the action genre has fallen. Call me a nostalgic but I loan for the days when action movies were intelligently crafted, fun to watch and even easy to follow, the movies of John McTiernan, Walter Hill, Don Siegel and James Cameron. Nowadays, it's nothing but explosions, explosions, explosions. Even worse is that all these movies are shot with rapid cuts and quick edits, disrupting the visual flow and causing more headache and confusion than pleasure and insight. To be fair, there are some directors in that genre that try (Christopher Nolan, Paul Greengrass, Guillermo Del Toro, just to name a few) but honestly, watching today's action movies is a complete eyesore.

That's why watching The Terminator for the first time in five years is a breath of fresh air. Even its simple premise is a welcome relief after the overly labored plots of today's movies: in 2029, in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, machines have overrun the planet and are engaged in a war against the few surviving members of the human race. To ensure victory over the humans, the machines send a terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will give birth to future human resistance leader John Connor. To thwart their plans, the human resistance sends in one of their own soldiers, Kyle Reese, (Michael Biehn) to protect Connor and stop the terminator.

By a lesser director's hands, The Terminator could have come off as a kind of amateurish, low-budget schlock that would have impressed Roger Corman. But through James Cameron's skillful direction, this potential candidate for Z-grade turkey of 1984  was transformed into a stunningly well-conceived action thriller that transcended its minimal budget. The Terminator is a masterwork of action film storytelling, shot and edited to achieve a relentless pace but never at the expense of the human element. For example, in a clever use of exposition, Cameron has Biehn tell Hamilton what is going on in the midst of a car chase. Even though it's 108 minutes, The Terminator finds the perfect balance of great action and human drama, using special effects for the sake of storytelling instead of the other way around. By comparison, Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), which ran two and a half hours, boasted stunning visuals but featured thin characterization and a muddled plot.

Cameron is a pro when it comes to action and indeed there is a gallery of such set pieces like the police station shoot out and the climatic highway chase scene. But the movie is also rich with character development, particularly the relationship between Hamilton and Biehn, which forms the emotional core of the movie. Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor, who throughout the movie undergoes a transformation from a sweet, confused innocent to a strong-willed female warrior, a recurring theme in James Cameron's work, from Aliens (1986) to Avatar (2009). Hamilton makes Connor's transformation believable as she starts out as a carefree waitress to victim on the run and eventually fighter against the terminator. Biehn is terrific as Reese, whose battles against the machines in the future have drained him of so much pain and feeling.

But, of course, the real star of the picture is Arnold Schwarzenegger as the terminator. Schwarzenegger's terminator ranks as one of the most menacing villains in all of movies, persistent, unreasonable, remorseless and completely devoid of feeling. This is Schwarzenegger's best performance, in which he uses his limitations as an actor to make the character come to life and even add doses of black humor. Some of my favorite scenes in The Terminator are the ones where Schwarzenegger isn't committing mass slaughter but when he's hunting for Sarah and Reese, rather he's in the parking lot, his eyes moving back and forth like a surveillance camera; mimicking Connor's relatives to locate his prey; or giving a caustic reply to a guy complaining about a ""dead cat"". It's subtle moments like these which make The Terminator a breed apart from action movies today and it would be nice if today's action movies could add some subtlety, alongside their bombastic explosions, as well.

The Terminator deservedly became a box-office hit in 1984 and launched the careers of director James Cameron and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Cameron would return to the Terminator seven years later with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which had greater action scenes, more sophisticated special effects and shot with a considerably bigger budget. I love T2 (which is on my list of 100 favorite movies of all time) but the tough, gritty nature and nihilism of T1 somehow feels fresher. The ending where Sarah Connor drives off to the desert with a severe thunderstorm lurking, knowing what is in store for humanity's future, feels more emotionally resonant than the T-800's descent to the molten steel in T2.

The Terminator (1984) remains one of the best action movies ever made and a necessary tonic to today's soulless headbangers. Indeed, we need action movies like The Terminator today to show that there is more to the genre than pyrotechnics and fast cuts.

2135053,5,B0002WYTWG,"Arnold is back, this time as a friendly cyborg against a living metal adversary in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. What's new about the Skynet Edition is the film is expanded, and the interactivity (including Blu-Ray Live) is about as extreme as it gets regarding T2. I did not have a 2.0 compliant player that connects to the Internet, so I cannot comment about the live content, which tends to be dynamic and therefore could/might change if I were to comment about it anyway.

The total runtime of the extra content is not 30 or even 20 minutes if I recall, but it does make parts of the film make more sense or at least a bit better laugh, like when the T1000 is asked, ""Are we learning yet?"" These clips, put back in, perhaps add a little more gratuitous gore and cyberbabble to the story, which is likely why they were cut out of the theatrical version, which you can opt to view as well.

As with well-made Blu-Ray movies, the image is sharp as a tack, the sound of explosions and other sounds are very real and visceral, and really put you into it. It makes me wish for a surround speaker system!

This is a classic, both of Schwarzenegger's action films, and of the cyborg menace sci-fi flicks that came before and after. It had some cutting-edge effects for its time, and some still are seldom used or seen today. It's one of those amazing films that comes cheaply, easy to add to your library and keep to remember when sci-fi was a mix of effects, mind games, and terror. It's a pretty wild ride.",1343174400,,1502,4.415162454873646

2135058,5,B0002WYTWG,"I hadn't watched this in years and, to be honest, I was somewhat trepidatious about how it would hold up. As it turns out I should have known better; it's every bit the smart, emotive powerhouse I remembered, and miles better than most modern efforts in the same niche. One of the things I find most impressive about it is the respect it maintains for the original, where most sequels of this type (including T3 and Terminator Salvation) can't wait to distance and differentiate themselves from their lineage. Even though the first Terminator had aged quite a bit in the seven years between films, T2's sharp, daring script constantly cites events, characters and situations from its timeline like a religious zealot thumping the bible. It also builds directly upon the dark, challenging themes and premonitions of its predecessor, resulting in a towering, substantial world that seems so real I could almost touch it. Of course, I'd be silly not to mention the still-spectacular action scenes, which flawlessly build in size and scale until they reach a timely crescendo at the end of the third act. CGI was still in its infancy in the early '90s, but James Cameron's knack for its timely, appropriate application is already at veteran levels in T2. As a direct result, those infamous scenes with a transmorphing T-1000 remain striking and impressive, where other effects of the period now seem clunky and unrealistic. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, it's among the very best of the batch in multiple genres, and Arnold has never been more at-home in a character.

6/07: Considering the year that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was made, I've got to be surprised it had been a while to the point where there is a recent influx of pictures with high dependency of special effects in less than a decade. Yet Terminator 2: Judgment Day is neither the film that The Terminator is nor an exhilarating movie experience. Rather it was a chore for me. The first hour was crippled with excessive show-off of special effects and horrendous acting, not to forget to mention the annoying presence Edward Furlong emitted. Surprisingly, Terminator 2: Judgment Day made serious improvements in the second hour with less reliance on special effects as well as everybody's acting had greatly improved. The final thirty minutes of the picture was a reminiscent of Cobra's ending. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only thing watchable in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and that's why I got interested in this second part. The original was way ahead of its time, a classic in its own right, but Terminator 2: Judgment Day was half of that. A quite overrated picture that offers nothing but flash-in-the-pan stuff. Special effects alone do not constitute movies, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day was quick to correct itself in the second hour. As to the story, it is not too bad at all, but it certainly almost feels like as if I've went through this already before. This is probably a stupid question. Say, if Kyle Reese wasn't born until maybe around 2000, following the logic of time, John Connor would be born around 1984 or so. Then, the question is...who comes first? John. So, my point is: if John was first, how could Kyle be his father, considering that Kyle would need to be alive in 2029 or something and get to 1984? To elaborate further, if Kyle wasn't there, then how John can be born? If a different father, does that alter the make-up of the leader? If you think about it, you know that you have a stupid dilemma on hand that would defeat logic. Considering how good the original, I rather not pursue it because I know the logic is self-defeating. As for Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it was too overlong chore for me. Today, the picture has since become vastly overrated. Stick with the original.",1338595200,,2234,4.728205128205128

6/07: The Terminator is so good that it is an absolutely devastating picture. This is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger famous. So famous that if the film wasn't made, he wouldn't be the governor of California today. The bodybuilding work in the former days has served Arnold extremely well because he was born to be ready to play the Terminator. His Terminator is a magnificent villain. So unstoppable that it is impossible to conceive something so awesome as itself. There are many great scenes in The Terminator, and even the ones when the Terminator goes in a slow-motion in a menacing but mission-driven look before he unleashes firepower on those poor hapless victims. The Terminator is lightly, perhaps some medium, a horror picture but heavily of a science-fiction kind. The truth of the birth of the role for Arnold is when he was arranged to meet the director James Cameron in some restaurant, Arnold wanted to audition for the role of Kyle Reese. But James Cameron looked at him and said, ""My God! You're the Terminator!"" Arnold replied, ""No, no, no...I want to play Kyle."" At that, Cameron goes, ""Absolutely not! You are the it. A machine!"" Of course, I am paraphrasing, but you get the idea of the magnitude. One actor did not earn enough credit for his work, and that is Michael Biehn. He totally set the tone of the picture by heightening the realism along with the stark tone in how he described the Terminator and the future. He really created The Terminator the film by his attitude, and Arnold Schwarzenegger did the rest of the work. His performance as the Terminator is 100% pure Oscar work. The reason for this is his ability to create this robotic feel, movement, and action. Combining all of that with his brawn, who can replace Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator? Meanwhile, we can thank Stan Winston and his staff for their excellent special effects work. Yes, The Terminator is one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. Before The Terminator, there was nothing like it. A haunting, devastating, and thrilling picture.

6/12: This is the film that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name, and he will continue to be one forever. The Terminator is a devastating picture because how do you really stop a Terminator that is made of all metal? I thought the last thirty minutes was a bit ridiculous and illogical. I've been thinking that a machine should do everything as perfectly yet it couldn't correctly aim for Sarah and Reese amid the chase? That's impossible. Also, it's just may as well be so that all of the three end up in a factory that happens to be unlocked for them, and it seems perfectly capable of dealing with the Terminator. Reese summed up the film succinctly well and what it means to face the Terminator, ""Listen, and understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."" All in all, despite the logic flaws, The Terminator is filled with classic scenes and will always be regarded as a masterpiece.",1338595200,,3157,4.78021978021978

2135084,4,B0002WYTWG,"This review is for the German Steelbook version of T2: Director's Cut only, on HD DVD format.

Just wanna start off by saying i am a big fan of HD DVDs, mostly because they're no longer produced and sort of collectible, also because they have quite a lot of integrity, high quality menus, lossless sound (in this case the German company ""Kinowelt"" went all the way and added 7.1 channel DTS surround sound), all the extras and special features of the US blu ray counterpart (some in German only) except the theatrical and special code editions of the movie, and... Oh yeah,  the movie is mastered in Full 1080p High Def! If ur a fan of rare items with integrity, then definately get this steel case high resolution disc, and don't worry the movie was produced in both German 7.1 and Englisch 7.1, also a 2.0 Englisch surround sound headphone option for those of us who only have a stereo or quadrophonic sound system, (like me).

I've never seen T2 look better, even though the film was originally shot on Super 35mm grain film stock. This master is about 80% HD transfer, yet does still carry some of the grainy look in several scenes. I would definately buy this great item again, just wish ""Kinowelt"" would have included the theatric and special CODE edition of T2, and that the SKYNET link from 2008 was still supported by some kind of back up website... Overall the director's cut on this disc is well worth the $$$, especially this HI-RES transfer, surround sound, 50+ special features, and steelbook case. The movie and all features were burned on only 1 disc for whatever reason.

I had a ball experiencing T2: Ultimate HD edition... :)

I personally think it is a great achievement in film making (especially if you consider the budgetary and other constraints) and after 28 years, it still holds his power as one of the most beloved science fiction movies.

I had reservations about buying the Blu-ray as I have read many negative reviews here on Amazon. I ended up buying it from Target only for $8 (which is unusual as I buy almost all of my movies from Amazon). I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see that Blu-ray transfer was actually quite good, if not without flaws.

It is not very grainy but there are scenes in the movie that suffer from artifacts (I most noticed it in the scene where The Terminator is talking to the punks and later during the flashback where a terminator infiltrates the compound and starts firing his weapon). I think it would be wrong to expect it to look crystal clear like the movies that were made in the last 5 years. HD audio is excellent.

Although artifacts didn't bother me that much, if they were removed, the picture quality would be better. There are talks about a new and better Blu-ray edition being in the works to release early next year. If you can wait (and don't want to spend $8 - $10), then the upcoming edition might be a better choice.

2135091,4,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 has been reviewed to death so I'll focus on this edition.

This edition has had more noise reduction applied to the video removing most of the grain. Some will not like this but it does not look like plastic as is the case when too much noise reduction is used and to my eye it brings out more clarity and fine detail. Blacks are ok but can be on the grey side and a bit too bright.

Sound is great with the DTS-HD MA 6.1 lossless track. Only negative I can hear is that some sounds are in the wrong location in the sound field.

The extras are a bit underwhelming and mostly recycled. The menu is fairly hard to navigate and most of the time only stays on screen for several seconds before vanishing.

Overall not much is wrong with this edition and is well worth the $6 I paid for it.",1334707200,,799,4.135483870967742

2135093,5,B0002WYTWG,"As a fan of the Terminator series, I found this release to be exceedingly full of special features and materials that made the viewing experience the best so far for T2.  I loved the high definition transfer, the clarity really holds up well even the special effects while dated by today's standards held up well especially in high definition.  The biggest reason I picked this up was due to the pricing, for a blu-ray with all of these features and at a low price, especially for a movie I'd consider to be a classic, it's hard to resist.  One note to warn some people, older blu-ray players without much internal memory may prevent you from loading all of the features, and some features do require internet connection, but there is enough content on the blu-ray that you won't feel as though you are missing too much.

Pros:
* High Definition
* Low Price
* Great features, behind-the-scenes, and very well done menus with great animation

Cons:
* Some content requires internet connection and/or internal memory on your blu-ray player.",1334016000,,1038,4.776536312849162

2135097,5,B0002WYTWG,"Writer/director James Cameron's original Terminator film has Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg sent back in time to 1984. He's programmed to kill Sarah Connor before she can give birth to a son who is destined to lead survivors in a post-apocalyptic war against a self-aware computer network and its army of killing machines.

In an example of the future affecting the past, John Connor, Sarah's adult son, dispatches a trusted aide named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect her from the nearly indestructible cyborg. Sarah bonds with Kyle in their mutual struggles. They make love and thus John is conceived.

THE TERMINATOR was a huge summer hit, grossing $78 million worldwide in first run vs. a $6 million cost. Its sequel, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was long in coming, but well-worth the seven year wait. In almost every respect, this sci-fi thriller surpasses its predecessor. The concept of TWO terminators in the story equalling twice the film just may be true, thanks in large part to Robert Patrick's grimly determined T-1000 prototype, a superior poly-alloy mechanism capable of morphing into anybody (or thing?).

Sarah (Linda Hamilton), who was understandably confused and terrified in the first movie is now confident, buff from working out, and ready for the coming conflagration. Her only obstacle is confinement in a prison-like psych ward. Arnold returns as Cyberdyne model 101, but this time his mission is to protect, not kill Sarah, and especially young John (Edward Furlong). Again, the unseen adult John is trying to make sure he lives in the pre-machine war past, and Arnold is his weapon and shield against a superior cyborg. The battle between the two terminators is epic and to the death, but first, Sarah must be freed.

""T2"" is enhanced by brilliant Industrial Light & Magic special effects and the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston. The pace is breathless, the sense of danger unflagging, and the action, mesmerizing.

This is one great movie!

2135106,2,B0002WYTWG,"You're better off with the HD DVD version of this movie instead.

The movie itself is worthy of 5 or more stars, but the transition to Blu-ray is awful.  There's absolutely no difference between the HD DVD version and the blu-ray.  Film grains are STILL seen in the Skynet Edition.  The picture looks very clean and high-def in brightly lit scenes, but in darker environments, the graininess is ridiculously noticeable.  You would think that they'd clean that up!

Also, if you notice, nowhere on the blu-ray case itself does it say the magic code, 1080p.  Usually, the 1080p designation indicates a crystal-clear image without any major film grains.  Since that's nowhere to be seen on the case, expect the picture to be on the crappy side.

Lastly, please note that your Blu-ray player has to be connected to the Internet in order to play this film, and you need to have sufficient hard disk space in order to download the extra features.  Unless you have a PS3, make sure your blu-ray player has enough space or attach a USB drive or external hard drive to it.  Without those peripherals, the movie will not load at all.

So in summary, this is a 5-star film, but it's a one-star Blu-ray.  I gave it an extra star because I got it super cheap (less than six bucks).  I bet you it's that cheap because of exactly what I said above.",1331769600,,1333,4.546218487394958

2135110,5,B0002WYTWG,"A wonderful modern version of the oldest of all tales...
TERMINATOR is a movie purely incredible in many ways, but the two best things in it are first the successful modern retelling of THE tale mentioned in the title, (a tale which appears at least once in all human cultures since the dawn of time) and then the unique and powerful love story. There are also many other treasures in this film (see below, at the end of the review).

But first, the tale. From distant and terrible future comes to present day the Dragon (or if you prefer you can call it the Beast, the Monster, the Destroyer, or any other similar name). This Dragon is a powerful and cunning monster - it hides its real form (and it can even disguise its real voice), it doesn't feel pain, it never sleeps, it doesn't need to eat, drink or even rest, it knows no mercy, no fear, no doubt - and as if it was not enough, all its vital organs are covered with nearly indestructible armor... Few of those who will cross his path will live to tell the tale - and even those lucky few will be marked by its passage for ever, in their chair and in their mind. Oh, by the way, the Dragon looks very much like Arnold Schwarzenegger...

The Dragon came for one and only one reason - it must find and slay the Princess (in some versions of this story also called the Maiden, although in this particular case she is probably no more qualified...). The Princess name is Sarah Connor and she bears a strong resemblance to young Linda Hamilton. She is absolutely not aware of her importance and being born in a very average family, she lives a rather banal life of hard labor and simple pleasures. On the surface she is a very average young girl, barely out of her teens, not very bright, not very ambitious, not very courageous (at least in the beginning in the movie), cute but not really a stunning beauty - but in fact she is the most important woman in human history since Virgin Mary! And if the Dragon finds her and kills her, all humanity will perish with her!

Lucky for her and the whole humanity, the Dragon has been tracked and followed by the Knight (the Prince, the Paladin, the Hero, the Warrior, the Monster-Slayer, the Great Hunter, etc.) who swore to save the Princess (and therefore the whole humankind) no matter what the price, without any regard for his own safety. This Knight, who looks like Michael Biehn, is still young, but in the same time he is already a precociously aged battle scarred veteran, who slayed many a lesser dragon before, but who never yet faced such a formidable foe as this particular Beast. Even worse, he had to leave his magic sword (here called plasma rifle) behind, in his own times... For that reason the Knight can not just face the beast and slay it - he must first find the Princess and place her in a safe place and only then find a way to outsmart the Dragon, to have at least a chance in the unavoidable confrontation. And that will really, really NOT be an easy quest!

The TALE would not be complete however if love did not intervene. And surprisingly TERMINATOR, when one looks carefully, is in fact a story about an incredible love. A love completely mad, passionate, burning, tragic, condemned from the beginning, without any hope to be fulfilled but which will ultimately defy the time, the destiny and even the death itself - and triumph! And it may well be, that by this love the whole humanity will be saved - or at the very least get a fragile second chance...

As promised, here are some other treasures you can find in this movie. There is the excellent camera work, great music and an incredible atmosphere of a great city (Los Angeles) at night with its game of lights and shadows - all of which is the trade mark of great James Cameron, who signed here his first masterpiece. There are excellent second roles of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen. There are action scenes which still are impressive 28 years later and which did not age at all. There is the archi-famous Schwarzenegger's line ""I will be back"", which contains so much menace in it that I still shiver when hearing it even if I watched this movie like 20 times already. And finally, there is the water and fire proof perfection of scenario which appears in its full glory in the last two minutes of the movie...

I can not find any more words which could praise this movie enough, so I will stop here, inviting you with all my heart to discover this immortal tale, in which the Dragon, the Princess and the Knight will meet their respective fates... and in which they will all lose... but in the same time they will also all win (as it is explained with more detail in the less magnificent, but still very honest sequel).",1330992000,,4721,4.458333333333333

The sci-fi movie isn't about exploration of the universe and dealing with irrational humanity - as usual.  Instead, it's about humanity fearing the machines might get too smart(and then, of course, someone just outwiting the machines) and destroy us wonderful smart humans.  Anybody ever hear of the dark ages?  How about how the Judeo-Christian bible saying how evil humanity is?(you know, the flood story; wipe out all those evil others - except of course the chosen ones Jews).  And of course, this story sidesteps and neutralises the fact that the problem with guns and technology isn't the technology, but the 'people' using it!

2135124,4,B0002WYTWG,"As already described by another reviewer, this movie isen't logical and that is the main issue that I have with it.  The entire movie is built around the idea that in the future A.I. will challenge the human race and try to wipe it out. In the movie A.I. and robots take control of the USA's nuclear weapons and uses them to start a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, remember the movie was originally released in 1984, when the Cold War was still around. The mission of A.I. is to get rid off the human race entirely, so that it can reign supreme and unchallenged in the future. Now just hold that thought for a second or two. If it was the mission of A.I. to wipe out the human race, then it could have been accomplished fairly easily by using the nuclear arsenal of the USA to destroy the world. After all, the USA's arsenal back in 1984 had an overkill capacity to destroy the entire human population of earth many times over. So why would A.I. just target the Soviet Union to start a nuclear war, why not target the rest of the world population? That is the crucial question that this movie never answers, for the simply reason that it can't answer it, without conceeding that its simply not logical for A.I. to not target the rest of humanity with its overkill capacity once it has control over Skynet (the computer system that controls the nuclear arsenal of the USA)! The entire story line thus becomes redundant. Why sent a terminator through time to kill the leader of the future resistance movement of humanity, if he or rather his mother could have been killed via nuclear weapons, even earlier.
Of course, we all know that if A.I. had actually used its intelligence (lol) then there wouldn't have been any need for a terminator to be sent back in time to kill whoever. And that would mean that the movie would have been about 5 minutes long, lol... That was of course unacceptable to the producers of this movie. I am surprised that apparently only one reviewer actually realized just how illogical the whole plot of the movie is. Actually, its so illogical that one could drive trucks through the flawed story line!
Nevertheless, the movie itself is great. The acting is solid; there's lots of action in it, and if you can actually forget the illogical character of the movie, you can actually enjoy it. But for the illogical part, I just had to rate the movie down accordingly.

2135132,5,B0002WYTWG,"It's been a while since I watched this flick and I figured now would be as good a time as any to revisit.  I won't get too wordy, because everyone and their mother knows this movie inside and out.  It was one of the most influential flicks when it was first released, especially in the terms of visual computer effects.  The effects still hold up, after all this time.  James Cameron, Stan Winston and the team of practical and visual effect folks on this movie are at the top of their game, delivering a movie that looks better than a lot of todays FX fests.

I'm one of the few that actually prefer the first one over this one.  To me, the original Terminator was scarier and creepier.  The thought of an unstoppable killing machine on your trail with the only human (yet very resourceful) Kyle Reese to protect you was a terrifying one.  It was more of sci-fi meets horror and it was extremely effective in what it set out to do.  The sequel is more of a blockbuster sci-fi action movie that does what it sets out to do just as effectively, so which one you prefer probably depends on what genre you prefer your Terminator in.  That said, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is still flat out full of awesome.  It does a lot of things right; you have Arnold at the very top of his game, Robert Patrick makes a very worthy opponent as the liquid metal T-1000.  The action is top notch and delivers the goods in very satisfying ways.  The major flaw I find in the film is that it suffers ""Annoying Kid Syndrome.""  I understand that John Conner is an important part of the story and in fact what drives the story along.  But man does he come off as a whiny little brat.  Cameron has a little too much fun trying to make Conner the quintessential early 90s rebel teenager with all the outdated slang and annoying attitude that goes along with it.  Sorry, it just seems too self aware and corny, especially for this day and age.  That aside, I did like the relationship John developed with the Terminator, I felt that part of the story rang true.  A boy and his killer robot.  Like I said, though, I won't get too wordy, you already know if you like this movie or not.

The blu ray portion of the movie, I feel is kind of a mixed bag.  I've always like the blue-tinged look of the movie and it's about as sharp and crisp as I've ever seen it.  I'm currently in between surround sound systems at the moment, so it would have been nice to have a 2.0 audio option to help out with the sound on my TV.  I'll be honest, I don't have the ideal setup to fully take advantage of the Blu Ray experience, but I would imagine that the surround sound audio option is fantastic for those that have it.  For those with wireless internet turned on, the menu (while it does take a loooong time to load) becomes unsettling, as it takes on the persona of Skynet who is tracking your every move.  It's almost durn near convincing as I find myself looking over my shoulder now to see if Skynet is hovering behind me somewhere watching me type this out.  Of course, it's probably in my personal computer too.  Dang.  Anyways, I thought that was a nice touch to give it a feel of Terminator conspiracy.

The special features are where I feel a little cheated.  Now there are directors and crew commentaries, and that's always nice, but other than that, there's a few deleted scenes and promotional trailers for the film.  The regular DVD had a ton of special features and I love me some special features.  I will say that the Blu Ray Live portion of this DVD has the most stuff I've seen in my meager Blu Ray collection.  You can watch a nice 30 minute making of doc, another doc that takes you behind the scenes of the ""extended version"" of the movie with all the scenes put back in and whatnot.  There's some Japanese promotional trailer material and stuff of that sort.  It sort of makes up for the lack of special features and docs on the main disc, but it would have been nice to see a more current in depth look at the making of the movie with the people involved in the movie.

Despite the gripes, I enjoyed the Terminator 2: Skynet Edition Blu Ray immensely.  It's a fun action movie on a great format for that type of movie that you can find for an outstanding price at the moment.",1325635200,,4258,4.316120906801007

2135134,5,B0002WYTWG,"I watched this flick as a child in 1992. 19 years later I bought this HD version and it just bring back the nostalgic value + the best AV experience ever! The clarity of the 20 year old film is just phenomenon. The start up screen as you load the Blu Ray show skynet loading requesting for internet access. You can press cancel to proceed to the main menu.

The main menu screen is very cool... showing the part structure of the T101 model. The T2 theme is playing in the background. Very cool menu indeed as there is beeping sound as you navigate through the menu. You can choose to play the theatrical release or the extended version.

The clarity of the image is superb. The DTS Master 6.1 soundtrack blow me away throughout the movie. The shotgun sound pumps away with my subwoofer pounding shot after shot. Rear surround is active and always keeping me on the edge of the seat. DAMN... I never enjoyed T2 so much before this.

Overall, it is a good buy for whoever that have not gotten any DVD or Blu Ray edition. I have read many reviews indicating too many re-release of this classic flick. I have not seen the rest but this really kick ass on my Onkyo surround system & Samsung LCD TV. This review does not include the extras as there are too many and yet to go through them yet, but they look good and hoping to go through every one of them during weekend!

  The director's commentary is insightful, as it was recorded in 2003, 10 years after the movie so he looks at it from perspective. He feels the movie still stands on its own merits and I agree. There is not as much CGI as you would think.

I read a lot of reviews saying that the video looks bad, and while it could have been cleaned up and remastered, it looks fine for what it is. Remember that it's a 20 year-old movie that was shot on a relatively low budget, and that much of it is supposed to look rough and gritty anyway.

2135149,4,B0002WYTWG,"This review is on the Blu-ray disc of T2, not really the film itself. As we all know, T2 is one of the greatest sequels of all time, as well as one of the greatest and most critically acclaimed action movies of all time - fantastically written story, wonderful acting, top notch effects (even over 20 years later!), and a good steady pacing all make T2 a classic that will live on for even more upcoming generations.
Finally we have the film on Blu-ray, and needless to say, out of ALL the versions that have already been released of the film in VHS, Laser Disc,and DVD formats, this SkyNet Edition is the one to own. It contains ALMOST everything all the other versions did, minus some things a previous THX certified 2-disc DVD edition did, at least of what is readily available on the disc itself. What do I mean? Well, even though Blu-ray can fit a lot more memory than DVD, there is simply TOO MUCH content from those older DVD editions that was able to fit on one Blu-ray disc. Therefore in order to get the fullest effect of ALL the other special features that were on the previous DVD versions (T2 3D making of, behind the scenes, etc), you will have to download them, hence you require a Wifi connection. There are more details but you'll just have to get the disc to find out, as I'm not a techy head hence do not really understand the details. Yet the film does have a plethora of content. I will also add that this version DOES have both versions of the film - theatrical and director's cut. There is a picture in picture and quiz and facts modes that can be set while watching the film, which the previous DVD versions did not have (because they couldn't, as only Blu-ray has the ability for various picture in picture while a film is playing). For this, I removed half a star, but it was not the only reason why, the rest has to do with the presentation itself.
T2 on Blu-ray really only looks and sounds as good as the TV you have it hooked up to. On a fairly recently released Samsung 42"" plasma, the film is a good Blu-ray transfer, though could've used perhaps an extra coat of cleanup. For the most part, the film looks very clean; most blacks are deep, shadows are smooth and colors are a bit richer. Still, the way this film is glossed over for Blu-ray seems sort of ""flat,"" and that same cleaner look that most older movies have, only due to the fact that there is only so much you can do with such old prints. I mean, it's no Lord of the Rings or Tron Legacy BD, and obviously they did not go through the same trouble to make sure it looked as good. It's a basic Blu-ray gloss over; it looks good, but a couple of more days in the workshop could've made it look fantastic. You will still notice some portions of grain and some left over ""pops"" and elements of random distortion from the original film print. Again, this is practically always the case with older films; another film you would see this in is the Blu-ray version of The Neverending Story. A cleaner movie, yet a somewhat ""flat"" look.
Audio-wise, the movie sounds good, yet at times can be uneven. All sounds come out richer than before, yet depending on your television the movie can do the ""low then loud then low"" game, or the ""flatter when louder sounds come off"" game. In other words, on an older HD television, you may get the irritation of having to deal with low sounding dialogue and quieter moments, only to be shocked when an explosion or gunshot hits, then all of the sudden the volume will go full blast, causing you to play with the volume continuously throughout the movie. On a newer television you'll get the ""let's make them hear EVERY sound"" effect game. That is, when some louder portions come up you'll notice the overall ""volume"" of that specific sound will lower in order to keep even with the rest of the movie. Moreover, sounds that were once lower will be purposefully raised so that they'll be audible.
Examples of this are in the beginning when the Terminator first acquires his clothes, he leaves the bar and ""Bad to the Bone"" begins playing. The song itself is normally supposed to sound louder than the rest of the film, but you'll immediately notice it's weaker and flatter tone due to the sound mixing trying to keep even. It doesn't deter too much, but it's still noticeable. Another example is when John Connor and his friend are riding his motorbike to the mall. They're blasting the stereo and John enters the tunnel area. At one moment his friend chants ""yeah!"" to the music, and normally this sound is lower, because obviously the bike is going and the song is playing, so his voice wouldn't be able to speak above it too high. Still, due to the sound mixing and in the attempts to try and keep it all even, you will hear his ""yeah!"" louder to an almost awkward and unrealistic sense. I dunno, in my opinion, a well mixed film soundtrack should keep as close to the original release as possible, in all volume levels and tones, yet just be, you know, cleaner and crisper. May Blu-ray discs seem to come off in their sound mixing in the same way, and though it's nice to have even volume during the film, it becomes a little too apparent at times, taking away from its theatrical originality.
Due to these reasons I give it 4.5 stars out of 5. Yes it is the definitive version of T2 to own (and hopefully the last ever released), but these flaws still do exist.",1319846400,,5385,4.423967774420946

On blu ray it looks better than ever.  The new lossless English 6.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sounds amazing and the THX Optimizer to configure your home theater is a nice bonus.  I do wish it had more versions of the film.  There are only 2 versions, theatrical and extended with 2 deleted scenes.

Having heard that this sort of things does actually occur with certain BDs (""Starship Troopers"" for example) I first connected a USB memory stick and hit the ""Retry"" button several times but to no avail.  I was just about ready to return the disc as defective when, finally out of desperation, I hit the ""Cancel"" button which, lo and behold, started the menu sequence.  If this is the studio's idea of a practical joke, I think it is in very very poor taste.

From then on the menu sequence keeps going on and on through one meaningless layer after another until finally you get to the ""Play"" button.  All of this takes a good bit of time to load and is quite annoying",1318896000,,1165,4.576923076923077
2135154,4,B0002WYTWG,"TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY
1991 / 137 min. / Rated R.

Synopsis: The cyborg who once tried to kill Sarah Connor must now protect her son, John Connor (Edward Furlong), from an even more powerful and advanced cyborg.

After The Terminator earned nearly $80 million at the worldwide box office, and did killer business on home video, a $102 million-budgeted sequel by writer-director James Cameron was unleashed less than 7 years later. For me, T2 was my first exposure to the Terminator franchise. I was dragged along to see it opening night with my sister and brother-in-law. The spectacle of the film certainly blew me away at the time. After seeing the movie, I obviously went and rented the first, and since then, I had eagerly awaited a third film - but let me not get too far ahead of myself here.

By the time Terminator 2 rolled around, Arnold was already a big star. He was coming off such hit films like Predator, Kindergarten Cop, and Total Recall, so in hindsight it's not too surprising that his return would amount to him being transformed into the good guy but that he'd also receive much more dialogue. Beyond that, Arnold's new look of black leather and sunglasses are just classic. As it should be, he is the highlight of the movie. The bad Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), is visually impressive (especially for its time), and the action is first rate, as is its CGI effects. The latter, handled by Industrial, Light & Magic, is perhaps the most famous and groundbreaking element from T2. We do, however, get more classic lines from Arnold - most notably, ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" - and we get a better performance this time around out of Linda Hamilton.

The dark and gritty tone of the first film is replaced, however, with a much sleeker and polished blockbuster feel. It certainly has an overload of some snazzy death-defying action sequences, some witty humor and even by the conclusion, you get a little sentimentality thrown in for good measure.

Critically speaking, the biggest issues I have with the film is that it does get a bit too heavy handed, it has inconsistent pacing (it needed more tightening) and admittedly, Edward Furlong is a bit on the whiny side. Nonetheless, T2 starts off exceptionally well, loses its footing at the midway point and recovers for a satisfying conclusion. It's an entertaining enough follow-up and it's undoubtedly one of the most influential films of the past 20 years. The film did manage to achieve a worldwide gross of $519 million in 1991 which to put into perspective for you, only Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and E.T. had grossed more at that time. T2 would be nominated for 6 Oscars, winning for sound, make-up, visual and sound effects. Ultimately, the movie would cast such a large shadow that any follow-up would be closely scrutinized --- and it most certainly was....",1318377600,,2856,4.78498985801217

2135157,3,B0002WYTWG,"This movie is awesome. Most of us have seen it and most of us love it or you wouldn't be reading this right now. I've owned 5 different versions of this on DVD, including the Skynet Edition. I got the same edition on Blu because I'm switching over my entire collection and this was on sale at the time. First off, I don't own a 60-inch Plasma with a 7.1 Surround entertainment center. I have a 37-inch LCD HDTV with a Sony Blu player. Picture is awesome through most of the movie. I did see lots of motion blur during some chase scenes and grain during some of the scenes with smoke, but I just chalk it up to trying to color match the effects at the time. Which brings me to the ghosting. There's a lot of ghosting in the dark scenes when trying to composite the scenes where the T-100 is morphing. It wasn't that noticeable on VHS and DVD, but with an HD transfer, you can really tell.

The sound is horrible on this disc. All of the dialogue is really low, so you have to turn it up. Then, someone yells, or there's loud music or the background effects erupt and my room shakes. I almost gave the dog a heart attack. I've seen this happen when watching TV and notice the commercials are way louder than the show I'm watching. It's a real pain. I was constantly turning the TV up and down. Features were awesome on the DVD. On this disc, you get about 7 trailers, several pic-in-pic docs for side-by-side comparison, 3 deleted scenes from the Extended Special Edition, and a few commentaries. My biggest gripe is the way that the disc is made.

The menu is a pain the ass, especially if you have it connected to the internet. It pings your general location and sets up a fake Skynet hunt for you. To top it off, all of those great behind the scenes, making-of documentaries (The Making Of T2 Featurette, T2: More Than Meets The Eye Featurette, The Making Of T2: 3-D: Breaking the Screen Barrier, etc) are on the BD-Live site. So, now you have to be connected to the internet and download all the content. Great, storage. More pain.

2135165,2,B0002WYTWG,"I am not writing this review lightly.  Being a sci-fi fan myself, and of the movies by James Cameron, from Alien to Titanic, I have now watched the original Terminator three times, and with each successive viewing, I come away more disappointed with the film.  So here goes my critique; I'll assume everyone reading this knows most of the plot details already.

First of, the whole context for the story-line is ridiculous.  Both Kyle Reese and the Terminator go back in time to find Sarah Conner.  The machine that sent them back was built by SkyNet, which is a fictitious A.I. that has taken over the world's military and enslaved humanity.  If SkyNet is smart enough to build a time machine to send this Terminator back in time to kill Sarah Conner, and was smart enough to send the Terminator to LA, where Sarah Conner lives, then why send a Terminator who has to buy guns?  It would seem more reasonable to send a Terminator containing a nuclear device, and just blow up LA altogether, which would surely either kill Sarah Conner, or render her infertile from the radiation.

But logic aside, lets look at the movie in closer detail.  The very first scene of the movie when the Terminator makes contact with people illustrates the physical capabilities of this cyborg.  He kicks ass, without using any guns.  So why does he need to go steal a bunch of guns?  In fact, it is clear that when the Terminator first finds his target in the nightclub, the amount of time it takes for him to draw a weapon is just enough for Kyle Reese to intervene.  Why not just walk up to her and break her neck.  It would have been much quicker, and in the noise and music of the setting, the Terminator might have gotten away with it unnoticed.  In fact, there are various times in the movie where the Terminator fails to terminate.  Probably the most glaring one is the truck chase scene near the movie's end.  Here we have the Terminator on a motorcycle chasing Kyle and Sarah in a sedan.  They crash and the sedan flips over, pinning Sarah and Kyle.  The Terminator is dragged away by an oncoming truck.  When it comes around, it does not run towards the flipped-over sedan to kill Kyle and Sarah straight away.  Instead, it takes the time to run the other way, commandeer a truck, start it up, turn it around, and drive towards them to try and run them over.  Sarah and Kyle are on foot, the most maneuverable form of movement possible by man, yet the Terminator decides he needs to drive a cumbersome 18-wheeler to try and catch them.  This is one of the glaring examples of a director killing logic so that the movie can have a couple of minutes of extra action scenes.  Utterly stupid and a waste of screen time.

Another drawback of this movie was the acting.  Its as if a bunch of writers came together and figured out the best way to make a movie with the minimal amount of acting skill.  For the Terminator part; well just find a big guy who can walk around firing away with a grim face and utter a line here and there.  For the rest, lots of ducking, screaming, and faces of shock and awe.  Of all the James Cameron movies, this probably has the worst acting of them all.

Maybe my biggest beef of the movie was the hairstyles.  I grew up in the 1980's, which is when this movie takes place, and I don't remember any of the adults having the puffy hair like they do in this movie.  Overall, a crappy movie that somehow struck a nerve with the American psyche.  It did however start a sub-genre within sci-fi films of men making machines that take over the world, i.e. the Matrix trilogy and Battlestar Galactica reboots owe their origins to this film.",1312934400,,3649,4.455505279034691
2135166,5,B0002WYTWG,"Some studios don't take the time to remaster and tweak (or whatever they do) when transferring their back catalogue to Blu-ray. They just slap them on this 'new' format, maybe redesign the menu screen in HD, and put it out for sale. Not so with this Skynet Edition of T2. Yeah, the menu looks grrrrrrrreat, but the movie itself looks absolutely flawless (I hear Batman Begins has a great BD transfer as well.) The dark scenes (in tunnels, at night...) have great contrast and subtle variences in the differing shadings. I'm sure you've read the other reviews for the DVDs since they're all lumped together, but this edition gives the third 'extended special edition' when the code 82997 (the date of judgment day-aug 29, 1997) is entered.",1312848000,,738,4.818897637795276

2135168,5,B0002WYTWG,"From the moment you hit 'play', this blows away at least half of my Blu-ray collection. The sheer number of options and special features, the menu interface, the soundtrack... everything is better, especially coming straight from watching the first Terminator film on Blu-Ray... check out my review of that travesty at your leisure.

The film transfer strikes me more than any previous viewings on several differing mediums: the stark colour contrast of blue environments and red Heads Up Display places the perceptions of the Terminators outside the realm of the living and breathing. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, there is only one detractor - the morphing of the newest class of Terminator, the liquid-metal T-1000. And that is a muted detractor, the transfer to Blu-Ray is that good. It seems the further into the movie, the better the T-1000 images get.

There is but one minor complaint with this Skynet Edition - the special features run during a viewing of the film; there is no option to watch them on their own. But like I said, it's a minor inconvenience compared to the surplus of material.",1311984000,,1113,4.883597883597884
2135169,2,B0002WYTWG,"It was with some dissatisfaction that I began to watch Terminator on my PS3 and 45"" Vizio. First, I had to double-check and indeed make sure this was a Blu-Ray and not a VHS recording. Serious - the film quality is stuck with the plot... in the 80's. The sound was not that impressive either when running through a pretty darn good 5.1 system. And to top it all off, the Special Features best aspect is a decent range of subtitles. At the end of the day, when Arnold promises to be back, it seems he didn't bring the quality content with him.

So, the movie itself is a classic, we all know that. And occasionally I enjoy the old school grainy pictures. But this is to date the worst Blu-Ray I have seen. It looks better when watching it on cable. Seriously. Stick with the DVD. Even paying $10 for this is more than a bit aggravating.",1311984000,,835,4.284810126582278
2135170,4,B0002WYTWG,"I'm going to write this review in 2 sections because of my differing feelings about the film itself, and its presentation.

First the movie. This is a beautiful version of T2; crisp and richly saturated to the point where it looks brand new. Digital effects often do not age well, but the admittedly early CG in this movie looks fantastic even 2 decades later, as do the masterful animatronics and prop effects. Terminator 2 remains a fantastic hallmark of dramatic action, fusing horror and sci-fi in an amazing unity of pure awesome that feels far faster than its 2-hour running time. Unlike T1, the BD is a definitive step up from DVD for this film, and I can recommend it to fans without hesitation. If you are watching the movie for the first time, this is the way to do it. I've seen T2 probably at least 20 times, but watching this I noticed a load of new stuff. You also get a good deal of deleted content here if you've only seen the theatrical cut before. Most significantly, Miles Dyson, the character who kind of INVENTS SKYNET, was relegated to a bit part in the theatrical cut. Here he and his family (including a daughter who was completely removed in the TC) are far better developed.

Now, the disk. This is possibly the most IRRITATING BD I have ever seen, and I own like 3 from Universal. When you first load it, it launches ""Skynet"" which looks up where you live and a bunch of local information as it ""targets you for nuclear strike."" It's a cute novelty but it took me over 2 minutes ON DSL and was UNSKIPPABLE. You may not have to put up with it if you turn off your wireless or whatever, but the bottom line is you shouldn't have to wait through a pointless novelty to see your movie. Once you're actually in the menu, you will find that although the theatrical and special edition cuts of the movie are available, the longest director's cut is PASSWORD PROTECTED. This isn't a trivial menu thing, it actually wants a password. I'm told you can skip this using root track selections instead of the BD menu, but it's still an example of the interactivity of BD menus totally running away from the viewer's needs.

SOOOOOOOOOooo.....

If you like T2, buy this movie in spite of the menu. If you haven't seen it before, buy it but brace yourself. If you don't like terminator and you're just a sad sack who buys every ""important"" movie that comes along for collector's value, then I recommend that you get the limited endoskull edition of this off eBay and just watch the DVDs.",1311033600,,2498,4.495594713656388
2135171,4,B0002WYTWG,"Because so many classic films get totally fantastic Blu Ray transfers, it's easy for a videophile to get spoiled and start expecting every movie to magically become beautiful in 1080p. That's just not the case, and nowhere is that more evident than here. The Terminator BD is a good quality version of the original, but the original film was shot a bit on the cheap, and it shows in hi def. Intensely grainy night shots, smudgy closeups, and dim indoor shots are all far more apparent here than on DVD or VHS. Keep this in mind when you order- what you're buying is a very faithful version of a rather budget film.

That said, Terminator is as exciting and fantastic now as it was when it first released, and this is the closest you'll come to seeing it as it originally appeared. The lurching endoskeleton of the terminator itself in particular looks wonderful in hi-def; you can really appreciate all the detail that went into it. And if you aren't a total slave to quality, you may actually enjoy the grain, scratches, and other film oddities that are largely missing from today's movies.

The disk itself is pretty basic for a BD, but that means fast loading times, and none of the irritating BR 2.0 novelties that plague T2. Overall I can recommend this as the definitive version of the film to buy new, and an upgrade, though not an essential one, from DVD.",1311033600,,1363,4.581967213114754

2135178,2,B0002WYTWG,"Saw this 1984 film on Netflix.  I had never seen it before.  Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cyborg from the future who is not human.  His mission is to kill a young woman (Linda Hamilton) because these creatures are going to take over the world but the son she will bear in the future will foil their plans.  However, Michael Biehn, who also comes from the future but is human is out to stop all this and save the world.

What follows are a lot of chase scenes, guns, explosions and other predictable special effects that were available to 1984 audiences.  This fight doesn't seem fair at first because the cyborg is not human and can grow new body parts when necessary.  However there is no doubt how it will all turn out.

The plot is simple, actually too simple for me.  Once I figured it out I fell asleep and awoke just once in a while to the sound of explosions.  I guess I'm just not into this kind of film.  But I'm glad I tried to watch it just to check it out.",1308528000,,972,4.2

Short of remastering the film frame by frame I doubt that you will ever get the picture or sound quality of let's say ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""

Face it Orion (the distributor) was not a major distributor and the Terminator was not expected to be the cult hit that it became.

There are many movies on the market which picture quality falls short of our sophisicated expectations.  As our audio/visual technology advances most of the movies that you are purchasing now will look like trash.

If you like the movie and have the money to spare don't let a review dissuade you.  See for yourself.  Rent a copy from Netflix or Red Box then make your decision.",1307577600,,800,4.705035971223022

It looks like they obtained the best print they could and cleaned it up. I am no film expert but I have heard that ""cheap"" film for low budget films from that time left a lot to be desired. Based on that it appears they have done a good job... so much so that you have no problem seeing Arnold's full frontal as he runs to the camera at the start of the movie. The film grain is apparent and you can see the model work and rear screen projection quite clearly if you know what to look for. Is it ground breaking re-mastery? No. But I think with the book and some extras with a little sweetening of the picture it may be worthwhile to add to your collection... at least till they release the 4k 60 frames per second 3D version...",1307318400,,886,4.187134502923977

I have down-rated this disc due to the intrusive non-standard additions.

Then there are seemingly endless commercial snatches at the start of the disc, each taking up time before the arrival of the main menu.

2135195,5,B0002WYTWG,"During the early 1990s when Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released on video and when I first seen it I was intrigued on how they went about making the movie tell more of the story where the first movie had left off.  There is one thing that I heard some people say is that James Cameron tried making this a family film and I have to say that no family film would go about having a 'R' rating.  Not only that what family film would have such language as the 'F' word in it, and I wonder what those people are thinking.  If there's anything I can say is if there is any in here that shows it as one I want to know, but it may have borrowed lightly of those kind of movies cause of John Connor only being a child in the movie.  Although in the last movie there was only one terminator sent back, this time two of them are sent back, take a guess which one is on what side.

While I grew up watching the theatrical edition of the movie, after picking up this version on DVD I was surprised that I got a copy of the movie with 16 minutes more of movie and wondered what kind of extra footage was restored back into it.  Some of the extra footage did help me better understand some points of the movie so I can see how some decisions of the movie came about as it got to that point in the movie.  The bonus features of the film, also helped me understand how they went about it as it took on the use of CG which at the time wasn't all that big at the time of the making of Terminator 2.

Even to this day I'm not sure what it is about The Terminator that I liked over the years probably cause the kind of story that it tells throughout it, one thing I don't see in many movies that I watch.  It's like a romance movie disguised as a action/sci movie, though I'm not one for those kind of movies but when it's like this I don't mind it at all.

James Cameron did well when he went about making this franchise the way that it is with the writing and the direction that he took the movie.  The acting itself has a superb cast with it and I don't know if there's many 80s movies that have a cast like with 'The Terminator'.

2135202,5,B0002WYTWG,"This review is not about the movie itself or the special features on the blu-ray disc - there are many other reviwes who already covered that part. For that I gave the movie the rating of 5 stars.

This review is about technical issues some users and reviewers seem to have (which included myself)

I think I figured out what the issue with the disc not playing on certain blu-ray disc players is - here we go:

First let me explain that several movie companies (Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal, ... etc.) at times offer a feature on their blu-ray discs which is called ""BD Live"".
BD Live is a special feature which offers additional online content, accessible from the Internet through your Blu-Ray Disc Player.
Usually this feature is optional and you can access it through the Special Features section on the disc or it has its own category on the disc menue.

However it means that your Blue Ray Disc Player needs to be ""BD Live ready"" to be able to access that content. So the first thing to check is if the blu-ray disc player you own has the ""BD Live readiness""!

Well, my blu-ray disc player is a Vizio and does offer BD Live - so far so good. However when I tried accessing the BD Live feature on various blu-ray discs (e.g. 'Sherlock Holmes', 'Terminator:Salvation') I always got a message from my player stating ""no storage media available""...

It took me over three months (until yesterday) to figure out that the error message practically meant that I have to put a Flash drive in the USB port of my Vizio blu-ray disc player.

Once I had put a 2 GB flash drive in the USB slot the BD Live feature of my 'Terminator Salvation' Blue Ray disc worked.
And be warned: It takes minutes for the features to download from the Internet if you have a slow Internet connection like I do (DSL)

After I was successful in getting the BD Live option to work I returned to my T2 disc, which refused to play in the past and simply locked up my player, ready to give it another try.
Voila! This time the disc played and the features are really awesome and stunning!

So the crux with the T2 Skynet Edition is that usually the BD Live feature is OPTIONAL (which makes sense, since not all blu-ray disc players offer the BD Live access), but in the case of the T2 disc the BD Live feature is MANDATORY!

This means your blu-ray Disc Player needs to have two things for the disc to work (= play):

1) The Player needs to have the BD Live readiness

2) The Player needs to have a storage device (such as a flash drive) connected to the USB port. (I don't know if there are possibly players on the market that have storage space internally, mine doesn't)

If you don't have both features your disc simply won't play, which is a shame and a stupid concept on the part of Warner Bros. They should have made the BD Live content optional or at least offer a bypass option.

This is my theory gotten out of my personal experience and I hope it is helpful for buyers of the blu-ray disc to avoid frustration over the issue!",1297209600,,3012,4.384201077199282

2135209,5,B0002WYTWG,"This film is a modern classic that should be a part of every movie collection.

That said, I wasn't expecting much out of this BD, as most BD conversions I've seen from 90's films are pretty lackluster in terms of audio/video quality. Believe me when I say that I was absolutely blown away by this one.

First off, 6.1 audio track is killer. It's about the only audio tracks that I'll run without any signal processing from my receiver (as much as I love using Dolby PLIIx, the pure audio sounds much better in this case). It blows me away every single time, even on my budget 7.1 speakers.

The picture quality is also phenomenal. Sharp as a knife without any graininess or pixelation. Due to space constraints, my sofa is only about 7 or 8 feet from my TV, so stuff like that tends to be a bit obvious.

Haven't gotten around to watching any of the special features or listening to the commentaries, but this is an amazing movie on an amazing BD. A disc that should be a part of every collection.

I canceled out of that, then waited... then waited... then waited some more. We walked down to the beach for a bit and came back... and it was still sitting on a black screen... it never played!

2135213,5,B0002WYTWG,"First thoughts...Amazing! Better than the first. You've got James Cameron back behind the camera and he is very talented, which he proves from this movie. Anyways, here's the breakdown.

1.  Directing--Of course this is going to be good! It's James Cameron (Avatar, Aliens, Titanic) again. Amazing job from one of the all time best directors.
2.  Script--Excellent story and writing from James Cameron and William Wisher. Better writing than the first one in my opinion. Nice job!
3.  Acting--Amazing again because you've got Arnold Schwarzenegger back as the title character. You also have Linda Hamilton back, Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong. Very nicely done.

Now for the content review.
Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language

1.  Sex/Nudity=1/10. Both terminators are fully nude at one point in the movie but there is nothing bad.
2.  Violence/Gore=9/10. More violent than the original. Many people are killed by both teminators throughout. There is not a lot of blood though.
3.  Language=7/10. Just a tad worse than the first one. 18 F-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. It is hands-down better than the first one and always will be the best in the Terminator series. Excellent job from James Cameron. Highly recommended to everyone who enjoyed the first one.",1292889600,,1319,5.208530805687204
2135214,5,B0002WYTWG,"First thoughts...Very good older movie. This was my first James Cameron film and there were more to come. Very original at the time it was made and one of the all time best films ever. (Not in my opinion, but in others). Anyways, here's the breakdown.

1.  Directing--Amazing job with the camera from lengendary filmmaker James Cameron (Avatar, Titanic, Aliens). The only thing I didn't like were the special effects, but at the time they were very good, so I won't complain.
2.  Script--Good writing by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd. It was an original story at the time it was made and it had good characters and dialogue.
3.  Acting--Amazing job because of the all-star cast. You've got Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton and Lance Henriksen. Very good job with the cast.

Now for the content review.
Rated R

1.  Sex/Nudity=6/10. Not bad but there is a sex scene between Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were bare breasts are shown. There is also a scene where the Terminator is shown fully nude, but it is in shadows and is kinda of hard to see.
2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. This is a violent movie. There are many people that get shot throughout the movie. Probably the most gory scene is when the terminator shoves it's hand through a man's chest.
3.  Language=7/10. Not too bad, but enough to ensure an ""R"" rating. 11 F-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. This is an amazing movie by an amazing director. It is a movie that any movie-goer must see before they die. Highly recommended to everyone.",1292889600,,1562,4.794776119402985
2135215,5,B0002WYTWG,"Every cast member was great in this sequel to ""Terminator.""  In my humble opinion, Linda Hamilton provided an Oscar-worthy performance of a highly distraught/borderline insane protector of her son.  Her transformation from ""Terminator"" to ""T2"" was amazing and displayed the range of Hamilton's acting ability.  Though Arnold certainly provides the gravitas, Hamilton provides the fragile consciousness of a human being besieged by a horrific reality and destiny.  Kudos too for Edward Furlong for portraying an inescapably repressed yet resourceful teenager.  I was stupefied and angry that Hamilton and Furlong were dumped for T3.

I'm a Christian Bale fan, but I was disappointed that he totally ignored Furlong's early sculpture of the eventual resistance-fighter John Conner.  A bit of continuity would have helped the franchise.  It's a pity that James Cameron let this fascinating drama slip out of his hands.  He dumped Linda Hamilton and everything connected with ""Terminator.""  The same thing happened after he directed ""Aliens.""  I don't know the Hollywood politics behind any of this, but I can't help but view Cameron as a fair-weather friend.  His success with ""Avatar"" is deserved but the drama of the flick is not up to the caliber of ""Terminator"" or ""Aliens.""

So, now, Linda Hamilton has seemingly disappeared from major theatrical releases.  Whatever the particulars, I can't help but feel sorry for her, as she turned in a stunning performance with ""T2.""  Maybe there will be a place for her in the next ""Hellboy"" movie.  I hope to see her again.",1292803200,,1565,5.224899598393574

Naturally I was irritated with this absolutely stupid move by MGM to re-release films with no Special Features (And in the case of blu-ray, do an improper upscale that looks no better than DVD.).

The film? Oh it was great, the quality was real nice too. Probably the only good thing about a DVD without any special features.

And a quick note, the case was one of those econo-crappy cases with the big gaps in the plastic to ""Save the environment"". I love the environment and all but I hate these cases. They feel so cheap and flimsy. I might just swap a different case out.",1289260800,,735,4.357664233576642
2135221,4,B0002WYTWG,"Believe it or not, I had never seen the original Terminator film from start to finish.  So, when I found it offered on Amazon at a good price, I decided to buy it.

Even judged by today's standards, when CGI and over the top special effects are run of the mill stuff, this 1984 film holds up very well.  The ""hunter/killers"" that fly over LA by night, shooting lasers at anything that moves are very well done for the time, as are the Terminators.  The piercing, red robot eye that Arnold's Terminator reveals behind his human flesh exterior is haunting, revolting and amazing, all at the same time.  The final confrontation scene, when the Terminator has been reduced to his naked, mechanical skeleton, is also extremely well done for the time, and again, those Satanic red eyes add to the suspense and uneasiness that the viewing audience feels as they watch this machine relentlessly pursue Sarah Connor.

The programmed determination of the Terminator becomes evident very quickly, and Reese's description of it to Sarah brings chills to one's spine, as he describes how the Terminator will never stop hunting her down, never stop trying to kill her as long as either she or he are still alive and operating.  How could anyone ever go to sleep again after finding that out?

Of course, the chase scenes are still some of the best that I've ever seen, and they move the pace of the film along at breathtaking speeds.  And, the famous ""I'll be back"" line that leads to an incredible police station shootout is as great as ever.

The Blu Ray transfer of this film is good, but it will not stun you with 1080p, super high def HDMI pictures.  I did not find anything to quibble about with the video quality, though, and for a transfer of a 1984 film, I was entirely pleased and was in no way distracted by any obvious video shortcomings.  Likewise, I was pleased with the sound mix on my 7.1 surround system, with much of the music and effects tracks coming through the surround speakers, while dialog mainly existed in the front and center channels.  Don't expect any big booms or earthshaking, sudden explosions from your sub, as they aren't there.  In my experience, the sub just added the overall bass and low key effects that were needed to fill in the rest of the tracks and make them realistic.  Overall, it was a very satisfying experience both video and audio wise.

This is the first film in a great action series, and I highly recommend it.  It'll be a classic, for sure.",1289174400,,2481,4.6022727272727275
2135222,4,B0002WYTWG,"As someone upgrading blu-ray collection and of course that means action films, the importance has always been first and foremost picture quality, then audio and any possible new featurettes. The transfer quality of this BD, compared to my version of DVD, shows a bit of improvement. The most improvement is in the on-screen text. I agree with the top reviewer that a DVD player/TV with quality upscaling engine should do just as good of a job on the DVD.

But regardless, at $8 it's well worth the purchase to round up the blu-ray collection.

UPDATE: Per comment posted I have gone back to compare my DVD version with the blu-ray again, but this time looking for more details. In some scenes (past the initial 2025AD opening) there are subtle details throughout such as wrinkles on the skin that comes through well on the blu-ray, and I don't believe it's possible with up-scaling/anti-aliasing technology today.

Picture Quality: 4/5

I think it looks pretty good. They used DNR in some scenes, but the film grain is intact in most scenes. I think most of film look sharp and detailed. Like for example in the closeups. I like that the colours looked good.

Audio Quality: 4.5/5

I was very suprised how good the PCM 5.1 audio track sounded. I think all those explosions sounded good with clear deep bass. All the shoouts in the present time sounded good in my opinion. The bass from the weapons was surprisingly loud and clear. I like that. When a Terminator in a flashback scene starts firing with his minigun like weapon, i think it sounded too low and lacked bass. Strange.

Other than that particulary moment in that flashback scene, i think those flashbacks scenes sounds good.
When Arnold fires with the Uzi, i think it should have had more bass. Too bad. I think the dialog at times sounds unclear and too low in the Center speaker. Apart from those 3 mentioned things, i think it sounds very good. As i said earlier, the subwoofer channel is used a lot to good effect. I really liked that the rear speakers was used a lot.

A worthy candidate for greatest sequel of all time (along with The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens and Toy Story 2), James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day delivers everything that a movie should deliver. It's got dazzling action sequences, spectacular visual effects, an intelligent human story, great characters and a nice blend of action, comedy and pathos, all wrapped in this one $100-million juggernaut. A welcome relief from the bloated misfires of Michael Bay, Rob Cohen and Paul W.S. Anderson, T2 is a movie that uses it budget for ideas and emotions instead of hollow gimmicks and indulgences, a movie that dares to thrill you emotionally and provoke you intellectually.

T2 is set nearly a decade after the original Terminator. In the first Terminator, cyborgs from the future sent a machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of human resistance leader John Connor. The plan failed when the human resistance sent Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah and together, they managed to destroy the machine. Flash forward a decade later: Sarah is committed in a hospital when she is falsely assumed to be insane; her son John (Edward Furlong) is raised by foster parents; and Guns N' Roses and Public Enemy are all the musical rage at the time. Once again, the machines send a Terminator (Robert Patrick) back to time, this time to kill John Connor while the humans send back a guardian to protect him. The twist, of course, is that the guardian is basically a replica of the first Terminator, except it is programmed to protect.

There are visual effects that are used to show off and then you have
visual effects that are used to tell a story. T2 rests in the latter category as the centerpiece of the special effects is the T-1000, a cyborg made of liquid-metal that can dissolve into various environments and possess the ability to turn into copies of the human it interacts. The T-1000 is a wonderful creation as we see him emerge from floors, transform into human figures, dissolve down from ceilings and create knife-like weapons from his hands and fingertips to kill. The genius of this special effect is that it is used for storyline purposes as opposed to visual pyrotechnics. In a brilliant sequence, the T-1000 jumps off a motorcycle from the top of the building onto a helicopter. After he headbutts the glass, the villain slithers into the cockpit like a silver snake before turning into his human form. The T-1000 then decides to use the helicopter to track down our heroes and kill them off. It is a brilliantly edited sequence that not only presents the awe of special effects as we see it but also helps advance the story a bit.

But to heavily praise the special effects is to overlook the human element, which separates James Cameron from his contemporaries that rely on showing off with computers. The relationship between T-800 and John Connor is simultaneously funny and moving; one funny bit involves John teaching the robot how to smile while in an amusing scene, John teaches T-800 how to not speak ""like a dork"" and say phrases like ""no problemo"", ""chill out dickwad"" and the now famous ""Hasta la vista, baby"". The genius of Schwarzenegger is that he can accept roles that are proper for him and make them transcendent and memorable. Unlike the stoic Sylvester Stallone, Schwarzenegger is an actor that is eager to open himself in ridicule, as shown in scenes mentioned above, thus creating a more believable character for anyone to like. He becomes a father figure to John and his impending demise at the end strikes an emotional chord given the relationship between the two.

Besides Furlong and Schwarzenegger, there are equally good performances from other actors, including Linda Hamilton as John's nihilistic mother with a grim outlook on humanity and Joe Morton as the troubled Myles Dyson, who is working on a new microprocessor that will unwittingly set the events for Judgment Day, the destruction of humanity. Cameron's skills with actors are often taken for granted and once again, he shows his skills at getting solid performances from a cast like he did in Aliens (1986).

As usual in a James Cameron movie, there are loads of exhilarating action scenes that will get audiences pumping. The opening car chase as the T-1000 chases after John Connor in a truck is a mind-blowing experience that is also visually playful: The T-1000's menacingly imposing truck chasing down John and his comparably tiny motorcycle is an amusing metaphor of how powerful this machine is compared to the puny, vastly vulnerable Connor. The third car chase, this time with the T-1000 flying a helicopter after the heroes in a S.W.A.T. van, is also an eye-opener as we see an amazing camera shot of an actual helicopter flying over and under the overpasses with ease. Sequences like this would have been via computer; here, it was all done in real life. And the final showdown between Arnold and the T-1000 is exciting as they fight in a steel mill, a symbol of two machines fighting it out in a domain or a setting that created them in the first place.

T2 is the apotheosis of what you call a ""labor of love"". Here is an action epic that is intelligently crafted, tremendously exciting and very witty. James Cameron often takes flake for his treatment of cast and crew members in pursuing a vision but watching T2 and all his other movies that have box-office successes, it is clear that not only do the ends justify the groans but such principles should actually be considered a good thing for a director.",1285804800,,5637,4.8473520249221185

2135234,4,B0002WYTWG,"The film? It's brilliant. But if you were considering buying this you'd know that already, so I'll be talking about the product here.

One problem with the release of older films on higher definition formats is that the picture quality does not do the extra definition justice. This may be the fault of a poor transfer or decay in the film stock itself, but whatever the cause really is, such lesser image quality is common in films up to and including those released in the Eighties - which is not very long ago at all.

Fortunately the picture on this 1985 movie is almost up to the razor-sharpness of a 1990s or 2000s film, quite enough to give you that extra enjoyability of the film experience that HD is all about. Sound is good as well, and you don't have to crank your volume to stupid levels - another common Blu-Ray fail. Extras are limited to deleted scenes and a 'retrospective', but who cares about having masses of surplus extras? Cameron's never been one for director's commentaries anyway, so you'd hardly expect to find one here.

2135238,3,B0002WYTWG,"Sony must think we just want any movie on Blu-Ray, so we can say that we have the best quality available of any particular movie.  I really wish these companies that release Blu-Ray would stick to the REASONS WHY we would upgrade our movie collections from DVD to Blu-Ray.

This release of ""The Terminator"" onto Blu-Ray is a waste of everybody's money if your intention is the same as mine as to get a High-Definition improvement of our favorite movies.  If it can not be made to look any better than the DVD, please don't release the Blu-Ray version of the same mediocre quality.  However, I know with today's quality enhancement skills being applied to many films, this movie could have been greatly improved for a pleasing High-Definition improved picture and sound.  We know it takes a pain-staking frame-by-frame articulate effort to improve video quality but it CAN be done.  It has been done by many movie companies already.  And only then, should our movies be converted to Blu-Ray so that it JUSTIFIES why we would want to buy the movie again.  Jeez, is that too unrealistic of an expectation?

Here are some words of deception used as well as some vague statements to explain what you're getting with this Blu-Ray release of ""The Terminator"":

On the front (bottom), it says: EXPERIENCE HIGH DEFINITION

The deception here is that this statement DOES NOT apply to this Blu-Ray disc.

And on the top of the back it says: BLU-RAY DISC TAKES YOU BEYOND HIGH DEFINITION

Again, that statement is not supported by this movie's un-enhanced transfer to Blu-Ray.  Shame on you, Sony!

Then, there is this rather vague disclaimer that I guess we should start to look for before we waste our money buying the Blu-Ray to replace our DVD:

Near the top on the back it says:

PURE (meaning unchanged and unaltered) PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY. TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE MASTER

Well, there you have what best explains that NO EFFORT has been made to improve this movie for transfer to Blu-Ray.  You're going to get the same un-improved video transfer as that of your DVD, and this Blu-Ray disc gives you less extras than the DVD.  And why is that?  So that, some day soon, they may actually apply that pain-staking, frame-by-frame, articulate effort to improve the video quality, and then put in all those currently existing extras that your DVD already has, so that they can sell the Blu-Ray version of this movie AGAIN.  Why else, would they leave out all those already existing extras?  It's a pre-calculated rip-off! It's a recognized release pattern that we've seen for years, and they still do it.  I believe George Lucas is the master of this corrupted ""bilk-the-consumer"" re-release then re-sell, style of profiting.  Sell it at a bare minimum for quality and content.  Then, improve on it, and then sell it again.

So, I hope this will be a lesson to us all.  And I've learned this with several Blu-Ray releases as well.  Just because it's been transferred to Blu-Ray, DOES NOT mean that it's going to look any better than your currently owned DVD.

So, buyer beware!  If possible, RENT IT FIRST!  So, you can compare it to your DVD.  That would save you money in the long run, don't you think?",1283299200,,3200,4.718411552346571

This may not be enough to justify an upgrade for some viewers, but at the low price Amazon is currently offering I find it perfectly justifiable upgrade.

Keep in mind that this Blu-ray release omits a number of the bonus features of the DVD if that makes any difference to you.  Personally, I want better image and sound first and foremost which this release offers, especially in the sound department.

Terminator 2 is a great sequel!  John Connor is a little punk with a juvey record with the LAPD.  His foster parents aren't much better.  While he is taking joy rides and robbing ATMs, two Terminators arrive from the future.  One, the Arnold Schwarzenegger model, is there to protect John from the second one, the T-1000, made of liquid metal and can form any shape.

The movie is mostly chase scene, really.  The unreal truck scene where this huge rig is flying off a bridge into the LA sewers.  Lots of car accidents ensue as John Connor dodges him.

The scenes where people get terminated are especially gruesome:  John's foster father gets sliced through the head while drinking from a milk carton.  Not a pretty sight.  Or when a security guard says it's his lucky day before getting skewered in the eyeball.  Yuk.

It does not take Sarah Connor long to learn that the Arnold model is her pal, as they ride through the streets of LA being chased by the T-1000.

Family scenes are a bit intense as well:  After John gets his mom out, thinking he just saved her life, she yells at him how stupid he was for doing that and that he's much more important than she is.  *sniff*

Another cool scene when they take the CPU out of Arnold's head.  She wants to smash it!  John says no, and 'if I'm supposed to be this great military leader, why not listen to some of my ideas once in a while?'  The dialogue is pretty good, though chain smoker Linda Hamilton does go a bit splooie sometimes -- probably due to her stay at the spin bin.

Funny scenes:  John trying to teach Arnold to lighten up!  Hasta La Vista, Baby.  And how about that snake farm?

Chilling scenes:  Children playing in a playground laughing just before a nuclear fireball.

And of course the search for Dyson, the inventor of the cyber chip that starts Skynet (which he also got from the pieces of Terminator from film no. 1).

The film is full of action and suspense, some humorous interludes and overall a fun, occasionally gory, sci-fi film.

2135266,3,B0002WYTWG,"I just recently re-watched TERMINATOR 2:JUDGMENT DAY (1991) to try to get some understanding as to why SO MANY movie fans think that it is the best of the Terminator films and having seen it, it is worse than I thought! I was sure that I would at least think T2 was good enough to rate closely to it's predecessor T1 and boy was I mistaken! I first saw T2 back in the early 90s and it really didn't blow me away even back then. But that was more due to the fact that I had suffered sequel overload during that time (DIE HARD 2 and LETHAL WEAPON 2 being the main culprits, both of which I loved at the time and can't stand now!), but also that I was more into Arnold Schwarzenegger movies (three Arnie action classics PREDATOR-1987, RUNNING MAN-1988, and TOTAL RECALL-1990 had just come out) than I was into Terminator movies. I just wanted to see an Arnie action film! I know the Terminator is supposedly different from the typical Arnie flick, but I wasn't fully aware of this at the time. In retrospect, I understand better what the Terminator films encompass.

With T2, I kind of got an Arnie action film, but not really; it's more of a James Cameron film, which for me, is not really a good thing. I think Cameron is perhaps the most overrated director in modern film history! In T2, Arnie's T800 is really only a nominal (although above the title credits) character; and plays 2nd fiddle to Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton, who overemotes mightily in this) and 10-year old John Connor (an annoying Edward Furlong) and acts as their protector from the T1000. Robert Patrick plays the T1000, whose liquid metal configuration is a cool (if unbelievable) creation. Patrick is actually pretty good in his limited screen time and definitely exudes menace, but the fear of his character is derived more from his seemingly invincible design (backed up by some incredible, groundbreaking CGI) than the actor himself. In T1, we saw Schwarzenegger's T800 bit by bit lose his ""humanity"" to reveal the creature underneath (with the aid of puppetry and stop-motion animation) and that was a lot scarier.

The T2 supporting cast ranges from very weak (John's foster parents, who weren't even REMOTELY curious as to why a huge German-accented leather-clad biker was looking for John!) to inconsequential (Sarah's Mexican friend that helped hide them out), but not all their fault as they aren't operating with much of a script. Also, I found myself cringing at certain scenes, and for the wrong reasons! A major example would be the poorly executed (no pun intended) ""key"" scene when the heroic trio go after the T800 creator Dyson: When Arnie's T800 strips off the human skin on his robotic arm to prove their story to Dyson, the bug-eyed reactions of Dyson and his wife were way over-the-top. But the worst part of that scene was Sarah's overly melodramatic crisis of conscience about killing Dyson; Hamilton's acting during that scene was really bad. Contrast an ineffectual manipulative ""Hollywood"" scene like this one to the more ""naturalistic"" character reactions in T1, which wasn't made with some studio bigwigs getting in the way of the director's vision. Also, I thought the whole Dyson subplot to be kind of tacked on.

Arnie's one-liners (which shouldn't even really exist in a movie like this) come off as mostly stale due to a painfully weak, by-the-numbers script. I couldn't believe how poor the dialogue was when I saw this again recently! Not really even an attempt at realism or humor. The dialogue serves as filler material to either try to be cute with silly catchphrases (and dated ones at that) or to pontificate unnecessarily about nuclear war and the fate of humanity. T1 didn't have such waste in it, cutting to the chase (literally) and even the expository dialogue and scenes were PART OF the action, rather than being separate from it like in T2.

James Cameron is not really one of my favorite directors (although I think T1 is perhaps the best sci-fi action film of all time), but he did a tremendous job of helping to usher in a new era of special effects with T2 (major reason why I'm at least giving it 3 stars!). The 20-year old effects are still very eye-catching indeed and top even a lot of the current CGI in movies now. But the main problem with the effects is, as previously alluded to, with the logic behind the makeup Patrick's T1000 character. Are we supposed to accept at face value that such an unlikely creation from the not-so-distant future is even possible? Yeah, it's cool, but it's there as simply an excuse for action and to wow us with advanced effects, whereas in T1, Arnie's T800 was an actual CHARACTER! When it comes to CGI vs. character, give me character anyday!",1272672000,,4718,4.722087378640777
2135267,5,B0002WYTWG,"My title is two-fold, because not only do I think 1984's THE TERMINATOR (T1) is the best and undisputed of all the Terminator movies, I also think it's the best and undisputed of James Cameron's films! I really think that after this original classic, Cameron totally lost his ability to tell a solid story and got too caught up in special effects extravaganzas. Don't believe me? Then watch (I mean really WATCH!) the first sequel to T1, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (T2). It has fantastic effects, but ZERO character development or story! It is the template for the typical, mindless summer action movies that come out in drones in today's CGI-laden film world. The characters in T2 are one-dimensional throughout and the dialogue in that movie is inane and borders on atrocious! Cameron got it right with T1.

T1 is an superb amalgamation of several genres working in perfect synergy: science fiction, horror, action, love story, AND speculation! And all this happens in an amazingly short running time, but the film doesn't feel incomplete (T2 is twice as long and feels totally incomplete!). Quite simply, T1 has ""no fat"" on it. Everything seems necessary to propel the plot along.

Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is a wonder to behold to this day! I still don't think enough people appreciate how great it truly is. He is totally convincing as a machine, and nothing to do with the fact that he is an actor of limited range (ok, maybe that's part of it!). But imagine how hard it must be to literally be ""emotionless"", but to react not as a human would, but as a programmed machine would, and he pulled it off. Most other actors that play robots (including the ones in the sequels) tend to play it the same in an all-too obvious, monotone manner, and aren't able to hide human characteristics.

The other two main performances should not be overlooked either. Both Michael Biehn (as futuristic rebel soldier Kyle Reese) and Linda Hamilton (as Sarah Connor future mother of resistance leader John Connor) deliver knockout performances as well. The actors really ""sell"" the movie and lift it to a higher level than lesser or miscast actors would have.

T1's main draw is it's claustropobic, unsettling, atmospheric, noirish tone and feel throughout, thanks in large part to the memorable beating, bouncing score that accompanies the Terminator whenever he shows up. The film's first big set piece is at the aptly named Tech Noir dance club and that scene signifies the entire mood of T1. Then the iconic ""I'll be back"" police station showdown puts the icing on the cake! Set mostly at night, the underlying theme of T1 is doom, dread, and hopelessness, yet the film never bores as it moves at a fast pace, has gritty dialogue, strong characters, and a pulse-pounding climax.

2135282,5,B0002WYTWG,"I got blasted for pretty much panning Cameron's 1984 `The Terminator'.  I was crucified to put it nicely.  It's funny, because I still feel the same way.  It's a film that just doesn't hold up well as the years have come and gone.  Cameron's 1991 sequel, a film that I nearly didn't see because of my feelings on the '84 film, is drastically different.  Thanks to recommendations from friends I finally took the time to check this one out, and I have to say that it totally blows the first film out of the water in ALL AREAS.  You see, I attacked `The Terminator', not only for its graphics (yes, they were great for the time and paved the way, but the don't impress now, at all) but also for the density of the story and the acting (I over praised Hamilton; definitely reaching for something to praise).

I don't know if I have enough praise for this film though.

The acting (even from the Schwarzenegger) is leaps and bounds better than the '84 film (even if young Furlong has his moments of cringe inducing overacting) and the graphics are nearly as good as things we see today (I prefer these graphics to Cameron's overrated mess of an `Avatar'), but it is the depth of story that really impresses me the most here.  This film doesn't feel like your average action junkie film.  It has a beating heart, and while the whole idea of man being mans worst enemy has been explored many times (two years before this film Cameron expressed similar feelings in `The Abyss'), it is a subject that lends itself to many variations and thus has a long shelf life.

The film picks up YEARS after the first left off.  Sarah has gone crazy (or so the government would have you believe) and has been locked up.  Her son, John, is living with neglectful (or maybe they are just tired) foster parents.  The Terminator returns, except this time he is not the savage killer he was initially.  In the future, John has rewired him to be his protector, and he ventures to rescue John from an advanced killing machine sent to destroy him.

Madness ensues.

The underlying morale of violence and it's claws in humanity are embellished in many ways, from the overlaying plot regarding the future and the machines, to John's own views of The Terminator's knack for killing to his simple yet powerful observation at a gas station (""we're not going to make it, are we?"").  The film really understands how to rise above its own genre, creating something truly powerful within all the explosions and bloodshed.

I kind of attacked Arnold for his lack of acting skills, and while some protested that that was the way he was supposed to play it, I still kind his performance in the first film to be rather ridiculous (but a lot of that was the script).  It's amazing what a little brain power can pull off.  With the advanced script work, this particular performance reaches all new heights.  Arnold, while still awkward and unintentionally comical, carries a human heart here, slowly learning how to adjust to the human world.  Robert Patrick makes a better villain than Arnold (and thus Arnold makes a much better `protector' than `terminator').  He has the suave viciousness needed to make him less robotic (he is an advanced model).  I mentioned already that Furlong has his moments of `ouch', but he also has many moments that work.  He is surely the films weakest link, but I won't fault him too much.  He works (and his work in 1998's `American History X' is sheer genius and proves that he had the talent).

Linda Hamilton is a goddess here.  She grapples EVERYTHING to perfection.  I don't truly understand why so many consider her a supporting actress here though.  Some may argue that the machines (the terminators) are the leading characters, but that's like saying Shia LaBeouf is supporting in `Transformers' because the main characters are the transformers.  Anyways, no matter where you put her, she deserves to be somewhere.  I didn't think that anyone could knock the `Thelma and Louise' ladies from the top of my ballot, but Hamilton has done it.  The way she balances the macho with the insane with the tenderness is just astonishing.  She never flinches in her delivery, proving to transcend the genre and just deliver brilliance.

This may be taking a lot of you by surprise (it has me) but I tend to believe this may be the perfect action film and surely one of the best ever made.  With heart, soul and a TON of fantastic action sequences (the initial chase scene, through the mall, on the street, OMG), this film is a must see, not just for the action junkie, but for the film lover in us all!",1266192000,,4590,4.615289765721331

2135290,4,B0002WYTWG,"SKYNET EDITION

This movie is unbelievably amazing on Blu-ray disc.  The picture quality and sound quality is superb and for it's age, I do  not think this movie could possibly look any better.  The skynet edition is interesting.  We get 3 versions of the film.  The theatrical, director's cut, and the extended director's cut which is un-lockable with a password and has an alternate ending.  The alternate ending can also be watched separately in the special features so I would recommend watching the regular director's cut since the alternate ending in the extended is not linear with the rest of the franchise and it's sequels.  Although the ending is interesting and worth a look.  As far as special features go, there are not as many as the ultimate edition dvd had but there are still many including BD live features that I have not had the chance to check out yet as I do not have my bluray player hooked up online.

I do have some cons with the features.  Many of the features like the behind the scenes stuff are in a picture-in-picture format.  This means you have to be watching the film to view these.  While this is an interesting take on commentary because we not only hear them talking about it, we actually see it, this is not something that appeals to me.  I have never been a commentary guy.  I rarely listen to commentaries and for me to have to watch the whole movie just to watch some behind the scenes stuff does not appeal to me.  Some people might feel the exact opposite.  I personally would rather have a behind the scenes featurette.  The games are also played while the film is playing.  As a matter of fact pretty much all the special features require you to watch the film.  This is why it is over 8 hours worth of special features, because you have to literally watch the film 4 times with each feature turned on.  I do not know what the BD live features are, but I hope to get connected soon to find out.

Another issue I have with this disc is the load time.  It takes several minutes to get to a screen that says you are not connected to skynet, you may watch this disc without being connected click here to do so...  something to that effect.  You then have to click that you want to watch the film.  When that part comes on, I go make some popcorn or something because the screen is blank for at least 5 minutes.  It is slightly annoying and I have to really want to watch the movie to go through that ordeal which makes the skynet edition slightly less appealing.  However every player is different and some work much faster.  Also I do not know if hooking it up online would help.  At least it wouldn't be searching for skynet so it is a possibility.

Even with the extremely long load times I recommend this blu-ray because it is the best version of T2 available.  T2 isn't a movie you throw on to pass the time, you put it on to experience.  Throw it in, let it load and go make some popcorn.  By the time your done the menus will be loaded and you can pick 1 of 3 different versions to watch.  Sit back and enjoy T2 in 1080p HD with complete master audio!  It doesn't get any better than this!

2135296,5,B0002WYTWG,"Well, the movie itself is spectacular. Effects, acting, directing, all are top notch. So, let's look at the Blu-ray itself.

The Sony Blu-ray player that I watched the movie on is not connected to the internet (or, if it matters, never has been connected). So, after I put the disc in, it took a minute or so before it told me that there is no internet connection. From the choices such as 'retry' or 'cancel' I pressed cancel. It took maybe about 5 minutes or so to load the disc. Not a problem, I was there to enjoy the movie and not to accomplish a timed race. After it loaded, all of the menus were fine. It was easy to navigate, no problems whatsoever.

There are 3 versions of the movie on the disc. Original theatrical, extended (with, if I remember correctly, extra 15 minutes or so) and the last one is Director's cut, I guess, which, on top of the extended version adds extra 5 minutes or so. That's the one that I chose. Like many wrote here, the CODE IS 82997. The movie played perfectly fine.

Quality was absolutely excellent, both audio and video. Amazing restoration! If you are thinking about the DVD, here is the link to a much more specific video/audio/bonus material review - highdefdigest[dot]com and search for this movie.

There are plenty of bonus material as well, for none of which you need an internet connection. Bonus material includes:
*Audio Commentaries
*Deleted Scenes
*Theatrical Trailers
Also there are 8! interactive modes, which are played within the movie itself, so, I guess if you want to see/hear all of them you would have to watch movie 8 times. Modes include picture-in-picture storyboards, scripts, trivia, and how its made type of things. Fun to watch. If you really think about it, it's not like you're re-watching the movie over and over again, because each time you are focused mostly on the interactive mode of your choice, instead of the movie. Also, you can skip from one to the next, so you don't have to watch the movie again and again, if you don't want to.

For more info about the DVD, such as audio/video quality, special features explanation and more, go to highdefdigest[dot]com

Like I said, movies itself (any of the 3 versions), bonus material, and interactive modes DO NOT REQUIRE an internet connection. Also, don't let few minute wait at the beginning to discourage you. Make sure, however, that your Blu-ray player is a Profile 2.0, either by just connecting it to download an update, or doing it from disk, manually.",1262736000,,2484,4.698850574712644

2135304,4,B0002WYTWG,"I decided to ignore the warnings about this movie only playing on updated, internet connected players and I'm glad I did. I just played this on my $98 Magnavox Nb530mgx profile 1.1 player, and....""no problemo"".

Terminator 2: Skynet Edition, has a notorious reputation for not working on some newer, more expensive, internet capable Blu Ray players. Many have said it'll only work on a profile 2.0 player or that you need a code for a profile 1.0 player. The Nb530mgx is a profile 1.1 player without a internet connection and it booted up and played just fine. No firmware update or code needed. It took a couple minutes to pull up a message stating that it knows I don't have a profile 2.0 that it's not connected to the internet. That I should get one to take advantage of all the features but that it'll load up anyway. It took another minute and filled in 3 triangles on the same screen and I was at the main menu. I went straight to the extended version, pressed play and it started up as normal. I recommend for those that have it or will buy it, just be patient and let it load up. If it did for mine, I don't see why it won't for yours.

There's not much I can say about T2 that hasn't been said 1000 times. It's a classic, still holds up very well, one of Arnolds and James Camerons best movies, good effects, good action scenes and so on and so on. It's all true. You can watch it again and again and it's always good.

I found the picture quality to be slightly better than the last T2 Blu Ray, which was disappointingly identical to my upconverted T2: Extreme DVD (which is still a very good version). I wasn't expecting a big leap here so that's fine. It's still very clean and close up shots are nicely detailed. It just doesn't pop like newer transfers.

It's the audio that really sells this one with a pleasing improvement over the previous version by providing the lossless, 6.1 DTS-HD audio. For those with capable receivers, it's well worth the double dip.

T2: Skynet Edition is definitley THE best T2 to get for the audio and video. I'm sure that many will love the extras and internet enabled features as well. For me, I just want to enjoy it in it's best possible audio and video available and I did and know I will continue to in the future. T2 is a fun film and Amazon has frequently offered the Skynet Edition for $11.99 which is an incredible offer. For those interested, go for it. Although there's no guarantee it'll work in your player, for $11.99, it's worth the risk. Highly recommended.",1261526400,,2520,4.422413793103448

2135306,5,B0002WYTWG,"I went back and watched the original Terminator film before I sat down to watch this slick and entertaining sequel. While the original is darker and gritty, the sequel is much more tongue and cheek. Arnold returns as the iconic cyborg, but this time he's the good guy! Having a huge budget increase this film is much bigger with groundbreaking FX(for the time). One could argue that this is a ""Hollywood"" sequel that sold out, but I think what Cameron did with the sequel is pay respect to the original film and do a lot of the things he wanted to do the first time around, but couldn't because of budget restraints.

What I love about the sequel is that the characters are much more developed and I guess that is the trade off for not being as intense as the original. This time there's a new metallic menace played wickedly cold by Robert Patrick. It would have been nice to have Lance Henriksen in this role as he was Cameron's first choice for the original Terminator, but Patrick's sleek morphing shapeshifter is a perfect counterpart to Arnold's bulky brute. The Extreme edition which I'm reviewing is disappointing as it doesn't have that much in the way of extras considering it's a two disc set unless your counting the material that can only be viewed on a computer!

2135316,5,B0002WYTWG,"THE MOVIE: 5/5
Terminator (or The Terminator, if you prefer) is and always will be an excellent movie. It expertly combines the two genres of science fiction and action. This movie was in my opinion James Cameron's break-through movie. After this, he made classic movies such as Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, and of course, Titanic. Terminator truly is a modern classic. It's one of those relatively low budget movies that made it big. You don't need to take my word of it: other reviewers have given it 5 out of 5 stars.

THE DVD RELEASE VS THE BLU-RAY RELEASE
The first DVD release of Terminator was released in the late 1990s. Even though it was widescreen, unfortunately it was non-anamorphic, which can look terrible on a modern widescreen TV (as it only fills the center of the screen and leaves 4 black bars). The audio was the original mono soundtrack, with all its nostalgic 1980s sounding music and dialogue that sounds... somewhat low quality (which was commonplace for a sci-fi B-movie) It's definitely a nostalgic experience in sound.

Recently, I acquired the Blu-Ray of the Terminator. The picture quality was amazing compared to the first DVD. It was anamorphic widescreen and looks nice on a widescreen TV; however, it still isn't quite up to normal HD standards since it was shot on low-quality film. Still, it was a great video improvement. When I first watched it, the audio bugged me, and I didn't quite know why. It turned out that the Blu-Ray had used the 5.1 remix of the sound. It added new sound effects and made the dialogue sound normal. The audio sounded modern, completely different from the nostalgic B-movie sound. Now, call me funny, but I didn't like it. I missed the old, mono quality audio with the cheesy 1980s sound effects that had been replaced with regular, sounding audio and improved sound effects. In my opinion, it took away the warm B-movie feeling that the first DVD had. To top it all off, I found that the Blu-Ray didn't include the original mono soundtrack.

The average viewer might like the Blu-Ray as it looks modern and sounds technically better. Others, like me, might love that warm, 1980s nostalgic experience of the DVD. The choice is yours.",1255737600,,2202,4.7894736842105265
2135317,2,B0002WYTWG,"This is a great movie, however blu ray shows a lower then expected resolution and it feels - especially in the opening scene like the studio did not try and remaster the negatives so you see all these old artifacts showing up on the film.

The only negative critique I've ever had about the film is the scene where Arnold removes the eye, and his face clearly looks like a mask.
The deleted scenes on the disk are fun to watch but they are not re-edited into the film as they did in Aliens. I wish they had done that or given you the option too, because I really enjoyed it that way. Most of the scenes were taken out for timing or pacing and otherwise could have been left in.

2135328,1,B0002WYTWG,"The movie, well, it's still great. This commentary is strictly on the BluRay version.

Extras: Minimal

Video Quality: Terrible. It looks like an old, damaged, partially burned film was used as the master. There are scratches, black marks - even jitters. More like a drive-in movie that was played 100 times too many. All that was redone was some of the text. The classic scene when Arnold stands up - in the left portion of the screen is this dancing black burn/scrape the size of a large rat moving up and down the screen.  When Kyle lands in the alley, it looks like there are coffee grounds on the lens.  It's that bad - seriously.  The only part (and I do mean part) that anyone took time on was Arnold's front nude scene when he walked towards the punks, seeking clothing. You clearly see said ""part"" dangling and bobbing. Nuf' said.

The opening menu reminded me of some cheesy fan website. The button audio was 10x louder than the background audio. Each time I arrowed up or down, I thought I'd blow a speaker. Even the rendering was poor - too few frames, so it's jittery.  I picture someone at the studio yelling ""Hey, I need an intern to learn BluRay mastering - here's some software, a video camera, some film and the keys to the screening room. Do me proud.""

DVD quality: Well, the menu froze several times for around two seconds. The opening titles froze for a second.  The movie froze several times for a second or two.  I have a new, version 2 BluRay player and around 20 BluRay movies. This is the ONLY one this has happened on. This is a minimal quality, no frills (not even a one page insert), low-budget production.  To be honest, I think my DVD version is better (except for the audio.)

Audio: Phenomenal. True 5.1 - the rumbles shake the rafters, gunfire and plasma rifle lovers can rejoice.  Arnold's stoic accent thunders.

2135336,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is a well-known franchise that has action and science fiction combined into a blender. The first is a great start in the franchise. Directed by James Cameron who also directed the highest-grossing film of all time, Titanic and co-wrote Rambo: First Blood part II alongside Sylvester Stallone. Let's begin the review. The film begins in 2029 when terminator cyborgs created by a super computer Skynet took over Earth and unleashed nuclear warheads on the world and killed 3/5 of the human population. The survivors and Skynet engage into a world war to settle the deed to Earth. The leader of the resistance being John Connor. Skynet sends a disguised Terminator (Arnold Schwarznegger) to 1984 to assassinate John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) so that John would cease to exist and give Skynet an advantage. John discovers this and sends another resistance fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah. Kyle tells Sarah about Judgment Day and the future war between humanity and Skynet. The Terminator tries to look for which woman with the name Sarah Connor to kill, but doesn't know the target's middle name, so he resorts to killing every one of them just in case. He eventually found the right one with Kyle and begins a battle that would continue throughout the rest of the film. Kyle and Sarah conceive the future John during their only night together at a motel.  In the final showdown at the factory, Kyle sacrifices himself to put the Terminator at a legless disadvantage. Sarah crushes the living daylights out of the Terminator in the end. Some time later, it shows the now-pregnant Sarah traveling to a new town. The visual effects were so real, the acting was well-done, and the storyline is so convincing you would want to see it. There are so far three sequels that eventually followed. Judgment Day is a possible candidate for best sequel (like Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and The Dark Knight, for example), and best film in the action/science fiction genre. Rise of the Machines was where the series went downhill when James Cameron dropped out. I have not seen Salvation yet. I would recommend getting the first two for your collection, but unless you are a true fan of the series, please avoid the mediocre third.",1250121600,,2320,4.858585858585859

I put in my previous Terminater DVD, and I couldn't believe it! The picture was better on the DVD, and it had way more special features too! Even though I paid fifteen dollars for it for the new edition, I STILL FEEL RIPPPED OFF!!!!!!

2135341,4,B0002WYTWG,"Looking around, it seems that people like this movie better than the first Terminator. I can't say I agree.

The second movie does have things going for it. The special effects are great, and have held up pretty well. Linda Hamilton gets to play a desperate brain case, and really threw herself into the role. But I don't think Arnold is quite as convincing as a hero, not after his great, soulless, menacingly evil role in the first movie. (Insert your own joke about California, here). And the foul mouthed little punk - sorry, the future savior of mankind - was very irritating, most of the time he was on screen.

And ignoring the paradoxes (which are half the plot), would you really sent a blithely homicidal robot back to be controlled by a nasty little criminal punk of a 10 year old? You're gambling your own existence (and other peoples') on this little wacko's whims. It all gets several points for the coolness of having a kid with his very own Mega Robot of Death, but it really snapped suspension of disbelief for me. Unlike the first movie, you have to park your brain somewhere to enjoy this one. But it does repay you with a nice ride, after that.",1247529600,,1164,4.511848341232228

2135352,4,B0002WYTWG,"This ""Skynet Edition"" of T2 is the best looking release of T2 to date. The picture is sharp and detailed. It's not overly grainy, nor does it look like the grain has been reduced too much.

I can't judge the audio from a home-theater buff's perspective, as my only audio source is the TV's built-in speakers, but it sounds great on my TV. The main uncompressed audio track has a very wide dynamic range...sometimes too wide, actually. I have to turn the sound up quite a bit to hear dialogue clearly, then I'm blown away by the action scenes which are way too loud. This might not be as much of an issue for those with better audio systems though.

The only gripe I have about this disc is the insanely slow loading times. I have a pretty new Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-Ray player and the disc takes 2-3 minutes to load initially. Once the main menu has loaded, you can watch the film and special features easily, but if you want to watch with any of the informational overlays (script, production notes, storyboards, etc.) in the ""interactive mode"" then you have to wait again as the interactive mode loads. Just plan on taking a bathroom break or something after you pop the disc in while you wait for it to load.

The BD-Live feature is, I think, a big plus on this disc. Several ""making-of"" type features that were on previous releases of T2 can be downloaded via the BD-Live interface. So even though you don't own every previous DVD release of the film, you can still watch the special features that came with them. There are some other BD-Live features which I haven't tried, such as an interactive chess game of some sort.

If you haven't picked up T2 on Blu-Ray, this is definitely the one to get. Great picture, great sound, and good special features make this worth the price you pay for it, as long as you don't mind the slow loading times.",1246233600,,1848,4.491071428571429

1.) For a movie made in 1991, the transfer is flawless. It looks a lot better than the previous blu ray version.
2.) The sound is amazing! (Dolby 6.1) The fact that they included a headphones sound option is fantastic! I watched it once with my Bose Quite Comfort 2 headphones, and it blew me away how awesome it was!!!!
3.) They have most of the features (all of the good ones at least) from the last two versions of the movie on DVD.
4.) We have all three versions of the movie and I love the extended special edition version the best. A must watch.

The sound alone is worth the price.

The movie is one of the sci-fi greats of all time, but the technology is getting a bit old. When I first saw the bullet impact scenes, I thought, wow, how cool is that? Now I see just a bunch of metal buttons on the T2.

The sound and visual impact of the movie is terrific, but skip this version. It's too fussy. It shouldn't have to rely on Internet connectivity to work.",1245974400,,649,4.225806451612903

2135359,5,B0002WYTWG,"The original Terminator was something very special and was the film that kick started the career of one of the biggest action movie stars in history. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the original Terminator was the definitive bad guy; violent, emotionless and unstoppable. That same character returned for the sequel, but this time he joined the defending team and was sent back by future John Connor to protect the past John Connor. Arnold is still a T-101 but was reprogrammed by future Connor to fight on the human's side, and rather than having a human enemy, the story is very much Terminator vs. More advanced Terminator.

Judgement Day focuses around a 10 year old John Connor whose mother, Sarah has been put in a mental institute for telling the stories of the original Terminator assassination attempt and John is a rebel living in a foster home. Another Terminator has been sent back to kill the future leader of the human resistance, now a much more powerful enemy, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) which is a machine that is made almost entirely of liquid metal. It can morph itself to look exactly like anything it touches and mould parts of its body to sharp objects to assassinate those who get in its way. As the protector, a reprogrammed T-101 (Arnold) is sent back to protect the young rebel.

Taking the guise of a police officer, the T-1000 goes on a rapid search for John and comes very close to catching him, but at the right moment is found by the T-101 and has the best man (or machine) for the job as his protector. Once John becomes aware of his possible future, he and the T-101 embark on a journey to not only break Sarah Connor out of the mental institute, but to destroy Skynet and prevent Judgement Day and the rise of the machines. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now a tough woman who appears tougher than the T-101 and becomes the leader of the attack on Skynet.

The original Terminator movie at the time was considered really hard to top as at the time of the sequels release, the original had gained a massive cult status. Nobody really considered just how good this film would be and it came along at a time when Arnold was developing his career as a diverse actor, whilst still remaining loyal to the action movie genre. Also, hot off the cusp of the massive film, The Predator, there was no doubting there would be more interest in this solely because of Schwarzenegger's involvement. Of course, a massive budget of $102 million and the involvement of Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't necessarily make a good film. What made this great was its pace, atmosphere, acting, action, script and special effects all masterfully combined to create what was undoubtedly the film of that year.

The clarity of the special effects of the time was revolutionary, much like the special effects exhibited in the first Terminator. They managed to make the T-1000 machine utterly believable in its presence and ability to mould itself and transform at will as we were treated to particular moments in which it did just that. Most impressive was its rising from the mental hospital floor behind one of the guards, only to kill him and take his form. The makeup of the damage taken by the T-101 was also very well done and really did make it believable that Arnold was possibly really a machine underneath that masculine exterior.

Linda Hamilton is triumphant in this role and a complete re-imagining of the character we know from the first film. The Sarah Connor from this movie is vociferously brutish in her demeanour and is clearly a woman who has experienced something very traumatic that has meant she needed to lose the core emotions that weakened her in order to survive. Edward Furlong as the main protagonist for the entire Terminator story arch displayed a perfect character and the rebellious kid attitude was performed really well by him. It almost makes me wonder what the hell those involved in the third Terminator movie were thinking by not casting him in the lead role once more.

I honestly adore this film as it manages to become unconsciously deep and expressing of the idea to remain emotionally close whilst at the same time remaining strong in your convictions. It was well deserving of the awards it won at the time and it's quite sad to know that any future Terminator movies will not pale in comparison to the brilliance of Terminator 2.

This is about video and audio quality the way a BLU RAY movie should be.  The video quality is terrible; audio was nominal at best.  In fact, the DVD version on a standard DVD player and tube TV looks better.  It reminded me of how the VHS version looked after I bought my first DVD player.  I got it for $13 at BestBuy but I don't even think it was worth even that.  Do not buy this; keep or buy the DVD version.",1245628800,,557,3.963963963963964
2135362,4,B0002WYTWG,"I was a little concerned after reading the bad reviews this disc is getting due to non-compatibility with some BD players but I had no such trouble on my DMP-BD35 2.0 compliant player. I updated the player's firmware (version 1.9), just in case, but don't have it connected via broadband and didn't get a chance to test any of the ""on-line"" content. And contrary to some reviews YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HOOKED UP TO THE INTERNET TO PLAY THE MOVIE!

Once I opened the packaging and popped the disc into the player it took less than a minute for the ""Skynet is unable to connect to the internet"" message to appear and you hit ""Cancel"" (if you aren't wired). Another minute and the ""Mainframe Accessing"" animation starts followed by the main menus about a minute and a half later. Once I selected the version 30 seconds passed followed by the obligatory series of splashes and logos, annoying but not much different than most other discs these days. The movie started a few minutes later. So the total time lapse from the moment the disc player tray disappeared to the movie actually beginning (credits and music) was about 6 minutes. A long wait by most Blu-ray standards but certainly not the horror that I've heard some complain about (20 minutes plus!?). The menus too are a bit sluggish but not overwhelmingly so.

The video quality is outstanding if a bit soft (not too unusual for a movie of this age) but the sound is AMAZING! This you really must experience with a 5.1/7.1 surround system to get the full effect this film was made to convey. I've owned the T2 laserdisc for years and it remains superior to any DVD version I've seen but this Blu-ray finally trumps it. 4 Stars for the relatively long wait to get to the feature and the slightly sluggish menus but the 'Skynet Edition' is a winner for those with 2.0 compliant BD players.",1245283200,,1840,4.572727272727272

2135367,2,B0002WYTWG,"The image and sound quality on this new Blu-Ray edition are fine according to my eyes and ears, so I'm rating it two stars despite the temptation to drop to one because of the irritation I experience whenever I put the disc into my player.

Basically, this T2 release is a perfect example of how a Blu-Ray disc's UI can be badly designed and authored. I'm not even talking about the menus themselves (though they are sluggish and some of the interactivity options are confusingly presented); I'm talking about the amount of time one has to wait before even getting to the menus.

On my player (Panasonic DMP-BD50K with the v1.9 firmware from 10 June 2009 - the most recent version at time of writing), here's how the schedule goes when this disc is inserted, with times given in minutes and seconds:

0:00 - Press ""Play"".
0:44 - Player's front panel shows its first timestamp (0:00).
1:21 - Player starts a network connection.
1:45 - First appearance of any graphic on screen (a progress meter for the network connection).
4:16 - The ""Skynet"" UI comes up and shows me my zip code and the fricking *weather* in my area (because I apparently need to be informed of these things in order to watch the film) and then waits for me to press ""Continue"" before it'll do anything else.
5:16 - The first of several studio logos plays.
5:59 - ""Skynet mainframe accessing"" message appears on screen, telling me that because my player is BD-Live 2.0 compliant, the disc is downloading data for the menus (the full-motion clips, maybe?).
7:00 - The main menu finally appears and is accessible.

Seven minutes of startup time. And this was a good run, too; I'd started timing a previous run in the week of the disc's release, but gave up after *twenty-five* minutes of staring at the ""Skynet"" graphic and waiting for the network download to complete.

Now, my network connection isn't bad - I get firmware updates for my player without any difficulties. But even if it were that, this stinker of a UI violates two principles which I think are important for Blu-Ray authors:

(1) It wastes time and bandwidth downloading useless and peripheral information, with no chance for the user to opt out short of disabling the network connection on the player ahead of time. When I put a disc in my player, it's because I want to watch the film on that disc, as hard as that may be for the T2 disc author to believe. If I want to find my zip code, I'll remember it (or look it up on my mail or the USPS web site); if I want to know what the current weather is like in my region, I'll poke my head outside. This is unforgivable.

(2) It won't finish loading on its own: unless I press ""Continue"" after the ""Skynet"" zip-code/weather screen, it'll just stay there. (And disabling the network on the player in advance, while it does save some start-up time, leaves me with the same problem: in this case, the UI notes that no connection is available and then waits for me to confirm.) It's bad enough that the disc takes so long to load, but making me spend that time waiting at the player to click a confirmation button - as opposed to letting me go and use the time elsewhere - strikes me as very poor design. Discs should load all the way to the main menu before requiring user interaction.

This is the first time I've been tempted to write to a studio (Lionsgate) and ask them to re-author a disc with features omitted. As noted above, I'm very happy with the presentation of the film: I just wish I could extract it from this awful, irritating disc UI and save myself some time and frustration.",1244937600,,3572,4.510046367851623

Not too bad at all. I was a bit concerned after reading some alarming reviews quoting up to 20 minute wait times.

I will point out that I have the latest firmware (released 1/09) installed for this model via Sony's great support website. All that is required with any company's blu-ray firmware is to download the file and burn it to CD-R as instructed.

After loading the disc in the tray, I pressed nothing.  Just let it load without pressing anything.  The message about a blu-ray profile 1.x player with no internet connection comes up for about 2 minutes.

As far as the picture quality, it is DEFINITELY MUCH CLEARER AND SHARPER than the original blu-ray release! I'm a picky videophile viewing on a 46"" Sony flat LCD.  If I thought the picture was sub par I would say as much.  There is a slightly soft look which undoubtedly helps hide film stock grain. The picture is so detailed that even the slightest differences is camera focus are immediately obvious. The original 2006 release was HORRID!  I couldn't believe it was called a blu-ray movie.  In fact my upscaled T-2 DVD looked pretty much the same or better.  It was hammered with bad reviews. Now I see that the original blu-ray and its reviews on not even listed on Amazon.

2135373,1,B0002WYTWG,"Okay, everyone knows this movie. One of the greatest of all time and it set the standard for this type of movie until The Matrix came out. Still one the very best and I watch it often.

Now, to this particular disk: Skynet BluRay Version. I bought our bluray player (Sony BDP-BX1) just 3 months ago, so I didn't think we'd have any problems.

However:

1. You MUST have internet access hooked up to your bluray player. I had to go out and buy a 50' lan cable just so I could reach from the home office to the TV room. And it has to be plugged in to watch the movie. Unless your TV or HT room has internet access, you'll need a LAN cable laying on the floor during your movie watching. (and it cost me $22 for the cable. More than the movie.)

2. You should have an extra memory stick plugged in to access some of the features. It told me I needed at least 10.5meg. I didn't plug it in, just skipped that part.

3. It takes FOREVER to load. I'm talking a good 15-20 minutes from the time you put the disk in untill you see the first scene of the movie. I am not exaggerating.

Also, I had to UPGRADE my brand new Sony BD player. It would not run at all until I ran the update. That itself took about 25 minutes. But of course it's a one time deal.

Also, there is very little help or information on how to access the various parts of the disk. I still have not done anything but watch the movie one time. It was so frustrating, I just wanted to get away from it.

The movie is great, but really I would not have bought it knowing all that I do now. If you just want to watch the movie and don't want to wait 20 minutes to start watching and you don't need all the other junk that goes with it, (which you have to have internet access and a LAN enabled player, plus a memory stick plugged in) skip this version.

2135374,4,B0002WYTWG,"This is a review about the blu-ray version of The Terminator:

I've read here that some of you think the upgrade to The Terminator on blu-ray isn't worth the double-dipping. I don't know because I never got around to owning the standard edition so I have nothing to compare it to.

With that said, I can see where a few of you may have a point concerning the blu-ray transfer; sure it isn't mind-boggling in any way, and it's certainly not going to win any awards for being ""reference quality"" in terms of high def, but the fact that it has been encoded in 1080p speaks for itself.

In fact, I read that Sony did some extensive noise reduction on this print. So, it has to be better than the DVD. Right? I mean, what the hell do you expect Sony to do? You have to consider that they're working with source materials that are not so pristine, not to mention how the the film was shot and the stock they used, etc.

If you complainers want the best, then send off an e-mail to Criterion Studios and ask them to strike a new master. I'm sure it'll look the best it's ever going to at a forty dollar retail price.

Good luck with that.",1244332800,,1131,4.241860465116279
2135375,5,B0002WYTWG,"After sitting through the truly horrible, screeching, incomprehensible mess known as ""Terminator Salvation"" last night, I came straight home and put in this fabulous, never boring masterpiece and wondered anew at how it holds up after nearly 30 years. while this latest sequel fails on almost every level, the original continues to thrill, delight and fascinate. The story itself is masterful: it's basically that of an evil force that comes to destroy good until the person is rescued by a hero. Linda Hamilton is fantastic and she'll always be known as the original Sarah Connor.

The others are equally dynamic but its the brilliant way that director James Cameron keeps his story simple, uncluttered and just delivers a breathless race of hero and heroine trying to escape an unstoppable evil. The musical score by Brad Fiedel adds immensely to the power of the film. The final sequence of Sarah Connor riding off toward a horion filled with storm clouds gives this masterpiece the perfect ending.

You sense that she knows the battle she faces and that she'll survive.

The tragedy of all great franchises is that no sequel or prequel can ever measure up to the original that inspired the spin-offs.  After this latest sequel nightmare--""Terminator Salvation""--audiences like me will return to the original to be really entertained and thrilled. But leave it to the moneymen--they'll keep remaking and giving us sequels and prequels until the last drop is squeezed dry.

At least we'll always have James Cameron, Arnold, Linda and Michael Biehn to keep showing us what a true masterpiece is.",1244332800,,1596,5.076335877862595

Yes on the profile 2.0 it wants to connect to the Internet buy you just hit cancel and it continues to load.

Yes it does take about 40 seconds to load but the sound and picture are awesome!!

I have seen this movie so many times and i still have not gotten tired of it. Terminator 2 has already been released on dvd and i have to say that if you are a huge terminator fan you should buy the first one that came out it has so much detail and information about the making of the movie that it will blow you away. This re-release is okay i guess it has a couple more special features that are worth a watch. But the real reason that this dvd was released again was for the sound and picture improvements. Let me warm you that you should have a fancy home theater to notice these improvements or else you won't really notice a change in picture or sound.

2135379,3,B0002WYTWG,"I seriously am considering lowering the rating right now, but ah what the hell.

This is one of my favorite movies of all time, so I was excited about buying this release because it was great to finally have T2 on Blu-Ray. At HMV, I found two Blu-Ray editions- the original Blu-Ray release and this. With this having more extras and having a better transfers (according to source), I picked this one up.

I popped in the disc, expecting it to be like what others had bitched about, and it worked perfectly. I have an LG BDP300. So anyways, after 30 seconds of a blank screen, I get this message saying that Skynet ""does not recognize the network connection"". I chose ""cancel"", knowing my Blu-Ray player does not connect to the internet. Then during the loading screen (which lasted for at least a minute), it said that there was no connection and that it would load with a full menu.

It really pisses me off that they'd do this. All I ask is just for a proper release and not try to be all cool with this ""skynet"" stuff. I mean, if anything I bought it for the fact that it was the movie in Blu-Ray, and that'd be effing awesome.

The menu, whilst looking cool, is slow, clunky, and almost not responsive. You'd select something, and then it would take 10 seconds to show. I thought it was just my player, but no, other reviewers are saying the same thing. The popup menu is no different.

By the way, if anyone's wondering, yes I did figure out the password to watch the director's cut (another fail- WHY do we have to put in some stupid password just to watch the clearly superior cut of the film?). Those who are wondering, it's 82997.

When you start playing either version of the movie, you get the Lionsgate splash screen which you can NOT skip, the DTS HD Audio screen, the THX screen, then the StudioCanal screen which you also cannot skip. This is annoying, I just wanna see the movie, mmmkay???

The picture looks great, and was worth the purchase alone. This is probably the best transfer of T2 we'll ever get. The sound is explosive too- if there's such thing as an eargasm, then fast forward to the finale in the steel mill and you'll have one. It has to be heard. The director's cut is well restored here. Nothing has been tampered with, as well as they added in an extra set of credits showing credit for the Director's cut.

The extras were fun too. I loved the in-movie experience, as well as all the games and gizmos, especially the Picture-in-Picture feature. Just excellent. There's lots of commentaries, including the one with 26 cast members- that one is fun, hilarious, and cool. But that said, why do I even need to connect the thing to the damn internet just to be able to access some special features?

So if you want extras, and a good transfer, I guess buy this release. But wait until Lionsgate corrects this release, which hopefully they do. If it just so happens they do, I'll upgrade for sure, but right now, I'm scratching my head over this clunky and unorganized mess of a Blu-Ray release. I guess I'll keep it for now thought, because this is a movie I can watch again and again.",1243900800,,3115,4.450877192982456

2135383,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator series is one of the greatest science fiction franchises of all time. My favorite is Judgment Day, but the original is also great and I am not so sure about Rise of the Machines. The extended edition of this entry contained a lot of never-before-seen footage that helped it feel more complete. Arnold Schwarznegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their respective roles of the T-800 and Sarah Connor with a cameo of Michael Bhien as Kyle Reese in a deleted dream sequence, with newcomers like Robert Patrick as T-1000 and Edward Furlong as the adolescent John Connor. The action was exciting, the storyline was worthy of picking up where its predecessor left off, and the acting was well-rehearsed. The visual effects were so real. It didn't use CGI much, mostly miniatures, makeup, and anamatronics. The CGI was only used for the T-1000 shape shifting parts, the right way, sparingly and hardly noticeable. Abusing CGI for living characters makes it look fake. The plot is where Skynet tries again to kill John Connor in the past and sends the T-1000 to achieve this goal, and the future Connor sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self. It shows John in foster care after his mother Sarah ended up in a mental institution when she tried to tell authorities about Judgment Day and thought she was a psycho. At the mall, John and his friend were attacked by the T-1000 and the T-800 comes to the rescue. John teaches him about human characteristics, such as speech, like Chill out, Hasta-la-vista, baby, no problemo, etc. John also explained why killing is wrong. It is because we have feelings. Together, they help Sarah escape from the hospital and the trio goes to stop Skynet. This was a great action flick that will keep you entertained for hours, now with all these extras, and an extended version that includes deleted scenes to help the film feel more complete. Too bad the the original version on this DVD can only be played on a P.C. If you want to play the original version on T.V., please get the original DVD revision as well.

Edit: I just saw Rise of the Machines more clearly with a friend, and we both thought that was where the franchise hit mediocrity without James Cameron. I will give in-depth reviews of that entry and the original soon.",1243728000,,2282,4.733668341708543
2135384,5,B0002WYTWG,"This ""Extreme DVD"" edition of ""Terminator 2"" was already released a few years ago so if you already own it, skip this re-release.  However, this DVD is a shining example of delivering what DVD (and Blu-Ray for that matter) should.  There are great ""making of"" extras, an interactive ""pop-up"" feature, a fantastic James Cameron commentary and other extras that make this a can't miss purchase.

The ""Extreme DVD"" edition of ""Terminator 2"" adds a number of scenes to the theatrical version that clear up some of the questions I had.  For example, in the scene where the T-1000 has Sarah call for John in the steel mill.  I always wondered why it didn't just kill Sarah and imitate her voice and appearance.  As it turns out, this occurs after the T-1000 has been frozen, shattered and reformed.  Several moments in between these events reveals that the liquid terminator is malfunctioning which could explain why it needed Sarah to call out to John.  It isn't just a case of being afraid to kill off main characters after all.

""T2"" is another James Cameron classic and if you haven't seen it you're missing out on a great film.  And you should see it on this ""Extreme DVD"" edition.",1243641600,,1180,4.684466019417476
2135385,4,B0002WYTWG,"Here's another film from the 1980s that has reached ""classic"" status. Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. As I write this, there's a fourth Terminator just out on the silver screen.

In retrospect, what makes this ""Terminator"" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the next two Terminator movies.

Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the ""good guys."" The now famous phrase by Arnold, ""I'll be back."" comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.

Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains.

I bought the earlier blu-ray of T2 that came out last year for $10, and it looked terrible. It was grainier than the Ultimate DVD, but this T2 version is amazing! I love to be able to see the hairs on a person's arm, and the individual pores on their face.  This Disc delivers all of it without typical over-pixelation!  What do I mean?  Certain discs (like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" blu-ray discs) are digitized too much, causing you to see tiny pixel-dots everywhere; in faces, in the sky, etc.  Some people think this makes the picture more vivid, but the unnatural pixels everywhere is really annoying to me (especially with a 65"" LCD TV).  This T2 transfer is fantastic!  There is no annoying pixelation anywhere, but the picture is crisp and clear.  You will see pores on the actor's faces, every detail is rendered flawlessly.  This is as good as my other favorite Blu-Ray transfer ""The Bucket List"", which is also just as clear! No matter what you prefer, there has never been a better transfer of the film, ever.  The audio is also stunning, and you get all 3 versions of the film with the same clarity.  There is no need for any other transfer to ever be done.

2135390,4,B0002WYTWG,"""T2"" has been reissued on DVD so often by Lion's Gate and its predecessor studios that it has become an industry unto itself. That said, this is the best edition so far but it is flawed. First up if you don't have the latest firmware updates, it won't make it past the Lion's Gate logo. Secondly, once you do have that firmware installed due to the design, Java menu or both it takes forever to load on most machines.

The good news is that we get the bulk of the previous DVD ultimate edition from a couple of years back. That's also the bad news for those looking for new extras because there really aren't any just stuff repurposed from the previous release.

As far as the film itself it looks good although it looks like an older HD transfer to me. There is fine grain throughout and contrary to an earlier review at the Digital Bits it doesn't quite look like it's been overprocessed with DNR. Evidently according to that site the actual encoding may have been part of the process that created the look that it was over DNR'd for this release. There's quite a bit of fine detail evident throughout on second viewing. I still thought the film looked a bit soft considering it was shot in Super 35mm and based on previous viewings of the film part of that could be due to the encoding as well as the an the possibility that this uses an older HD master (probably the one used to prepare the DVD version from a couple of years back). Either way while it doesn't look perfect, it's still a firm step up from the DVD and the previous theatrical version on Blu-ray.

This includes all three versions of the movie (for the last version you have to input the date of ""Judgment Day"" to access the version with the alternate ending added to the film)including the theatrical and extended cuts of the movie on a single seamless branching edition of the film.

The sound is spectacular with the finest 6.1 mix I've heard and it's Lossless for those that are interested.

There's also an edition with a flimsy but attrarctive T2 head that divides up the extras and various editions onto separate discs allowing for a higher bit rate for the visuals.

Reportedly after Cameron finishes ""Avatar"" (remember this IS a rumor), he'll turn his attentiont to remastering this again. You can get this version or wait until that reported version hits the market. Either way this looks extremely good but could look better but sounds the best it has ever sounded.",1243209600,,2445,4.532879818594104
2135391,5,B0002WYTWG,"""The Terminator"" blends science fiction and horror into a non-stop classic film.  James Cameron's budget was beyond low but he succeeded in bringing the scares with brutal violence and breathless action.  The time travel storyline is simple here and it actually makes sense.  The characters act and react in what would probably be logical ways, given that they have a nearly indestructible killer cyborg stalking them.  And speaking of the cyborg, Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect for this role.  He's a huge, hulking mass and is intimidating to say the least.

The special effects are dated by today's standards, but if you're a fan of stop-action animation, there's some very cool scenes to drool over.  There is also some great model and old school puppet work, highlighted by the Terminator cutting into his arm and eyeball to do a few repairs.  Speaking of that, even though this film is very violent, the blood, gore and language is milder than you'd expect.  ""The Terminator"" is one of the greats of sci-fi cinema.  It always entertains and is endlessly re-watchable.",1243209600,,1075,5.022598870056497
2135392,5,B0002WYTWG,"The movie had me gripped from the eerie opening scene of Los Angeles in 2029: very bleak, dark, life-less, desolate, nothing moving except these huge menacing machines. And as they scourge the land, a message appears: The machines rose from the ashes of nuclear war. For years they had tried to eliminate the few remaining humans resisting them, but the final battle would not be fought in the future, it would be fought here in the present. Tonight.

With that cryptic message, the heart-pounding music begins and one of the most awesome opening title sequences starts and ""The Terminator"" is underway. Few movies have the audacity and confidence in their audience to reveal their plots as gradually as The Terminator. Unless you've seen one of the other Terminator movies you won't fully understand the plot until half-way through. It's a movie that's got it all: action, horror, a love story, and, above all, old school science fiction. It features Arnold Schwartzenegger in his most famous role, as the most merciless cybernetic organism to ever grace the silver screen (even more merciless than Darth Vader!). And you would have to be a machine to not be moved by the ending.

Part sci-fi time travel drama, part blood and guts shoot `em up, part action-adventure, THE TERMINATOR stands the test of time and remains a favorite in the hearts of its fans.

Arnold Schwarzenegger became a household name playing THE TERMINATOR, a killer cyborg from the future whose sole mission is to kill Sarah Connor.  His performance as the merciless, unstoppable killer is chilling.  This is the first movie in which he wore clothes for the majority of the film, and where he uttered what is arguably his most famous line ""I'll be back."" (Admittedly, he only had 18 lines!) Linda Hamilton is terrific as Sarah Connor, a young woman who is stronger than she thinks and is able to overcome incalculable odds.  The special effects are excellent, especially for 1984, and they still look great today.

I just plain like this movie.  I remember seeing it in the theatres in 1984, and being blown away.  And I still enjoy it after all these years.  I showed THE TERMINATOR to my 12 year old daughter a few days ago, and she thought that it was ""pretty cool,"" too.  High praise coming from a tween!",1242950400,,1222,4.637209302325582
2135401,3,B0002WYTWG,"This review is for the Collectors set with skull.  The skull is very solid, well made and will look great on your shelf.  It comes with batteries and there's also a on/off switch underneath the base.  The eyes light up and it plays sound effects from the movie.  The sound is terrible though, it just sounds like static noise.  The discs come in a separate case and you can also store them in the base of the skull.  The blue-ray disc is a pain and wouldn't register my internet connection and takes forever to load.  DTS and 5.1 sound wouldn't work on blue-ray for some reason.  The sound on the DVD versions worked great so it must be a blue-ray defect.  I'm pleased with the set except for the sound problems.  If you're a fan this might be worth picking up but it's far from perfect.",1242950400,,787,4.328767123287672
2135402,1,B0002WYTWG,"First, let me say that I'm a big fan of the Terminator series.  I'm also a very technical person (a real, live, computer engineer) with a lot of A/V experience.  For those of you that are into this sort of thing, I also happen to have some experience in neural network technology, but that's another story.

That said, I was really looking forward to watching the HD version of the Director's cut of T2 before going to the theater this weekend to see the new Terminator Salvation movie.  My son, now 14, had never seen any of the Terminator movies, and had only occasionally watched bits and pieces of the Terminator: Sarah Conner chronicles, so we started out by watching the original Terminator BD earlier this week.  Given that the original was made in 1982, the BD version, played in full HD and 5.1 THX surround, was a great (re-)introduction to the series.

My wife had ordered the T2 SkyNet Edition BD in April, and we were happily surprised to have it arrive in the mail from Amazon on the very day that the new Terminator movie was released in the US.  I removed it from the box, inserted it into my Sony BDP-S300 player, and then waited for it to boot...

As others have already noted here, we waited... and waited... and waited.  It took fully 3 minutes to complete the preliminary loading (a bit long, but not outrageous for a BD HD movie on our player), then the screen went dark for another 2 minutes.  At that point, we got the secondary loading message from ""SkyNet"", indicating that it had found a Blu-Ray Profile 1.x player, and that menu's would run in full animation mode [to access all content, a Blu-Ray Profile 2.0 player with internet access was recommended].  This secondary load screen remained visible for another 4 minutes, then the screen went dark again.

No audio, no video.  Nothing.  We waited another 5 minutes, then started pushing buttons on the remote.  The Menu command activated the drop-down, top-level menu for the BD, which allowed us to select options and settings for the play-back.  We selected the Directors Cut, and as soon as we did, the menu disappeared and we went back to the black screen for another 30-40 seconds.

Then, out of nowhere, the LionsGate splash screen appeared, and played in full THX surround-sound for a grand total of 23 seconds.  Then nothing.  Back to black, no audio, no video, and the BD player indicating that the track counter, and playback, had stopped.  Pressing the Play button on the remote momentarily caused the BD Player to switch back into play mode, but still nothing.

We went through this same exercise three more times, each time selecting different options from the top-level menu, trying to get it to play something.  Anything!  Unfortunately, every attempt ended the same way.

Based on the feedback others have provided here, I strongly believe that this is an error in the design of the T2/SNE BD-ROM.  I've (both before, and since) successfully played other BD movies on the same player, including the original Terminator and - just to test the player - my Ironman BD movie.  Everything works but T2/SNE.

Again, my player is a two-year old Sony BDP-S300 profile 1.0 BD player, with no ethernet port available.  So, I have no option of updating firmware on the player, nor do I have any option of utilizing the BD-Live features supposedly offered on the T2/SNE disc.

As I won't be spending another $300 to buy a new player to watch this movie in HD, I will be returning the BD-ROM to Amazon for a refund, and my family and I will happily enjoy the Director's cut of the film on up-converted DVD tonight.

My advice to the average consumer of this BD would be: if you don't have the absolute latest in BD player technology, avoid this BD at all costs.  Stick with the Extreme version of the T2 DVD.  It upconverts to full HD with only moderate graininess and plays full THX 5.1 surround sound without any issues whatsoever.",1242950400,,3916,4.655021834061135
2135403,5,B0002WYTWG,"Thanks to the new master, the detail is much greater on this DVD than previous releases. You're able to see small, fine, details in the backgrounds that you simply could not make out on the Ultimate Edition. That coupled with the adjusted color (supervised and approved by Lightstorm) and other improvements over previous releases; makes this the best looking Terminator 2 on DVD.

The harsh contrast found on the previous DVD is lowered to a much more natural level, which gives the overall picture a more film-like appearance. Even better, the excessive edge enhancement is just about completely gone. If those were the only improvements, it'd be enough to recommend the disc over the old transfer, but they aren't.

2000's Ultimate Edition featured a very good 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer that only had a couple minor problems. Most distracting was an excessive amount of edge enhancement, more grain than was normal for a Super 35 movie, and contrast that was just a bit hot.

For this new Extreme Edition, THX retransferred using the highest technology possible right now. They created a new electronic film master of the movie at the stunning resolution of 1920x1080 24 FPS. Basically, this new master would allow them to create new transfers of T2 for HDTV, and digital theatrical showings. This DVD is created from that gorgeous master, and is easily the best Terminator 2 has ever looked on the DVD format.

10 out of 10. BUY THIS DVD!",1242864000,,1454,4.94672131147541

This is my second Pioneer Elite blu-ray player, the first one purchased two years ago, so I'm familiar with blu-ray's iphone-like need for constant software upgrades. All my other blu-ray discs play perfectly, and it's all playing on a Runco VX-22d 3-chip 1080p projector, so that's not the problem. I think it's inexcusable that a disc is distributed that won't work on a modern higher-end system, much less a more mainstream system.

Now they've come back to us with another Blu-Ray release that's ostensibly the ""clearest T2's ever been,"" demanding another $20 from each of us for the privilege.  Hello?  You seriously expect me to pay a total of $50 for what I *should* have gotten for my original $30?  Seriously?  Where do you people get the stones?

2135409,5,B0002WYTWG,"So I picked this up today 5/20/09. I refuse to open it as a collector.  I won't review the movie because chances are if you are buying this version its not for the movie.

This item is a 1:1 scale plastic replica so its about the size of my head! Its huge, the biggest DVD case Ive ever bought. The base has a tray that slides out to store the 5 DVDs and 1 Blu Ray disk. If you don't like that idea you can keep the DVDs in an included keepsake case. The Replica skull plays sound bites of guns and action scenes from the movie while the eyes light up. For a DVD CASE there is a great deal of detail that went into this. But keep in mind its just that a DVD case. Its not a side show replica that will cost you hundreds of dollars. It's simply a unique limited edition plastic replica DVD case painted chrome.
I bought mine at best buy and canceled my order on amazon. Yeah it cost me more money but the outer box is mostly clear plastic. This stands a good chance of being damaged in shipping. If you are a collector I suggest shelling out a few extra bucks and pick it up locally in person vs having it shipped if that option is available to you.

Assuming you buy yours at Best Buy, and you are NOT a collector and actually plans on opening it- You may find ""BEST BUY EXCLUSIVE"" sticker on the front advertising a $50 Sideshow collectible gift card inside. I assume from reading the sticker this is only available at BEST BUY. So if there is no sticker assume there is no Gift Card inside.

Now on to the Disks and features. You get the New SkyNet Edition Blu ray  disk, a digital copy, and all 4 special feature DVDs from both previous editions (Extreme and Ultimate editions) making this a 1 stop shop ultimate collection for any T2 fan who doesn't own any of the other versions. Or an expensive double dip if you do own any of the previous versions.

Over 8 hrs of interactive extras and 6.1 DTS-HD audio and the D Box option.

If you are unaware of what DBOX is, its an add on device that you connect to your audio system and the other end under your seat. This device then turns sound into vibration so you feel like you are in the movie. (I just turn my subs up ;))

Also includes a THX optimizer
BD LIVE
Games, Trivia
Audio Commentaries

2135410,4,B0002WYTWG,"I found out nearly a year ago (when I bought my new blu-ray player) that brand new release blu-ray DVDs use the latest technology, which means you have to update your blu-ray player's software (firmware) every month or two.  Aggravating - but a fact you get used to.  If you can't play this DVD, find out how to update your player's firmware.

(By the way, my 4 stars is my rating of the movie itself... not my personal blu-ray problem.)",1242864000,,437,4.4375
2135411,3,B0002WYTWG,"OK, so the movie itself has been around so long that anyone who is considering buying the second Blu-Ray release already knows and loves the film. I held off getting the original Blu-Ray release because of less-than-stellar reviews of the image quality.  This one seems to have taken care of that problem.  I have watched ""T2"" many times on DVD (the ""ultimate"" edition), and the Blu-Ray transfer is definitely superior.  The audio seems about the same to me, but I only have a 5.1 receiver and it doesn't support HDMI, so I can't really take full advantage of the lossless audio.

However, I can state without reservation that this Blu-Ray disc has the slowest loading time *by far* of any that I own.  I'm not exaggerating when I say it takes at least a minute or two for the initial load, and then all you get (unless your Blu-Ray player is connected to the internet, which mine it not) is a message from ""Skynet"" that you're not connected to the internet.

You're then given the option to ""retry"" or ""cancel"", with no explanation of what to do if all you want is to watch the movie.  If you hit ""cancel"", you wait for a very long time (5 minutes at least) for ""Skynet"" to connect to its ""mainframe"".  I guess they're trying to be cute with all this Skynet stuff, but they fail miserably.

If you inadvertently hit ""stop"" on your remote while watching the movie, you get to go through the whole ordeal again.  It's worse than discs that come with multiple previews (*cough cough* Disney), because at least you can skip through those.  This one won't let you go to the top menu, or anything else, until it's ready.  You just sit and wait for it to finish loading.  Granted, I haven't recently upgraded the firmware on my 4-month-old Sony Blu-Ray player, but since the disc plays fine once it has loaded, I don't think this is the issue.

Once you get to the main menu, it's clunky, awkward, and slow to respond. You'll think you've made the selection you want, only to discover that the disc can't quite keep up with you.  It's all very annoying and totally unnecessary.  I have many other discs that offer all sorts of enhancements for players that are connected to the internet, and none of them makes you go through all this endless waiting.  Some reviewers here on Amazon have reported that they've given up on the disc, assuming that it would never load, so all I can say is, be patient, it may take 5 or 10 minutes, but don't give up, it may surprise you (or maybe not).

So, my final rating is 3 stars for a favorite movie with what's probably the best video transfer we'll ever get, but with this absurdly slow load time and ridiculous menu, I cannot give it the full 5 stars I would have otherwise.",1242777600,,2708,4.469512195121951
2135412,1,B0002WYTWG,"I have a machine that's only a few months old-- the SONY BDP-350, and I can't play the damn disc, just like some other people are gradually beginning to discover the hard way. My player has performed perfectly for me up to now, even playing other discs which have also been reported to be problematic. Just to be sure it wasn't a damaged disc, I returned it and tried a second one- same trouble.

The movie will not play and I can't get past the STUDIO CANAL logo. Supposedly some of us are required to do a 2.0 Firmware Update, and I've been told that even after doing THAT it may not work. I think this is a disgrace, and I'm not thrilled with the idea of having to go crazy doing firmware upgrades and God only knows what else (someone said the Sony player also requires a ""memory slide"" or something??). Screw that - I shouldn't have to jump through a dozen hoops and mazes just to get a movie to play. I'm going back to the store and am demanding a refund. Lionsgate will hear an earful from me for pulling this kind of ""internet connect"" crap. I just want to watch the damn movie in my living room on my HDTV without the net!!

This is a headache none of us need. There are a lot of DVD people sitting on the fence who are afraid to get into Blu-ray for reasons just like this, and this isn't helping Blu-ray's reputation at all. What the hell is all this garbage lately that everything has to be ""internet capable""??

2135416,3,B0002WYTWG,"Okay, so you know the movie.  You know that this has three versions of it (the third is accessed with the code of the original Judgment Day (82997)).  What you might not know is how it looks:  Very textureless and plasticy (plasticky?).

And that's the biggest problem here.  In an attempt to remove the ""noise"" in the picture, this edition of Terminator 2 also ends up removing the natural film grain from the picture.  What does this do?  It makes the picture TOO sharp, TOO clear, and ends up giving the feeling that everything has been sprayed with a shiny kind of plastic, removing the textures from just about everything.  (Obviously one can see that road is road and that cloth is cloth, but skin in particular looks TOO smooth, at least to me.)

I only own this release and the old Ultimate Edition on DVD, and I'll tell you right now that this picture is superior to the DVD.  However, on my 42-inch plasma, running at 1080i, I can clearly see that this movie has had its grain-reduction WAY overdone.  The sound is good, the movie is as good as ever, and the video is better than DVD.  However, it's not as good as it SHOULD be, and that is disappointing.

Caveat emptor in this case, especially since this probably means some kind of triple-dip sometime in the next two or three years.

UPDATE 5/20/2009:  There's more and more discussion about how much grain-reduction was actually done on this film, especially at thedigitalbits.com.  I'm not terribly interested in getting into discussions of ""did-they or didn't-they"", so let me just say this:  When I watch this on my display (which is not state-of-the-art but is respectable on a PS3-HDMI-42""-plasma-1080i setup), I think that the image looks too smooth.  I expected a grainier look from the Super35 photochemical film process Cameron used.  I still think this is the best release of T2 available in terms of video + multiple versions.  I just wouldn't be surprised if a ""better"" edition comes out two years from now with an ""improved"" transfer/remaster.

Now I see this ""Extreme"" DVD edtiion is on sale here at Amazon for a mere $4.99.  Wow, now that's a deal.

I enjoyed all three of the ""Terminator"" films but this one has always stood out.....because of the villain and the incredible special-effects.

When this movie came out, the FX regarding Robert Patrick's cyborg-patrol cop were so jaw- dropping, so astounding that people couldn't believe what they were seeing. Some 15 years later, they are still cool.

Watching Patrick morph into various characters is incredible, literally changing shapes or having his fingers or arms extend to an awl-like instruments. For a long time, he looks like the most indestructible ""person"" I've ever seen in a film. He certainly is still one of the most unique villains ever shown on film.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, an intelligent but less-advanced cyborg, plays the only likable character. The mother-son combination of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong are too hard-edged, too smart-mouthed for my tastes. Hamilton was a lot more feminine and humanistic in the first ""Terminator."" Now she's ultra-macho and profane. Much worse than her is her kid, a real punk if there ever was one. There's something very irritating about Furlong, and not just the character he plays here. I'm not surprised he never became a star.

Still, despite all these annoyances, as a fan of special-effects and a good adventure yarn, I can't help but wonder now how this looks on Blu-Ray!  I guess others do, too, which which may be why this ""Extreme"" edition can be had for such a small price.",1241481600,,1786,4.969798657718121

2135425,4,B0002WYTWG,"I agree with Mr. Big's review. I watched the original 2006 blu-ray release, and I found the picture to be far too light and pretty noisy. After reading the reviews on amazon of the 2006 disc, I decided to wait for a re-release, which I hoped would offer better picture quality. In my opnion, the ""skynet edition"" does exactly that. The blacks are deeper, and the colors are as a result richer. There is some loss of fine detail, but it's still a noticeable improvement over the DVD releases and, IMHO, a welcome addition to the rather large family of T2 discs.

On to the movie itself --- the disc contains the theatrical version, which I personally prefer. Left out is a dream sequence scene, in which Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, hero of the first film) visits Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to admonish Sarah to do whatever she can to protect son John (Edward Furlong), who will become the leader of the human resistance after judgment day. While it was certainly nice to see future soldier Reese again on the director's cut DVD (I think Biehn is the most underrated part of the first film), this scene felt tacked on, which is probably why Cameron didn't include it in the theatrical release. Also thankfully left out is a hokey scene in which John teaches the T-800 terminator (Arnie) how to smile.

Bottom line, this is a better quality blu-ray than the 2006 edition, and since amazon is offering it for $14.99, a relative bargain if you want to have the thus-far best T2 disc.",1240790400,,1480,4.6022727272727275

2135430,5,B0002WYTWG,"Some speak of this BD disc in regards to the 5th Element, which was just a bad transfer. The Terminator was a low budget film, unlike T2 and the 5th Element. I expect those two films to look good, I don't expect miracles from The Terminator. Now when you consider the first DVD edition and the rare Super VHS edition, this is a huge step up. Originally the sound was in mono, then they stepped it up to surround sound and uncompressed PCM at that! It is the source that is at fault, but it STILL looks better than many films on BD.

You can take a home movie that was shot on VHS, DVD Cam or HD, which will look best went put on Blu Ray? It is the source. Not all sources are good and not all were shot on high quality 70mm film. It is low budget from 1984, what do you expect? Even much larger budget films from 1983-1988 have a similar look, maybe a little cleaner. Not all movies are shot on the same films with the same cameras or the same lighting.  You will have variation.

I think they did a great job on this film especially when you compare it with the never ending remasters of T2.  T2 had a higher budget and higher quality, not to mention digital effects.  T1 was low budget like a martial arts film from the 1970's.  You cannot expect everything in HD to look the same or look like The Incredible Hulk.  I know some early James bond films from the 60's look better than some from the 90's when in theory the 90's films should look way better, but it has to be the source.  Although in the 90's Bond films, it could be the transfer since I know the source had to have been great with the digital effects and all.

Take it from me.  I had the VHS and Super VHS versions as well as DVD, this IS a very good upgrade in HD.",1239408000,,1732,4.067647058823529

When you watch this on blu-ray take into account how old this movie actually is and you will come away with a new appreciation of how well it was filmed originally. The picture is crisp, the colors are really sharp, the contrast is perfect. The sound has obviously been tweaked, not in a ""WTF that doesn't sound right!"" fashion but cleaner - what you would expect from blu-ray.

The scene where Sarah is breaking out of the asylum and she breaks a guard's arm - you'll cringe :)

For the price you cannot go wrong with this one! Revisit an absolute classic. With more recent releases being expensive and really not worth the price (it should be cheaper to snag a blu ray than to see it in the theater - my opinion )this is an easy purchase. Even if you have never seen this one and think Ahnuld is cheesey pick this up - you'll understand why we all love a good Ahhhhnuuuuld flick. Really you've got to love this one.

Alright, so this is the Blu Ray edition of T2: Judgment Day so it should be amazing like the movie right? NO. This Blu Ray edition features no special features, a regular DTS-6.1 audio soundtrack and a MPEG-2 video transfer. Thus, the film looks grainy (which is not good for this film), colors can look washed out and the black levels aren't the best. Detail is good, and close up shots look great but given that this is one of the earliest BR releases, it doesn't live up to today's standard. Don't get me wrong, it does look better than the DVD editions for the most part but it doesn't justify a true high definition version of this film. So we have a sub-par looking high definition release of T2 that lacks any special features (Come on, no special features at all? We've had like 5 releases of the film on DVD loaded with so much bonus features and this has none?? WHY?). All in all, is it worth the money? Not really. I found this at Wal-Mart for a flat $10.00 so it was worth it just to watch it again but not the same can be said for everyone else. My opinion, if you own the DVD and a Blu Ray player, you're good for now. In May when the new Terminator film releases, there will be a new release of T2 that will present a better video and audio transfer as well as some special features and multiple versions of the film. It's called the SkyNet Edition. There's also supposed to be a Ultimate Edition with like 6 discs, featuring every edition of the movie on DVD plus the Blu Ray version.

A great movie, yes, but certainly not a showpiece for your home entertainment setup. And the bare bones aspect of the release isn't a saving grace.

Lions Gate, step up and release a version worthy of the source, for this and T1. Amazon, jumbling up these product reviews is just dirty.

If you're looking at the Blu-ray disc and wondering why all the reviews are for the 'Ultimate Edition DVD', so was I!

I guess they cross reference.

Anyway, the only thing you need to know is that this is NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT of T2, so be warned. I'm sure there will be a subsequent re-release of this in a Director's Cut Edition in an attempt to get people to re-buy the Blu-ray another time; on top of the countless times we've all purchased this on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, Blu-ray, and whatever is coming next. For that reason, and that reason alone I have marked down my score on this. I don't approve of the blatant money grab, and as a fan, it offends me.

The movie itself looks and sounds great though, especially for its age. In my opinion it has aged pretty well, considering the advancements in technology since its original theatrical release. Again, my average score is in response to the disregard for consumers, trying to take us to the woodshed one more time to milk this old (but fantastic) classic.

It looks no better than the DVD. In fact, the DVD may look better. You really see it in the credits type. In every other Blu-ray I have, they're crystal clear and sharp edged. Here, like in the DVD, they're very soft. The only other place I've seen type this soft is in the DVD of WKRP in Cincinnati, which was shot on videotape. In addition, the picture is frequently grainy and thin. Again, the DVD is the same way, but the Blu-Ray's higher definition makes the thin picture more obvious. The second problem is the extra features: Would you believe the Blu-ray doesn't have all the extras on the DVD? One of the documentaries from the DVD is missing.

In short, if you have the DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray. If you don't have either, get the DVD. It's cheaper, the picture is just as good (or you can say the Blu-ray is just as bad), and it's got more extras.",1232928000,,1014,4.30890052356021

Despite the fact that I awarded the film 5 stars, the high definition film version can only be seen with  Interactua software - which is NOT compatible with Windows Vista! However, the film in `normal' THX, Dolby Digital 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1 (you get the point) is absolutely mesmerizing itself- just turn up the volume!

The extra feature, `frame-by-frame' behind the scenes explanation subtitles is so thorough that you literarily have to pause the film every 2 seconds, due to the amount of text.  Perhaps it is because I'm not fast reader, but it does become rather tedious to have to pause and rewind so often.

I reckon if the two features (behind-the-scenes subtitles and feature video clips) had been viewable as separate options one would only need concentrate on one feature and enjoy the other on another occasion. Yes, you would have to see the film again - but the film is so good it is worth seeing over and over again.

2135464,4,B0002WYTWG,"For those who haven't seen it yet, the first Terminator movie is an awesome thriller about a rampant cyborg sent to terminate Sarah Conner.

It's a classic movie story that so many people remember. A mysterious cyborg is sent 40 years into the past to kill Sarah Conner. Sarah is the mother of John Conner, the future leader of humans who would lead the revolution against the evil robot empire of DynaNet in the future. Kyle, one of the revolution soldiers, is sent 40 years in the past to protect Sarah.

It's an awfully simple plot, and the Terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a mindless killing machine who can smash his hands through windows, crush bones and shoot shotguns and machine-guns from motorcycles. ""The Terminator"" is pretty intense, with guns and explosions peppered through the movie.

This is a memorable film for Sarah Conner actor Linda Hamilton, who would later play the futuristic law enforcer, Robocop. And the love story is surprisingly compassionate. While we've all seen the masochistic male terrorist with weapons of mass destruction many times before, this is one of the first films in which the heavy-duty robotics to help humans in the post-modern world turns against humans to apparently start a wicked apocalypse.

Michael Biehn also does a splendid job as Kyle Reese, the no-holds-barred guy who provides most of the dialogue. Ladies will no doubt swoon when they see his steamy sex scene with Sarah. And his flashbacks (or flash forwards?) of his life in the future are pretty dramatic, portraying a post-war slum world of burning oil drums, filthy streets and starving humans.

Of course, director James Cameron was probably better known for that film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in the one of the corniest romances ever made in the history of cinema. But ""The Terminator"" was a great start, with minimalist special effects and hard-hitting drama. And yes, the animatronic robot in the end sequence is somewhat primitive nowadays, but he still is pretty damn scary.",1231891200,,2025,5.0148809523809526

That voice was a mere pipsqueak of a thing, looking up at this spectacle of a film, which was so aggressively big, it was like looking up at a tidal wave, breaking over you, with so much of everything crashing down.  Oh, sure, it's got its interesting time-travel premise and the neato liquid-metal terminator.  But foremost, it was an ARNOLD vehicle, with every scene written so Arnold can perform his cooler-than-thou shtick, consisting mostly of catchphrases and lots of destruction while carrying a really loud gun.  All of  those complaints aside, I'm enthusiastic enough about the Blu-ray experience and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day-Blu-ray/dp/B000EWBKKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Blu-ray</a>] was cheap enough that I thought I'd take another look.

Well, I've decided it: Blu-ray or not, it was indeed plumb boring.  People were reduced to cartoon characters Arnold can perform his routines on.  For example, without breaking his stride, he shoots a guard in the knee, then without looking back, cites to John that this stunt remained in strict compliance with John's earlier enjoinder against killing people.  I didn't think it was cute, the deliberate injury to an innocent person presented as a cool joke.  This is not a good movie.  It's not good science fiction; it's not good drama; it's not good comedy.  Remove the flamboyant pyrotechnics and the contrived coolness, and what's left?  ARNOLD, and his terrible acting.  I seriously doubt this movie will be regarded highly by film buffs twenty years from now.

As for this Blu-ray edition, the high definition didn't add anything to the experience.  How can it?  It's so full of action, there's no room for anything else that could benefit from a hi-def display.  Any artistry brought to this venture was expended on the pyrotechnics.  The cinematography was efficient and cold, with the simplest aim: to assault the audience with bullets and bombs.  So while it was a noisy movie, there wasn't much to SAVOR visually; not like, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner-Blu-ray/dp/B000UBMWG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gattaca-Blu-ray/dp/B000HEVZ6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gattaca [Blu-ray</a>], sumptuous visual feasts you'll indulge again and again.  If you've already seen it, and you own the SD DVD, there's nothing more for you here on Blu-ray.

Nor are there any extras to sweeten the deal.  This Blu-ray edition is indeed a stripped-down affair.  The studio probably threw this together to meet the sudden demand for Blu-ray titles, but you can bet there's a big fat Blu-ray SE coming down the pike.  So to those to whom this matters, you despair is unwarranted.

Undoubtedly my strong criticism for this film will garner a lot of angry ""no"" votes, with the readers clicking the button as if they were slashing my tires.  Be that as it may.  So that my Blu-ray library doesn't become as cluttered as my SD DVD library has become, I gave my copy away to my son.

2135468,1,B0002WYTWG,"I purchased this Blu-ray recently and found it to be a waste of money.  YES, TERMINATOR 2 is unspeakably awesome; YES, TERMINATOR 2 on Blu-ray is a good thing...BUT NOT THIS VERSION.

For one, it's THEATRICAL CUT ONLY!

Second, this version is EXTREMELY BARE BONES: it's just the movie and 2 commentary tracks (one from 1993, the other from 2003) and THAT'S IT.  For a movie with so much technical precision and BTS material found on previous releases, this is a GRIEVOUS oversight.

Third (and final), the transfer is TERRIBLE.  The original film is a bit grainy to begin with, but in previous VHS and DVD transfers it was never enough to be distracting.  Here, in 1080 resolution, the grain is so bothersome that it strikes me more as digital noise--even STATIC at worst--than actual celluloid texture.  I get the feeling they went through the HD transfer process as fast as possible to cash in on the HD market.  It looks little better than what the old DVD version would on upconvert.

Interestingly, I recently bought THE ROAD WARRIOR on Blu-ray and noticed the difference.  Both ROAD WARRIOR and TERMINATOR 2 have roughly the same amount of grain in their image (and the VHS and DVD transfers were comparable), but the Blu-ray transfer of THE ROAD WARRIOR is GLORIOUS, and the grain actually accentuates the image (worth every penny); logically, the TERMINATOR 2 image should be on par at LEAST, but instead it underperforms.

So don't buy this Blu-ray release of it yet, because if history is any teacher, TERMINATOR 2 is going to receive the same double and triple-dipping treatment it did on DVD, and the next release is likely to have a better transfer and bonus features...the same thing already happened with THE FIFTH ELEMENT.",1231027200,,1739,4.818181818181818

If its about 10 dollars or so, or if they rerelease it with special features and improved definition then it would be worth it otherwise just stick with the special editon dvd.",1230768000,,534,4.659574468085107

T2 is a BD-25 (half-size) Blu-ray disc and contains no lossless audio track. In other words, it doesn't come close to exploiting the capabilities of the Blu-ray format, so why bother?

Save your ten dollars, and wait for the ""remastered"" Blu-ray version that I'm quite sure will be released in the future. I'm sure it will contain a better image as well as a real, uncompressed audio track. This is similar to what happened with The Fifth Element: The first Blu-ray version of the movie was terrible, and was followed up by a remastered version. Embarrassing to say the least.

Note that I am rating the Blu-ray edition of this movie and its shortcomings. I'm frustrated that it's barely an improvement over some of the excellent DVD versions available.

One of the best action movies ever deserves to be a ""reference"" quality production that you would use to show off your home theater, but instead it falls far short.

A few small bands of humans (survivors of the nuclear war between man and machine), under the lead of a man named John Connor, fight these artificially-intelligent monsters. Finally, the humans emerge victorious, and the machines are virtually defeated. But the machines have another plan. They will destroy John Connor by killing his mother, Sarah Connor,  before she gives birth to her son. They send through time the TERMINATOR, a cybernetic organism (flesh-covered robot), back to the year 1984. It will stop at nothing, until its mission -- to kill Sarah Connor -- is completed.
  In this science fiction phenomenon of a film, we see screenwriter/director James Cameron at his best. For over two decades, this movie has held its iconic position as one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. He tells a story of the future, but gives a feeling of legend, of a struggle of incomprehensible proportions, a dark story that seems like there is no possibility of victory. But Cameron does not leave us in utter depression, but always leaves a glimmer of hope. Throughout the film, we are treated to Brad Fiedel's perfectly-matched soundtrack, including one of the greatest pieces of modern movie music ever recorded --- the haunting TERMINATOR theme.
  This is a movie that is highly recommended, to both sci-fi fans and non-sci-fi fans. It supersedes those bounds, and falls into a class all its own.

Well having The Terminitor series on DVD and loving them and having recently upgraded to a blu-ray player I decided to take the plunge and upgrade my collection to high definition blu-ray format.

Boy, what a mistake that was.

Picture quality is AWFUL - well awful for blu-ray anyway. They've taken the same standard definition source as the DVD and upscaled it for blu-ray - but it's still standard definition. Only the menu is in High Definition, the movie is not. I tested my DVD version upscaled against the blu-ray edition and found them identical - if anything the DVD came out slightly on top.

It also only contains 2 extras - the special effects making of and the retrospective - nothing else. My DVD edition contains over a dozen extras.

My verdict if you're thinking of buying The Terminator in blu-ray and you have an upscaling DVD/BD player - forget it. Stick with the DVD version instead, picture is the same and it has more extras. It's cheaper too.

Maybe one day this wonderful movie will receive the treatment it deserves and be digitally remastered and have it's frames scanned with a high definition camera - but until then sit on your DVD's and wait.",1227916800,,1249,4.654545454545454

After some research I found this was a poor example of Blu Ray.

Unless they come up with a better quality transfer I would save my money and stick with the DVD - although at $[...] for the blu ray there is not much savings.

I would suggest checking out this thread before purchasing blu ray movies.

2135481,3,B0002WYTWG,"I think it's safe to say that you aren't watching an Arnold movie for the acting, right?  You want to see things blow up and people get shot, right?  Well, if that is what you are looking for than this is probably the best way to get that fix.  `The Terminator' is one of those cult films that every `guy' in America, and quite possibly all over the world, has seen and has loved.  I personally saw it for the first time about a month ago.

What...a whirlwind.

I was totally in the dark going in, so the fact that Arnold actually plays a bad guy was like a big ""whoa"" moment for me, but whatever, I'm in the minority and I accept that.

The film takes place in the present (well, the 80's) but the real story is what happen in the future, the year 2029 to be exact.  The world is overrun by the machines.  These machines devise a plan to change the future by altering the past.  In other words; they send a robot to the present to kill off the mother of humanity's savior before she has a chance to birth him.  That woman is Sarah Connor.  In order to save humanity a man named Kyle Reese travels back in time to save Sarah from the Terminator.

The film is riddled with bad dialog and bad acting, all except Linda Hamilton, who actually turns out a very respectable performance as the conflicted and confused Sarah.  Arnold is, well, Arnold and Michael Biehn is horrible as Kyle, but like I mentioned earlier, the acting is far from the point of the film.

Some of the effects and CGI are a little weak, especially as the film draws to a close and the Terminator is reduced to his metallic shell, but the film is an 80's gem and so its technical flaws are forgiven.  Personally though, I couldn't help but draw comparisons to the vastly superior `Matrix' film, which carries a similar storyline yet executes it much better.  I know that a lot of devoted fans may hate me for saying that, but I'm just trying to be realistic here.

This brings me to my point mentioned in my title.  Is this really a classic?  I mean, looking at the film for what it is, a sci-fi action film, and then looking at where we have come in terms of special effects, acting and direction, I can't see why one would want to watch this when so many other options are much better.  `The Matrix' for example is much smarter, much sleeker and constructed much better.  Sure, Reeves is not the greatest actor in the world, but `The Matrix' may be the one film where his breed of apathetic deliver is desired.  `The Terminator' just doesn't stack up to modern spins on the genre and so it baffles me that so many stick by its side.  Sure, sometimes we have a special fondness for the films we grow up with, but honestly, this is generic and decent at best, but there is much better to be found elsewhere.",1227225600,,2775,4.292307692307692

2135487,4,B0002WYTWG,"I thought this was a really good dvd. My only concern really, was the fact that the picture quality as people have said is a bit grainy, but on the positive side, I find this movie with the grainy picture adds some character. Most of the old movies looked this way, and adds a bit of creepiness to the movie.

But onto easter eggs. They're kind of cheesy, but are entertaining. If you're on I think the special features page, and I think the sound page? if you keep clicking the curser around in all directions it will jump up to a little square that is up above the words that says things like Trailers or whatever. If you keep clicking this same little box it plays a few different short interviews. Even after you watched the short interview, click the same link again, and it'll play a different interview. Not sure how many there are in total.

It's kinda cheesy though because it's just a still picture of whoever they're interviewing, and the sound is rolling. So it's mainly an audio interview, but with still pictures thrown in. They interview James Cameron I think, as well as Michael Biehn, and a few of the effects guys.
It's really cool. I mean it's not much as far as extras, but at least it's something, so I can't really complain. So anyone who has this dvd, and hasn't found the Easter Eggs, definitely fidget around with it, and you will find em.",1223769600,,1364,4.430278884462151
2135488,5,B0002WYTWG,"After the success of ""The Terminator"" in 1984, it strikes me as somewhat odd that there wasn't a sequel rushed directly into production as soon as the original was deemed a hit. Nowadays, it seems like once a movie surpasses what it cost to make the movie then a sequel is virtually inevitable. This also seemed to be the mindset around certain movies back in the 1980's, especially the slasher type of films; but for whatever reason seven long years passed between the release of ""The Terminator"" before director and writer James Cameron re-teamed with his stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton for ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"".

""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" picks up approximately ten or so years after the events of the first film. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has been locked away in a mental institution after her crazed warnings of an impending holocaust at the hands of machines, and her 10-year old son John (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents. After the initial failure of the first Terminator to complete its mission of eliminating Sarah, the evil Skynet has sent back an even more advanced model, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), to hunt down and kill her son John before he can grow up to become the leader of the human resistance. However, John's future self is not without his own resources as he has sent back a weapon of his own to protect his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) identical to the one that attempted to kill his mother ten years before.

A general rule about movies is that nine times out of ten the sequel may be on par with the original film, but rarely will it ever surpass what had come before; however, I feel very confident in saying that ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is easily one prime example of an exception to that rule. ""The Terminator"" was an excellent sci-fi movie that mixed futuristic elements with those of the modern day, but some may have wondered what more story could there possibly be since Sarah defeated the first Terminator, which should have saved her son and the future as well. Based on what I saw in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", or ""T2"" for short, what happened in the original was merely the beginning of a much bigger problem for mankind.

Writer/director James Cameron has once more crafted an extremely taut, perfectly paced, sci-fi thriller that is leaps and bounds above what was done in the first movie. The story for ""T2"" is much bigger, the drama is more intense, the action is pulse-pounding, and the visual effects are still incredible even to this day. James Cameron must have known that he was merely laying the initial groundwork in ""The Terminator"" for a vast mythology surrounding mankind's future against the evil machines, because that last scene in the original movie hinted that something bigger may be on the horizon. Even though so many of us had seen the first movie and caught on to the hint that there may be more to tell, who knew it would be this massive blockbuster of a film that remains just as popular all these years later. Where the first film briefly touched upon Skynet and gave us brief glimpses at the war that awaits us in the future, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" takes all of that and builds upon it greatly. ""T2"" explores how events in the original movie actually set into motion the events of the future, shows us a very emotionally raw heroine in Sarah Connor, a different side to the Terminator from the first film, and to top it off gave us even more glimpses into the future battles that will ravage mankind. The only thing I can say about the story for ""T2"" is that it is simply awesome, and is quite possibly one of the greatest follow-up story's I have ever seen come out of Hollywood.

The cast of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is comprised of a few familiar faces and some new ones as well. Linda Hamilton reprises her role of Sarah Connor with a much more emotionally charged performance than what was required of her in the original movie. Sarah is a completely different person than she was when we last saw her, now she is this highly trained warrior that is emotionally scarred and torn by what she feels to be her duty to train her son to become the leader of man, and yet to still protect him and care for him as her child. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, just as he promised in the first movie, as a reprogrammed Terminator, and proves yet again that this was the one role that he was born to play. Even though the character is just a machine, there are very neat moments within the movie where without saying much of anything, Arnold allows the Terminator to convey that there is some kind of connection that exists, a bond if you will, between the Terminator and John. James Cameron's script really aided Arnold in what he was able to do with the Terminator this time around by exploring the fact that the machines can learn from and mimic humans, which allowed Arnold to show some, albeit limited, emotions while still remaining in character.

Joining the returning cast members we have newcomer Edward Furlong (""American History X"") as John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance. Considering the fact that ""T2"" was his first acting gig, Edward did an amazing job of bringing John to life in a very realistic way as a troubled kid whose destiny is too big for him to possibly fathom. The way Edward handled John's interactions with the Terminator was very interesting, because early on John sees the machine as a means to an end, nothing more than an overgrown action figure of sorts; however, over the course of the movie he begins to form a bond with the Terminator that becomes almost like a father-son relationship, that was at times quite poignant. The other new addition to the series was actor Robert Patrick (""We Are Marshall"") as the new, deadlier, and much more sophisticated T-1000 Terminator model. Robert was given a very physically challenging role that required a lot of physical activity, but from an acting standpoint the role didn't really challenge him all that much. That being said, as unchallenging as it was onscreen in the acting realm, I'm sure the preparation for all of the visual effects associated with his character were most likely quite time consuming and at times daunting.

In the first movie the visual effects were very good, especially given the time at which the film was made, although over time I admit that some of the effects have lost their luster. While that statement is true for 1984's ""The Terminator"", it couldn't be farther from the truth when referring to the stellar special effects work done for 1991's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". While technology has definitely improved significantly since 1991, the effects within this movie still hold up quite well, and while maybe not as perfect as today's effects, they are still very impressive in their own right. For example the morphing technology, used to create the numerous effects sequences for the liquid Terminator, was so mind-blowing back in 1991, and yet even today it still looks astonishing.

As I stated earlier, while ""The Terminator"" was a great movie, what James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger were able to achieve with the sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is simply amazing. Everything about this movie is just bigger and better than what was done in the original film, and this is an example of the kind of sequel that all studios should strive for when making a franchise.

2135490,4,B0002WYTWG,"With the new television season in full swing I find myself bombarded with a plethora of new shows vying for my attention, few will actually succeed in gaining it in the end; however, as many new shows try to become new favorites of mine, I still remain loyal to the ones I've enjoyed from previous seasons. One such show that became a favorite of mine last season was the Fox network's mid-season replacement ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"". Now that the new season of this show has gone on for a few episodes, I recently found myself wanting to re-watch the original movies that spawned this entertaining weekly sci-fi series. So, I got out my Blu-ray copies of the Terminator trilogy and had myself a thrilling, action-packed, sci-fi weekend of machines bent on destroying humanity.

""The Terminator"" is set in the year 1984 where a young woman named Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is trying to make a life for herself; however, that life may soon be cut short as a deadly cyborg, called a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), arrives from the future to kill her. As it turns out, Sarah is to eventually give birth to a boy who will one day grow up to become humanity's last great hope for survival against the onslaught of these seemingly unstoppable killing machines. Now, Sarah is in a desperate struggle for survival for not only her own life and that of her unborn child, but also for the future of all mankind.

Science-fiction movies when done well can be extremely entertaining pieces of cinema that on occasion become important facets of our popular culture. Prior to 1984, the Star Wars and Star Trek movies were the two biggest science-fiction franchises ever to be made. That is, until a little known director named James Cameron released a movie starring a former Austrian body builder that would become the first true blockbuster for both men's careers, and cement Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cinematic icon, causing his character to become one of the most quoted and recognizable characters of all time.

The story for ""The Terminator"" is a blend of both present day (well, back when 1984 was present day) reality with that of a dark, bleak future where humanity's days could very well be numbered. The concept of having a cybernetic killer come back from the future to end the life of an innocent woman and her as yet unborn child was an intriguing one. It was made even more intriguing by the introduction of her protector (Michael Biehn) who was sent back in time by Sarah's very own son to protect his mother and prevent the Terminator from succeeding in its mission. Talk about a mind-bending storyline. An interesting element within this movie is that the future may not be set in stone, which introduces some really interesting consequences into the story depending on what happens; therefore making the movie feel a bit more unpredictable and original than one might expect from the genre. It was nice to see that even back in 1984, long before the recent crop of sci-fi/superhero films set against a realistic, modern day backdrop, writer/director James Cameron was smart enough to create a fairly realistic world for his characters and his far fetched idea (although it doesn't seem nearly as far fetched with today's technology) to exist within. Thus, allowing us in the audience an easier time of relating to these characters who find themselves in this bizarre situation.

Leading the cast for ""The Terminator"" we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, who found great success as one of Hollywood's new action heroes in films such as, ""Predator"", ""Commando"", and ""Total Recall"", and all of it was due to his star making performance in this movie. The fact that Arnold became such a big star from this movie is actually somewhat surprising to me given the fact that he barely speaks in his role, shows zero emotional range (which is appropriate given that his character is a cyborg), and isn't exactly challenged in a physical way either. Regardless of all of this, Arnold still managed to create a villain that instills fear by being this ultimate killing machine, not to mention the eerie way in which he systematically scans a room is perfectly robotic and creepy at the same time. All the while you'll find yourself wondering is this possibly the future of our machines with the way A.I. is becoming more and more advanced these days. Just a little bit strange to think about, isn't it.

The supporting cast led by Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn was surprisingly solid, providing intriguing characters that were easily accessible, allowing for us to quickly begin rooting for their survival and ultimate success against the onslaught of the Terminator. Linda Hamilton (""Dante's Peak"") was given the most to do out of everyone within the cast. Over the course of this movie we see her character run through a wide range of emotions; from happiness to fear, from fear to surprising romantic bliss to an eventual undeterred resolve. Linda proved in this movie that she was definitely star material, by creating such a three-dimensional character that began the movie as a virtual nobody and ended it poised to become this virtual warrior-like woman determined to raise her son to be the one man that could save humankind from extinction. Along with Linda, actor Michael Biehn (""Aliens"") created a very human, yet at times almost superhuman hero in Sarah's protector, Kyle Reese. His devotion to not only his mission, but also to Sarah, was a nice twist to the character, because it made him into a much more realistic hero. Normally in movies like this the hero is one that knows exactly what to do in every situation, and nine times out of ten Kyle was very much like that, but there were those moments where he clearly was flying by the seat of his pants, and just hoping for some miracle to occur to save both him and Sarah from the machine hunting them; it was this very human aspect to his heroic character that made him stand out more than what your typical action hero would have in any other movie.

Lastly, writer/director James Cameron did an excellent job of creating a visually thrilling science fiction experience with a significantly smaller budget than anything produced in movies or television today, and yet still his visuals hold up better than most from that time. That is as much to do with the excellent work on behalf of James Cameron and his crew as it is with the talented people working with Stan Winston to create the stunning, yet sometimes frightening images of a future where machines rule over the humans with an iron fist. Granted there are moments within the film where it definitely shows its age, and the practical and visual effects definitely look dated; however, given the time at which the film was made the results are still impressive even by today's standards if you really stop to think about it. It would be nice (and I'm sure purists will disagree with me on this) if some of the weaker moments in the visual effects area could be tweaked/redone similar to what George Lucas did to his original Star Wars trilogy. I'm not saying to tweak the effects to the extent that George did, but there are definitely places where if an improvement could be made the movie would definitely benefit from it, and would feel more in line with the technological advancements made in between this first movie and its sequels.

Overall, ""The Terminator"" is an excellent science fiction thrill ride that grabs you early on, and only occasionally slows down long enough for you to catch your breath before quickly rushing forward once more. With an outstanding story, a surprising cast, and mostly solid visual effects work, this is a movie that kicked off one of the greatest sci-fi movie series' of all time, and should definitely be on everyone's must see list!

2135491,5,B0002WYTWG,"Some films age like wine: the older they get, the better they get. It's hard to believe that the Terminator's pushing 25 years old. Terminator's lean script, staccato editing and direction, and its human driven storyline are what allows it to survive amongst modern films that benefit from superior technologies like CGI, motion capture, and now 3D-motion photography. Everything's relative and, in 1984, Terminator's special effects were extraordinary.  For instance, there's a scene in a motel where the Terminator attends to some gunshot wounds he suffered. Using a box-knife, he opens a vaginal gash on his forearm to readjust a broken piston rod.  Then, he stabs the box-knife into his eyeball and plucks the soft gelatin organ out of his head. In the ragged and empty mouth of his eye-socket, a hard shiny light zooms in and out. This was scary back in 1984. Today, a five-year old could see through these transparent effects.

Distilled to its essence, the Terminator is a cyborg from the future that travels back in time--forty years--to kill a woman, a waitress, whose unborn son will save mankind in near the future. This is the magic of the Terminator: it's a human story.  The action, the special effects, the camerawork, the actors---the special effects in Terminator takes a back seat to its human storyline.

Terminator is James Cameron's best movie. It has the perfect atmosphere; most of the action is at night. The big `70's cars in the Terminator's chase sequences are reminiscent of the big cars in The French Connection's chase sequences.  Unlike T2, where there's a lot of exposition between action scenes, Terminator's action scenes erupt out of nowhere. I could go on and on but the bottom line is that Terminator will be around long after most of today's science fiction rip-offs are obsolete.

I want to warn every potential purchaser of the Blu-ray version, however, of the fact that it does not provide anything close to HD imagery as a result of the deterioration of the original film stock over the past 25 years.

2135494,2,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 is one of the best movies ever made. It has inspired novels, comic books, games, two more sequels (one of which is in production), and a TV series (The Sarah Connor Chronicles, which is my favorite show since Firefly). Needless to say, this is a film who's greatness is never to be doubted.

Unfortunately, this Blu-Ray disc is crap. It uses the old MPEG2 video encoder, so the picture quality is not what it ought to be on this format. The special features are absolutel bare bones, which is a darned shame since Extreme Edition and Ultimate Edition were both loaded up with lots of great goodies for fans to dig into. I would have settled for just getting the content from those two releases here in standard definition, just because they were so thorough and complete. Sadly, we get none of that here.

The worst sin that this disc commits of all though, is that it does not include the special extended version. The extended cut of T2 is the definitive version of the movie-- once you've seen it, there's really no reason to go back and watch the original theatrical version. There was a load of good stuff that got added to the extended cut, and a lot of it was very important for the story. Whoever put this crappy Blu-Ray disc together obviously made it with the intention of double dipping in the future. If you must watch T2 in high definition now, then I won't stop you from buying it. However, be warned that in a few months it's bound to become a coaster when they put out a brand new version containing the extended cut, immaculate picture quality, and loads of special features.

2135497,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 is one of the most memorable movies ever made. You can go years without watching this, but remember almost every scene when you finally see it again. This is real close to being a masterpiece, and it probably is. The special effects for the movie are still amazing even by today's standards. To me, the most memorable scene is when Sarah has the vision of the city being blown away, only leave skeletons in a fiery inferno. It is a really scary and somewhat realistic scene of what could happen to us if we aren't careful in the future. Not that machines will cause our demise, but we ourselves will. That is the message of the movie, that violence is ""in our nature"".

The story is incredible. The Terminator becomes the dad that John never had and you really feel it while watching. The acting is also great and the end of the movie is a real tear jerker. This is a have-to-see movie if you haven't seen it already. This movie is so big, it's weird if you haven't seen it yet. You've been missing out. For those who have seen it, this is the movie to get and you will love it as much as you always have.

A lot of the praise goes to Schwarzenegger, but Micahel Biehn makes for an excellent hero as Kyle Reese. His dialogue and scenes like when he is being interrogated by the police make the movie. I have to admit that the end of the movie when we see the Terminator as his true skeletal self, it still gives me the creeps. Just him walking and almost making it through the door before they close it is really terrifying.

Michael Biehn plays Kyle Reese(the soldier sent throught time to protect Sarah Conner(Linda Hamilton) from the Terminator(Arnold Shwarzenegger). There's action and drama all throughout the film.
Michael and Linda are the best actors. Most of the words said are done by them because The Terminator doesn't say much. The music by Brad Fiedel is great. Without the music, this film wouldn't be so popular.

2135511,5,B0002WYTWG,"With VHS there was always a fairly visible vapor that affected the film.  With DVD we saw a new image.  With Blu-Ray the vapor is eliminated, and the image is heightened to the point that you can see every flaw.  This is the case with most older films that are given the High Def treatment.  Terminator 1 and 2 are no different.  Please watch Independence Day and tell me that ever effect is goofy looking in HD.  The fact is our films under HD are starting to look like those old black and white sci-fi movies we told our parents looked like crap, and we doubted out they could ever fear the Creature From the Black Lagoon.

I, however, am a realist.  I get quite excite when I watch a Blu-Ray and can see the flaws.  From dirty windows in the Bourne Series, to the Jittery movement of the De-Swartzenegger'd Terminator.  T-1000s special effects were amazing originally, but now, almost 20 year later, it looks... well, matted.  Because let's face it... they are.

Blu-Ray is going to age your films.  Allowing us to see every inch of the movie, all 1080 of it, and is going to also show blemishes, bumps, bruises, and might open the door to a more romanesque interpretation of the artform, instead of the Athenian idealism that preceeded this age.  The reason why this statement is fact is that the entertainment industry is shuffling as we speak to design make-up that is HD safe.

My hope is that it is not.  All our favorite films are flawed.  I mean, after all, T1 and T2 do not star the great actor of all time.  Let's face it.  The name at the front of the credits is the first flaw.

T2:Blu Ray is the theatrical release with very little extras,the HD transfer isn't much better than the SD version. This version comes with the standard Blu Ray case.
T2:Ultimate Edition DVD has three versions of the film plus it's loaded with extras on the second disc. You can spend days going through all the extras on the second disc and if you hit a wrong button on your remote the terminator will threaten you. This version has the easter egg(82997) that allows you to view the directors cut which in my opinion is the best version.

In Terminator 2, SkyNet tries again, this time with Schwarzenegger's Terminator character playing the role of protector.

Considering that this film was made in the early 90's, I was astounded by the quality of the transfer.

*Tons of excellent action scenes, and lots of great special effects.
*Good filming style.  Not as fresh as the first ""Terminator,"" but still memorable.
*Good continuing story.  Much more complex than the first film.
*Stronger focus on the destructive nature of humanity.
*Great lines.
*Still good characters.  Still great acting.  In fact, the terminator is a stronger character in this one.
*Even though much of it is serious, there is also quite a bit of comedy throughout.  There is also less violence, making the film a little less stark or brutal.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*Ummmm....

While not as fresh, original, or serious as the first film, this sequel is just as essential.  The action and special effects are much more enjoyable.  The story and characters continue to be great, if not better.  On top of it all, it is as thought-provoking as the first, if not moreso.

Its simple premise is executed effectively, leaving lots of room for strong characters, gripping action, and some good emotional moments.

I've just re-watched it for the first time in ten years and none of the elements that made it so good in the 1980's have really dated at all. Sure there are no mobile phones to assist Sarah Conner, and the stop motion photography near the end betrays the films relatively low budget, but all in all its a roller coaster ride that takes some beating.

The first hour is relentless action with a high degree of tension as well. If by chance you've never seen it before you are really won't be sure who wants to kill Sarah Conner. Of course if you've seen T2 first you may be even more confused....

Schwarzenegger was made for this role, and the idea of him being a cyborg with real flesh is entirely believable. If theres one criticsm of the film its perhaps that they should have dubbed a different voice (a bit like they did with Dave Prowse in Star Wars) when The Terminator speaks.

Credit must go to James Cameron the director, who was responsible for so many quality Action/Sci-fi/Horror films in the 80's and early 90's. Sadly Cameron hasn't maintained that standard and since directing Titanic (which itself wasn't that good and was 10 years ago now) hasn't made another as good as The Terminator.",1203811200,,1349,4.4534412955465585

The central theme of the movie is the value of human life; it sets itself up well and is an example of Director James Cameron's finest works (another being Titanic (1997)).

I would have much preferred the film be cleaned up and spruced up more, but my conclusion is that the blu ray is definitely better than the DVDs.

2135567,5,B0002WYTWG,"This may be the greatest science fiction film ever made.  In my opinion there should have been no sequels to it.  It was a perfect story in this single film.  No more was required.

The future is bleak, filled with destruction and genocide at the hands of the machines.  The Terminators are cybernetic organisms with the purpose of finding, and destroying, humans wherever they are found.

The special effects in this film have mixed results.  Some are still very well done.  Others are obviously dated to the 80s.  Despite that flaw this is the perfect sci-fi story.  Time travel, evil machines and robots, nuclear holocaust, murder, and one human being who must survive in order for the human race to survive the terror of the rise of the machines.

So many ""sci-fi"" films are so crummy that they give the sci-fi fans little to enjoy and the viewers have to leave much of what they watch to their own imaginations.  Not so with The Terminator.  It is a fully realized visual story and I give it 5 stars for it's impact on the science fiction genre.

However sony also made this mistake with their release of  the fifth element and then recalled the first edition and put out a proper cleaned up release.  Warner brothers needs to do the same with this one.  Lets just hope that no other movies get released on blu ray with tear and wear lines down the center of the picture.

2135571,3,B0002WYTWG,"Not reviewing the movie (which I give 5 stars) only the quality of the Blu-ray disc version. As a number of people have already stated the quality is not very good. It is slightly better than regular DVD but seriously needs to be remastered and re-released. There is tons of graininess, just look at a paused screen. Most close-up scenes had a better quality but still nowhere near other high definition movies. Some people incorrectly assume that older movies will be of a lower quality simply due to age but that is not accurate. There are plenty of old films that are fantastic in HD such as The Warriors (1979), 2001 (1968 - though filmed in 70mm), and even Casablanca (1942). All these films are amazing in HD. What makes the biggest difference is how well stored and cared for the masters are. But even still with today's technologies a lot can be done to improve a less than stellar master. I suspect someday they will remaster and re-release this movie just like they did with The Fifth Element which looked no better than DVD originally but now looks phenomenal in the remastered version.

So, don't expect this movie to be reborn on Blu-ray cause it simply isn't. It is however better than DVD and the deleted scenes, as bad as they were, were interesting to watch. I don't recall ever having seen this film with surround sound and it was a great experience in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.",1200528000,,1396,4.606425702811245

2135574,1,B0002WYTWG,"This movie has been one of my favorites. I owned it on laser disc in the early 90's.  It looked superb and sharp on my 32"" TV. Turns out maybe the reason it looked so crisp back then was because 450 lines of resolution was about the limit of what could be seen.

When I rented it on Blu-ray and played it, I couldn't believe my eyes.  It appears that it was not filmed on the highest quality film stock.  It looks slightly soft at times and just plain undefined.  Not razor sharp and prestine.  The opening nighttime battle scene is one example. The T-1000's arrival under the bridge is another, and Arnold's arrival next to the big rig trucks is yet another example. Yet the daytime scenes in sunlight some look a bit better.  That includes the scene with the two kids going to the bank's ATM.

INTERESTING DVD COMPARISON - I have the same movie on DVD.  I played it in the Blu-ray player which upconverted it.  It looks ALMOST the same as the HD version. This movie is only slightly better in HD at best. I've seen older movies than this one that look  much more detailed.

The best part about this disc is the redesigned main menu graphics and the updated 2003 commentary featuring the director. THAT'S IT.

BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see what Blu-ray can do, this movie is NOT the one to get.

UPDATE 2/2011: I newer version of the movie called the ""Skynet Edition"" was released on Blu-ray in 2009.  It's much better than the original 2006 Blu-ray and higher quality than a upscaled DVD.  Not razor-edge sharp but very clean and crisp.",1199664000,,1540,4.407801418439717

2135577,4,B0002WYTWG,"As far as action movies go T2:JD is IT, it's got explosions, shooting, and 'Ahnold shwarshnaygah'! (pun intended, yes I spelled his name wrong on purpose!) Unlike other action movies, T2 includes charracter development, character depth, intricate plot and (suprisingly) a moral statement.

The acting is by far the best thing in the film, every role is played to the point that you have to surrender to the movie's will that these are not just characters, these people are 'REALITY' *. The visual effects are another great for this film, the effects are astounding, well not nowadays, but for back then, these were beyond just a 'breakthrough'.

though this movie is not without it's flaws.......

(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)

At the climax, the movie succumbs to ""stupid bad guy, and plot devices"", here, let me explain: The entire movie, the bad guy has been running himself to death to kill John Connor, he can transform his arms and fingers into huge blades, which can apparently expand a decent length. He can also run at superhuman speeds, he can also imitate peoples body and voice to trick people into traps. Now, at the end of the film, he has connor within 30 feet of him, and all he does is walk 'SLOWLY' toward him (I'm guessing this was for suspense, but the effect was stupid). And of course, due to the Terminator's sluggishness, he easily runs away, while his mom stays behind for reasons I can't fathom (she had ages to get away herself).

Once the Terminator reaches Johns mom, he turns his finger into a long blade and impales her through the shoulder, he tells her to call for John, she resists, this sequence goes on for a minute, this entire time, I'm saying to myself, ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL HER, TRANSFORM INTO HER AND CALL FOR JOHN!!!!"", of course he does this later, but of course, then somebody comes to save John and bla bla bla.

(SPOILERS END)

Another thing that might turn off some veiwers is that you can't really relate to anybdy in this movie. One person's bad boy middle-school kid with rotten foster parents who he's stuck with(some may be able to relate to this, but most probably won't be watching this movie), one's a woman who's trapped in a mental hospital, one's a scientist on the verge of a world-changing discovery and one is a.. uh, robot.

Well, there you have it, a rough and tough action film with a kind of weak climax, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the story.

8.5/10  (probably would have been 9/10 if it weren't for that ending).

* The exception of this would have been the role of Edward Furlong, though this is somewhat excusable due to him being a child actor, his character is a bit less than beleiveable.",1199577600,,2670,4.6118143459915615
2135578,4,B0002WYTWG,"T3, was the first Terminator movie I saw, and I greatly enjoyed it. When I heard the first two were better, I bought both without watching them and I was satisfied. Though I will admit I'm a very tiny bit underwhelmed.

 though it was a good film, I don't believe it had the bang that I expected the movie to have due to it's large amounts of praise. It had a good amount of Arny action and shooting in there, lot's of running and what not, but it didn't contain the loud bang that an action film shuld have. In fact, it was styled a bit more like a horror film, just without the amount of scares. The acting was first-rate, as was the story and script, it's just not an action flick.

If you've been looking around for a good, dark, almost slasher-like film, then look no further, this is it.

8/10 good, compelling and thought provoking (though not in a peaceful way) a good film that's sets it's own standards.

Also, about the dvd cover. People, it says Lenticular COVER Edition, if you were looking for something more with the dvd itself, then you should have investigated more then look at the title which says COVER in it and think it contains more.",1199577600,,1156,4.358139534883721

In doing research for this review, I was surprised to learn that Arnold was not the first choice to play the protagonist.

Mel Gibson was the first choice, but turned it down (he thought it just a rehash oh his Mad Max movies)

O.J. Simpson was considered, but was turned down, because he had a nice guy image (boy how that has changed).

Anyhow, I rememberber thinking, after I saw this movie for the first time.  ""WOW, how do you kill this thing?""

Ok I have to say this is a Perfect Transfer for a 1980s movie on B-Ray.
Picture is so real it felt like they made it 2 months ago. (There was only 2 picture greyness when Arnie is in the hotel room Patching his eyeball and at the end when he gets blown up in the truck and transforms in the cyborg. I guess not much can be done there especially when it's a Model.
Apart from that 100% perfect picture and not to mention the sound: much sharper then the special edition DVD which had some faults.

2135586,5,B0002WYTWG,"TERMINATOR 2  DVD

The true beauty of TERMINATOR 2 is its undying loyalty and respect for its predecessor, made some eight years before. Even though there was such a gap in time, Cameron remained faithful to his original production, which translates into a seamless and believable sequel. The T-800 machine, the nemesis in the original ""Terminator,"" returns, only this time the cyborg has been programmed to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), now a pre-adolescent. And once again, Schwarzenegger was made for the role of the T-800: a stoic, hulking, violent killing machine, yet this time, Arnold brings a discreet sense of humor and compassion to the part.
Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, young mother of John, but now she's buffed and tough and ready to fight back. And Robert Patrick is exceptional as the advanced T-1000 Model, the machine programmed to kill John--a machine so advanced it makes the T-800 look like an old Commodore PC. The action, the effects, the story, is spellbinding, but again, the subtle and not-so-subtle parallels to the original ""Terminator"" are what impressed me the most.
Highly recommended for fans of Arnold, the Terminator, and Science Fiction movies.

2135587,5,B0002WYTWG,"As some of our more avid fans have noticed, Sid the Elf is branching his reviews out to reach a more diverse sampling of film. We have found that Sci-fi is quite enjoyable eventhough most of the genre's fans are complete losers who live in their mothers' basements, weigh at least two-and-a-half bills, and have multiple computers(one of which is loaded and overrun with viruses if you get the drift. When you think Sci-fi, one of the films that pops to mind is T2. In the 90's it was the big budget action movie, starring The Immortal Arnold Schwarzenegger and written by James Cameron.  Yeah, the same dude who did Titanic. If you could get inside info on things like ""Did Arnold threaten Cameron's life on-set, or did he just call him an emasculating name?"" wouldn't that make a better feature on the DVD than ""Oh, so that's how they made that dude appear right out of the floor? That's pretty cool."" Oh, boy!

But, this movie was totally awesome. You had many soundboard lines to laugh at just because of The Arnold Voice. You had tons of cool explosions. You had a lot of sweet guns and explosives. You got to make fun of Sarah Connor because she was absolutely nuts. Pretty much everything you would want in a great guy movie, except for hot chicks. Oh well, you can't have everything. The concept was sweet. You had Arnold who was a now obselete Terminator, if there even is such a thing, assigned to protect John Connor. However, John and his mother, Sarah Connor, are being hunted by another, updated Terminator. Now, Arnold was made out of metal, so he could be crushed or something. But, this other dude was made out of liquid or something. So if you shot him, this giant hole would open up then start to close immediately. Awesome! How is Arnold going to take this thing on?

Because he's Arnold. That's why. If you learn anything reading Sid's reviews, learn this: Arnold is the man. He is undefeatable and undeniable. We wish he could be president. So, on Sid the Elf's recomendation, watch Terminator 2. You will absolutely love it.",1196121600,,2047,4.587431693989071

There is virtually no difference between this and a standard release.  Trust me after a couple minutes you're looking hard for a reason why you just paid $25 for a DVD and when you can't find anything of consequence you're gonna be disappointed.

But,one day,things take a sudden and dangerous turn around the corner for Sarah Conner. This is when Sarah Conner discovers that she is the target of The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger),a cyborg from the future that has been sent from time to assasinate her. The reason for this? To save the future by changing the past,in order to prevent Sarah Conner's future son John from being the only hope of mankind.

Now,on the run from danger,Sarah Connor only has one real aide and help throughout the disastorous and terrifying event she finds herself going through. Who is that real aide and help? A cyborg by the name of Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn),who,before he knows it,will be through a lot more than just protecting Sarah Conner.

""The Terminator"" is one of the most richly executed films every made. The plot for ""The Terminator"" is very creative,and is skillfully and carefully brought to life by director James Cameron. Throughout ""The Terminator"",James Cameron cleverly tackles both science fiction and action. His take on both science fiction and action appropriately and entertaingly represent both of the two genres,without going overboard in any way,shape,or form. The character chemistry in ""The Terminator"" is impeccable,and balances out ""The Terminator"" well,contributing to the goodness of the film. The beauty of ""The Terminator""? Unlike most films similiar to it,you really don't know who will win:the good side,or the bad side.

It is also worth noting that ""The Terminator"" does deliver some very strong acting. In Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's performances as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese,Hamilton and Biehn make a perfect onscreen team. Their take of the action succeeds in going along with the story,not trying to be action stars and being able to maintain the limnits. The chemistry in the script for ""The Terminator"" is intelligently brought to life by Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn,and keeps the heat up throughout the film. Also,despite the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger will never be taken seriously as an actor,Schwarzenegger's performance as The Terminator is nothing but brilliance. As The Terminator,Arnie keeps one wondering what will happen next,and makes the suspense of the film both entertaining and chilling. Add everything together,and you have the perfect film that posseses the qualities of a perfect and successful film.

As for this DVD version of ""The Terminator"",the lenticular cover is very cool. It is something that any hardcore fan of ""The Terminator"" will appreciate. But,considering the fact that the only bonus feautures here are the original theatrical trailer for ""The Terminator"" and DVD-Rom script to screen(which you have to access with your computer,with only two computer programs being accessible),you may just want to buy the DVD version of this film that comes without the lenticular cover.

From the plot standpoint, this is the only Terminator movie that could have worked without Arnie. And maybe this is not a coincidence, it probably was conceived that way.

That being said, it is great to have Arnie back, because when the first part had him act like a (pretty scary) machine, here he is in a way more human than in most of his other roles where he plays actual humans.

One could almost be a bit nostalgic for the time when Hollywood could still produce carefully thought-out blockbusters that rocked and even had a bit of wit. Watching ""Die Hard 4"" a few weeks ago was a good reminder how deeply the American film industry has fallen since then.

As far as the extra features on the DVD are concerned, I am grateful that James Cameron did not include that horrible sugar-coated coda in the theater version. It would have single-handedly wiped out the whole movie, it is so cringe-inducing. (Yes, even more cringe-inducing than Arnold's acting and the occasional bad SFX.)

In ""Terminator 2"", Cameron gives us great action scenes, punctuated by slower, more dialogue-heavy scenes. The film is long because it takes its time to draw its characters, and it does not rush to its conclusion but lets us savor it.

A few things look a bit ridiculous of course, like the obvious puppet of Arnie when he walks towards the cops at Cyberdyne while being shot at and that determinedly downtempo synthesizer music in some of the action scenes sometimes is a little embarrassing. Most cell phones can probably synthesize better sound today. But that does not detract from the accomplishment of the movie, which is built on character, situation, and a solid understanding of pacing.",1185235200,,2322,5.1485411140583555

2135612,4,B0002WYTWG,"I bought the DVD in order to watch the Hi-Def version. I already have the older version of the movie, and I've seen it many times over the years. I have an HP laptop running Windows Vista, hooked up to my 50"" Panasonic HDTV (1280x720), with the VGA connection. I loaded the disk, and it prompted me to install the InterActual player. Vista warned me that the program has issues with the new operating system. I went ahead, and installed it anyway, then immediately downloaded the newest version from the Internet. It then told me that I needed a DVD decoder that I could buy on their web page. I ignored that message, and went on to play the HD version of the movie. It played OK, after some initial stuttering during the first few screens.

The picture quality was very good, but the audio was not Dolby Digital 5.1, meaning that there is no surround sound. I followed up on the InterActual web page, and they confirmed this. Apparently, Microsoft used some other audio encoding. So, even though the picture quality is better, I chose to watch the lower definition, extended edition in order to get the DD5.1 sound. I find the sound quality is at least as important as the video quality.

The standard definition image is still very good. The nVidia chip set in my laptop does a nice job of upscaling. The 5.1 sound is spectacular as ever. The added minutes in the extended edition don't really add much, but the novelty effect is nice anyway. All in all, I'd say that it is worth the price at under $10.00.",1182211200,,1508,4.5
2135613,5,B0002WYTWG,"It's no surprise that the editors of ""Entertainment Weekly"" would choose both ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and ""Aliens"" as two of its 25 Best Action Films of all time.  Both are sequels that significantly up the special effects ante, along with the body count, and both feature two of the movies most dynamic kick-[...] heroines, Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton"" in the former and Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the latter.

Besides doubling the action of the first, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" also doubles the cyborg quotient by returning Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role that he was born to play (this time as a ""good"" cyborg) and bringing in a more than equal combatant/foe in the from of the Robert Patrick as an ""upgraded"" model.  The movie adds an element of surprise in the form of the much smaller (and less developed) Patrick as a superior model to Arnold's character, able to best the strongman in many a scene.

The movie also brings back Earl Boen in an expanded role as the befuddled ""Dr. Silberman.""  He brings needed comic relief in a film that is short on words but long on action sequences.

James Cameron may have felt on ""top of the world"" a decade later with his Oscar-winning ""Titanic"" but it is for the first two ""Terminator"" films that he probably made his greatest cinematic impact.",1181952000,,1310,4.774336283185841
2135614,5,B0002WYTWG,"Entertainment Weekly recently touted the first sequel (""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") to this film as being one of The Twenty-Five Best Action Films of all time.  That title may be an accurate assessment of the non-stop action of the sequel but what would it have been without its predecessor which ranks as one of the best science fiction commentaries on the path that we may be going with our computer-dependent society.

James Cameron scored a casting coup when he gave the role to Arnold.  At the time, the muscle-bound actor had had a few films under his belt, films that played mostly on his physical appearance and his novice acting skills.  ""The Terminator"" character was short on dialogue but Cameron made the best of his star by providing him with one-line zingers and stares that could wake the dead.

To call the part ""tailor-made"" for Schwarzenegger would be a major understatement.  He was muy perfecto.

Linda Hamilton, not yet the household name that she would become for TV's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" as well as not yet the future ""Mrs. James Cameron,"" is appropriately confused and terrified as the waitress that would ultimately become the mother of the man that would rescue humanity.

Michael Biehn is well-cast as the other traveler from the future, intent on preventing Arnold's malevolent cyborg from doing his killing-thing.

2135624,5,B0002WYTWG,"Since I'm a HUGE Terminator freak (I've read ALL of the books I could get my hands on about the Terminator series),I also know the history of this movie and it's rather quite interesting:

 James Cameron actually made this movie after he had a nightmare about a killer robot from the future and from there, he created one of my favorite movies of all time; The Terminator (T2 was FAR superior but that's another story).

 Before they starting filming they actually wanted Arnold to be the good guy but once he read the script for Cyberdyne System's Model 101 (or better known as the Terminator) Mr. Cameron decided to put him as the killer robot.

 James Cameron called his good friend Stan Winston to be apart of the film (Stan Winston is an AMAZING special effects artist; he also did work for another film starring Arnold; Predator), he drew up the skeleton for CSM-101.

 At the time Linda Hamilton was dating James Cameron; he put her in the main role of Sarah Connor and the rest is history.

The story goes like this; in August 21, 1997 Cyberdyne launched nuclear warheads at Russia, and after mankind was nearly wiped out thanks to the nuclear winter, there was another war; a war against the machines.

 John Connor decided to launch a rebellion against the machines but the war must be fought in the past before John is born.

 Cyberdyne decided to send a machine back into the past to kill the mother of John Connor back in 1984, but along with the machine comes John's father Kyle Reese to help Sarah and to help train her into becoming the soldier of the future so she can train her son into the man that he is going to become.

The movies are VERY INTERESTING to me and I'm not into sci-fi at all but I LOVE The Terminator series and everything that is associated with it, so if you haven't seen it yet (God knows where you have been if you haven't seen this movie yet) or just want to catch a really good flick this is the movie for you.",1179532800,,1952,4.401114206128134

Terminator's mission is to go back in time and kill Sarah Connor, thereby preventing John Connor from being the leader of the resistance forces that would destroy Skynet.

Often, science horror could be called true science fiction, because it is based on what could happen.  However, true science fiction is focused more on the possibilities and human reaction, while the purpose of a science horror movie is to terrify you.  This movie will terrify you.

This movie does an excellent job with its twists and turns in the plot; you will jump at least once by the time the movie is over.  Schwarzenegger is excellent as the villain, and Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn turn in good performances.  It also has a small role by Beth Motta, who I remember as being an exercise instructor for 20 Minute workout, an exercise program.

Similar mechanical giants have been lumbering out of space-ships ever since...

In ""Devil Girl from Mars,"" the giant refrigerator robot Chai hunts for virile Scotsmen and find John Laurie, while in 'Target Earth,' the Venusian robots imitate Gort in projecting rays from their heads but take the idea a step further and make the rays lethal...

In Stanley Kubrick's 'mythological documentary,' HAL 9000 computer is the most human character in the movie... But in James Cameron's breakthrough feature, there is, indeed, 'a storm coming in.' His 'Terminator' is a systematic metal, 'surrounded by living tissue,' an invulnerable cyborg, part man, part machine, with whom 'it can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.'

The film opens with two naked men appearing in two different parts of Los Angeles' darkened streets... One is tall and powerfully built, the other is compact and muscular... Both men seek the same person, a small and delicate blond woman by the name of Sarah Connor...

Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrifying as the 'killer cyborg' who 'looks like Death rendered in steel.' He has searched the phone book and brutally shot to death other unfortunate women who bear the same name... He is sent back from the future to present-day (1984) to kill the mother of an unborn enemy...

Schwarzenegger moves with inhuman speed bounding like a panther, scanning methodically with dominated blue eyes his surroundings, and in a perfect simulation of voice, he is on the track of his victim... He examines his weapons with precise movements, drives expressionlessly, and kills without pity, or remorse, or fear... It is a role that suits his talent perfectly...

Michael Biehn seems scared by traumas of others wars... His face outlines a long burn scar... He tries to stop Schwarzenegger's attempts to be carried out... He is sinister in his long coat... His whole life has been combat... He identifies himself as Reese, a soldier from the future, assigned to protect Sarah at all costs... For him it is an honor, a chance to meet the legend... We feel his pain and anguish when he said: 'That terminator is out there. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!'

Linda Hamilton is quiet convincing as the strong innocent prey, targeted for termination, momentarily disoriented, vaguely disturbed... She feels a blind panic boiling up within her, a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine... She is in a daze, paralyzed, shivering silently, uncontrollably... Her fragile personality disguises a hidden force she did't know she had...

Cameron makes a successful move behind the lens in one of the most breathtaking modern action science fiction films...",1168732800,,2971,5.136645962732919
2135645,4,B0002WYTWG,"A strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a figure in a sphere of energy... It is the figure of a naked man... 'Terminator' has come through... He stands, and impassively surveys its surroundings...

His physique is massive and perfect... His face devoid of emotion... He's not here to kill Sara Connor... His mission now is to protect the future savior of mankind, her son John... Thirty years from now, Terminator was reprogrammed to be John Connor's protector here, in this time... Terminator would never leave him... Terminator would never hurt him... Terminator would die to defend him against any danger...

But Skynet, the computer which controlled the Machines, sent an advanced prototype back through time, to destroy the leader of the human Resistance, little John...

T-1000 is very menacing... His features are handsome bordering on severe... Its face is simple, unformed... His eyes are gray ice, penetrating... He is certainly not built like Terminator with complex hydraulics and cables... He is human-shaped but far from human...

Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the super-hero... He never threatens, that's a human thing! He just takes... He can jerk any knife out without slowing a stride... His hand blurs out like a striking cobra...

We watch him smashing the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand... And when the bullets rake his chest, he doesn't even draw back... We observe him in slow motion how he fights for control, how he jumps his bike, sweeps a street kid off his machine with one arm and swings him in front of him...

Robert Patrick is a super-villain, a perfect chameleon... He can change shape and color... He can imitate anything it touches, anything it samples by physical contact, any object of equal size...

He is a 'killing machine' with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society... He looks and acts exactly like a 'cop' but with quite a few surprises... His arms and fingers can be turned smoothly into something else... He spins at a sound... His blow is lighting fast... He pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol... He is cool, alert, confident in his power... His expression emotionless and judgmental...

Linda Hamilton is not a mission priority... She is the same woman we remember from last time... Her body is straight and taut... Her arms are lean and muscular... Her eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered animal... Her voice is a low and chilling monotone... Her expression cold and impassive... She is defiant and intense... She looks hard...

Hamilton seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.. She draws her knife from its belt sheath, and idly starts to carve something on the table top, the letter ""N."" Something changes in her eyes... Her face is an impassive mask... We see the forces at war behind her eyes... She has become a 'Terminator,' intending to change the future somehow...

Edward Furlong is young John Connor... He is a ten-year tough delinquent, targeted for termination... He has short yellowish hair and a sullen mouth... His eyes reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel... His interactions with his 'protector' give the movie effective moments of psychological depth...

He reluctantly shows his friend a shot of his mother, pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border... John doesn't know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years, and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in time to become his father...

Joe Morton is Miles Dyson, the star of the Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation... He is a man in a hurry, a man with much to do... He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.. In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor... He can be the man most directly responsible for 3 billion deaths on August 29th, 1997... The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day, will live only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Machines...

His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching terror... This is a man ripped out of normal life into a grim world... He looks up, through his pain and incomprehension, and asks himself: Why is this nightmare happening?

The level of violence in Cameron's film is pretty intense... The special effects are outstanding... They look realistic... The action scenes are amazing, very well executed... James Cameron tries to provide a message of peace... The music score is almost perfect... The plot is intriguing... The motion picture features excellent performances...

'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is a blazing big-budget sci-fi thriller, very creative, to be entirely experienced... A definite must-see movie...",1168732800,,4819,4.946782178217822

I remember seeing this movie when I was little on my recorded straight from TV VHS tape, and playing it over and over again until the tape wore out. I watched again over the weekend on blueray and I was amazed at the clarity of the transfer, the saturation of the colors and the punch of the soundtrack.

You do have to be aware of one thing though. If you are playing blueray movies using your Playstation 3, and do not have an HD TV with an input capable of taking in a 1080i signal (at least), the playstation will send a 480p signal instead of downconverting to 720p. That is because all bluerays are native 1080p, and the playstation seems incapable of downcoverting the signal (for now) to 720p.

I have a Samsung DLP TV, and its true native resolution is 720p, therefore i told my PS3 to always send a 720p signal to my TV. Well, when I played Terminator instead of sending a high def signal to my TV, it sent a 480p signal, making the quality of the movie no better than DVD. I was confused and thought the blueray looked crappy, but it reality it was the signal that was crappy. I told my PS3 to send a 1080i signal, and this time the blueray finally came to life. Even though my TV is native 720p resolution, it is capable to taking a 1080i signal and showing it.

I watched the blu ray version at a friends house, brought over my T2 Extreme edition, played it on his computer next to the HDTV, and compared the two.  There was hardly any difference and if there was the hat went off to the computer version.

Why do I mention this?  Because this blu ray is over priced and has nothing for extras.  You want the best version of T2 you can buy?

Take a Look at this film, if the terminator had killed everybody in the film, and returned to his era, this film would be among the most courageous, intelligent, creative ever. But again the poor director did the choice of impossible, a truly skinny and dumb girl killing that massive future man, and is always the same thing, the same dumb endings, I think that the demagogy of the directors conducted them to this. Imagine one thing, that robot coming, killing every people that deserve to, with absolute no remorse, and coming back, wow, what a film. But this kind of weak and feminist weak moral as in this film always put to the ground even good ideas. But I'm an optimistic and I hope one day one really intelligent director will be brave of creating a film with a male intelligent perspective of a possibility of human total destruction with no (liar, impossible) chance to the weak people.

  Before I begin, I must say that James Cameron has done an incredible job directing the first two Terminator movies.

  Terminator 1 is the basis for the next two sequels, just watch it and note how well the plot, action and Kyle's emotional flashbacks blend together. No time is wasted in this movie, no emotion rushed, and no action is made without meaningful cause.

  This may even be the most perfect sci-fi movie ever created, it may not have the glossy effects of T2 or T3, but that is not to say it is any worse than those two films...actually I find the first Terminator movie to be the best of the three...it has stronger acting, more thrilling chases and an overall darker, more chilling feel.

All the chase scenes are at night...actually most of the movie is aswell, and I find that to suit the movie very well and I must not forget to mention the soundtrack...it is absolutely dark and chaotic.

Without any doubt in my mind I can honestly say that this is the most touching one of the Terminator movies.",1158969600,,1339,4.469135802469136

2135664,5,B0002WYTWG,"The T2: Ultimate Edition DVD came out 6 years ago when the DVD format was still gaining in popularity and yet it still remains one of the finest single movie DVD editions of them all. Skip the later Extreme Edition which was only released to capitalize on the much anticipated arrival of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in theaters. Buy the Extreme Edition only if you want to hear the James Cameron/William Wisher commentary track.

Back to T2: Ultimate Edition, this baby is loaded top to bottom with features, commentaries, clips, an alternate ending, an entire screenplay and a total breakdown of every facet of the film's production, from pre-production to marketing and release strategy. Yes, like a total film school in one shiny case. You better believe the case is shiny, Artisan actually relased this DVD in a metal slip cover initially, that's right, real metal! Talk about doing things the right way.

Now for the movie, you get both the theatrical cut and the special edition. Although you may want to view the special edition once in a while, if you're a true movie buff, you'll realize the utter superiority of the theatrical film. It is James Cameron's real vision, after all. He has stated this on many occasions. The theatrical version is better paced, tighter and just flows wonderfully, it's perfection. The special edition version is more bloated in it's running time obviously and these scenes don't add much value to the film but they do take away from it. For instance Arnold grinning like some ugly horse? Yeesh!

T2, the theatrical cut, is a sci-fi masterpiece of epic proportions and all the talk about it's advancement of digital technology, it's state of the art special-effects will never transcend the fact that it's a truly well told story with rounded, developed characters personified by actors giving very good performances. This film is an example to lazy, idea lacking filmmakers everywhere. Even if you are going to do a 'genre' film, have the audacity to take the genre and your ideas seriously so you can elevate your work beyond the limitations of the inherent genre. James Cameron accomplished this task on more than one occasion. Here's a toast to you, Jim!",1156896000,,2203,4.885026737967914

The colors from the explosions, night scenes and steel mill look really good.  Big improvement over the old one.  The scenes where Arnold is shooting at the cops with the mini-gun, then grenade launcher, then the subsequent blowing up of the computer lab are wonderful in high-def with the sound cranked all the way up!

Let me summarize the reasons I am not satisfied with this product.

1) The HD windows media files require the installation of the Interactual player which is known and well documented spyware. We shouldn't be forced to install or use spyware to play HD content.

2) After I finally got the Interactual player to find and install a license for the video (the WMV uses DRM protection) I inspected the license and noticed it was only valid for 5 days. 5 days to play a movie I own??? I set the date on my machine forward by one week and, sure enough, the video was no longer playable. I set the date back and the video still wouldn't play (as expected).

Probably the best this film has ever sounded.  I was able to pick up background noise and nuances I never heard on VHS, Laserdisc, or standard DVD.  All in all, it is a modest transfer.

The difference here is that you almost begin to empathize with Brynner's obsession as if perhaps he wanted to have been created as a human being and not a robot.  Brynner does have his catharsis. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator has less aspirations and has only a singular purpose in this film.

As she struggles to make sense of the situation while fleeing for her life, Sarah is assisted by a soldier, also from the future, who volunteers to protect her and to help her fulfill her destiny.

I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. However, returning to the subject of this format it seems to be not what it was touted to be. Unfortunately this Blu-ray disc seems to bring out the imperfections from the master print or whatever print they used to copy THE TERMINATOR onto this disc.

2135682,4,B0002WYTWG,"The new Blu-Ray version of The Terminator is presented in a glorious 1080P 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. Although the film still suffers during the many night sequences, daytime sequences and close-ups look truly marvelous, and exhibit a depth of field and clarity that is rarely seen on a film of this age. The marring of the night sequences was present on the film in the theater, and it hasn't aged well. This not artifacting, nor is it any product of the transfer. Colors are rich and lifelike, and this really showcases how good HD can look.

Wow...that's all I can say on the audio front. The MGM DVD has been improved ten fold here, as the uncompressed PCM 5.1 track is truly revolutionary. Incredibly deep bass, active surrounds and dynamic front sound fields make for one of the best home theater experiences you can have. Gunshots usually sound weak and fake in 5.1 remixes of mono films; not here. The gunshots are loud, bassy and crisp, exactly as they should be. This genuinely sounds like a new 5.1 track, so big props to MGM's top-notch audio house.

The extras are sparse, but it does include a ""making of"" and several HD trailers including xXx and Underworld. The silly Java/Windows hourglass is still cracking me up on the Samsung BD-P1000, but that is not a reflection of the software, and so far I am equally as impressed as I am with HD-DVD.

Pros:

1- A successful sequel of a blockbuster T1 (check the votes).
2- A successful first use of computer animation technology (1991).

Cons:

1- More than 2 hours.
2- Noticeable difference between animatronics and animation.

I always fancied unstoppable killing machines that are believable and innovative. The T1000 liquid metal tops the list with its amazing ability to change shape and solidify at will. I even thought about the scientific feasibility of such a machine, but that only leads to contradiction with some scenes in the movie, like when Arnold shoots the T1000 to many pieces when it was frozen, you don't see a central module that supplies the energy to drive it, or an intelligence module (CPU) that contols it. And if it doesn't have a central module, then it would not need to see from its ""eyes"" or hear from its ""ears"", its entire body can be used to sense the world around it.

2135689,5,B0002WYTWG,"""Terminator II"" is an excellent movie with a lot of action. The film was well made with excellent sound and picture quality. I loved the action, comedy and excellent acting by the main stars, Arnold, Sarah, John and Patrick.

The storyline is that ten years ago, the machines that rule the future sent a Terminator to destroy the unborn John Connor. However, they had failed. Now a cyborg that can change its shape is sent back from the future to kill John Connor before he can grow up and lead the fight against the machines. This newer Terminator is more deadly. Its efforts are thwarted by a protector (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) whose duty is to save John and his mother Sarah.

This movie is one of the best box offices smashes of all time and with good reason. The action is non-stop and the special effects are out of this world. The ending could have been different.

2135698,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is one of the most important films of our time. James Cameron is a genius. I knew it then. And, of course, it's apparent to everyone now. James makes flawless films. Even taking into account the lack of high-tech special effects in the first Terminator compared to the wizardry we have today, you have to realize this is an all time great! This movie never loses it's punch or appeal---even twenty years later! James gives us a gutsy female heroine (Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor) long before they became popular. (Look at ''Charlie's Angels''.) But Cameron writes characters who are REAL. Who doesn't identify with Sarah Connor? The always underrated Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese is as superb as he is darling and appealing. Check out Bill Paxton (who would go on to be featured in and eventually star in more of Cameron's films) in the opening sequence as an unfortunate ''punk'' and his punk friends who meet the Terminator! And wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the single minded killing machine. Arnold and James make wonderful movies together. Who doesn't enjoy an Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi flick? As James Cameron has said about Arnold, (not exact quote)-He takes direction very well and can physically and emotionally do exactly as the director envisions. Arnold is just great and just keeps getting better. When I first saw this film, I told friends I thought that was funny when Arnold said ''I'll be back.'' It is a truly captivating line....I was right! That line became Arnold's most famous ''catch phrase''! You cannot miss seeing this movie and no home DVD/Video library should be without it! Yes, this movie is A#1 in my book-----exciting, frightening, riveting, romantic and unforgettable. If you don't love it, you're simply not a sci-fi movie lover. This one is the best of them all.

2135704,5,B0002WYTWG,"I used to think that ""Terminator 2"" was better than this one.  I guess it was because I thought the special effects were better, it wasn't as ""scary"", the cinametography was lighter and friendlier and there was more explosive action.  Lately, however, I have questioned that.

We all know the plot so I won't go into that.  But one thing I don't know why people don't touch on is how in this one Arnold Schwartzneggar is actually a Terminator, whereas in the sequels he's not as much a Terminator as a Protector.  In this one his mission is to kill someone whereas in the other movies his mission is to keep someone alive.  It's kind of a contradiction to keep ""The Terminator"" in the name of the movies when he's not actually doing that.  Don't you agree?  This is my biggest reason for my dilemma on deciding which ""Terminator"" movie was better.

Anyway, this movie is a lot more darker than the other two, which I've come to appreciate more than I did when I first saw this when I was much younger.  This takes place in downtown L.A. whereas the others took place in the suburbs, where there were no bums and gangsters all over the place, not to mention litter.  This movie also was ""scarier"" in the sense that the terminations were a lot more brutal, or maybe they just seemed that way because of the darker cinematography and because the characters that were killed were given a lot more character development, hence a chance for us to get familiar with them and maybe even like them.  A good example is the two detectives.

Another thing different in this movie is the level of desparation.  There was more desparation for a human protector than there was for a machine that feels no pain, fear, panic or stress.  You also feel more for a human that gets hurt or dies than a machine, even though we might have gotten attached to Arnie in the sequels.

One thing I also like about this movie is the action and excitement and appeal is based more on the relentlessness and callousness of The Terminator and the reaction of it all by the humans, than on big budget explosions, chase scenes and special effects.  It is very ""un-Hollywood"" where as the second one dipped a bit more, though in a reasonable amount, into those things.  The third one dipped a lot more into it, which is something I don't find that appealing.

As for special effects, those really are the worst thing about this movie.  I don't know if they were good for 80's movies but that mask or fake head they made for The Terminator when it got its eye messed up was horrible.  Same with the animation of The Terminator when its skinned got burned off.  Also, the sound effects of the guns were sometimes cheesey (high-pitched whistles like a cartoon) and inconsistent.  The future war scenes were O.K. but nothing to brag about.

However, this goes a lot more into the plot and story of the whole war, the resistance (TechCom), Skynet and the Terminators, as all explained by Reese.  They do that in the sequels but somehow it seemed more appealing in this one.

The acting is great.  Arnold does a good job as an emotionless machine, though I find the few facial expressions he makes every now and then in the film questionable.  Why would a machine need to make a facial expression?  Linda Hamilton does a good job of playing a somewhat disorganized clutz of a woman who is suddenly thrust into this battle.  And Michael Beign is great as Reese, who doesn't play a smooth, confident soldier as would be easy, but rather take the high road as a war-stricken soldier who's not on the brink of losing it but knows just what he's up against and what's at stake.  He's neither confident nor smooth but rather determined and unsure of how he will win and defeat The Terminator.

The script is good too.  The pacing is a little slower in the beginning than in the other ones, just because of the fact that I guess there was a lot more that needed to be shown.  Still, great lines though.  There's of course, ""I'll be back,"" which has never impressed me that much, but there's also other good ones, such as, ""Wrong,"" (after which he blasts the gunstore seller with a shotgun), ""F**k, you a**hole!"" and, ""You've been targeted for termination.""  There are many others too, ones worth devoting the time to memorize.

There's very few plot holes if any, and whatever they are they don't bother you like with a lot of movies.  The actions are simple yet great as for the reasons I stated above.  The ""coolest"" scene in the movie is when The Terminator guns his way through the police department, mowing down any cop in his way with no feelings about it.  He looks d**m cool in his sunglasses, which he actually wears for a reason, leather jacket, boots and dual assault rifles, and he does this all without trying to look like some smooth Hollywood action star.

Anyway, I have to admit I'm leaning towards this movie as the best in the series.  I have only come to appreciate it more recently and like it a lot more than I did when I first saw it in the past, which was about 10 years ago or so.  It is certainly the most unique and definitely worth buying.  I hope this helps and I hope I got all my thoughts down.",1136592000,,5177,4.467518636847711
2135705,5,B0002WYTWG,"Hello,

There are many great movies from the realm of science fiction and this is one of the best and most family friendly too. This movie has great fighting scenes, great special effect, cool characters, and a cool story. If you are really really picky about the realities of time travel then you might have issues with this movie, but then you probably aren't watching that much science fiction anyways. Another movie that is scarier, but also great in the way this movie is the movie Aliens, the second movie of the 4 movies about the acid-blooded, egg laying aliens and the character Riply. However, I think this is a movie that is more appropriate for little kids (not too little), and a movie that can be watched over and over again, as it's just plain fun!",1136505600,,763,4.569343065693431
2135706,2,B0002WYTWG,"First off let me point out that another reviewer is writing his review based on the ""Ultimate Edition"" of Terminator 2, not this edition. This is the ""EXTREME Edition"". The Ultimate Edition came out first, and as far as I can tell, is no longer available... though I wish it was. I will return to why in a moment.

Secondly let me say that I love the movie Terminator 2. I believe it to be a truly great Sci-Fi Epic by the great James Cameron, who directed ""The Abyss"" (a Sci-Fi classic that was one of the first movies to have a major scene use extended pieces of Computer Generated Special Effects ), as well as the classic ""Aliens"", and some might be surprised to know he also directed ""Titanic"". Cameron is a truly great director in that he tried to create great films that are multidimensional, incorporating character, dialogue, plot and indeed the visuals to create memorable movies.

T2: Judgment Day combined great effects (for the time), fantastic action (it set the standard for many years to come), human emotions and an analytical/philosophical commentary (on things ranging from human nature, to the relationship of technology and man, to fate). Thus T2 is not just a great Sci-fi movie, or a great action movie, but a great FILM. Arnold might not be the best actor, but at least he plays a machine, which ironically is the one thing he might be cut out to portray believably. Fortunately the rest of the cast, particularly the actress playing Sarah Connor, do a fairly good job in their expanded roles of putting a human side to this story.

Yes, if I was just rating T2 as a movie I would give it 5 stars. However, I can't give this edition DVD of the movie 5 stars. Why? Where to start.

Another reviewer gives detailed information promising you the world if you buy this DVD. This is simply not true. What the DVD does contain is a Special Edition Digitally Re-mastered version of the movie. The special edition also includes up to 16 minutes of additional footage from previously deleted scenes. That's great! What's not so great is that there is no option to play the original version of the movie (without these new scenes) and unfortunately, while they are cool to see, I don't think all of them are really worthy. Some of these feel out of place, or it is easy to see why they were removed from the movie before release. Others are nice to have, but really I'd like the option. Unlike the other reviewer's comments, you don't have such option, it's part of the movie, and that's that. If I'm wrong about this, please email me and show me and I'll gladly retract this statement.

There's an audio commentary option, as well as a cool new ""interactive mode"" that gives constant information pertaining to the current scene. Sort of like that old show ""Pop Up Video"" for music videos. There's a huge amount of information here, and sometimes it will tell you to click enter to learn more and it will take you to some behind the scenes footage. Some of this is good. Some seems to not play right on my player (or it could just be how it was done). The entire movie is also in 16x9, which is nice if you have (or plan to some day have) a 16x9 widescreen TV or an HDTV. It's not so nice if you have a standard definition TV. Even typical widescreen is usually 2.35:1 aspect ratio. I usually prefer full screen myself (I like to use the whole screen for the picture) unless it's a movie I deem worthy of widescreen (such as movies with lots of big shots and beautiful cinematography, which T2 would likely apply). However I can tolerate, and even appreciate widescreen at 2.35, the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen are minimal. At 16X9 however, it's a bit obnoxious; the video is a thin ""strip"" across the screen and more of the screen is taken up by the bars than by the picture. boo. It would be nice if they could have given you the both wide and full screen versions, as other DVD releases such as the Rambo Series did where the full screen is on one side and widescreen on the other. Oh well.

Onto disc 2. Here you get 2 documentaries. Just 2. The other reviewer is talking about the ultimate edition, which indeed is packed with extras. What special features will you find here? One 20 minute documentary, and another 8 minute short! That's IT!! Here's what you DON'T get: Trailers, TV Spots, Interviews with cast and crew, a comprehensive ""the making of"" documentary, footage of the premier, etc. In other words, none of the stuff that was on the Ultimate (no longer available) Edition DVD!! None of the stuff you would EXPECT to be on the ""extreme"" edition, especially since it is trying to be the DVD to end all DVDs.

You do however get a lovely foil-coated cover for the case! (note the sarcasm) You also get some bells and whistles like special DVD Rom features. Put the disc in your computer and install the necessary software and you can create a picture of yourself as a terminator or a short video clip showing your picture morphing into a T1000 or into another photo. That's all cool and what not, but really it's just a gimmick. You'll toy with it once or let your kids play with it, and that's it.

There's also a 16X9 High Definition version of the Theatrical Version (no extended scenes) on this disc, but only for Microsoft Media Player 9. In other words you can only play it on your computer (a very fast computer, don't bother trying if your machine is less than 3 GHz or has less than 512MB of RAM and a decent video and sound card). What good is this? I can watch the other version in my computer on my standard DVD player software, why bother having this nifty high def version unless you really have the hardware to take advantage of it? I don't even get a regular theatrical version to play on my TV and they are giving me one that plays in my computer??!

Moreover it irks me to no end that this edition lacks TV spots, trailers, and a comprehensive documentary. Even the Princess Bride DVD has all this! The most basic releases now have this standard. Especially with a movie like this I want to know the origins, the director's thoughts, the preproduction debates and storyline development, the casting, the compromises, etc. All we get is 28 minutes of fluff, most of which is just a short piece about T2's impact on digital effects, but never goes into full detail about their techniques.

Extreme? Extreme waste of money. If you have the Ultimate Edition, treasure it! And avoid this garbage unless you truly have a monster home entertainment center or a beast of a multimedia PC and want to put it to the test. If you just want to own the movie on DVD, try and find the Ultimate Edition if you can. You get more for less. Ultimate Edition has SO much this one lacks. Truly, this is a sad day for DVD consumers.

Rather than buy this, you should email Artisan and complain.",1134691200,,6838,4.479935794542536
2135707,5,B0002WYTWG,"Well I am not going to review the movie because you probably already know how great it is. Instead I will just speak for this edition of the movie- The Ultimate Edition DVD. Whether you get the dual disc set or the dual sided single disc set makes no difference since the same content is on each pressing.

Ok now for the technical stuff. This is the best edition of the movie to own for several reasons:

1.) DTS! Forget Dolby Digital, there is a night and day difference when you watch a movie in DTS and this is a fine example of what a film should sound like. DTS makes much better use of the center and surround speakers. The Dolby version just drowns them all together. Also the Extreme edition does not have the DTS track, only the Ultimate.

2.) You get all three versions of the film on one disc! Theatrical, Special and the Extended Special version. The third version was cut from the Extreme edition (probably due to inconsistency with T3 being released that same summer) and the Theatrical can only be seen in HDTV via a super fast computer on the Extreme edition. With the Ultimate edition you get it all without the need of fancy super expensive computers and a small screen.

3.) Extras! There are so many extras on the second disc I can almost promise that if you were sick, you could sit in front of your TV and by the time you finish watching all the bonus material that you will be over your cold/flu/fever lol. Those of you with ""The Abyss"" (white box) know what I'm talking about.

4.) Last but not least is the neat metal case cover this Ultimate ed comes in. It is aluminum; I repeat aluminum not tin like the Extreme edition's (which had a tendency to rip the case's spine and artwork). Aluminum is more expensive than paper so granted they only made the first production with the aluminum, but they can still be found. I would be perfectly happy with the paper case cover, after all you are mainly concerned about the movie right- not the case cover lol.

So there you have it, several reasons why the Ultimate edition is the best version of the movie to have on DVD. To play the Extended Special version, you will need to enter a code for the Easter egg to work. This is very easy, with the timeline menu up and running, click on the special edition choice. Then with ""play special edition"" highlighted, enter 82997 (August 29, 1997 for J-Day) somewhat quickly and you will hear a sound effect while the other eye of the Terminator T800 lights up and now you will see a third menu at the top saying ""play extended special edition"". Now both eyes of the T800 are light up and at the right in yellow you will see ""THE FUTURE IS NOT SET"" and that's it. There are a few Easter eggs on the bonus disc as well. You can search Yahoo or Google to find those. Enjoy.

Since Amazon sometimes mixes up the different editions of the same movie, I will mention a little about the Extreme version. It says is is from a brand new film transfer, but comparing my girlfriend's Extreme ed. to my Ultimate ed. I could tell no difference. Also the Extreme is very lacking in the extras department. However the HighDefinition (disc 2) is really neat and a big difference in quality over the normal 480i version. But it just takes a fast computer and a good display to reap the benefit Artisan and Van Ling wanted to provide you.",1134518400,,3333,4.392220421393841

If you would be happy without the HD this is great.  If you are counting on the HD buy at risk.  There are still way to many variables for the video to consistenly work.  This is mainly because of copy protection and all the funky stuff they try to do to ensure you only use their player etc.

Also, another reviewer referred to a code you need to view the HD content.  I never saw a place to enter it.  My installation went to the internet and got the codec necessary to run it and never asked me for any number to validate anything.

2135710,5,B0002WYTWG,"Although this movie is dark and has no humor in it,
it is worth seeing. It has a gripping sci-fi story about a cyborg machine that comes from the future to kill the guy who would become its enemy. The special effects were good at the time. It gave birth to the classic phrase ""I'LL BE BACK!""
It even starts with a scene from the vicinity of Los Angeles, which you can visit in real life.

This movie (along with ""Total Recall"") helped Arnold Schwarzenegger to enter into the genre of sci-fi movies. Until that moment, he was just playng muscle-man barbarians.
The word ""Terminator"" has become almost a household name, and some people nowadays call Arnold ""the governator"" (a mixture of governor and terminator).

Just one warning: do not try to repeat at home the things that the Terminator does: i.e. looking dead serious, killing women, crashing cars into buildings, saying things like ""f... you as....."" etc.",1133481600,,911,4.7594936708860756
2135711,5,B0002WYTWG,"The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd-pleasing action scenes with truly thought-provoking and clever concepts. From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.

Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.

Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-`80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.

As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right ""action-hero"" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the ""tender moments"" last about three minutes in total.

With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list.",1133049600,,2808,5.045258620689655

In this case, Kyle Reese is sent to protect Sarah from the T-101.

2135713,5,B0002WYTWG,"In reviewer Ronald Thomson's DVDTown critique of the previous release of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" he called it ""a landmark film in special effects development."" True, and Artisan's ""Ultimate Edition DVD"" establishes yet another benchmark, the first DVD to utilize the medium's full potential--over six hours of material on a single dual-layered, dual-sided disc. It's what director James Cameron was said to have wanted with ""Titanic."" Now, he gets his way. The disc contains two versions of the movie, the primary theatrical release and a special, extended version, plus over forty special features. I'm not entirely sure I agree with Ronald's assessment of the film's having an entertainment value of 10, but I'm willing to concede the point in its ""Ultimate Edition"" trappings. I certainly concur with everything else Ronald said, especially that ""Terminator 2"" belongs in any sci-fi collection. Now, before I comment on the special bonus items, here's more of what Ronald said about the movie itself...the first DVD to utilize the medium's full potential--over six hours of material on a single dual-layered, dual-sided disc.

""The first terminator failed to change history. It's up to a second terminator to terminate John Conner in his youth years after the attempt to kill his mother. Granted, just another cyborg won't do. The terminator sent back to change history has the ability to emulate any non-mechanical object it comes in contact with, but Arnold Schwarzenegger is up to the task of saving the world, even against an indestructible, morphing adversary in this terminator-on-terminator battle.

Thanks to the marvels of time travel, John Conner was raised believing that the world would be devastated and he would lead the rebellion against the machines. His mother, however, was committed for being delusional. After all, how could machines take over the world? Now, two terminators show up, and he realizes that his mother was right.""

Video & Audio:
The audio and video for the movie are fine. Definitely high quality. The sound and anamorphic picture are THX certified, but more important, the detail in sound staging is excellent. For instance, in one of the opening scenes, a motorcycle drives by on the road, and the audio definitely tracks with the location of the bike, even though it's a simple background noise. Amazing battles, fights, explosions, gun shots, and chase scenes leave the viewer enjoying the movie, not just admiring its technical perfection. The picture is slightly light, overall, and perhaps a tad soft. I would have liked a greater color depth.

More from Thomson: ""'T2' is not perfect, the acting leaving much to be desired. But then, so is the acting in ""Star Wars"" imperfect. In both cases, however, the acting does not detract from the movies' overall effectiveness, presentation, or entertainment value.""

Extras:
Thanks, Ronald, now let's hit those new bonus features, starting with side one, which is labeled ""Side A"" in print so small you have to hold it to the light and squint to read it. This is the main side, and the first thing you'll notice when it starts up is the snazzy new interface. The animated menu design looks like the inside of a robotics factory for terminator cyborgs. However, while it's beautiful to look at, it presents some problems getting around. A warning comes with the package (which is housed, by the way, in a handsome brushed-aluminum casing) stating that ""due to the advanced features utilized in the creation of this DVD, some players may experience minor navigational difficulties."" My Sony 7700 player had no technical difficulty navigating the menus, but I had trouble finding everything I needed to. Some of the directional arrows are so dark and so tiny, they can be hard to spot, and they are often not located with the rest of the items on a screen. It also took me a moment to locate the THX tests advertised on the box. They're in the audio section and indicated by a little ""THX"" sign on the skeletal metal head to the left of the main audio choices. Once you find these tests, though, which are about the same as those found on the ""Fight Club"" DVD and basically duplicate the tests on most standard DVD setup discs like ""Video Essentials,"" you'll find them handy to use. They include checks for color calibration, brightness, convergence, channel balance, channel-phase polarity, subwoofer integration, and other such criteria for optimizing a home theater.

Now, you're almost ready to choose which version of the movie you want to watch. The first is the regular theatrical release at 136 minutes; the other is the special edition with sixteen minutes of additional material. Some of this extra stuff is in bits and pieces scattered about; and some of it is contained in completely new scenes, raising the chapter index to an astounding eighty selections, maybe a record of its kind, an index point for about every two minutes of screen time! If you have already seen the film, and who hasn't, I advise watching the special edition; it's one of the few instances where the added material makes sense and isn't just included as a gimmick. But the chapter selections menu is no longer animated as it was in the previous disc. I suppose some things had to go, and it's a miracle the engineers were able to cram as much as they did on both sides of one disc. Anyway, the side also contains four different audio tracks: one in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, another in DTS 5.1 ES, a third in Dolby Surround 2.0, and a final one featuring commentary by members of the cast and crew. English is the only spoken language option, but subtitles are provided in English for the hearing impaired. There are also extensive cast and crew biographies and filmographies, plus some DVD-ROM items. The keep case claims that the film was newly remastered in THX, but as far as I could tell in comparing it to its prior DVD incarnation, the picture and sound quality appear the same, with the anamorphic screen ratio an identical 2.17:1. Perhaps Artisan meant that the film was newly remastered for DVD previously. In any case, the picture and sound are still as good as could be hoped for and deserving of the highest rating that could be assigned them.

Side two (B) is where you'll find most of the bonus materials. Again, navigation may be an initial problem, but once you think you get the hang of it, it becomes no easier. Here, in various categories, you will discover more than you could ever want to know about the film, its history, and its production. One of the subdivisions is called ""Information Programs,"" and it includes the disc's three main documentaries. The first is a thirty-minute promo titled ""The Making of T2,"" produced at the time of the film's shooting in 1991. You'll see interviews with the stars and crew and various behind-the-scenes looks at the techniques used in the filmmaking. The second, twenty-two-minute, featurette, made in 1993 for the Showtime cable channel and titled ""T2: More Than Meets the Eye,"" is even more interesting. It deals with the longer version of the movie and explains why certain scenes had to be cut for the original theatrical release and why they were filmed in the first place. The third documentary, the twenty-three-minute ""Making of Terminator 2 3D: Breaking the Screen Barrier,"" is all about the creation of the MCA/Universal Studios theme park attraction and hints that the attraction may be a stepping stone to a possible third theatrical feature. We'll see.

Another subdivision on side two is called ""Visual Campaigns."" It includes four trailers, three in partial widescreen and one in pan-and-scan, and five Japanese teasers. Then there's a third subdivision, called ""Data Hub,"" which has even more information. To begin with, it contains the complete shooting script of the film in 574 text frames. Placing the written text over a flaming red-and-orange backdrop, though, was a questionable decision. I didn't read the entire script, only the first few pages, but had I tried, I probably would have needed new glasses by now. (The DVD-ROM portion of the disc allows one to read the script while looking at many of the storyboards.) Next, there are what appear to be hundreds of regular storyboard sequences and archives. Tons and tons of archival stuff. In fact, there are sixty separate video selections, each individually indexed, probing the filmmaking process with cast and crew. Of these, I was particularly taken with the segments using multi-angle shots, the Terminator saying ""I'll be back"" in a variety of languages, and the sequence demonstrating the video transfer of ""T2"" for separate letterbox and pan-and-scan versions taken from the same Super-35 negative. And in yet another section, ""Data Core,"" you'll find fifty more chapters worth of supplemental items. Somewhere buried in all of these hours of bonus goods, there is supposed to be an article titled ""Battle Across Three Dimensions"" by Estelle Shay, but try as I might, I honestly couldn't find it. Next, if you have the patience, wait twenty seconds or so for a static menu screen to come to life and then click on it; you will be rewarded by a link to a not-so-hidden Web site. Finally, a thirty-two-page informational booklet insert may also set a record of sorts. You'll be exploring for weeks.

Parting Thoughts:
Without question, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" the Ultimate Edition DVD, is well named. It is a milestone in the evolution of the DVD medium for its ability to carry huge quantities of information into the home. The movie itself looks and sounds as good as ever, and in its extended version it may even be a better story. This disc is an obvious must-buy, whether you own the earlier DVD or not.",1132531200,,9744,4.9474648747709224

2135715,4,B0002WYTWG,"I am building a multimedia computer, and this is the second theatrical feature i have tried playing.

A big problem with this and ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" is that they were released before Windows Media 10 was available, and so required a few add-ins to make it play in WM-9. Unfortunately this skin is not upward compatible. in order to make it play, you must:

1. Either do not install or Go to control Panel, add-remove programs, and uninstall the player that was installed by the disk called INTERACTUAL VIDEO PLAYER or suchlike.

2. Look in the root directory of disk two for a program called DVDRUN.EXE (you may not see the "".EXE"" extension.) double click to run that program. DVDRUN.exe will go on the internet to obtain a 5 day license to play the movie. (after 5 days you can go get another one when needed.) The license will be installed and managed by Windows Media 10.

3. Use windows search to find the .ASX files on the DVD. .ASX files are Windows Media 10 playlists. For Terminator 2, the first file is called CHAP_0. ASX but you should be able to use this method for other ""legacy"" DVD versions of .WMV movies. You only need to click on the first file, the other chapter lists are chained automatically.

For newly released WMV-HD and, hopefully, future versions of T2, Windows Media Player 10 and above will simply start automagically and begin playing the movie.

If this were the case, then where did the first terminator come from? So now we have a cyborg which was created ""Ex Nihlo"" and which suddenly appeared by some sort of divine intervention. From this point on, these movies collectively have an element of comedy factored in. I think the directors saw this critical plot flaw and, in turn, doubled the amount of guns, exposions, and loud noises in T2 to distract the loose attention span of the movie goers watching.

However, the problems came about when I stopped the movie about 30 minutes into it to do something else that I had to do.

The engrossing and inevitable between the man and the machine is cynically remarked through apparently simple narrative devices (for instance, the use of Atari -a machine to fake another machine - and get some money; the simulated War games in the Gallery moments before T 1000 makes his appearance; the pleasant moments in which our future hero young boy tries to advise his mentor machine, that not all human being must be exterminated, the hard explanation about what feelings mean, the funny twists of words in search perhaps of his missed future father).

The future against the fate!

The impressive opening sequence, in which we watch the mechanic foot flattening the brain's skull, (suggesting a clear statement about who is the master) of the bloody Battle between men and machines is visually stunning.

The undeniable and superb employment of EFX , makes of this last device another invisible actor. There are many breathtaking chases, and the double final battle keeps for you a clever message; the machine against the human race, exterminating any possible trace about developing the future technology that will produce the abominable cyber generation. The perspective of the viewer is cleverly twisted , but imagine you change of vision angle and  ignoring all the futuristic dramatis personae to come. They would be a terrorist sect trying to avoid the ineffable progress. On the other hand we have the final confrontation between both machine generations, but the game has ended and the final resolution is a true hair raising battle in the middle (once more the underground irony) of an industrial stage. The elevated temperature of these furnaces permit through the melting process the transformation of solid metal into liquid metal, and that 's another winner premise.  The only way to face and win is reversing the process and make the liquid metal - the support structure of the new generation returns to its origin. Fire extinguishing the fire and both machines will find themselves in that melting cemetery.

2135731,5,B0002WYTWG,"Plot: A cyborg from the 2029 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has arrived in the present (which, for the sake of the film, is 1984). In this near future, machines are rising to near domination over humans. The reason he has been sent back in time? To terminate. You see, in this seemingly hopeless future, there will be a man who is capable of leading an army that conquers the machines. The cyborg must terminate the mother of that child -- Sarah Connor. Also sent back in time is the ""good guy"" of the story -- Reese. Reese has been sent ot protect Sarah from the cyborg, to be sure the child is eventually born. But, even with Sarah's natural determination to live and Reese's passion for his duty, the incredibly advanced humanoid machine will be one tough cookie to beat! Can they terminate the terminator? Will our future ever be safe from the rise of the machines?

A wonderful storyline, a heart-pounding score, great direction by James Cameron, and an overall grim feeling of futuristic mayhem are just a few of the aspects of The Terminator that make it a scifi classic. Is it Schwarzenegger on screen with his mechanical brutality that attracts so many? Or maybe the terrifying ride along with Reese and Sarah trying to escape this madness? Maybe we'll never really know why this is such an amazing movie. Still, time and time again, nothing compares to the darkly action-packed experience of The Terminator forever frozen in time with your DVD copy.

2135744,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is a true classic that really made Arnold famous. The visual effects may look cheesy now but for 1984, it was revolutionary. That's 21 years ago! The movie was directed by James Cameron and was followed up by an even better sequel. Buy this one and Terminator 2: Judgement Day and rent T3: Rise of the machines, and you'll be in for a true treat.

This one is about a cyborg sent from the future in the past/ present to kill Sarah Connor because she would give birth to a son that would lead the resistance against the machines. Arnold plays the machine/ Cyborg/ robot and he's big, mean, and just awesome. He tears out a page from the phone book, and decides to kill every Sarah Connor. The movie is absolutely wonderfully made. But a man is also sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor.

The movie is very suspensful and absolutely brilliant thanks to Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and Arnold Schw.. as the evil cyborg. Arnold barely talks but has an evil stare with a very mean look. He does have some awesome catch phrases such as ""I'll be back!"".

When you watch this movie, remember that it's a classic and that it made Arnold famous. Just look at his eye contact and facial expressions. That shows everything. Also, don't laugh at how cheesy some scenes are, it was made 21 years ago! The special effects in this movie were AMAZING FOR THE TIME!

2135745,5,B0002WYTWG,"There's already great reviews regarding the movie, so I'm just going to add the differences between the R1 DVDs.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ULTIMATE EDITION and EXTREME EDITION DVD:

Extreme has better sound and picture quality, but you don't really notice unless you are watching it on a HUGE screen with a very expensive Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound system (THX approved of course), and have a guy that produced the DVD sitting next to you pointing out the VERY slight differences in quality.

If I remember correctly, the Extreme edition is the only release that has a director's commentary featuring Cameron and William Wisher. UE has a commentary featuring lots of cast and crew that's pieced together from other interviews.

The Extreme Edition has lots of making of and behind the scenes clips that can be accessed right from the movie. As you're watching, a Cyberdyne logo will appear up in the corner of the screen. If you click on it, it'll take you to extra info about that particular scene, behind the scenes footage, interviews, etc. I think some of the clips are different from those included in the extras of the UE version, and some are the same. When the clip is done, it'll return you right to the part of the movie you were at, and continue the movie. (There's also a menu page where these clips can be accessed directly without having to go into the movie.)

Extreme also has DVD-ROM features that Ultimate doesn't have, such as a Windows Media Player 9 High-Definition transfer of the 139 minute theatrical cut. Extreme also has a 9-10 minute montage of behind the scenes clips that aren't on UE.

Another difference between the two is that the UE contains the 139 minute theatrical cut, 152 minute director's cut, AND 156 minute extended director's cut of the film (it has the alternate ending and a scene that shows the T-1000 searching John's room), while the Extreme only has the 139 and 152 minute versions of the film. The 156 minute version is an easter egg on the UE though, which can be accessed on Disc 1/Side 1.

Where is it?
Select the ""Special Edition"" option at the main menu. Enter 8, 29, 97 at the special edition screen to access the ""Extended Special Edition"" version of the film.

What is it?
Two extra scenes will appear during the special edition (director's cut) version of the movie.

Note: Some remote controls require the +10 button to be used to enter the numbers, other DVD players will need to have Enter pressed after each individual digit.

As for soundtracks, the UE features: Dolby EX 6.1, DTS ES 6.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 and the cast and crew commentary.

The Extreme features a Dolby Digital EX 5.1 soundtrack, Dolby headphone audio track, and the Cameron commentary.

Ultimate has the better ""extras"", and the 156 minute cut of the film.

So it's up to you. Go for the same film with less extras (Extreme), or the same film with more extras (Ultimate).

However, if you love the UE, I'd wait for the movie to hit a Hi-Definition format before you go buying the movie again.",1120003200,,3029,4.67984934086629

2135748,3,B0002WYTWG,"There are several complains about this DVD release.

first of all, They said that they had sacrificed DTS soundtrack to Transfer better picture. but something does not seem right! what's the difference between this package's Disc 1 and the ultimate edition's disc one? I have both of them and absolutely there is no difference except the ultimate edition has an additional DTS soundtrack. Extreme edition has a new audio commentary but it doesn't take much space. there was enough space to put DTS on this release too!

Second complain is, the High definition version of the movie which is available on Disc 2, only works on Computer and only on an expensive absolutely powerful and up to date computer! so if you don't have any, you'll have no chance to play it even with problem! most of people have 17"" or 19"" flat monitor and a little have widescreen big monitors. would anybody enjoy watching a high difinition movie in a 17"" monitor except watching a regular transfer in a big screen TV? I don't think so!

If you read my review, and if you don't have the Ultimate edition, buy that release and never think of this one!",1118188800,,1125,4.64321608040201
2135749,5,B0002WYTWG,"The T2 Extreme edition bonus disc has the theatrical version of the film encoded in High Definition (HD) using the windows media series 9 codec.  This encoding looks brilliant and is far superior to the normal DVD on direct comparison.  It must be played by a Windows computer and requirtes a 500K patch for windows media 10 users.

Unfortunately,it also requires you use the included InterActual DVD player to play the protected content.  That DVD player sucks, but is usable. My problem with it is it would exit out of full screen if I tried to use my KVM, so I had to put down the mouse to watch the movie. Another small issue is that, due to the DVD format, the movie was broken into 2GB segments (4 in all) and there was a 3 - 10 second delay whenever it loaded a new segment.  No big deal.

The encoding looks brilliant on my 1280 x 1024 flat panel monitor (presumably 720p) but it appears as though the encoding is even higher, perhaps 1080.  It played relatively stutter-free on my 2.4ghz Dell desktop w/ 512MB RAM and an NVIDIA 5700 fx ultra 128MB video card.  I should note that I couldn't get interactual to install on my other computer (and was therefore unable to watch the content on that computer) due to it's inability to ""initialize the audio subsystem.""  I didn't particularly troubleshoot this though.

So, for those of you out there that are sick of waiting for HD to get out of the realm of only broadcast TV (where it's not available to so many) and simply can't wait for the HD DVD to be accepted, manufactured and flooded with re-releases, then WMVHD (Windows Media Version High Definition) is for you.  There are ~10 titles out in the format now and they can be previewed at wmvhd.com.  Most of them are IMAX films.

I want more releases on WMV! I'm addicted to HD and can't get it anywhere yet! Only on the bonus disc of T2 Extreme Edition.",1116633600,,1866,4.452941176470588
2135750,4,B0002WYTWG,"Director:  James Cameron.

Cast:  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn.

Rated R for violence, language, nudity, and sexual situations.

Running Time:  108 minutes.

Underrated and much more entertaining than many would lead you to believe, ""The Terminator"" is one of the most innovative science-fiction thrillers of all-time and is also the film that put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the Hollywood map.  The Governor of California stars as an android robot sent from the future to destroy an unsuspecting future mother (Linda Hamilton) of a child that will disrupt mankind's fight against technology in decades to come.  Michael Biehn (with a superb supporting performance) plays a time-traveling agent also sent back from the future, but his role is to make sure that Hamilton is contained safely until the terminating android is destroyed.

One of the earlier works from the great James Cameron (""Titanic"", ""Aliens""), this special effects spectacle is an entertaining roller-coaster ride full of thrills, macabre, and good ol' Schwarzenegger fun.  The film may unfortunately be known for some of the terminator's corny lines (""I'll be back.""), but it should be recognized for one of the best cinematic climaxes in science-fiction history.  Excellent cinematography, a solid musical score, and nice performances.  Outdone by its sequel, but special and important in its own right.",1115856000,,1394,5.518867924528302

We nearly did something else 'cuz the trailers for The Terminator were flat-out lame...even the name ""The Terminator"" seemed kinda hokey. But we said ""what the hell"" and bought some tickets. There were maybe 10-15 other people in the theatre when the lights went down...not exactly opening night numbers to be popping champagne over.

He proceeds to find as much ammo as possible, and track down Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. Hamilton delivers a good performance as a young woman frightened out of her wits.

Excellent special effects coupled with some amazing action sequences make for an exciting and gripping watch.  I particularly thought that the chase scene near the beginning was quite well done.  And I found Robert Patrick to be the perfect part as the T-1000 robot; his steely determined expression really was convincing.  In terms of this movie being a ""classic"" as some reviewers would have it--I wouldn't go so far.  The movie does have some inconsistancies and weak parts.  But overall, it is a very good and entertaining action movie.  It's kind of odd watching this movie with its post-apocalyptic element; the movie came out just at the end of the Cold War era when the possibility of an apocalyptic end to civilization was very real; that likelihood has, thankfully, become much less likely, and I think that makes the movie less unsettling and dark as when I first saw it.",1110672000,,1054,4.664864864864865

2135763,5,B0002WYTWG,"Known for having sets and ideas that tend to push the bounds of filmmaking, James Cameron likes to be ambitious and have films that would otherwise be quite a bold risk. Before this film he made the Abyss, a complicated underwater shoot that wasn't a huge hit Fox wanted it to be and before that Aliens, a really tight schedule with big sets, miniatures and a 10 feet tall queen alien. Now the advancements are more digital but still no less groundbreaking and in turn, still exciting.

John Connor, mankind's savior after machines declare war on their creators, is actually a deviant, robbing ATM's of cash with a special laptop and disobeying his foster parents and getting in trouble with the law. His mother Sarah is in an insane asylum has her declarations of nuclear war, machines, terminators and time travel make her apparently nuts. In the first film, the machines tried to kill Sarah before she gave birth to John. Now, they're going after John himself.

As a protector, John in the future reprograms a terminator to save his skin in the past instead of the last time which was a human soldier.  Only he looks like the terminator from the last one so it obviously freaks Sarah out since he tried so hard to kill her.

The film is definately more ambitious with a thrilling bike/semi chase to the rescue and escape from the insane asylum and to the incredibly real and powerful nuclear dream, it really pushes the series into a better direction rather than just being a nice action movie, this is a ride.

Also after ILM's digital breakthrough with the pseudopod from the Abyss(that water tentacle), ILM was responsible for creating the T-1000, the villain of the film who's entirely liquid metal and is capable of imitating what he touches and using his body to creating blades to stab people with.

The movie quite frankly oozes cool. It's got action scenes, drama and character development, some comedy and some classic scenes(I still smile during the ""Bad to the Bone"" intro). The DVD set is practically exhausting where it details so much about the film, you probably know enough to create your own Terminator 2 but let's face it, you can't duplicate a classic, there's one already here.",1110067200,,2201,4.7486910994764395
2135764,4,B0002WYTWG,"Just before he made this, James Cameron made Piranha II. It's best you don't seek it out.  But he had the idea for this film after a dream where he was the intended target of the terminators. While it's not a bad film, it certainly is dated throughout the entire thing as an 80's film.

In the 90's, mankind will create an AI, or artificial intelligence. However, the AI becomes aware of itself and decides to nuke mankind. From then on, the machines annihilating the humans. A lone man named John Connor teaches the men how to fight and bring war to the machines and hold their own. To counteract this, the machines send a special machine called a terminator into the past to go after John's mother Sarah before he's born. So our guys send Kyle Reese to protect Sarah.

It's pretty cool watching this film as even though he hasn't had a whole lot experience, James knows how to shoot a film. Action scenes are well done and they're pretty simplistic in its terms too unlike the ambitious sequel.

The effects probably down the film as they are quite dated and very visible including the makeup effects when Arnold gets smashed up or when the full terminator skeleton walks. In T2, a lot of the effects still hold up despite advancements, here, they look old. But of course, the terminator's so cool you're thinking who cares?

It's the movie that launched James Cameron's career, made Arnold a star, and was a launching pad for more advancements in technology. It looks its age but it's still no less fun",1110067200,,1505,4.559259259259259

awesome every time

saw it in theatres at age 10 with my pops

shocking it was

very funny

very shocking

very full of action

great story

moving characters

shocking visuals

I closed my eyes in the parts where the T1000 stuck people with his sharp hands

like the dad getting gouged through the throat while drinking a carton of milk. the cop getting stuck in the eye to death while his double ( T 1000) stood there prying it deeper, the trucker asking if T1000 is alright and he knives him right thru the chest into the heart. ouch that has to hurt all of these people. great movie. great cinematics. glad I got this on dvd. Robert Patrick makes a great villain. he's also great in Fire in the Sky. a truly shocking alien like tale movie. see if you haven't.

2135766,5,B0002WYTWG,"You get a very interesting Horror/sci-fi film that stamped James Camron, and Arnold Schwarzenegger around the world.

This movie is about Sarah Conor(Linda Hamilton) who's unborn son will be the turning point of the war with the machines.  But the machines refuse to go out like some chumps.  They send a rithless machine, the T-model 101(Arnold Schwarzenegger to waste her like a coke can.  This is the only time you'll see Arnold as a ruthless mo'fo but it's undeniebly an unforgettable performance.  But the humans send one of their own, a human who knows the situation.  Cyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to protect her, but the million dollar question is, can they do it, or will they be ruthlessly slaughtered by the heartless machine.

The one thing I like about this film, is the fear it presents.  It seems nothing that Cyle and Sarah do can stop him, not even a police force of 30 men with shotguns and assult rifles even stalled this baaaaad dude.  It makes the Terminator feel almost invincible.  Even the dated special effects at the end, where the terminator looked fake, made him look scary.  If he moved realistic, I dunno, but with him moving fake, accually mad him look scarier.

Arnold in this one is the scariest out of the terminators, because the protagonist wasn't a machine, but a human.  T-1000 is the best because liquid metal seemed nearly indutuctable.  The T-X is just, well T3 shouldn't have even been made.  I mean T3 made the hairstyles on the wemon in this film look sexy(Well maybe)

James Camron's carrer was made, and Arnold's carrer skyrocketed way up.  This may have been low budgeted, but high hearted.  This film is second to the clerverly made sequal that continued the plot so flawlessly, and this film makes T3 look like junk.  Anyone who loves sci-fi or horror, go check this out.  Anyone who saw T2 but not this, need to check out the begininer.

The simple men simply can not change it, but the rest can do it. I will face the destiny and I' ll break it its neck -Beethoven-

With the help of the heroine Sarah Conner ( Linda Hamilton) from the original movie, she with John & The Terminator have to prevent an upcoming war that will lead to the future and must outdo the T-1000.

A sequel that works higher than the original movie which was a classic by the way. James Cameron with Arnold have returned in this highly expensive sequel that was probably the costliest movie in Carolco's history, however when it opened on July 2 1991 it has became one of the highest grossing movies of time with critical acclaim and academy awards for best make-up, best special effects, and best editing. What truly made it a new action/sci-fi classic is that the film contained unbelivable special effects by ILM for it's time like no one has ever seen before, great acting, flawless direction & writing by James Cameron, non-stop action and heart to go with the movie.

This movie hooked me from the opening scene and even Arnold's stiff sounding dialogue was perfect for the cyborg he was playing!

The chase scenes and narrow escapes had my heart pounding throughout the film!

There were many scenes in this film that were firsts for movies such as Arnold removing a damaged robotic eyeball, seeing how the robot mind decided on what dialogue to say and having a robot disguise their voice to sound exactly like a dead human!

This was John Cameron's second to last good film(True Lies) befor he went to direct the Titanic, a crappy soap opera that shoulda sank like the ship.  Well anyway enough about that, this was James Camron's best film so far.(He coulda made Terminator 3 everything it shoulda been, but NOO he and Linda Hamilton go there seprete ways and he won't direct it.  He still coulda directed it tho!)

Special Effects are crazy, and high budget material.  Seeing a man made of liquid metal, go through things, regenerate, and get holes in him every time he got shot, is pretty freakin' amazing.  I mean the special effects were something thats still looks good today, even after 14 years.

Arnold being the good guy was just like whoa, ok this isn't what I was expecting, I was expecting for him to get payback, but hey beggers can't be chosers, but T-1000 was just the perfect machine, 800X better than the terminatrix in Terminator 3 which was composed of liquid metal and machinery.  That's retarted.  Liquid Metal is nealy invincable, but with macheniery inside it can easily be destroyed.  I gotta stop, cuz this is not a review for Terminator 3.  Anyway, Robert Patrick's performance was great, but it would have been cool to see Sylvester Stallone as him.  2 terminators, 2 of hollywoods bigest macho actors Jam packed in 1 freakin' movie.

This movie surpasses the 1st in just so many ways, it's almost a perfect improvment!  Anyone interested in Sci-Fi had to have sceene this.  Anyone who usally hates dissapointing sequals ex. Matrix Reloaded, this will nearly make you forget about the first one.

2135774,4,B0002WYTWG,"""The Terminator"" is the first installment of one of the best Sci-Fi franchises, but this movie not only is one of the best Sci-Fi movies that you can find, it's also one of the best action movies as well. The story in this movie is so clever that it doesn't matter if some of the visual effects look outdated today, or if some music tracks sound kinda silly, because the plot of this movie must be the most intelligent story about machines.

The main characters have a lot of depth, specially when we are talking about robots. Arnold Schwarzenegger is just perfect for the role of a killer cyborg that travels from the future whose mission is to kill Sarah Connor, the woman that eventually will give birth to John Connor, the leader of the humanity in an apocalyptic future. Sounds cool, doesn't it?

Linda Hamilton plays the role of Sarah Connor, a young woman living a simple live, and overnight she becomes the target of Arnie. At the beginning of the film she is kinda sweet and shy, but at the end of the day she becomes a survivor, fighting for her life and for the life of her unborn child. Sarah Connor is one of the toughest movie heroines that you will ever see (specially in the sequel).

Michael Biehn is also great as Kyle Reese, a warrior that travels from the future to protect Sarah from Arnie. And of course Schwarzenegger found the role of a lifetime in the Terminator franchise, nobody else could fit in this role like Arnie. James Cameron also built a strong reputation with this film, Cameron is one of the best directors in the Sci-Fi or action genres, also he knows a lot of stuff about technical aspects like visual effects and action sequences.

The action sequences are jaw-dropping and thrilling, check out the high speed chases, and of course, the final battle. ""The Terminator"" is one of the best Sci-Fi movies, it doesn't matter if some visual effects look dated, because the story will test the proof of time, like the good wines.",1104624000,,1962,4.565340909090909

2135777,5,B0002WYTWG,"There are several reasons why the first Terminator was and still is better than its sequels.

  First of all, even if one sees it now, 20 years after its original release it still holds its ground with particular tech-noir ease. It doesn't look dated and it actually gains charm as time goes by rather than lose any.

  Then it's also the ""feel"" this film has. It still retains this unmistakable ""indie film"" quality allthough for its time back then it was definetely high budget. All the dark, industrial superbly edited scenes contribute to that feeling, and J.Cameron did a memorable job creating a film that was expensive but kept you watching not because of ultra-flashy effects, but because of an intriguing storyline, great directing, good to very good performances, and cool visuals.

  Speaking of the storyline, in T1 it happens to be more consistent and solid than in the following Terminator installments. It's a solid script deserving of a classic sci-fi film, one that puts the T1 in a pantheon of great futuristic films.

  Its superiority lies also in the fact that T1 is dark and ominously threatening in its entirety. The coldness and the relentlessness of the cyborg is its trademark sign and that's what sets its unique atmosphere. If it has lost something is that fact that the back-then not so famous protagonist has since become a megastar and a governor on top of it. This takes somewhat away from the charm of not being familiar with the actors but it's ultimately not enough to harm the film.

  Cameron kept the effects at a minimum and yet managed to give his film a dominant aura of technological-doom. He used more industrial visuals of the present than of the future to achieve this and he was succesful by a good margin. It was after all one of his very best films.

  The Terminator's machoism is well disguised underneath its fake skin and Arnold was a perfect cast for this role. He wasn't consumed enough back then to be taken in as funny even if he delivered lines like ""I'll be back"" or pronounces names with a German accent (Sarah Cannah anyone?).

""The Terminator"" introduced us to Arnold Schwarzenegger as the indestructible killing machine...and made him and Cameron superstars. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" continues the story of Sarah and John Connor's fight against the machines. ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" is a worthy sequel to this movie, taking the story to its inevitable conclusion, promising another sequel, which I hope Arnold returns for. ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" and ""I'll Be Back"" (featured in the first film) are classic lines from the movies which have permeated our everyday jargon. Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.

""THE TERMINATOR""

In the first installment of the series which would skyrocket Schwarzenegger and Cameron to fame, Arnold plays The Terminator, an unstoppable killing machine sent back through time. Michael Biehn (""Meggido,"" ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss"") plays Kyle Reese, a man sent back through time to 1984 L.A. to Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton, who would return for the 2nd movie, reviewed here) with a mission and message for her. Arnold, who was almost an unknown at the time, delivers a strong performance as the title character, the unstoppable killing cyborg sent to destroy both Sarah and-I'm not going to spoil it. A killer-perfect performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger (who would rise to fame, along with James Cameron) along with the rest of the cast, the score by Brad Fiedel (who would return to score the next film in the series), the widescreen format (enhanced for 16X9 TV's) and the AWESOME sound mix make this film definitely worth having.
Rated PG-13 for violence, language and brief sexuality/nudity.

2135780,5,B0002WYTWG,"There are three versions of this movie on this 2-disc DVD:
Theatrical Version
Special Edition
Extended Special Edition (Also known as the Orginial Uncut Version)

The extended special edition is an easter egg, and that is the version with 20 minutes of additional footage, not 16 minutes. It is extremely hard to get to. It contains a new ending and extra footage.

The new footage cut from the theatrical version is described below:

Chapter 10: Ain't no Trouble

This new scene shows two prison guards beating Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) up because she refuses to take her medicine. This scene was cut because it took a long time to shoot and she was getting very mad at one of the prison guards because he kept messing up and it took a total of 20 takes or something. She later got her revenge on him later in the movie.

Chapter 13: There is not much time left in the World

This is another scene that was cut from the theatrical release because this was something that made the film too long. But what is interesting about this new scene is that it has a character from the first movie, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) of whom was never in the theatrical version of Terminator 2. The scene is a dream scene, and it shows the two characters hugging and kissing, then Kyle walks away. Sarah chases him down the hallway, yelling ""Kyle, don't go!"" Then she goes through some double doors and ends up at a playground. Then, at the end of the scene, it shows the nuclear blast and then, Sarah wakes up from her dream.

Chapter 20

This is a new scene showing the T-1000 stealing a policeman's car after the explosion of the tow truck chase.

Chapter 24

This is a new scene of the T-1000 killing John Connor's dog, and finding out that The Terminator and John are aware of his whereabouts.

Chapter 37

New dialogue is added to this scene.

Chapter 38

This new scene is where the Terminator, John and Sarah open up and take out the Terminator's chip, therefore shutting him down. Then, Sarah knows she can't destroy the actual Terminator, but, she can destroy this little, fragile chip that is like the on/off switch for the Terminator. John stops her from trying to destroy the chip with a hammer. He convices her not to do it, and she finally listens to him. SO, she doesn't destroy the chip, and they put it back in the Terminator's skull. This scene was cut because this took about three months to film this one scene.

Chapter 39

This new scene is a scene when John teaches the Terminator how to smile. This scene is hilarious, because when thew Terminator tries to smile, it looks like he is smiling like a horse. This scene also has a new character for the movie, and the person is the woman John Connor (Edward Furlong) says ""nice place you got here"" and the new character, being the cashier (played by Nancy Fish) says, ""gimme a break"".

Chapter 41

This new scene introduces Miles Dyson (Joe Morton)'s family. It is a scene where it introduces another character to the movie,  and that is Dyson's daughter, who was never seen in the thatrical version. This scene was cut because when Sarah tries to kill Dyson, and Dyson's son was available for shooting the film, but his daughter wasn't.

Chapter 43

This is an extended scene where additional dialogue between Sarah and her friend Enrique. And, the other part of the extended scene is John talking about how he lives, and it also show him handling large assault weapons. This scene was cut because Cameron did not want to show a kid handling large scale weapons.

Chapter 49

This extended scene has additonal dialogue of the Terminator and John talking to each other while the Terminator drives to the Dyson house.

Chapter 50

This extended scene shows Sarah stalking Dyson.

Chapter 55

This new scene shows Dyson, Sarah and the Terminator destroying all of Dyson's equipment.

Chapter 67

This is an extended scene showing the T-1000 malfunctioning.

Chapter 75

This is an extended scene of which there are two Sarahs, yet one of them is the real Sarah. This extended scene shows which one is the real Sarah and the fake Sarah. What it shows is that the fake Sarah (the T-1000)'s feet are also malfunctioning, so that is how John could tell beteween the two.

SCENES ONLY IN EXTENDED SPECIAL EDITION

These two scenes are very hard to see, so here is a description.

Chapter 24

This is the uncut sequence of the T-1000 at John's foster parents' home. The added footage shows the T-1000 searching John's room.

Chapter 79

This is the orginial ending  for Terminator 2. It is set in the year 2029 and it shows a much older Sarah, now being 64; and a much older John, playing with his daugher at a playground. It also shows Sarah speaking into a voice recorder.",1100476800,,4725,4.561091340450771

Buy this DVD for the stunning quality and the Ultimate edition for the features, (although I believe this one has the better commentary). Director Cameron's scientific/technical grasp is quite apparent throughout the commentary and I enjoyed his sense of humour.

But this time his mission is to stop an even deadlier Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made entirely of shape-shifting liquid metal and determined to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. Sarah, John, and the Terminator counter by going after the scientist responsible for developing Skynet, the computer system fated to destroy humanity, leading to an explosive and spectacular clash with the fate of humanity in the balance. Whereas James Cameron's original THE TERMINATOR was a low-budget marvel of efficiency and speed, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is an action-packed blockbuster with some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed and ground-breaking, Academy Award-winning special effects. Star Schwarzenegger was paid in the form of a $15 million dollar jet to revisit his most famous role as the Terminator, this time made kinder and gentler against the silent, relentless T-1000. One of the most popular films of the 1990s, James Cameron's action masterpiece is both a thoughtful look at violence in human nature and an exciting, nonstop thrill ride.",1098576000,,1295,5.545454545454546

Originally James Cameron's most famous project besides ""Titanic"",

""The AByss"" and other hits almost never got made. All the major

movie studies to Fox to Paramount rejected it as shown on the

E Special behind the scenes. Then came ""Orion Picturez"" yes

the same Orion who also distributed the famous Robocop with Peter

Weller.

Orion not a household name deserves a ton of credit for giving

the best scifi movie in the 80's.

We have seen from then on a multitude of Terminator copied

movies, but this one started it all.

A cyborg from the future is sent in to kill SarAH Conner

(Linda Hamilton who also married Cameron) because Sarah will

give birth to John Conner a leader who in the future will fight

back against the deadly cyborgs like Terminator.

Meanwhile a soldier from the future, Kyle Reese (Michael Bien)

is sent in to save Sarah and make sure she gives birth to John

Connor.

Wow, visually speaken this is the best looking scifi film

since Star Wars. Cameron spent an enormous budget and put

onscreen for us.

The ever thickening plot, surrounding a vision that robots from the future will, one day, rule the world, and lead mankind into a deathly destruction, features the T2000 robot prototype, who is brought to this Earth to save the innocent humans on the planet. This film is sentimental, in some parts, as the T2000 has absolutely no sense of conscience, love or compassion. Therefore, he will kill whenever he thinks that something is wrong. Moreover, the child who is being protected by this ultrahuman - a yob, and a criminal youth at that - is made somewhat kinder, as the film progresses, as it is only his responsibility to teach the learning robot humanity. This film is definitely violent, with scenes of death, violence and murder enraging the viewer with fright and deep worry, though it is usually the 'good' characters who get the better of the camera, as is conventional with all violent films like this. I believe that this movie is somewhat a little too violent, though the sentimentality included in the way the younger characters teach humanity and manners is a lesson for us all: only use violence in absolute desperation.

2135793,5,B0002WYTWG,"I know most people proclaim Terminator 2 as the best of the trilogy.....however, my favorte will always be this little masterpiece for a couple of simple reasons:

 1. James Cameron got his continuity right. The basic theme in the movie is: you cannot change the future, you can only hope to survive it. Everything someone does to alter the future will in turn, cause these events to occur. He carried this theme over to T2, but only halfway. But that's something I'll get into when I review that movie.

 2. Whereas T2 and T3 were 'sci-fi/action' movies, the original Terminator was straight up 'sci-fi/horror'. The atmosphere in this movie is phenomenal and conveys the feeling of impending doom more clearly than the sequals.

 In T2 when the T-1000 is chasing after the T-800/John Conner/Sarah Conner, you're thinking, ""Oh, man...they better run or they're screwed. I hope we get to see the two terminators fight again. That was sweet."" But when the T-800 is stalking Sarah Conner through the police station in the original Terminator, we feel only despair for the characters. Never before has a man been so convincing as a machine. So cold and lifeless, yet moving with an uncontrollable desire to destroy anything that moves. That single sequence in Terminator was far unsettling and dramatic than anything I saw in the sequals.

 In T3 when the T-800 gets his head knocked off and is only hanging by a few cables, we're thinking, ""Oh, wow...she took his head off."" or, ""Hey, that's photo-realistic."" But remember the bathroom scene in the original? Remember how freakin' scary that was? A damp, barely lit, grungy bathroom in a parking garage....a giant of a man stoicly slicing open his arm and PULLING OUT HIS OWN EYE. Yeah, even though the animatronic Arnold head looked extremely fake, the atmosphere was extremely creepy. I'll take style over photorealistic CGI any day.

 I think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealed the true form of the Terminator. Piece by piece he loses a chunk here, a chunk there. You know he's a machine with flesh over his endo-skeleton, but the full force of this implication isn't really felt until you see the machine without the flesh emerge from burning wreckage. I find the scene where the endo-skeleton is lurching very quickly toward the door as Sarah is struggling to close it far more terrifying than the whole Terminator apocalypse scenes in the sequals. But then again, those are action movies. This original is a true sci-fi masterpiece and is probably the best sci-fi/horror film in existence second only to maby the original Alien.",1091577600,,2609,4.895691609977324
2135794,5,B0002WYTWG,"This film showed Arnold at his highest peak, with the baddest attitude ever, unstoppable and causing devastation. The terminator is the best as a bad guy, because that makes him such a love-to-hate villian, hoping the good guys win but still rooting the terminator on.

 The terminator, flesh on the outside, but underneath is all computerized, is programmed to track you down, no matter where you are, and will stop at nothing until you are dead. The terminator's nonstop chaos causes you to remain focused, and it creates a certain stamina inside of you cheering for the terminator and a special liking for the fact that he is indestructable.

 ""Sarah Conner"" is all he said to the few women that he blew away, while looking for the real Sarah, mother of John Conner. They set the plot well. Especially that one part when Kyle was describing Sarah's son to her, who he knew from the 2020's, which made Sarah say: Now I know what to name him. What they were obviously saying in the plot was that Kyle was supposedly John's father, since Kyle and Sarah made love when he met her, in present time. This was way before the future, when Kyle met John and was fighting the machines.

 This film has special effects that makes the battle scenes ten times more wicked, my favorite was when Arnold was on fire in mid air and punched through the windshield. All the costly special effects are only useful when the terminator is a bad guy, which is one of the reasons why I liked the first terminator so much better than the sequel.

2135798,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is the best Terminator movie in Arnold Schwarzenegger's retrospect. In the first film Arnold Schwarzenegger is the super cool-factor. He is handsome, masculine, super-strong, seemingly indistuctable, rebellion young appearance Terminator, but most of all, he is bad with a serious 'no body gets in my way' attitude problem.

In the second film he has the same rebellion look, he is still masculine, he looks less youthful and more middle aged, he is no longer seemingly super-strong, he is no longer seemingly indistructable, but worst of all he is no longer bad and his attitude has improved, he now has obstacles that stand in his way.

His cool-factor is completely over powered by the T-1000.
His super-strength is over powered by the T-1000.
His youth is replaced and over powered by the T-1000.
His rebellion look, doesn't seem to matter anymore, thanks to the T-1000.

The third film looks even worse for Arnold, as he is over powered by an arguably less impressive Terminator or ""Terminatrix"" than the T-1000. Arnold's age really does show an older man that has had his age doubled since his characters first appearance. He once again admit's he is ""out-dated"" and that she or ""it"" is a more powerful and far more effective killing machine than himself. Once again HE must struggle to survive as he is decapitated and almost dismemebered, as also with the T-1000. This truly waves his original 'nothing stands in my way' factor in to extinction, or what should I say, Termination.

You can see how they turned it around on poor Arnold, and you can see how the first original and as some would say, ""the best"" Terminator film puts Arnold in the ever so cool spotlight, that is taken away a couple of years later and then again over a decade later. Even with the so-called ""upgraded"" T-X, the T-1000 arguably proves to be the best Terminator of all time...

Yeah, ok, we all know the T-101 isn't the best terminator to date... mechanically speaking...

... but which terminator killed the most people??...

... the T-1000 & the T-X killed around 5 people each...

... but the T-101 killed over 20 people... on his own...

... makes you think...

In the end, the T-101 turned out to be the worst terminator, with the highest body count.",1089763200,,2246,4.780361757105943
2135799,5,B0002WYTWG,"We are all too familiar with the story of this movie, so I will spare you the details. ""The Terminator"" was a sleeper sci-fi hit that was a rarity in its genre. Movie-goers were beginning to see sci-fi films that rose above others in the genre and even other genres. ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Star Wars"", and, the film that started the revolution, ""2001: A Space Odyessy"". What made ""Terminator"" so different was not just another bleak view of the future, but a tense, edgy thriller with some damn fine writing. But while it took an effort to make films like those, it took a greater one to make a sequel. ""Aliens"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and very few others accomplished this task successfully. As for ""T2"", unless you've been living under a rock, we all know how well it did. This is definitely the best of the series (in my opinion at least) and definitely one of the best action movies to grace the face of our planet. This is the movie that also started the trend of making action movies with ridiculously huge budgets and paying action stars ridiculously huge salaries. But T2 delivers, with a great story, stunning visuals, and Schwarzenegger in his prime. Plus who can forget Brad Fiedel's synthetic score which has been parodied numerous times?
Why another DVD though? This film has been put on DVD almost as many times as ""Independence Day"". Special features are somewhat reserved here, so what justifies another release? DVD producer Van Ling answers the question in a quaint little insert about how new technology has developed since the last T2 transfer. They can now present T2 the way it should be, digitally mastered from a 1080p, 24sf digital telecline transfer for ""superior video and audio quality"". This release of T2 is aimed toward the home theater crowd. All that confusing talk means that the picture is presented with more clarity.
And the sound is just awesome. The DTS track has been dropped from the ""Ultimate Edition"" in exchange for a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX track and a Dolby headphone track. If you have the technology, try to watch a DVD with a DTS track whenever possible. In the case of this DVD, there's only the Dolby 5.1 EX track. But the track on this ""Extreme DVD"" defies both the Dolby and DTS tracks from the ""Ultimate Edition"". It takes full advantage of a dimensional sound field.
The goodies here are minimal; a SFX documentary, a behind the scenes montage, and a few DVD-ROM goodies that I didn't bother to try. But there is the original version of the film available to Windows Media Player 9 users on the second disc. You can watch it on the first disc as well, it's disguised as an easter egg. On the main menu of Disc 1, hit the right button five times while highlighting ""Play Extended Version"". There's also an enhanced mode with behind the scnes and there's a spankin new commentary by James Cameron himself.
But the question remains; is this DVD worth buying? It really boils down to what your reasons are for buying this new DVD. If you don't own the film, yes. If you're troubled by the mediocre video quality of either of the first two releases, then yes. If you want Cameron's commentary and other new supplements, yes. And if you want to playback T2 in HD on your PC (and even if you find that your computer equipment is currently insufficient for HD playback), yes. But if you want extensive behind the scenes, you might want to stick with your ""Ultimate Edition"". This ""Extreme Edition"" delivers though, despite falling short in the behind the scenes section.",1089676800,,3530,4.685990338164252

2135804,5,B0002WYTWG,"Boy, is this a great movie.  It was when it hit the theaters more than a decade ago, and it still is.  Armed with a multi-million dollar budget and an arsenal of state-of-the-art special effects, director James Cameron puts together a sci-fi thriller that thoroughly entertains from beginning to end.
But the true beauty of TERMINATOR 2 is its undying loyalty and respect for its predecessor, made some eight years before.  Even though there was such a gap in time, Cameron remained faithful to his original production, which translates into a seamless and believable sequel.  The T-800 machine, the nemesis in the original ""Terminator,"" returns, only this time the cyborg has been programmed to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), now a pre-adolescent.  And once again, Schwarzenegger was made for the role of the T-800:  a stoic, hulking, violent killing machine, yet this time, Arnold brings a discreet sense of humor and compassion to the part.
Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, young mother of John, but now she's buffed and tough and ready to fight back.  And Robert Patrick is exceptional as the advanced T-1000 Model, the machine programmed to kill John--a machine so advanced it makes the T-800 look like an old Commodore PC.  The action, the effects, the story, are spellbinding, but again, the subtle and not-so-subtle parallels to the original ""Terminator"" are what impressed me the most.  The title of this review is but one example, as it was said by the protectors in both movies--and prophetically so.  There are many, many more, which make TERMINATOR 2 so faithful to its predecessor, and so darned fun to watch.

Schwarzenegger is absolutely perfect as an unemotional cyborg that travels back in time to 1984 to ""terminate"" a young woman (Linda Hamilton) destined to give birth to a man who ultimately will lead humans against the machines of the 21st Century.  Arnold brings his ""A"" game to this role, effectively portraying a brutal, stoic, ruthless killing machine that will stop at nothing to achieve its mission.  Hamilton as the constantly running victim is very good at screaming and looking terrified, while Michael Biehn is solid as her futuristic ""protector.""
As entertaining as this movie is, the special effects are dated and quite laughable by today's standards.  Equally as laughable are the hairstyles, including a brief appearance by a spike-haired Bill Paxton.  Yet the flaws are overcome by the action and nonstop thrills, as Cameron showed the world he is a filmmaker to be reckoned with.  And I reckon I'm darn glad to have THE TERMINATOR in my video collection.

2135808,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is one of the greatest action sci-fi films ever made. It has one of the best performances of Arnold Schwarzenegger's historic carear.
In 1984 the world is safe. Safe that is until The Terminator(Schwarzenegger) appears and stars killing woman. He's looking for Sarah Connor(Hamilton). He's been sent from the year 2029 to kill Sarah Connor the mother of the son she hasn't had yet who will one day stop the machines. The Terminator is a cyborg. He has a skin outside with a metal exo-skeleton and he has one purpose....to kill.
Sarah knows she is in trouble and she's scared. She meets up with Kyle Reese(Biehn) who warns her of the danger. She is skeptic at first but goes with Kyle. The Terminator will not stop however and Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop this killing machine before it kills them.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is the man in this film. He was originally cast to play Kyle, but after he read the script he said wanted the part of the bad guy. He plays it to perfection. He has very few lines in the film, but he is terrifying in the movie. The whole look with the glasses and leather jackets and with Arnolds body makes one of the best bad guys ever. Actions speak louder than words in this movie. Arnold really is good enough in the moive to earn an Oscar nomination. You don't think they will ever take him down in the film, and the ending is great.
Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor. This is one of the best performances of her carear as well. If it weren't for Hamilton in this movie and Weaver in Aliens we wouldn't have the big woman action thriller that we have today. You like her in this a lot and she's even better in T2.
The special effects are great in this movie. James Cameron's movies have always had great special effects Terminator is no exception. The movie is made so well. James Cameron really is the man and this guy really does deserve more credit in Hollywood. Very few directors over the years have made movies that are consistently good and Cameron has never made a bad film. He also needs credit for writing this masterpiece of a film.
The Terminator is one of the greatest films ever made. It's a huge movie and especially with pop culture today. It's stood the test of time. The famous line ""I'll be Back"" is from this movie, but it's always been here. If you haven't seen this movie you must go pick it up and watch it. If you have and don't own it, go buy it now.",1085702400,,2432,4.370860927152318
2135809,5,B0002WYTWG,"This story of pre-apocalyptic murder and mayhem is still the thrill-ride it was when I first saw it in the theater in the mid-80's. While some of the effects look dated (not to mention the night-club fashions), this still holds up as a piece of low-budget/guerrilla film-making that transcends the genre.
More than just a monster-of-the-week gorefest, The Terminator manages to create characters you care about, characters - Sarah Connor in particular - who actually, and believably, mature over the course of the movie. Although it falls into the ""gorefest"" category, Stan Winston & crew manage to put together some gut-wrenchingly realistic moments during the Terminator's self-surgery scenes.
In addition to the movie in full- and wide-screen formats, the DVD also includes the original mono soundtrack and a new 5.1 stereo version. While the sound effects are better in the stereo version, the dialogue frequently sounds washed out under headphones - an actual surround-sound system may perform better, I don't know. There are a couple nice documentaries, and the production artwork is actually worth checking out (James Cameron's days in Roger Corman's art department really show here). About all that's missing are cast and crew commentaries, but a lot of that kind of content is included in the documentaries.
If you've never seen The Terminator, you're missing one of greatest sci-fi/horror films of all times. This movie, Alien(s), and Blade Runner exemplify the Tech-Noir movement of the Eighties. That nothing has come close to rivaling them in the past decade and a half demonstrates how good these movies are. Check 'em out.",1085184000,,1637,5.251908396946565

2135815,5,B0002WYTWG,"Just so you know, this review is for the Ultimate Edition, not the badly reviewed Extreme dvd.  I'm gonna start this review with a little history.  Terminator 2 has been my favorite movie of all time.  It was a yr ago when I had first got a dvd player and my brother and I decided that one day in the future, we will own the ultimate edition of T2.  We would have bought it right if we had not already owned it the movie on video.  It was not that long after that I heard that Artisan was releasing a new edition of T2 called ""The Extreme DVD"".  We thought about getting that after seeing that it might be good.  But after hearing all the negative reviews, we decided to stick with the Ultimate.  But there was a problem; The Ultimate Edition was going out of stock.  Soon on every market shelf, there was The Extreme Dvd in place of where the Ultimate edition used to be.  I guess we can say that the Extreme had taken over.
One day over the summer, I was at a store and for fun, I decided to check if there Ultimate edition in stock.  As predicted, the shelf was full of Extreme dvd's, but under the huge pile of dvd's there was ONE Ultimate edition of T2.  It may have been the last one available in the whole state so I bought right away.  At first, I was a bit disappointed with the dvd.  One reason was because I had first owned the movie on video so I asked myself ""Did I really have to buy this movie"".  I know the video was old and the picture was a little blurry but it was still in decent condition.  I felt like I wasted my money.  Also it's a widescreen.  I know 99 percent of people prefer widescreen but I like full screen (but I am willing to look past that). But after a while, I decided to explore the dvd and realize that it's a great dvd.  Hell, it may be the best dvd in the world.  It has got so much stuff on just one disc!  It has many documentaries on it, cast and crew info, audio commentary, 2 versions of the film, Dolby Digital 5.1 surround ex, DTS 5.1 ex, trailors, dolby surround 2.0, over 700 story boards, entire screenplay, lots of features that include the making of t2 from make-p to visual effects, and the animated dvd menus are really cool and much more.  Enough about that, here is the plot.
Its been about ten years since the events of the first film.  The Skynet and machines of the future want to once again to attempt to eliminate the leader of the human resistance, John Conner.  They now send a more advanced terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick).  This thing is made up of liquid metal and can imitate anything it touches by physical contact as long as its something of equal size and it something that doesn't have moving parts; like a machine, ex-. a gun.  It can form solid metal shapes, ex- a knife.  The humans too have sent a terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and programmed it to protect John (Edward Furlong).  He first must find John, and then help get his mom Sarah (Linda Hamilton) out of a mental hospital.  It is said that somewhere between the time after the first movie and before the second movie, Sarah tried to stop the existence of Skynet by destroying the company who will build it.  She was stopped and sent to the psychiatric clinic for he stories of the ""machine from the future"".  After getting her out, the 3 then go on a quest to once again try to prevent the existence of by stopping the computer genius Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), who will eventually build it.  At the same time, they must also keep John alive and away from the deadly T-1000.
Anyway, T2 has to be the greatest movie of all time and I am happy have it on the ultimate dvd.  For those of you who are reading this, if your not happy with you Extreme dvd, then I think you should tell Artisan to re-release the Ultimate Edition b/c I am sure that will everybody happy.",1080950400,,3808,4.251738525730181
2135816,5,B0002WYTWG,"NOTE: The movie I watched was a cleaned-up version that deleted swear words, sex scene, and any of the very gory violence without compromising the story line, so I cannot vouch for the content of the actual film--I would strongly advise looking into the content before seeing it. As a Christian I would advise against watching an unedited version.
Now for the actual review:
  Few people haven't heard of the Terminator, and with the 3rd of its series having hit theatres several months back, the cyborg thing is in fashion once again.
  And it's famous for good reason. From the first chilling images of a charred and ruined Los Angeles to the same metropolis some 45 years earlier, this film is thoroughly excellent.
  The plot is intrisically simple, and therefore chilling and effective for that very reason. Computers had developed artificial intelligence and, in the year 1997, caused a nuclear holocaust that destroyed 3 billion human lives. Those humans who survived became locked in an epic battle for survival against nearly indestructible enemies, led by one man: John Connor. Eventually they get into a position where the defeat of the machines is imminent, and mankind will be restored to its proper place.
  In a bid to reverse the tide of the war, Skynet, the computer system responsible for the war, sends a machine back in time--a Terminator, a computer system with a metal skeleton and surrounded by human tissue created for one thing--death. It's mission is to kill John Connor's mother, Sarah, at all costs, and thereby indirectly depriving the human resistance of its leader. Lacking human emotion or remorse, this terminator, perfectly played by monotonal Arnold Scharzenneger, sets out on its mission with relentless purpose.
  The humans, knowing of the machine's plans, manage to send one of their own back through time--a human soldier named Kyle Reese, who has been ordered to defend Sarah from the terminator.
  They both reach the year 1984 at approximately the same time, and from there begins an epic struggle for Sarah's survival.
  The plot is helped immensely by the directing of James Cameron, which is quite superb. He uses slow motion extensively, but for such a film this is no problem, and it turns out to be quite effective.
  Everything about the terminator itself is done quite realistically--it has no sudden relapses into remorse. The only time is spares people is when its purposes are foiled by external circumstances. And, of course, Schwarzenneger is the perfect choice for such a role. It would be hard to make the case that he is a good actor--but he doesn't need to be for this role, and he can exude such a sense of cold, thoughtless machinery that few if any other actors could have taken his part and equalled or improved it.
  The terminator is the center of attention, but Sarah Connor is the lynch-pin of the film, for her death would, at least in the confines of the movie plot, spell the end (or termination) of the human race. A good actress is important for such a key role, and Linda Hamilton certainly does a good job, even though she, at about 28, was playing a 19 year-old. It is completely natural for Sarah to be incredulous and disbelieving at the notion of a machine like a terminator, and Hamilton protrays this well.
  The digital effects obviously are not completely up-to-date, since the movie was made in 1984, but no movie can be expected to upgrade itself for the changing times, and for the time they were quite good. The only part that comes across as fairly corny is when the terminator loses his outer skin to show himself as he is underneath--a creepy looking metal skeleton. However this was done on the film, its movement comes across as rather shaky--the the sheer effect of a skeletal terminator still pursuing his mission even after being in the middle of a semi explosion is good enough, and the failings of the special effects can be overlooked.
  And certainly the action sequences are tremendous. Reese's desperate defense against the blazing guns of the terminator--who, caring not a whit for human life, kills whoever stands in his way--makes for a wide array of tense and suspensful scenes.
  All-in-all a superb film, except for the fact that Reese and Connor end up producing John illegitimately. I didn't see it in the cleaned-up version, obviously, but even knowing it's there doesn't please me. I can't prevent anyone from seeing it as it is, of course, but I do give them my word of caution that there is a good deal of bad content.
  But if you see it edited, it's an superb film!",1080864000,,4580,4.809948979591836
2135817,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator2 is the best movie that I was moved. Though I love Terminator1 too, love 2 more. More than 10 years passed sinse this movie was roadshowed, but I don't feel that the work is out of day. One of the reasons will be what the work was used computer grafic, for instance the newest terminator, Requid Metal was burn and got to requid by heat, the scene was real and wonderful scene used so great computer grafic that I can not believe more than 10 years ago.
Off course in Japan too the movie was big hit movie.
The battle of T800 and T1000 was scenes that was moved me, the reality, exciting, the scene broken wall by their attacking, by shot-gun the scene that penetrate T1000....
Now even, this work will be not inferior to other movies.

2135818,5,B0002WYTWG,"I haven't read all 531 reviews here as of this writing, but most everyone seems to focus on the 2nd DVD with the Hi-Def content. I actually bought the Extreme DVD for the high def content, but then decided the set was worth it for the 1st DVD alone.
The 1st DVD disc has two things that totally thrilled me. An interactive mode which completely details all the special effects on screen and lets you break-away at several key-points to hear about sound, special effects and production notes from many of the people involved in the film. To me this is much more compelling than a Director's narrative.
The other thing that totally blew me away on the 1st DVD is the Dolby Headphone Soundtrack. I've heard many headphone oriented surround technologies, but nothing like this. The sound over headphones is truely awesome. If I din't know I was watching a movie I would absolutely think the dogs barking in one particular scene were outside my condo. I actually prefer it to listening to the soundtrack over my thousand dollar speaker system.
One other note the picture quality of the 1st DVD seems signifigantly better than the quality of the origional DVD release of T2. I often found it hard to beleive I was watching a DVD.
I didn't consider myself a huge T2 fan before I bought this DVD, but it has defintely made me a bigger one. The high-def content is nice, but it doesn't make the set in my opinion.",1080691200,,1404,4.553359683794467
2135819,1,B0002WYTWG,I'm really disapoined to see that a new format supported by Artisan and Microsoft have a downloadble Trailer that can run here in Brazil and the Extreme DVD cannot.. Why that? Do they have plans to make a Brazilian version of this High Definition movie? I think not... They should allow all the world to see the DVD or to create many region DVDs to the other countries...,1079568000,,371,4.470588235294118
2135820,3,B0002WYTWG,"A caution about this version of T2. The second disc of this 2 dvd set is recorded in encrypted Microsoft Windows Media 9 format. I purchased it based on my very favorable experience with ""Coral Reef Adventure"" (also on dual dvd and WM9 Hi-Def dvd formats).
For those not familiar with the WM9 Hi-Def format, it will only playback on a Windows XP computer with the latest version of Windows Media 9 installed. Furthermore, the disc will insist on installing the InterActual DVD Player, version 2.0. This, would be OK, in my opinion, were it not for the fact that: (1) the installation of the player requires an update, which, in turn, requires that IE6 be your default browser; if not, you get into an endless loop trying to install the update from a non-windows browser like Mozilla Firefox or Opera; and (2) unless you are under 13 year of age, the InterActual player insists on collecting ""annonymous"" demograpic info every time you play this ""hi-def"" version of the film. It also insists on the user providing his correct email address, zipcode, sex and age! Of course, you could provide misinformation here. Having paid good money for this 2 disc set, I see no justification, at all, for any form of snooping on my viewing habits - annonymous or not. Nor do I see why I should be forced to provide info about myself. If this doesn't change ASAP, this will be the last time I buy any Microsoft Hi-Def movie disc.
The WM9 Hi-Def version of this film is only minimally better than the standard dvd version on disc 1. On a good playback system using a decent progressive dvd player with component output to a good plasma or CRT monitor, I think the standard dvd displays about 98% of what you see on the so called ""Hi-Def"" version on disc 2, and you don't have to jump through hoops to install it and be annoyed by unwelcomed snooping of your viewing habits. Interestingly, another hi-def flick using WM9 called ""Coral Reef Adventure"" doesn't have any of the drawbacks of T2, and is an awesome hi-def experience at either 720P or 1080P. ""Coral Reef Adventure"" is very highly recommend and does not require installation of the InterActual Player. Also, Coral Reef Adventure will show you what a difference there is between the standard 480i dvd version and the 720P/1080P Hi-Def version - provided you have the right equipment(for 720P you will need a 2.4 GHz cpu; 4x AGP video card and monitor that can display 1280x720. For 1080P, you'll need a 3.0+ GHZ cpu; 8x AGP video card and monitor than can display 1920x1080.
As for T2 - Extreme Edition, if you must have this version, skip disc 2 and watch disc 1 only, better yet, buy T2-Ultimate Edition instead.
I give disc 1 - 4 stars for the film and display quality.
I give disc 2 - 2 stars because of the difficulty created by Microsoft's Draconian installation and the InterActual Player's unappreciated demand for any form of user personal information and ""annonymous"" demographic snooping.",1079481600,,2942,4.692456479690522

I also really like audio commentary by Cameron. I really shouldnt call T2 Extreme another edition of T2, because really & honestly it's more of an extenstion to T2 Ultimate, on the 2nd disc all you'll find is 2 new documentaries and DVD ROM features, not like the Ultimate which has more features than you can count.

2135825,5,B0002WYTWG,"In the year 2029 there takes place a war between man and machine. Skynet is the name of the cybornetic force trying to wipe out human kind. When Skynet is on the brink of extinction a T-1800 a.k.a a Terminator. It's mission is to wipe out the mother of John Conner, the leader of the human race. Sarah Conner (John Conner's Mother) is a normal 80's chick, she has a boyfriend who keeps on telling her to amke a raincheck on their dates. She lives with a roommate and has a pet lizard life is good. Then the Terminator is sent back to 1984 (the time in which she is living in). At that same time a human warrior from the future has come to protect her, Kyle Reese. Not knowing what he really is against he takes all precasions neccessary. The real battle of future fate of man doesn't take place in the future but in the past.
In my opinion this is Arnolds best movie, it won't be forgotten easily. It is suspensful and will keep you guessing, will the terminator get her? The beginning is quite amazing, I mean it isn't mind blowing graphics for our time. If you look closely I think you might be able to see the strings. But the effects aren't what count. It is how the plot and film is portrayed. James Cameron did a superb job in filming this. The DVD features are actually quite interesting, you might keep yourself busy for a few hours watching them. I suggest watching this one before any of the sequels. Personally I think the sequels are a waste of time. The third one is better than the second one because it actually shows judgement day. The second one is alright because it has Linda Hamilton. We all will agree that Linda Hamilton is the real meat behind the series along thi Arnold Schwarzenegger. I strongly suggest that if you have seen this movie, or have good things about it then purchase it. It's worth the money.

Firstly, the metal case scratch the cover of the DVD casing. One pull, and its a goner. Worst yet, I can't out it back in. Secondly, I can enjoy both versions of the movie itself. But the 2nd disc was a BIG DISSAPOINTMENT to me. A few minutes of documentary and no trailers?!? Why even bother call it EXTREME DVD? I mean, the metal casing with the T-800 face on it was cool, but the content was nothing.
I like the movie a lot... but the extras were way too little and how I wish I can get the Ultimate Edition instead.

2135832,4,B0002WYTWG,"From a geek's perspective, T2 extreme is somewhat groundbreaking - groundbreaking in the extra format on disc #2.  Granted, the format is something only an extremist might be interested in, but it was worth the $15 walmart was charging.  The format on disc #2 is 1080/24p (not 1080i).  Also, the sound streams are in 24/96k format - also well beyond the call of duty.  There is a downside to such a format - it needs a special, software-based, playback app.
Disc #2, with the special encoding, is probably the only reason to buy this version of T2, and only buy it if you have a serious machine which can play back such an extreme encoding smoothly.
I gave it 4 stars because many people probably (a) won't have a decent enough monitor to appreciate the new format in, and/or probably (b) won't have fast enough hw to play it back smoothly with.

The movie itself is so awesome that lackluster features probably wouldn't be too much of a drawback (unless this weren't the first version of the movie you were buying on DVD), but the features are outstanding. Cameron and Wisher's commentary is actually entertaining, and the text commentary is so exhaustive that it's almost hard to keep up with (and I didn't really notice any overlap between the two commentaries). And the best feature is the option allowing you to watch the movie in its theatrical form, leaving out the new footage.

2135837,5,B0002WYTWG,"In one of the greatest sci-fi action movies of all time, this amazing film was a breakthrough in cinematic history. Brilliant small-time director James Cameron became a hot property with his highly original screenplay and masterful directing in ""The Terminator."" It also brought a somewhat known, former bodybuilder champion Arnold Schwarzenegger into the ultimate action hero and brought him A-list status. This film is pure genius!
In the year 2029, the world is rural wasteland. The machines, ruled by super-computer Skynet, has taken over. The human resistance, led by the brave John Connor, rallies the rest of civilization to go up against the machines. They win after a hard fought war. To change the past, Skynet sends an ""indestructible"" cyborg, the Terminator(Schwarzenegger) back through time to Los Angeles 1984 to assassinate Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton), John's mother, to prevent her unborn son from saving mankind. The resistance intercepts by sending one of their own, soldier Kyle Reese, back through time to protect Sarah from the unstoppable Terminator, who feels no pity, remorse, or fear.
I love Arnold. His ""I'll be back"" line is the greatest, or one of, movie line in history. His best role ever doesn't have that many lines, but his demeanor, fiercing look and powerful screen presence makes him the perfect choice for the Terminator. Michael Biehn(Kyle) and Hamilton also give great performances whose characters onscreen can't help but love each other and fear the cybernatic organism after them. Director Cameron, who would go on on to make ""Titanic"" and ""T2"", balances great innovative special effects(a bit primitive nowadays) and fine action sequences.
The DVD ain't too shabby either. It has a good picture and new digital sound transfer, documentaries, deleted scenes, trailers and storyboards!",1074556800,,1827,5.369337979094077
2135838,4,B0002WYTWG,"Although it hasn't stopped me from watching the movie about 15 times since its release, I must say that T2 doesn't hold up to scrutiny quite as well as its predecessor or its successor in the Terminator trilogy.  This movie cost about $100 million to make, which is a huge sum today and was even bigger back in 1991.  And while that hefty budget did provide the movie with special effects that were vastly superior to those of the original (no claymation mock-ups of Arnold's face this time out), it detracted from many of the qualities that had made the original Terminator such an intelligent and frightening film.  With so much money to spend on such stunning visuals (and make no mistake, this movie *was* a visual stunner of the highest order), James Cameron and Co. no longer had to focus as much on tiny aspects like atmosphere, characterization, or realism, and in the long run the product suffers as a result.
Perhaps the worst part of the movie is the presence this time around of John Connor himself.  If this kid is going to be the savior of mankind, I question whether mankind is even worth saving.  He starts the movie as a grating, whiny-voiced twerp, and he pretty much stays there until the end.  And what's even worse, he takes Arnold down with him, turning a mighty Terminator into a sensitive, new-agey guy right before our very eyes.  I more or less have to avert my eyes during the last five minutes or so, and I'm sure I'm not alone.
Ok, enough from the complaint department, now for the good stuff.  I've said a lot already about the special effects, and this movie's hypertrophic budget did enable Cameron to pull off scenes he could scarcely have dreamed of back in 1984.  T2 is highlighted by a succession of stunning set pieces that almost single-handedly revolutionized the action genre.  The chase scenes and shootouts are among the most spectacular ever put to film, and there are even a few old-fashioned beatdowns thrown in for good measure.  Not to mention, this movie sees the completion of Sarah Connor's transformation from hapless would-be victim to bona fide tough chick, complete with plenty of muscle tone and a new-found expertise with martial arts and automatic weapons.  I, for one, think change was for the better in this case.
Since T2 was of course a sequel, it was only natural to up the ante in the villain department, and this movie came through in a big way.  The original Terminator was a scary enough killing machine, and in T2 we get not only the return of Arnold, but an even more frightening ""bad"" Terminator in the form of the T-1000.  Made of an ultra-futuristic liquid metal (try not to think whether such a thing is scientifically feasible), the T-1000 slices and dices its way through unsuspecting humans with such efficiency it makes Arnold's old-school T-800 seem like a cuisinart.  And while Robert Patrick is nowhere near as imposing as Arnold, nor as easy on the eyes as T3 villainess Kristanna Loken (well, duh), he did manage to perfect the steely glare that the role required.
In the end, T2 is a much more than satisfactory viewing experience.  It doesn't have the malevolent mood of the original, and it's not quite as intelligent as the latest (last?) installment, but for grandiose action it hardly gets better than this.  The movie also further develops the trilogy's emphasis on fate and free will, with more intimations of the future horrors that await mankind if we continue on our present course.  The intimations of impending apocalypse are kept largely off-screen, but despite (or perhaps because of) that fact, it may be most frightening of all.",1074470400,,3626,4.746815286624204

Some of you may remember when we all feared the Ruskies would nuke us any day -- this film capitalized on that fear and introduced us all to a new terror -- the evils of machines rising up against mankind.  Plot revolves around deadly battle/chase to stop a cyborg sent back thru time.  Many other reviewers will relate every detail, but I suggest you watch the movie.  Keep in mind this was the one that started it, before the matrix and all the others.  Film has a dark tone that is compelling.  Lots of action, weapons, and some Sci-Fi but not too much.  Man vs his creation in a sci-fi tech nightmare.  That theme has since been redone several times since in many ways.  The Terminator set the bar for Tech Noir films, and is the best of the series of three (T2 Judgement Day and T3 Rise of the Machines).  Ironic that after all the Hollywood destruction now the Terminator ""runs"" California. . . Rise of the Machine?  This movie is the role that defined Schwarzenagger's career more than any other.  See the DVD and you'll know what I mean.
The Special Edition Terminator DVD is worth the price!  Quality of sound and video is excellent, bearing in mind that it is almost 20 years old now.  Effects are awesome for the 80's.  But Cameron's original Terminator was made without a major budget, and before Arnold was a big star.  Still they pulled it off nicely!  Not as much as later version, but the Extras (artwork, trailers, deleted scenes, & a sort of screenplay) on this DVD are worthy of the $15 price.  I just watched it again, go get yours.  This version (special ed) is worthy of a place in your collection too, although a boxed set may be coming out with all three sometime.",1073001600,,1793,4.4447852760736195

It has a very good 25 minute long documentary about the use of computer generated special effects and how t2 started the large use of these special effects.  That's basically the only worthwhile special feature that it has.  The special features were really disappointing, but I'm fairly sure that the picture is much better (more colorful and richer) compared to the ultimate edition's picture, which makes the movie that much more enjoyable to watch.  The movie is great, but the special features are lacking...... as for the ultimate edition.....the special features are abundant and the picture isn't too great therefore making the movie a teeny bit less great.

2135855,5,B0002WYTWG,"I said a couple weeks ago on this site that I considered ""Terminator 3"" arguably the best of the series, but having just watched this one again after buying it on DVD I have to rethink my position.  In the few years since I last watched this movie, I had forgotten how dark and disconcerting it managed to be without any uber-expensive special effects.  Since it didn't have anywhere near the budget of its sequels, the original ""Terminator"" had to rely on some old-fashioned devices like detail, atmosphere, and characterization.  The second and third installments were certainly solid efforts, but they seem almost sterile in comparison.  This is easily the rawest ""Terminator"" movie, and all the better for it.
While the screenplay is a model of tightness and efficiency, it's James Cameron's grim vision and stark direction that steal the show.  Nuclear-age paranoia has been a staple of filmmaking at least since ""Dr. Strangelove,"" but the image of the future depicted here is even more unflinching than most.  The L.A. of the 1980's is made to look pretty dark and desolate, but the post-apocalyptic dystopia of 2029 is much worse.  It's a cold, mechanized world, with laser-firing machines roaming around and human skulls littering the landscape in a very nice touch.  And in 1984, man and machine do battle with nothing less than the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.
""The Terminator"" is probably most notable for introducing a new entry into the pantheon of legendary movie supervillains with the role that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger into mega-star status.  As the fearless, guiltless, pitiless twenty-first century killing machine known simply as the Terminator, Schwarzenegger cuts a largely silent swath of destruction through 1984 Los Angeles, killing almost everyone unlucky enough to get in his way.  With the square-jawed Schwarzenegger striking a very imposing figure, the Terminator has become an enduring film villain precisely because it's so mechanical and unfeeling.  In one especially chilling scene, a heavily armed Arnold nonchanlantly strolls through a police station, wordlessly shooting up defenseless cops who have no idea what they're up against.  I can't help thinking that the Terminator would've made a great Nazi.  And when its skin gets burned off and it's reduced to a metal skeleton with fiery red eyes and an evil grin, the Terminator is even scarier.
The movie's human characters don't fare too badly either.  If there's one area in which ""The Terminator"" clearly outdoes its successors, it's emotional depth.  Arnold may be the picture of cool detachment, but the unfairly neglected Michael Biehn (who managed to carve out a decent career himself) turns the future soldier Reese into a tortured soul worthy of Shakespeare.  Everything this guy says and does is intense, fuelled by the horrors that he's experienced and that he knows are coming.  And over the course of the movie Linda Hamilton turns the hapless Sarah Connor into a genuine tough chick, a role that would be taken to its logical conclusion in ""Terminator 2.""
Since this movie the ""Terminator"" franchise has taken on a life of its own, with Arnold playing no less than three different cyborgs in increasingly expensive epics.  The original still hits the hardest though, precisely because it relies more on writing and direction than the special-effects blockbusters of today (this certainly doesn't just apply to the ""Terminator"" movies either).  Not to mention, this movie introduced the line ""I'll be back"" to the national dialogue, for which we should all be eternally grateful.  In this writer's humble opinion, the ""Terminator"" series decks it out with ""Lord Of The Rings"" for the title of THE movie trilogy.",1072569600,,3730,5.154228855721393
2135856,5,B0002WYTWG,"Two sequels later, there still isn't a _Terminator_ movie that comes within miles of the first of the series.
Oh, I like T2 well enough on its own terms, but even though it's got much higher production values than this one, it pretty much wrecks the premise on which the series is based. If the future is really changed, there's nowhere for the Terminators (and Kyle Reese) to come back _from_, and the whole house caves in. (T3 makes a valiant effort to overcome this problem but doesn't quite make it.)
This first one is complete as it stands. Shot on such a low budget that James Cameron couldn't even afford to record it in stereo (a shortcoming finally remedied in the 2001 DVD release), this film sets the standard of logical consistency for time-travel action-thrillers (admittedly a pretty narrow genre; the other reasonably well-known one is _Timecop_, and it's far from consistent).
See, the plot in this one is carefully constructed so that when Skynet sends the Terminator back in time, it's actually helping to _bring about_ the past in which John Connor is conceived: by sending Arnold, Skynet seals its own fate. If you're an SF reader, you'll be thinking of Heinlein's 'By His Bootstraps' at this point, and you'll be right.
There's lots of cool action, too, and even the low-budget special effects have held up well against the last twenty years of cinematography. But the film doesn't actually rely on them all that much; it's really Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and the terrifying Arnold, under James Cameron's direction, that keep the tension high here.
I saw this movie in 1984, almost by accident. I was living on Long Island as a graduate student (math) and my housemate and I headed out one Saturday night to see a movie. By the time we got to the theater, it was already ten p.m. and this was the only one that hadn't already started. I expected to be disappointed, and instead was very pleasantly surprised.
It's still one of my favorites, and it's still every bit as watchable as it was twenty years ago. It's a pre- and post-apocalytpic thriller, a man-vs.-machine action flick, and several other things. But mostly, it's just a great movie.",1072483200,,2171,4.776595744680851

T2 More than Meets The Eye gives a lot of interesting background information as well as showing scenes which did not make the original film.  Granted you have probably seen most of these scenes on TV by now but the accompanying commentary explains what James Cameron was trying to get across and why he ultimately left them out. There are also interviews with the actors in this section.
The Making of T2-3D Breaking the Screen Barrier is interesting but is obviously a made for TV piece put out before the Ride was launched at Universal Studios.  It still has the voiceover throwing to two commercial breaks which I wouldn't imagine would have been too hard to cut out.  Apart from that it is pretty interesting but if you haven't actually been to Universal Studios and seen the completed thing I do not think you will get as much out of it.
The menu you locate everything on this DVD from is really good, a bit hard to get used to how to get back to the main menus in some sections but once you work it out it is a breeze.  Here you can see stuff like all the merchandise available at the time, the 3 different theatrical trailers which are excellent as well as the trailer for this DVD.  You can see all of James Cameron's 700 original sketches he drew as storyboards as well as stuff from special effects to every different job needed to create the thing.  If you are into making movies then you'll be entertained for days.
Oh and yes, the movie is great too.  You'll be back to watch it over and over again. You will also find summaries of the four main actor's careers as well as James Cameron and Brad Fiedel (guy who did the music) on the first disc which are pretty interesting.

Watch the scenes which were cut from the film such as the Terminator walking to his car after blowing away the second Sarah Connor with kids and everyone else running away, lots of scenes between the two main cops (learn that one of these actors was originally supposed to be the Terminator before Arnie claimed it in the Other Voices feature section), Reese breaking down in a field as he tells Sarah how he has never seen plants and stuff plus much, much more.
Other Voices is interviews with the actors and key staff, where they reflect on moments in the film and on being cast.  Michael Biehn was originally almost rejected for Reese because they thought he had a southern accent, is just one of the interesting facts you'll come across.  All companies but Orion rejected the movie idea as well as other background facts make this entertaining and educational viewing.
Terminator a Retrospective is mostly filmed in 1985 with a young Arnie and James Cameron discussing the film with a few inclusions of a 1991 interview mentioning the sequel.

2135869,5,B0002WYTWG,"Sequels are a large and largely ironic part of director James Cameron's film career.  There are those of us who remember one of his earliest films, ""Piranha Part Two: The Spawning,"" which was a sequel of sorts (same type of fish, but not the same fish), and he made two of the most successful sequels of all time in ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day.""  I was going to say that the irony extends to the fact Carmeron directed the most successful film of all time in ""Titanic,"" for which a sequel cannot be made, except ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" is out there in Omni-Max Theaters across the land and tends to subtract from the point.
Unlike Francis Ford Coppola who still had half of the origianl novel to work with, or George Lucas who was working on a trilogy (or Peter Jackson who is doing both), Cameron was faced with trying to build upon a pair of fairly success first features.  After transforming the ""haunted house"" movie ""Alien"" into a military movie with ""Aliens,"" Cameron starts with an equally significant change in the premise for ""Terminator 2,"" turning the T-101 from the villain into the hero.  When you are dealing with a machine it is just a question of reprogramming it accordingly.  Consequently, Cameron is basically able to repeat the entire opening of the original movie (two naked guys come from the future, one is good and one is bad) and then pivot the entire film on the basis of that one little change.
Now, you do not want to think about time paradoxes too closely because they tend to fly apart once logic or the laws of physics are invoked, but since the original T-800 failed to kill Sarah Connor the machines of the future and their overlord Skynet, send back a T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to kill John Connor (Edward Furlong).  Sending back a dozen Terminators of pretty much any model number would probably work better, but the idea here is qualitative improvements rather than quantitative (i.e., this is not ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with its infinite versions of Mr. Smith).  John is saved by another T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and proceeds to rescue his mother (a buffed up Linda Hamilton) from the crazy house, with the T-1000 in close pursuit.
The final significant difference between this film and the original is that Cameron and his co-writer William Wisher have Sarah Connor taking the offensive.  While the T-1000 is hunting mother and son, she is going to do her own manipulation of the time line by taking out Dr. Miles Bennett Dyson (Joe Morton), the scientist whose creative fingerprints end up being all over Skynet's creation.  Dyson is helped by having a couple of significant bits and pieces from the T-800 of the original film (which is where we get right into a ""Planet of the Apes"" time loop, so let's just not go there).  For me, Dyson is the most interesting character in the story, and a clear break from science fiction film stereotypes in a whole lot of ways.
It is easy to get taken away with the special effects in ""Terminator 2"" because of the quantum leap that films took from the water tentacle in Cameron's ""The Abyss"" to the liquid metal of the T-1000, but the human dimension of the dysfunctional Connor family dealing with their particular fate in terms of future events.  The Terminator is now the father figure for John Connor, but the boy has a few lessons of his own to impart to his personal Terminator.  Of course, the ""Judgment Day"" sub-title is something of a misnomer give not only what happens in this film but in the 2003 finale to the trilogy, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" but this 1991 film (and all its myriad variations available on DVD) is a textbook example of how you can intelligently go about putting together a sequel in this genre that will make a lot of money and not insult fans of the original.",1068854400,,3796,4.649253731343284
2135870,3,B0002WYTWG,"It's is hard to imagine that someone has NOT seen this movie, so I won't write much about the movie itself, but the purpose of this Special Edition DVD. I don't know much about the technology behind digital remastering of the audio, but it just seemed to me that the sound effects of the movie were just recorded over the original sound. Anyone who's seen this film over a dozen times or less would immediately notice gunshots, crash scenes, and voices (screams) were replaced. They did a pretty good job with the new sound effects, but there are a few glitches where the main characters' voices got muffled a bit (because they get mixed in with the new sound effects) and the sound of bullet impacts did not match what was seen on screen. As we all know, movie audio is just as important as the video, but the worst part is, the sound effects weren't even that great...just the average KABOOM's and POW's of any regular film...I mean there is no improvement, just replacement.
Being a die hard fan of The Terminator, it just bothered me a little that some sound effects were changed. It just didn't sit right for me or give me that same feeling it did almost 20 years ago. Luckily, it had the original Mono audio option that put the old sound effects in, so I was able to experience the original movie as it should be. Unfortunately, it didn't work through the 5.1 surround sound, of course.
The ""Terminated Scenes"" really got my hyped. I don't know if they presented these scenes in any other version of Terminator, but I could not believe they left such crucial scenes out of the original movie! Well, I won't spoil it, but there are a few scenes that would have made Terminator 2 a complete, accurate sequel to this movie. And it would have REALLY made the movie have a complete ironic twist.
My overall opinion is: If sound does not matter much, one must get this DVD for it awesome 5.1 feature. The deleted scenes included are great, if one has never seen them before.",1068854400,,1974,4.5013927576601676
2135871,5,B0002WYTWG,"Looking back almost twenty years to James Cameron's 1984 film, ""The Terminator"" almost seems quaint.  Given the special effects that would dominated not only its two sequels but just about every other big budget action film to come down the pike, there is an almost brutal simplicity to the original offering.  Lacking the computer generated effectives, more expensive production values, and the self-reflexivity of the two sequels, ""The Terminator"" simply strikes me as being the best of the bunch.  There was a lot of creativity and thought put into ""Terminator II,"" but this one has the better story.
If you think back to 1984 then what we have in this movie is a combination of key elements from ""Jaws"" and ""Halloween.""  From the former we get the idea of a relentless killing machine that stops at nothing, while from the latter comes the fact that somebody who knows you is out to get you for reasons that you do not know and none of the tradition tools of persuasion, such as knives and automatic weaponry have any effect; like Michael Meyers this guy keeps getting back up.  ""The Terminator"" now acknowledges the work of Harlan Ellison, whose teleplays of ""Solider"" and ""Demon With a Glass Hand"" on ""Outer Limits"" are clearly antecedents for this tale, but in many ways Cameron's movie is a high-tech slasher film.  Keep in mind that his previous directorial effort was ""Piranha Part Two: The Spawning,"" and from this film he moved on to ""Aliens.""  It was not really until ""The Abyss"" that Cameron's films started evidencing a sense of the truly poetic (then again, there is the Polaroid photograph in this one).
The premise is simple and direct.  Two naked guys show up in Southern California.  One of them tears a page out of the phone booth and starts killing women named Sarah Connor.  However, there is one more name and address on that list and she is the true target of what is happening.  By now both of the naked men are dressed and the other one saves her from the killing machine, at which point she finds out it really is a killing machine.  Not only that, it has been sent back from the future for the sole purpose of making sure she ends up dead.  Furthermore, it turns out the stakes are a whole lot higher than that as well.
Much is made about the title character being played by the (almost) current governor of California, and while this was certainly a breakthrough performance for Arnold Schwarzenegger (at least for those who never saw ""Pumping Iron""), the story is still the more important element.  Cameron knows how to have exposition double up for explanation, especially when yelled by a character during a car chase, and that most of his audience are not hard-core hard-science science-fiction fans who enjoy a good time travel paradox narrative, whatever the problems in logic and physics.
As Cameron would prove again in ""Aliens,"" he knows how to push down on the pedal and pour on things at the end to give us the thrill of several ""what next?"" moments.  Also, he maintains the Dionysian sense of gloom until the end of the film.  In fact, that is true of the entire trilogy, which has ended the series without every providing a moment when the lead character and the rest of us can believe that things are going to be okay.",1068768000,,3262,4.666666666666667
2135872,5,B0002WYTWG,"Who said sequels aren't any good? ""Terminator 2"" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.
If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, gee Molly, is it wonderful.
Yeah, he's ""back."" Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)
Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)
Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.
Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and ""Xtreme"" edition DVDs, Sarah says, ""You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!"" It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), ""T2"" clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.
I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is ""T2: Judgment Day"" better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.
If you're looking for an action film, ""T2"" is your safest bet. It's ten times better than the other junk out there, and it has a definite, not-stop, pulse-pounding sense of action, that leaves you trying to catch your breath. It has a strong narrative and a clear statement on our society. On the other hand, ""The Terminator"" is probably the film for horror fans, time travel film fans, or those who like to be thrilled while they're watching their films regarding the future.
In some respects, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.",1068422400,,5808,4.71751968503937

2135874,4,B0002WYTWG,"While lacking the superior effects and epic preachy scope of its successors, the original film serves as a taut and gritty introduction to the Terminator mythos of James Cameron.  Sent back in time by the machine world god to eliminate the mother of the leader of the human resistance, played by the creased and unattractively mannish Linda Hamilton, Arnold is the Terminator T-101, a killing machine wrapped in human flesh.  To stop him, the human resistance of the future sends a lone soldier back to ostensibly save Hamilton but also to fulfill is uh other duties.  Shot mostly at night, there is never much of a let down in the action as the Terminator stalks and shoots at the two protagonists.  The stop motion animation of the T-101, and the miniatures of the opening and dream sequences, well before the advent of affordable CG, doesn't hold up too well these days.  Also in the post-Conan era, Arnold brings a blank relentlessness to the Terminator that would do Michael Meyers proud.  Unlike the two sequels, the film is widely humorless, except for, amusingly enough, Lance Henriksen as the cynical cop.  While rightfully a genre stand-out, it does appear a bit dated.  The 2 sided DVD offers some rather old documentaries on the making of T1 w/ Cameron and Arnold vying for conversation control.  There's also the original treatment, and Cameron's artwork.  Not bad and still recommended.",1068249600,,1400,4.919148936170213

About the Extreme version though, I am passing this one by. If you can still get it, pick up the older Ultimate Edition instead.
If you look hard enough there are 3 versions of the film as opposed to only the 2 in the Extreme version. As far as the windows media support in the Extreme, how good can it be? Who really cares for it if you have Dolby digital, and DTS support anyway.

Commentary:  WHOA!  Holier-than-thou Cameron actually recorded a scene by scene talkfest with co-writer William Wisher.

That aside, it's a good listen that provides nice insight, to T1 as well which had this feature sorely missing.
Deleted Scenes:  Cameron is even watching his original near three hour cut, with some interesting moments that had to be sheared.

2135879,5,B0002WYTWG,"The first ""Terminator"" movie from 1984 became, from my point of view, one of the most unlikely sci-fi/ action hybrid classics of all-time. With such a low budget that was allotted into making that movie, the result was a surprisingly incredible experience thanks to James Cameron putting that limited amount of money into excellent use. Parts of that movie though, especially the futuristic scenes have dated rather badly over the years but it still remains a highly innovative movie. 1991's follow-up ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" takes what was great about the first one and builds upon it to create an even better sequel. This is no sequel slump by any stretch of the imagination. James Cameron with the benefits of a much higher budget and with the task of creating one of the most highly anticipated sequels ever in the history of movie-making, he pushes the envelopes of sci-fi action thriller making and revolutionized special effects by creating some of the most awesome special effects ever made in action movies even by todays standards. ""Judgement Day"" surpasses the first one by a good amount in many ways, even though the first one was awesome in it's own right. It showed a much improved technological breakthrough in movie-making with far more special effects and innovation that results in a movie that still looks fresh and as up to date and even ahead of it's time, much more so than many sci-fi movies that have come ever since then.
It all begins many years after the terrifying events of the year 1984 where Sarah Connor survived her ordeal with the emotionless human cyborg. She is now in a mental hospital after being arrested for attempting to blow up a computer factory. John Connor is a very rebellious teenager who's in the care of foster parents. However, John Connor, even if he 'survived' the ordeals of the original Terminator machine, his life is about to take a drastic change when two Terminator machines arrive out of the unknown realm, in the year 1992 in Los Angeles for opposite purposes. One is to kill John Connor, the other to protect him from the vicious machine.  Skynet from the year 2029 send an extremely dangerous human cyborg called the T-1000 who can take the shape of any human being by means of liquid mercury metal, to kill John Connor to prevent him from being able to lead the human resistance against the machines. Just as the machines sent back a T-1000 back in time, the humans also send back another cyborg ironically called ""The Terminator"", with almost exactly the same design as the original version that was sent back to kill Sarah Connor many years back.
While it may have improved upon the greatness of the 1984 original Terminator movie, ""Judgement Day"" carries all of the depth and darkness of that one and takes the storyline to even darker realms. For a relatively long movie of over 2 and a half hours, the darkness and the incredible suspense will keep you holding tight to your seats for the entire time. Few movies in my opinion have such ability to do this but Terminator 2 does just that. In some ways, I would also view this second outing as the opposite or counterpart to the original Terminator movie. The first one had Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the bad guy while this one has him playing the good guy. I kind have to say that Arnold did a better job at playing the evil Terminator machine from the first one but he still does such an excellent job playing the 'good' guy while Robert Patrick delivers a truly chilling role as the menacing liquid metal machine T-1000.  While Arnold Scwarzenegger did some good movies since then, his roles went downhill in my opinion, and fell to rock bottom with the awful ""Batman & Robin"" movie and hit speed bump after speed bump before getting back on top with the awesome ""Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines"". To me, it's the Terminator movies that have forever made me a fan of many of his movies. Edward Furlong does such an excellent job playing the rebellious John Connor, must I saw even better than Nick Stahl did in the Terminator 3 movie, no offense to Stahl, he did good but Furlong did better. Linda Hamilton improves her character Sarah Connor, by turning her in a mean woman fighter, with massive attitude. In some ways, Sarah Connor rivals Ripley from ""Aliens"" as the best woman fighter character in any movie I've ever seen. With the help of the extraordinary directing of James Cameron, dark and powerful script, and from the excellent cast, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" was one of the few movies that got all of the justice that it deserves. This is one of the best movies of 1991 and even now, it still has all of the punch it had when it was released. No other action movie, except for ""T3"" has toyed with darkness, fun, action, and depth the way that ""Judgement Day"" did.
I don't know how they did it but they created what I would consider one of the best movie sequels ever in the history of movies. A good number of sequels fall flat on their faces against their original counterparts but not ""T2: Judgement Day"". This one surpasses the first one. Go and get this movie. I don't really feel like commenting on the presumably numerous editions released these past couple of years. I just would like to say that you should get this movie. I just wanted to comment on the movie itself. I went through the sad event of having to toss out the VHS edition because it got damaged from being worn out. This is definitely one of the best movies ever made and I must even go the distance to say that this movie trilogy is up there with Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, and Indiana Jones as my favorite movie trilogy.

2135881,5,B0002WYTWG,"After a stream of hits that peppered the '80s, Writer/Director James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger reunited after almost seven years to work on the long-awaited sequel to the ground-breaking ""Terminator.""  They did that and far more.  ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" succeeds not only in terms of white-knuckle action sequences, but it also deeped the mythology of the Terminator Saga to greater depths than almost anyone thought possible.  Arnold returns to his best role by far as the Terminator, a cyborg in this film sent to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) as a teen from a superior liquid-metal morphing machine (Robert Patrick) sent by Skynet in the future to kill Connor.  Also added to the rag-tag team of Connor and the Terminator is his Connors' mother Sarah (a terrific Linda Hamilton) buffed-up and ready for the impending holocaust.
The film kicks off with the one of the most breath-taking opening sequences ever.  Set in the future, the machine armies and the human armies advance on one another in  lazer-filled combat.  Even though the scene is far grander than the low profile hit and run missions of the original, it still maintains the intimacy that made those secrets all the more engaging.  From there, the film transplants itself to 1992 Los Angeles, where Sarah Connor is locked up in a mental hospital and John Connor is held up with foster parents.  Out of nowhere, two terminators from the future show up, both with different intentions about what to do John.  After giving the seemingly unstoppable T-1000 the slip, the T-101 and John go after his mother and later mount a daring, and damn near sucidal attempt to alter the nighmarish events of the future by trying to derail the progress of the computer company Cyberdyne.
What also makes ""Judgement Day"" such a great movie is the well-formed relationships between John Connor, his mother and the T-101.  John rocky relationship with her mother is played out as is the growing attachment they both feel towards the particular machine that is protecting them.  The relationships germinate throughout the film, growing and blossoming as the plot thickens and boils over in a tense and spectacular in the Cyberdyne building and a metal refinery.  So much credit is due to writers William Wisher and of course James Cameron.  Cameron also provides quick, fluid and often intense pacing over the films' near 150 minute running time without letting down on the story or mythos, which is what makes the Terminator Saga so enduring to begin with.",1064880000,,2524,4.992840095465394
2135882,2,B0002WYTWG,"The only reason i bought the Extreme Version was for the option of spanish subtitles, even so the all new audio commentary of James Cameron is fantastic, the video and audio quality is slitty better that previous releases, the interactive mode gives you inside to a lot of info in text displayed with the movie, along with video segments and audio clips with still pictures every time the cyberdyne logo appears on screen, and you do have the option of selecting with ease viewing the special edition or theatrical version of the film...but that's all!!!
Disc 2 of this EXTREME version, to put in one simple word...is Junk!!! Only 2 documentaries, no trailers, no photo galleries, no storyboards, etc....what do you get instead? dvd-rom features which aren't appealing to the average viewer and the theatrical version of the film for windows media player...come on!!! who was the idiot who thought about this stupit idea, really what a waste of disc space!!!
The average dvd consumer wants to view their movies on their tv with a home theater system, not on a pc, and to enjoy of documentaries, trailers, video segments, deleted scenes, etc...that's worth buying for!!!

2135886,4,B0002WYTWG,"I'm sure most reviewers have given some background information about the storyline of Terminator Spec. Ed but I will focus on the audio. I'm sure the fans of T1 are perhaps more into the original movie and like this film best of the 3 T's. This is where I want to give you notice: The audio is in a newly- mastered digital 5.1 stereo with the option for the original mono. I deducted a star for 1) how the digital stereo was enhanced and 2) the quality of the original mono.
I was expecting that the new digital stereo would be a careful tweak of the original audio. And that is negative. The original mono has a cool sound of what seems like swords interacting with each other at the opening title. You hear it about 2- 3 times in mono, but for whatever ""earthly"" reason, the sound effect was deleted from the digital sound. Also, the experts placed the sound of a helicopter as the scene changed to where the stray dog walks through the streets and the camera moves into the alley for the scene with the homeless man, whose words were somewhat lost by the helicopter noise. There were absolutely no helicopter sounds at all in the original audio.
I shook my head that the experts wanted to place additional sound fx into this classic. That's one reason I had to deduct from this DVD, whose video is cleaned up and has a more dramatic feel. The black level was darkened... My original experience with the Terminator video from a while ago was that the overall picture seemed muddy, which resulted in a lack of saturation, but this picture quality was much better, and had more contrast, which is needed for adding to the effect of dread.
If you've never seen the movie before, I'm sure you'll appreciate the newly- enhanced and updated stereo. If you're a TRUE Terminator fanatic, you'll be slightly dismayed of the new insertions of audio that the producers felt we needed to have to help us enjoy a movie that really doesn't need much more since it was near- perfect already.
As for the mono audio, I'm glad they kept this option with the movie. However, the audio could have been tweaked a bit better, because it seemed rather flat. The highs just weren't crisp enough. With a good mono track, it can almost mimic stereo, but the treble just puttered.
So, 3 stars would be too harsh, and 5 aren't deserved because of the audio issues, to me.",1063238400,,2345,4.494145199063232

2135895,3,B0002WYTWG,"Although with it's good intentions in the beginning, and special effects/ technoligical aspects, it could have been a milestone.
But, sadly, I don't agree it is.
He's back, here to protect young John Connor from the T-1000 (the truly best thing of ANYTHING of this film).
Robert Patrick can pull this act off so well, that nobody, not even our best oscar winners out there could do as well, besides he looks the part, physically, and with his ice cold stares that are stealth, he was the best choice. A great actor too-not just here, but every movie I've seen him in.
Arnold-uh...Ah-nold is really a pretty good actor....but what is a terminator/robot doing with an Austrian/Belgian accent? Please. Regular speech from your typical robot: 'Attack' or 'This does not help our mission'
Arnold's Belgian T-101 : 'Uh-tack' or 'This doz not help our meeshion'
See? Regardless, yes, his acting and character is great.
Edward Furlong has most of his character down pat, yet he slips now and then, like the 'cool dude' jokes, which , well, the way he put them, weren't funny, and was annoying with the 'rad, dude' stuff. His dialouge that was given to him wasn't the best either. Like, 'We've got Skynet by the (you know)'
WHY SO 90's cool? Even though that's the kind of dialouge going around then, it's not the kind of humour that this movie needed. They are trying too hard ! Just be funny or natural. If needed. IT'S LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE a sarcastic 90's style coooool remark. Stupid.
Linda Hamilton is trying too hard with her part. Yes, she's suppose to be angry, scared, and numb to a lot of things. Still, she did allright.
The acting with everybody, except for Robert Patrick, is a bit too tidy or pleasent for a movie that's suppose to be a thriller-sci-fi, so it comes too tight as a movie. The 'nuke ' message is not really preached, more just given as a fact, which is better. Good for Cameron on that part.
Maybe the violence, language, and even the attitude was kept that way so it was easier to understand for teens, who flockled to this movie, since it was 14-AA and not rated 'R' in a lot of places. Not fair to us. And still too violent for teens anyways.
Overall, the movie was not natural enough. Good, not great. And any other things great about the film cannot save it from this factual look at the weak parts.
The worst part is , no offense Arnold, the physique and acting skills are very good on his part.....the accent, if he couldn't skip it, then they should have kept him a mute, which wouldn't work, or get somebody else, for all three of the Terminator flicks.
P.S. - the scene where Arnold smiles while Edward Furlong agrees silently that the weapon he found looked cool on him wasn't very practical....he smiles?
A) he's a robot, and making him smile makes him less of a convincing Terminator.
B) he didn't even know WHAT a smile was or what it is to a human to smile...so why did he? They tried toooo quickly to make him toooo human. He's JUST beginning to learn. The words or lines he says that aren't the norm to him (""Hasta la vista, baby"" or ""He'll live"") are funny, but better that he says it in a robotic way....he's a robot, so keep his disposition that way!",1061856000,,3200,4.490566037735849

I'm in love with this movie cause the actors are awesome(Arnold especially), action scenes 24/7, very good special effects for a 91 movie, and storyline is awesome.  I know people who think matrix is really cool since it's like about us being in a computer,etc.  But I'm not a big fan of that.  But the story of how machines become self-aware in T2 is a really good one.  Even thought that would never happen and the movie is kinda sci-fi with Arnold getting sent back in time and all...I don't pay attention to that...this movie is freakin awesome!!!
  Arnold was the perfect guy for this movie and It's all cause of him this flick is such a huge hit.  The whole cast did an awesome job.  I watched this movie countless times...I'm a huge fan. ...
  My favorite scene in T2 is when when that one lady working in that mental hospital punches Arnold's face and breaks his shades...then he just turns his face back and throws her by just shoving her face.  I crack up at that part every time and I'm doing that now that I'm remembering that scene....
  T1 was kinda dumb cause the special effects were really [weak], Arnold was the bad guy, there wasn't that much action like in T2, and all the music sounded like it was from a Nintendo game...lol.  When I heard T3 was coming out I waited forever for that movie to come out and when I saw it I really liked it, but I didn't like it better than T2 because it didn't have John Connor in it and the new vilan (terminatrix) was kinda shady, but still good.

While you normally watch a sequel with an appreciation of where it came from, in this case, you watch the original with an appreciation of what it led to: the film that many praise as one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history. What these people overlook, though, is the fact that the original wasn't that tough an act to follow in the first place.
Make no mistake about it, Terminator is not a bad movie at all. In fact, it's a lot of fun. A cold, efficient cyborg, played by a young Ah-nuld, is sent back in time to destroy the mother-to-be of the savior of the humans of the future. Said mother-to-be, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) doesn't know what the heck she did to deserve being targeted for termination. And Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is the soldier also sent back in time, to protect Sarah and explain everything to her. (Sarah: ""There must be some mistake, I didn't do anything!""  Reese: ""No, but you will."") Good concept, well-structured script, over-all adequate performances, and most of all, terrific action sequences.
But when you really come down to it, Terminator, hampered as it was by its modest budget (the reason behind its mono soundtrack), a so-so performance from Ms Hamilton (she was still then learning to act), and the limits of the technology of the time (it uses stop-motion animation, a technique that had by this time lost its appeal), is not a great movie, just a pretty good one. More than anything else, it is a mere curiosity, an answer to several trivia questions. Such as:
What film launched Arnold Scharzenegger to superstardom?
What was James Cameron's first major effort after his less-than-auspicious start with Piranha II?
And of course, what was the movie that spawned one of the highest-grossing sequels of all time?",1061510400,,1771,4.787581699346405

2135902,5,B0002WYTWG,"Before Titanic...
Before True Lies....
Before Aliens....there was The Terminator.
James Cameron's first bona fide hit, this 1984 science fiction/action thriller revived the action movie genre and provided Arnold Schwarzenegger with not only an iconic movie role but a chance to prove that he had an actor's mind as well as a bodybuilder's physique.  It not only showed that Ahhnold could handle a more challenging role than Conan the Barbarian, but that he was quite capable of taking career risks.
Now that he is running for the governorship of California (and starred in many other films, including two sequels to The Terminator), it seems odd to think that Schwarzenegger was gambling his credibility (and his box office appeal) to take the role of the villain.  After all, who better than this physically imposing fellow to portray the relentless cyborg sent from the future to rid the world of the woman who is destined to be the mother of humanity's future deliverer?
1984's The Terminator paints a dark vision of a machine-dominated world where hunter-killer robots and Terminators are waging a war of extinction against humanity.  By 2029 A.D., however, the machines are on the verge of defeat at the hands of John Connor and his valiant troops.  In a last ditch attempt to win, the Skynet computers send a single Cyberdine T-101 unit (Schwarzenegger) back to 1984 Los Angeles to dispose of John Connor's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton).
Before the time portal breaks down forever (or at least until T2), Connor manages to send Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) back to 1984 to protect his mother-to-be.  Although he is weakened by the time jump and definitely more vulnerable than his cyborg nemesis, he has an advantage that the Terminator and its masters don't; he knows what Sarah Connor looks like.  This proves to be fatal for at least two other Sarah Connors in the L.A. phone book, as well as for Sarah's roommate and her boyfriend.  The Terminator, only knowing the name Sarah Connors, dispatches these unlucky victims while Reese manages to reach the true target in the nick of time.
The Terminator is well-written and, although its plot is not as mind bending as Schwarzenegger's later hit Total Recall, never insults the audience's intelligence.  The pace of the movie is, like the villain, full of purpose and relentless.  Critics and Ahhnold bashers might scoff at Schwarzenegger's android-like mannerisms, but his very expressionless glare and the way his head swivels to follow his eyes bring the cold efficiency of a shark to mind.  (And if you were wondering, this was the first movie where Ahhnold utters his now famous phrase ""I'll be back."")
 Brad Fiedel's effective musical score, Stan Winston's amazing make-up effects, and Cameron's directing helped make The Terminator a classic of the action/science fiction genre.
The MGM Special Edition DVD presents the movie in a digitally mastered, hi-definition transfer widescreen version with both its original mono sound track and a new 5.1 Stereo Remix.

2135903,5,B0002WYTWG,"There are countless ways to describe how I think of this film; one of them is Spectacular! The first in the classic Terminator movie series is a ground-breaking cinematic work of art of absolutely stunning proportions and put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map and made him one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and early 1990s before several commercial duds would temporarily dampen his success later on (Batman & Robin anyone?) until ""Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines"" came along. The groundbreaking movie is the story of an extremely bleak future where Los Angeles and much of the world's civilization is wiped out by nuclear Armageddon when a computer program/internet named Skynet, goes out of control, and the machines, under control of it, unleash a reign of nuclear terror and destruction, decimating much of the human (non-machine) population, and taking over much of the world, except for a few surviving humans who have gathered forces to fight against the machines thanks to a rebel leader named John Connor who leads what remains of the human race into ultimately smashing the machines into junk, ensuring victory against them. However, the machines send back a human cyborg 45 years back in time to the year 1984, to kill John Connor, by means of ""terminating"" a waitress woman named Sarah Connor, who is the future mother of the human rebel leader, which would result in John never even being born in the first place. In the year 1984, Sarah Connor's life seems like any ordinary life: living as a waitress at a slighltly seedy L.A. Restaurant, and barely balancing a checkbook. She has no idea that it will take a massive turn. A rebel soldier named Kyle Reeves is also sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor, and her 'unborn' son from the emotionless Terminator and thus fighting for the future of humanity. At that point, it is evident that Reeves would not only protect John Connor but in fact, turn out being his father later on. What makes The Terminator even more dangerous is that he is able to copy other peoples voices, and yes, even copy women's voices, making him even more likely to find where his target is. The human cyborg does not feel emotion; it does not feel pain; it cannot be reckoned with. He can blend in with the rest of society as he is part human, part machine, with flesh on the outside, but machine and robot on the inside and all these things make him so much more dangerous to be reckoned with.
Parents, be warned! There are truckloads of disturbing violence in this film and also some extremely bloody scenes that will scare young children and I can't blame them, even I have become unsettled when watching this when I was younger but sadly worse stuff has happened in real life. There is one scene which I'm not going to mention for fear of spoilers, that even I had a relatively tough time handling. Occasional profanity also makes this movie one for the more grown-up audiences. However, it also brings to mind, the possibility of what might happen if man and machine do in fact, start fighting each other especially with all of the computer viruses that plague the internet today. It also brings to mind that it is possible to actually build a machine that could do the same things that Terminator actually does in this movie. In top of it all, it is very chilling as the movie's story does brush very closely with reality at the possibility of all of the things happening in this movie actually occurring in real life especially with all of these computer virus attacks that have crippled businesses these past few years although time travel may not be possible because it would likely have messed up the timeline already.

This film, while it was a highly ground-breaking film back in 1984, has really begun to show it's age, especially the futuristic battle scenes where the floating spacecraft vehicle looks more like a toy suspended on a string than a realistic looking battle vehicle but this movie was made during a time before the special effects technology would skyrocket not too long afterwards, often to an excessive degree. Also it was filmed and The special effects also kind of look cheesy now due to the time of their creation, but only to a mild degree. The two latter Terminator movies benefited from superior production but while parts of the first Terminator movie have really dated badly, there is no denying that this is still a five star plus movie and I highly recommend buying this for those who want a highly brilliant movie, with violence and action that meshes along with the storyline, as opposed to the brainless, thug war violence of a lot of today's movies (""2 Fast 2 Furious"" anyone?). While parts of this movie really show signs of being extremely dated, particularly the futuristic battle scenes in 2029, the low budget spent on making this incredible movie really went into good use thanks in part to a strong story and stunning directing thanks in part to the blossoming talent of James Cameron. ""Terminator"" is arguably one of the best movies from the 1980s and also one of the most fascinating and most innovative sci-fi action movies of all time.
""The Terminator"" is a highly essential film for the ages. From here through the next two movies, we hear that unforgettable line ""I'll Be Back!"". Whether to see cinematic innovation or just simply have fun, or just have some 1980s nostalgia, this movie delivers all of the above and is an essential film and the success of it resulted in two dynamite sequels. It's so unbelievable how James Cameron took the low budget spent on the movie's making and turned what could've been a long forgotten throwaway sci-fi flick into a timeless modern masterpiece. All three of the Terminator movies are masterpieces. Go and buy this today and get the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2: ""Judgement Day"" as well!",1061164800,,5845,4.752952755905512

2135906,4,B0002WYTWG,"I didn't get around to watching this film until after I had already seen Terminators 2 and 3, however it did manage to impress me none-the-less, and I was amazed at how much James Cameron and company managed to do with a bare-bones budget. This film should definately inspire young film makers as to just how much can be done with such a small budget, and for those who were like me and saw all the Terminator films but this one, there's no time better than the present. There are some complaints I have with it, most of wich have to do with the fact that this is an 80's movie. The score, while having some decent themes, sounds very much like the cheap synthesizers you can buy in a department store. There's also the very dated 80's fashion and hairstyles wich will certainly make you chuckle more than once, but hey, the movie's supposed to take place in the 80's, so just think of it as being ""Historically accurate"". There's also some adult oriented material in the movie, but there's nothing that can't be skipped over by a mute button and the fast forward and chapter skip buttons on your DVD remote, if you're offended by that kind of thing. The film is definately something that should be seen by sci-fi fans, casual T2 fans, and young film makers alike. The special features side of thes DVD 18 flipper are definately worth checking out, and there are two deleted scenes that I don't know why they didn't reincorperate into the actual film, because they add so much to the story and really set the stage for Terminator 2. There's also an excellent doccumentary and some other stuff, so yeah, this is a pretty packed set. It definately deserves a spot next to those T2: Ultimate and Extreme edition DVDs you have on your shelf.",1061078400,,1737,4.517460317460317
2135907,5,B0002WYTWG,"*This review is about the ultimate edition of this film, not the ""Extreme Edition"".*
The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect young John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the evil T-1000 (Robert Patrick). Along the way they get John's mom Sarah (Linda Hamilton) out of a mental institute. She is there because nobody believes her story about the approaching ""Judgment Day"". So Sarah plans to prevent Judgment Day from happening, all while the T-1000 is hunting down the three of them.
I own the Ultimate Edition, which I managed to buy last year, and is definitley the best DVD ever. It has 2 versions of the movie (the theatrical version and the Special Edition which has 15 extra minutes of footage) plus an extended Special Edition with 5 more minutes than the Special edition but you need to type in 82997 and enter between numbers to access this. It also has three documantaries, storyboards, commentary, and a whole lot more. Good luck trying to find this. If you do manage to find this then buy this. Otherwise, you'll just have to stick with the recently released extreme edition.",1060992000,,1113,4.832460732984293
2135908,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 is a rise above most of the other action movies that have been filmed in the past two decades.  And it's got more than special effects to brag.
Unlike a lot of other action flicks of the modern age, this film combines special effects, actions, and good drama to the fore front of this movie.  Most action films will depend on its indulgence and concentrational value of their special effects and action sequences to sell tickets and encourage rentals.  Not T2.
Oh it has its action, its special effects which will keep you on the edge of your seat.  But it has even more to offer than just that.  A great storyline.
In the first movie, Arnold was the villain robot out to murder Sarah Connor.  Now he returns as the good robot who is ordered to protect John Connor from an assassin robot.  The assassin robot played by Patrick is T-1000 a highly advanced machine that is made of liquid metal.  Sounds cool huh?  Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor and is kind of on the deep end, on the edge of going berserk, very different than her character in the first film.  But this is great character development and acting.  If you knew that the world was going to end wouldn't you be a bit edgy?  Exacto Mundo.
What I like the best out of this film, is the growth of John and the Terminator together.  The Terminator will pick up certain principles and morals during the film, becoming sort of human because of the influence of John.  I thought this was superb, it gives a dramatic and emotional element to this film.
Without the bonding of the characters around each other, this film would be nothing more but a waste of great action sequences, which a lot of action films seem to do.  You need a human element in a storyline as well as a point to why it's being told.  A point, meaning what makes this story so entertaining, what is this film about?  And T2 has an easy answer to that question.  Which you'll learn later when you see it.
If you haven't seen it, see it.  You'll like it.

2135909,5,B0002WYTWG,While this film may be the most violent of the Terminator trilogy it certainly sets the stage for the continuing story of John Conner and the Terminator. This DVD edition is slightly different from the original theatrical release in that it provides pertinent additional footage.

2135910,2,B0002WYTWG,"This thing is really not very good. The menus are terrible and not very user friendly, and it takes forever to go from one place to another. The ""extras"" are accesible only from a DVD ROM. That's right, they are useless on a standard DVD player. So unless you have a computer with a DVD rom, and enjoy watching DVD extras on a computer screen in an uncomfortable chair instead of the couch, you are SOL. I also found the movie (which of course looks and sounds great, as it should) to be prone to occaisional audio drop outs (My DVD player? Who knows?)
The metal case is cool, even if it does tear up the DVD case and is always dented, but besides that, this thing is nowhere near as good as the Ultimate Edition. It has fewer extras (and virtually none if you don't have a DVD Rom). The commentary track is very uninformative on the techinical aspects of the film, it mostly consists of Cameron cutting off the other guy (the writer I think) and offering pretentious ramblings about his ""vision"". And again, unless you have a DVD ROM or can find the easter eggs in the clumsy menus, you can't watch the theatrical version.

2135911,4,B0002WYTWG,"I hated this movie the first time I saw it.  However, I couldn't get it out of my head, and watched two years later, and got past what made me hate it.
I like the acting.  Schwarzenegger is perfect as a Terminator with minimal personality and lines.  He is menacing and does not justify his actions at all.  He just DOES.  Hamilton is very good in her role, and Biehn is, as always, excellent.
The story is original (for Hollywood).  It's also simple enough to fit in a movie.  A robot coming from the future to kill the mother of the man who successfully led the rebellion against a robot-controlled future is quite good.  It is believable (for those who can accept this type of story), and enough is left to the imagination that it isn't spoiled.  The sequels forgot this technique.
The special effects, of course, are generally poor.  We can tell Schwarzenegger is wearing a rubber mask when he does surgery on his face, and the robot is obviously animation.  However, watching the movie, I didn't care.  The story was good.
The violence is well done.  It is a very violent movie, but the violence is more imagined or suggested.  It is not shown very much.  I appreciate that very much.  The sequels glorified in blood and guts and random destruction.  This one is very focused.
The ending is depressing.  Although, obviously, Hamilton wins in the end and survives, the world is still facing nuclear destruction and near extermination of the human race.  That was why I hated the movie so much.  What I came to realize later is that the world is not a happy place.  We have happy moments, but what really keeps us going is knowing that no matter how dark the world is now or may become, it will get better.
This movie did not need a sequel, and its storyline actually outlaws sequels.  The two sequels are pale imitations.  They have far better special effects, but the stories and the action are totally unbelievable.  I never cared about anybody in the sequels and even started cooking while I watched them (always a bad sign since I hate cooking).
Buy this one.  Forget anyone ever made sequels.",1059696000,,2101,4.568364611260054

2135913,5,B0002WYTWG,"Starring Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Joe Morton, Earl Boen, and introducing Edward Furlong.
In the year of 2029, John Connor has become a rebel. He has tried to protect humans from Skynet, a computer fighting human resistence. Skynet sends a terminator, different from T-800, out to kill a younger John Connor in the 90's. At that same time, John Connor sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect him.
After saving John from T-1000 in the 90's, John and the Terminator go to to free Sarah Connor, John's mother, from a state mental institution. Sarah has been held there for years because of the events of ""The Terminator"". When they free her, they go to see Miles Dyson, the leader of Cyberdyne, the same company as Skynet, who has no idea of what it is becoming. All of them go to Cyberdyne and try to destroy it before T-1000 gets ahold of them.
Filmed with amazing special effects and an interesting storyline, ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" scores a pretty high rating in my book. This feature ends up being better than the original.
The acting was very good in this film. The acting from Arnold Schwarzenagger, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick was all good, as for Edward Furlong, a fair performance. I didn't expect much from him, after all, this was his pre-""American History X"" performance.
The special effects in the film are top-notch. They were very well done and even helped the movie win an Academy Award.
""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is one of my favorite Action movies ever made. The special edition DVD makes it even more fun to watch, with the picture and sound remastered. You won't be disappointed with the ending, the emotion between The Terminator and John cannot be missed. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" which released July 2nd this year, was a good feature, but lacked the heart that ""T2"" had.",1059350400,,1848,4.814465408805032

2135931,5,B0002WYTWG,"Everybody has at least heard of the Terminator. Everybody at least knows the lines ""I'll Be Back"" or ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"". Everybody knows Arnold as the tough metallic T-800. This is the movie that started it all back in 1984, and IMHO, is the best one in the great trilogy.
Los Angeles, 2029: We happen upon what used to be the well-known thriving city in California. Instead, it is a desolate pile of rubble and human skulls, and the machines are taking over. But the few humans left still fight. The human resistance is led by John Connor. So, Skynet (the ultra-powerful computer in charge) sends the T-800 (The Terminator) back in time to 1984 to kill John's mother, Sarah, before John is born, to prevent his birth/existance. But the human resistance sends back a soldier, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah so John will be born and the human resistance can still fight on.
This movie is fun, scary, funny, and it grabs your interest from the very first five minutes and does not let go. It also has many intricate plot twists, so play close attention. As Rich Eisen (ESPN) said in ""I Love The '80s"", it's a fun story. And it is. It really helped to make sci-fi thrillers what it is today.
So in closing, if you're a little sick of the sad excuse for action movies today (most of which featuring Vin Diesel...ugh), you have to get this one. I guarantee you'll love it.",1059004800,,1369,4.502008032128514

Linda Hamilton returns as Sara Connor, and has been preparing her son for the future war to come. Her performance is a great continuation of the character she played in the first movie, and she has been through the ringer for her knowledge of what's to come.  The special effects are ground breaking, and they do hold up well over time, maybe because they were done with a sense class, and not overly done like the movies we have coming out now.

Now, Arnold reprises his role as the Terminator (now a T-850 model), who's become the hero sent back in time to protect the hero himself from a new, liquid-metal Terminator: the T-1000, a robot that is all but invincible.

That aside, this movie has too little action and spends too much time with pointless romantic (and sexual) scenes as well as several boring flashbacks to the future (no pun intended). It never seemed to end. Just when you think the terminator is killed he pops up again. However for the few good action parts it provides, I give ""the Terminator"" 2 stars.

Directed by James Cameron. Written by James Cameron and William Wisher Jr.

This is the sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator-HD/dp/B008S2BZ10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator [HD</a>] (1984).

Returning: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, Earl Boen, William Wisher Jr.

Children are playing on a swing set in the city of Los Angeles. Suddenly, we see the aftermath of nuclear destruction. The voice of Sarah Connor tells us about the nuclear war that happened on August 29, 1997. Three billion human lives were taken. Those that survived this Judgement Day had to face another war, The War of the Machines.
  Sarah Connor did have a son, John Connor. In the future, John is a grown man and the leader during the War of the Machines.  The SkyNet Computer System sent out Terminators to go back to 1984 to try to omit John Connor as they were after Sarah Connor before her son was created and born.
It is now in the future, the year 1995. A surge of electricity and a black hole appears at a diesel truck stop. A naked, muscular man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is transported through. It is the Terminator again. He walks into The Corral truck stop diner and gets looked at for his nakedness. He asks a biker (Robert Winley) for his clothes, boots and a motorcycle. The Terminator gets a cigar burnt into his chest. This starts a fight.  The Terminator gets ""bad to the bone"".
  At the Santa Fe bridge, another naked man (Robert Patrick) is transported. He is a T-100. He kills the police officer (Tom McDonald) and takes his clothes and car.
  Both Terminators are after John Connor (Edward Furlong), who is now 10 years old and living in a foster home.
  Sarah Connor is in a mental hospital for schizophrenia. Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) put her in there. They are forcing her to be medicated. She is making herself stronger because she wants out of there to see and raise her son.

Also in the cast: Danny Cooksey, Jim Palmer,  William Wisher Jr, Joe Morton, S. Epatha Merkerson, Nikki Cox.

  This Ultimate Edition DVD is the best of any DVD package I have ever seen.  First you are given the choice of seeing the theatrical version or the Restored Special Edition with nearly 16 minutes of important added footage included (but not shown in the theatrical version).
  This Special Edition in the Ultimate DVD Edition and Extreme DVD Edition includes the new scenes with Michael Biehn with Linda Hamilton which never should have been omitted in the first place.  I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton together again.  It made the movie for me.
  Included in the package is a 31-page Collector's Booklet.  On pages 28, 29, 30 you can locate, according to the listed restored notes, the chapters to look for on your ""Display"" for the newly restored scenes added.  Chapter 10 is important as well as Chapter 13, my favorite.
 On Disc 2 (Special Features) contains the rare provocative movie trailer of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the nude (smoke and mirrors) as The Terminator being rebuilt. As the camera pans from his backside to the front and then up to finally revealing the face of T2, Arnold Schwarzenegger says, ""I'll be back!"".  It was a special trailer to let the movie audience know Terminator 2 was in production.

Ultimate Edition. Lots of extras, interesting featurettes and documentaries.  You can sit for hours enjoying this entire Ultimate Edition.

The second DVD with the extras only has 2 featurettes about the making, one is just a bunch of scenes of the filming and the other is about ILM work on the effects ol ""liquid metal"" for the T-1000. For a 2 DVD set the extras are poor. There are a couple of things like this software to make you look like a battered T-800 but those are for PC's. So the extras are poor.
If you don't have any edition of the T2 series, this one will do, but I think the UE is far better, if you like the extras and stuff. The only thing this DVD has is the commentary from Cameron. That's the main thing to get this one instead of the UE.

2135956,5,B0002WYTWG,"Arnold is a favorite target of jokes now that he's older and has slipped, but he had quite a run, whether you begin the count with Conan or with Terminator. He was some moneymaker. And you can't find a better hero for a sci-fi thriller. Who else has those eyes, or that gaptooth or that accent?
I consider the original Terminator to be slightly better than the sequel T2, which no doubt gets added help from its ground breaking, and still astonishing special visual effects. (Come to think about it, how far has ILM gone after Robert Patrick's T-1000 in ""Terminator 2""? Not very far. You have Mystique from X-Men and that clunky CGI Hulk. Even Mystique is just a revision of T-1000.) Terminator gets my nod for the original story, which not only changed the way we average folks view reality (a phenomenon that must have inspired a few grins from physicists who understood Einstein), but also inspired such movies as ""Back to the Future"" and ""Matrix"".
What else do I like about Terminator? Like all those classic surprise hits, it wasn't made to actually become a classic, with its creators expecting little out of it. You know, like Casablanca, the first Star Wars, Blair Witch and Funny Cide (the horse).
I also like Terminator because Arnold was a villain, and he had always been better as a villain, whether as himself in ""Pumping Iron"" or as Mr. Freeze in ""Batman and Robin"". Or as the Terminator.
There's something almost supernatural about the scare factor of this cyborg. It's simple, brutal logic (I don't know how Sarah Connor looks like, so why not simply knock off everyone named Sarah Connor?). Its very concept, a robotic assassin that passes itself off as regular guy, is scary. In Kyle Reese's flashback, when an unnamed terminator penetrates the humans' lair and wreaks such havoc Reese loses Sarah Connor's picture, there was the fleeting moment where Reese sees the terminator through the flames, its red eyes flashing, almost something out of a horror movie, a vampire or a werewolf, a ruthless, unstoppable monster. And of course, those naked terminators, shorn of their human skin, prowl like an army of skeletons, eyes in their sockets relentlessly seeking human prey. We've always been fascinated by things that could eat us (""Jaws"", lions, crocodiles, vampire movies). The Terminator was such a one.
When the police department shootout commences, you cannot help but cheer for the Terminator, at the back of your mind perhaps those glorious Westerns that had the hero fighting a whole gang of evil gunfighters singlehanded, or Toshiro Mifune in ""Yojimbo"" facing similar odds. You cheer, but it's the bad guy you're rooting for. This guy was cool.
But the best thing I like about Terminator is it doesn't apologize. Nor does it pretend. Compared to the sequel, which drowned in the young John Connor's (Edward Furlong) brimming political correctness, the original Terminator movie was a shin breaker. It doesn't just rock, it's a rock.",1057708800,,2959,4.908183632734531
2135957,4,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron was sick as a dog in Rome. He was working the on post-production of his first film as a director (Piranha 2)when he dreamed up The Terminator. Although it wasn't offically acknowledged for some time, Cameron was inspired by The Outer Limits and episodes like Harlan Ellison's Solider. Regardless, of the inspiration Cameron's take on the material created a new subgenre within film--tech noir.

The Terminator works amazingly well even when it has no reason to do so. Cameron's understanding of moviemaking along with that of his collaborators Gale Anne Hurd (his co-writer on the final screenplay helping to flesh out Sarah Conner's character among many other things), Stan Winston (who build the Terminator exoskeletons and worked on the make up), music composer Brad Fidel and cinematographer Adam Greenberg helped create a viable action packed science fiction classic of the 80's.

The plot is as familar as the taste of chicken noodle soup--The Terminator is send into the past to kill Sara Conner. Conner will be the mother of the human resistance movement. He becomes instrumental in defeating Skynet a computer software program that literally takes control of the world and uses the weapons humans have developed to attempt to wipe out humanity.

John Conner, Sarah's son in the future, sends back one of his soliders Kyle to save Sarah's life and prevent the Terminator from taking her life. What ensues is a battle between human and machine that acts as a microversion of what is going to occur in the future.

While the popular sequel is a better film all around, the original has grit missing from Cameron's slicker effort. The third film in the series Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine manages to recapture some of the grit of the original and combine it with the operatic and convoluted plot of the second film. Whatever The Terminator lacks in sophisticated visual effects, it more than makes up for in solid storytelling and a b-movie sensibility that works well.

While I like the two sequels, The Terminator established a new subgenre in film and helped spawn countless imitations. It created a new template.

The transfer is very good although it still has quite a few analog artifacts and defects. Still, the transfer is crisp, clean and sharp looking. The disc is an interesting amalgamation of two different discs. The movie is on one side in a dual layered format for optimal visual quality. The transfer is from a new digital master from a high definition transfer (which might explain why so many flaw are evident). The remix into 5.1 sound is also high quality as well and very good. The original mono soundtrack is included for comparison.

There isn't an audio commentary for the entire picture like T2 but there is a sequence of deleted scenes with Cameron's comments on them. There are a number of original storyboards included on the second side along with the other supplentary material. This is on a single layered side of the disc. Additionally, trailers, new interviews and a new documentary are included. All in all, this version is an improvement on the very good laserdisc from 7 years ago.",1057622400,,3142,4.928166351606805

Arnold also reached his high at this point. A new standard was set for movie makers.  All the great special effects such as the Lord of the Rings exist because James Cameron took the chance which he has done many times.
This DVD is almost perfect.  The picture is flawless and a THX soundtrack that sang from my sound system.  The new digital transfer was bright and crisp.

2135970,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terimnator 2 exceeded the expectations after the acclaimed Terminator.  James Cameron is a great filmmaker and should make more movies than he has.  Arnold gives his usual performance but Linda Hamilton really stood out along with a young Edward Furlong.
the plot:  John Connor is now a young boy and is in grave danger of a new terminator sent to destroy him before he becomes the leader in the future.  John Connor (in the future) sends another model of the 1st terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect john from the new terminator (Robert Patrick).  This is all happening while Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in a mental institution after the Skynet Software company covered up the 1st battle of the terminator.  She was sent there as insane because she believed what Reese (The Terminator) told her about John and the future and the terminators.
While escaping the mental asylum John is being chased (in a remarkable chase scene..almost as good as The Matrix Reloaded) after by Robert Patrick.  Arnold comes to save the day and they make it out safely.  the terminator and john go to group up with Sarah.  After they're together The Terminator explains why he came to protect John and also explains what judgement day is...(Andrew Dison recieved the terminator hand from the cover up of the mess in their hydrogen plant...therefore he is destined to make the terminators that will destroy the human race...with a chip and the hand.) Sarah tells them what to do.  Obviously she planned ahead for Judgement day and stored guns underground where her spanish buddy Enrique lived and were.  Sarah has a dream of Judgement Day and acts quickly.  She decides that she'll change the future of the terminators by killing Dison but she has a change of heart before she kills him.  The Terminator and John show up and lay down the whole thing in front of Dison.  That he would be responsible for 3 billion deaths in the future.  So they decide to destroy everything that would make a terminator.  The chip, the hand, his house, and most importantly the Skynet Company.  From there the action takes off.
James Cameron has made a fantastic movie.  Overall I think it's better than the 1st one.  The version i saw was on Tv but i plan on buying the T2 Extreme DVD.  Excellent Sci-Fi movie.  Arnold's best.",1057536000,,2302,4.777215189873417
2135971,5,B0002WYTWG,"The original Terminator movie became an instant classic action movie for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and director James Cameron. With T3 coming out, here's a review of that original movie.
First, you have to remember that in 1984 when this first came out, the whole gritty future-view a la Blade Runner (1982) was just taking hold. Along comes Terminator which melds that future-is-bleak theme with modern day action, and throw a muscle-man and tender-turned-tough woman into the mix.
I am a HUGE fan of this movie for many, many reasons. You have Linda Hamilton as a normal, every day woman who resists what is going on - and in the end finds her strength to go on. That transformation is just amazing. You have the love story between her and the 'normal man' who is sent back in time to try to defend her. And of course you have the 'machine' - Arnold - who single-mindedly works to track her down and destroy her.
There are just so many touches in the movie that show the care that James Cameron put into the film, making it truly the 'baby' of him, Arnold and Linda. This isn't your average action movie where the high bodycount and infinite ammo are key. It is a movie with a lot of thought, with well laid out backgrounds and the time changes between the ""current future"" of 2029 and the ""current present"" of 1984 show great connections.
Linda Hamilton in this was always a huge role model to me and many of my friends. She wasn't special. She didn't have ninja training or robotic eyeballs. But she saw what had to be done, and she gathered her strength and did it.
A great movie in its own right, and a must-see for anyone interested in T3!",1057449600,,1659,4.514950166112957
2135972,5,B0002WYTWG,T2 is an excellent film...enough said. It still holds up 12 years later. The special effects still look realistic as ever and the movie looks as if it just came out. In '91 T2 looked absolutley amazing and in '03 it still does. T3 even pales in comparison. T2 is of course better than the first Terminator and definatley better than the dissappointing T3. Theres six hours of extras on the DVD and its all you'll ever need.,1057449600,,423,4.435897435897436
2135973,5,B0002WYTWG,"It is absolutely amazing to think that ""The Terminator"" was made on a shoestring budget of ""only"" $6 million, where the filmmakers were literally sleeping on couches and living off of coupons from McDonald's to making the transition to ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day!  Taking that into consideration and then looking at the over $150 million dollar budget for T2, which was the first of its kind, one can only sit back in awe at the silver screen masterpiece that was created by that budget.
With ""The Terminator"" being James Cameron's first feature film and the film that went far beyond ""Conan the Barbarian"" in launching Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, the demand for this sequel was constant and finally overwhelming, leading them to begin it's filming in 1990.  The final outcome of that filming and budget being one of the highest grossing films to ever have been made, to date of which, the film has earned nearly a billion dollars, which is simply astonishing!
From a personal standpoint, when this film made it to the silver screen, I believe I went and saw it at least two times and I even read the book that was released concurrently with the film.  The VHS tape release of it was rather worn out as well due to this being such a compelling and captivating story!
The premise:
Enhancing upon the basic story and theme of the first film which was the first of many paradox's within this plot, director James Cameron brings us forward approximately ten years.  We're brought to the Terminator's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) introduction as he does essentially the same thing he did in the first film, seek clothing and weaponry.  From the very beginning of this film you see that it still has the same dark undertones of humanities future struggle against the machines but at the same time its going to have a different style as there is some humorous scenes right up front.
From there we're taken to the T-1000's (Robert Patrick) introduction in the film.  At this point in time, the viewer who hasn't seen this masterpiece before doesn't quite know which of the Terminators is going to be the bad guy.  From there we're taken to the introductions of John Connor, played rather well by Edward Furlong and then his mother Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton reprising her role from the first film.
It doesn't take one long to figure out that this is a big film and that the action is going to blow you away whether you're seeing it for the first time or the tenth time.  Few films of this genre even come close to comparing to the scale and scope that is T2 Judgment Day!  Everything about this film from the script to the actors and their acting to the makeup and the soundtrack all screams box office smash hit!
As you can surmise, I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of the genre and fans of superb scriptwriting played out to perfection on the silver screen.  {ssintrepid}

Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a girl trying to make it in the world when all of the sudden, a man and a machine appear in her life, one trying to kill her, and one who will do anything to protect her.  Kyle Reesce (Micheal Bein) is a soldier sent back through time by Connor's unborn son John who's mission is to stop a T-800 series Terminator (Arnold Can't-Spell-His-Last-Name Schwarzzenegar) from killing her, thus killing John.  John is the leader of the human resistance against an army of hostile machines that have nearly destroyed the human race.  The Terminator is a state-of-the-art machine with living human tissue surrounding a metal endoskeleton that feels no pain, no pity, and will never stop until Connor is dead or it is destroyed.  For such a low budget, this movie is very well done.  The story is very well-written, the actors are great, especially Arnold, and for the money they had, the special effects aren't too shabby.  In fact, this movie was so well-received that it granted its sequels the two highest budgets in film history.  This is a classic sci-fi movie that won't disappoint.

2135977,5,B0002WYTWG,"Before there was The Matrix and a dark vision of the future with machines dominating humanity there was The Terminator!  With its dark vision, extraordinarily well laid out plot and ""Arny"" starring as the bad guy, this film was destined to succeed.  Not only was there an outstanding script, written and directed by James Cameron, but those starring in the film made it the success that it is and only to be matched by its sequel.
The Terminator is James Cameron's first film and arguably the best film of his career.  While ""Conan the Barbarian"" put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map, The Terminator put him in the dead center of the map and launched him on a streak of highly successful action movies.  It was extremely interesting to watch a couple of the Special Features and find out that James Cameron and crew were basically putting this outstanding sci-fi classic together on a shoestring budget!
The great thing about Arny in this movie is that he didn't even have to say much, he just had to be cool and it worked perfectly for him.  Linda Hamilton performs admirably as we see her character go through the change from the shy and sheltered young woman to the somewhat hardened heroine by the end of the film.  Michael Biehn's performance as the sacrificial hero of the film is perfect!  Along with the outstanding leading cast, look at the secondary characters, to name just a couple, Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield.  Even one of James Cameron's favorites, Bill Paxton has a small role in this extraordinary film.
The more interesting aspect of this film when put in the light of the first two films and the third one that's in the theaters now is from a story standpoint where this first film is just the first paradox of the many that come about throughout the films, raising several ""what ifs"" about the ""whole"" story!
The premise:
We're brought into the film brilliantly as we see The Terminator make his trip through time, showing up and not taking any ""no"" answers to his request for the clothes of a young punk!  We're then taken to Sergeant Kyle Reese's time jump and a consequent search for clothes as well, but he's not so lucky and is immediately set upon by the police.  Jumping forward a bit, the Terminator has made his move and Reese has stepped in to try and save Sara.  While they're running from the Terminator and the police at the same time, some of the most imaginative filming in the history of film is going on as the scenes cut to the dark future of the early twenty first century and the machines are attempting to eradicate humanity.
I highly recommend this outstanding science fiction classic to all who haven't seen it yet, for it is truly one of the best films in the history of the genre and well worth repeated viewings.  I've watched this film many more times than I can remember but it was certainly great to see it in the widescreen DVD format, something I haven't seen since this film was in the theaters.  {ssintrepid}

2135978,5,B0002WYTWG,"Just when I thought I saw the best action/sci-fi flick of all time (The Terminator), Terminator 2 came out and I was even more amazed. Both of these movies prove that James Cameron is very talented as well as creative. Now on with the review... T2 is just as good as the first Terminator if not a little better. T2 might not have been as dark as the first but that is a matter of opinion. The role of Arnold changing from killer to protector thrilled audiences greatly and it was neat seeing John Connor trying to teach the terminator to be more human. And just to top it off, we have a more advanced killing machine (T-1000) whose mission is to terminate John Connor. I really liked that the T-1000 could not only imitate people but also wore a police uniform and had a little bit of personality to make people think it was human. The special effects for the T-1000 were excellent and Robert Patrick was very believable as a deceitful killing machine. Linda Hamilton did just as good of a job playing Sarah Connor in T2 as she did in the first movie. I liked the more fearless character of Sarah in T2. Edward Furlong who played John Connor did a good job playing a 10 year old even though I think that Edward at the time was really 13 years old.(He certainly had the foul mouth of a 13 year old in this movie). Anyway, Terminator 2 definately ranks up with The Terminator and should be enjoyed by all action/sci-fi fans.",1057276800,,1422,4.369811320754717
2135979,2,B0002WYTWG,"when is artisan finally going to stop releasing these stupid new edition dvds? I, as well as many other consumers, are getting irate and infuriated about purchasing a DVD which we think in the right frame of mind is the best that is out there, and the best that will ever be, and then the company turns around and releases a ""new and improved"" version. This is the fourth version of T2, I believe, which is stupid, ridiculous, and time-consuming. First there was the regular edition of T2, which was short lived (and also long out of print). Then, they go and release the THX version with improved surround sound and commentary (also out of print, I believe). After that comes the Ultimate Edition. I own this one, because I was summoned into thinking that this was the biggie. This was the bonus version that everybody just HAD to have. This came with a new set of commentary, deleted scenes, 2 different versions of the movie, easter eggs, and among MANY, MANY different options. I haven't even had the time to explore all of them yet. Here, about 6 to 8 months later, they release a NEW version of this DVD, called the EXTREME version...how pathetic. This has everything that the Ultimate version has, except the new liquid camera movements that most people don't have the equipment and technology in their own home to handle. I think this was probably a ...poor shot at a promotion for the new T3 movie. This makes me infuriated, because they have also done the exact same with the first installment in the Terminator series. Sure, it's a great bargain that you can pick it up in stores for $$ brand new, but the fact that I had to pay [more] for mine makes me mad.
To the point of this review  :  If you already own T2 on DVD, then pass on this one, but if you're looking for a good installment to your series and are thinking about adding T2 to your collection, give this one a green light.

The features are bleak with the exception of the New audio commentary with James Cameron and a couple of DVD-Rom features. If you have the UE, rent this version and watch the new master because it is the best the movie has ever looked. If you don't own any copies of T2, I suggest you buy this version but don't expect alot of features because there are like 2-3 documentaries and DVD-ROM material that is about it! But if you really want to get in depth behind the scenes material find a copy of the Ultimate Edition if it is still available. The movie looks and sounds good on there but it isn't as good as on the Xtreme. If you have a widescreen TV and want to see how good the new master is, go out and check it out because there isn't a single scratch on the screen not even dust or anything other than the crystal clear video.

  The Terminator is original and well directed by James Cameron in his first outing directing. Although the sequels are good it's a shame they all pretty much have the same plot. I mean each one has one future being sent from the future to protect and one to destroy. The 4th needs different material for it to work. I think they just need the future war against machines in that one. I'm not sure how Arnold will fit in though as the Terminator is sent from the future looking human to blend in. In the part 4if it's the war against machine why would they need a Terminator that looks like Arnold ? Mean the machines have no reason to have skin on and look human in the future.

The dictionary definition of `Ultimate' is Final, last, definitive, yet Artisan release the Extreme edition, surely this breaches the Trades Description Act 1968: Which prohibits false or misleading descriptions of goods or services.

This way the consumer can make an informed choice, knowing exactly what they are buying.
 Production studios must realise fans such as myself are becoming very exhausted and bored with such commercial antics, hence why a majority of us purchase from other countries. if this continues we will loose great faith in companies such as Artisan and end up just waiting this the film is released in a final ultimate box set, even though when you believe it is the final version, an improved set is released...
Will Artisan be willing to send a copy of the Extreme edition to all fans that purchased the Ultimate edition free of charge if the consumer has proof of purchase? Only then they may convince me to own the Extreme Edition DVD set.
Although Terminator 2 is an all time classic, the attitude to the consumer from produciton studios is dubious and wearing thin, hence 1 star.",1056931200,,1686,5.053956834532374
2135984,5,B0002WYTWG,"That's what I call a Digital Versatile Disc(DVD). A new era in the technology of DVD. Disc one contains the Special Edition version of the film and a great feature. Yes, you can select the Interactive Mode and watch the film while reading the details of each scene. You can also watch the behind the scene of the specific scenes while you are watching the movie by pressing Enter when a Cyberdone logo appears. Disc two contains some features just for your fun and two new documantaries and the theatrical version of film in high definition which I wasn't able to play it, Because it requires a powerful PC. Note that one of the requirements is a 3GHZ processor. And it has an amazing metal case which distinguishes this DVD from all the DVDs you have ever bought.
Don't ever think that you don't need it if you have the Ultimate Edition. You should have both of these DVDs. And I don't know how much longer we should wait to see a new release of T2!!!!!",1056931200,,954,4.426136363636363
2135985,5,B0002WYTWG,"Well, people have nearly said it all about this new DVD edition.
But I just wanted to add a few things:
The version in this Extreme DVD, is the ""Special Extended edition"". Despite what it says on the menu, it is not the plain special edition. It actually includes all the possible deleted escenes they ever took out (t-1000 scanning john's room and the alternative ending are accesible via watching the movie on ""interactive mode"").
And some people are saying that the only way to see the theatrical version is by playing the disc on your computer's DVD-ROM, on windows media 9 series. Well, that is not true. You can watch the theatrical version on your normal DVD player. Just highlight (red) ""sensory control"", then on your remote control press the ""right"" button 5 times. To the right, the phrase ""The future is not set"" will appear. Then press ""enter"" on your remote control, and the ""play special edition"" will morph into ""theatrical version"". There you have it.",1056585600,,968,4.767857142857143
2135986,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is one of the better put together packages for a DVD. It includes two cuts of the film (the theatrical version and the special director's cut) which are nice inclusions. The extended cut is nice because it allows you to see how the deleted scenes fit into the movie, and unlike many movies, the deleted scenes were given full production, i.e., they are finished celluloid, not just spot copies or some such. There are plenty of extras to keep even the most intrepid fan busy, including theatrical trailers and commercials from around the globe, and that is nice as well. Very well done DVD!",1056585600,,595,4.6761904761904765
2135987,5,B0002WYTWG,"After the moderate success of The Terminator, James Cameron decided to outdo himself with the old ""bigger is better"" modus operandi, and together with the greatest special effects maestros in Hollywood, created one of the most amazing sci fi action thrillers ever! This time around, Schwarzenegger was to be the good guy and fans were less than happy with the idea. The Austrian oak who immortilised himself as the unstoppable killing machine who spoke the famous line: ""I'll be back!"" But movie geeks had little reason to worry, for Cameron had something better up his sleeve, with the T1000, an even more invincible killing machine who could take on Arnie's T100. The tantilising premise and top-notch talent behind the collosal project ensured boffo box office. And once again, Arnie (with shades for added coolness) proved that when it comes to blowing up things with really big guns, there is no substitute.
The action set-pieces are some of the most incredible ever put together, and with Stan Winston's lethal creation and ILM's morphing liguid metal guy (a menacing Patrick Stewart) battling it out for the future of mankind, the stakes are high, and the action ante even higher. A seriously buffed-up Linda Hamilton is a much stronger character than in the first film, and her hard-edged persona is well-played and fits the film's ""come and get it!"" tone. While the original's tense structure and nerve-shredding pace makes it superior in terms of cracking action, but in terms of spectacle and jaw-dropping SFX, T2 wins hands down. Wether this of the seminal original is the best is debatable, but what is for sure is that it is truly one awesome thrill ride packed with out-of-this world effects that still amaze 11 years later. Will the upcoming Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines be better? Only time will tell, but rest assured, T2 takes it deserved place in the collection of all-time greats and is a must-have on DVD.",1056585600,,1933,4.932515337423313
2135988,5,B0002WYTWG,"It's hard to believe that The Terminator was Arnold Schwarzenegger's Big Break (movies like Conan the Barbarian don't count).  After all, he does very little besides buying heavy artillery and trying to destroy everything in his way.  And he only has a handful of lines -- but one of those lines is his now-famous line, ""I'll be back"" (which is actually a surprisingly less-than-meaningful line).
Still, the movie was a hit -- and some may even say it's a classic -- and it established Arnold as a serious force to be reckoned with.
Schwarzenegger plays a cyborg (a robot that appears to be human) that is sent from the year 2029 back to 1984 on an important mission.  He must kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son, John Connor, is destined to become a leader in the humans' battle against the machines that control their world.  To protect his mother -- and his own existence -- Connor sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to destroy the Terminator.
The Terminator is plain and simple action -- right from the beginning.  And I'll be honest -- I enjoyed it.  It's fast-paced and exciting -- and the story's not bad, either.  The Terminator is a movie from The Good Old Days of action films -- when they didn't try to pretend to be something else -- and it's worth seeing.",1056585600,,1283,4.6255506607929515

On the note of T3, I must say I'm a little dissapointed. Not that I won't see the movie, but the whole ""save John"" plot is gettin old. I think that T4 should either be based on his father, Kyle Reese, or on the war itself. Either way this movie is classic, and I plan to see any further Terminator movie in the future.",1055894400,,477,4.139784946236559

The so-called improved picture in the Extreme edition is not noticeable compared to the Ultimate edition.  The Ultimate edition contains more versions of the movie and also has the DTS soundtrack that the Extreme edition lacks.  If you already own the Ultimate edition, don't waste your money on the Extreme edition.",1055721600,,426,5.057142857142857
2135993,4,B0002WYTWG,"I already owned the prior ""Ultimate Edition"", so the idea of an ""Extreme Edition"" was a bit questionable from the start.
Yes, It's a great movie.
Yes, It's got lots of extra scenes and goodies including the Director's commentary.
But... NO, the High Definition version will not work in all PCs.
If you plan on viewing the High Definition version... FORGET ABOUT IT!  Personally, I hate to watch movies on my PC.  I'd rather sit on my couch and fire up the good old fashioned TV.  But, just out of curiosity, I bought this edition and thought I'd see what all the fuss was about.  BAD MOVE!  Look at the package and you'll see, the High-Definition version only plays on very High-End PCs.
""Recommended System Requirements for T2: High-Definition""
- Windows XP PROFFESIONAL
- 512 MB RAM
- 3 GHz Processor!
- 128 MB / 3D Video
- 24 Bit 96 KHz Multichannel Sound Card
- Internet Connection (for the license to play it to download)
- 1600 x 1200 or 1920x1080 or HIGHER display!
I don't know about you, but those are some hefty specifications to watch a movie... and even if you have that, in my opinion, you're still better off with a skipping the PC and playing the regular version in a regular DVD player.
I tried to play it on a relatively new Sony Vaio laptop (the only PC I have that has XP (however it was not XP Professional as listed in the recommended requirements).  Anyhow, my Sony is a 1.6 GHz unit, and it couldn't keep up at all.  What I got was a crude slideshow with a still image every 5 or so seconds.  None of my PCs are 3 GHz, so the HD version is useless.",1055548800,,1571,4.319727891156463
2135994,4,B0002WYTWG,"The Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2 was (and still is) an epic achievement among DVDs releases, with great picture, multiple versions of the film, and an almost dizzying number of special achievements.
So why mess with a good thing?
Besides the blatant attempt to create a tie-in to Terminator 3, the new ""Extreme DVD"" has some different special features (which is similar to squeezing an already crushed orange for juice), improved picture (most noticeable on regular TVs in that the ""shadow bars"" surrounding the actual widescreen picture inherent to many Artisan releases is missing), and a commentary by James Cameron.
Granted, the improved picture and commentary are nice (particularly for the discussion of the scenes omitted from the Theatrical Version), but it's not particularly worth it if you have the Ultimate Edition (unless you have a DVD-ROM drive). Throw in a somewhat difficult package (I personally managed to nearly destroy the inner case's label when first pulling it out of the metal outer casing), and you've got a release that requires some thought before purchasing if you have the Ultimate Edition already, or can easily find it.",1055376000,,1155,5.181818181818182
2135995,5,B0002WYTWG,"Well, now I own the 'Extreme' edition of this movie.  I also own the 'Ultimate' edtion which came out a awhile back.  If I had know that this edition was going to come out, I would have waited.  As great as this edition is, and this is the one to own, I still feel like I got suckered.  Oh well.  Everyone has probably seen this movie, so I seen no need to do a review, but know this is the best possible print of the movie on DVD.  There's actually like three versions of the movie here, the theatrical release, the additional footage version, and a version to watch on your computer which should provide a much higher definition picture.  And the sound is the best I've ever heard.  To really experience it, it must be witnessed on a proper sound system, with surround sound and all that stuff.  The extras are plentiful to the point of being almost too much.  The two complaints I have seemed to be shared by others.  The plastic DVD case comes ensconced in a metal slipcase, which looks really nice....until you try to slide the plastic case out of the metal slipcase.  It's such a tight fit that the plastic case gets damaged.  Why couldn't they have done like a metal tin or something than this slipcase I don't know.  The other complaint is why didn't they just release this version from the get go?  To make more money, I suppose, but I find it really annoying that this seems to be becoming a more common practice, releasing different versions of a movie, starting with the barebones version, and then throwing extras in for the later versions, just to squeeze a few more dollars out of our pockets.  BTW, this version does also have the directors' commentary of the movie, something which I don't think was available in the previous version.",1055289600,,1751,4.476340694006309

The sound is incredible and is 24 bit 5.1EX.  The picture is even better than the new Charlie's Angles SuperBit DVD.  This is a great video to get especially if you have a HDTV.

2135997,4,B0002WYTWG,"If your interested in the real differences from a technical perspective then here it goes:
The ultimate Edition DVD that has been out for about a year now has the best special features and extras.
The new just released EXTREME EDITION, the very DVD on this page, has the best picture and sound possible from the source material. The developers have gone back and copied the original source in extremely high resolution, of course your average TV can only get a fraction of the resolution this is actually displaying but High Definition TV can see it in all its glory. So in reality this DVD was made for the future high definition DVD players and HDTV systems that will be released probably within the next 3 years.
The EXTREME edition does have the best picture and sound because the bit-rates are much higher than the Ultimate Edition. But because of this the DVD can not hold as much extra features and such. The Extreme Edition does feature the first EVER James Cameron commentary on T2, and it is exceptionally interesting stuff! If you don't own the Ultimate Edition then this Extreme Edition is definitely worth it. But if you do own the Ultimate Edition, you probably would be fine without this DVD unless you absolutely must have the best experience possible regardless of special features or you are a collector or extreme fan of the series. Think of this edition as a companion to your Ultimate Edition.",1055203200,,1414,4.728744939271255
2135998,2,B0002WYTWG,"Of course I was interested hearing that they were going to be releasing a 1080p version of the movie.  And I wondered if it was going to be worth purchasing this version, considering the add'l 16 minutes of footage were included on the previous Ultimate Edition (albeit by way of an Easter Egg, as it were).  So of course, I purchased it.  I have not actually watched the whole thing yet, and I will explain why.  But first let me say that the picture and sound were phenomenal.  I do not have Dolby ES, but DTS, but it still sounded great.  The picture was not to be believed at how clear.  I do have progressive, albeit only 480p (not the 1080p touted by the DVD - are there really any 1080p TVs out there?  Mine does 1080i - did it make a difference?  Not sure, but it looked pretty awesome to me!)
Anyway, the one 'flaw' with this edtition, and the reason I am even writing this, is this ... they chopped off the sides of the film!  I can't believe out of all of these reviews, that no one had mentioned this little shortcoming of this version. They clearly explain in the enclosed booklet that they took a 2.35:1 (wider) format and chopped it down to 1.85:1 to fit the standard widescreen TVs.  It sounds like they only did this so that the presentation would be clearly 1080(p) (not to make liars out of them? dunno).  Otherwise, as they explain, there would be black bars at the top/bottom that would take away precious viewing from the full 1080 lines of resolution.

Well, (Hello?!) I don't know about you, but the major reason that I even purchase Widescreen versions of DVDs at all is to GET THE WHOLE PICTURE!  I WANT to see what's going on at the extreme periphery of the scenes.  I admit I did start watching this edition, and, after having read how they masacred the panarama, I wanted to see if I noticed anything.  Well, the first scene they show through the Terminator's eyes - y'know all the data stuff happening on the sides of the screen - he was sizing up the Biker Dude to see if he could fit into his clothing -  well, it was very clearly and obviously Chopped Off.  I shut the thing off and have been contemplating bringing it back to Media Play for a refund for the reason of False Advertising.  Although, now, reading in these pages, someone is saying there might be an additional Extended (by 2 mins) version of the film - although not sure since it appears this person was referring to a foreign version.  So I might give his Easter Egg a try - and he claims something about he 2.35:1 A/R.  We'll see.
So I gave this a '2' rating, because as much as what you could see was pretty awesome in comparision with previous (or any) versions, resolution-wise, I was not happy with the 'widescreen pan & scan' thing they pulled.",1055116800,,2749,4.372047244094488
2135999,5,B0002WYTWG,"Simply put this was Arnold's best action flick ever.  The story, acting, special effects are all superb for a movie that was released in 1984.  Terminator 2 was also a great movie, but moreso for the incredible (at least for 1991) special effects, and not as much for the story.  Basically Terminator and T2 are both AWESOME movies, but T1 was better, even if the special effects look dated nearly 20 years later.
Buy this DVD, and T2. You won't be dissapointed.",1055116800,,462,4.609756097560975

The movie entertained me(still has after a million times) but let's face it, when i bought this i thought this was going to be better than the Ultimate Edition DVD. Hence the name Extreme Ed. Boy was I wrong. This was one of my least favourite DVD purchases. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great and its iconic but the DVD, just isn't up to par with me.

My friend has a Sony Vaio with an Intel P4, 2GHZ processor and found that by saving the new high definition version to hard drive, he was able to enjoy the film without skips.  He does not recommend pausing the film, but watching straight through to avoid problems.  The movie experience is unlike any other when viewed on his 21"" flat trinitron monitor.

2136004,4,B0002WYTWG,"It's pretty obvious that with the looming release of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in July, this new edition release of Terminator 2 on DVD is pretty much a money making ploy by Artisan to cash in.  All that aside (and despite the constant comparisons between this and the previously released Ultimate Edition), this Extreme DVD isn't all that bad.  The new commentary by James Cameron and William Wisher is interesting to hear and I find much better than the pre-recorded and overlapping one found in the Ultimate Edition DVD.  The picture and sound are unbelieveable; never before have I seen or heard the film in such rich picture and sound quality.  The other special features however, are absolutely not worth owning if you already have the previously released Ultimate Edition.  Besides the two featurettes, you get to watch the extended version of the film on Disc 1, and the theatrical version on Disc 2 if you have a DVD-Rom drive in your computer.  Plenty of other special features like those featured in the Ultimate Edition DVD would have been more than welcome here, especially if you missed out on owning the aforementioned DVD.  As we all know, the film itself is an action/sci-fi classic that set the standard for modern day computer generated special effects and continued a complex yet compelling storyline.  All in all, if you did miss out on the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, this Extreme DVD edition is worth picking up, but if you already own the Ultimate Edition stick with it.",1054944000,,1509,4.821705426356589
2136005,4,B0002WYTWG,"The Audio commentary prvided by Cameron and Wisher is the highlight of this new DVD edition of T2, which in my opinion is the most exciting, entertaining, and informative special feature of DVDs.  The interactive guide is a nice touch.  In fact, most of the  useful behind the scenes footage from the ""Ultimate"" edition is contained in the brief interactive segments.  On the other hand, most of the DVD-ROM features are pointless and silly, especially the build your own robot game.  Also, the trailers are not included on this disc, which is annoying.",1054944000,,553,4.903225806451613
2136006,4,B0002WYTWG,"""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" needs no explanation, so let's skip to the ""Extreme Edition"" attributes-
Video/Audio
By far, one of the best-looking DVD videos that I've seen to date.  Crystal-clarity that is even an improvement over the previous ""Ultimate Edition.""  Audio is nothing spectacular, but still great.
New ""never-before-seen"" footage is included in the movie.  If you want to see the old theatrical version though, here's how: On Disc One, highlight ""Sensory Control"" and press RIGHT 5 times.  You'll be given the option to play the Theatrical version.
Special Features
On Disc One, you can find a very good commentary with the Director, James Cameron.
On Disc Two, there are 2 ""featurettes""-
The first is ""No Feat But What We Make"" which is a wonderful documentary detailing the development of the visual effects (most notably, the groundbreaking CGI) in the film.
The second is ""T2: On the Set"" which is a more or less interesting look at life on and around the production of the movie.
Included on this disc (for DVD-ROM owners) is a new ""high defintion"" Theatrical version of the movie playable on Windows Media Player.  In order to even play it though, your PC is going to need a LOT of horsepower.
Some other DVD-ROM features include some Terminator ""morphing"" games for portraits and another game where you can create a Skynet Combat Chassis.
The packaging is nice too.",1054857600,,1387,4.961206896551724
2136007,4,B0002WYTWG,"I thought that this movie was perhaps one of the best movies of the eighties.  Arnold is great in this movie, and so is Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.  It has a great storyline and a very intricate plot.  There have been many other reviews so I will not go into plot detail but I will tell you why I didn't give this movie 5 stars.  1] Reese leaves Sarah ALONE to get supplies??!!  How stupid of him and then he gives her a PISTOL to protect herself while he is gone!  PLEASE.  After all his hard work protecting her he leaves her alone.  Wow.  2] When Sarah is making the bombs for Reese she is screwing the cap and she does it a little too hard and he tells her ""gently, gently"".  Then a short while later after he tells her he loves her he gets mad at himself for saying that and he goes to the bag and starts literally throwing the bombs in the bag.  He is too smart for that I think.  Oh well some minor flaws but overall the movie was good.",1054684800,,949,4.016042780748663
2136008,4,B0002WYTWG,"Last night I watched the hidden version included in the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, and its always interesting watching the deleted scenes, and seeing what versions of the movie have what extra features. Now let me get this straight. According to the ultimate alternative ending, Judgement Day did not happen, as the future is not set, and John Connors went on to become a Congressman, instead of a leader of the resistance. So Sarah Connors spends half of her adult life smuggling guns, blowing things up, assasinating people, and being locked away in a psycho ward for telling people that machines from the future were sent to kill her and her son John. We won't even touch the millions of dollars worth of damage she caused to property. Yet, here she is 30 years later, walking around free as a bird. And even though these things she said would happen did not happen, she is still seen as a hero, and not a nutcase, and she runs around like a nutcase telling everyone that each day is a gift. A gift from whom? Since the future is not set, and assuming here that God has nothing to say about this, the gift must largely come from Sarah. Its just a moviem, and perhaps we don't really want to go in this direction. Maybe it was a good idea that this alternate ending was never used.
This Ultimate Edition of the second Terminator movie is one of the three best movies I have for sound. I have a Pioneer Elite sound system with 5.1, B & W speakers, and a Panasonic HD TV. My system rocks. Therefore, when a new edition was offered with better sound and picture, I was interested. I can say that my setup can tell the difference between very good and very, very good.

2136009,4,B0002WYTWG,"Ah, it's that time again.  After twelve years involving bankruptcy and multiple court cases, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, sequel to the star-making Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is finally going to arrive in theaters.  What most people don't realize, however, is that when they think of Terminator they think of Arnold Schwarzenegger duking it out with Robert Patrick's undestructable liquid robot.  These people don't know that the Terminator was not just a shoot-em-out flick.  The original, filmed in 1984 when Schwartzenegger was still considered young and strong, was the one that actually broke all the rules of movies.  Judgment Day was kind of like an expansion.  With a brilliant story and believable characters as well as a not too short yet not too long screenplay, Terminator exploded with beautiful action scenes, explosions, and gun-fights.  If you ask a true Terminator fan, I'm sure that he or she will say that they would rather choose the classic truck scene in the Terminator than the final battle between Arnold and Patrick. The Terminator truly does not have as much action as T2 but it brims with suspense and a romance story which fuels the addictive part of the film.  T2 was just battle to battle with several boring moments in between.  And personally, I enjoyed Schwartzenegger more as a villain than as a  world-saving cyborg.
Schwartzenegger along with Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn star in this original.  In the future (2027 or 2029) there is a gigantic war between the humans and machines, which are basically robots.  The machines have destroyed a large amount of humans but the humans are nonetheless winning the war because they are led by a strong and courageous leader by the name of John Connor.  Now go back to 1984.  Sarah Connor (Hamilton) is a waitress who dreads her terrible life.  She doesn't know that the son she will have will help the humans fight the machines almost fifty years later.  The machines, or cyborgs, create a plan in the future to send back one of them so he can kill Sarah Connor.  If he succeeds, she will not have the baby and the battle will be lost.  The humans, however, send back a human named Kyle Reese (Biehn) to protect Sarah as well as destroy the machine known as the Terminator to save the human race.
The acting in this film is not Oscar-deserving but still better than someone like Leonardo DiCaprio.  The stars magically pull it off and seem like real characters.  When you think about it, there are only about three or four actual fight scenes in the film but to see the plans that Kyle and the Terminator plan to kill each other are brilliant.  Kyle is after all able to take pain.  The Terminator is almost undestructable.  So go ahead, buy this flick that you should watch one Friday night when there is nothing good on TV.  Don't even watch the TV versions because they edit so much needed stuff from this film.  Be warned, though.  The film is rated R for strong violence, language, sexuality, and nudity.  You might try to keep the kids away from this but it seems that already half of them are gloating about the sequel and not looking at this masterpiece, which in my opinion, is fifty times better than the second.  Happy viewing.",1054339200,,3228,4.726296958855098

But I look at it now, and I can tell how old it is.  If you watch Terminator 2 before this, DO NOT expect this to be as good as part 2.  Terminator 2 is alot better than this one, and the special effects look clean even 12 years later.  Still, its a must see for all Terminator fans.",1053561600,,420,3.7386363636363638
2136011,4,B0002WYTWG,"Whem i think of sci-fi i usually think of good effects (The Fifth Element), decent actors (Kurt Russell, Stargate) and an odd story (The Fifth Element, Stargate). But T2 does the unthinkable by using all 3 of these qualities and blending them almost perfectly. And its a sequel (whats next? a good Burt Reynolds film!).
 Of course the effects are a littlke out of date by now and the stories been copied a thousand times (The Sherminator - Amnerican Pie for gods sake!)but the sheer class will never be redone.
Arnauld stays off the ""Sarah Conner?"" lines and even comes off life-like - pity hes playing a machine. Kudos to James Cameron for making this a more memorable affair than the originalk;although not as hard-hitting.
Any bad points? Not enough of Jason Patric's liquid metal effect and no character that measures up to Michael Biehns Kyle Reese of the original.
As you can see, the good points outway the bad and make this one of the best sci-fi ever. But can an extreme edition DVD (coming soon)retain the top sci-fi DVD place from The Matrix Revisted edition?
Buy either edition, there baisacally the same. This is early ninties cinema at its best add it to your collection yesterday, if not sooner.",1053129600,,1210,4.734597156398104
2136012,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator was the ultimate action/sci-fi explosion of the 80's.  It remains one of Arnolds best appearances under the brilliant writing/directing of James Cameron, who proved his protential to Hollywood with this film.  In fact almost everything was done well:  scripting, casting, editing, filmography, special effects.  You would never guess it was made on such a puny budget.  The Terminator launched the careers of it's cast and crew.  Arnold Schwarzenegger became an American movie icon.  Along with the incredible action story, the films human drama is touching and true to people.  The plots conclusion with the theme of predestination paradox works perfectly with the films level pacing.  Even if your not an action or sci-fi junkie, The Terminator is not to be missed.  (If you haven't seen it, see it soon before people start thinking you live in a cave.)  Don't miss the sequel.",1052179200,,894,5.138888888888889
2136013,5,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron has always been at the forefront of great film making. When he made the Abyss, nearly everyone was convinced he was something special. Well, Terminator 2:Judgement Day is his crowning glory.
The plot is simple.  A young boy, John Connor (Edward Furlong) is destined to become the leader of a resistance against an army of machines bent on destroying humanity.  The machine's A.I. soon figured out that wiping out John before he becomes this inspirational leader will make their task of world domination much easier.  So, they send a cyborg assassin(Robert Patrick) back through time to kill him.  However, the resistance know of this plan, and send their own cyborg(Arnold Schwarzenegger) back through time to protect John.  The scene is then set for a gripping and explosive game of cat and mouse as one machine tries to kill, while the other tries to protect.
What i loved about this movie was the contrast of characters. Arnie plays a heavy, superstrong solid metal bruiser, while Robert Patrick plays a sleek, superfast and very stylish killer.  The confrontations between these two warriors are inevitably explosive and great to watch, and what is even better is that the action sequences are not repetitive.  There are new ideas for every set piece, each one using great camera work and jaw dropping special effects.  It is the special effects in fact, that still make this film a CGI benchmark.
The real genius in the area of computer graphics was the creation of the Liquid Metal T-1000, the assassin sent to kill John.  This cyborg can shape change to mimic any person, and also to turn it's various body parts into brutal stabbing weapons. This could have been utterly botched, but Cameron has created an awesome piece of movie work.  When you watch the liquid metal sequences, remember that there were no advanced computers involved-this was all done using about 10 apple mac computers linked up together. Stunning.
The basic story is nothing new. Humans versus machines in a worldwide fight to the death has been seen in a lot of movies.  Well this movie is different.  Adding the time travel aspect to the Terminator movies was a master stroke, and the Terminator movies will remain as all time masterpieces of film making.  The first film was good-this film is amazing. An essential addition to any DVD collection.",1051574400,,2342,4.913705583756345
2136014,4,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron first came to fame with this groundbreaking sci-fi film, this was the first time that a sci-fi film was set in the modern world as we knew it at the time as opposed to outer space.
The story of this film involves time travel as a fact, not just a concept. The year is 1984, and life is going on as normal for everyone, until one fateful night when a creation of the year 2029 travels back in time. This creation is called a 'terminator', a killing machine which looks like a human which has been sent back in time to kill a young woman who is fated to give birth to a man who leads the human revolution against the machines. However, to ensure that his birth will prevail, the leader of the resistance,John Connor, sends a soldier under his command back to the same time in order to save his mother from being killed.
This film will be 20 years old next year, but nobody can have any doubt that it's a modern classic. The special effects of this film look crude compared to other sci-fi offerings of the past decade, however, the brilliance of this film is in the telling of the story and of James Cameron's ability to convey the story by using other characters to talk about other events that have happened ie. the name of the woman targeted by the terminator is Sarah Connor. The terminator, not knowing exactly who she is, kills another two women by the same name. But instead of seeing him kill both women, you see and hear two detectives talking about two murder case reports received that day in the precinct.
The extra features of this DVD are simply excellent, some of the deleted scenes make other scenes in the film make more sense. There is a retrospective interview with James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger, interesting bits of trivia such as James Cameron originally having Arnold in mind to play the part of the protecting soldier and have O.J Simpson play the terminator(?!). If you are a big fan of all things sci-fi, classic or modern, go out and buy this DVD.",1051142400,,1995,4.468493150684932
2136020,3,B0002WYTWG,"Arnold Schwartnegger was a little known bodybuilder from Graz Austria when director, James Cameron decided to cast him in the role of the cyborg killing machine, ""The Terminator"".  Yes, Arnie had already won multiple Mr. Olympias and starred in ""Pumping Iron"" and the original ""Conan"" movies.  But nothing put him over the top like this sci-fi thriller.
MGM gives us a much improved rendering of this movie on DVD.  The original release had been marred by excessively grainy images, soft details and some major color bleeding.  In this new incarnation (reportedly master in hi-def)we get a smoother looking print that is still soft. Shadow delineation can be well represented at times and generally weak at others. Ditto on the contrast levels, particularly in the dimly lit night club scene. But the excessive edge enhancement and shimmering fine details present on the original DVD are completely gone on this remastered special edition.  One fine note for the younger generation tuning into this movie for the first time.  The special effects have dated considerably.  These were the days before computer generated graphics.  Although every attempt has been made to clean up and slightly retouch the original film effects, they do not hold up to what is being offered up today.  I rather like that.
The soundtrack of this DVD has been remastered to 5.1.  It's incredibly dated but well represented nonetheless.
EXTRA FEATURES: We get the original documentary on the making of this movie as well as the superbly realized retrospective with interviews from all of the principle players.  There's also an audio commentary and some stills and a theatrical trailer.
BOTTOM LINE: A marked improvement over the original DVD release but this version still leaves something to be desired.",1050796800,,1782,5.152777777777778
2136021,5,B0002WYTWG,"Most sequels are imperfect remakes of the originals that they were based upon. However, (and not including trilogies), once in awhile a sequel is made that is worthy of its predecessor. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is such a movie.
The original movie is a great piece of science fiction action cinema. T2 follows the story about a decade where the original ended. The original Terminator, the T-800, that Skynet had first sent back into time had failed to eliminate Sarah Connor before her son was born. However, a backup plan had already been thought of and the massive computer sent another Terminator, the T-1000 (an experimental model) further ahead into time to terminate John Connor before he reached maturity. However, the human resistance had their game on and sent another protector back in time, too. This time a Terminator would be a guardian.
Over a decade since it's original theatrical release, it is amazing how fresh and current T2 looks and feels. The action is intense, the special effects are state of the art, and the acting quite believable. The movie is full of allegorical allusions and subtle visuals that speak volumes. For example, as my brother pointed out, it's kind of frightening that T2 warns about machines taking over the world, yet we live in a society where many are totally dependent upon machines to do their bidding for them. Have machines already taken over and we just don't realize it? Not many sci-fi action pictures can make a person think that deeply.",1050624000,,1493,4.881889763779528
2136022,4,B0002WYTWG,"Just about everything that can be said about THE TERMINATOR has been said already. That in itself is a testament to the quality of the film and how monumental it has become. When this movie was made, Arnold Schwarzeneggar was just an up and coming action/adventure star who was still best known for his body building days; James Cameron was a little known director that the studios didn't trust enough to give him the type of budget he needed; and the phrase ""I'll be back"" was what people said when they left the house to go get groceries. THE TERMINATOR changed all that vaulting the careers of Arnold and Cameron and making ""I'll be back"" a part of the American vernacular. The film had a rather limited budget, but surprisingly the movie holds up rather well even after nearly two decades after it's making; some of the ""cheap sfx shots"" (e.g. The Terminator fixing his flesh and eyes) look better than some modern million dollar special effects shots. The story is strong and holds the movie together. Also, though this is an action movie, the acting is rather well done. About the only negative part of the film is the cheesy techno soundtrack and score; the music is about the only thing that dates the film. A great science fiction/action film and a film that anyone who is interested in American popular culture should watch.",1050451200,,1334,4.680851063829787

The movie starts out in Los Angeles, 1984. The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is sent back through time to kill a woman named Sarah (Linda Hamilton) before she gives birth to her future world leader son John because in the year 2029, the machines like the terminator are trying to wipe out mankind and John and his armies are defeating them. So he wants to kill her so he won't exist.
So one of John's best soldier's Reice Kyle (Michael Biehn) is sent to protect her. When the two men meet the starts to fight to the death. The Terminator will not stop at all costs to kill her and Reice won't stop until he is destroyed. So as they battle each other, Reice blows up a truck that the Terminator is driving in as he's chasing Sarah. The truck blows up but is he destroyed? NO! All of his skin burns off and you see the machine itself trying to kill Sarah. Again Reice blows up the Machine and is it finished? NO!! Even with a half body, the machine goes after her. Now Sarah has to finish him. Will she get rid of him?

Anyway, about the movie, it is a continuation of the Terminator saga where the T-1000 is now the protector of the future human leader of the resistance, John Connor, instead of the ruthless killer in the previous movie. T2 is laden with eye-popping action and special FX and also powerful emotions. I can't think of one thing I dislike about this classic movie.

When I first viewed Terminator 2: Judgement Day in the theater, I was blown away.  Since I got the Ultimate Edition of this DVD about three years ago, every time I watched it, I got the same thrill as I got the first time I witnessed not only one of the best action thrillers of all time, but on of the best dramas of all time.
Many viewers have referred to this movie as an action movie, but I consider it to be something much more, a drama.  This story of a young boy (John Connor), who befriends a machine from the future sent back to protect him from a ruthless ultra-advanced Terminator as he grows older, is very personal.  The movie is violent, but goes beyond pure violence and noise for ""shock value,"" and presents something truly special.  I continue to watch Terminator 2 with the same passion and interest as I expressed when I saw the original release.  And, the Ultimate Edition goes even further, putting footage that was never seen ino the feature.  Now, the story makes even more sense as you see how Sarah Connor struggles with the will to destroy John's protector, while John displays some of the traits that he will need as the future leader of the human resistance.
I very strongly recommend the purchase of this DVD.  You will not be disappointed by its appeal.
Take care, as Always,
--Daniel",1046390400,,1331,4.520833333333333
2136045,5,B0002WYTWG,"Yes, early in his career Arnold's acting was as stiff as a robot. Which makes this casting of Arnold as the terminator, a robot with a human flesh covering, perfect. Time travelling from the future to the past the terminator's mission is to kill Sarah Connor before she gives birth to a boy who will grow up to be the leader of the resistance to the machines. The only protection for this soon to be single mom is a human sent from the future as well.
The story itself was directly from a dream that James Cameron, director of True Lies, The Terminator, Terminator 2, and unfortunately Titanic, had and was able to recreate in this movie.
A good usage of a very low budget was what made this movie possible. The budget did affect special affects usage but the stop motion and models make up for most of it.
The Terminator is a classic action film but it does have a sub-plot that is interesting if you stop to think about it. Our reliance on computers and the continual strive to create something that has the possibility to destroy us, an idea that is stressed even more in Terminator 2.
Overall this is a movie that all action movie buffs have a responsibility to see and is a necessity to any DVD collection. It's a buy you won't regret.",1045785600,,1240,4.395652173913043

T2 like the first,starts off in the year 2029,where the Human Resistance and the machines of the future built by Skynet are still fighting. Again Skynet is trying to destory man's future by changing the past,but this time the target is not Sarah Conner(Linda Hamilton),but the future leader of the Human Resistance,her son John(Edward Furlong).Skynet as made a new terminator call the T-1000(Robert Patrick)to kill young John Conner. As before,the Resistance sends a protector for John,but this time it's the Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger)itself. Even though T2 is now 13 years old,it can still wow you with the stunning special effects that people still talk about years later. T2 is a great film to watch over and over again and is my fifth favourite film ever made. Alot of the images of T2 are really hard to forget,like the destruction of L.A. on Aug 29 1997. The DVD is one of best DVDs you can buy,loaded with special features like ""The Making Of T2"",""T2 More Than Meets The Eye""and ""The Making Of T2 3-D,teasers,trailers and what I think is awesome is you get two versions of T2,the original theatrical release or the special edition which you get the deleted scenes are put back in.

From a simple grainmill to a world spanning super computer, machines represent the pinaccle of humanity's technical capability. In the last sixty years the process of mechanization has reached such a point that life without PCs, e-mails and cellphones is consideraded impossible. Fiction and even some serious studies have brought up the frightning possibility that someday machines, as they become more advanced and complex will become inteligent and will revolt to anihillate us. Terminator is all about that. When you see the movie at first the story looks simplistic, if not absurd. But James Cameron hited the nail actually. The terryfing scenes of hordes of mechanized killers smashing burned human skulls and bones in their march to wipe mankind out is like a warning about the consequenses of the road we're taking. And the Terminator(Schwarzenegger) is the symbol of this future, a machine builded to kill, without hesitation or remorse. And who is Sarah Connor? A humble waitress that will become from one day to the other the hope of humanity. A woman living a regular life that doesn't even know what the future holds for her.

The bad guy in the previous is now the good guy fighting an even more powerful villian, T-1000 ), whose liquid-metal construction makes him seemingly unstoppable. The fate of the future lies in the balance, with Linda Hamilton reprising her role as the rugged woman whose son will change the course of history.

2136065,5,B0002WYTWG,"The ""Terminator"" made Arnold a superstar, James Cameron a hot product and a franchise going ito its third movie.  The visuals and special effects are a little crude, but Cameron injects a kinetic style that makes up for it.  The opening scene with the machines advancing on the humans still can send shivers down your spine.  The plot very complicated, brimming with mythic undertones and an epic sweep, but a Terminator, an advanced machine that is programmed to kill humans, is sent back in time to kill the mother of John Connor, the savior of mankind against the onslaught of the machines.  But a human soldier named Resse is sent back also to protect Sarah, the mother, tell her of the future and destroy the terminator.  Their cat and mouse chase is gripping, and Arnold is chillingly cold as the machine.  We also have superb action scenes, such as a car chase through a tunnel, the Terminator rampaging through a police station, and especially Resse's flashbacks to the future.
In many ways, the coldness of the ""Terminator"" is more haunting than the effects happy sequel (though they use them to optimum effect).  Also, Linda Hamilton is effective as Sarah, a usually timid LA girl who learns of her future, iconic like status.  The main flaw with the movie is the sometimes too profane dialouge.  The interplay in some scenes does not need a ...  every other line.  Though Arnold telling the motel manager .... is utterly hysterical.
This is one of the best action movies period.  The story is mythic, the acting well done and the direction top notch.  Even 20 years after its inception, this is still one of the premier action movies around.  Trat yourself to it.",1042156800,,1674,4.747404844290657
2136066,1,B0002WYTWG,"""I'll be back""
These words have never sounded so foul to human ears than when pronounced by Arnold Schwarzenegger (i deserve to get this posted for spelling it right) This is a bad remake of a bad film.
There are so many mistakes in the film:
 1)The T-1000 punches his body through the window of a helicopter to get inside. An instant later, the hole in the windshield is gone
2)The computer that the T-1000 reads in the police car (at the beginning) reads that John is 10 years old and was born on February of 1985. Which means that the movie would have to take place in 1995 ( 2 years before Judgement Day). Yet, Arnold claims in the car, (while driving towards Mexico) that Judgement Day would happen in 3 years, just after the Skynet funding bill is passed by congress
3)After The Terminator exists the bar in the beginning, and takes the gun from the 'bar owner' he takes his arm down from the barrel. Next scene his arm it is back in the original position on the barrel
4)In the bar fight scene Arnold gets stabbed by one of the bikers - if you put it in slow motion you see the rubber knife bend in a few frames.
And hasn't it become a cliche that all Mexicans have a US army supply store in the garden with a mustach  while drinking whiskey

They pulled it all off with this film. It is at times tense, funny and above all exciting. Before you see T3, be sure you see where it all began. T2 is great, but T1 is nothing short of astounding.",1041897600,,398,4.465753424657534
2136068,5,B0002WYTWG,"Just like the original ""Terminator,"" I can't imagine anyone reading this review, or looking at the Amazon entry and thinking about buying the film in it's ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD version, and not actually knowing what the film is about. The original ""Terminator"" became an icon; it entered our collective memories - ""I'll be back!"" - became a cultural phenomenon, a cinematic urban legend with a life all it's own, and ""T2"" is the next step in its evolution.
And `evolution' is a good way of looking at it. ""T2"" is not some cheesy installment in a bloated cinematic franchise, designed to generate mega-$'s for all concerned, while shortchanging the viewer with a bland or worthless story line, cardboard FX, and Z-list performances. No, ""T2"" is a legitimate continuation of the original ""Terminator,"" creating more of the backstory and mythology of the ""Terminator"" universe, and taking us closer to the day when Skynet achieves consciousness and decides to wage its war of global extermination against Mankind. In fact, the genesis of the ""T2"" story can be seen in one of the deleted scenes contained on the ""Terminator, Special Edition"" disc; Sarah Connor, tired of being hunted, decides to take the fight to Skynet's creator, the Cyberdyne Corporation, which, as shown in yet another deleted scene, is where the climactic fight against the original terminator took place!
And this, literally, is the key to ""T2."" When the original terminator was crushed in the press, the company salvaged its CPU/chip, damaged and inoperable, plus one arm. It's the research done on the CPU that leads to the computing breakthrough that leads to the creation of Skynet, which created the terminators in the first place! And just as Skynet sent a terminator back through time to ensure John Connor couldn't interfere with its plans, Sarah Connor attempts to stop the creation of Skynet itself in the present... you see where this is going? There're probably a couple of pretty nasty time-travel paradoxes involved in all of this - maybe we should ask Dr Who! - but it doesn't matter, the story carries you effortlessly along and doesn't let you start going `round and `round in those kinds of ever diminishing circles!
The basic set-up is as follows, having failed in killing Sarah Connor in the original ""Terminator,"" Skynet dispatches yet another terminator, a state of the art T-1000, this time to kill John Connor while he's a young teenager. And just as before, the adult John Connor dispatches a guardian, in the shape of an old T-800 terminator, reprogrammed to protect him at all costs.
And it's the difference between the two terminators that is one of the main joys of the film. The T-1000 is a shape-shifting ""liquid metal"" creation, able to morph into almost any guise it needs, as long as the end result is the same basic size, or volume, as itself. This basic characteristic is one of the elements that delayed the making of ""T2."" James Cameron had the idea for the ""shape shifter"" when making the original ""Terminator,"" but it took the intervening years for cinematic CGI FX to catch up with Cameron's imagination, so the T-1000 could be portrayed convincingly on-screen!
Robert Patrick plays the ""human"" T-1000, and his performance is as different from the original terminator as is the technology he represents. ""Ahnald's"" original performance set the standard, relentless and robotic, unstoppable, like a semi spinning out of control on an ice covered freeway; get out of the way or be obliterated. Robert Patrick gives a more subtle, more nuanced, performance; he's smaller, sleeker, faster, his is the relentlessness of a shark moving in for the kill, a thing of terrible beauty that cannot be swayed or negotiated with. But the T-1000 also knows something of human frailty, of pain, and how to use it to its advantage. Whereas the original terminator simply slaughtered anything that got in its way, the T-1000 actually tortures Sarah Connor in one scene in an effort to make her give up her son, telling her, ""I know this must hurt...""
""Ahnald's"" performance, as the old-tech T-800 model terminator, is also more varied, and this is explained in, what I think is, the most important scene deleted from the original theatrical release, but reinstated in this ""Ultimate Edition."" Sarah, having been broken out of an asylum by her son and his newest bestest buddy - his very own terminator! - is holed up in a disused gas station with John and the Terminator. The T-800 explains, while Sarah digs bullets out of its back, that it's possible for the terminators to learn, to adapt to their environments, but a switch on the CPU has to be reset to allow this behavior; the default setting is the unstoppable hunter killer, with no need of subtlety. But here's the catch, to make the change, which will allow the Terminator to better protect John, the CPU has to be removed, effectively shutting down the Terminator, then reset and reinstalled. The CPU is removed, but Sarah tries to destroy it, saying it'll be one less terminator, and John, exerting his authority for the first time, convinces his mother that they need the Terminator if they are to survive, and more importantly, stop the creation of Skynet. From here on in, the film roars to its finale as Sarah takes the fight to Cyberdyne by, literally, zeroing in on Dr Miles Dyson, the scientist who obsessively cracks the secret of the original terminator CPU.
""T2"" lacks the sheer visceral punch of the original; it's a more refined, mature, and carefully thought out film, but that's no criticism, the set pieces will blow you away, and the CGI, absolutely state of the art at the time, STILL stands up today. This is controlled action and mayhem for grown-ups, and ""Ahnald"" was true to his word when he said, ""I'll be back!""",1041638400,,5789,4.890132248219736

2136077,5,B0002WYTWG,"After the moderate success of The Terminator, James Cameron decided to outdo himself with the old ""bigger is better"" modus operandi, and together with the greatest special effects maestros in Hollywood, created one of the most amazing sci fi action thrillers ever! This time around, Schwarzenegger was to be the good guy and fans were less than happy with the idea. The Austrian oak who immortilised himself as the unstoppable killing machine who spoke the famous line: ""I'll be back!"" But movie geeks had little reason to worry, for Cameron had something better up his sleeve, with the T1000, an even more invincible killing machine who could take on Arnie's T100. The tantilising premise and top-notch talent behind the collosal project ensured boffo box office. And once again, Arnie (with shades for added coolness) proved that when it comes to blowing up things with really big guns, there is no substitute.
The action set-pieces are some of the most incredible ever put together, and with Stan Winston's lethal creation and ILM's morphing liguid metal guy (a menacing Patrick Stewart) battling it out for the future of mankind, the stakes are high, and the action ante even higher. A seriously buffed-up Linda Hamilton is a much stronger character than in the first film, and her hard-edged persona is well-played and fits the film's ""come and get it!"" tone. While the original's tense structure and nerve-shredding pace makes it superior in terms of cracking action, but in terms of spectacle and jaw-dropping SFX, T2 wins hands down. Wether this of the seminal original is the best is debatable, but what is for sure is that it is truly one awesome thrill ride packed with out-of-this world effects that still amaze 11 years later. Will the upcoming Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines be better? Only time will tell, but rest assured, T2 takes it deserved place in the collection of all-time greats and is a must-have on DVD.

Arnie is the quintessential killing machine on a mission to off Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) to prevent the birth of John Conner, the leader of the resistance against the future war of man against the machines.
The action is thrilling, heart-pounding stuff, with the Termintor on a mission to kill anyone who gets in the way.

Los Angeles, 1994. Sarah Connor has given birth to her son John, but due to the traumatic past, she's incarcerated in a mental hospital.
From the distant future, a highly advanced Terminator is sent to assassinate John. At the same time the human resistance also transports an older reprogrammed Terminator to protect John.
Unsuspecting, the young John and his guardian Terminator find themselves in a relentless struggle for survival.
What makes Terminator 2 such a landmark is it's special effects, which are simply out of this world. The seemingly indestructable killer cyborg, the T-1000, consists of liquid metal and mere words can't do it's beauty justice.
Spectacular, all the way through! The reason I don't rate this movie 5 stars is simply because I was still more impressed with the original. There are a few glaring contradictions in the time-traveling storyline, more apparent than in the original movie.  Also, this sequel lacks the sinister dark feeling that made it's predecessor so special.

2136083,4,B0002WYTWG,"This is a really cool movie. Even 11 years after it's release, the special effects still look convincing, and the story and acting is excellent (as long as you don't think too hard about the time travel). The story is that in the future, a self aware computer system called Skynet has ravaged the planet with a nuclear war, to wipe out the humans. However, a military resistance lead by strategic genius John Connor is mere inches from defeating Skynet, so the Machines, in a last-ditch effort send a Terminator, an unstopable Cyborg that looks like a Human to kill John Connor's mother, thus preventing his birth! However, John Connor lears of this, and sends a lone soldier named Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother. Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fall in love, thus concieving John Connor, and destroy the Terminator, with Kyle dying in the process. That is what is chronicled in the first Terminator.
In T2: Judgment Day, the machines devise an even better plan for wiping out John Connor. They send a more advanced terminator to the early 90's to kill John Connor himself while he is still a boy. The adult John Connor lears of this, and re-programs a Terminator to protect his child self in the past. Thus, the story for Terminator 2 unfolds.
The movie is awsome, but there is something VERY annoying about this film, and for that reason I will deduct a star from it. This movie could have EASILY been PG-13, had it not been for an over-abundance of foul language, and some ""un-artistic"" eye gouging scenes. If it haden't been for these two things, I'd say this would be a perfect film to show to the whole family. It's got a thought provoking story, and had it been milder in the language and more ""artistic"" in the eye gouging scenes, kids would be captivated by things like John Connor's frienship with his robotic protector. If you want to let your kids see it, I suggest that you see it yourself first, and fast forward through the eye gouging and one scene with alot of un-presidented profanity. However, there might be a bit too many ""F-Words"" scattered throught the film for it to be clean enough even so. Still though, for the more mature of us, this is a great film.

Years from now, Sarah will give birth to a son who is to lead the decimated human race to victory in their future war against the machines.

There's actual character development and emotion in this movie tied in with action and suspense.  I can't wait for the third one to come out!",1028764800,,692,4.333333333333333
2136088,5,B0002WYTWG,"First off I will say that the DVD itself is possibly the best DVD ever assembled, I mean there are so many special features I don't even know where to start.  Not to mention every special feature you will find yourself watching, including the three versions of the film itself, and at the price it is at right now, this is extremely essential.  Now onto the movie itself.  Arnold is back, only this time he's the good guy.  He's been re-programed and sent back in time to 1994 to protect a young John Connor (Edward Furlong in his film debut) from the new model Terminator, the liquid metal T-1000 (Robert Patrick, who is absolutely haunting).  While on the run from the T-1000, the pair rescue John's mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton, who has gone from would be victim to gung-ho heroine) who is incarcerated in a mental institution.  I remember seeing this film in the theater when it was released and I remember how awe inspired I was, and I still get that feeling when I watch it today.  The special effects were way ahead of the time, and they still hold up today.  While not as action packed as the original Terminator, Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi action epics ever made, and with this Ultimate Edition DVD, now has never been a better time to own it.",1028160000,,1264,4.465217391304348
2136089,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is the film that cemented director James Cameron as a visionary director, and also cemented Arnold Schwarzenegger as a premier action superstar.  Schwarzenegger is chillingly perfect as the heartless, soulless cyborg killer sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will unknowingly in the future give birth to a son named John who will become leader of a human resistance in a distant future war with cyborgs called Terminators.  Michael Biehn plays a soldier sent back in time as well to protect Sarah and stop the Terminator from fulfilling his mission.  Imaginitive special effects and makeup are abound, and the film is action packed from beginning to end, and all the actors give superb performances, but this is mainly Arnold's show, and like I said before he is chillingly perfect.  A little side note: Arnold was originally supposed to play the soldier sent to protect Sarah, and Lance Henriksen (who plays a cop) was supposed to be the Terminator, but Arnold expressed to Cameron that he would do better as the Terminator, and he was dead on the money.  Look for Bill Paxton as a punk in the beginning of the movie, he has an unfortunate run in with good 'ol Arnold.",1028160000,,1200,4.805825242718447

(Its only rival may be an unamed Lucas flick) The story is great, and it's now better with the directors uncut version. The Disc menu is very cool and exciting. Also, the directors commentary track is actually worth listening to through out the movie. The second disc is full of interesting behind the scenes stuff including almost every story board done for the film. I am re-energized for the upcoming T3 movie. Can he top Titanic? Hum . . .

2136091,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition DVD is a must have! You get three full versions of the movie, and there are over 80 chapters for this 2.5 hour epic! The theatrical version has everything you remember from seeing in the theater and on cable. The special edition gives you the same film with deleted scenes. And the extended version gives you the alternate ending, which was thankfully rejected by preview surveys. Not to say it's bad, but the ""open highway"" ending fits better with the overall themes of the film.
If there was any movie to be fanatical about, Terminator 2 is fantastic choice. And the Ultimate DVD offers a fanatic's dream. The featurettes and documentaries are numerous and detailed. Remember, with ""T2"" came out, brand new special effect techniques were being developed and implemented. Some folks had the right idea by documenting EVERYTHING in the process of making this ground-breaking film, it seems, and you have the privilege of viewing the behind-the-scenes secrets that elevated movie-making standards for the 90s.
This film thoroughly entertains with each viewing. A solid story, themes of fate, humanity, and morality ooze from the three main characters: the T-800 (Schwarzenegger), John Connor (Ed Furlong), and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Trying to make sense of the destiny the world is hurtling toward while battling the nearly invincible T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in some amazing and stylized action sequences, the trio cannot help but understand more about themselves and each other. Even though one is a machine, his CPU is ""a learning computer."" With a childlike innocence that is neither contrived or overplayed, The Terminator slowly learns what it means to be human while willfully protecting John and Sarah. He protects what he does not understand for much of the film. The unique dynamic between the three characters, a protective, empowered and courgeous mother, a young, but resourceful, streetwise child, and an unemotional learning machine, is well played.
There is something new to see each time, which will make the three versions with over 20 commentary tracks something worth revisiting time and time again. This is not just an action film, but the action alone could sustain someone not interested in the themes or philosophies behind it. Enjoy, you will not be diappointed.",1027641600,,2327,5.191489361702128
2136092,5,B0002WYTWG,"I have received this DVD today.  This is a really great movie!...  Anyway, I love this DVD",1027296000,,90,4.235294117647059
2136093,5,B0002WYTWG,"This movie was the overwhelmingly successful sequel to the original ""Terminator"" film that had established the series as well as the plausible context for this return to the science fiction genre and the notion of a world at risk at the hand of a murderous seemingly unstoppable cyborg. This time Schwarzenegger plays a cyborg sent back from the future and reprogrammed by Sarah Connor's son to save her and him (as a boy) from another, much more dangerous and technologically advanced cybernetic organism  (a T-1000 series) sent back to eliminate them all.  And so the incredible chase established in the first film resumes!
Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, this time much more savvy, cunning, and street-smart. Newcomer Edward Furlong plays her son, and Robert Patrick plays Schwarzenegger's indefatigable adversary, the quicksilver T-1000 cyborg.  A number of others from the original movie are also in this sequel, and the movie propels all of them on through another series of sequences and situations at a speed that is both breathtaking and awe-inspiring. There is also a lot of humor here, as Furlong's character comes to trust and even love the Schwarzenegger cyborg as it protects and helps him to free his mother and evade the T-1000. Some of the language is a bit blue, for Arnold learns from Furlong how to free-associate among a string of four-letter invectives in establishing a running commentary regarding the actions of his foes.
This is a superior thriller, and stands well against the test of time. Some of the special effects are absolutely spellbinding, and the film will easily hold your rapt attention throughout its more than two hour length. Rumor has it that Schwarzenegger and company have agreed to begin production on a new sequel, T-3, sometime in the near-term future. You will love this movie, and I can highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1027036800,,1881,5.041800643086817
2136094,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is likely one of the most widely screened movies of the last twenty years. In many ways its effects on popular consciousness have been notable, and it also made a major star of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who up to that point had appeared only in supporting roles in minor films like ""Stay Hungry"" with Jeff Bridges and ""The Villain"" with an aging Kirk Douglas.  With the release of this film, all that was over in a heartbeat. Or perhaps one could say, in the speed of a laser beam. For this is a science fiction thriller to end all thrillers!
The movie staggers the viewer with the horrifying vision of a world at risk, of a world we can recognize in the act of propelling itself toward a nightmare future, a future that may well be dominated by impersonal and anti-human machines. Linda Hamilton plays the hapless, disorganized, and playfully immature Sarah Connor, future legendary mother to John Connor, the future potential leader of the Anti-machine rebellion that might just save the world in that future time.  And while poor Sarah is trying to wrap her mind around all this data being hurled at her by a solitary soldier sent back in time through a time machine by her son to warn her, a cybernetic warrior is systematically hunting and killing every other Sarah Connor in the Los Angeles county telephone book!
This sets the stage for non-stop, heart-wrenching action, and the viewer is assaulted by both sights and data that intrigue and astound him or her, for this is science fiction very well done, a story that has meat and bones over its substantial interior, and like the cyborg that Arnold plays, is ready to slay you into submission.  The scenes don't follow each other so much as get exploded from one sequence to the next, in a blood-curdling, shotgun wielding struggle to kill or be killed. And the struggle goes on and on. This is a classic thriller, folks, one that has already spawned another hit movie (T-2), and rumor now has it that Schwarzenegger and company have T-3 ready to begin production soon. In the unlikely event you have been off the planet and have missed seeing it to date, no problem. Just grab this, some popcorn, and a box of Jujifruits.  The show is about to begin!",1027036800,,2221,4.658163265306122

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the character with great passion, giving the machine it's cold, merciless attitude. Stan Winston creates one of his early greats here, giving the machine a terrifying effect, and the stop-motion animation is an endoskeleton version of the great Jason And The Argonauts skeletons.
The Terminator has plenty of action and atmosphere to please, James Cameron handles it's style the way he handles his passion for filmmaking.

2136098,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2, is even more fun and action-packed than the first one. I was eight-years-old when this came out, and was extremely excited! Ofcourse the plot concerns two Terminators sent back to kill John Connor, son of Sarah.

For big T-Buffs, get the Ultimate Edition DVD, and watch the Special Edition which features tons of awesome scenes, which include Kyle Reese and some T-1000 special effects that are incredible!
The special effects are top-notch with Stan Winston returning aswell as ILM doing CGI work, that would later help make Jurassic Park the great film it is.

2136101,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator stands as one of the truly great movies ever made in my books. Like many people, I maintain a fluid list of favorite movies in my head, however, the top three spots have never changed. Star Wars: A New Hope is number one, Aliens is number two and the Terminator is number three. Everything else after that is in a constant state of flux as I see new films. James Cameron's opus will always be Aliens, but the Terminator is his second best work and his directorial debut. This film is exquisite start to finish and a masterpiece of contrasting imagery that spans forty years between the stark, rain swept night time streets of `present day' Los Angeles in 1984, and a dark, foreboding future where mankind clings to life in a terrific struggle against the machines.
The film opens in Los Angeles of 2029. Silvery aerial and tracked hunter-killer tanks roll relentlessly across field of shattered human skulls, searching for pockets of humanity to exterminate. The whine of engines and the purple flash and deep resonant pulse of the plasma cannons highlight a grey, dead city. It sets the stage for the war of the future that will be fought in the present as Skynet, the intelligence created by Cybderdyne Systems, sends a lone cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton), mother of John Conner, who will teach the humans to organize and fight back. It is implied that the humans capture the facility, are able to send a protector to look after her, and make it possible for John to be born. An interesting problem exists in that all the records of Sarah Conner's existence are gone, the Terminator only knew her name and the city in which she lives. Thinking logically, it stars a methodical search using the phone book, and begins killing every Sarah Conner it can find.
Part of what makes this movie so perfect is the lead heroine. Nowadays strong female characters, the Mara Jade types, are usually confrontation, arrogant, and mean. Sarah Conner, like Aliens' Ellen Ripley, is a wonderful mix of very attractive qualities. She is thoughtful, intelligent, and possessing of an inner strength that even she doesn't believe she has within her. But at the same time she is depicted as lonely, which leads to a great sense of isolation when she realizes that she is next on the killer's list. And when she is at her most helpless, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) saves her, but not only that. He acts as a spring board for her character to begin delving within to find what she needs to help herself and learn what she must teach her son if he is to be the savior of mankind. The dynamic between Hamilton and Biehn is electric. There is real passion there, because in many ways they are the same person, just reversed. Kyle is a warrior, with a sensitive caring soul held just beneath the surface that Sarah brings to the surface.
The action and pacing of the film are first rate as three points converge: The Terminator, Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner, moving towards a flash point and the climax of the film. The Terminator is methodical- procuring weapons, a place to hide, and locating the Sarahs. Kyle is more in the background, but doing essentially the same thing, except he has a picture of Sarah. Conner's only inkling that something is wrong happens when she learns that women with her name are being killed all over LA. And when Sarah is stood up by her date, she opts to go see a movie instead when she realizes that someone is following her. After killing Sarah's roommate and her boyfriend at their apartment, the terminator overhears Sarah calling Ginger for help, revealing her location.  The three points converge is a trendy night club. It's an epochal event as the Terminator finally comes face to face with her. Then with all the aplomb of a man hailing a cab, he singles her out with his laser-sighted .45 and prepares to change history.
There follows a series of high speed chases through the streets of LA, and Cameron's telltale style of lighting, often glaring white, shining from the background adds an almost otherworldly effect to mundane things like buildings and cars. When Sarah and Kyle are arrested, the Terminator goes through an entire police station to get her, including Millenium's Lance Henriksen. Escaping into the night, the two prepare for the final confrontation with the mechanized killer. Kyle teaches Sarah how to make pipe bombs while telling her of his world. And he explains why he volunteered to be the one to come back in time. It is in fact Kyle who is John's father, and I'm sure there has to be a temporal paradox in there somewhere.
Visually, the film is first rate. Fantasy II's future sequences and Stan Winston's make-up and Terminator endo-skeletons are some of the finest moments in Science Fiction film making. Even in this day and age of CG-everything, the rear projected, stop motion animated Terminator effects are still very good, standing up well in the light of eighteen years of technological innovation. Additionally, for the special edition DVD they redid some of the sound effects, like the Terminator's long-slide .45. There are lots of extras, including deleted scenes, still galleries, and two interview reels with Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron, plus Biehn and Hamilton. After eighteen years since I first saw it, Terminator is still Number 3 on my list of favorite films, and it always will be.",1026518400,,5423,4.781449893390192
2136102,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is just the best ever.  T2 is one of the few movies I saw as a child (teenager actually) that still blows me away as an adult.  All the characters were cool and worked together well.  I loved watching the relationship between John and the Terminator grow into a solid friendship.  It was also cool watching Sarah overcome her prejudices against the Terminator and realize that he's really not the same as the one that tried to kill her 10 years earlier.  That liquid metal T-1000 was just about unstoppable and was pretty scary.
I remember being quite shaken by the scenes of the burning playground at the beginning of the film and by the nuclear holocaust scene.  They were very vivid and kinda frightening (I was only 13, remember).
As for the DVD itself, it has the clearest and best picture I've ever seen (there's really something to that THX stuff).  I love the DTS 5.1 sound.  It really seems like you're in a movie theater.
My fave version of the movie is still the theatrical version.  The 2 extended versions are overlong and none of the added footage is really necessary.  However the parts where the T-1000 are malfunctioning in the steel mill and melting into the floor could've been left in to show that he was starting to lose ground.
Also (pet peeve) the movie says John was 10 (in the police computer readout), but this is a mistake.  In the first movie Sarah was 6 months pregnant with John in November 84 and then gave birth to him February 85.  The 2nd movie is set in the summer of 94 (because the Terminator told John that his future self reprograms him 35 years from that time; 1994 + 35 = 2029).  Therefore John is only 9 and will be 10 in February 95, but that's just a small pet peeve.  Overall, it's the best DVD ever.",1026432000,,1750,4.411214953271028

2136104,5,B0002WYTWG,"Well, Arnold's film Terminator 2 still manages to amaze! 10 years after its theatrical release, the film's ultimate edition DVD is more amazing than the movie. It is hands down, the best DVD a person can own.  For starters, the case comes in a metalic shield, which is a cool bit decoation.  But the real beauty lies in the content of the disc.  For starters, a movie like this really capitalizes the full potential of DVDs. Its crisp sound and sharp image give the film more depth and you appreciate it on a different level. Films that are great because of their great writing and acting aren't really enhanced by DVD...seeing Humphrey say ""All the bars in this world"" is not more interesting on DVD...but Terminator 2...WOW!

The real meat and potatoes of this DVD, however, lie in the extra material you get. For starters, the menus are absolutely amazing! They are almost mini-scenes that are completely new, but are so sharp, they could have been used in the movie.  All the documentaries are great and let you appreciate the amount of work, time, and energy that went into the film.  Its always fun to hear about the film from Cameron and Arnold themselves.  These featurettes aren't 2 to 6 minutes either.  They have a lot of content and are very interesting.
You are also given the choice of seeing the movie WITH ITS DELETED SCENES placed in! Theres even an alternate ending.  Its a great DVD and has, so far, been unsurpassed for its content and presentation.  This is the paramount of my or anyone's DVD collection.  A must have!",1025827200,,1540,4.645756457564576
2136105,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator is one of those movies I remember long after I walked out the theatre. What I remembered most was that it was pretty darn scary. A good thriller type of film to watch on the TV or Theatre. The effects were very cool at the time and the robot and mechanical effects were pretty impressive.
Of course James Cameron and Arnold Swartzeneger had a chance, with more time, money and technology, to do the second Terminator much bigger, better, faster and louder - but this one had a simple story and motivated the characters to really move.
Linda Hamilton and Michael Bein were great together and the action very intense. Ironically enough The Terminator is a bad guy in this movie. He spends most of his time trying to kill Linda. In the sequel, he is just the opposite - trying to save Linda and her son. It's irony with a twist.
This is good science fiction, with good action and some very scary scenes; I purchased this DVD, which does not have all the extras. Since then, the new DVD has a lot more. Oh and Terminator 3 will be out in 2003 - if you didn't already know!",1025568000,,1079,4.373134328358209

2136111,5,B0002WYTWG,James Cameron's Classic Masterpiece T2 is a brillent film achievment that could never be done over. This film has great depth more than what people think. This is not just an action picture but a great drama to. This movie came out on a incridable 2 disk DVD Which has three version's of the film. The best version of the film is a version with 20 minutes of extra footage put back into the movie. Instead of the movie being 139 minutes long its 159 minutes long. These extra minutes add more to the depth of the story and more to the charcter's devolpment. This is so much more than an action movie when you watch it think harder and enjoy the movie exsperince its a lot batter than just scraching the surface of the story. James Cameron's has made one of the best film's of all time. And the DVD makes the exsperince even better. The footage added to the movie gives so much more depth that you don't even need to see the first Terminator because it gives you so much it pretty much tells you what happend in the first one. I like the first one but there is no need for anybody too see the first one again because this super delux version of T2 exsplian's enough about the first Terminator so you don't half to watch the first one to refresh your memory. If you have never seen the first Terminator than you will half to watch the first one but for those of you who have seen it you don't need to go back and watch it unless you want to.,1024012800,,1439,4.1985559566787005

2136113,5,B0002WYTWG,"I was fortunate enough to see a new digital print of this film with a new Dolby soundtrack. The new sound rocks and is a major improvement over the Mono from before.
I'm not a big fan of Cameron as a director though. There are no huge comparisons between the terrifying Dark Future LA and the 1984 LA. As most scenes are shot at night in derelict parts of town the whole films looks miserable. It can also be so VERY, VERY 80's. Take a gander at the clothing and the music. The Technoir scene is a great example.
Arnie is super-cool as the emotionless cyborg who just blows everyone away WITHOUT grinning at the camera. Michael Beihn makes for a good hero and Linda Hamilton is just as good as Sarah Connor. But she became really annoying in the sequel. It's a shame Lance Henrikson isn't in it for long and Dick Miller has an amusing cameo.
It is quite scary in parts too. The steel exo-skeleton of the Terminator is not the kind of bad guy I'd wanna go up against and the visions of the robot war is rather ugly. Especially when we see the wheel crush up all the human skulls. Although it is quite unlikely that skulls would be piled up like that. Where are the rest of the bones?
The Terminator theme is very cool but the rest of Brad Fiedel's score is absolutely terrible. It's nothing but inaudible noise. The same applies for T2 and his score for True Lies. Has anyone apart from Cameron ever employed him?
Most of today's sci-fi is junk and quickly forgettable (Fifth Element, X-Men) but this has stood the test of time and will do for a long time to come, regardless of the 80's feel to it.
But Cameron made it in 1.85:1, which sucks. The second film, while not an improvement, is up to the same standard. See the new version of this movie if you can it's a great improvement over the older print.

Almost seven years have passed since the first film and it's the fight to keep young John Connor alive. The T-800 (Schwarzenegger) and a new terminator made of goo, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) go back to fight over little John Connor. Machines have never been so cool! Arnold Schwarzenegger gives the performance of his career and it's the best thing that ever happened to me! He wears leather, has the cool sunglasses and motorcycle, truly vast! The T-800 is programmed to protect the boy to ensure the future doesn't change and the liquid thing is programmed to terminate the boy. A fight to remember forever! Both machines are unstoppable, but the liquid has the advantage. Not fair! Arnold's fist just goes right through the gooey mess and it doesn't work. It was distraught that Arnold could not stop the mean machine no matter what he tried. James Cameron is the King of the World, not for ""Titanic"" but for this mesmerizing piece of genius.

Well, in 1984, a man named Kyle Reese and a terminator were sent to kill the mother of the rebel leader of the future. Sarah Connor supposedly gives birth to the leader of human resistance to the machines and his name is John Connor. The man was sent to protect her and the machine was sent to  change the course of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the ultimate mechanism that has no feeling and no heart! How frosty! It's the fight of a lifetime between the man and the machine, but unfortunately, the man loses. After many deaths fulfilled by the terminator, Sarah Connor crushes it. I was so perturbed with the extermination of Arnold, I turned it off right then. Arnold should never die in a movie.

Though the FX weren't exactly innovative even in 1984, they're good enough to make the futuristic sets and high-octane action scenes more than believable.  But James Cameron's story of heartless cyborg murderers and an expendable humanity isn't built on FX pyrotechnics anyway, and that's why in many ways it compares favorably to its generally bigger and better sequel, Judgment Day.  Cameron and co-scripter/producer Gale Anne Hurd created a story around a skeleton of realistic characters and some clever twists on the traditional time travel plot, which Cameron himself then molded into a masterpiece of cinematic suspense.  Highlights include:  a peak ahead to an apocalyptic future where humans live like rats and cybernetic assassins stalk the earth; a sensitive love scene between the mother-to-be of mankind's eventual savior and her protector; much clever dialogue (""Come with me if you want to live,"" ""I'll be back,"" etc.), and a closing shot that turns the traditional riding off into the sunset ending on its head as the female lead drives off down an uncertain road beneath hovering thunderclouds that are harbingers of the nuclear storm to come.

At first you think that this is suppose to be the final battle of man vs. machine and that the terminator was sent there to kill Sarah and Kyle was sent there to protect her, but as in every true time travel paradox movie there is a second meaning to the film...
The Terminator's arrival to the present is what created SKYNET and Kyle Reese's arrival to the present is what gave life to John Connor.  So in reality this is not the final battle for mankind, this is the battle that started it all... cool huh...

Part thriller, part romance, part time travel paradox, The Terminator was a blast when it first came out and is just as much fun to watch now.
This DVD edition is terrific. You can listen or watch subtitles in English, French or Spanish. Special features include: trailers -- two from television, two for US theaters and one for foreign theaters; two documentaries -- an 18 minute retrospective with James Cameron (JC) and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the new one-hour ""Other Voices"" featuring cast and crew recollections; 5 deleted scenes and 2 deleted arcs, with JC commentary; a treatment, the fourth draft and the final draft of the script; and a photo gallery of JC's artwork, production stills, Stan Winston effects, special effects, and publicity materials.  There is a lot to see here and it is all interesting.

There are some fascinating revelations here -- for instance, originally conceiving of The Terminator as an everyman who could be inconspicuous anywhere, Arnold was originally interviewed for the part of Kyle Reese and OJ Simpson was being considered for The Terminator!  Yikes.

Lovely package.

2136125,4,B0002WYTWG,"I was kinda miffed when I discovered that 'The Terminator' Special Edition DVD was released in the UK before it was available state-side. You'd think that the first video release of a movie would occur in the country it was made in, right? After all, how would the British digital videophile feel if 'Monty Python' was available on DVD in the US before being released in the UK? Or a Japanese disc-hound if he discovered the 'Akira' Special Edition platter was gonna first hit the street in Toronto instead of Osaka? But, since MGM is a gigantic multinational corporation, and they own the rights to (or have a license to distribute) 'The Terminator' Special Edition DVD, I guess they can release it anywhere and at any time they danged well feel like it. Which is pretty much what they did of course. Fortunately, I still had the original Terminator DVD to tide me over 'til the new platter's release date rolled around.
However, after checkin' out this bad boy, my little gripe concerning MGM's distribution practices kinda fell by the wayside. Though not nearly as tricked out as the Special Edition DVD release of T2, this disc does have a pretty good array of extras, including trailers, cut scenes, two documentaries, and even a choice between listening to the new 5.1 sound remix or the original mono! I found this little bonus to be the disc's most interesting feature. Since I'd watched the old mono 'Terminator' many many times, I was really able to hear the difference between the two sound tracks, especially when gunshots were being fired. Just do a quick back & forth switch between the 5.1 and the mono during the police station shootout, and you'll see-- whoops, I mean hear-- what I'm talking about!
I was somewhat disappointed that the cut scenes were put aside for separate viewing on the Special Features side, rather than restored to the movie itself. But, when I listened to Cameron's audio commentary regarding these moments, he made a few fairly good reasons why he decided not to make the restoration. Still, I think it would've been a neat idea to have the option of watching the theatrical version and the rendition with these cutting-room bits restored. There's a few more poignant moments with Reese and Sarah, but most of the clipped moments involved Cyberdyne, the company that eventually paves the way for the Terminator's future. I'll not reveal any further info regarding these 'lost' scenes; you'll have to see them for yourself!
Then there's the documentaries. The first one is a half-hour retrospective featuring (for the most part) Arnie and Cameron discussing their memories about the making of 'The Terminator'. Then there's the 'Other Voices' doc, featuring remembrances by such notables as director-cowriter James Cameron, makeup effects designer Stan Winston, T2 co-writer William Wisher, producer Gale Ann Hurd, Arnie, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and other people involved in the making of this legendary sci-fi actioner.
The one extra feature I was hoping would be on this disc is, unfortunately, absent: a feature-length commentary track by Cameron. I found this little exclusion to be a bit disappointing. I guess I'll just have to deal with it whilst I continue my 'Easter Egg' hunt. However, If you have a DVD-Rom in your computer, this platter also includes three different drafts of the script, as well as watch the movie whilst reading the final draft screenplay. You know, just in case you can't follow the dialogue too well, and you're not too hot about reading those pesky English subtitles.

2136126,4,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron's follow-up to its lower-budgeted predecessor, ""Terminator 2:  Judgment Day"" features a pumped-up Linda Hamilton teamed up with a reprogrammed Arnold Schwarzenegger to protect Edward Furlong as an LA bad boy who will one day save the future.  Whoa... time travel movies make me dizzy.

Yep, this time, Arnold's the good guy.  He's still a steel-skeletoned leather-jacketed mesomorph from the future, only now, he has a soft and cuddly side.  It's uber-mom Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, who muscles her way through the action.  She starts the film in the nut-hatch, where she's like a chick Hannibal Lecter with a benign agenda, but the same results.  And no wonder she's so violent:  this time, she's got to battle the freaky liquid metal T-1000 (Robert Patrick as the worst cop ever!).  T-1000 wants to cut Furlong's puberty short either to spare us endless reports of his future misdeeds on ""Entertainment Tonight,"" or to prevent him from destroying the crazed supercomputer that tried to wipe out the world.  Either way, it's up to the good guys to keep the kid alive.

Cameron mixes characterizations as sharp as the glass that explodes all over this movie with some knock-out violence and stunt sequences, plus some shocking-for-its-time CGI work into a sci-fi action fest with a steel fist and a tender heart.  Say what you want about Arnold- he's got chemistry with Furlong.  Yeah, the big guy works well with kids.  And Hamilton is full of a mother's love; she just expresses it by stabbing people and shooting them.  As for ""T2"" itself, it's super-slick, gun metal blue, goes off like a rocket and never lets up.  Pure entertainment at its finest.

If you enjoyed the movie, you'll definitely want the ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD, because it's got more features than the T-1000 has transformations.  Commentary, deleted footage, the trailers, the screenplay.  Storyboards.  A collector's booklet.  And the movie itself in a sweet widescreen transfer.  I can't go on... I'm exhausted.

Which is how you'll feel after watching ""T2.""  But in a good way, like a day at an amusement park.  This is one flick that proves big, loud action movies don't have to skimp on the smarts or the love.",1017619200,,2200,4.945355191256831

The first in this two-series movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Terminator from the future which has come to terminate Sarah Connor, because she later gives birth to John Connor who would lead a mission against evil machines like terminators.  Sarah knows nothing about it until she sees a news flash which informs her of the murders of three people with similiar names: Sarah Connor.

In the future, John sends back his best friend to protect his mom, and he becomes John's father.  Now, another Arnold bot is sent back, along with Robert Patrick.

Everyone I know seems to like T2 better than the original, but I still stand firm. With the obvious exception of special effects, The Terminator is far superior to the sequel in every way, and remains James Cameron's masterpiece. Way back in 1984 he turned an action-science fiction flick into a violent, depressing, totally compelling work of art! The writing, direction, and acting are all outstanding, with a sense of style being maintained throughout the entire experience. And, unlike in the sequel, Arnold is believeable as a murderous cyborg, that will do anything to complete its objective. The action sequences are truly brilliant with slow motion, foreboding music, and razor sharp editing all combining to create an original and brutal benchmark for both action and science fiction films! Well, in my opinion, anyway. Seriously, though, what happened Mr. Cameron!? From raising the bar with awesome films like The Terminator and Aliens in the mid 80s, to turning out meaningless garbage like True Lies and Titanic a decade later!! I thought you could only get better with time! I guess I was wrong...

But the picture is perfect, and the 5.1 surround just RIPS and puts you right in the middle of the action. Many DVD's make rather dissappointing use of surround sound. They need to give this a listen to see how it should be done. My only gripe is the lack of separate French and Spanish language tracks,so I still have the rugular version of the T2 DVD. Languge students take note,DVD's are a great (someimes VERY frustrating) tool for the intemediate student on up,though I'm sure many have discoverd that by now.(And those dreadful Pokmon cartoons are much more tolerable with an alternat language track).

Everybody suspected a sequel, and so it came, in the form of Terminator 2:Judgement Day, a bigger, better, more action packed sequel.
 John Connor has now been born and is now about 13 years old. Now he is the target for the brand new T-1000, a liquid metal killing machine whose mission is to destroy him and ultimately ending the future of the machines in which he is the leader.
But like in the first film, the future resistance is able to send back a terminator aswell, but to protect young John.
 The good terminator[played by arnold] finds John first, and they both go on the run from the T-1000, in which Arnold is no match. Which follows is a sequence of events that keeps you on the edge of your seat with awsome special effects and some truly amazing stunts. Of course this is a James Cameron picture, no surprise.

T2: Ultimate Edition is exactly that. This is the absolute perfect release that fans of this fantastic movie have been waiting for. I'm pretty sure the extra features on this disc reach near four hours, and all of it is interesting.
The best thing about the disc is that you can watch the movie in two very distinct (and one rather similiar) ways.  The first choice is to watch the DVD without the deleted scenes reinserted. This is okay for purists who liked the original cut, but it [stinks] in my opinion.  The deleted scenes are all integral in understanding what the original version of the movie was supposed to be.  There are quite a few brilliant scenes that will have you angered when you realize how good they are.

2136143,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is thrilling, edge-of-your seat entertainment, but it not so subtly begs the examination of man's quest to create the perfect machine only to have his creation turn against him. This is expanded upon in T2 but the original appeals to me more because the viewer has to do the thinking. The icons and imagery are all there, but it doesn't detract from the action and suspensful aspects of the film. Don't misunderstand me; the sequel was great. Cameron had less to work with here and success was not assured. As for the presentation of the DVD, I can say that it's impressive. I remember the film being dark and grainy. The colours are rich and warm, considering much of the movie is at night. The deleted scenes are a bonus. I can see why they were left out, though upon viewing them they add much depth to the story. This is the only sci-fi movie I'd recommend to those who normally would not venture into the genre.

2136144,5,B0002WYTWG,"I've never traditionally been drawn to science fiction and ""techno-thriller"" films. One notable exception to my lukewarm attitude toward science fiction films is a 1984 James Cameron film that I consider to be one of the very best of its genre. ""The Terminator,"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn, is a very, VERY good film indeed!

Before this week, I had pretty much forgotten just how good ""The Terminator"" is. I had seen it in the theater in 1984, and perhaps two other times on VHS in the years that followed. I was re-introduced to the film recently when I received in the mail my latest order from Amazon.com: a ""Special Edition"" copy of ""The Terminator"" on DVD.

This film is just as good now as it was seventeen years ago! It has lost none of its intensity, none of its non-stop, heart-pounding excitement, none of its originality. Recently, as I watched ""The Terminator"" for the first time in perhaps ten years, I found myself once again transported to the dark world created by director/screen writer James Cameron, and brought to life by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Biehn.

Five minutes into ""The Terminator"" (counting the opening credits), and the screen literally explodes with action and excitement as the Terminator relentlessly hunts his prey, catches up with her, and finds himself coming face to face with her protector. Watch the spine-tingling, non-stop action as our protagonists constantly try to elude their predatory robotic nemesis, and the Los Angeles Police Department gamely tries to figure out just whatintheheck is going on here anyway?!?

 The acting in ""The Terminator"" is actually pretty good. Certainly not Oscar-contending material, but definitely of a lot higher caliber than I expected the first time I saw the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his first role of real substance (and the role that made him a box-office star) proves that, yes indeed, he really can act.

Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor. Her evolution from a cute, all-American girl, to a victim of a seemingly random crime, to a disbelieving participant in a battle through time, to a woman of substance with a tortured soul and highly developed sense of responsibility, is gradual but quite noticeable, and an excellent acting achievement.

Michael Biehn is also very good in his role as Kyle Reese. He delivers his lines powerfully and demonstrates a wide spectrum of on-screen emotions. Like Schwarzenegger, he possesses tremendous physical acting ability.

""The Terminator"" conveys a certain ""film noir-ish"" feel that greatly adds to the film's overall suspensefulness, tension, and excitement. By design, most of ""The Terminator"" was filmed at night. The result: a dark, almost sinister atmosphere prevails.

Although it's seventeen years old now (as of this writing),  ""The Terminator"" remains an  intense, exciting film, imbued with a highly original story line, excellent special effects (at least for its day), and pretty darn good acting to boot.  A ""must own"" DVD for ""sci-fi"" and Schwarzenegger fans alike!",1013644800,,3067,5.198782961460446
2136145,5,B0002WYTWG,"This classic piece of science fiction is one of James Cameron's best works, and better than its sequel, excellent though that is.  It begins in the future, with machines ruling the Earth, before backtracking to present day.  It turns out that the machines have sent back a cyborg in the shape of Arnie to kill the mother (Hamilton) of what will be the leader of a human war against the machines.  Yet the humans send back a human protector for the unaware Sarah O'Connor called Kyle.  Thus ensues one of the most compelling chase movies for a long time, with a dark plot that adds to a sense of despair and panic.
The acting is all spot on, with Hamilton being especially impressive as the ditzy waitress who suddenly has to come to terms with the fact that she holds the key to humanity's existence.  Surprisingly Arnie is also incredibly well suited to the menacing role of the terminator - the role that launched him into super stardom.  The action sets are all superb too, with some great special effects even by today's standards.  All this and there are some fantastic one-liners, some of which have deservedly gone down in movie history.  However, it is the dark nature of the story that really gives it the nudge above countless other such movies.  The city streets that the heroine runs through look wasted enough for the audience to consider if it's worth saving or not.  That the movie manages to tackle a romantic subplot successfully should also be noted.  This is one of those rare movies where looking back, it is still the genre classic now as it was then.",1013558400,,1572,4.598566308243727

2136147,4,B0002WYTWG,"I loved this movie came out.  At the time, there was very little CGI, if any, in movies of the time.  The models looked a little cheesey, but not too bad.  Seeing this now, the models look almost comical.  The action is still great, but the advances in movie making really come to mind.",1012867200,,286,4.2407407407407405
2136148,5,B0002WYTWG,"I was born in 1974, so I'm now old enough to remember two entire decades - the 80s and 90s.  Compared to the somehow-hopeful, PC 1990s, it's amazing to see how dark, terrfying, and graphic many mainstream 1980s movies were.  The Terminator embodies many qualities of such dark movies, and serves as a historical social record for the paranoid, technophobic, cold-war 80s.

It's also an awesome, balls-to-the-wall sci-fi film that pretty much set the standard for action movies.

First off, this movie wouldn't have been half of what it was without Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Holy #$&8! this guy embodies the movie concept - an unstoppable killing machine, who, in the words of frail human protector Kyle Reese, ""Can't be reasoned with, can't be bargained with, and absolutely will not stop, until you are dead!""

Death, destiny or doom, love, and courage are all themes wrapped into this outstanding movie, which refuses to be dated or made obsolete even in the face of advanced computer CGI that flood movies made these days.  They used stop-action animation in this movie, but it still looks good even 18 years later.  And though you can tell it's animation, you don't care, which is powerful proof that story drives a movie, not FX.

Five stars all around.  And the DVD Dolby soundtrack is outstanding, too.

2136149,5,B0002WYTWG,"SUPURB!! I have always loved the film but you get so much more from this Special Edition DVD.
You get the film on one disc, and it has a lot more scenes in it that had been cut out for the original release. On the other disc, you have the making of the film as well as the making of the Terminator 2 3-D at Universal Studios, which was great. I have just been to Universal Studios in Florida & T2 3-D was AMAZING! This DVD is very worth Buying.",1012089600,,444,3.9444444444444446
2136160,4,B0002WYTWG,"Sure, Terminator 2 might be more technologically advanced than the first one as well as longer and has more action but for some reason the first one catches my eye more and seduces me more. The 2nd one starts 10 years after the first terminator came back to kill Sarah Conner but failed, the 2nd terminator was sent to kill John when he was only ten years old, however this was a T-1000, an advanced Terminator that can copy and imitate anything it touches. As in the first a protector is sent, the T-800, the same model as the first terminator who is kinder and gentler in this movie.  The reason the first terminator is better is because the humans don't stand a chance against the Terminator, it's a cyborg and they can't kill it, two Terminators fighting each other gives away the ending of the 2nd movie.  the sound mix is alright but the way the widescreen picture is set up isn't as amazing as the first terminator movie.  I was kinda left disappointed but I did enjoy the movie a great deal, but today it's not as amazing, it's just too serious and tries to be better than the first movie, most sequels don't try to surpass the original but extend the story.  But anyways, the picture quality is good and the sound mix isn't too shabby, the DVD menu is kind of hard to navigate through and the documentaries are more about interviews but not actually shooting scenes and how they came about or what they used to make them. Why I give this DVD 4 stars is the fact that it's the terminator and was also one of the first rated r movies I ever watched and to this day still makes me guilty because I know I should have not watched it because I wasn't supposed to, oh well, can't change the past can you?",1011830400,,1707,4.325
2136161,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator, while fun, has never really been held up as a great film. Certainly it was notable for the never ending climaxs that seem to keep coming. But it is most notable for pushing Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still, the crisp, clean sound and video are great, and show how a scene contained a real mixture of the two. For me, the deleted scenes were the big draw - showing what was shot but not used. Watch it once to enjoy the scenes (or scene snippets), and then watch it with the commentary track and find out why it was not used. Some of the reasons you may agree with, but some you may not. I suppose it is extras like this that make owning the DVD worthwhile.",1011657600,,683,4.3023255813953485
2136162,5,B0002WYTWG,"This was a great movie. This in my opinion was WAY better than the first. Plus in this one Arnold was acting better. If you think oh its the same plot, your wrong. Arnold Schwarzenegger play the good guy this time and he talks more. Robert Patric plays the bad guy. The plot is the movie starts out 2029. The voice of Linda Hamelton explains whats going on. Her son was born and stuff. I do not want to go through it so I wont. Its good. Just buy it.",1011398400,,450,4.011111111111111
2136163,4,B0002WYTWG,"Well I doubt I need to paraphrase the plot, so I won't.  But what i will do is discuss the DVD, which most of the time the only info I really want to know.
OK, first of all the picture quality is EXCELLENT.  In fact, it's so good that it looks as if it were filmed just yesterday.  (Except for the occasional Gremlin you see in the film, LOL!)  But anyway, the DVD case states that it was transfered from a HD master and it shows.
However the new 5.1 soundtrack is not bad, but you can tell that it's all new as to everything hasn't been ""stereo-ized"".  For example, in the police station scene where Arnold is walking through and shooting everybody he sees his guns, there are instances when the gun sounds are in stereo in one shot and then not in another while in both instances they should be as they fire to the left or right.  Also the sound is really bad during the film's numerous car chases where the most dominant sound is the music while the car sounds are barely audible and then all of a sudden you get a sound in the left or right channel when the car hits something or makes a powerslide around a corner.  But...what can you expect from a soundtrack that was originally just Monoaral.
One note though, since I don't have a true surround sound system, that above complaint may not be as bad as I made it out to be.  (I have a TV with simulated surround and a 2 speaker stereo that has SRS sound)
But as for the Bonus Features, that's where you get your money's worth.  First of all it has several deleted scenes w/ or w/o commentary, all of which are in as good as shape visually as the Feature.  Second of all it comes with 2 really great documentaries.  ""The Terminator: A Retrospective"" that was shot in '92 (a year after T2) that's OK, but not too indepth, and ""Other Voices"" that is brand new that really goes into the making of the film that mirrors in quality the documentary that's on the T2: Ultimate Edition.
The Menu Navigation is also very cool which sort of takes you through several ""Cyberdyne"" animations.
So if you're looking to complete your Terminator DVD collection as I did after already owning T2, grab this one as it's the best version we'll have for a while, or forever.
Oh, one more thing about the sound.  They have changed the sound of the Flying HKs.  They no longer have that strange screaming robotic sound.  They now have a jetliner sound, which may or maynot sound more realistic to you.  In fact all of the Future War sequences have been totally revamped sonically.",1011225600,,2511,4.358369098712446
2136164,5,B0002WYTWG,"The original ""Terminator"" is arguably the greatest sci-fi/action film ever, and the Special Edition DVD finally does this classic film justice. Many people look at the sequel as the better of the two, but remember, Cameron was given a huge budget for T2. He was forced to film ""The Terminator"" for less than $6 million. If you're like me, you could write enough about this movie to fill an encyclopedia, but I'll try to give just a breif plot description for those who have yet to see it.
In the future, SkyNET, the supercomputer in control of all military power, decides that humans must be destroyed and begins a massive nuclear war that destroys most of the population. The survivors form a resistance agains the computer and its mechanical army, and eventually defeat it, thanks to their leader John Connor. In a final effort to win, the computer sends a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, before he is born. The humans send back a lone soilder, Kyle Reese, to protect Sarah from the seemingly unstoppable cyborg.
When the movie was originally filmed, the soundtrack was recorded in mono, which sounded horrible on the original DVD release of the Terminator. But here you can find a newly recorded soundtrack, with the original soundtrack remixed along with new gun and explosion sound effects. Most of the new sounds are very cool (esp. the HK entrance in the first scene), and the new gun effects are good for the most part. Only in a few instances are the new sounds a little weak. Fortunately the DVD also sports the original mono soundtrack for when you want to watch the original verion.
Next to the film itself, the best part of this DVD is the Special Features, most of which were unavailable before. There are two Terminator documentaries, which have cast and crew interviews and behind the scene footage of the original filming of the Terminator, very cool stuff for die hards. Also featured are deleted scenes from the original film, which offer a deeper look into the Terminator mythology, and shows different sides of some characters which you wouldn't see in the original. Also in the special features are all the original storyboards for the film and hundreds more photos of the sets, actors and sketches from the original production. Simply put, for die hard Terminator fans, your wait is over. Terminator: Special Edition is a godsend.
HERE ARE ALSO TWO SECRETS I HAVE FOUND SO FAR ON THE DVD. On side one, under Languages, more to ""Francais"" so it is highlighted. Now move to the right. A little box on the right side of the screen should now be highlighted. Click on it. This gives access to one of four short, random interviews. The second secret is also on side one. Under special features, click on ""DVD Rom Features,"" then under there move so that the Main Menu shortcut is highlighted. Move to the right again, and another small box should now be highlighted. Click on that. This also gives access to four more interviews. Enjoy!",1009584000,,2976,4.7471042471042475
2136165,5,B0002WYTWG,"If you have a VHS copy of this film, please drop it in the trash ASAP and order the DVD now. In widescreen, absolutely the only way to go, the film looks great and is loaded with some really neat extras.
Director James Cameron says that he thought of the premise for the film all in one shot while he lay sick in bed while in Rome. What an excellent premise it is too. The terminator, played by Arnold is sent back in time, about 45 years, to kill the woman who would eventually give birth to the man leading the resistence movement against the ""HK's"" (hunter-killers) in the year 2029. Also sent back, to make sure the woman (plyed by Linda Hamilton) lives is Kyle Reese, played very well by Michael Biehn. The film is best when it is in the cat and mouse mode that Arnold and Biehn are continually engaging in.
In addition to a pretty darn good film, we're given two good documentaries. One of those is an informal conversation between Schwarzenegger and Cameron about how the film came to be and some of the things that went on during production. Topping that though is one of the better DVD documentaries you're likely to see in the ""Other Voices"" doc. which incorporates many of those who were involved behind the scenes and some of the painstaking processes that took place to get the film off the ground. I found it interesting that before the film was made, Director Cameron was literally broke and had to rely on his mother to send him hamburger coupons. That's one of the many little asides you'll learn about while watching the extras.
There's also the usual selection of deleted scenes, and while I like having those, one can usually tell pretty easily why they were deleted in the first place.  These are no exception.
Bottom line: this DVD is well worth the price and is a great additon to any serious collector's collection. Buy and enjoy.",1009411200,,1854,4.517857142857143

2136167,4,B0002WYTWG,"""TERMINATOR 2-JUDGMENT DAY"" is a great movie on a super great disk. Only one problem. There are too many features! Don't get me wrong, I love special features just like the next guy. But you get too many of one feature. Example, you get OVER 20 ""making of"" or ""behind the scenes"" The DVD has ALMOST every feature except camera angles. It has 3 versions of T2 on it (one is hidden. (...) ). Besides that let's look at my review:
  TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY
T2 is a classic! Ask anyone. The movie starts out about John Conners when he is 13 years old. (...) He meets up with the T-1000. A newer and better robot than T100. Don't worry, T100 is back! He is now here to protect John from the T1000 because jhe failed to kill Sarah Conners from the first film. Sarah is in a mental home because no one believes her about Terminator. They think she's another looney. So she's locked up for quite some time. The doctors said if she gets better she can see John again-They lied. With help from T100 she escapes the ""cook"" house and feels funny because T100 is nicer then from 1984. Finally, you find out about the company who made the Terminators. And it becomes a bloody battle between good and bad! What great viewing for all of the family. SEE IT!",1008460800,,1243,4.330472103004292
2136168,5,B0002WYTWG,"First off, T2 probably ranks as my favorite movie of all time. There's something about it that holds my attention viewing after viewing.
DVD arrived just in time! My video tape of T2 had worn so thin, you could probably read through it, so when my wife and I purchased our DVD player, this film was a must-buy.
The DVD version of course, offers a whole lot more than the video ever did. In addition to the ""bonus"" stuff, such as interviews and trailers, there are the scenes which were cut from the theatrical release.
If T2 is among your favorites, by all means... GET THE DVD!",1008115200,,578,4.411214953271028

I will not go into a movie review since most of you are well aware of the plot, characters, and story. The DVD is just awesome! The movie has never looked this good, I saw it in the theaters when it first came out and also owned the previous DVD. The video transfer was first rate, no edge enhancements, color bleed, or artifacting. The video quality challanges most of the new movies with it's quality. The Dolby 5.1 sound track is superb considering the original soundtrack was a mono track. The dialog is focused on the center channel and rear channels along with the subwoofer are utilized frequently. The extras are just incredible, all 2.5 hours worth. This is a must own for any DVD owner!!!",1006646400,,778,4.524822695035461

2136181,5,B0002WYTWG,"Great Action Movie. Yes it is indeed. An awesome story about a soldier from the future being sent back in time on a mission to stop a mankilling machine. The cyborg is also sent back in time to kill the mother of a child who grows up to be the most courageous leader to ever live. Just so he won't be born and teach humans how to fight against the machines they are at war with. Yes, the hero of the story speaks of how in the near distant future a nuclear war happens and wipes everything that is seen today out for good. Decades later, the most terrible war in history occurs of humans fighting machines. The machine sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, mother of John Connor, is almost indestructible and can not be beaten by an ordinary human being. The only person with the skill to dodge it's attacks and open fire upon it is Kyle Reese, the hero and soldier sent back in time to stop the evil T-800 from altering history. It comes out later in the story that Kyle Reese is John Connor's father. Yes, only he didn't live throughout the end. Reese was killed trying to blow up T-800 with a fuse. But that didn't completely destroy the machine. Sarah took him out by having him crushed with something closing down on him. She had finally learned to have the guts and courage Reese had spoken to her of. Arnold Schwarznegger makes a good villain in this movie. A really big guy going around trying to kill people. And a small man trying to stop him which helps explain him being so tough and almost impossible to beat. Arnold usually is a good guy. He plays the same character in the sequel and in that movie T-800 is the good guy sent back to protect instead of kill. I'm sure a lot of people thought there was going to be a sequel to this movie by the famous quote of Arnold himself- I'LL BE BACK!",1006041600,,1805,4.25
2136182,4,B0002WYTWG,"Arnold is back! And this time he's a good guy! I think T-800 makes a better hero than a villain. This time the bad guy is a very hard-to-kill cyborg, T-1000. More advanced and much more skilled at defeating Arnold's techniques. This time the evil cyborg is sent back to kill John Connor when he's a kid. Before the evil version of T-800 was sent back to kill his mother, Sarah Connor, so John would not be born and living to command the army of the future to gain confidence in stopping the machines trying to wipe out humanity. T-1000 is more powerful than T-800 and a much better fighter. But the story goes as follows, good guys always win. Such a shame Arnold had to destruct himself in the end. But this is an exciting action movie. Not quite as good as the first. But great and much better special effects. The quality was much better due to the fact it was made at a time technology was more advanced. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor. But this time she's a lean, mean fighter who's not going to take anyone's nonsense. Unlike before where she was an ordinary girl who was an easy target and had to be guarded by the hero from the future. But in this stoy, she can take care of herself. It's her son who needs the bodyguard to protect him from evil. A human being could not have done it against this villain. It took a machine to stop another. I hope they make a Terminator 3 sometime to continue the story.",1005436800,,1420,4.302238805970149
2136183,5,B0002WYTWG,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1984 when I was a teenager.  I thought it was a great movie then and it is still a great movie.  It doesn't seem dated at all.
  The movie is about a humanlike (cyborg) killing machine from the future that comes back to 1984 to kill a young woman  before she gives birth to a boy who will be a leader in the future. A man from the future also comes back to try and save her from the Terminator.
  The movie has a great story to it. It has a very dark and moody atmosphere to it mainly because of the perfect music that goes along with the movie. The plot line will really make you think all the way through.  A very smart film.  You will be on the edge of your seat all the way through with very few scenes to catch your breath.
  The acting in it is superb.  Arnold makes the perfect Terminator.  Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton have excellent chemistry together.
  The special effects are very nice.  Especially when you consider that computer graphics were not used back when this movie came out.  The effects are very realistic and you will never say anything looks fake.  You will probably be surprised when you watch the documentary.  The effects don't seem at all dated like some movies during that time.
  One of the main things that attracted me to this dvd is that they remixed the soundtrack to support 5.1 digital surround sound. It was originally in mono. It sounds awesome!  I have seen quite a few action, sci-fi movies that have great multi-channel sound and this movie sounds the best so far.  From the spaceships in the future to the machine gun fire, it totally surrounds you! Fantastic!
  The extras including two documentaries and deleted scenes are worth the price of admission alone. Some very interesting facts about the movie that will make you say, ""that's how they did that?!"".
  If you were too young when it came out at the theater or you have seen it on t.v. where it is edited to death you need this dvd.  Especially if you have a 5.1 surround system, this is a must have for your collection. This movie is as fresh as it was in the mid 80's and will be fresh thirty years from now.

2136185,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator is a terrific movie and a hallmark of American cinema. It has strong charecters, a good plot, awesome and exciting action sequences, a great music score, supreme acting, and great direction. I also enjoy the mega buck (eighty million dollor) sequel, but it's not nearly as strong as this masterwork. The second film is YES a very good movie. It one two more oscars than the first, and has supreme special effects, but the first film is much classier, and has much stronger charecters than T2. When Terminator 2 Judgement Day- The Ultimate Edition DVD was released, I bought it, and loved it, but said ""Doesn't anyone remember the first film? Doesn't anyone remember the one that started it?"" I always wished that a special edition of T1 would be made, and now, here it is! It's a great, brand new version, with Original Mono Sountrack, AND a brand new- Dolby Dighital 5.1 version that adds so much to the expeirence. The explosions and gunshots are not just louder, but they sound completely different. The 45 longslide with laser sighting is comletely different. It sounds a lot like it has a silencer on it. Also, the explosions are much more detailed, in terms of sound. The part where that truck explodes sounds comletely different. Basically everything does. I know that there's propably someone out there who's thinking ""Why does everyone love this new version? I love the original, the way it was seen in theatres."" If you're that person, they have, as I said, the original mono. As for special features, it's not nearly as packed and jammed as the second film is, but it's enough to satisfy me. The two documentarys are ""The Terminator- A Retrospective"", where James Cameran and Arnold Schwarzenegger sit and talk about memories. It's very nice. The other (more informative) documentary is ""Other Voices"", where lots of the actors and crew talk about the making of the film, from script to final cut and release. This one's got more info about the making, and was very interesting. You also get four trailers (I like the foreing one) and a still gallery, as well as seven ""Terminated"" scenes. Most of the scenes are just tiny little bits, but some are interesting. I was surprised that the scenes weren't restored back into the movie, but none of them are really crucial to the story. There are two scenes that are longer. One is where we watch a man take the chip from the crushed terminator and put it in his pocket, we then learn the building the terminator was crushed in was Cyberdyne. The next is one where Sarrah suggests to Reese that they blow Cyberdyne up, and a big fight and all ensues, leading to Reese crying because the trees and grass are so beautiful, and in his world they're all gone. Cool.
Now, for the hidden stuff. I thank reviwer alan5973 for telling me the hidden stuff. But, his reveiw's way back, and I don't think anyone's going to look at it. So, here's what you do. On side one, the movie, you go to extra features and click DVD rom. When you get there, highlight Special Features, and type in 5 1 2 8 4 1. Then, you go to a two page thing with a bunch of interviews. Some of the things are interesting (William Wisher plays the cop in one scene, and in T2 he's the guy at the mall taking pictures). There's some cool stuff here. Thanks again alan5973! Anyway, in addition to the new sound on the movie, you get the proper widescreen (1:85:1) format to show everything you're meant to see. The picture quality is sharp and good, unlike the awful Hemdale DVD with no features. That picture was unbearable! This picture's very good though! My only complaint is, couldn't James Cameron do a commentary for the whole movie? He does on the deleted footage, and it would be nice to have a whole commentary. Aside from that (and the fact the deleted footage wasn't restored to the movie itself) this is one great DVD that I recommend you buy. If you have the horrid older disk, trash it. Get the special edition!

2136186,4,B0002WYTWG,"""Wrong.""  So goes the film that catapulted Arnold to stardom.  And this could still be his best role ever.  They took a pumped up Teutonic giant and cast him as a taciturn, expressionless killing machine.  Perfect.  Arnold must utter less than 100 words in this movie.  That's all he needs.  If you want a modern sci-fi/action classic, this is it.  Cameron would go on to prove he is a master of action with his next film, Aliens.  Plenty to go on about here, but if you haven't seen this film, and even if you don't like violent action films, give it a try.  Its energy can't be denied, and neither can the man in the wrap-around shades uttering, ""I'll be back"" and ""The Uzi 9mm"".  Speaking of which, Dick Miller is brilliant in his brief role as the ill-fated gun shop owner.  Notice how he has no qualms about selling one of the most suspicious looking characters a veritable arsenal.  (Actually, The Terminator doesn't really pay for the guns).  Isn't America great?",1004486400,,970,4.563953488372093
2136187,4,B0002WYTWG,"The dvd is great with new soundtrak in 5.1 also in the original mono track with a new digital transfer in 16*9 Widescreen format.
Also includes a spanish audio track(very funny by the way),but the 5.1 soundtrack sounds spooky specially the gunshots but with the original mono we can hear as was made(sounds better for me).
The worst part are the special documents with an interview with Cameron & Arnie that is very boring specially because we can see any moment of the rolling in the behind the scenes;the second document is better as the terminated scenes one specially important that gives you clues about the story.
In conclusion a great dvd with full of extras,recommended,buy it,baby.",1003708800,,690,4.905982905982906

Incredible ground breaking acting by tha Schwarzenator. He manages to include an Oscar-winning performance in the action departmant. This dvd contains neva-before seen footage, way better than the Rocky dvd neva-before seen footage. Tha video transfer is so clean that yu can see Arnuld's puwerful biceps and incredible physique like neva before. Tha sound is so amazing that yu can hear tha sweat rubbing against each otha in Ahnuld's naked scene. I saw this film in my huge home theata, and I had neva had such a puwerful experience since watching Cunan tha Barbarian on dvd.  Jimmy Cameron pruves why he's tha best directur in Hullywood. Yu knew Titanic would be a great Oscar-winning film, when yu see Arnuld shuuting thousands of rounds of ammunition senselessly. In addition, Edward Furlong's role as a rebel without a cause is a can't miss. Linda Hamilton's great acting and muscular physique makes yu wonda if she is a Terminata herself. This is the best dvd out in tha market. Forgat Stallone, Willis, Seagal, Van Damme, and Edward James Olmos. When Arnie is in tuwn to kick to major liquid metal buttcheeks, you knuw that the real deal is on. Don't furgat he's a cybernatic machine frum tha year 2029.

2136189,5,B0002WYTWG,"In the history of Sequels, very few seem to have the clout to match or surpass the original movie.  This is one of those movies that far surpasses its predecessor and breaks new ground once again.  The first one was stunning because of the smooth transitions between different mock ups of the Terminator robot, stop motion animation and close up shots.  Just as innovative were the make up effects on Arnold, showing a metal creature under the organic skin of the assassin.  Not to mention it's original story, great script, solid acting and genuine emotion.  In Terminator 2, James Cameron knew that if the villain in the first movie was a tank, then the new one had to be like a Porsche.  Streamlined, efficient and incredibly dangerous, with or without weapons.  It seems Cameron got to do what he had wanted to do in the first movie, create a Terminator who is an everyman.  Someone who could slip into crowds without standing out.  Robert Patrick gets the honor of being the bad guy in this movie, the T1000 Terminator.  His steely glare and psycho-tronic movements mimic what made Arnold so convincing in the first movie.  This is a hunter, a killing machine.  And we know that if he were to ever catch up to his target, he would destroy him immediately, no hesitation.  In this sequel (and who doesn't know the story) Arnold is sent back by John Conner to protect his younger self.  The unstoppable killing machine is now reprogrammed to keep a young boy alive, and at first, he's willing to kill anyone who may threaten him.  The young John Conner, played by newcomer Edward Furlong in this movie, stops him just in time.  Cameron ingeniously writes in a different angle on machines in this movie.  The first one seemed to focus on our reliance on machines and how it would eventually  turn against us.  Now, he is making a careful edict saying that we need to show our machines who is boss.  That they should do what we tell them to do.  But eventually, this machine can learn lessons as well.  Cameron obviously grew with this story, showing the possibilities of our ingenuity and what they can be capable of.  Ultimately, good or bad, it's going to be up to us.  Once again, Cameron breaks new ground with special effects.  The computer generated shape shifting of the T1000 Terminator was something never seen before on the big screen.  It made the character all that much more frightening, especially when you see that he can go toe-to-toe with Arnold.  One of the other impressive aspects of this movie is Linda Hamilton.  Her performance is top notch.  She worked out, studied weapons and martial arts and lost weight in order to become the single minded obsessed woman she is in this movie, 10 years after having her prophesized son.  She is not the same person she was in the first movie.  Sarah Conner has changed...severely.  My only complaint was that she changed so much, there didn't seem to be a trace of the innocence, or the personality of the girl in the first movie.  But that only seems to add to the character.  It makes her seem so distant, so lost, that we realize that she has a long way to go as a character as well.  Her obsession to get to her son and for him to stay alive simply for his purpose of becoming a great leader, over shadows her own motherly instincts to just care for her son in the present.  On the DVD, there is an added scene where Kyle Reece comes back in a dream sequence, it shows Sarah's yearning for him and how much she misses him.  It is one of the few scenes that show that she has not gone completely harsh.  Cameron always knows how to direct action sequences as well.  This movie is no different.  He balances the action with a story and makes sure the movie never loses sight of it's own humanity.  The 2 Disc DVD is packed with extra features and is well worth the money.  The added scenes are cool and tend to give a little more to what we really liked seeing.  There is so much stuff on this one that it will take a while to get through it all.
Highly recommended, this movie deserves it's five stars.",1003622400,,4068,4.485013623978202
2136200,4,B0002WYTWG,"I can't say anything more about the film than has already been said. It is great fun. The DVD while good suffers from the lack of director commentary track. Considering the ""guerilla movie making"" involved, this would have been a wonderful opportunity to gain insight into the making of this film. Though the dual documentaries offers some insight, I would have welcomed Cameron providing intimate details of making this film. Otherwise, the sound and video quality are very high.",1003363200,,480,5.0886075949367084
2136201,5,B0002WYTWG,"This new ""Ultimate Edition DVD"" of Terminator 2 Judgement Day, one of the biggest box office smashes of all time, is truly The Ultimate Edition. Unless you get this outside of the US (which I did) you have two disks. One disk is the movie (THREE versions of the movie, in fact), and the next disk is all the special features. And it takes DAYS getting through every feature. I mean, three documentary, 8 trailers and TV spots, an entire script, interviews that you can access separately, and 52 chapters of behind the scenes footage, from makeup to visual effects, from editing to restoring deleted scenes. There are so many special features, this is what DVD was made for! You can also look at the original drawings of certain scenes, awesome!!!!
However, I find the real highlight of this disk (or disks) to be the movie itself, I mean WOW!!! You get three, I repeat, three, versions of the movie. One is the original theatrical version, featuring no cut out scenes (the worst), the special edition, featuring 16 minutes of additional footage (second best) and the Extended Special Edition that you need a code for (the best) which features 18 minutes of additional footage, as well as an alternate ending. Here, now, I will give you a step-by-step description of how to get this extended special edition. I'm sure most of you people reading this know how to already, but this is for those who didn't know this version existed, or don't know how to get it. What you do is, you go to the features menu. It'll say ""Theatrical Version"" and ""Special Edition"". Click on ""Special Edition"". Then, you highlight ""Play Special Edition"" and type in (you may have to type ENTER in-between each number) EIGHT TWO NINE NINE SEVEN (8 2 9 9 7) and then, the ""Go To Theatrical Version"" option changes to ""Play Extended Special Edition"". This is the definitive version of the movie. I believe that every single little, tiny scene that they cut out is in this version. Well, thats the code, now back to my review.
The picture and audio on this disk are SO awesome, you won't believe it. Crystal clear picture, and sound so loud that it's like you're in a movie theatre. The additional, restored scenes are remastered as well, and slip perfectly into the movie. If you haven't even seen the film, you won't even notice these scenes put into it. Usually, on additional scenes, the picture is dirty and shakes. Not in these added scenes. And, to make it even better, the scenes are presented in 2:35:1 widescreen anamorphic format. Yes!! Just the first disk makes this DVD the ultimate edition!! Also, there's an audio commentary by 26 members of the cast and crew, however, this commentary is just interviews put together to sound like a commentary. However, there's a noticable glitch in the theatrical version, due to the commentary. Well, if you watch this commentary on one of the special editions, you'll notice it's the same commentary as the theatrical version, but they talk about deleted scenes as well. You may, also, notice that they continue talking about the deleted ""Dream Sequence"" at the hospital, when it goes into the next scene. So, now, when you watch the theatrical version, you'll notice that the beggining scene with Sarrah Connor watching the tape from six months ago, the beggining of the scene is cut off!!! Oops! Well, that's forgivible. Now, the second disk (or the second side of the disk) has lots of special features. The three documentarys include ""The Making Of Terminator 2 Judgement Day"", ""T2 More Than Meets The Eye"", where they talk about deleted sequences and the reason they were cut. The last is ""The Making Of Terminator 2 3-D Breaking The Screen Barrier"", about the making of that 3-D terminator ride. I loved that ride (yes, I went on it) and this documentary is really interesting. The rest of the features, well, I'm not sure I kinow all of them. Maybe YOU should discover all the features on this disk. If you own the previous DVD release of T2 (which had no extras), then trash it and get this ""Ultimate Edition"". You WON'T be dissipointed.

2136203,5,B0002WYTWG,"The fact that you can play this movie in DTS is worth the price of the DVD! The sound is truly awesome! The special addition movie is the same one that was on the Pioneer special edition Laserdisc...the same exact movie. The one thing that's nice with the DVD is the scene splices (especially the dream sequence with Michael Biehn) seem to be ""seamless"" whereas the laserdisc version had traces of a splice. There is a third hidden movie that has all of the cuts spliced back in and really explores the new terminator allot more. You really get to see how much more advanced the new terminator is than the older model. They seemed to give a lot of thought to the menus, and the custom THX segment is the coolest yet! For my fellow home theater buffs, this is one to own! The sound is almost reference quality. All said and done, this is a great DVD and it has a second disc with all supplemental material. One warning, the menus on the supplemental disc can be a little confusing when trying to work your way around them.

Meanwhile, an agent (Beihn) is also sent from the future to protect her. I won't go into further plot details, but this film grabs your attention from the opening credits to the last frame.

The first thing you will notice when playing the movie is the superb video and sound quality...All of the sounds have been remixed, some deleted even. Gun shots and explosions now have more atmosphere and depth, and no longer sound like those cheap sound effects from the 1980's. Everything, including the music sounds state-of-the-art. You will not be disappointed unless you like movies to stay true to their original mixing. But I just have to say that this was a job well done....and maybe even one of the best quality DVD movies in my whole collection.

2136208,4,B0002WYTWG,"Though I'm no fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger films, I must confess an admiration for this 1984 science fiction thriller. Tautly directed by James Cameron, The Terminator mixes time travel, cyborgs, romance (however brief) and action sequences without getting bogged down by lengthy, contrived dialogue. Cameron manages to squeeze a great deal out of a miniscule budget: the special effects are good but do not overpower the story (something that almost derailed the sequel). Schwarzenegger is perfectly suited to play a relentless killing machine, exuding quiet but deadly menace in every scene, particularly the police station massacre. Biehn and Hamilton are also good fleshing out the typical hero/heroine roles without needless exposition. Like the Terminator itself, the chase sequences are unrelenting and gripping; Cameron takes advantage of night shooting, harsh fluorescence and a 1980s electronic music score to add to the tone of endless pursuit. The new Special Edition DVD is a dazzling, remastered print--I have never seen this film look and sound so good--and the bonus features (deleted scenes, interviews, documentaries) are welcome treats. Despite its low budget, The Terminator avoids being a cheap, by-the-numbers sci-fi/action flick (a pity many of my fellow film geek friends stick up their noses at this ""action movie"")and proves James Cameron has the talent to create intelligent, exciting popcorn films (Titanic notwithstanding) that appeal even to film geeks.",1002585600,,1483,5.625
2136229,5,B0002WYTWG,"The Terminator has made it's mark in the realm of science fiction, and it shows. It's not enough that Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly cast in the title role, but his unrelenting coldness is even more explained to us through the stories and flashbacks of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese (""You still don't get it, do you? He'll find her. That's what he does! That's all he does!!"") Biehn's performance grabs me every time I see it, just as Arnold's agressive coldblooded behavior also draws my attention. And in the middle is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who sees her normal life slip away in a matter of hours, (""Come on, do I look like the Mother of the future? I mean am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook"")yet is still able to draw strength from her pain and loss and fight to stay alive. It doesn't get much better than this, folks.
I wish people would stop being so hard on the special effects of this film. You can't compare it to T2. The Terminator had a shoestring budget of $6 million, while T2's budget was something like $80 million. Of course the special effects are better in the sequel...especialy when you've got an extra $74 million to spend this time around. Instead, people should be commending the hard work Stan Winston and company gave on The Terminator effects. Sure, that's not Arnold's face when he takes his eye out, but hey,...not bad. In fact it doesn't even look half bad when he puts his glasses back on just before the real Arnold is put back on camera wearing his glasses. The arm surgery is very impressive. I remember as a kid I couldn't watch that scene because you can see a vein wrapped around the metel skeleton while he's working on fixing his fingers. Looks pretty realistic to me. Take these things into consideration the next time you want to take pot shots at the visual effects of the film.
With the new 5.1 Surround Sound Mix newly created on this DVD, there's a lot to talk about. First off, the remixed sounds of most of the guns and explosions have been changed. The 44 Longslide with laser sighting sounds completely different when Arnold fires it. Same goes for the Oozie 9MM, Reese's shotgun, the whole ball of wax. At first you might be destracted by the changes since we're so use to the mono version. And since this DVD also includes the mono version, you can go back and forth and listen to the differences. The explosions, such as the giant armored machines of the future being destroyed, sound terrific. They really put a lot of work into making these explosions even more memorable. It almost reminds me of how George Lucas redid the explosion of the first Death Star for the special edition of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, except we don't get any additional visual effects to go along with it, just better sound.
Yes, it's true that you don't get as many extra features like you do on T2, (here in the USA, both T1 & T2 are on one disc with one side used for the film and the other side used for the extras) but still, it's nice to have them. I think most would say that the deleted scenes are the best asset. The only shot of Arnold that was deleted was after he killed the other Sarah Connor, you see him go back to his car very slowly..not in a hurry..and drive away. Very very creepy. The other scenes range from Lt. Traxler (Paul Winfield) beginning to believe Kyle's story is true, to scenes with Kyle & Sarah fighting over doing something to the Cyberdyne Company as we witness Kyle breaking down because it's so hard for him to look at the green grass and the trees, because in his world it's all gone. Director James Cameron explains that it is a good scene but decided that he didn't want Reese breaking down more than once and he already does that right before the love scene, which could not be cut. And of course, there is the deleted scene of discovering that the factory that the Terminator was destroyed in was actually Cyperdyne Systems. We see one man find the CPU chip and put it in his pocket, but it was better to cut all this out and use it to better advantage for the sequel. Throw in a few trailers & TV spots(the teaser trailer reveals that the original title was just ""Terminator"", not ""The Terminator""), some short retrospective documentaries (although the original ""making of"" that's been out on video is not present), storyboards, script ect...and you've got a pretty well rounded special edition.  But wait!  There's more!
There are also some hidden features on the disc, located on Side 1. Just go to the Special Features section and then choose DVD-ROM Features. Once there, take your remote control and type in the following numbers (very slowly): 5, 1, 2, 8, 4, & 1. (These numbers stand for the date of the Terminator and Kyle Reese's arrival (May 12, 1984) You'll be taken to a special hidden 2 page section, with about 29 different topic interviews done by James Cameron, Michael Biehn and others.  The interviews are done with slide pictures and not real video.  The topics range from how two kids actually played the part of the little boy who takes Sarah's picture for $4, Hemdales lack of faith in the picture, technical aspects, deleted scenes, to comaparisons to T2 ect.  Very interesting stuff.  Plus, on page 2 there is some reading material on a topic called ""Chrono-Surfing: A Brief History of Time Travel"", written by Randall Frakes (co-author of The Terminator novelization).  So those of you scoffing about the lack of extras should check this material out.  It's a very nice ""Easter Egg"" find.  Plus, get the DVD soon and receive a fancy lithograph cover case of Arnold.

The picture and sound quality was well transfered to DVD.
The ""extra features"" really didn't seem worth the money. The extra footage they managed to dig up is not very interesting. I can see why the whole mis-matched collection of 30 second clips was removed from the final movie. In other words, if you already own this movie in one format or another and are thinking about getting the DVD for the ""Terminated Scenes"", don't bother.
The documentary was alright. I would have prefered to see it emulate the style of the TV show ""Movie Magic"" (or some name like that. It was on the Discovery Channel a few years ago)

First off the transfer is ok, although not much better then what you would get on the old out of print dvd of the movie. The sound though is great especially if you have a good sound systam, I don't so it did not matter as much to me as it will to a lot of the people who will buy this movie. The features are medicore a few deleted scenes with very breif commentery from cameron[.]  There are many storyboard and stills that aspiring artists will enjoy and they will take a good hour to go thourgh all of them, as well as the orginal story treatment of the movie which was a lot more dark and violent then the cut is now the terminator skins people and it's pretty gross, I prefer this version, but it's intreasting to see the way it was in the begining. There are a few documentries including a new one that I haven't watched yet and the orginal featurette that was on the live video release which is pretty  entrtaining. My main problem though is this disc is a flipper and I hate that, I refuse to buy goodfellas not only because it's barebones, but it is the only other movie I know of other then T2 that is a flipper. This makes me angry because I have poor cordanation and you have to be very careful holding the disc to not smudge it up, I have already done that, Although it has yet to effect play, But it will wear out much quicker then all my other disc's.

2136237,4,B0002WYTWG,"Ok,  this movie is really good.  If you've seen the first one you know that in the future(well acctually Judgement day...According to the movie,  was suppose to  have happened 4 years ago)a program called Skynet has waged war on mankind with an army of robots.  However a man, John Conner,  insures the victory of the humans over the robots.  Knowing its own doom,  Skynet created a new type of robot.  Something that feels no pitty, no pain, no fear...The Terminator.
Skynet sent the terminator back in time to kill Coner's mother before he was even born.  But Conner,  sends back a soldier to stop the terminator.
  Now in this,  the sequal,  young Conner is with foster parents and his mother is in a mental institution.  Skynet,  in an attempt to assasinate Conner,  sends back another Terminator in time to kill him.  However, Conner(from the future) reprograms another Terminator to protect  young conner.  Now,  in the preasant day,  the two terminators fight a battle wich will decide the future of the planet and mankind.
With alot of action and some neat terminator effects,  this movie is on of the best around, though the original ""The Terminator"" will always remain a classic.  I very highly reccomend that you see this movie and the original terminator.

2136250,5,B0002WYTWG,"Academy Award winning director James Cameron envisioned
this sci fi classic it's reaction created something never before
seen and set the standerd of action films to come of the 80's ,
as well as many rip off's. But Camerons nightmarish vison as cold
and as strikingly real he envisioned it, it hit a chord with many
people around the world as possibly a scary reality that may come
true. The story starts in a war torn Los Angeles in 2029 a place
unrecognizable gothic and shrouded with mechinized machines that
hunt down the remaining survivors of judgement day and are now
fighting the war against the machines avoiding hunter killers
and the most deadly machine of all the terminator.
  When one of the terminators is sent back through time to 1984
who which strikingly looks like Arnold Schwartzenagger is sent to
terminate Sarah Connor who is played by Linda Hamilton who will
carry the future leader of the resistance Jhon Connor , he will
stop at all costs to complete his mission. When a protector from
the future is sent in to the past Kyle Reese played by Micheal
Beihn his job is to protect Sarah at all costs even if it means
his life. Little does he know that he will start to fall in love
with Sarah but there task in front of them is far more important
then either of them and that they ever imagined in this important
sci fi classic that started a cult phenomonon.
  James Cameron envisioned not just an ordinary action film it
has a heart the terminator is more of a dramatic film then even a
sci fi film but it does classify more as sci fi , which sets the
tone for it's much more lavish and ground breaking sequal T2 ,
new redifined sound and loaded with new options this new vision
of this film is now kept for the new millenium grab it it's worth any price.",1002067200,,1779,4.414634146341464

2136257,5,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron has to be one of the finest Directors of our time.  An elite perfectionist, he is one of the few who knows how to meticulously balance a love story smack dab in the middle of a Science Fiction action movie.  The story starts in modern day 1984 (not so modern anymore) where a cyborg has been sent back in time to destroy the birth mother of the machines greatest enemy so that their nemesis cannot be created.  Thankfully the girl has a common name and lives in Los Angeles where several women exist with the same name.  Being logical, the killer intends to take them all out.  One by one the women fall victim to this `serial killer' and Sarah, played by a younger Linda Hamilton, starts to think she's next...and she's right.  Enter the man to save her life, Kyle Reece, played intensly by Michael Biehn.  He's a soldier from the future who is sent back to protect her from this unfeeling machine.  The best part about these two coming through the portal from the furture is that they come through with nothing.  So they have to rely on what is already in 1984.  This eliminates many complex elements in the story, as well as some costlier special effects.  It keeps grounded a little more.  Since the weaponry they're forced to use is less sophisticated, the Terminator is harder to  kill.  Kyle and Sarah find themselves not only running for their lives but finding something more in each other.  This movie sounds like a cheesy love story within an action movie but there is a special chemistry between the two leads and Cameron juggles them all like a professional circus performer.  Both Hamilton and Biehn's character have a dire innocence about them.  Sarah has no idea that anything she ever does could be considered so important, and being told the reason why this machine is after her makes her world seem that much smaller.  Reece has never known deep emotions of love, and the only women he has ever known are tough soldier types.  Getting to know Sarah makes him really feel what he knows was in his heart already.
No one but Arnold could play the Cyborg Tank that stalks poor Linda Hamilton throughout the movie.  His unstoppablility is only outdone by his cold unfeeling exterior and deadly violent actions.  The chemistry between Biehn and Hamilton is strong and believeable.  The action scenes are intense and you always know what's going on.  I would highly recommend this film.  It set a standard for many other Sci Fi films, as well as gave birth to one of the greatest sequels of all time, Terminator 2, Judgement Day.",999993600,,2555,4.626666666666667

I haven't viewed the dvd yet, but it has to be better than that horrible dvd peddled off a few years ago.  What else can I say, Arnold is truly terrifying from beginning to end.  The scene in which he tears the punk's heart out still scares the hell out of me everytime.  It is just so disheartening to see no expression as he mows down old women and then proceeds to unload his gun into them.  Cameron shows his extraordinary talent for action-suspense pictures in this film, it is engrossing its entire running length, never once letting up.  It is a truly satisfying action thrill ride.  If you haven't seen this, you need to.  And if you already have, you are probably going to buy this.  So I will say no more.",999820800,,810,4.531034482758621

The best part overall, is the introduction of a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (the DVD has been out in the UK for a while) but if you want a real treat, watch the deleted scenes on the second disc and be gob smacked at how Cameron would consider leaving these out of any restored edition. There's one superb scene between Reece and Connor when she realises they should take out Cyberdyne systems itself. The re-introduction of these scene into the main film (as with the others) would have fleshed out the movie a great deal and set the scene more for the sequel. The character development of Sarah Connor from unconfident waitress to gun-ho vigilante in the second would be less of a shock. Cameron states some of these scenes were removed to maintain the pace of the film, but now, 17 years later proper reinstatement would have breathed new life into the film. At least with the T2 disc we have the option to watch 1 of 3 versions.

A lot of people claim, that The Terminator is better than Judgement Day, but I like both of them - there are things that make me favor the 1st and parts because of which I adore the 2nd.
The story: Arnold Schwarzenegger finally managed to become to good guy, although he's still a killer-machine. The cyborg has been re-programmed and sent back through time by John Connor, leader of the great rebellion, to protect his teenaged ego from the '90s. The young John Connor's got his own Terminator now: Holy [*]! But of course there is a bad one too, trying to kill Connor, while still young and vulnerable and not the strong John C. of the future.
The special effects of this movie are fantastic, there are a lot of explosions, shootings, and Terminator-actions you just can not can enough from!
Deleted Scenes:
1. John and his mother operate the Terminator in order to turn the switch on which is responsible for the cpu's learing process - so Arnie can get more human-like. They open the T's head and enter the port, where the all-controlling chip is. For John's mother this is a turning point, a possibility to destroy the Terminator (although he is the good one!). Find out for yourself what exactly happens in this scene!
2. John teaches the T how to smile. A very funny scene, providing a hilarious expression on Arnold Schwarzenegger's face!
3. Alternate Ending: Interesting, but I like the original one better. Check out for yourself!
4. There are some more, but the ones listed above are the ones I can remember. Sorry for my bad memory, but these are the best scenes!
Other cool stuff:
If you stay long enough on the menu from where you can access the trailers and other stuff but don't enter one of the sub-memories, the Terminator's face suddenly appears and tells you to get out. Some other optical ""snacks"" happen at complete random! Check it out!
The trailer for the special edition is superb: Imagine lashing flames, the Terminator-theme (dum-dum-dum-dum-du-du-dum ... like that), then a rough, hard voice, while you see a bleeding T, exploding s*** and stuff like that: ""Remember the action, Remem the danger, Remem the emotion ... if you thought, you'd seen it all, LOOK AGAIN ..."" You then see quick cuts from the deleted footage -> my favorite trailer!
A featurette about the T-3D show you can experience in the Universal Studios. You do get some parts of the show, making you think about a short trip down to Florida ...
AND A LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT LOT MORE!
The whole menu might be a little bit confusing at the beginning because there is so many of stuff to explore, but you'll get used to it. T2 is the mother of all special editions! Buy the movie along with its prequel!",997660800,,3030,4.592250922509225
2136278,5,B0002WYTWG,"put a bullet through your head.
I own the British (PAL) release of this Special Edition, which contains the same material and cool stuff as the U.S. version, with the solem difference, that it was released in the early spring of this year - so I already have this cool dvd for some time, hehe! I think everone who is deliberating about buying the SPECIAL EDITION of the TERMINATOR will know what it is about. That's why I won't talk about the movie, but about the extras. The menu design (at least that of the British version) is very cool. You get the typical Terminator theme - that thumping, metallic pound which is perfectly protraying the apocalypse which is about to arise - while entering Cyberdine Systems, and suddenly your TV is filled with the endoskeleton of the Terminator, constantly moving, showing its high-tech construction from every angle. From there on you can access two kinds of extra material: still material, like pictures gallerys, scripts and stuff like that (there really is a lot, I own it since March and have only watched the documentaries) AND filmed material: trailers, teasers, international trailers, 3 (at least that is what I think , don't shoot me if there are four) very interesting docs which are generally a mixture of cast'n'crew interviews/behind-the-scenes/who did the director think of that great story - just cool stuff. Then there are the deleted scenes. Damn, they are well-done! I don't have a clue, why the studio cut these scenes, offered in this un-cut, never-before-seen, director's special edition release - they are extrordinary, honest! They give you deep insight in the whole story, you know, doom, devastation, apocalypse, the machines take over control ...
This dvd spec edition is great! The movie is great, has ever been, but finally gets the treatment it deserves! If you think, you have seen this movie too often already, THINK AGAIN. I was thinking much the same way, but just could not get around that almost childish cupido to desperately long for something. I surrendered and know what?! I am glad I bought it.

2136280,3,B0002WYTWG,"While it is true that T2 boasts some excellent special effects and elaborate action scenes, it's just not as well-made as the original. For one, it's frequently way too dramatic and serious.  It's practically humorless, while T1 was chock-full of dark humor.  Why Cameron didn't add the same wit into this sequel baffles me.  The drama and talk between the good characters is prententious and overlong. Secondly, the pacing is not as good.  T2 is too long, and by the time we get to the great climax, we no longer care what happens to the characters.  We just want more action.  While T2 is long and has ups and downs, T1 is thrilling throughout. Third, the characters are extremely unlikable.  Sarah is portrayed as a tough woman who has no problem holding a child at gunpoint and beating up anyone who gets in her way.  John, for the first half hour or so, is just plain annoying. Finally, the film is just bland and uninspired.  There are plenty of shoot-outs and explosions, but it's very tiresome and hardly exciting.  T1, however, was full of suspense.

2136284,5,B0002WYTWG,"""Terminator 2"" is one of those rare instances where a sequel lives up to its precedor. While ""The Terminator"" is a darker, more ominous film, T2 is a more streamline action/popcorn movie. The plot here is still very strong, and with the addition of great acting, awesome effects, impressive action sequences and the genious direction of James Cameron, you have another one of the greatest sci-fi action movies out there.
Here is the basic plot of this movie. John Connor is a young boy in our present day. Another terminator is sent from the future to try to destroy him, this time the advanced T-1000, a liquid metal terminator that is virtually invincible. Arnold is back, of course, this time as the good guy, a ""good"" terminator sent by the John of the future to protect his past self.
The movie itself is a masterpeice. As the plot iteself advances during the movie, you connect with the characters quite emotionally, making the ending all the more impacting. Robert Patrick is perfect as the villian in this film, just as Schwarzenneger was in the first. The special effects are out-of-this-world, and the action scenes are some of the best ever on film. And, like the first, there is just the right amount of dark humor thrown in to keep the movie from being too serious.
NOW ONTO THE DVD EXTRAS! This is one of the best DVD's to have ever been released just for this reason. There are over 6 hours of extras here, everything from movie trailers to behind the scenes footage, commentary; everything a fan could ever ask for. And the quality of the DVD is incredible, too, the sound and picture are both some of the best I've ever seen. Simply put, this is a DVD that belongs in the hands of anyone who owns a player, especially for Terminator and action movie fans. If you like this, may I also suggest the following, and vice-versa.

The killer just plows through everything and everyone to get to his target.  And the targets cause a bit of damage themselves trying to get away.

The one thing I was startled by is how dated some of the special effects look! and this is enhanced by the good quality of the picture on the DVD, check out the bit's where Arnie is looking in the mirror and repairing his eye, and also when he's been burnt down to the endo-skeleton and he's chasing Sarah at the end, Pure Comedy effects!

2136299,5,B0002WYTWG,"I have seen this movie many times, I know most of the lines and all the parts get better every time.  I rented a horrible HBO Video version of the movie and the screen was horrible and the audio wasn't too big either, a rough sort of mono mix.  The DVD must do justice and take out the grayness in the colors, add more color and of course improve the sound.  The gunshots and explosions sounded horrible I think in the original tape so I think that is improved on the DVD.  The front cover looks a lot different than the original movie poster and mostly the video boxes but get it? new cover-new movie?  The synth music is great I think, it gives it the whole robot 80s feeling that the 2nd movie couldn't make with the stupid strings and steel clank noises.  The first one seems better because it's so original and it focuses more on story instead of action and guns.  This movie has its gross parts like Arnold punching a guy through the stomach, taking out his eyeball, and sliting his arm to look at machinery but it's all old effects so it's really fake but much more realistic than Friday the 13th. Anyways, this movie is classic and it doesn't make me scared anymore because 1997 has already passed and that's when the war was supposed to happen.

2136328,5,B0002WYTWG,"Many people, with due right, consider T2 to be a modern classic. But many also forget where the story began. In 1983, James Cameron made ""The Terminator"". It's budget was a lot less than that T2, but Cameron employed a number of cunning tricks to get the story across. For instance, he set his story in modern day so that he didn't have to pay for futuristic sets and effects. After the - frankly awful - first US release of ""The Terminator"" on DVD, this double-disc bonanza is welcomed with open arms.  The extras are great (apart from the script drafts - who wants to read pages and pages on a television anyway?), and the package is nicely designed with a modern ""metallic"" take on the T1 poster. There's even a great deleted scene where Michael Biehn gets all emotional about grass! Okay, so it can be too violent for some and too silly for others, but its a classic all on its own. It boosted Arnie's career, and still remains one of his best performances to date. The only odd thing is why the prologue text is presented as subtitles at the beginning of the film and not overlayed onto the image. But 5 stars it deserves, and 5 stars it gets. I sure hope (living in the UK, where the Region 2 version of this DVD is already out) that the currently un-released Region 2 disc of Terminator 2 (or, the R2-T2 - ha) is just as good.",994550400,,1333,4.332
2136329,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 stands as the best action/science-fiction ever put to film; and the DVD lives up to that high standard.
Terminator 2, the sequel (obviously) to James Cameron's landmark Terminator movie, takes that films atmosphere of terror, of hopeless and heroic struggle against murderous and unfeeling machines, and kicks it up several dozen notches. This time, our mechanized friend from the future(Arnold Schwarezenegger) is fighting for the good guys; fighting to protect humanity's one hope in the future in the War Against the Machines, John Connor (played by Edward Furlong) from quite possibly the coolest sci-fi villain ever created; the shape-shifting and seemingly unstoppable T1000 (Robert Patrick, now of X-Files fame.)
Since we last saw our merry band of apocalypse fighters, John's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has been locked up in the looney bin for professing her belief that a man from the future saved her life from a killer robot and impregnated her with her son. But when her now-estranged son realizes that her tale was more then an insane rant, and gets his hulking robotic friend to help break her out, the spectacular action gets going (and going, and going.)
The action sequences alone are worth owning the movie. Using revolutionary (especially for the time) special effects, Cameron creates an adrenaline-pumping thrillride that has yet to be matched in the intensity of its atmosphere (and holds its own special effects wise, even against new-comers such as The excellent-if-slightly over-rated Matrix).
 But there's more to this then great action; Linda Hamilton's performance as a fanatically militant mother with a clear vision of the dark future awaiting humanity is superb, and again, helped along by Cameron's strong visual style (the visuals from that ""Judgement Day"" dream never quite leave your head after you've seen it, even once!) And Edward Furlong's attempts to bond with his emotionally-incapacitated protector range from comical to touching, and provide another emotional base upon which the film works to its dramatic, explosive conclusion. To top it all off, this DVD, to put it simply, rocks. The visual quality, audio quality, the features (6 HOURS of content!), my goodness. All I can say is that this is a DVD experience simply unmatched by anything else (especially since I had the fortunate benefit of watching it on a 43"" Sony Projection TV with 5.1 Surround Sound!)
Whatever Cameron-less machinations (pun-intended) might be undertaken with the future of this franchise, this flick stands as a towering achievement of high-octane, action-packed, smart sci-fi.",994032000,,2623,5.335748792270532

Three versions of the film, three documentaries, four trailers, audio commentary, spectacular picture and sound, kick [butt] animated menus, talent profiles, script and a full supplement that will take you until Judgment Day to finish reading. Awesome!

2136334,5,B0002WYTWG,"""The Terminator"" is one of James Camerons earlier films, and one can say his earlier movies were more ""personal."" The Terminator is a masterpeice on film, especially considering the incredible low budget it was filmed on, $6 million. The special effects can't hold a candle to the sequel, but the story is stronger here, and the characters are more easily identified with.
Here is the basic plot (although I don't want to say too much). In the future, a supercomputer starts a nuclear war to destroy mankind. The resistance is led by John Connor, so the computer sends the Terminator (arnold) back in time to kill Johns mother before he is even conceived. The John from the future sends Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother.
Arnold is perfect in his role, even though his screen time and his lines are limited, his impression is easily made. The acting here is superb, and the mood of the relentless killing machine makes this an incredibly thrilling movie to watch. The chase scenes are incredible, as well as the other action segments, including the ever famous police station shoot-out (I'll be back...). But along with the great action is the whole mood of this film, especially the relationship formed between Sarah and Kyle (resulting in a suprising plot twist that you'll have to watch the movie to find out). You connect with these two people, and feel their emotions, their fear; and that element is perfectly combined with the thrilling suspense of the story. Also thown in is a little bit of black comedy to lighten the veiwer from the intensity of the film (including one scene cut from TV. For years I only watched the copy I taped off of TV, when I saw this one scene after I finally bought the tape, I laughed for minutes on end).
I don't own this movie on DVD, but from what I've read the sound is supposed to be fairly poor. In my opinion, though, this film is so good that even if the sound doesn't take full advantage of the DVD system, it is still an incredible movie experience nonetheless. I first saw this movie when I was 11 years old (I'm 16 now), and since then it has been my favorite. If you enjoy this movie, I suggest these movies as well, and vice-versa.

The movie itself is an original and frightening action/thriller with a dark, grainy look and an '80s feel to it. The scene in the Technoir gives me chills. It moves in slow motion, then becomes fast and explosive. This film made Arnold a star, and he was born to play the ""Terminator"". He's chilling, realistic, and scary. At first, he didn't want to play this character of an emotionless cyborg, but after reading the script, he did.

2136360,5,B0002WYTWG,"Imagine now small explosion which emits a ball of light and a beam of light scanning across the screen from left to right, sound following adjacent to the beam, then a small sheet of metal with the logo ""T2"" gradually getting closer.  As it grows larger, you hear footsteps behind you getting closer.  The logo pauses, likewise for the footsteps.  In a reflection off the logo, the terminator aim a shotgun towards the logo.  With the exploding thunder of a shotgun and shattering sound of metal bursting to pieces, you realize the ""T2"" logo is no more.  Whilst the metal slowly melts, you notice the liquid metal joining back together.  When pieces become a whole, the puddle forms and slowly rises.  The engulfing tone heard, so recognizably noted is the THX symbol.  You embrace your seat as you witness the letters of the THX symbol being born.
That is my favorite part of this DVD.  Which, I'd have to say, was hard to decipher.  This DVD in general just knocks any of the competition out of the water.  This should be the mark of what DVDs should be modeled after.  The reflective aluminum case alone will tell you that this ain't no ordinary DVD.  The menu system is unbelievable.  It is truly remarkable how interactive and flowing the menu is.  Working around the fact that it is complicated to navigate, enjoy watching all the actions taking place when changing menu screens.  There are hidden features (easter eggs) a-plenty in this DVD.
The movie itself is flawless.  With three different types to choose from, theatrical, special edition, and ultimate special edition, you might be sitting at your couch for a while now.  The special effects was so elite for it's time you would think it was a movie made recently.  However you have to stop to think that this movie was made a little over 10 years ago now.  You don't even have to have wanted watched the first one or even HAVE to have watched the first one to sit through this one.  This is a story and movie of it's own.  Beautiful transfer unlike the VHS or Laser Disk version of this movie.
The sound is phenominal.  Whenever I feel the need to show off my system, I use this movie as a reference.  Dolby Digital EX and DTS ES sound.  I am one to attest that sound MAKES the movie.  Without having the sounds bursting through each discrete channel, I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie as much.  Thankfully this DVD looks and sounds wonderful.  As a demo, I've described the newly developed THX symbol specially made for this DVD alone.  not only that but the Dolby Digital and DTS intro's are remarkable nonethess.  After you rewind those three things a few times, get past the intro and go onto the prologue.  This is where the fun begins.  Explosions a-plenty, firing and beams from all around you.  Airbornes circling around you.  Not to mention Lazers being shot directly at you.  Rockets shot from behind you, coasting over you, and then exploding in front of you.  Crackling of bones and metal being overrun.  Mid-Air Explosions and then a final crash down to the ground, literally sweeping you off of your feet.  And this is just the prologue.

In this movie, a terminator superior to Arnold is sent back to kill John Connor, but this time Arnold is protecting him.

2136367,4,B0002WYTWG,"Completely different from the first film. James Cameron goes a lot beyond his first attempt. He plays a dramatic twist and trick on everyone by making the  terminator  (or rather its sibling) of the first film the protector of John who is now born and kicking. But another terminator has been sent, entirely made of a special metal that makes him able to take any form he wants. The first thing achieved by the good one is to save John from the bad one. Then He saves the mother who is in a carceral psychiatric hospital. Then he prepares the attack against the bad one. But here James Cameron goes beyond this surface. The good terminator becomes a good father substitute for John. He learns human emotions, even if he will never cry, and he also learns human feelings and motivations and he will help in changing the future completely by destroying the research that would produce the thinking machines and the terminators. Then he deals with the bad terminator and manages to get him molten in a tank of metal in fusion, then to destroy the chip and arm that had already been produced by a research worker and a computer firms that had been destroyed in the meantime, and finally to go beyond his mission and all human feelings and destroy the second existing chip that would produce the machine-dominated future by destroying or having himseld destroyed in the metal in fusion. There is thus some hope that the future could change. Here James Cameron is really optimistic : the human race can use machines to transcend the future and the past to change the past in order to have a better future. He just forgets that if one man has invented this chip, it is someting possible in the human society at a certain moment of its development, and hence at least one other man, if not two or three are on the same line of research and will get to the same results, but not in the US this time, or maybe in the US after all, why not. There is no escape from the future of humanity, no matter how dark it may look, and there is A FATE in this historical perspective, even if this fate might accept some variations. But the general line survives and will always come to life. This would have given a pessimistic twist to the story and this was avoided by James Cameron. That is just what people like Stephen King, or some other science fiction writers avoid : Doomsday is necessarily down the road, a man-made artificial doomsday that has little to do with the Apocalypse but that means the end of humanity anyway, and maybe some resistance that will maybe be successful, at least for a time.

2136368,4,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron in this first film envisages the future of the Human Race in Los Angeles in 2029, after the first nuclear war that was started by intelligent machines produced by men at the end of the 1990s. Those machines took over the whole decision process and decided to get rid of the human race through a nuclear war that they started by attacking the Russians. Some resistance exists because a small minority of human beings survived, because the machines  need them as slaves. So an underground army appeared and is ruthlessly chased by the machines. The leader is a certain John Connor. But machines decides to use a brand new time-travel machine to get back in the past and change the future by destroying the mother of that John before he was ever born. The resistance sends one of them to protect her and destroy the  terminator  who is supposed to do the dirty job. The soldier that is sent will succeed in his mission and destroy the Terminator before he fulfills his mission, but he will also fall in love with Sally Connor and become john's father. There is here a contradiction because this soldier has flash-forwards and he sees himself as a soldier admiring a picture of Sally, how can he has taken this picture to the future if he had to come back to the past to impregnate Sally with John, knowing that he will not be able to go back to the future. But the action is tight and this  detail  is not too visible. The film shows how the human race can resist, though they can't do more, against the dictatorshop of machines. It is in a way optimistic. But not so much because this does not change the future, but only guarantees that a leader will exist for this resistance in the future.

2136376,5,B0002WYTWG,"Lean, mean and efficient. Like its title-character, so is James Cameron's breakthrough film, ""The Terminator."" Securing its status as a sci-fi classic almost immediately upon impact, it made a star out of a certain Austrian bodybuilder, introduced Hollywood to one of the finest blockbuster directors of our time and forever changed the landscape of both the science fiction and action genres.

The film opens with a muscle-bound machine -- or a ""Terminator"" as they are more commonly known -- (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arriving in Los Angeles, strictly for business purposes. It seems he has been sent back in time after his creators -- the man-made machines that have taken over and enslaved civilization -- have exhausted all their resources in trying to squash a pesky pest in resistance leader John Connor. His mission: destroy Connor's mother, (Linda Hamilton) before he has even been conceptualized, thus ensuring victory for all machine kind. Soon enough the bad bot finds a thorn in his side, as the resistance has found a way to send one of their own, a solider by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), back in time to preserve the future fruit of Miss Connor's loins.

What is often forgotten about the film amidst its cultural impact is just how tightly-paced and well oiled it really is. There truly isn't a moment of fat to be found here. Keeping things under the two hour mark, Cameron crams just as much action as he does character into the film. Sure, there are action scenes galore and you can bet it'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Crucial to the film's success though are moments where the film breathes, letting in moments of social commentary and humor like fresh air at all the right moments. To be sure, the Terminator's pursuit of Kyle and Sarah is made all the more intense because you believe in them and are placed amidst the chaos via your own investment in the characters.

While Schwarzenegger is absolutely unforgettable as the unstoppable killing machine, the film is certainly helped a great deal by Biehn's intensity and commitment to material that may have sounded ridiculous on paper. Hamilton plays it straight as the girl-next-door type caught in the crossfire. Shame her career never really extended beyond this film and its sequel, as she really embodies a character you want to root for. Of course, none of this would even matter if not for Cameron's knack for white-knuckled action and tension. Almost like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" with a robot, the film is stripped down and singularly focused. As Reese states early on, The Terminator will not stop until Sarah is dead. Keeping true to such a theme, the film is intense from front to back.

While there are certainly things that date the film -- some rough effects by today's standards, Linda Hamilton looking a bit like Joe Dirt -- it has held up remarkably well over the years. At close to 30 years of age, there are few films that have come along in its wake that can even compare. Even if you've seen it a hundred times, it still entertains like few films of its ilk can. Truly a bonafide classic, ""The Terminator"" stands in a class by its own. Be sure to look out for the equally awesome sequel, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" but beware of the diminishing returns brought on by two later sequels and a well-meaning but utterly unnecessary TV series.

It comes on two discs, has gorgeous packaging, and, apparently: ""The first disc has the movie plus a DVD-ROM feature containing three different versions of the screenplay, which can be read scene-by-scene along with the film. On the second disc there are seven deleted scenes, including a fascinating foreshadowing of Sarah Connor's mission in T2, as well as trailers and TV spots. There are also two ""making of"" featurettes, one being an 18-minute piece from1992 based around a friendly at-home chat with Cameron and Schwarzenegger (""We did the first Terminator for the cost of your motor-home on the second film"", jokes the director to the actor). The hour-long ""Other Voices"" featurette is an in-depth montage of cast and crew reminiscences covering all aspects of the production from its initial genesis as a fevered nightmare to the ""guerrilla"" filmmaking of getting the final shots. Script collaborator Bill Wisher neatly sums up the movie as ""It's a Wonderful Life, with guns"". The second disc also contains a stills archive of production photographs, James Cameron's amazing original conceptual artwork, plus his first story treatment.""

2136381,5,B0002WYTWG,"""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is one of the great entertainments. First released in 1991, it still feels as fresh and new today as it did back then. Director James Cameron (Titanic) presents a stylish, spectacular yet intelligent action piece that also has some of the best special effects ever conceived for a motion picture. The screenplay is intricate, the characters entertaining and interesting, and there is a lot of style in the photography and camera work. The performances are also superb, especially Linda Hamilton's. The film's technical credits are so immpecable that even today I've seen few films that match it.  The action sequences are fantastic and incredible. The T-1000 is still probably the best film villain of the last decade. This is a pulse-pounding, bone-crunching, sometimes visceral action picture that raises the bar for filmmakers of the action, special-effects genre. I think only Michael Bay has recently produced anything that can compete with James Cameron's second best film after his masterpiece, ""Titanic."" ""Terminator 2"" is a great entertainer.",984614400,,1081,5.396449704142012

Basically the same idea as the original only instead of kill the mother its kill the kid himself.  Great special effects and the best special edition to ever be made.  Actors played their parts well the only flaw is; the original is based in 1984, they had sex in '84 which meant the kid was probably born in '85.  they have the kid as a thirteen year old in T2  making it the year 1998 yet they say the earth blows up in the year 1997.

2136384,5,B0002WYTWG,"Although my DVD collection isn't extensive, it holds enough that there's quite a gap between those which are exceptional, and those that fall short.  T2 'The Ultimate' certainly fits with the few exceptional DVD's that I've come across.
It's been many years in the coming, but it's certainly been worth the wait.  When T2 first came out, I was full of anticipation as I went to the movie theater as a young kid and saw it.  When I heard there was a new DVD coming out, I was just as excited.. and it didn't let me down.  The movie itself, on DVD, is amazing.. without a doubt.  The beauty of the picture and sound of DVD really helps keep this movie as it should be.  The added materials are outstanding.
There are quite a few full length (30 min, give or take) documentaries, 3 in total I believe.  The one I continue to go back onto is the making/thought process of the deleted scenes (which, wonderfully enough, can be seen as part of the movie, if you choose to do so, or you can watch the original) which add to the movie in countless ways.  It gives the movie much more depth, which I found enlightening.. it also adds more feeling to the final scene, and it adds some humor..  the smiling scene is absolutely priceless.
Without a doubt, one of the best DVD's that I've come across, and a must have for anyone who enjoyed the movie at it's onset, and certainly worth a look for anyone else.. especially those who enjoy action movies.",984009600,,1439,4.4
2136385,5,B0002WYTWG,"While the movie doesn't quite have some of the grittiness of the original, this is among not only my top 3 Schwarzenegger films, but one of my favorite of all time.  Several years ago, I had heard rumors of a newer, longer version of T2, but didn't put much stock in it, as a lot of such rumors didn't pan out.  Supposedly, one of the scenes mention was to be a shot of John's foster mother lying dead in a bathtub--obviously the handiwork of the T-1000--but it never came to pass.  I was pleased to see some of the added effects, such as the T-1000s inability to maintain his shape near the end, and it put to rest for me how it was you could tell which was Linda Hamilton and which was her twin sister, before the T-1000 was shot.  Rarely have I seen director's cuts that surpass the original and make it seem a whole new experience.  Only Aliens Special Edition and Star Wars did that for me.  And until this movie, I'd never seen a music video that could employ graphics from the movie as well--example being Guns 'N Roses' Axl Rose being evaluated as a waste of ammunition by the Terminator.  The movie is well-rounded, and I especially liked Sarah's comment about if a machine could learn the value of life, that maybe we could too.",983836800,,1238,4.356521739130435

2136387,4,B0002WYTWG,"Robert Patrick's appearance as Duchovny's replacement on The X-Files reminded me of the  only other time i've seen him, as the evil robot in T2.  An actor without a speaking role is  difficult to assess, so there isn't much to be said about him here.
Schwarzenegger, on the other hand, has a tough job here in trying to match Linda Hamilton's  performance as the concerned mother.  She dominates this film, bringing feminist strengths to  a new intensity.  Her breakout from the hospital must have taken all the energy she possessed  and very nearly overrides the remaining scenes.  Certainly, her conniving tactics in  accomplishing it stick in memory far more than the remainder of the film.  The scene of her  struggle in the foundry seems a bit overblown, but was a necessary climatic build.  Cameron  may have overdone it a bit here, and it's impossible not to wonder how much of it is  Hamilton's own drive to show her toughness that prolonged it.
Arnold turns in a performance superior to most of what he'd done prior to this film.  His  change of character from the earlier Terminator is unquestionably genuine.  It's a forecast of  what he achieves in later films.  Having seen this film prior to watching the original  Terminator made the comparison even more stark.  Never having been a Schwarzenegger fan  before seeing this, it made a convert of me.
This isn't a film to see on a regular basis, but Cameron's abilities deserve more than one  watch.  Clearly, this film is designed for the Schwarzenegger buff.  If Cameron feels Arnold is  worth directing, we must all sit up and take notice.  For that alone, this film is worth adding  to your collection.",982713600,,1668,4.795053003533569
2136388,5,B0002WYTWG,"This the only sequel I can think of which outdid the original.  T-2 is fabulous!
The story is very compelling, with Arnold as the good guy after being his malevolent best in the predecessor.  The first conflict between him on the Harley Davidson vs. Robert Patrick in the White Freightliner gets the heart pumping and the action keeps going.
Unlike T-1, this has some surprisingly humorous moments, from the ""Bad to the Bone"" music when Arnold first appears as a biker, the T-1000 comparing himself to a silver mannequinn, and the best of all - trying to understand why he just cannot go around killing people by responding ""Of course, I am a Terminator.""
Others commented on the additions this disc contains.  I also disliked the inability to move past promotional items.  But this is sure a worthwhile addition to any video collection.",982368000,,837,4.8321678321678325
2136389,5,B0002WYTWG,"Over a period of years I have heard how some people have come to regard the Second Terminator as the better film between the two, but I firmly disagree.  The Terminator is an original work, that represents both the top in action movies and a model for all action movies to follow.  Schwarzenegger puts on an amazing performance as the no-mercy machine sent back into time to kill the leader of the human resistance, setting himself firmly in action movie history.  Other opinions have regarded this movie as being simply violence, but I think that the violence is adequate when comparing it to the plot.

The menus are loaded with FX, and the main part of the special features is set up as scene selections. You choose from over 30 chapters of text/video features, which include everything from production notes to video clips of the ride at universal studios theme park. The film has 3 versions, including the original version and the special editon(this version does not include the Future Sara ending like the VHS release, instead this scene is part of the special features section)
The special edition version does contain several added scenes, including the dream sequence with Kyle. And the disc also includes an audio/video test to calibrate your television and your sound system for optimal performance. My only gripe is that the sound quality is not as good as I had hoped. It of course sounds better than Pro Logic, but does not have the same quality on the DTS track as you might find on Gladiator. But the picture quality is darned good, and I take back everything I have said in the last review about this movie being a waste of money. The price could be a few dollars cheaper, but overall it is a good buy.

2136392,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 is arguably the best science fiction action thriller ever made.  The film features landmark special effects that have rarely if ever been equaled since its release in 1991.  In keeping with the film's over-the-top, WAY better than it has to be philosophy, the 2 DVD set breaks new ground, and stands alone as the most impressive DVD bundle ever released.
The incredible computer generated effects of Terminator 2 often overshadow the other elements that help make this a great movie.  The more ""traditional"" effects (notably the chase, nuclear explosion, and furnace scenes) are also of high quality and complexity.  These sequences are painstakingly detailed, and contribute to the film's intensity and sense of realism.
While the story itself is fairly simple, and the final outcome of the film is predictable, the plot is complex and engaging.  There are enough unexpected twists along the way, as well as significant character development, to make the predictability of the ending less of a detraction.  The Special Edition improves upon this further, by explaining how the T-101 is capable of ""character development"" at all, and by filling in gaps in the story that were removed in the theatrical release for ""pacing"" reasons.
The quality of the DVD production is nothing short of amazing.  The film transfer is extremely clean, and there are numerous audio options.  Also, the shear quantity of extra material included in this package is staggering.  The extras are a mixture of video footage, commentaries, stills, and text.  The DVD medium itself has been maximally utilized.  Menu transitions feature complex animation sequences with seamlessly integrated sound effects.  Traversing the menus is a fully immersive experience.
As if all of this weren't enough, the DVD case and collector's booklet come enveloped in an Aluminum case reminiscent of the silvery bad guy himself.  While not especially significant by itself, the unique protective metal sleeve is consistent with and symbolic of the extravagant materials contained within.
The single black mark on this otherwise flawless DVD set is the ""Artisan"" commercial shown when disk 2 starts up.  This commercial can not be skipped, and fast forwarding is disabled while it is playing.  You are absolutely stuck with watching it, which is pretty tacky.

2136394,5,B0002WYTWG,"If you're like me and have been a James Cameron or ""Terminator"" fan for, like, ever, then you gotta see this!  I originally saw this film in the theater when I was 11 years old, after only recently watching the original ""Terminator.""  I was blown out of my mind by the ground-breaking special effects, the epic scope of the story, and the all-too human side of the film.  That's what always gets me about James Cameron films, I think.  Not only does he have action sequences to appeal to the larger audience, but his view of the human condition is always touching and unique.
You've gotta watch the Ultimate Edition.  It contains one of my all-time favorite scenes--where Kyle comes to Sarah in a dream sequence, telling her she has to protect their son.  And they really get Michael Biehn in for the cameo!  It's just way too cool.  I'd heard about that scene for years, but I only just got to watch it when I bought the Ultimate Edition DVD.
Complete with an interactive menu, a behind-the-scenes look at the cut scenes, et cetra, et cetera, this is one of the most awesome special edition DVDs I own, and it's one of my all-time favorite films.  Buy it.  It's worth it.

The resistance sends a warrior back as well, to save him. In the first Terminator, Ah-nold (say it right!) was sent back the kill John's mother; in the 2nd one, Ah-nold goes back to protect John from an even nastier machine.  That's how the plot starts at least, however rather then go through with it, halfway into the movie it takes an interesting twist and the three heroes (Ah-nold, Linda Hamilton as John's Mother, and John himself) end up trying to prevent the computer from ever being built. Naturally this leads to an ugly time-travel paradox mess that I won't even try to sort out, but you don't have to get into the particulars to enjoy the movie.  The acting is quite good; this is really the only role that Ah-nold can play really well, because the machine is emotionless, and his is good at it. Hamilton gets a trifle annoying in one scene, and in a few others is just, well, crazy, but other then that she is also fine for the role. Lastly, Edward Furlong is excellent as John Connor, ten years old at this time, and not growing up in the best of environments. Watching the relationship between the boy and the machine really sets this movie apart, and leads to a surprisingly moving conclusion.  And naturally, the real part of an action movie, the special effects and action scenes. The effects are astounding. Even today, ten years after the movie was made, they still look incredible. The highlight is the enemy terminator changing its form, and it seems doubtful that it could ever get more real looking. The action itself is also great, ranging from obligatory car chases to Ah-nold and the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) beating each other up. Every scene ties together well, and action and story shift together seamlessly.  Finally, a word must be said about the music: it is incredible. Composer Brad Fidel created a perfect score for the movie; at times the music sounds totally techno-machine like, for other scenes, notably the journey into the desert, it could almost lull you to sleep. (It sounds bad for an action movie, but it's actually not)  The only bad part of T2, as noted, are the whole twisty time travel dealings and the fact the Hamiltons character gets somewhat annoying once or twice. That aside though, T2 is a superb action movie, blending excellent special effects and action with an interesting and involving plot. And of course, everyone loves Ah-nold.",980035200,,2701,4.750533049040512
2136398,5,B0002WYTWG,"This film is very inventive in terms of story line.  The film is expertly directed and established James Cameron as a real talent.  It is also Cameron's first film to have a strong female character as does all of his works(Sigorney Weaver in ""ALIENS"", Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio in ""THE ABYSS"", Linda Hamilton once again in ""T2: JUDGEMENT DAY"", Jamie Lee Curtis in ""TRUE LIES"" and Kate Winslet to some extent in ""TITANIC"".)  To women who think this movie is a brainless action movie think again.  A woman is signifigant to the future of mankind, a woman kills the Terminator, and a woman outsurvives all of the male co-stars.  Sure, the effects are a little dated and are blown away by the sequels, but this is the one that started it all.",979689600,,740,4.6183206106870225
2136399,5,B0002WYTWG,"""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is mind-blowing and awesome. It's also one of the few sequals that tops the original. In fact, this is even better than the original. It has more excitement, better special effects and action sequences. The ""liquid metal"" special effect is amazing. It's one of the best pieces of special effects I've ever seen in an action or sci-fi flick. The ending kept me on the edge of my seat, and the whole movie just blew me away! It's that thrilling and exciting! There are three classic lines in the movie: ""I'll be back"", {also from the first film} ""Come with me if you want to live"", and best of all, ""Hasta la Vasta, Baby"". Those lines have been quoted, I think, from fans of the ""Terminator"" movies. I recommend this to any movie fan of any movie genre, action/sci-fi included.",979257600,,804,4.590277777777778
2136400,5,B0002WYTWG,"I can't wait for True Lies 2 because Cameron has twice shown himself to be a master of action sequels, first Aliens and then T2.
I found myself almost cackling with maniacal glee as stepped through the almost endless selection of options.  This even surpasses The Abyss as the best DVD package I've seen.
I'll agree that the ""extra-special easter-egg"" edition isn't really something to write home about, since the ending 2029 coda was left off for very good reasons.  I do take issue with the earlier reviewer who said that this suggested Cameron needed to be ""reined in.""  Cameron himself cut those scenes, just as he was the one who cut both Aliens and The Abyss for length.  Cameron knows the marketplace as well as anyone, but he also knows how to package these director cuts better than anyone.",978393600,,799,4.685714285714286

2136402,5,B0002WYTWG,"First off, this DVD sets new standards as to extras for die-hard fans. There's no argument there.  I do want to warn fellow T2 fans though.  The ""Special Edition"" version of the film on this DVD is *NOT* new.  This is the exact same ""Special Edition"" of the film that was released back in 1994 by Live Home Video as a boxed set of the Special Edition on VHS along with a supplemental tape, which included the American trailers (also on the DVD) and ""T2:  More Than Meets the Eye,"" which is also on the DVD.  The only difference in MTMTE is that the credit is given to Showtime, not Live.  If you already own this older Special Edition, and that's all you are interested in, don't buy this DVD.  If you're a die-hard fan, though, who loves the idea of tons of Featurettes, a script on the screen, and, best of all in my opinion, a widescreen version of the Special Edition we saw six or seven years ago, this is still a very good buy for the 30 bucks or so you'll end up paying for it.  Just don't confuse yourself into thinking that this Special Edition is different (other than widescreen) than the original VHS Special Edition because you'll be disappointed.  No, the scene with the T-1000 rubbing John's belongings is *not* restored, nor is the ""old Sarah"" ending.  Those are still on More than Meets the Eye, but not in the film itself. If you're a big T2 fan, you'll love this DVD. If you're a fan that only cares about the Special Edition content, that cares nothing for featurettes, and who already owns the VHS Special Edition, you might as well hang onto the money and wait for T1 to come out on DVD.",978048000,,1609,4.351170568561873
2136403,5,B0002WYTWG,"I am new to DVD having just bought myself a player for the holidays. For gifts I received a bunch of new DVD titles. After watching all my new titles, I must say this:
THIS DVD SETS NEW STANDARDS FOR QUALITY!!
I cannot believe how much is crammed into this AMAZING DVD!
Every DVD I load up now, seems lame because it's missing all the great content that I've gotten used to seeing in this title!
Read other reviews as to what's so great about the content, since I won't repeat it here..
My final word is this, once you've gone through this DVD, you'll be spoiled forever, and be dissapointed with most other DVD titles out there, since very few offer SO MUCH!!
You'd be crazy not to buy this DVD!",977961600,,696,4.28030303030303
2136404,5,B0002WYTWG,"Everyone under the sun has already seen some version of T2 and has their own opinion, so I'll concentrate on the differences between the versions, and the ""Ultimate Edition"" extras.  Let me just say that, IMHO, this is one of the best action movies ever.  Just action, mind you.  Now then:  There are three versions of the film on this DVD.  First you have the original theatrical release, which everybody knows.  Second, the Special Edition - in my opinion, the best version out there.  There are a lot of character development scenes in here, a dream sequence featuring Michael Biehn, a bit where they reset Arnie's CPU to ""learning mode"" and Sarah tries to kill Arnie, and some extra T-1000 effects (little glitches when he starts to lose control of his shape).  These are little things, and it's true that they slow the middle of the movie down, but they make the impact that much stronger when the third act, the blow-everything-up bit, begins.  Truly.  Then, if you can find the ""cheat codes"" specific to your DVD player, there is the ""Ultimate Version"" of the movie, which contains the same extra scenes plus one sequence with T-1000 in John's bedroom and one of the lamest epilogues ever cut at the last minute.  This final sequence is proof that sometimes you need to rein the director in, even when that director is as talented as Cameron.  It makes the whole movie seem insipid and feel-good and it conclusively ends the Terminator saga.  Blech. Now, then, about those DVD extras:  truly amazing.  Just about everything you could imagine is on this disc, viewable as one long program or half-minute segments. There are interviews with everyone who worked on T2, storyboards galore, a full shooting script, behind the scenes shots and montages of all the FX work, trailers in English and Japanese, teasers with views of the Terminator production process, and 3 different ""making of"" videos.  And if you want to watch the ""ultimate version"" scenes on their own (just to see how unneccesary they were), they are in there as well.  All connected by excellent animated menus which are actually the DVD's greatest drawback.  This is cutting edge stuff, so a lot of older players will not be able to handle the menus properly.  You can still get around, but sometimes the buttons don't do what you expect them to.  Also, I think some older DVD players will have problems with the disc's format - to get it all onto one disc, they used dual layering on both sides (I think this is properly called DVD-8, but not quite sure).  If you bought your player three to five years ago, you may want to rent this one first to make sure it will run properly.  All in all, even though I've seen this movie so many times I probably won't watch it too often now, I'm glad I got this.  Watch for the original Terminator to get the Ultimate treatment sometime in Spring 2001.  That one won't have so many extras, though, simply because there isn't as much material available.",977788800,,2962,4.673745173745174
2136405,5,B0002WYTWG,"This DVD has everything you could expect.... well.. almost everything... You have specials, interviews, never seen before scenes (this is really cool), and many other things.... BUT.. you don't have subtitles in other languages, and in my case (I live in Peru) it's crucial, because my family can't watch a movie in pure english.
 Other aspect I dislike is the single layer disc... but I think by the time the DVD was made, double layer technology didn't exist.
 But I don't regret I bought this DVD, the special edition with all the new scenes is just great... I wonder how could they cut the scene when Arnold gets his head open.

2136408,5,B0002WYTWG,"Why should you buy this DVD? If you've seen Terminator 2 you haven't seen it until you've see it this way, and if you haven't seen it then I recommend this to you even more. There is so much material stuffed into this DVD that I couldn't even begin to list it (it would take too long). It takes a two sided disc just to hold it all. All I can say is that Cameron and/or whoever else thought this thing up outdid themselves. This is quite possibly the best DVD I have found so far. With all due respect it should be selling for alot more than it is. The extensive menu system is setup as if you were in Skynet. On side one,where the movie(s) are, you start out in an Endoskeleton factory. On side two, which holds the extra goodies, you can descend into the very core of Skynet itself. For film buffs, there is a ""mini-class"" set up in the data core portion. It takes you through the many phases of the feature filmmaking process for T2. It starts with Camerons account of frantically writing the script and ends with marketing and publicity. VERY informative. Make sure to check out all three documentaries and the japanese trailers while exploring the extras. For those interested in more substantial goodies there is a secret code that you can enter one the first side to access a THIRD version of the movie. (look for roman numerals) The extra scenes in both alternate versions were a pleasant suprise. My jaw dropped when I saw the scene with Reese. To me this movie not only set the milestone for current action/scfi movies, it pounded it in with brutal unhuman force. It was well made, well written, well cast, and very replayable, which is more than I can say for most hollywood films.",977529600,,1692,4.443729903536977

2136411,2,B0002WYTWG,"The best thing that can be said for  *Terminator 2*  (I'll omit the subtitle, if you don't mind)  is that, ten years on, it doesn't look at all dated, which I guess is pretty impressive for a sci-fi/action flick.  The worst that can be said for it is much the same thing:  this film, in my mind, more than any other, really got the  ""action-films-that-look-like-animation""  movement rolling.  Just in case we didn't get it in  *The Abyss*, director James Cameron pours on even more liquid mercury in this film, to the point where we're drowning in it.  This movie cost a staggering amount of dollars, and it shows:  it's all special effects, and very little else.  But there's something worse:  the real subtext behind all this sturm and drang seems to be the need to not only SPEND money, but EARN a hell of a lot of it.  Think of some other blockbusters that preceeded this one:  *Star Wars*, *Raiders of the Lost Ark*, to name just two.  Of course Lucas and Spielberg wanted to make money, but they also seemed to have enjoyed making their movies.  There's nothing in Cameron's film that suggests anyone involved had the slightest bit of fun.  (In fact, Linda Hamilton is encouraged to act like a linebacker with  'roid rage . . . but in a thoroughly humorless way.)  *Terminator 2*  is an incessant barrage of setpieces and effects that frantically try to astound the audience -- with only fitful success, in my opinion.  Bigger the splash, the bigger the cash.  This movie's most recent offspring includes films like  *Mission Impossible: II*, *The Phantom Menace*, *The Matrix*, even *Gladiator* . . . all huge moneymakers, all resembling computer animated cartoons rather than movies, all BAD.  Noisy messes, every one.  *Terminator 2*  may very well be to blame for the sad state of action pictures today.
By the way -- before I sign off, I'd like to say that I much preferred the original  *Terminator*, not only because it was a better-written movie, but also because the Terminator himself was a killer villain.  I knew I was in trouble with  *T2*  when Ahnold appears, for no discernable reason, naked in the opening scene with that godawful  *Bad to the Bone*  thumping in the background.  Scenes like that have all the resonance of a  *Married With Children*  episode. . . .",977184000,,2288,4.703797468354431

Sound and video are ""reference quality"" for your home theater system which means, folks, it doesn't get any better than this!

Next, I must give praise about the excellent picture quality and awesome sound.  The picture transfer on this DVD is great.  Crystal clear.  Nice and sharp.  And then...there's the sound.  Boy I tell, you, the sound on this DVD rocks!  If you have a great setup, you'll really appreciate the 5.1 and DTS sound on this one.

In all honesty, I recommend this particular version VERY HIGHLY.

I would also recomend this to those who have a DVD player without the high end system setup, becuase the just the movie and exras that come with it are worth the price alone.

2136428,4,B0002WYTWG,"Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about mankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 played by Schwarzenegger who is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps breaks Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two.",974160000,,1428,5.1068376068376065
2136429,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is one of those DVD's that you wait for with bated breath. I was very fortunate to get a copy for 15 in an on-line auction. This was to be my first DTS soundtrack DVD and it gave me the excuse to buy the Videologic DTS sound system. It was with eargerness that I placed the DVD into my player and cranked up the sound system. Right from the menus it's apparent that this is something never seen before even surpassing the excellent DVD of 'The Abyss'. The DTS sound test and specially-created THX logo's are beyond what can be described. The quality of the film is excellent. The terminator's metal bofy gleams and the laser shots are crisp and well defined. The sound is beatifully separated and  is the best of all the DVD's that I have played. The three versions of the film all have their plusses and minusses but the seamless branching between them is excellent. Then of course, there is a second disc full of the 'extras' that DVD buyers have come to expect. However, these are more. Trailers, documentaries, video segments. All are good quality and give the viewer full immersion in the Terminator world. When the DVD is used in a PC there is a novelty factor in being able to watch the movie and have the script side-by-side to compare. This is undoubtedly the best DVD around as an all-round package. It's just a shame that other DVD producer's don't take the time to try and give the same treatment to other great films.",974073600,,1435,4.477099236641221

The DVD is perhaps the most comprehensive edition ever, with one exception that I'm surprised no-one has mentioned; the menu system is terrible. Hidden buttons, no explanations and incorrect instructions just add to the nightmare of navigating this disc. Once you get around this extremely obscure method you can get access to a lot of good material on the making of the disc. It's just a pity that the Commentary is a collection of audio clips from the cast & crew and not just one or two people doing it.
Still, it's worth getting and I'm glad I did.",973900800,,767,4.485714285714286

This time round the terminator returns from the future to save a boy (Edward Furlong) and his mother (Linda Hamilton) from a murderous shape changing robot. Non stop action, dazzling visual effects and acceptable performances make this a classic and  the role of the terminator is probably what Arnold Schwarznegger will be best remembered for.

2136432,5,B0002WYTWG,"As I opened my Amazon.com box revealing a shiny outer metal casing for this DVD, I knew I was in for something special.  This ""Ultimate Edition"" impressed me even before opening the plastic wrapping!  Soon, I slid off the metal T2 casing revealing a beautiful 2 disc DVD package.  The graphics on the outer casing and on the discs themselves are quite creative.  The booklet is also impressive....30 pages of photos and interesting facts concerning James Cameron, his crew and the film.  It also has a detailed list of the chapters and a list with information on the restored footage.  OK...so far I have a huge smile on my face, and I haven't even popped the DVD into my player yet.  By the way, if you plan to keep the booklet inside the DVD case, make sure you close it tightly!  This booklet is so thick, you'll have problems keeping the package closed!  Anyway, I finally pop in Disc 1.  The animated graphics are terrific!  Disc 1 contains the theatrical release of the film, the special edition with restored footage, and the magic ""easter egg"" ending.  It also gives you an assortment of audio options including Dolby Digital 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0.  You also have the choice of audio commentary by 26 cast and crew members!  What I thought was really great about the commentaries was that the name of the person talking is shown on the screen with their credit, so you always know who is talking without getting confused.  That was a pleasant surprise.  You also have the choice of English subtitles and ""Mission Profiles"", which are biographies of many cast and crew members.  You can also jump to any scene you want with an impressive ""timeline"" graphic.  Being THX certified, this disc also contains a THX set-up.  OK...so lets talk about the DVD.  I decided to watch the ""Special Edition"".  After a very impressive new THX logo, I sat back and watched the film.  Instantly, the sound was top notch.  If you have a subwoofer, you may have to make sure that anything hanging on your walls are securely fastened.  The remastering job on this film is amazing.  The stereo separation, the ambience, vocals and music all sound incredible.  This film really set a new standard for sound design when it was first released, and this DVD compliments the sound department to the fullest.  You are thrown into a surround sound environment that is addicting and thrilling. Even those with simple 2 speaker set-ups will be happy, but those with advanced surround systems will have some explaining to tell the neighbors.  This DVD is a great test for your system.  A true audiophonic, stereophonic thrill.  OK...enough about the sound...what about the picture?  Well, the picture is also superb, with incredible detail and beautiful deep blacks.  Color saturation is beautiful with deep blues throughout the film.  The transfer is incredibly clean.  Can you believe that I can STILL see the wires suspending Arnolds motorcycle as he jumps into the canal!!?? (Chapter 21, I believe.)  Anyway, the widescreen presentation of T2 is definitely the ""ultimate DVD experience.""  **By the way, SLOWLY type in 8-2-9-9-7 in the main menu AFTER you choose ""Special Edition"".  This accesses the secret ""Extended Special Ediion.""  (different DVD players may require you to press 'enter' after each number, while others may not.)**  OK...let's talk about disc 2 which contains all the supplemental material.  The opening graphic animation is really great.  This animation brings you to the main menu.  The main menu is subdivided into 3 sections....""Information Programs"" which has 3 featurettes, ""Making of T2"", ""T2, More then meets the eye"", and ""The making of T2 3D"".  The second section, ""Visual Campaigns"", has a ""Teaser Trailer"", two ""Theatrical Trailers"", and a ""T2 Special Edition Trailer"".  The thrid section, The ""Data Hub"", has all other supplemental material.  This includes 574 still frames of the final shooting script, original storyboard sequences, a bunch of video sequences including videos of James Cameron, the co-writer, the effects designer, stunt coordinator, interviews with cast and other crew members and a BUNCH of other stuff that will keep you watching until T3 is released!  The ""Data Hub"" also contains an impressive graphical behind the scenes story of T2, or you can choose a video featurette with behind the scenes footage....both very impressive.  For you PC people, you can also watch the film while reading the script and looking at the storyboards.  You can also link to online T2 websites.  I won't ruin all the surprises of this disc, but I recommend you to experiment with this disc...there are a few other surprises that I won't go into detail about.  In conclusion, I want to applaud everyone involved in the making of this DVD, especially the Creative Supervisor Van Ling.  It is simply one of the BEST DVD's available and gives everyone a reason to own a DVD player.  Much time was spent in producing this package, and it is worth every penny.  Full of surprises, top notch audio and video quality with THX certification, and an attractive outer case too!  This is what all future ""ultimate editions"" should be compared to, because ""Terminator 2-The Ultimate DVD Edition"" is why DVD was created.  I recommend this DVD to EVERYONE....especially to those who are DVD fanatics, fans of the Terminator films and/or James Cameron, or you simply want to 'show off' your home entertainment system.  Buy this DVD package and enjoy!",972864000,,5468,4.941822173435785
2136433,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is a fantastic movie if you have a big screen TV and a DTS set up. I am lucky to have a 22 year old son to set these things up for me and they sound really great with very clear shot gun shells hitting the ground and bullets bouncing off police cars, and my favorite was the helicopter chasing a truck under a freeway. The sound there was extremely real! Being able to look at how the movie was made, and the tricks used to make it all happen, will keep me busy for a long time. If you like ""blow 'em up"" movies (I do) this is perfect! The metal case is very cool too!",972691200,,573,3.864406779661017
2136434,5,B0002WYTWG,"In the rare pantheon of sequels that are just as good as -- if not, better than -- the original, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is in limited but good company. Nearly a decade after leaving his stamp with the first film, James Cameron returned to the property that put him on the map (perhaps with tail between legs following the disappointing release of ""The Abyss"" a few years prior). With original players Linda Hamilton and, of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action, Cameron co-wrote a script that expanded upon the simple premise of the original film while adding more social commentary and even more action than before.

While our heroin from the first film, Sarah Connor (Hamilton) rots away in a maximum security mental institution, her young son and future savior of mankind, John (a fresh-faced Edward Furlong), is roaming the streets of Los Angeles, blasting some GNR whilst robbing ATMs. Meanwhile, the war against the machines rages on in the future, and as such, a newer and deadlier Terminator with shape-shifting abilities -- the T-1000, as played by a stone-cold serious Robert Patrick -- is sent back in time to crush that little squirt John Connor before he leads all of humankind to victory. It's hard not to imagine the resistance chanting ""Yes, we can!"" while the machines retort with ""We built it!"" Anyway, as before, a protector for Connor is sent, only this time it's a re-programmed version of the same would-be Terminator that originally tried to kill his mother. And thus, Arnold is back.

""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is notable for a lot of things, but what really makes it stand out is its stunning visuals effects. As one of the first films to utilize CGI in a big way, it simultaneously closed the door on the dominance of practical effects in the '80s while opening the door for the likes of ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Matrix"" and, of course, ""Avatar."" Using the T-1000 as the film's guinea pig, Cameron makes us believe liquid metal can come to life and stalk us. Even as technology has advanced, the CGI in the film is remarkable and somehow manages to look better than the CGI-heavy fodder of today.

But special effects aside, the film is truly a roller-coaster ride of epic proportions. While admittedly not as tightly paced as its predecessor, the follow-up is chock full of dizzying action, dazzling set-pieces and big and bold ideas about the future. Amidst all of this lies a disarming sense of fun and humor, vis  vis the interplay between Schwarzenegger and young Furlong. To counter this, Hamilton steps it up as Rambo with sweater-meat. Her turn as the hardened and focused soldier is a natural progression from where we last saw her, and thankfully, Hamilton is up for the task.

As far as big-budget blockbusters go, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" sits at the top of the heap. Very few films have come along in its time that are as truly epic and entertaining as this. With Schwarzenegger in his prime and Cameron at the top of his game, this is a no-brainer. One of the few ""must-see"" sequels in history. This one truly gives its predecessor a run for its money. While the franchise laid dormant for a good decade, Hollywood couldn't resist, and two sequels as well as a TV series followed. To be sure, though, ""Terminator 2"" is the end all, be all follow-up and a perfect companion piece to the original. Like chocolate and peanut butter, or plastique and burly beef, if you prefer.

2136435,5,B0002WYTWG,"The special edition DVD is simply a must have in anyone's collection. Three featurettes are included; one for the original version, one for the special edition and one for the Universal Studios 3D show. It would have been nice to see the whole 3D show, but I guess you have to go to Universal Studios to see it. A 50-chapter supplement composed of text notes inter-cut with interviews and special features. Design, pre-production, locations, training, weapons, sound, editing, publicity only touches the information given. You name it they covered it. I especially liked the sound chapter where they broke down the various sound elements so you can hear them isolated from each other. The audio commentary is very good coming from just about every cast and crew member involved. Subtitles are given so you know who is talking. Some of the material is reused though. For example, some of the audio commentary is from interviews used in the featurettes. Sixteen deleted scenes are added in the special version, 18 for the extended special version. To get the extended version enter the roman numbers seen to the right of the main menu; they look odd, but trust me they are roman numerals. I already had T2 on DVD, but the special edition, just for the delete scenes alone, makes it more than worth replacing it if you already have it. The extra scenes give extra depth to the story and the characters. Most bonus features become boring an initial viewing, but I think the ones on this DVD can easily be seen again and again. Overall, if you were stuck on a desert isle, this would be the DVD to have.",971136000,,1598,4.710714285714285
2136436,5,B0002WYTWG,"This DVD is awesome!  The sound and picture is phenomenal and it's worth every penny.  My one drawback (and I'm hoping someone can contact me at jusjams@home.com for a little help) is that the audio comes in 3 versions: Dolby Digital EX 5.1, Dolby Stereo 2 channel and finally DTS-ES which requires the decoder for the 3rd surround channel making it 6.1 channels.  I am unable to get my DVD player to play this version even though I don't have the latest set-up of 6.1 channels.  I'm told that this new format is backwards compatible with the 5.1 set-ups but it doesn't seem so with mine. Just the intro with the THX logo is enough to sell this DVD delight where you see Arnie blowing the T2 title apart and the metal starts to melt like the t-1000 and forms together as the THX logo!, but I wish I could run the DTS-ES version where the DTS logo and the CD explodes into a zillion pieces (like in the theatre runs)Mine only shows with no volume.  I still would recommend this DVD very much for all the extras and the mere fact that it's still one of the very best friggin' movies out there to date. (same level as Matrix) No regrets!

2136438,5,B0002WYTWG,"I read through the reviews here and came across with one that explained on how to key in a code to see the extended special edition, which is 2 minutes and 43 seconds longer. It has an additional scene of T1000 searching around John Conner's room and an alternative ending where you can see old Sarah Connor. Anyway, that particular review stated that to unlock the extended version, you need to key in 82297 at the special edition menu. I was not the same code as mine. Mine is 82997. So, I figure that those of you who got the DVD could also have different codes. Anyway, it's quite easy to figure it out. When you select the special edition, you will see another submenu. On the right side of the sub-menu, you can see some kind of a VCR button symbols. They are actually roman numeric codes. A square and a rectangle is actually a ""I"", a triangle pointing down is actually a ""V"" and 2 small triangle pointing up and down and towards each other is actually an ""X"", So, mine was ""VIII II IX IX VII"". If you key in correctly, the codes will change to ""The Future Is Not Set"".

2136442,5,B0002WYTWG,"Of course you've all seen the movie (and if you haven't, what the hell are you thinking? ), so let's get straight to the DVD itself.  The second you pop it in, you know you're looking at the most insane, overblown DVD ever released just from the crazy menu intro.  A lot of the best movies ever made were cheaper than the menus on this disc.  And you get just about everything you could possibly want in a T2 DVD and then a whole lot more.  Or, rather, you learn everything you'd ever want to know about T2, but the disc doesn't have one of the most obvious features fans would have wanted-- a Cameron/Schwarzenneger commentary track.  Yeah, there's that crazy 26-people track with subtitles so you can tell who's talking, and both Cameron and Schwarzenneger appear on it, but it's obviously just pieced together from various interviews and documentaries (many of which appear elsewhere on the disc).  As nice as it is, the best commentaries are the ones that make you feel like you're watching the movie with the people who made it, like the one on Anchor Bay's Evil Dead II special edition.  And when you think T2, you think James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenneger, so their voices should have taken precedence.  Everything else is as good as you'd expect, with three versions of the film all presented in fantastic picture and sound (DD or DTS).  The Special Edition version adds some interesting moments (a scene focusing on Miles Dyson really adds to the significance of his character) but also some lame ones (the Kyle Reese dream sequence is melodramatic and drags on way too long).  The hidden third cut, however, just adds two needless scenes, including a totally ludicrous alternate ending.  But anyway, it's one of the best DVD purchases around, and everybody who owns a player should probably buy it just as a reference of how thorough the format can be.  It's a five-star disc, no doubt about it, but they really should have gotten more of Arnold and Jim.",970272000,,1968,4.688953488372093

2136446,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is the must have disc for anyone wondering what the hype is over DVD.  Artisan has done a bang up job on this ultimate edition, which contains  both the original theatrical version and the special edition which has  multiple deleted scenes. The menu screen alone is exhaustive and  imaginative, replicating the interior of the Cyberdine.  Every aspect of  the film is covered extensively from preproduction through marketing of the  film with interviews with the cast and crew. There's also a ""making  of"" the T2-3D attraction that's housed at both Universal Studios in  Hollywood and Florida.-No video here, simply pictures and text.  The DVD  also comes with a booklet (much needed to break everything down) that has  chapter listings for both the original and special edition, and a  collectors metal slip case that wraps around the case. The movie, after  almost ten years, holds up really well, with the special effects still  something to marvel at. Even the THX opening has been  ""Terminatorfied"".  If you're on the fence about it, trust me,  it's worth every penny. It's too bad all DVD's weren't approached with such  care.

2136447,5,B0002WYTWG,"This DVD contains almost the same content as the Pioneer laserdisc box set  released a few years ago.  The laserdisc was considered by many to be the  best LD ever made mainly because of the huge amount of supplementary  material.  This DVD version finally brings this excellent content to the  public in a much more affordable price (the laserdisc cost over  $100).
The mammoth supplementary section contains thousands of  still-frames, (some text-only, some text-with-pictures, some linked with  video/audio segments), that chronologically details the making of the film  such as pre-production, casting, visual effects, marketing, promotion, etc.  Described as ""6 hours of supplements"" on the disc case, in truth  it will take you much longer to absorb all the content.
The Guns &  Roses promo music video that was included in the laserdisc's supplements is  not included on this DVD.  The DVD merely contains still shots of the  video.  (This amusing video shows Arnold carrying a gun that is hidden in a  box of roses while attending a concert by, well, Guns & Roses.)
The  DVD does include the wonderfully edited promo documentary ""The Making  of T2"".  This little gem WAS NOT on the laserdisc.  (Hurray!)
There  is a dazzling DVD-ROM feature that lets you view the movie, the script, and  storyboard diagrams all on the same screen. (The script can also be found  in the supplementary section, but it is very hard to navigate through it  due to inadequate chapter stops).
There are some ""easter eggs""  (hidden features) on this DVD as well, one of them is an ""extended  special edition"" of the movie that includes 2 scenes omitted in the  special edition -- a scene where the T1000 searches the boy's bedroom, and  an alternate ending set 30 years into the future, featuring an aged Sarah  Conner.  The laserdisc also had these deleted scenes, but this DVD lets you  view the deleted scenes as part of the movie.  Another easter egg is a  collection of Japanese trailers (look for a tiny Japanese flag on one of  the menu screens).
The only troubling thing about this DVD is that the  packaging includes a note saying, ""Due to the advance features, some  DVD players may have navigational problems.  But it should not affect your  enjoyment in using this disc.""  It's troubling because this sounds  like it's something that SHOULD affect my enjoyment.

Terminator 2 was a big box office smash that made a  whole lot of money at the box office. The last time a film had a great  amount of impact on me before this film was Star Wars back in 1977.14 years  later,I'm sitting in a movie theater watching Terminator 2. This time I was  in hyperdrive. This film keeps you going and going and going. But there wrere  some answers that needed to be explained. Why does The Terminator act a  little human in the film? Where there some scenes in this movie that were  eliminated that provided the answers to this film. That's why it's a good  thing this film was finally rereleased on VHS in a special edition  director's cut. Of course that's nothing compared to the DVD.In my  opinion,the best DVD since The Matrix,Terminator 2:Judgment Day has enough  extra goodies to knock anyone,or some people out of orbit. I rented the DVD  not too long ago,and I really enjoyed it. It provides plenty of  entertainment for even the person who has seen this a thousand times  before.",969062400,,1183,4.483568075117371
2136456,5,B0002WYTWG,"I agree with most of the reviews posted here. The packaging of the DVD is  sleek and unique, the menus are funky and consistent with the film, and the  image and sound quality of the transfer is second-to-none.  What turned me  off is the supplemental material describing the making of the movie. This  stuff usually fascinates me, but after reading about it on this disc, I  feel qualified to go out and film ""T3: War and Peace"" myself. The  information is presented on hundreds of screens of text which take hours to  plow through, sparsely highlighted with live interviews and examples of  what they are describing. Occasionally there is the truly interesting  nugget of trivia or clever Hollywood trick explained, but mostly it is just  descriptions of camera apertures, lighting angles, etc.  Exceptions to this  are the chapters explaining the T-1000 and T-800 special effects.  But on  the good side, it certainly gives you a firsthand idea of all the work that  goes into making a movie.  The name of this DVD should be ""Everything  (and we mean EVERYTHING) You've Ever Wanted to Know About T2 (but were  afraid to ask!)""  Still, everything else on the disc rocks!",968976000,,1172,4.8232323232323235

The picture is GREAT and  the Metal case really adds to the overall package. The booklet in the DVD  is cool. It has lots of information about the movie. Own a DVD? Get it.

2136459,5,B0002WYTWG,"Okay, I wanted to get the original edition on Amazon, and then I saw this  Ultimate Edition. I didn't know there was a difference, so I checked it out  and what I saw made me wish it came out sooner! I got the DVD the day it  came out and then I played it all night long! I played the Theatrical  Version, then I played the Special Edition, and then I checked out all the  biographies of Arnold, Linda, Eddie, Robert, and James Cameron. I then  thought I was cheated but I first flipped the other side and I got all the  other great features. So many great features you need both sides. I checked  out the Trialers and Teasers, the Documentries, the supplementary features,  the story boards, and I read some fo the script, which is a great addition.  I then read the booklet over and over. And after seeing the Special  Eddition, this is now my favorite movie!!!!",968457600,,864,4.3375

2136461,4,B0002WYTWG,"This is one of the best action/science fiction films I have ever seen. One  of James Cameron's best collaborators is Arnold Schwarzenegger and that is  well proven here. This film is, in my opinion, light years better then the  original Terminator in every aspect. Cameron is great at creating action  films with elements of human drama. The ending is a bit cheesy and over the  top but not enough to make this a bad film. The acting is pretty good. I'ld  say the best performance is given by Linda Hamilton as the hardened and  determined Sarah Connor. The music is okay. The special effects are  terrific. The DVD is great and loaded to the gills with extras. I  particularly like the ""making of"" documentary which includes  interviews with Arnold, Cameron, and other cast and crew members. The  documentary also shows the process behind the computer and make-up effects.  The picture quality is fantastic. If you don't have this DVD, get it!",968371200,,944,4.795031055900621
2136462,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is the most feature packed DVD I own!
Terminator 2 THE ULTIMATE  EDITION DVD actually has 3 different versions of the movie; the original  theatrical release lasting 136 minutes, the special edition version lasting  153 minutes and an extended special edition clocking in at 155 minutes and  43 seconds which is accessed by an ""Easter Egg"" discussed  below.
You can access the extended special edition version by selecting  special edition from the menu and then entering 82297 on your remote's  numeric keypad.  You may have to press ""enter"" after each number  on certain DVD players.  An easier method is to just select title number 3  from your remote.
The picture quality and sound quality are top-notch on  this DVD and it is my top choice for showing off my system to friends and  family!  It includes Dolby Digital 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1 ES and Dolby Digital 2.0  mixes.  The EX and ES designations refer to a new standard that includes a  sixth channel of sound that is designed to emanate from a rear center  speaker.  I have a 5.1 setup, so I couldn't test this feature, but it's  nice to know it's there.
This release comes in two formats; either a  DVD-18 disc or two DVD-9 Discs.  The DVD-18 is a double-sided, double layer  disc and contains the entire 6 hours of material on one disc that needs to  be flipped and the DVD-9 is a single-sided, double-layer disc which has the  material on two discs.  Don't worry, the content on both versions is the  same.  The two disc version might be preferable for DVD changer users.  Due  to manufacturing limitations with the newer DVD-18 format, the DVD-9's were  created to better meet demand.
One really cool thing about this title is  that the trailers for Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS play according to which  audio setting is selected.  These are nice to demo your system with!  Also,  the THX trailer at the beginning was customized for T2 as a bonus.
If you  love this movie, get this version now!  It has enough bonus materials to  warrant a purchase even if you already own the previous release on DVD.  This is an awesome special edition that betters the Laser Disc special  edition at a quarter of the list price!  There are English and Japanese  trailers, 700 storyboards, a 26 person audio commentary, making of T2 and  T2 3D featurettes and DVD-ROM material as well.
Last, but not least, you  get ""THX Optimode,"" a tool to properly adjust your home theater  audio and video settings for optimum enjoyment.  I recommend Video  Essentials or Avia Guide to Home Theater DVDs for critical system  adjustment, but this is a great tool for free!  To access ""THX  Optimode,"" select ""Sensory Control,"" click your remote's  left button and click on the highlighted THX on the endoskeleton's  skull.
This is a great DVD with my highest recommendation!",968371200,,2805,4.711618257261411
2136463,5,B0002WYTWG,"Sure, it might not be a 100% logical at all times, but when you watch this  movie, you realise that you don't really care. It's incredibly cool, and  well done. It's really sad to see that some of the movies that are being  made today can't match the special effects in this movie. Come on! Almost  ten years? Well, Cameron sure knows what he's doing, and Schwarzenegger was  born a robot. :)",968371200,,392,4.388888888888889
2136464,5,B0002WYTWG,"Too often, production studios fail to take advantage of the revolutionary  technologies available with the advent of the DVD. This is not the case  with Terminator 2: Judgment Day - The Ultimate DVD Edition. Not by a long  shot.
This release should set the standard for all collector's editions  to come. Including both the theatrical release and an extended new  ""Director's"" cut -- complete with fantastic re-mixed 5.1 surround  -- fans can't lose. Don't like the new version? Stick with what works. Want  to see what was left on the cutting-room floor? Have a look at the new  one.
Director's cuts often suck. They make you realize why the  ""new"" scenes were deleted in the first place. This release is not  one of them.
Watch it. Often. It is, after all, the ""Ultimate""  DVD edition. Really..",968284800,,796,4.779411764705882
2136465,5,B0002WYTWG,"Again, this is another movie I'm not going to try to sell you on.  If you  are considering buying this DVD version, you probably already know it and  love it.  Believe me, you will not be disappointed.  The video and sound  transfers are amazing - five stars to both - and the extra features will  keep you busy for days.  The only video flaws I saw were in the Special  Edition, when an out-take scene was added, lines are noticable across the  screen for a split second.  Also, I was a little disappointed that the SE  cut didn't include the scene where the T-1000 feels John's belongings in  the boy's room, but it is certainly not a necessity, and so much was  included anyway.  Since the disc contains both cuts of the film, purists  can watch their original, and interested parties can see how many of the  extra scenes fit into an extended version, a version that actually works  quite well, if it is a little over-long.  My only complaints with this disc  are the packaging.  Two versions of the Ultimate Edition exist - one that  has one disc, and one that has two.  The two-disc version comes in a  normal, thin case, just like the regular, but because there is an extra  plastic flap to hold the second disc, you cannot put the massive book  inside the case.  Instead, you have to kind of stuff it in the metal,  exterior case, which can be a bit of a pain.  Other than that, this DVD  will satisfy the fans and the extra-features junkies for a long time.",968284800,,1466,4.382022471910112

2136467,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is why they invented DVD. You take a great movie and you jam it so  full of extras that it takes you days to watch it all. You tweek the sound  so it blasts through your surround speakers as if you were watching it all  over again in the multiplex. You add additional footage in a special  edition that extends the movie by  twenty minutes. You gather ALL the stars  of the film and interview them about the process of making the movie and  everything that surrounded it. You would then have a DVD like TERMINATOR 2  THE ULTIMATE DVD.
In my previous reveiws, I was often dissapointed when  good films weren't given the tweaking that I love with the DVD medium. This  is everything I hoped it would be and more. You know the story, now get the  extras. BUY THIS DVD!!!! (and while you are at it, buy it at amazon.com and  save yourself a couple of dollars).",968198400,,861,4.279503105590062
2136468,5,B0002WYTWG,"I already owned the VHS set of the Special Edition when the first DVD  release of T2 hit the streets. I rented it and found that it was just the  theatrical cut. Even though it had superior picture and sound compared to  VHS, I decided to wait until the full cut was released. And, after finally  experiencing the finished product, I can sincerely state that it was well  worth the wait.
 Now I'm able to view both the theatrical and Special  Edition, as well as other deleted scenes. Some of those restorations  include Sarah Connor dream sequence featuring `T1' martyr Kyle Reese, the  garage head surgery, John Connor trying to teach the Terminator to smile,  and several other little moments that add to the movie's suspense and  style.
The picture quality's a little better than my original VHS tape,  which was excellent in itself. The upside to this is I don't have to worry  about the picture quality degrading after endless viewings. It's the sound,  however, that's improved by leaps and bounds. The film starts with opening  demos of both Dolby and THX sound, both of which just blew me away before  the movie's opening sequence even began! It's definitely a big step up from  the VHS edition, which was just above adequate.
Like the Special Edition  DVD release of that other James Cameron gem `The Abyss', `T2 Ultimate  Collection' is jam-packed with extras. Enough to keep a big-time film buff  entertained for hours without ever actually viewing the movie itself. Two  `making of' documentaries, trailers, shooting script, production stills,  and much more. Altogether, over six hours worth of stuff! There's even a  `making of' featurette on the Universal Studios attraction T2 3D. And if  the DVD's extra features weren't enough, also included is a fairly thick  booklet detailing the history and making of the film.
The aluminum  slipcase gives the total package a proper look, but can easily get  scratches, dings, and dents if you're not too careful. Another downside is  that it fits quite loosely over the snap case. If you plan to pull it out  off your shelf for viewing, I strongly suggest you get a good grip on it  first. Or you can just put the slipcase aside and place just the snap case  alone on your DVD shelf.
I hope you enjoy `T2 Ultimate Edition' as much  as I do!

The extra's are a plus but not the  reason for buying this perfect movie. I can't say enough. I LOVE IT.",968112000,,440,4.011494252873563
2136478,4,B0002WYTWG,"I was expecting to see three versions of the film as it was advertised  earlier on when they were feeding the market frenzy to the buying public.  Don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding DVD package, it has all kinds of  extras, literally everything you would want to know about the whole  Terminator 2 film.  All the stuff that was released on the VHS edition back  in 1995 is all here!  Plus a whole lot more!  It gets kind of ridiculous  actually since there is just so much of it.  One thing I do have a  complaint about is the navigational control of the supplemental disc, when  you press a button for a certain area it either takes you to the main menu  or you have to keep pressing the desired button to get you where you want  to go.  That's kind of frustrating and those clever people at Artisan have  put a notice in the DVD package making people aware there may be  difficulties in navigating those controls.  If they knew there were  glitches, than why did they even release all of this in the first place?  Hmmmmm.  I was impressed with the Terminator 2 3D documentary, I have never  seen that attraction at Universal Studios and now I am totally stoked to go  there the next time I go to California.  Another problem with all of this  is the keep case they give you, there is too much stuff for the small  packaging they provide you.  I can't close the keep case and the cheap  aluminum cover is kinda lame.  If you put both discs and booklet in there,  it just doesn't fit.  Why didn't they do the same thing as Independence Day  with a keep case that holds everything? (By the way, Independence Day is  the greatest DVD package made yet next to Fight Club).  I am really glad I  didn't pay the full price that everyone else is having to pay.  Word of  advice, buy these DVD's before they are release, always pre-order since you  save between 10 and 15 percent everytime and you don't feel as bad in  buying your selection if isn't everything that you wanted.  If you're a  huge T2 fan, this DVD is a must have.  If you found the movie  ""amusing"" you'll probably like ID4 or Fight Club a lot better if  you don't own them already.

2136481,3,B0002WYTWG,"The first thing you see when you open the case is a notice from THX  warning that some DVD players may experience ""navigational  difficulties""... their code phrase for saying that they shipped buggy  software.  That's a bad sign, and the notice is accurate because the extra  documentary materials relating to the making of the film would not work at  all on my player.
I was very disappointed, because the making-of  segments were why I paid extra for this fancier edition.  Seems they must  have been on a deadline and rushed out a faulty product.  That's a shame,  because what is there that DOES work is very well done, and of course the  film itself, both versions, looks great on DVD.
So beware, especially if  you don't have a recently-made player.  Unfortunately, there is no mention  of this problem on the outside of the package, or any listing of player  brands that their disc isn't compatible with.  To make sure, you could go  to a store that sells both DVDs and players, then try out this  ""Ultimate Edition"" disc on the same model player that you own at  home.  It's an expensive disc, and there's no reason to spend the extra  cash if the features won't work for you.

That AC-3 LaserDisc version of T2:SE never made it to production, but now the DVD has!!! And when you're lucky enough to have DTS playback you'll be surprised by the quality they out into this movie.

In the case of James Cameron, it was true  of ""The Abyss"", and it's true for T2. The theatrical cut can be  watched on this DVD, but so can the ""Special Edition"" (and if you  pay close attention to the DVD menues, you can unlock an Extended Special  Edition with a different ending...) The Special Edition just makes more  sense than the theatrical version -- there's a lot more dealing with the  CPU that makes the Terminator and SkyNet tick; more family time with Miles  Dyson; and more scenes showing the cruelty (and flaws) of the T-1000. All  in all, it makes the characters face more challenges than in the theatrical  cut, which gives them all more depth and makes for a better picture.",967852800,,797,4.595744680851064

The amount of footage they packed on the 2 DVDs (technically  called side 1 and 2)will shock you. And then the movie. I would watch the  uncut version last to really appreciate the value of the deleted scenes.  Keep the booklet handy to point out the added scenes.

can anyone tell me?",967766400,,185,4.138888888888889
2136492,5,B0002WYTWG,Having already bought about 70 DVD's before i bought this special edition i have seen quite a few of the menu systems before. With the one the is  included with T2 it is absolutly brilliant. It is really colourful and  moves and sounds really good. I was surprised when i found that my copy of  the film was delivered on 2 discs as aposed to the 1 disc that it was meant  to be on. Apart from this small fault the rest makes a really good package  and a brillant buy for anyone who likes this film or just action films.  There are tons of additional features included which can take up hours of  your time sitting through. Of all the films that i own this is definatley  rated very close to the top. I really recommend it to anyone who is  expanding their collection of films or someone who just wants to watch one  of the most fun and exciting movies made again and again.,967766400,,873,4.204819277108434

Not only is T2 a classic movie, which includes great action, amazing  effects, a well written script and Schwarzenegger at his best; but also a  great menu system, outstanding extras and 3, YES 3 versions of the great  film on offer (the third is a Easter egg, so you'll have to choose title 3  while the film has been started and you'll get the extra, extra extended  version).
I won't go into the story as everybody knows the score, but  this is probably James Cameron's best work to date, a truly great film,  which has not been effected by time. What are you waiting for, go and buy  it now.",967680000,,671,4.26984126984127
2136494,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 1 was a great movie but after seeing T2 you can easily see the difference between the visuals between the two.  The DVD features are packed into this thing.  The commercial on TV mentioned 3 versions on the CD:  Theatrical (120 mins), Special (156 mins), and a Hidden Alternate.  I have no idea what this is.  All I know is that I'm gonna sit here and play with this remote until I find it on this DVD.  If any of you know anything about this hidden alternate stuff or have found it, email me:  socko130@hotmail.com
One of the greatest things about T2 is that you have no idea at the beginning (unless your friend tells you before you see it) which terminator is the protector and which is the killer.  Both of them kick some butt at the beginning.  When Arnold gets his clothes it was a little giveaway that he was the good guy.  Other than that, it's pretty cool all the way up to that scene at the video arcade when both terminators whip out their guns and you have no idea whats gonna happen until Arnold says ""duck"" or whatever.  Classic.  James Cameron has yet to make a crappy film.  NOT THE ULTIMATE EDITION DVD, BUT THE ULTIMATE DVD.",967680000,,1153,4.356807511737089

The T2 soundtrack totally rocked my system and will continue to do so each and every time I place it in my player!!! With all of the added features included on this disc, I look to be tied up for quite some time trying to navigate through it all.

There is however some  scenes, including the original ending, in the making of T2.  The sound is  good but sometimes I think the sound on my laserdisc is superior.  The  picture is also good.

Arnold gives a brilliant performance and shows why he  is the best action star in hollywood.  There is a good supporting cast, but  Arnold is what makes the movie.  Arnold travels back in time and has now  been ""reprogrammed"" to be a good terminator.  He is the protector  of John Connors against a more advanced terminator.  Sarah Connors (Linda  Hamilton) plays a much tougher role than in the first movie, but she gives  a good performance.  The special effects are great and so are the action  sequences.  I recommend that you go to Universal Studios and check out the  Terminator 3d show.  It is the bomb.  It got me very pumped up about T3.  Lets hope Linda Hamilton will come back to T3, but if she doesn't, its okay  because Ah-nuld is back!",967593600,,840,4.554054054054054

This DVD version gives you an overwhelming  amount of extras, 3 different versions of the film, 3 ""making of  "" featuretts, cast and crew commentaries, interviews and much more.

The regular version, the special edition with all kinds of extra footage, and a 3rd hidden extended special edition with another 3 minutes of footage and a different ending. DTS sound, 5.1, 2.0 all dolby sound, all the time. It's all here.
THe extras, oh my god the extras. There are tons and tons of featurettes, about really every aspect of the movie. They are all laid out in these cool cyberdyne systems menus that are really fun to navigate. The extended special footage is here to view seperately, since on side one you have to ""unlock"" it (type the judgement day date in with your keypad after you select special edition but before you start the movie, a quote saying the future is not set will come on the screen).
There is a commentary, but it's not that great. It's quotes from all the featurettes pulled together so it really sounds like a production instead of a few guys sitting around watching and talking about the movie. This is the one soft spot on the DVD.
This is Cameron's best flick, and it gets the royal treatment here.",967593600,,1169,4.4672897196261685
2136505,5,B0002WYTWG,"I just bought this DVD yesterday (the day it was released), and I have to say that this DVD has it all. There is so much stuff on it, it will take  you hours to see it all (6 hours of content is what the label says). It  also includes a 32-page booklet and the DVD was enclosed in a metal cover,  very cool.
Anyway, one thing I was happy to see is that both Dolby  Digital and DTS sound tracks are included. Actually Dolby Digital EX, and  DTS ES, which I think are advanced formats.  I think that most DTS DVDs  don't include all the extras for some reason, so I haven't bought any yet.  Most surround sound fans are aware of the battle between the two formats,  as to which one has the best sound. Now you can hear it for yourself if you  have both Dolby and DTS decoders. I do and I must say I was most impressed  with the DTS version. But to be fair, I haven't watched the Dolby version  yet (That will be tonight).  If you do watch both versions, review here  which one you think is better.
The special edition version has added  scenes, which adds to the movie. For example: You get to see the first  terminator learn to smile. One of the interesting added scenes was of sarah  almost destroying the first terminator out of fear, by crushing his cpu  brain while they where reprogramming him to learn. Her son stopped her  of-course.
Buy this DVD. It is well worth the money. Especially if you're  an Arnold fan.",967593600,,1418,4.220149253731344
2136506,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is one of the best looking and sounding examples of DVD technology yet.  Let me put it this way.  It's the best I've seen.  The DTS sound is  excellent and after some fine tuning via the provided THX monitor test  patterns the pictures is as good as it gets.  It's clear, sharp and free of  any compression artifacts.
There are two reasons to buy this DVD:  First,  it's a great movie.  Second, it's the perfect home theatre showcase/test  disc.  It also has a metal cover! Cool!  Buy it, buy it, buy it... PS:  Buy a bigger subwoofer too!

2136507,5,B0002WYTWG,"""T2"" is, in fact, one of the most well-written, poignant, and utterly human stories that has ever made it onto the screen.  James Cameron has always  been a master of telling beautifully human stories that he can dress up  with a lot of gunfire and explosions in order to create an all-around hit  between the people who ""get it"" and the people who don't.  I feel  that the greatest tragedy of ""T2"" is actually most of its  audience's inability to grasp the more meaningful human moments in the  film, particularly in the brilliant and shattering role reversal played out  between Sarah Connor and her worst nightmare, the Terminator, when she sets  out to alter the future at the expense of another human life and suddenly  realizes what she has become--while the Terminator is now the one  protecting human life!  This is phenomenal storytelling, and anyone who  thinks that there is ""very little"" to the film apart from the  groundbreaking special effects seriously needs to take another long, hard  look at the intricate plot and character arcs that James Cameron so  masterfully created and seamed together in this magnificent movie.  The  added 15 minutes for this Special Edition tremendously enrich the character  arcs, in fact, and I am so delighted that it has finally been made  available on DVD.  So pick it up, and make sure you pay enough attention to  appreciate it for the beautiful tale of humanity that it truly is!  :)",967507200,,1437,4.818930041152264
2136508,5,B0002WYTWG,"In the 90's, the only action movie apart from Die Hard was Terminator 2, required viewing for a generation of teens (Myself included). Now, almost a  decade later, the movie has finally been released on a format to do the  amazing effects justice. Many of these effects, such as the famous T-1000  truck scene are still unparallelled in modern movies. The DVD also adds in  a rather surprising commentary by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was much more  thoughtful and intelligent than you would believe. James Cameron also  appears to give thoughtful pearls of advice.  However, what really shocked  me was the quality of the sound. This will replace Saving Private Ryan as  THE film to show off your sound system with.  Finally, if you've never seen  the movie, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Unlike many action movies, this  one has a plot, with Linda Hamilton giving an amazing performance as Sarah  Conner, in a mental institution since the first movie.  Excellent Stuff.",967507200,,973,5.0
2136509,5,B0002WYTWG,"I'm irked. I bought the T2 Special Edition laserdisc box set (used, but I still paid $75 for it) and now they come out with this. I almost didn't buy it because I had the box set, but I'm damned sure glad I did. This is quite simply the best DVD package that I've seen yet. I knew it was going to be different when I had to remove the stainless steel slipcover. I wasn't disappointed.
The interface is top notch - very slick, but doesn't hum at you (like some DVDs do) while you're making a selection. Lots of cool sounds when you change levels, though, and very good CGI imagery. The movie side of the double-sided disc has both the original version and the special edition director's cut. Instead of a long solo commentary from one person, disc supervisor Van Ling narrates and intersperses audio clips from 25 other people who worked on the film from Cameron to Schwarzenegger and the other primary actors, effects people, etc.
The other side contains three documentaries; the first on the making of the original version; the second on the deleted scenes; and the third on the making of the Universal Studios T2:3D stunt show. (Spoiler warning: if you haven't been to see T2:3D, then I suggest that you wait to watch this one.)
The other stuff on this side is what you can get on the laserdisc box set; fifty chapters of step-by-step pages, interviews, and background video clips on what it took to make the film. Added is a chapter on the T2:3D show and an insight into the making of a DVD.
I guess I'll keep the T2 laserdisc box, because after seeing this, no one is going to want to buy it when they can get this. Extremely well done on the part of all involved.",967507200,,1668,4.4188311688311686
2136510,4,B0002WYTWG,"The previous release of T2 on DVD left a bland taste in my mouth.  No extras to speak of, no commentaries, no deleted scenes.
Not so with the  newest release of T2, appropriately named The Ultimate Edition.  This DVD  is the paramount of why DVDs are worth the switch from VHS.  Not only does  the sound and video look pristine (you can actually hear the leather of  Schwarzenegger's jacket creak when he gets off the bike at the beginning of  the movie), but the special edition really adds a lot of flavor to the  existing movie.
In the theatrical release, the T-800's sudden change from  a cold, unfeeling cyborg to a smiling, caring soul was a bit odd, but the  special edition a lot of questions are answered.  There is quite a bit more  character development, more of Sarah's insecurities, more of John's  leadership qualities, more of the T-1000's sadistic tendencies.
The only  reason I didn't give this DVD five out of five was because Artisan made me  spend another 30 bucks to get the great stuff that I should've gotten with  the first release of the movie.
If you've previously bought it, or  you've seen it and been waiting for the right time, or if you've never even  seen it before, I would highly suggest this movie.  It's a great addition  to any DVD collection.",967507200,,1280,4.575221238938053

Finally, two and two have been put together.

A mediocre story that we're  given only only to get the audience from one action scene to the next.  The  movie is entertaining on the basis that you've seen the far superior first  film.  The film does do what Cameron wanted it to, however.  That was to  build a new level of special effects in the early 90's.  On that level this  is a succesful film, but almost seems more like a sequel to The Abyss  rather than The Terminator.  Just as The Abyss brought cg up a notch, so  does this film.

  To those who  haven't,you better find time to see it. When you want non-stop action and  excitement you sit and watch this movie. This is one of your best  options,ain't no doubt. Myself,I've seen it maybe a dozen times,and still  I'm excited every time all the way.
  I rememeber the time the film was  released ,back in 1991. Seeing it on the wide screen was a major experience  for me,which I carried in my mind for quite a long time. I'd recommend this  DVD version to anybody who wishes to get the feeling of a cinema with a  film that was made, and best viewed on the wide screen.",966643200,,784,4.216216216216216

The acting is superb.  Although Arnold's portrayer  of the Terminator was right-on, Michael Biehn is even better. I can't take  my eyes off him.  His character is man from a horrific future who knowingly  sacrifices himself for Sara Conner.  Every movement of his eyes, every  facial expression, every word out of Michael Biehn's mouth is that of the  character.  When you watch the movie, you know you're watching Arnold  Schwarzenegger, but Michael Biehn WAS Kyle Reese.  It's too bad that Biehn  never received the recognition he deserved.
My favorite part is when  Kyle descibes a picture he had of Sara and then confesses his love for her.  He gets up from his chair and nervously starts packing away explosives  into a bag saying, ""I shouldn't have said that.""  Sara comes over  to him, takes his face in her hands and kisses him.  What I would give to  take her place!
I could go on and on forever about this, but I'll end  here by saying that both this and sequel are excellent, but this one is  better.  It has extreme replay value, which is why you buy several copies  :)

The  T-1000 played by Robert Patrick is an excellent role, as he looks freaky,  and is a great T-1000. Linda Hamilton plays Sara Connor, another great  performance by her. The sound on the dvd is almost flawless, due to the low  activity in the surrounds, it would get a perfect 5. But the video transfer  IS flawless, almost as good as Fight Club.

2136530,5,B0002WYTWG,"Upon the first release of the DVD, just having it is good enough for most people.  However, there is that tiny population, with me being one of them,  who have the luxury of owning a LaserDisc player.  People who do have the  money may have owned Terminator 2: Special Edition.  This edition is  definitely special.  Not only is this edition with the movie.  It is the  movie in its entirety.  It is the movie with various edited footage and  scenes that were not shown in the original movie release of T2.  I remember  watching this movie over at my uncle's house and seeing how it all fits so  nicely together.
The problem with the first release of the DVD is that I  was too spoiled.  Everyone who has seen the movie already knows what to  expect.  But for those like myself who has seen the added footage, it is  definitely not whole.
And now, August 29, 2000... the same date (month  and day wise) used in T2 that tells the tale of the destruction of humanity  and the war against the machine starting... we are now graced with the  ultimate form of T2, likewise the name of this release.  I fully recommend  this for any T2 fans.  I recommend this even to those who has not seen the  movie in its true entirety.  Not only will this release make much more  sense, it will bring some closure to the questions that often plague our  minds.
People who are seeing this movie for the first time, I cannot help  but recommend seeing the first and original Terminator.  I know the effects  and everything about it will look old and outdated to you who has seen  glimpse of this movie.  But it will make seeing T2 a lot more enjoyable  because you will have the background story to fill in.
And what is my  personal opinion about this?  Is it worth buying?  For 40 dollars retail,  that is a lot to ask for.  However, considering this to be the ultimate  edition, I say it's worth 40 dollars spent to receive a copy.  And if you  find any other places with a better price than the MSRP of 40, it is safe  to say that you got your money's worth.  Definitely both a collector's and  a viewer's item.",965433600,,2094,4.322077922077922

Since the track  was included in the previous disk, I kind of wonder why they didn't keep  it.

Anyone who hasen't had the cahnce to  check it out needs to go see what i'm talking about because it is  action-packed from beginning to end. Getting back to the movie I have to  say if u have a home system don't hesitate cranking up the volume and  watching this. It will make it like your seeing this for the first time if  you haven't seen it already. The plot, action, and ending was all on point  and it's nothing I can really say I didn't like. It really made you think  about the future and what would happen when it came out. Even wathcing it  now makes you wonder. Overall, the creators out-did themselves with this.

2136534,5,B0002WYTWG,"Terminator 2 is a more mainstream, thoughtful sequel to 1984's ""The Terminator."" Whereas Terminator 2, was a dark, horrific, brutal film, T2 is more about the theme of the future of humanity in a nuclear era.  Blessed with a huge budget and a superb script Cameron successfully turns  the tables on Arnie's character and Sarah Connor's developing relationship  with the Terminator. Also effective is John Connor's development into the  leader he becomes in the future during the film.
Previously only  available on special edition laserdisc, the DVD ultimate edition adds much  more background and detail to the story. As with Aliens, the 15 or so extra  minutes of footage add mainly depth to the characters, for example, the  Terminator learning to smile, Miles Dyson's family, and the T-1000 taking  pleasure in killing a dog. This is unlike ""The Abyss"" with the  half an hour which adds a whole new storyline at the end!
As with all  Cameron films the sound is amazing, really sharp, clear thumping sound  although the Brad Fiedel soundtrack is a bit wimpy in comparison to a James  Horner or Jerry Goldsmith score. It does work well - the dark synth score  fits with the metallic machinations. Expect the picture quality to be  amazing!
What would have made this release perfect is if was presented in  full screen as well as 16:9. As Cameron filmed it in Super 35 you miss some  of the film in widescreen and some of it in full screen (unlike pan and  scan). So, it looks like I'll still be using my full screen laserdisc for  sometime to come! All we need now is for them to go back to the original  Terminator film and remix the sound from Mono into Dolby 5.1!
Brilliant!  Buy it!",963532800,,1688,4.673469387755102
2136535,4,B0002WYTWG,"As sequels go, this is one of the best - along similar lines to the same director's 'Aliens', it's bigger, more expensive, and louder than the original. It isn't quite as good, but I'll get to that in a minute. 'T2' was released at the height of Arnold Schwarzenegger's majesty, and viewed  in almost every way it was a triumph, combining state-of-the-art  computer-generated effects, the biggest movie star in the western  hemisphere in the one role he was most suited for, and a director noted for  his command of technology, and a more family-friendly tone (to suit the  caring, sharing mood in the early 1990's). Even at the time, it didn't seem  perfect, though. After a promising start the film slows down disturbingly,  with two plots fighting each other to a standstill - Robert Patrick's  effectively stoic T1000 disappearing from the narrative for the middle  section of the film, to be replaced by a less-interesting, more pyrotechnic  subplot involving the destruction of Cyberdyne Systems, inc. Still, the  film is of such quality that this can be forgiven, as can the cliched  finale, set in what Roger Ebert would describe as an 'abandoned flame  factory'. A few years later there was a 'special edition', with a few  decent extras which clarified the story without slowing the film down, and  now there is a DVD. a glance at the contents reveals good stuff  (essentially: 'making of', lots commentaries that nobody will ever hear,  the special edition elements, trailers) and bad - six hours of footage on  one CD does not bode well for picture quality. It would have been nice if  the accompanying 'T2:3D' iMax presentation could somehow be included, but  you can't have everything.",963532800,,1699,4.936395759717315

This movie is directed by James Cameron and I think many would agree that Terminator 2 is one of his best films.  The acting is pretty good for an  action flick.  Robert Patrick does a convincing job as the cynical T-1000.  The rest is of the cast is ok.  Computer graphics excel in this movie.  I  still can't believe how they did this in 1991, and the graphics are still  comparable current films.  Action is great and there's a lot of it.  But  there is also a great story.

2136537,3,B0002WYTWG,"This film is so much worse than the first Terminator film it's incredible.  It is a very good action movie with good special effects, fun performances, and good violent sequences, but there are so many plotholes  it's hard to think about the movie itself.
The first big mistake was the  casting.  This film supposedly takes place 11 years after the first one,  giving John Connor the age of ten.  So what do they do but cast  fifteen-year old pubescent Edward Furlong as the kid.  I like Furlong as an  actor, but he sure wasn't very convincing as a ten-year old.  Also  established is that in this film Sarah Connor is twenty-nine, even though  Linda Hamilton, at the time, was nearing forty.  She didn't look that bad,  though, it's just that I don't see how we can be expected to believe she  was 18 in the first film.
And then there's the famous truck on the  bridge.  How did the truck build up that much speed going sideways on a  bridge?  How did it even turn around so that it was facing the side  wall?
And then there's the whole future.  Let's recap from the first  movie.  The machines have lost, so they build a time machine, and send a  terminator back through time.  It has to go naked, as dead stuff won't go  through, and its chassis is protected by its flesh.  The humans steal the  time machine, send though a soldier, and destroy the machine.
Now, the  machines don't have the time machine anymore to send back a second  terminator, and even so, if you think logically about time travel, how  would they know if the terminator had failed the first time.  As far as the  future is concerned, it just goes on.  But even if, somehow, they realized  their plot had gone awry, and managed to build a second time machine in the  face of defeat; how did the send back the liquid metal terminator -- he's  got no living components; he shouldn't be able to go through.  Or, if it's  a new model Time machine that allows metal, why didn't they send back  guns?
This movie, although the acting was pretty good, didn't have much  of the human element of the first movie, not for lack of trying, and too  many scenes seemed lifted straight out of the first movie, including  dialogue and the truck chase.
There's just too many contradictions,  plotholes, and oversights in this movie to make it great like the first one  was, it was merely an enjoyable action flick.",962496000,,2372,4.464788732394366

If you have not seen it this is a MUST-HAVE movie.  DVD makes it all the  more better with the original letter-box veiw.

Either way  it's a good story of human nature and the fear of machines too smart for  humans own good. The special effects were trailblazers for movies such as  the matrix and even jurrasic park.

2136541,5,B0002WYTWG,"This is the sequel to Terminator, James Cameron's first majr blockbster.  The basic story of T2 is two cyborgs(Arnold Schwartzenegger and Robert  Patrick) are sent back in time. One to kill the future leader of the human  resistance in the war with super intelligent machines(John Connor AKA  Edward Furlong), the other to protect him. Unlike the first Terminator,  Schwartzenegger plays the role of the hero and is more humane in his  actions. Like most of James Cameron's movies, special effects are  outstanding, as is the action. However, there has always been one thing  that has always bugged me about Cameron's movies. The theatrical releases  are often cut to shorten the experience and take away from the actual story  being presented. Examples of this are ""The Abyss"" and  ""Aliens"". There is more action, with a better symbolisation of  motherhood in Aliens with lost footage intact. In the Abyss, characters are  given more depth with the alien encounter becoming all the more profound in  the special edition. And just like those two movies, Terminator 2 is a far  more superior film when presented in it's complete form compared to its  theatrical doppleganger. Charcaters are given more life, especially Arnie  in his interactions with Furlong which go a long way to explaining Arnies  more cuddly side, as well Sarah Connor's(Linda Hamilton) concerns over the  machine which is watching over her son. Highlights of the new footage are  the scene where Furlong opens up Arnies's head to reprogramme him, and the  Sarah's dream where Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn, the hero from the first  movie) forewarns her about the impending danger that their son is about to  face. This is by far a superior edition. Forget the theatrical edition.  This is the way the movie should have been. (I've heard rumors that Titanic  is missing twenty minutes of footage. Could Cameron's record with special  editions continue? We'll have to wait and see. ^_^)",960249600,,1950,5.072555205047319

2136543,5,B0002WYTWG,"Most sequels are criticised because they are just inferior rehases of the original film. ""Terminator 2 - Judgement Day"" is that rare thing - a sequel that is as good, if not better, than the original. James Cameron  piles on the grit, black humor and superb action in what is a worthy sequel  to his 1984 horror fantasy classic ""The Terminator"". As well as a  great story, this film has eye-popping special effects (which set new  cinematic standards back in 1991 and still look incredible) and one of the  most invincible villans ever imagined.
Arnold Schwarzanegger makes a  re-appearence here as the Terminator, but this time he is the good guy. He  is sent back through time to protect a young boy called John Connor (Edward  Furlong) from the T-1000 Super Cyborg, (Robert Patrick), a more advanced  Terminator whose liquid metal shape changing abilities make him seemingly  unstoppable. John Connor will eventually grow up to become the future world  leader and save mankind, which is why the T-1000 wants to kill him.
This  film also benefits from great performances from its human stars. John  Connor (Furlong) and his mother Sarah Connor (making a reappearence here,  played by Linda Hamilton) make the characters seem very believable - so the  viewer feels sympathy towards them. Schwarzanegger also adds nice deadpan  humor - ""Were you gonna kill him?"" John Connor asks  Schwarzanegger of one victim. ""Of course I was"" snaps the big  man. ""I`m a Terminator"".

From the standpoint of depth psychology, science fiction can be thought of as an unconscious but meaningful imaginal extrapolation of where we'll end up if  we don't change our collective course right now.

On another  level, the film is a good story with lots of action and special effects;  Arnold is convincing as a human-shaped tank of a Terminator reprogrammed to  be dumb and helpful, and Linda Hamilton does well as the strong and cynical  Sarah Connor, mother and protector of the future.

2136548,5,B0002WYTWG,"Before The Matrix and Battlefield Earth there was The Terminator. For the 80's this was the pinnacle of sci-fi creation and with the tools available they did a marvelous job. A terminator, a heartless, mindless, beast of  apocolaptic creation, designed for one thing, to kill you [similar to the  IRS]. One of the truely great sci-fi movies.

2136549,5,B0002WYTWG,"It is now accepted that ""The Terminator"", the predecessor of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is a classic science fiction film. This was not immediately obvious to a lot of people who only gave T1 the nod after the  success of T2. I am happy to lavish praise on both movies.  Consider though  that T1 had a production budget of less than one fifth of T2 and you may  start to get a feel for what an outstanding job was done on it.

Terminator is the story of a young woman, (Sarah Connor), being  stalked. When you get down to it, that is the essence of the film and also  the source of the suspense and empathy we feel for that character. We can  all imagine what it would be like to have your life placed at risk at the  hands of a persistent murderer.

Where this film pushes the envelope  is that the stalker is a cyborg, (part mechanical, part organic), killing  machine, (Terminator), from the future. Everyone else has said it so I may  as well. Schwartzenegger was perfectly cast in the role of an emotionless  machine of destruction. It's mission to assassinate the mother of John  Connor, who was to later in time become the leader of an army that opposed  the terminator's creator, Skynet.  Said creator being a self aware computer  that had taken control of the world by using the automated nuclear defence  grid.

Sarah has an ally in the form of a soldier who volunteered to  travel from the future to protect the mother of his commander against the  Terminator. Played by Michael Biehn, Kyle Reese is determined to save the  woman that he loves. He managed to fall for Sarah before he had even met  her, through a faded Polaroid that John Connor gave him some years earlier.  In my opinion, it is Biehn that shines in this picture. Yes, the rest of  the actors were excellent but this was the first major film that Bein was  in and he was nothing short of brilliant. I think that a large part of the  horror we feel towards the terminator is a reflection of Reese's attitude  and reactions to it. If this obviously tough and battle scarred veteran is  brought nearly to the edge of hopelessness then you just know the bad guy  is a serious problem.

Terminator was a fast paced film with a  relentless series of suspenseful chases and terrifying action sequences.  I  could not at the time imagine a film that could be as gripping, that is  until I saw Judgment Day, otherwise known as T2. Same plot only with the  roles exchanged. This time the victim is John Connor a twelve year old boy,  the original terminator, still played by Schwartzenegger, is the protector,  (reprogrammed in the future). The bad guy is also a terminator, but this  time it is an advanced prototype, (T-1000). No longer a Cyborg but a living  metal organism that can flow into any shape it desires.

If I  thought the first terminator was relentless then the T-1000 is unstoppable.  Well, at least until he faced the newly buffed Sarah Conner in the dramatic  finale. The special effects in T2 were ground braking and the attention to  detail was flawless in every part of the movie. I have never met anyone who  didn't walk out of the cinema after T2 with a look of stunned awe on their  face.",958003200,,3182,4.480769230769231

2136557,5,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron once said to remake this movie would cost him around five times as much now, as it did when he originally produced it. Which begs the question - why would anyone want to remake the Terminator?
It's first and  foremost a gothic love story, with a remorseless amount of terror and  tragedy. Sarah Connor, a waitress living a happy but uneventful life, is  destined to have a son who will change the world, turning the tide in a  human war against a terrible race of machines. (Anyone spot where the  Matrix got its plot from?) But the machines have mastered time travel,  sending back a ferocious cybernetic life form, merciless and unstoppable -  the Terminator. However, the human rebels steal the technology and send  back a single soldier, Kyle Reese, to defend Sarah against the  Terminator.
The struggle to survive or kill is perfectly portrayed,  without being overly sentimental or do-goody. Sarah, played by Linda  Hamilton, is a powerful heroine on a par with Ellen Ripley, and just as  tough. Her counterpart, Reese, played by Michael Biehn, manages to be  intense, frightening and human all in one fell swoop.

The sequel to Cameron's cult  classic The Terminator (1986), the film picks up the story ten years after  the failed 1985 assaination of Sarah Connor. Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is now  locked away in a federal assylum, and John (Edward Furlong) is living with  a unloving foster family. As mentioned in the film's mythic introduction,  another terminator has been sent through this time to kill John as a boy.

The menace and  invinciabily of Robert Patrick's ominous T-1000 adds the hyperkinetic spark  that make this film so thrillingly fun. This innovation gives the film the  creative edge and orginality to equal the first Terminator in both  intensity and emotional impact. One of the most important ScFi films of the  1990's, Terminator 2: Judgement Day is an intellectually intensive action  epic with much more philosophical impact than your average popcorn movie.

2136583,5,B0002WYTWG,"When I saw the first ""Terminator,"" I was hooked. I thought that it was one of the most fantastic combinations of sci-fi, action and drama I had ever seen.  I was reluctant about the sequel at first; I'd already been  exposed to insipid sequels to many films that couldn't hold a candle to the  original.  But then, I saw it, and I have loved it ever since.  This sequel  to James Cameron's 1984 movie adds to the story without diluting or  drastically changing the storyline, which is a great thing. It picks up  where the last one left off, albeit 10 years later. Another Terminator is  sent back in time to destroy the hope for all mankind.  This time, instead  of Sarah Connor (whose son is the future salvation for mankind in a  post-apocolyptic universe) being the target, it is her son John (who is  still a child) who becomes the subject of termination.  Rather than have  Schwarzenegger play the dreaded evil Terminator of the first film, Cameron  instead has him play a Terminator who has been reprogrammed to protect  young John from the dreaded T-1000 (Robert Patrick), who is a Terminator  with very advanced characteristics.  Sarah Connor herself has been  separated from her son, declared legally insane, and spent the years since  her first Terminator experience building herself up physically and  emotionally, becoming very military-like, to prepare for what she knows  will come.  It is up to John and his Terminator protector to save both her  and try to change the course of history as it will come to be known. But  can they do it?  Can they really alter the past in order to preserve  humanity?  And will they be able to avoid the T-1000 long enough to do it?  I was on the edge of my seat while these questions were being answered.  This film is the perfect blend of special effects and storyline, a great  sci-fi/action film with a very human heart.  It is great, and I love to  watch it whenever I get a chance.",949881600,,1936,4.597058823529411
2136584,4,B0002WYTWG,The first Terminator is not as good as the epic sequel that was made some years later. The plot is simple and this is still a fan fave and a cult sci-fi film.,948931200,,158,3.8181818181818183
2136585,5,B0002WYTWG,"The first Terminator - sent through time to destroy Sarah Connor - has failed. But the nightmare future portrayed in T1 remains to haunt the present. 10 years after the events in T1 a cyborg built of a mimetic poly -  alloy (liquid metal) is sent back through time to destroy the child John  Connor.
A reprogrammed T-800 is also sent back, with a neat twist in  plot to spice things up. Some stunning action scenes mark the battles  between the two near - indestructible opponents, but this is not all there  is to the movie. Indeed Robert Patrick's T-1000 character drops out  completely for a third of the movie, a time in which the director draws the  attention of the audience to some of the larger issues through dreams and  revelations between the characters. The themes concerning fate, technology,  and what it is to be ""alive"" are certainly near as big as themes  can get.
The T-800, which to some viewers has apparently appeared  warm/fuzzy is in fact no such thing, and there are many scenes - many! -  where the sheer coldness of its nature and single minded pursuit of its  goal to protect its target are exposed for the simple programming that they  are. There is no ""love"" or dedication in the human sense,  although the cyborg learns new persepctives through its travels,  culminating in a surprisingly emotional scene at the close.
As often  mentioned, the snake-like, liquid metal adversary is a masterpiece both of  acting and special effects, and ushered in a new era in computer graphics.  Although not as dark as the predecessor, this film was certainly prettier,  and explored a wide range both of film styles and themes.

No  ""Making Of"" (which I have the VHS version of), No commentary  tracks (come on James Cameron! Get with it!

2136589,5,B0002WYTWG,"James Cameron's ""The Terminator"" is not only one of the best actionmovies ever made, it is also among the most influential sci-fi films of all time. Even films like last year's ""The Matrix"" were at  least inspired by the man vs.machine-story of ""The  Terminator"".
From the beginning to the end, this film is packed with  incredible action scenes. It is especially wonderful that the action is not  just there for its own sake. The fine screenplay motivates everything that  happens onscreen. The film never lets up for one moment. In this respect,  it is superior to its successor ""T2:Judgment Day"", which  sometimes pauses for the sake of unnecessary discussions about the  consequences of violence (Pointless in such an exhilerating spectacle). The  film made a major star of Schwarzenegger, because his role was ideal for a  man with limited acting ability. It also put director James Cameron on the  map. He went on to helm classics like ""Aliens"" and  ""Titanic"".

2136592,5,B0002WYTWG,"Another reviewer already mentioned the Immaculate Conception. This was what went through my mind too. When you think about this film there is a rather biblical theme to it. Whether it's intentional or not is another  question.
What I mean is, when John Connor is conceived, Sarah is being  impregnated by someone who hasn't been born yet. Technically, he doesn't  really exist. So in a way, Sarah is like the Virgin Mary. Is it a  coincidence that John Connor, the one who will save mankind, has the same  initials of a messiah people worship already?
Armageddon is, of course, a  biblical theme. After it comes, John Connor will lead his followers in a  battle against Skynet, which could really be interpreted as the Antichrist.  The devil inside us(mistrust of the other side) was responsible for this  defense computer being built, and unleashing the evil that followed.
You  may well laugh at my theory, I'm not a religious person. But if my theory  is right, then this is the best screen adaptation of the Book of Revelation  ever made!",945302400,,1042,4.792134831460674
2136593,4,B0002WYTWG,"There is action galore in this film. This sequel takes place ten years after the first. John Connor, the future saviour of the human race, lives with his foster parents, while his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is  imprisoned in a mental institution, where the doctors are convinced her  warnings about the future are the ravings of a lunatic.
Since the  machines in the future failed to kill the mother of John Connor, a new  liquid metal prototype (the T-1000), has been sent to kill John as a child.  The resistance fighters have sent back a reprogrammed T-800 (Arnie) to  protect John.
The action is almost non-stop but there are some flaws  that I noticed. When the T-800 is looking after John we see a bit of the  T-800's non-human, emotionless personality, the way he uses words like  ""negative"" and ""affirmative"". Since the original  purpose of the Terminators was to infiltrate the human resistance groups,  was Kyle Reese (John's father) right to say that they're ""very hard to  spot""? Arnie is well-built and muscular, but wouldn't most people born  after a nuclear war be skinny and under-nourished? Sorry if this sounds  like knit-picking, I just thought it was worth mentioning.
The reason I  think this film needs another sequel is because of the ending. Sarah, John  and the T-800 try to destroy Skynet, and thus prevent the war from ever  happening. It is obvious they didn't succeed. If they had the time machine  would never have been built, Kyle would never have been born, and John  Connor would never have been conceived. Plus all those extras would never  have met violent deaths at the hands of the first Terminator. In which  case, the future must be set!
I give this film four stars because of the  great action and special effects. The plot also includes the neat irony of  mankind's dependence on computers, the things that end up trying to destroy  us.",944956800,,1880,4.785046728971962

T2 is a terrific movie also but not as good as the original.  If you don't have 'The Terminator' in your video or DVD collection then  get it ASAP!

2136605,5,B0002WYTWG,"Is The Terminator the greatest story of modern sci-fi?  One sure is hard-pressed to dispute such a mark.  The excellence of the film really can't be quantified.
The Terminator is a cybernetic organism - a machine  fitted within a living body.  It was created by a race of machines bent on  the extermination of the remains of humanity in the Earth of a  post-apocalyptic future.  This Cylon-flavored empire has also discovered  the means of time travel, and a cyborg assassin - Arnold Schwarzenegger's  titular terminator - is sent back to 1984 Los Angeles.
But following him  is a human soldier, Kyle Reece (Michael Biehn).  The purpose of both Kyle  and the cyborg centurion is to find Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton).  The  Terminator's program is to kill Sarah, while Kyle's mission is to keep her  alive and explain why she is being stalked.  This involves several exciting  set-pieces, such as a shoot-out in a disco, several car chases, and a  massacre by The Terminator (after uttering the immortal ""I'll be  back"" tagline) at LAPD HQ.  Because he is a machine, The Terminator is  impervious to almost all of the weaponry available in this time  period.
Amid the chaos, Sarah, after initially resisting Kyle, grows  closer to him, and eventually both realize that his mission to protect her  involves far more than either of them could have ever anticipated.  The  story gives the term Immaculate Conception an ironic and tender new  meaning.
The film's budget did not allow the kind of ultra-elaborate SFX  of the 1991 sequel, but the effects work as it is does the job quite  nicely, notably in Kyle's flashback where he and a squad blow up a walker  machine and are then attacked by an aerial raider - shades of The Empire  Strikes Back and Battlestar Galactica nicely rolled in one.
There is  chilling humor as well, from The Terminator's accosting of a trio of  degenerates to the afforementioned ""I'll be back"" tagline to his  curt dismissal of a janitor at a low-rent hotel.  Director James Cameron  has Schwarzenegger speak in the monotone of a Cylon, albiet without the  synthesized harshness, and it pays off perfectly.
This film was the  breakthrough for Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and director Cameron, and  remains a breakthrough in sci-fi storytelling.",943920000,,2271,4.9388297872340425

As to  the film itself - while I like T2 I always finds the first film better.  There is a greater sense of danger in this film. The Terminator comes  across as a truly frightening and unstoppable killer (the T1000 in T2 just  seems like a nice effect) and there is a constant feeling of  relentlessness.
The two Terminator films at least represent intelligent  time travel films as opposed to the dire Back to the Future movies and  their ilk.

What they're forgetting though is the strong characters and story that James Cameron  wrote. This movie is as much about love as it is about action. Of course  all of Cameron's pictures have a love story running through them. Also,  some people may say that the special effects aren't as good as T2, which of  course they aren't. It has always been my opinion that sometimes the old  fashioned way of creating effects brings more to a movie than the overblown  computer generated ones. No matter how good computer effects get, many  times they still look fake which I think has something to do with the  texture and new shine cp effects seem to have.

They used an actual robot for the  movie, which was controlled by men, but could easily have a mind of it's  own. Anyways, this movie is one of the coolest movies that I have seen.
