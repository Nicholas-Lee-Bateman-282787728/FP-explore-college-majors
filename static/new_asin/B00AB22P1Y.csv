8549567,1,B00AB22P1Y,"A complete waste of acting talent due to the non-existant dialogue, an ever increasing pile of cliches, a plot fleshed out by abundant retro costume and scene dressing effects but little action or characterisation in depth. There were plenty of moments of just vacant expressions. This emptiness seemed to permeate all aspects of this series.

A calculated tilt at segmented television advertising aimed at a female audience in a ridiculously over extended mini-series.

As for the handling of a story spanning several time periods - have the writers of this screenplay ever read one of the time shifting novels of Graham Swift - Last Orders or Waterland? I gradually grew more ashamed that the art of screenwriting was being devalued and degraded by such a shallow obviously commercialistic poor production.

The fact it has garnered praise here speaks volumes of the extent television itself has dumbed down its own audience and degraded its creative impact.",1510185600,,960,5.180645161290323
8549568,4,B00AB22P1Y,"Not a US dvd.  Not something I would normally watch but I happen to follow a couple of the actors and thought I would give it a try.  I found it rather confusing at the beginning as there are 3 different groups/eras involved  Once I got used to the switching between groups I found it quite good.  In fact I watched the entire 5 shows in one setting.  I definitely wanted to finish it.  I would have liked a little more in the ending as to how everyone made out but you could write your own ending and still enjoy it.  Just remember, you need a multi region player to view this.",1477094400,,578,4.107142857142857
8549569,5,B00AB22P1Y,"I bought this movie because Dakota Blue Richards is in it and I loved her other movies (The Golden Compass, The Secret of Moonacre)
This movie was different but interesting and keeps you guessing who did the dirty deed!
I liked it a lot.",1373673600,3,237,4.409090909090909
