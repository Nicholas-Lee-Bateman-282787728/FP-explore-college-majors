8623038,1,B00GGZENME,"This is probably the worst DVD I have ever bought. It features only two VdGG clips (Theme One and A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers). The rest of it is a random collection of live presentations excerpts by bands associated to Prog (Caravan, Nektar, Asia, Strawbs, Uriah Heep etc.). The VdGG clips are good, but all the rest is pointless. I didn't spend 14,99 (+ shipping + taxes) on an amateur DVD (made by Amazon) to watch 20 minutes of the band that is on the cover and more than an hour of excerpts by other bands. If you are a Van der Graaf fan, I recommend you either The Live Broadcasts or Godbluff Live 1975. The first cointains everything in the second plus 2 early TV appearances (1970), but the video aspect ratio is different and the first doesn't feature the 5.1 mix the second does.",1409961600,,792,4.431506849315069
