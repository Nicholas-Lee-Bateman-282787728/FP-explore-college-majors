8372499,1,B002LB8TY0,"Not at all what I was hoping for.  All the synopsis' I'd read made this sound like it would be about the culture clash between the festival and the village.  The trailers I had seen showed scenes of farmers talking about farming, inter cut with concert goers enjoying the show, and then shots of farmers interacting with the concert goers.  It looked like it would be the heavy metal version of ""Taking Woodstock"".  In reality, it's an hour and 10 minutes of farmers talking about farming, followed by 5 minutes of farmers helping with show preparation, a song performed by Kreator, then farmers cleaning up the festival grounds.  If you want to know the difference between a cow and a calf (a cow is only a cow after they've birthed a calf), then this is your movie.  If you want to see a behind the scenes look at Wacken Open Air, you're not going to find it here.",1425945600,,866,4.449367088607595
8372500,4,B002LB8TY0,"Before the annual Wacken Open Air Festival began in 1990, I suppose hardly anybody had ever heard of the tiny village in extreme northern Germany called Wacken, where 40,000 metal heads from all of Europe and far beyond, now congregate each summer for one of Europe's most famous metal festivals.

Full Metal Village gives a good look at the people of the town where this happens. From the old farmer/steward at the festival who jokes with the filmmaker about how every man over 65 need a girlfriend or two, just to give his wife a break, to a co-founder of the festival who left early on for fear that the financial commitment required would cripple his young family and his regrets about that since, to two teenage girls trying to become models (I'm guessing they'll succeed), to another farmer educating the filmmaker on various kinds of cattle, to another teenage girl somewhat disillusioned by rural life longing for the freedom the festival brings, to old and deeply religious women who hate and fear the festival, and more, you get many views on what the impact of the festival is on Wacken. You even see them remove the town signs for fear of them being stolen and instead put out cheap plastic ones they know will be stolen.",1257292800,4,1233,4.682027649769585
