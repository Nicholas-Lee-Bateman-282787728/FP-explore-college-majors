4233564,5,B003ZEA9F4,"Instead of the Han monolith that China is perceived to be, Damon and colleagues bring out the complex medley of different ethnicities to the forefront. The monolithic perception of China is to some extent is correct because of impact of the Cultural Revolution, absorption of many communities into one emerging Han identity and continued state encouragement of Han to dominate lands that were ancestrally belonging to minorities. Nonetheless after some recent reforms, there seems to be a new lease of life to these forgotten people of what is now China. Resurgence of identity and pride in their culture is key to survival of some communities that are explored in this documentary. Overall it is a nice cursory look. A good first introduction for anyone who is not aware of the customs of these ethnicities.",1358294400,5,808,5.037313432835821
4233565,2,B003ZEA9F4,"My wife and I were very interested in knowing more about the places and culture, yet the one on Taiwan was dedicated almost exclusively to Buddhism. We learned very little about Taiwan but felt inundated about Buddhism.

IF the jacket on the DVD set advertised this differently that would be fine. Yet it says nothing about this sort of thing and leads one to believe they will learn about these areas ""Discovering the Earth's Most Awe-Inspiring Places"", not just one specific thing about the area. We didn't feel we learned much at all about ""Earth's Most Awe-Inspiring PLACES"".

The one on South Africa was quite similar though at least more about South Africa. All in all, the price was right yet the subtitle seems terribly misleading.",1310256000,6,739,4.857142857142857

8410190,3,B003ZEA9F4,"Not a bad travelogue of South China, but the syrupy narrative gets to be a bit much.",1477180800,,84,4.0
8410191,3,B003ZEA9F4,"Interesting. The local costumes were most impressive. I resented, however, the heavy-handed intrusiveness of the narrator, Damon Redern. His direct conversations with locals were not as informative as would have been an equal time spent showing the everyday lives of the inhabitants, with Redern's presence limited to a voice offering a summary of his impressions in talking with them. 3 stars",1476403200,,393,5.459016393442623
8410192,5,B003ZEA9F4,"Well-photographed, interesting dialogue that takes the viewer into less-seen areas of China and interactions with local people and indigenous tribes. Very interesting.",1441584000,,167,6.636363636363637
8410193,3,B003ZEA9F4,"It is a great presentation, the moderator spent too much time giving his own philosophy instead of just presenting the life of the Chinese.",1429747200,2,139,4.833333333333333
8410194,2,B003ZEA9F4,"This is a rather distracting photo shoot of the author himself, and not of the country and its people and activities.
Further distracting is the speed with which the composition goes from scene to scene. More reminiscent of an
""action movie"" than a travel documentary. Would probably not watch this author again.",1402704000,2,312,5.019230769230769
8410195,5,B003ZEA9F4,it is so wonderful to be able to see the countries and sit in my chair but more importantly for people to view the other countries like they really are.,1397520000,,152,4.1
8410196,5,B003ZEA9F4,"Long time student of Chinese culture, i enjoy this narrative. If you enjoy travel, learning about different cultures, especially Chinese you'll enjoy this video.",1395532800,,161,5.75
8410197,5,B003ZEA9F4,My arm chair travel was expanded watching this.  quite enjoyable and an explanation from a slightly different view point.  Quite educational.,1387152000,2,141,5.666666666666667
8410198,5,B003ZEA9F4,"I love China and have never actually been there, but enjoy studying all about it.  This travelogue was respectful, educational, and enjoyable.  I would love to watch more travelogues with the same host.",1370390400,2,202,5.090909090909091
