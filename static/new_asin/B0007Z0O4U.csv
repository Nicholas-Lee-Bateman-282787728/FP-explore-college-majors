8054473,3,B0007Z0O4U,"I recently purchased this DVD at Wal*Mart of all places. I saw the cover and read the back description of the movie and decided I must get this movie. There are two great performances in the movie. One by rapper Coolio, who plays his role well. The other great performance is by another rapper, Chino XL who is absolutely beautiful. I can't even mention what I was thinking every time he was onscreen. Chino played his role with sarcastic humor. Much of the acting, sad to say is wooden and quite lousy.",1167091200,,503,4.478260869565218
8054474,2,B0007Z0O4U,"A RUTHLESS GANGSTA WHO'S TAKEN OFF DEATH ROW AND RELEASED BACK INTO SOCIETY VOWS TO KILL THE PRIEST AND THE COP [CHINO XL] WHO'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING HIM LOCKED UP. SLOW MOVING, TO SAY THE LEAST. THE FEW ACTION SCENES THAT'RE IN THIS MOVIE ARE DECENT, BUT IT'S TOO FULL OF POINTLESS DIALOGUE AND THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT REALLY GOOD ACTORS. ANYWAY, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE CHINO XL AND/OR COOLIO. IT AIN'T WORTH THE MONEY JUST TO SEE THESE 2 RAPPERS IN THIS STANDARD COP MOVIE.",1120521600,2,498,4.483516483516484
