8213982,5,B000UNVT3O,"Was not sealed in plastic shrink wrap
Case was broken, held closed with tape,
Case only snapped closed on the bottom, top snap was broken
Spindle that holds the DVD secure in the case was broken,
This made the disc move freely during shipping thus causing a scratch on the disc
