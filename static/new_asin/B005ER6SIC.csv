8611028,5,B005ER6SIC,"I'm a fan of the no-wave New York film scene of the 80's (which is documented so well in the film Blank City), and so I was very happy that the no-wave film Window on Your Present finally got a release. This is a film that cinephiles and art house theatre lovers will be drawn to. The film relies on skill and technique rather than special effects and loud noises to keep the audience engaged. It's rare and quite refreshing to see this from a modern American film. The black and white photography is beautiful in an urban decay kind of way, and the visual style of the film is huge strong point of the film. Fans of La Jetee and Down by Law will love this film.

Actually on the cover it has a quote from the influential Cannes Award winning director of Down By Law Jim Jarmusch stating that it ""Should be Regarded as a True Underground Classic!"". That is the icing on the cake for a film that any film student, or a fan of film should watch. Highly Recommended!",1354147200,2,963,4.262295081967213
