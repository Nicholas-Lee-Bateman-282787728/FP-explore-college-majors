8362463,2,B001L4CYGC,"I have owned many dogs throughout my life but never a St. Bernard. I bought every book I could and they all stated that Saints are very different. I bought this DVD thinking that it would address specific issues with the Saint Beranard but it was a very general dog training video.
If you have never trained a dog before you might get some helpful info from it but I would recommend seeking advice elsewhere.
It does give a brief history of the Saint Bernard and some other tokens of information but you would be better off reading a book.",1272412800,,539,4.4
