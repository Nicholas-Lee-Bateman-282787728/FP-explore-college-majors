6492279,5,B00LMKKY94,"I love Benson, it was a very funny show.  Great cast & writers lots of one liners. Benson & Krauss' feud is comedy gold",1495756800,,119,3.9583333333333335
6492280,5,B00LMKKY94,"I had forgotten about this show until I came across it on Amazon almost by accident. I have had all of the ""SOAP"" series for many years but forgot about Benson. I looked for other seasons and only found this season 1 and 2 pack. I figured that must be all that was made. Anyhow, the discs arrived here and I'm having a ball watching it. I don't remember ever actually seeing the show here (In Australia) but I may have just missed it. I did know about it though... Benson is a great character and the rest of the cast work well together. If you were a fan of SOAP (I think one of the funniest USA sitcoms ever) you should have Benson if you don't have it. Absolutely recommended.

My HUGE GRIPE though is this: Where are the rest of the seasons. Why have they not been released? Who do I write to to beg. The end credits show Sony as the owner but I don't think that's quite true.

My other smaller gripe is who designed the packaging. The discs come stacked on top of each other on a single spindle in the case. Totally impractical. Soon moved them to another 4 disc case though. These are minor in light of the belly laughs you will have watching Benson.",1493856000,2,1156,4.202702702702703

6492285,5,B00LMKKY94,"I used to watch the reruns on cable when I was a kid and loved it. I hadn't seen it since then until my brother encouraged me to buy it since it gave us good memories. So I did and my God I'd forgotten how funny this show was! It's so off-the-wall! I'm really enjoying revisiting old friends such as Governor Gatling, a widower/father who may not be the brightest bulb in the patch but his heart is always in the right place and he is very loyal to his staff. There's Kraus, the cantankerous, bossy yet good-hearted German woman who is the head cook at the Governor's mansion-she's been there for more than three decades. Marcy, one of the governor's aides, is smart, beautiful, good yet a bit ditzy but when she's crossed she can insult with the best of them! Then there's the governor's young daughter, Katie. She's a smart, funny, feisty and sweet girl who is loved by (almost) everyone on the staff. I can't forget the main character after which the show is named after: Benson himself. Benson is the head of the staff at the mansion. Benson is the smartest of the lot and the one every body else depends on most. Intelligent, witty, sarcastic, with some of the best zingers in the show, when you win his loyalty, you never lose it. He simply loves young Katie and the feeling is mutual. But some of the funniest parts are his scenes with Kraus, the sharp-tonged woman constantly exchanging insults with her adversary/friend Benson.  A fantastic show and a great way to escape reality while wishing you were a part of their ""family."" A must-see!",1483142400,,1549,4.5321428571428575

6492289,4,B00LMKKY94,"I'm so glad to own this. I would have put loved it but there are a few problems I have. Packaging is very basic and the dvds are stacked on top of one another, meaning I have to shuffle through them to find the one I want which can be a little frustrating. Also there are no subtitles or closed captioning. That's probably my biggest concern with this.
The show itself? I have no complaints. The quality is good, laughs are genuine and I am desperate for more! I really hope we get the other seasons released and soon.",1477180800,,518,4.242424242424242

6492299,5,B00LMKKY94,This was a good comedy TV series with great cast and writing. It is good it is out on DVD and showing how the episodes have stood the test of time and still great enjoyment to watch.,1462579200,,182,3.945945945945946
6492300,4,B00LMKKY94,"I love this show. Robert Guillaume is fantastic, as usual, and brings a delightful sophistication to what could otherwise become an average production that is easily-forgotten. The rest of the cast takes the opportunity to learn from a master, and brings their best to the table as well.

I am sensitive to the racial, now racist overtones of this show, due to the time during which it was created and filmed. Guillaume saves it in that aspect, as he plays the smartest, most sophisticated, most reasonable character on the show, even though the first episode has the assistant telling him that the ""governor is only seeing two blacks today"", and he is later mistaken for the other one, Rev. Jesse Jackson. Lines like that make me cringe, but remind me of just how far society has come in advancing basic equality.

Beyond that, the show is hilarious. The opposite of The Nanny, in this case the assistant is the one who saves the day and proves himself the better man over and over again, while the boss is warm and kind but clueless. The German cook and daughter to the widowed Governor are excellent counterpoints for Benson's even keel, one overbearing and the other years beyond her chronoligical age but too young to know how to use those powers.

Even in the age of the internet, I find it helpful to have DVD's handy. Out here in the country, our internet and power aren't entirely reliable. I can charge the computer from the generator or a solar charger as necessary, and we can watch a few episodes as a family even when we can't stream our normal shows or favorite movies. I like having the older shows around, so we have something ""new"" to watch.

I am a product tester, but did not receive any discount on this purchase in exchange for my review. I just like the show :)",1462147200,6,1784,4.565625

6492305,5,B00LMKKY94,"EDIT: I have watched 3 of the 4 discs so far, and I find no problem with the quality. I do have a big screen tv. Sound is good. No close captions, no frills. Yes it is difficult to get the discs out, but I am going to use spare DVD containers to make it easier and protect them.
A treasure beyond measure. I have not laughed like that since,,,, well Benson. :)

Hi.  I have no idea what the video quality is like, it is not a problem.  Sound quality matters.  STAR RATING IS FOR THE LAUGHTER.
After ""The Governor"" passed on, I remembered this wonderful show. A lot of life has happened since Benson went off the air.  I read the comments about the packaging.  4 disc's on top of each other is not a big deal.  If some video transfers is less than perfect, not a big deal.
I watched Benson on You Tube, and laughed like I haven't laughed in years.  ""Clayton Go Home"". I need to laugh.  A good TV show, can be listened to and enjoyed, just like a radio show.  This is brilliant stuff!  I appreciate Benson (and other shows) on YouTube, even if the quality is not good.  I can listen.  As it is, I have ordered this Benson 1 & 2. My son says the stacking on one spindle is no problem, I can go buy ""jewel cases"" DVD containers at computer stores, to store the DVD's if I want to.  It's worth it.  I will watch Benson, or just listen to Benson, I will Laugh.",1459641600,,1354,4.056603773584905
6492306,5,B00LMKKY94,"2 season of Benson at a crazy low price is a no-brainer pick up.  Benson and Krauss really make the show, and any fan of Soap would definitely want this, although Benson is pulled back a bit.",1458950400,,191,4.162162162162162

6492312,5,B00LMKKY94,"Hard to know how to rate this, the discs and episodes themselves are great, sure wish the other seasons were available and no reason why they aren't, no place to find out even......but as with so many other things in life, this ""package"" is made cheaper to save the manufacturer some money, that is, all four DVDs are snapped in to just one spot, all on top of each other.",1456531200,,372,4.328571428571428

6492318,3,B00LMKKY94,"This is a review of the packaging and transfer quality.  I loved this show as a kid and it still holds up for me as an adult, so as for content -- it's great!  I take off two stars, however, for slapshod overall packaging.

The packaging itself is pretty poor.  You get one standard DVD keepcase that ordinarily would hold 1 disc that is instead jammed with 4 discs all piled on top of each other.  There are no protective dividers, not even paper sleeves for each disc.  All four discs are stacked on each other on a single spindle.  This is asking for the discs to become scratched or damaged.  This is my biggest annoyance.

There are no extras or any frills whatsoever.  The main DVD menu is clean and simple, but not more than a simple listing of episodes over a smiling Benson.  At least they didn't stuff the disc with previews and other nonsense.  A little more flair would have been nice though -- like playing the intro music over the menu.

The transfer is pretty good to mediocre.  I've got some minor overscan issue that may be my player.  Compression artifacts are occasionally seen.  Not bad, but could be better.

Overall, this comes off as a slapped-together release.  The awful packaging is the primary detractor.  I'm going to have to find alternate cases.  Maybe I would have been better off ordering Seasons 1 and 2 separately (albeit at more than twice the cost!).",1451606400,,1386,4.534412955465587

6492324,5,B00LMKKY94,"'Benson' was probably one of the first US sit-coms introduced to the UK back in the 80s when we finally got a 4th channel. Until then, we had 'Happy Days', 'Taxi' and 'Diff'rent Strokes'. As much as I enjoyed them, I preferred the lesser known comedies. I also wanted more variety. We discovered many gems. I became addicted to American comedies, especially from the creation of Susan Harris. 'Benson' had all the ingredients of a classic comedy. Unique and sharp. Top rate actors, chemistry, great writing, hilarious one liners, Robert Guillaume's drole delivery of lines, perfect comedy timing, character driven all through the seasons so we grew to know and love the excellent cast portrayals. I hadn't seen this series for years and years so was delighted to find it through Amazon.com, as it isn't available in the UK, like many other US comedies. I eagerly await Season 3. Please release it soon!",1445212800,3,902,4.901960784313726
6492325,5,B00LMKKY94,"This was , and is , a great series. No canned or forced laughter! Bob Guillaume, and the rest of the cast, all worked together like a fine Swiss watch! I watched the entire series in one day, and did it again a day later. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to just, ""shut the door"" and forget about everything that you see in the News Media on a daily basis, and just sit back and laugh.
