903894,4,6304674228,"John Travolta's performance in Urban Cowboy is truly amazing.  Being from Oklahoma, and in the music business, it is easy to see that this production was right on the mark.  I have known many Bud's and Sissy's and I am amazed at the realism of this movie.  I have played in many honky-tonk bands since the early 80's and this is one of the the most believable scenerios I have witnessed on screen.  I have seen it all; jealous husbands fistfighting with other men, wives dancing with other men to make thier husbands jealous, drunk ""cowboys"" riding the mechanical bulls, it is all here in this movie.  Urban Cowbow changed many things in the honky-tonks and most of it was for the best.  This movie shows a slice of true life that us Okies and Texans and other Southern peoples may choose to live if we want.  I've seen this movie many times and will see it many more.  Give me a twelve-pack and Urban Cowboy in the VCR and I feel like I'm right there at Gilley's with the rest of them.  My Stetson is off to John Travoltla and the rest of the cast on this one.",984268800,17,1061,4.291457286432161
903895,2,6304674228,"This has got to be one of the most overrated movies in history.  It's not that I don't like John Travolta either.  It's just that I don't buy him as  a country guy who goes to bars, line dances, and rides mechanical bulls.  Debra Winger is good and so is the supporting cast, but that's not enough  in my opinion.  There's the music to consider, too.  It's so polished and  movie-ish that it has no edge whatsoever.  It is the exact kind of country  music you would expect some Hollywood moron would think was good.  I highly  recommend you watch this movie before you think about buying it.  You might  save yourself some money.",967939200,2,629,4.4035087719298245
903896,4,6304674228,"Had not viewed this flick in 10 years.  In the last 2 months have seen it three times and enjoy it more with each viewing.  JT seems to encapsulate an era (ie Saturday Night Fever) this movie and CD will not let you down.  A must have for 70's survivors!

903897,5,6304674228,"I love this movie so much.  I think this is the world's most romantic movie.  It isn't romantic in the traditional sense like Ghost or anything like that. It is romantic in a realistic sort of way.  The characters are  real, they argue, are insecure, and jealous just like how we are in real  life.  In the end when Bud fights for his woman you know despite all his  faults he loves his wife more than most of us can ever hope to be loved.  That is romance!!!!",940723200,7,460,4.1477272727272725

904178,1,6304674228,"Thus is one of those films from when i was a kid that I just wanted in my movie library. I thought the digital version would be convenient as I have several in my Amazon account. However, this digital version has such horrible sound quality that I cannot hear any scene with only talking even when i move the volume up to 100! The scenes with talking and music are fine and any scenes with just music are extremely loud.

I need to constantly adjust the volume on my speakers throughout the entire film.

As a reference to my electronic experience I want to note that I am a film editor and work in the film industry so I do have nice playback equipment and I also know how to use it.

I recommend buying the DVD version or Blu-ray if it's available but not this Amazon digital version.",1515974400,,786,4.261744966442953

904262,4,6304674228,"RELEASED IN 1980 and directed by James Bridges, Urban Cowboy is a drama starring John Travolta as mid-Texas young man who moves to Houston to work at the oil refineries. In his spare time he goes to the local Country bar where he meets babes (Debra Winger & Madolyn Smith) and rides the mechanical bull. Scott Glenn plays his rival while Barry Corbin & Brooke Alderson appear as his amiable uncle and aunt.

Its overlong by at least 20 minutes and the alcohol-obsession & bed-hopping shenanigans get tedious, but I like the docudrama style. The film takes its time and successfully puts you in the C&W subculture. The plot's predictable, showing the best & worst in human behavior, yet leaves you with a good feeling. Theres a likable simplicity and honesty to the people, despite their less savory sides (i.e. the alcohol/cigs & bed-hopping). The movie scores well on the female front, mostly of the tight jeans & t-shirt variety (naturally), fronted by Winger with her girl-next-door cuteness and followed by Smith with her drop-dead-gorgeous ambiance. Connie Hanson appears as the striking redhead. The final act features the Charlie Daniels Band and you can't go wrong with them.

THE MOVIE RUNS 132 minutes and was shot in the Houston area of Texas (Dear Park, Pasadena & Huntsville) and Pico Rivera, California (Mobile home park). WRITERS: Bridges & Aaron Latham wrote the script based on Aaron Lathams story.

One of those Great Block Buster Hollywood films of the past that shouldn't be missed..along w/""Top Gun"".  Current ones...I can do very nicely w/out.  Loved the music & went to a pre-opening ""sneak-peak"" at a Century 25 theater in San Jose CA w/Robert Evens actually in attendance.  Looked disheveled & like he'd been up way too many hours.  Travolta never looked better & Debra held her own quite well.  A story of 2 immature kids married too soon making a lot of mistakes & who still managed to pull it together.  Gotta give 'em that...some of our youthful marriages didn't survive.",1497225600,,660,4.6869565217391305

905800,5,6304674228,"I give it 5 stars!! This is one of my very favorite movies. Maybe I am partial to it because I am from Houston and worked in Pasadena down from where Gilley's was, but you won't find a better soundtrack from a movie than this one. I have owned many CDs of the soundtrack and have worn them all out. This movie depicts the days of good times, good beer and a whole lot of dancing to the best music ever. You don't have to be from Texas to enjoy this movie and it is a must see for people of all ages. Finally, a movie came out where people dressed like I had my whole life. I remember people calling me ""COW PATTY"", and making fun of my cowboy/cowgirl attire but when this movie hit the big screen, I became one of the most popular kids in school. I was no longer ""Cow Patty"" but instead, a girl that the boys wanted to date. There were a few others in my school that were country like myself, and soon we were the cool chicks, ""KICKERS"", as we were called. When the song "" I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool"" came out, we sang that song with a new found pride. At the time, I attended McCullough High School in The Woodlands, Texas and it was a very rich school, with rich kids driving Mercedes Benz and BMW's. Suddenly, everyone wanted pick up trucks, with oversized mud tires on the back, and personalized name plates in the back windshield. On our rear bumpers, one side was a Gilley's sticker, and the other side, a Kicker sticker. Though the fad passed and the faddish people went back to their old ways, I still today, wear my boots, hat and jam to the soundtrack of this awesome movie. Good music never dies or even gets old. Go and purchase a great piece of history, sit back and enjoy the way things were.",1476144000,3,1718,4.193353474320242

906199,4,6304674228,"I happened to see in quick succession ""Urban Cowboy"" and ""Diner"" -- two movies that might be said to be about immaturity, especially male immaturity, and both of which have attractive musical scores, though music is more to the fore in ""Urban Cowboy,"" which really has an outstanding C&W-flavored soundtrack.  The story itself is a bit like a country song -- two young people fall in love and marry too quickly, before they have discovered what kinds of compromises will be necessary.  They separate, briefly take up with other partners, only to discover that they really love only one another.  Bud Davis (John Travolta) has come into town (Houston) from the farm to work in an oil refinery with his uncle and to have fun in Gilly's a popular nightclub and musical haven, where he meets Sissy (Debra Winger) and in short order marries her.  When Gilly's installs a mechanical bull, on which Bud fancies himself, and when he forbids Sissy to ride it, the trouble starts, and this gives the paroled ex-con rodeo rider Wes Hightower (Scott Glenn) a chance to make an impression on a rebounding Sissy.  Bud, for his part, takes up with a smooth socialite, Pam (Madolyn Smith), and both he and Sissy spend a good deal of time trying to show that they're happier in their new arrangements.  Wes, however, proves abusive, and he's planning a robbery, and the question then becomes whether Sissy and Bud can swallow their pride and re-establish their marriage.  It takes injury and a death to wake Bud up, and Sissy likewise has to suffer.  But she does learn to ride the bull (very well) and Bud learns to accept that -- she's a strong woman and deserves respect.  The big climax -- accompanied by some very lively music -- is the bull-riding competition where Bud goes head to head with Wes . . .

It's all great fun, and the generic and predictable elements of the plot are easily overlooked in light of the energy of the music and the unaffected directness of the acting.  Travolta and Winner have roles here that are well within their capabilities, and Scott Glenn can be effectively frightening as the violent and unprincipled Wes.  Musical highlight?  I'll opt for ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia,"" with a young-ish Charlie Daniels in fine form.  Travolta, fresh from ""Saturday Night Fever,"" even does a little two-steppin'.  And, if the special features are to be believed, he and Winner did their own bull-riding, and quite impressively too.  It's all very enjoyable, even if its take on immaturity is fairly predictable.",1465084800,,2523,4.778801843317972

907256,5,6304674228,"I turned 16 in 1980 when this movie came out. A couple of years before that, Saturday Night Fever came out and really made John Travolta a mega star. As a teenager, I wasn't as impressed with Urban Cowboy as I had been with Saturday Night Fever but I liked some of the music (The Devil Went Down to Georgia, specifically) and I was very aware of all the young men wearing cowboy shirts and cowboy boots (I may have also had a pair of cowboy boots myself back then). Fast forward to modern times and I'm now (gasp) ""middle-aged."" A few weeks back, CMT (Country Music Television) presented the documentary Urban Cowboy: The Rise and Fall of Gilley's as well as the film and I got to look at it with news eyes and lots of interesting background bits.

As I look at it as an adult now, I see it in a whole new way. Yes there are some similarities to Saturday Night Fever that I guess the producers were piggybacking off of - the Night Club everyone went to all the time, the music, the love triangle, someone close to the main character dying, mechanical bull riding in place of the dancing aspect, a big contest at the end of the film - you see where I'm going with this. In any case, this was a lot deeper than I had remembered it the first time around (as is Saturday Night Fever, I should add).

I was reading the review by Connie (Hanson) Taylor who played the role of Marshalline, when I was purchasing this disc (which, by the way, is a steal at $5) and she mentioned that there were two versions of the film - the theatrical release and the TV version. She mentioned that the TV version showed Bud and Sissy going through the process of dating before they got married but in the theatrical release, they basically meet and then the next scene is them getting married. The version that CMT presented with the dating scenes is pretty much the same version as what is being sold here on Amazon so I wasn't able to decipher any major differences other than some graphic bits being edited for TV.

I think the documentary on Gilley's really needs to be viewed if you love Urban Cowboy because it brings another dimension to the viewing experience that made the film so much richer to me at this point in my life. The documentary is fascinating but I don't know if it's available on DVD right now as CMT may still be running it.

After seeing the documentary and buying the DVD, I purchased the entire album, too, on iTunes. I have a new appreciation for all of it.

P.S. Debra Winger, where are you now?",1436745600,,2502,4.326226012793177

907867,5,6304674228,"I will always love this movie! It is one of my favorites to come out of the 1980s. With the success of hits like ""Carrie"", ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease"" to his name, John Travolta yet notches another hit to his resume'. Add Debra Winger, Scott Glenn and a Country and Western theme  and you have a potential box office hit. It turned out to be one of the best of the year and from that decade. It has a following because so many love this movie for not only the actors/actresses in it, but the soundtrack as well. It has a good theme going for it and lovable characters with a good solid storyline. I am proud to have this on DVD (the 2002 edition) with some added features. Whoever designed the menu, did a fantastic job! I love it and it goes so well with this movie. I was 13 when I first saw this movie and I watch it at least once a year. I sometimes get in a mood to watch John's early movies and have a ""marathon"" of his big 3 dance hits. I have watched this one and then put on ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" after that. Debra Winger gives a ""revealing"" performance in that one! A great actress in her own right.

You can't beat some old John Travolta, dancing, and all the outlandish characters that come with this movie.  I'm not sure this movie is for everyone but if you like a bit of old movie/cult classic in a bad way then this is for you.  It's quite entertaining.",1395964800,,395,4.213333333333333

He takes a job at the refinery where his uncle works. He also meets Sissy(Debra Winger), a cowgirl, and they fall in love and suddenly get married.

When a bull-riding contest is announced, Bud decides to sign up. Can he win the contest and save his marriage to Sissy?

The characterisations were realistically portrayed by the actors. The character flaws of each and the blending of the story with the music was well done. You don't have to be a fan of the movie to see people you might know in this picture. The dialogue on the other hand  was less than stellar, but it's the story and the characters that make this motion picture work. The music is fun and adds to the enjoyment. Whether or not  you like it or hate it, the characters shine and the music is great fun. If you haven't seen it, try it out and come to your own conclusion. It's a visual glimpse into the cowboy bar era that is hard to forget, if you're a fan of that time. My sister and i have made a joke of it for years and we're both fans of it.

909357,3,6304674228,"I'm wondering if this movie, deemed a classic by many, was dubbed as such during the ""Travolta's THE hottest"" era.  Definitely a cute story, but it was a little dated.

909358,4,6304674228,"It may lack the gritty drama and disco flair of Saturday Night Fever, but Urban Cowboy is a pretty good showcase for the young John Travolta's dancing talents as well. The movie depicts the relationship between young Bud, (JT, whose Texas drawl carries a Brooklyn feel) a somewhat immature good ol' boy and Sissy, a smokin' Debra Winger who almost walks off with the movie.

Bud has clearly landed himself one tough cookie in Sissy, and the two are clearly just right for each other but as a couple they have to go through some rough patches  (he with a highly-moneyed heiress who enjoys slumming and she with an ex-con who feeds her desire for life on the wild side) before they can re-discover each other and come back together.

I re-watched Urban Cowboy with my sons a few nights back. OK, some parts of it didn't age well, such as the bull riding scenario as the great equalizer between men and women, but it was an enjoyable film for a family night. My husband and I had seen the movie when it first came out. Even though we're not exactly CW buffs, I really liked the soundtrack, which was kind of CW-lite. And Travolta had the right stuff back in his day.",1376697600,,1163,4.450704225352113

909514,4,6304674228,"When this movie came out in early 80s, Houston was going through major demographic changes. These changes particularly impacted the city of Pasadena and its white blue collar refinery workers. They gradually left Pasadena and other neighborhoods in Houston and found places to live elsewhere. Mickey Gilly's club, the largest bar in the world, some claimed, eventually had to shut its doors. What the movie did for a few months was to put millions of dollars in the pocket of western hats and boot makers all across America. In places least expected, people began to wear western clothes, yours truly included.

I always tell my daughter  ""See what happens when your pride gets in the way and you play games with someones heart"".  Some people aren't so lucky to get back together and end up losing  thier one true love...And never really feel quite complete, even after they remarry to someone else. And unfortunetly even you want to get back together you've already involved someone else and it would never be the same, Especially if other children are involved.

910152,4,6304674228,"""Urban Cowboy"" is one of those cultural icons, a classic, now part of the popular culture. The title touches upon a sense of displacement & desire to belong to a culture that represents a great deal of idealized qualities in American life. The title juxtaposes the words ""urban"" & ""cowboy"" in a way that describes a culture clash. Urbanites have to live together & get along to a certain extent, yet cowboys are loners. Ambitious, displaced rural youth find themselves attempting to reclaim a culture that may not have been accessible to them back home but which seems more familiar & authentic to them than what they encounter in a homogenized suburban setting or big city. Really, this is a story of the suburbs but ""suburban cowboy"" doesn't have the same ring to it.

The characters are mostly kind people, not intellectuals, who don't think things through very well as youngsters but learn from their mistakes & try to help others. New to town, Bud nearly instantly hooks up with Sissy & marries. There's not a lot of complexity to their relationship. They don't think through how they are compatible, their expectations around housekeeping & interpersonal behavior (jealousy, etc).

The basic human foibles - Bud's insecurity & controlling demands, Pam's sneakiness, or Sissy's knee-jerk reactions - are all basic human behaviors that we have all witnessed & observed. The only exception of ""real people"" is the character of Wes. He represents the strongest archetype in the film of evil/avarice and the least ""real"" person but a necessary foil to move the plot.

This movie shows solid character development & a progression in the two main protagonists. They do learn, move on, grow up and life goes on. This movie is lacks interest for a lot of people because of this - it's not ""exciting"" enough. It shows fairly normal average people, situations & behaviors. Just normal people trying to surpass their own shortcomings to establish genuine connections with each other.",1316563200,,1977,4.984848484848484

At the time of the movie, it was the largest honky tonk in the world. It involves romance,jealousy, conflict, & mechanical bull riding competition. It involves an ex-convict who steals Bud's wife, Sissy. Bud is protrayed by John Travolta, and Sissy is protrayed by Debra Winger. The ex-con physcially abuses Sissy. Also, the ex-con robs the office at Gilley's. After Bud finds out about the abuse the ex-convict has given Sissy, he attacks the ex-con, and the money he had just stolen from Gilley's office, falls out of his shirt. The ex-con is then apprehended. The movie includes performances by Mickey Gilley & his Urban Cowboy Band, the Charlie Daniels Band, Johnny Lee, & Bonnie Raitt. It ends with a happy ending.

John Travolta - young, handsome, talented and from an Italian-Irish Catholic family in New Jersey - was BORN to play Tony Manero in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Fever/dp/B00003CXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Fever</a>, and was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination at age 24.

He was not as obvious a choice to play a good ol' boy on the outskirts of Houston named Bud.  But by golly, he does it.  His inflection and phrasing would work in any honky-tonk from El Paso to Chesapeake.  His body language is just right, from the way he carries a long-neck beer to the way he hooks his thumb inside his belt. He even wears his cowboy hat correctly - pulled down to his eyebrows rather than exposing his forehead.

The story is no great shakes - basically a cowboy remake of ""Fever"", with a mechanical bull-riding contest substituting for the dancing.  Debra Winger is great as Sissy, Bud's love interest - feisty and sexy.  Supporting roles are performed with gusto by Barry Corbin as Bud's Uncle Bob and Scott Glenn as a mechanical bull-riding rival and former convict.

There have been other ""Yankees"" who have brought a Southern character vividly to life (Olympia Dukakis comes to mind...) but any time I see someone try - but fail - to play a southerner, I always think of Travolta in this movie, and think that it couldn't have been easy.

910329,2,6304674228,"It may possibly be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, but I cannot help but praise it for one very notable fact; Debra Winger is a goddess.  Yes, `Urban Cowboy' is silly, predictable and unnecessary, but Winger is so good she should have won an Oscar; seriously.

Take her out of the equation and there is no use for this ridiculous mess of a film whatsoever.

The film tells the story of Bud, a cowboy who travels to the city to start over.  He leaves his family behind (immediate that is) to move in with his Aunt and Uncle.  He works in construction by day and immerses himself in the Honky-Tonk culture at a local bar by night.  That is where he meets and falls in love with Sissy, a sexy young girl who could tame any mans heart.  The only problem is that Bud is an unlikable controlling jerk and Sissy is headstrong and independent.  So, like, they get married, fight and then split up; all because Sissy wants to ride a mechanical bull that Bud says is too dangerous for a woman.  Their marriage ends bitterly; Bud shacks up with a pretty city girl and Sissy lets a local ex-con seduce her.  The film boils down to a faux rodeo challenge where the men ride the mechanical bull for money.

Really, a movie about an obsession with a mechanical bull?

I am not a Travolta fan, but I have been known to enjoy him (especially when he works with Tarantino), but this performance was a mess.  He tries way to hard to be a cowboy that he comes off comical.  That and the character is just very off putting.  He has no redeemable qualities, in fact he's so rigid and unlikable that when he and Sissy split up we are not upset nor do we want them to get back together.  Sure, we like Sissy and we don't want to see her with that creep of a man she ran to, but we don't want to see her back with her creep of a husband either.

Like I said; Winger is the only reason this movie is remotely watchable.  She nails her portrayal of a small town girl who just wants to be loved and appreciated.  Her love for Bud, no matter how ridiculous, is believable; and her interest in winning him back on her own terms is reaching.

That, and she makes that bull look GOOD!

So, I can't recommend this, although I wish I could since Winger's performance deserves a better movie.  Anyways, this is stupid, truly, and I should give it an F, but Winger's performance is such a triumph for this film (really, superb characterization here) that I'm forced to give it a D.  Still, I'd stay away unless you are a die-hard Winger fan.  She has given superb performances in better films.",1236038400,4,2569,4.282157676348548
910330,2,6304674228,"I realize that Travolta was at the height of his stardom and Winger was an up-and-coming and talented actress.  I also realize that the honky-tonk mechanical bull-riding mentality had its season of popularity.

Even so, it is horrifying to me that a popular cable station describes Bud as a ""good old boy"" when he hit Sissy twice.  One abusive incident would have been enough to cost this character the ""good"" label.

In short, Sissy goes from the abusive Bud to the abusive ""real cowboy"", then back to the abusive Bud.  It is rather bizarre that Bud gets angry and outraged over somebody ELSE hitting Sissy, although he does not seem to have a problem doing it himself!  What an awful example to put out there for young girls to see.

Despite the star power and the short-lived mechanical bull craze, this is a movie about unprincipled men and a girl with too little self-esteem to seek relationships elsewhere.  Young and impressionable girls: beware.",1224720000,8,953,4.803680981595092
910331,5,6304674228,This was supposed to be the country version of Saturday Night Fever and was quite popular.  It actually is an even better movie.  The story was again taken from a magazine article on the popularity of a Texas bar named Gilley' where a new feature was the mechanical bull.  The writers developed a fictional love story to tell the story of the bull along with featuring Mr. Travolta and country music.  The movie was a great showcase for John Travolta's acting talents and featured two even more talented actors - Debra Winger and Scott Glenn.  They blew me away then and had pretty good careers.  Debra Winger left the profession for the most part but how can we forget her?  Scott Glenn is still seen occasionally.

being able to relate to this movie I would not know. Why?
Everybody in the movie are ignorant @ssholes just like
alot of the rednecks I've met in my life. No doubt the
characters play the roles to a T.... However, it's lame
and it started off a lame decade.

First of all, a real cowboy would actually be riding real
horses and such and not machines. This started the fantasy
land plastic cowboy that still plagues alot of the so
called cowboys nowdays. Just look at ""country music"" for
example and you should see what I mean.

The movie stars John Travolta as ""Bud Davis"" that is really
ignorant and and likes to hit woman and has a big fear of
a woman doing anything better than him. It also stars Debra
Winger as ""Sissy"" who seems to like to flirt and act like
she is innocent. The rest of the cast is pretty much no
namers with the exception of Scott Glenn, who is actually
a respectable actor in alot of his other films.

Why does this movie suck so bad?

1. It has Mickey Gilkey turning B.B Kings ""Stand By Me""
into a pathetic pop country sound without any soul.

2. It's laughable everytime they try pass a mechanical
bull rider off as a real cowboy. Sorry! Real cowboys
ride the REAL animals.

3. It's just cheesy. The characters are cheeseballs.

4. Bud just goes out and cheats on her and she accepts
him back after he confesses to her that he still loves
her. RIIIGGGGHHHTT! It's real believeable!

5. Scott Glenn is just stale. How any woman would even
consider getting with a character like him is just
doesn't make alot of sense. He is a personalityless
bore of a man that has crook written all over him.

Simply put, this movie killed cowboys as far as main
stream goes. It created too many wannabes and posers
and it's still this way even now. The mainstream cow
boy has been dead since this movie came out.

In the 70's you could see Waylon Jennings as a cowboy,
but who is the cowboy now? Tim McGraw? Kenny Chesney?
Please!

The thing is that I'm not a fan of 99.9999% of country,
but I know fakes when I see them... That's what most
of the ""modern"" cowboys are, and that is what this movie
really is aswell... A fake poser with decent acting.",1121990400,5,2218,4.333333333333333
910512,4,6304674228,"Although many folks laught this flick off, I have to admit that I am extremely fond of ""Urban Cowboy.""  My wife and I watch it just about every time it comes on television.  Granted, Bud slaps around Sissy and that may turn off some folks, but deep inside, there is more love between those characters than most of the couples in film and television these days.

With a giant honky-tonk as the primary setting, you get the expected rowdy crowds and rambunctious country music needed to set the stage.  The entire story revolves around the trials and tribulations of a young couple brought together by the bull...mechanical bull that is, and how they're almost torn apart by it.  They get ""Bud"" and ""Sissy"" license plates for Bud's truck.  They are ecstatic over a new trailer house.  They are pure white trash, and I love'em for it.  Colorful characters such as Bud's aunt and uncle, Gator, the ex-con Wes, Jessie, Mickey Gilley and even the Charlie Daniel's Band make for a great movie.  You couldn't make a film about a honky-tonk these days with characters like that.  First of all, you'd anger someone for making the working man look like an idiot.  Secondly, people will scream about spousal abuse.  Lastly, there aren't many real country stars like they had back in those days.  Can you imagine Tim McGraw onstage with back hair coming out of his vest instead of the incomparable Johnny Lee?  I think not.

Others say the acting is bad, that may be, but it is so bad that it is wonderful to see on screen.  Travolta's bathtub scene where he fusses at Sissy(Debra Winger) for not being home when he needs her is just hilarious.  Winger is at her sexiest as the somewhat tomboyish Sissy.  She's probably the main reason I watch this movie over and over.  When  Bud's aunt enters the Dolly Parton lookalike contest, her entire character becomes the focus of the film for a few brief, funny moments.  Barry Corbin was perfectly cast as Bud's well-meaning uncle.  You couldn't have picked a better cast.

Also, the characters are real.  Admit it, you've seen a drunk guy at the local bar fall off of his barstool.  In this movie, Gator just happens to fall off of a mechanical bull.  There are always one or two fights at the bar.  Also, I've seen plenty of angry drunks at the local Pitt Grill(an after-honky-tonk hangout with a great breakfast buffett at 3AM) throw fits like Bud did when Sissy gets a hat tipped to her by Wes.

910513,5,6304674228,"I played the role of Marshallene in ""Urban Cowboy"" and so to answer one of your reviewers, what was Sissy's last name? well here is the way it was. We didn't have last names; at least not assigned to us when we got our scripts. I actually made mine up when I needed one quickly in the Dolly Parton Look-a-like contest. You might recall that Marshallene was caught in the trailer with Wes, the convict. This film is such a ""cult favorite"" that it plays every day somewhere;my residuals attest to the fact that this film is loved by many. It made a fashion statement, (people went out and bought jeans and hats and boot and belts) it gave a boost to the Club business - where more and more C/W clubs sprang up all over the country and Canada. I had a motor coach bus and opened shows for Mickey Gilley and Johnny Lee and others for about 8 years - well into the late 80's. It was a magical time for all of us! It was a fun time for me and for fans. This movie is legendary and will last well beyond. Hope you enjoy viewing it as much as I enjoyed playing in it. By the way, there are a lot of versions of it. The edited for TV version actually is so different - (I have several more scenes in it) - and it shows Sissy and Bud actually""dating""  before they got married. The scenes were shot on location on the grass of Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas. I actually like that version because the original had them meeting one night at Gilley's and getting married the next afternoon!!!Connie Hanson",1106265600,195,1492,4.235087719298246
910514,4,6304674228,"Folks, you can almost smell the trailer park as you watch this movie!

For some reason, I am drawn to this film--and I have no idea why.  A post-Saturday Night Fever John Travolta plays Bud Davis, a self-proclaimed cowboy who temporarily relocates to the Houston suburbs to get a job and earn enough enough money to ""...buy myself a piece of land.""  His uncle, played by the wonderful character actor, Barry Corbin, introduces Bud to the redneck version of nightlife--as epitomized by the huge C&W nightclub called Gilley's (3 1/2 acres in size!).  While there, he meets the cute Sissy, played by Debra Winger, to whom he proposes on their first ""date.""  Her ecstatic reaction to their new home (a trailer) is absolutely hilarious.  You'd think they'd just bought a condo in Manhattan.

Things don't go well in the marriage and they quickly separate--with the gorgeous Madolyn Smith-Osborne taking a shine to the unsophisticated cowboy and Scott Glenn, as a bull-riding ex-convict, shacking up with Winger.  Throw in a mechanical bull-riding contest with a grand prize of (gasp!) $5,000 and you pretty much have the whole story.

In the end, love triumphs to send Travolta and Winger galloping off into the sunset together.

Oh, as an aside, I would mention that Gilley's, a real-life nightlife cowboy hot spot, burned to the ground under mysterious circumstances a few years after it was featured in the movie.  Insurance fraud by arson was suspected, but I don't know if Mickey Gilley ever wound up behind bars as a result.",1094428800,3,1525,4.91796875
910515,5,6304674228,"John Travolta,who became famous for his role of Vinnie Barbarino on the ABC sitcom ""Welcome Back Kotter"",had two prior megahit starring films,""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Grease"". In his third megahit,this film,he is Beauford Uan ""Bud"" Davis,an URBAN COWBOY who moves to Houston from Spur,a small Houston suburb. He lands a job at an oil refinery where his uncle Bob works. Debra Winger is Sissy,who Bud met at Gilley's,the real-life Pasadena,TX honky tonk. Bud and Sissy fall in love and get married at the hot nightspot. Scott Glenn is Wes Hightower,a paroled convict who steals Sissy's heart and keeps it while she and Bud are separated and nearly divorce. Madolyn Smith in her debut,at least on the big screen,is Pam who is Bud's girlfriend during the separation. Country singer Mickey Gilley owns the nightspot with Sherwood Cryer(both appear as themselves in the film). In addition to Gilley,country artists appearing in the film are Bonnie Raitt,Johnny Lee and The Charlie Daniels Band. All four artists have contributed to the soundtrack album. This film was directed by the late James Bridges,whose prior films include SEPTEMBER 30,1955 and THE CHINA SYNDROME. Bridges subsequently directed MIKE'S MURDER also starring Winger,PERFECT,also starring Travolta,and BRIGHT LIGHTS,BIG CITY starring Michael J. Fox. Sadly,Gilley's was burned down in 1989 by a kitchen fire and was later re-christened as Gilley's Mechanical Bull & Nightclub. Travolta would have no megahit films following this one until 1989's LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

910595,2,6304674228,"Running across this movie while channel surfing the other day brought back a flood of memories.
All of them bad.
Who can forget the ""Urban Cowboy"" craze shortly after this movie came out?  Drugstore cowboys in redneck country are bad enough, but once John Travolta hit the silver screen spitting chaw and scootin' a boot we saw city slickers from Manhattan to Medford putting on Stetsons and Tony Lamas--cowboy wannabes who couldn't two-step with the aid of a cattle prod.
And for what?  How could the film URBAN COWBOY inspire anything, other than indigestion?  Travolta and Debra Winger as ""Bud and Sissy"" (smile when ya say them names, pardner) are immature, self-absorbed, shallow, one-dimensional nitwits who tend to ""look for love in all the wrong places"" while they spend all their spare time at Gilley's ""three acres of concrete prairie"" and fight over which one is better riding a mechanical bull.  And while we're at it, let's throw in a Southwestern twang that makes Junior Samples sound like a Rhodes scholar.
""You a real cowboy, ain't ya?""
Feel free to overlook the boy-meets-girl-loses-girl-gets-girl-back plot; URBAN COWBOY is bad:  bad acting, unlikeable characters, mind-numbing music, laughable haircuts.  At least Scott Glenn, playing a seedy ex-con, is consistent--consistently bad.  He can drain the worm from a bottle of tequila and still last eight seconds on the mechanical bull.  Now that's a real cowboy.  Yee doggies.

910597,5,6304674228,"I was crushed to find that the DVD does not include certain key deleted scenes.  Perhaps that will be remedied after customer demand becomes known to the producers.  You will remember that Wes Hightower used the mechanical bull, at one point, to break Bud's arm at Gilley's.  Bud accordingly had to leave his job, since he was no longer capable of manual labor (""I'm sorry, Bud, I really am,"" the foreman told him) and he had to get fill-in work clerking at a convenience store.  There's a scene in the film where we briefly see Bud wearing the shirt from that convenience store job -- but one of the deleted scenes portrayed him doing behind-the-counter work, while Uncle Bob stopped by and asked how things were going.  In that vignette we saw John Travolta's indescribable acting -- the literal torture he wove into the Bud character who had lost his real job and was forced to perform demeaning 7-11 labor.  This casual deletion from the main movie probably cost Travolta the Academy Award that year... and now it's not even on the DVD.  What a shame.  However, we DO get to see Bud rehearsing the solo dancing he did so well at Gilley's, and we see Debra rehearsing on the bull, boy oh boy.  But one big question remains:  What was Sissy's maiden name?",1074470400,26,1257,4.571428571428571
910598,2,6304674228,"What is there to say about a film that features John Travolta in a cowboy hat and loads of awful honky tonk music? Not much. Let's just say that ""Saturday Night Fever"" this is not.
But still, it surprisingly created an entire fad of modern-day cowboys across the entire United States of America, which is a sad thing to think about, given that the film sucked to begin with. Honestly, why in the world would a movie like this inspire Americans to go out to their local city costume shops and dress up as urban cowboys? Apart from looking absolutely, astonishingly ridiculous, what else does this accomplish? The funniest thing about fads is that I often find they're started by stupid, stupid things.
Surprised as I was to see this being featured on AMC, I gave it a chance and can't find anything very commendable or recommendable. Riding the waves of 1977's smash hit, ""Saturday Night Fever,"" which of course starred John Travolta in that niiiice white suit, ""Urban Cowboy"" is about as close to a remake as one can get. Change the locations, change the co-stars, and change the music. It's all the same. This could be considered an unofficial sequel to the film if there weren't one already (the forgettable sequel to ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Staying Alive,"" directed by Sylvester Stallone, was even worse than ""Urban Cowboy,"" which is some sort of miracle).
Basically, the plot is this: Bud David (Travolta) moves out to the big city in order to visit his uncle. Once there, he goes to a country bar named Gilley's, where he meets and falls in love with Sissy (Debra Winger), who suddenly marries him and then gets in a fight with him after he sees her with a con man named Wes, who plans to rob Gilley's. Meanwhile, in the ""main plot"" of the film, Bud applies for a mechanical bull contest and tries to patch up his relationship with Sissy. That's basically the plot. No emotional underpinnings like ""Saturday Night Fever,"" no message about trying to break away from boredom and be someone--anyone--for a single night other than yourself.
Just dancing. Dancing, singing, and bad direction. In ""Saturday Night Fever,"" the dance floor was used as a backdrop. Sure, it was shown on screen a heck of a lot, but it was also used as a metaphor. Tony Manero wanted something more than the life he was living. Disco dancing was his one way out, his chance to be king for a night rather than schmuck for a lifetime.
None of this is present in ""Urban Cowboy,"" which is sort of sad. The film tries to make us feel for Travolta's character by using ancient plot cliches. And we're supposed to feel uplifted and inspired when he gains the respect of a bunch of boot-wearing, leather-laden, drunken cowboys? Whatever.",1074038400,5,2707,4.689075630252101

It's an entertaining film despite its simpering, too-cutesy women, cheesy trailer parks, and overabundance of testosterone. Having been raised a Yankee and a strict Catholic, and still both to this day, I found this movie to be an interesting introduction to a different culture the first time I watched it as a teenager. In contrast to my own austere culture, I saw Houston, Texas as a place were every man was a cowboy and could dance and charm women every bit as well as he could drink, brawl, and ride the mechanical bull.  As for the women, they were all flirty and outgoing, sins which the nuns in school cautioned us against.  And, the big shocker, most of the people lived in a trailer park and not in a twin home!  Imagine that! I would have dismissed the movie as merely a glorified saga of life in a white-trash world, but it was too engrossing.  Here we have Bud, struggling to make a new life in Houston at the oil refinery, and Sissy, the quintessential country girl who's the best dancer at her CW nightclub, where she meets Bud and succumbs to his charms.  Then there's Pam, the rich girl who can have anything and anyone she wants, and Wes, the charismatic ex-con who sets his hat at Sissy.  They and, it seems, all of Houston hang out at Gilley's, the aforementioned nightclub, where the fists, beer, two-steppers, and testosterone fly. I found the characters and the story to be too interesting to dismiss, even if the culture was vasty different from my own.

Whereas Mr. Travolta was perfectly cast as Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever, he seems out of place as Bud in this film.  The characters in the film, much like those in Saturday Night Fever, as working stiffs who escape the monotony of their lives by going to a bar to dance, drink and ride a mechanical bull.  Instead of a discotheque, the main hang out is a honky tonk called Gilley's (which is a real bar owned by country music singer Mickey Gilley).  The film revolves around the relationship of Bud and Sissy (played by a young Debra Winger) who meet at Gilley's.  They fall in love, get married, separate as each go on dalliances with others and in the end get back together.  While the film has some decent moments, the bull riding does get old after a while, a very fine soundtrack, it ultimately comes off as an attempt to recreate Saturday Night Fever and it doesn't succeed.",1034121600,3,1049,4.494736842105263

It is the story of one Bud Davis who moves to Houston from the rural country to find work at a huge power plant there. On his first night, ""Uncle Bob"", takes him to Gilley's, and he finds that ""Toto, we aint in Kansas anymore"", after waking up with Mick Jagger's ex, and some other woman, a night later. He finds that he likes Gilley's and his new job, and they go hand in hand, as you work hard at the plant all day, and then hang out at Gilley's after shift, to try and pick up sexy cowgirls. And that he does, in the guise of ""Sissy"", played by Debra Winger. It is , in my opinion, a realistic view of relationships, and all that can go wrong, involving issues of trust, lust, revenge, love and hate, and especially jealousy. It explores the relationships that happen when a marriage goes to hell....the other woman, the other man, ect, all centering around a mechanical bull, an ex-con, an incredibly sensual Madeline Stowe, bottles of Lone Star and Mesqual, and the big Bull riding contest.

In 1980, Urban Cowboy immortalized the name ""Gilley's"". The movie itself may not have the best special effects (if any at all) or the best storyline - but it's true to life, and could very well be the life story of a typical Pasadena, Texas ""oil hand"". John Travolta and Debra Winger are tremendous in their roles, capturing a true Texan accent and acting their roles extremely well. Anyone who negatively criticizes this movie is only showing their own futility - they obviously aren't a fan of either John Travolta or Debra Winger and probably have never taken the effort to read about the movie or ""The Worlds Greatest Honkey Tonk - Gilley's"".
