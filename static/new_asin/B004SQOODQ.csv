4464364,5,B004SQOODQ,"My four year old daughter adores this video--she loves doing the poses, sings along, and learns phonics at the same time (so I love it too:). I try not to let her watch too much tv, but this video is a different story--she exercises while stimulating her brain, so it's something I feel good about.  She's watching it right now and just yelled from the living room, ""Iguana starts with an I !!!!!""  I'd say that says it all!",1318982400,8,424,4.3544303797468356
4464365,5,B004SQOODQ,"This is a great yoga video for kids.  My son is 21 mos. and loves doing the poses with me.  It is a video that will grow with him- I could see him using it until he's at least 5 or 6 years old.  Ilappreciate that it also allows him to embody certain words- for example, he LOVES airplanes and the video shows him how to be an airplane and fly by lifting his back leg and stretching out his arms.  Sometimes he even wants to do the poses when we aren't watching the video!",1318032000,5,471,3.9263157894736844
4464366,4,B004SQOODQ,"My 2 year old really enjoys this disc. It is nice, though there is downtime between each letter and the poses don't really flow into a routine. Several of the poses are too difficult for both of my children (4 and 2) to do and there is not enough instruction from the children leading the poses. The pose for ""U"" is ""upside down"" which is quite advanced indeed! The boy who shares instruction with a girl may have a hearing disability which makes his voice a bit hard to understand. Several of the poses are quite similar, being on all fours, and are not necessarily traditional yoga poses. But it gets my kids moving instead of just sitting in front of the t.v.",1313280000,8,662,4.390243902439025
4464367,5,B004SQOODQ,"The Yoga with Phonics DVD was a clever way to enhance leaning alphabet and sounds by adding a physical movement component.  It not only helps the child with their physical fitness, it enhances retention by using the motor skills part of the brain to lock in the learning.  Using different aged child instructors and animal pictures was great.  The yoga postures were fun yet at an appropriate difficulty level.
I would definitely recommend this DVD!",1308960000,2,449,4.96
4464368,5,B004SQOODQ,"My children got this today, and just couldn't wait to get started! We put it on, and for the next 33 minutes they were totally enthralled. They loved how the Alphabet was connected to the different poses, and kept guessing what pose might go with the next letter in line! I've been nervous about how to keep them entertained this summer. I can say for sure that this video is going to provide them a with lot of entertainment, and me with a lot of peace of mind! I predict that they will request to do what they are already calling ""their workout"", every morning. My 5 year old daughter's favorite was ""W"", the Warrior Pose. My 8 year old son like ""U"" best. Even my toddler sat and watched and moved, trying to do the poses with his older siblings!

The overall quality of the video was very professionally finished and produced. The kids on the video are dynamic, animated, and engaging. This dvd is a very successful merging of educational material with fun. My kids didn't even know they were learning! All they know is, they loved it and want to do it again and again. I consider this video to be an investment in the health of my children, and I am already seeing a great ROI!!",1306713600,29,1182,4.372727272727273
4464369,5,B004SQOODQ,"This DVD is great!  It's a wonderful way to get your kids up, off the couch and going on some good exercise.  The quality of the video is well done.  The yoga moves are interesting, engaging and challenging.  This also gives parents a good way to exercise with their kids.  I heartily recommend this DVD!",1306195200,2,304,4.454545454545454
4464370,5,B004SQOODQ,I have never done any kind of Yoga before but a friend recommended this DVD for my kids.  My two preschoolers have done the workout regularly since we got it.  They even want to watch it in the car.  They already know most of their letters but it is a fun review and they are building balance and strength.  I think it's a great DVD.,1305936000,2,333,4.076923076923077
4464371,5,B004SQOODQ,Two years later my daughter still loves this and remembers the vowel chant.,1421539200,,75,4.846153846153846
4464372,5,B004SQOODQ,the children like the kid inter-activeness in the video,1417996800,,55,5.222222222222222
4464373,3,B004SQOODQ,"Teacher review: I love doing alphabet yoga with kindergarteners! This video is not my favorite alphabet yoga. In my classroom yoga is calm and quiet. this video encourages loud sounds like roars. If you do not have a yoga mat for students or another way for the students to easily define space several of the hopping poses can quickly get out of hand. The video starts our with a warm up that includes wild jumping that repeats again on the letter Y. There is no resting pose at the end. A resting pose, like corpse pose is essential for a calm transition to the next activity. The video does not leave the letter in the sight of the students as they are trying to copy the pose. With all that being said I do love the breathing excercises, especially the vowels. I would highly recommend the Number 1-20 yoga that is from this series. For an alphabet yoga take I would suggest the Beginning  level of I Can do Yoga. I give this video a C+!",1415750400,2,940,4.340909090909091
4464374,5,B004SQOODQ,"We've owned this DVD for almost 3 years now and my kids still love it!  My 6, 4 and 1.5 year old line up our yoga mats in the living room and are completely entertained for the entirety of show.  They have learned all of the poses and even the 1.5 year old shows off her moves when you ask her to do her yoga.  Great exercise for all those rainy days and I am able to get a few chores done while the kiddos are entertained.  Win and win!",1412812800,,437,3.8222222222222224
4464375,5,B004SQOODQ,Kind of a slower DVD. Great before nap time. My 2 1/2 year old loves it because it is just the children teaching and speaking not an adult. She seems to think that's cool.,1408406400,,171,4.0588235294117645
4464376,1,B004SQOODQ,"I thought it was boring and the boy seems to have a speech impediment.  My child who is 3 likes it a little, but does not seem interested in the animal moves.",1404259200,,158,3.9375
4464377,5,B004SQOODQ,"I bought this video for my 2.5 year old girl who is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. The video had enough to keep her interested (she loved the little song they sing with the letters) while not so much that would cause her to stim. We just watched it for the 2nd time and while she cant do poses yet (obviously), I do them along with the video and she is very intrigued by the display. The poses are fun and done in a pretend play format as the kids transform into a lion, velociraptor, zebra, rhino etc.",1402704000,,512,4.13
4464378,5,B004SQOODQ,"We love doing this d v d. The kids can do it every day without complaint. In fact they learn from it. My son started and complained that he couldn't do the head balance, but now after a month of practice, he can balance and stand on his head.",1397001600,,242,3.9591836734693877
4464379,5,B004SQOODQ,"My grandkids love this! From the 2 year old to the 5 year old, it's a great way to exercise and learn at the same time. A Healthy Choice!",1395532800,,137,3.7586206896551726
4464380,4,B004SQOODQ,My Daughter loves this. Even her brother gets in on it when she pops this dvd in.  We get our mats out and do it together. It's fun.,1389312000,,132,3.7142857142857144
4464381,5,B004SQOODQ,For toddlers and older kids this would be a hit..if I was still teaching I would do this daily. Great exercise habit.,1389225600,,117,4.363636363636363
4464382,5,B004SQOODQ,"I was skeptical on whether or not this could hold my very active 3-yr-old's attention, but it did!  She loved it!  Definitely recommend!  It is a very cute video that teaches the alphabet along with the yoga poses.  Each letter has an animal, etc. associated with it and the yoga they do corresponds with that animal, etc.  My daughter found it all just hilarious.",1388793600,,364,4.625
4464383,5,B004SQOODQ,My kindergarten class loved this DVD.  They enjoyed the yoga and acting like the different animals and also learned letter sounds while exercising!,1385596800,,147,5.391304347826087
4464384,5,B004SQOODQ,This is a fantastic yoga video! My kids are learning yoga & the alphabet at the same time. I bought it a year ago & am so pleased with it!,1378512000,,138,3.6333333333333333
4464385,3,B004SQOODQ,"Not bad, but we'er on letter ""p"" and both kids (2 & 4) have wandered away.  This is a very basic show.  It might be good near bedtime.  It's about 1 min spent on each letter showing a pose per letter.",1376784000,,200,3.8292682926829267
4464386,5,B004SQOODQ,"My kids love this dvd. I think it is because the video has 3 children, all of whom are of a different age groups. My toddlers seam to relate to the small girl, and when I watch my friends children who are 4 years older, they relate to the older kids. Ether way Its a great DVD, however some of the poses are a little hard for toddlers, but I guess they will learn them over time.",1375401600,,379,3.935064935064935
4464387,5,B004SQOODQ,"Good family time and great way to work on trick the kiddos into learning. movie uses song, pictures, and other children to host the video which really helps the kids to focus",1373587200,,174,4.46875
4464388,5,B004SQOODQ,"My daughter is 23-months and quite verbal and walks around now saying C is for Cat and Cow and will demonstrate several positions.  Some position demonstrations go quickly so you'd need to pause to practice some, but it is long enough to get all the letters in and her attention.  She is not successful in all the positions (well, most), but enjoys it!  There are 2 older children and 2 younger ones featured.  Great addition to our library!",1373328000,,441,4.615384615384615
4464389,5,B004SQOODQ,My 4-yr old niece is now a yoga addict.  She pulls the DVD out twice a day and gives special attention to her favorite animals.  good job.,1372809600,,138,4.074074074074074
4464390,5,B004SQOODQ,Personatily I think this video is cheesy however my daycare kids love it. Plus they can act like animals and learn their ABC's,1372118400,,126,4.521739130434782
4464391,5,B004SQOODQ,"My daughter absolutely loves this video.  she practices all the yoga moves and has even learned her vowels (she is two).  The songs are catchy, the kids are cute, the moves are fun, highly recommended as a great first yoga video.",1370908800,,229,4.560975609756097
4464392,1,B004SQOODQ,"Ordered this dvd over other kids yoga dvds because of the high reviews.  Wanted something that would get my children stretching and moving and into yoga a bit, I have my yoga and I wanted to give them something more their speed, and was excited for this to get here.  7yr old wants to learn yoga, 3yr old usually does what big sis does, and would learn more phonics at the same time.  This isn't it, they got bored right away and haven't wanted to play this since.  The directions the video gives for stretches and poses moves very slowly, and is too broken up by the phonics stuff.  I don't think they set it up to combine the two very well.  My 3yr old saw the lion on the cover and only wanted to see the lion.  So this is collecting dust. the dust is collecting dust!

I would rather the kids try to follow my yoga dvd, at least they can attempt poses and see how to flow them together.  Don't get the rave reviews of this one.",1368144000,,931,4.127777777777778
4464393,3,B004SQOODQ,"My 3 y.o. daughter seems amused by this DVD and will follow what the children do on occasion.  She mostly ends up just watching it (versus actually DOING the yoga).  The music keeps her interested though.  It's a little hard to understand some of what they're saying but overall it's a fun, beginner kid-yoga DVD.",1365379200,,313,4.654545454545454
4464394,5,B004SQOODQ,I bought this for my daughter and she LOVES IT!!! It's is very easy for here to understand and the learning aspect was fantastic for her mind as the yoga was for her body.,1361145600,,171,4.0588235294117645
4464395,4,B004SQOODQ,"Bought this to do w my 28 moth old daughter since she likes to ""excercise"" to my DVDs.  Many of the moves are difficult for her to execute properly, but she likes to try them.  She really enjoys it (asks to do it daily).  She especially likes the music sequence between each letter-she dances to that part.  I imagine an older child would be able to do all the moves.  It's nice that they have children as the ""instructors"".",1359244800,,424,4.3164556962025316
4464396,5,B004SQOODQ,My son started watching this video when was two.  He just turned three.  I loves the alphabet and phonics.  He sings along.  He is starting to do more yoga poses.  He likes it best when we do the poses together.,1358553600,,211,4.175
4464397,3,B004SQOODQ,"I looked and looked for a yoga DVD that I could do with my one year old and I couldn't find anything in the description about what ages this DVD is geared toward. My son, who is now two, likes the songs and pictures but its still too advanced for him. I wouldn't recommend this DVD unless your children are over four.",1357948800,2,317,4.129032258064516
4464398,5,B004SQOODQ,"My three, almost four, year old daughter tries yoga with me at home. I wanted to find a sequence aimed at children that would be more fun for her. She puts this DVD in her DVD player and does it herself. I like this DVD because it's children doing the poses, and the children lose their balances, so they aren't doing it perfectly either. I think this gives my daughter the confidence to keep trying. I recommend it to anyone with young children.",1357516800,2,446,4.385542168674699
4464399,5,B004SQOODQ,"My almost 3-year old boy loves this DVD and asks for it every day.  Some of it is a little advanced for his age, but he still likes the music, and he runs / dances around, even when he doesn't do the moves.  There are times he'll enjoy and do most of the moves for all 30 minutes, but I usually just put it on for about 5 - 10 mins. at a time, for him to do some stretching/exercising.  Don't get this if you want something with a calming effect...at least, it has the opposite on my son, anyway.  It riles him up, but it's a good treat for him, and, unlike standard TV, he can be active at the same time.  There's not a ton of learning going on, from what I can tell, but there are basic letter and phonic (and breathing) lessons intertwined throughout.",1354492800,,754,4.0675675675675675
4464400,4,B004SQOODQ,I purchased this video for my two-year old daughter because she likes to do yoga poses with me.  The poses are reasonably easy for her to follow and it gives her a little exercise.  She already knows her alphabet but this is an additional tool since there is a pose for every letter.  I would totally give this video five stars except for the incredibly irritating song preceeding every single letter.  It gets old after the letter 'A'.  There should be an option to skip the idiotic song.,1354406400,,489,4.511363636363637
4464401,5,B004SQOODQ,"I saw this as a recommendation when I was checking out another recommended ABC type yoga video. My 6 year son is having difficulty with phonics and reading in school and is a very active child and I was trying to find another way to help enforce and entertain him in a way I know Hooked on Phonics may not be able to do on it's own. Let me just say that this video delivered in a big way, not only did my 6 years stay attentive but my 8 year old also loved this video as well. I think that it has to do with the fact that this video contained children of various ages and my 8 year old could relate to the older kids while my 6 year old could relate to the younger kids. They each had a blast with the different poses, and although it did not have a flow like an adult yoga video, it works well for kids, who may get bored with a regular yoga routine. My son was singing along with the songs, and doing all the letter sounds with the different poses and the breathing exercise while learning the vowels is just brilliant. I don't think he had a clue that he was learning, and the very plus side was we did this in the evening just before bed and he was so worn out that he went to sleep with no problems.",1348444800,,1204,3.9588477366255144
4464402,5,B004SQOODQ,"This is a very straightforward and simple DVD.  It begins with some simple warmups.  Then, for each letter of the alphabet there's a little rhyme/song and a yoga pose.  I like the variety of difficulty in the yoga poses.  Some are very easy for my kids, and some are more of a challenge.  Both my 2 and 3 year old now have their own yoga mats because we watch this DVD so often!

The graphics/special effects are very basic.  Not enough to keep an adult interested - but an adult isn't the target audience.  It's perfect for young kids!",1347148800,3,536,4.343434343434343
4464403,1,B004SQOODQ,"When I bought this item, I hoped for a video with slow yoga poses. After all, this is for children. This video is too fast, with distracting interludes between each pose. They don't stay on a pose long enough to be called a pose",1346716800,2,228,4.204545454545454
4464404,5,B004SQOODQ,"This is a great intro to yoga and my 2 year old loves it!  The music is good, the postures are well chosen.  The practice is modeled by children with a voiceover by the author.",1343174400,,176,4.0
4464405,5,B004SQOODQ,"Our daughter is not even two and a half and she LOVES this video!!!! words cannot express how awesome this video is and the feeling you get from watching your child doing this video and then running around yelling ""baby yogi....baby yogi"" and learning a healthy activity that is a source for a lifetime of knowledge.... this might just be the greatest thing we have EVER got off amazon",1343088000,,385,4.594202898550725
4464406,3,B004SQOODQ,"My three year old really likes this DVD.  However, so far it hasn't encouraged her to do much yoga.  It moves too fast for her to understand and make most of the poses, so instead she dances around and does a pose here or there.  I think the DVD is overall effective in getting kids excited about yoga, but it drives me crazy.  I have tried to do yoga with my daughter, but the pace is too fast for me most of the time, too.  So, it's just okay, but like I said, watching it gets her excited and moving.",1338508800,9,503,3.99
4464407,5,B004SQOODQ,"My autistic daughter is 4, with very low muscle tone, so we got this in an effort to work more physical-therapy-type activities into her day.

I'll tell you quite honestly, I find the DVD irritating. There is this cutesy little phonics song that plays between every single letter, like ""B-A bay, B-E bee, B-I bicky-bi..."" and it gets old fast. Plus one of the kids has a speech impediment like Elmer Fudd (""weach for yoah toes, then stwetch to the sky..."") BUT, my daughter LOVES it. The repetition of the music is appealing to her, plus of course she has an obsession with the alphabet so she really likes associating each position with a letter. The kids on the screen often wobble and stumble, which I think makes it less intimidating.

At first she wouldn't do any of the positions, but she kept requesting to watch it and by the fourth or fifth viewing she was doing every move through the whole thing. Now she does it at least once a day, without any prompting to move from one pose to the next. Which means I can leave the room and not listen to the music! :) A huge success.",1338076800,18,1082,4.405
4464408,5,B004SQOODQ,My daughter (5) and I are enjoying this DVD. I like the way they incorporated the phonics sounds and repeated the sounds in rhyme. She enjoys the DVD and watching real kids do the poses. It is wonderful that real children lead the DVD not adults. It gives my daughter more confidence that she can do the poses as long as she keeps practicing. I highly recommend!!!,1337644800,6,364,4.447761194029851
4464409,5,B004SQOODQ,This video is great for my 4 year old!  She loves to watch while I practice and now she has her very own workout.  The poses are basic but fast paced enough to help release extra energy.  Some days we play the video 3 times in a row!,1336867200,3,233,3.8125
4464410,5,B004SQOODQ,"Fun, Fun, Fun! Learning the alphabet while you ""exercise.""  My soon to be 4 year old loves this DVD! We get to learn her letters and move.  It can seem slow for me since it incorporates the letters before each new pose but my girl loves it.  Since each letter has a distinct pose we can practice ANY time. If we are practicing writing her name at her desk, we take a break and ""Yoga"" write her name for a mini break.

The best review: When she wakes up in the mornings she asks if we can go do our yoga. It's a hit!

Biggest drawback - There is one pose that is VERY advanced but they show a little tyke that doesn't master the pose. Even with that illustration my daughter gets VERY upset that she can't do the headstand thingy (heck - I can't do it either)",1326153600,6,758,4.060402684563758
8440133,5,B004SQOODQ,She really enjoys that children teach the movements. It's a simple format with a repetitive song and different movement with each letter. It's a lot of fun and gets kids to do poses and animal movements. Well worth the buy!,1456790400,,223,4.6

8440139,4,B004SQOODQ,"My daughter loves this video! She especially loves the songs in-between yoga moves, as she likes to move around a this age (2 1/2), but she likes trying out the different poses too. It's perfect for the younger set since it does involve a lot of movement and doesn't requite them to do a pose for too long, so it's a great introduction to yoga, even though there isn't a whole lot of actual yoga involved. I also like the phonics element to this, although I do agree with other users that since it is a phonics related video, the children in it should be able to speak clearly and correctly without any speech impairments (this wouldn't be an issue if it were not specifically a phonics item).",1435968000,,693,4.421875
