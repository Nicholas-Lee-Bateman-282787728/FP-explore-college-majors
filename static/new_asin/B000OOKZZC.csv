8185729,3,B000OOKZZC,"While I appreciated seeing some of the animated shorts I remembered from the original ""Animation Celebration"" (waaaay back when I was in college), this disc was missing the specific animated short film I was looking for when I ordered this DVD:  ""The Wreck of the Julie Plante.""  The only reason I ordered this disc was to get my hands on a copy of ""The Wreck of the Julie Plante,"" for use in a college class I am teaching.

Despite my disappointment, however, I would recommend this for people interested in late-Soviet era animation from ""behind the Iron Curtain,"" as there are a few offerings in that area (""Come Back to Sorrento"" comes to mind).  As far as I can tell, this disc includes only the first eleven films on the ""Animation Celebration, vol. 1"" list:

Auguszta szepitkezik (1983)
'Cat and Mouse' at the Home (1983)
Karakters, De (1986)
Pileto (1982)
Come Back To Sorrento
Disconnected (1988)
Happy Hour (1983)
Quasi's Cabaret Trailer (1980)
Mongo Makongo (1986)
Quest: A Long Ray's Journey Into Light (1986)
Kuku (1983)

If, like me,  you are searching for any of the others, you will have to look elsewhere.  Sigh.",1384992000,,1129,4.783505154639175
8185730,4,B000OOKZZC,"The list given by Jamco2000 is correct. This contents of this DVD are taken from an old VHS tape, called the 'Animation Celebration Video Collection Vol. 1.' The shorts were entered in an animation fesitval. While I wouldn't call them inappropriate, they're not aimed at children.

The disc contains some great cartoons - 'Cat and Mouse' is an homage to the old Tom and Jerry cartoons, 'Broken Down Film,' by famous Japanese animator Osamu Tezuka, features characters interacting with the various 'imperfections' in the film. The short 'Pileto,' actually called Nunemo the Chicken, features an ending you won't see coming.

A lot of these can be watched on Youtube, but several of them are unavailable elsewhere - Pileto, Come Back to Sorrento, Happy Hour, Mongo Makongo, Kuku, Sunbeam, The Wreck of the Julie Plante, and Moebius Play.

There are a few problems with this DVD - it has occasional VHS problems, since it was copied from one, and it only has two chapter stops. Also, on my old DVD, Broken Down Film would sometimes appear and sometimes not. I'm not sure if this is an issue with all of the discs, or just mine.

In short, if you want something nice for the kids, this isn't for you. But if you want to see some lost treasures of experimental and independent animated films, this (as well as 'Animation from Around the World' and 'Great Animation' 1 & 2) is the DVD for you! :)",1358726400,,1390,4.684426229508197
8185731,2,B000OOKZZC,"I was rather disappointed not just with the poor quality of this DVD, but because it didn't really meet my expectations. I enjoy these animated short festivals very much and was hoping to view these in high definition and have access to an interactive menu. I have the same compilation on video, but I wanted to see if there was a DVD format so I could replace it.",1344038400,,364,4.367647058823529

8185733,1,B000OOKZZC,"I have never before in my life seen a DVD of short subjects that offers absolutely NO WAY to access each film. The program of many short films is presented in 2 45-minute ""lumps"", which makes me wonder if it was copied from a 2-sided laserdisc. But don't expect laserdisc quality--the picture is very fuzzy, like it's a couple of generations removed from the source.

The collection is one I had back in the 80s, which I got rid of because there's nothing on it really worth seeing a second time. I said in the review title that it's not suitable for kids because at least 2 films end with suicide. These are experimental and ""art"" films aimed at adults.

I will be careful in the future to avoid DVDs from ""East West Entertainment"" company.",1195084800,3,741,4.481481481481482
