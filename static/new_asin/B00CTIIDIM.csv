8586086,5,B00CTIIDIM,"Hard to find on DVD. I had a VHS version with a busted hinge. So getting my claws on this was a relief. It will only play in a Region 2 (3?) player, which is a pain in the you know what. But if you like movies like this, you probably own a Region 2 or 3 player. Buy this while it's available! See, there's this giant walrus that threatens the project to build huge rocket motors on the South Pole in order to shove the Earth out of the way of an oncoming planetoid... great stuff. And this DVD is, obviously, in Japanese. Nothing is worse than suffering through a pan-and-scan badly-dubbed Japanese sci-fi movie. It's a delight being able to find a movie like this on a quality DVD release.",1402876800,,690,4.234848484848484
