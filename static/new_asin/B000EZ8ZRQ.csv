2546975,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,"This is one of his better movies based on a Louis L'Amour.  It shows both strong men & women, not gunmen in the west.",1283644800,,117,3.875
2546976,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,I enjoyed this story very much. I thought it was the kind of movie that left you wanting more at the end and full of suprises.,1258588800,3,126,3.8846153846153846
2546977,4,B000EZ8ZRQ,"If you like Westerns and, have read Louis L Amour Books, you will enjoy this movie. It follows the book as close as most movies do. There's one thing I wouldn't want to do and that's to watch the Movie and then try to write a Book report for a class in school. It just might not Fly.
The Railroad man",1250640000,2,300,3.9344262295081966
2546978,4,B000EZ8ZRQ,"There is reference to a part 2 and couple months back watched the 2nd part where his old boss finding out where he had got to came west making the whole story as in the book or god forgive there is a 2nd disc?
Cued my dish-TV to search for it every other week.
Besides like the Croc's girlfriend and historical contribution",1229040000,,323,4.225806451612903
2546979,3,B000EZ8ZRQ,"I bought this movie for my husband who is a huge Louis L'Amour fan.  This movie was so short (90 minutes)and left out so much of the story--- having read the book he just couldn't believe it.  The acting was good, the story clean but they really didn't develop the charaters very well.  It was almost a comedy.  At the end it was like we needed to turn over the DVD to get part two.  Too bad becasue my husband said it was one of his favorite L'Amour books.  Now I am going to read the book to get the entire story.  If you've never read the book you'll like this movie.
My hope is that someone else makes a movie on this same book.  THE IRISH MUSIC IS WONDERFUL!",1215302400,27,663,4.046153846153846
2546980,4,B000EZ8ZRQ,"I always enjoy anything connected to Louis Lamour and this was a good movie
over all. However they changed so much from the book that it took away from the pleasure of watching it.  I do so like the ""period"" dress and scenes. Makes one feel like we are truely peering into the past.  If you have not
read the book it should be a good movie. I feel that the director change and cut too much in the interest of time and the story line did not get properly developed.",1187827200,,464,4.087912087912088
2546981,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,"Good wholesome family entertainment, we could easily watch with our grandchildren and have no fear of filthy language, etc. Love this movie, but the end leaves one hanging, is there another part to it?",1180224000,15,201,4.9411764705882355
2546982,1,B000EZ8ZRQ,"I'm not sure these other two could have possibly watched the same movie as I! Poor directing, horrible editing, high school camera work, and of course, ridiculous acting, this movie had it all. I took an early day from work, picked up a movie, within twenty minutes I had no choice but to turn it off.  It was so bad I went back to work just to punish myself!!",1164844800,4,360,4.217391304347826
2546983,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,This movie is an atypical east coast meets wild west romp as only Louis L'Amour can tell. Strong cast with a few faces from HBO's Deadwood and Carnivale (sans the strong language). It is an untraditional story of a marshall on the frontier told in classic western style. I really enjoyed it and could show the entire family this movie without blushing!,1152057600,25,352,4.693548387096774
2546984,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,"FIVE STARS FOR NOT HAVING THE F*** WORD EVERY 10 SECONDS.

FIVE STARS FOR NOT HAVING THE F*** WORD PERIOD.

FIVE STARS FOR NOT HAVING THE M***** F****** WORD PERIOD.

FIVE STARS FOR NOT HAVING IMMORALITY, CHEATING, CUSSING, AND JUST PLAIN FILTH.

THIS MOVIE MUST HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE PLANET HTRAE (earth spelled backwards, BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS

FROM CONTEMORARY HOLLYWOOD TRASH OF IMMORALITY AND JUST PLAIN FLITH.",1151366400,10,436,5.084507042253521
2547005,1,B000EZ8ZRQ,"Same characters as the book but that's about all. If you are a Louis L'Amour fan DON'T watch this movie, you will be disgusted by the turned around characters, fair to bad acting and semi comedic tone of the movie. This one is almost as bad as ""Guns of the Timberlands"" and ""Cancel my reservation"" (The Broken Gun), NONE of these movies stuck to the book story line.",1390262400,,366,4.397058823529412
2547006,2,B000EZ8ZRQ,"If you loved the book, you will hate the movie. Why they feel the need to mess with a good story is beyond me. The story is at least 50% different than the book and not for the better.",1384387200,,184,3.7435897435897436
2547007,3,B000EZ8ZRQ,"I bought this movie because Louis L'Amour wrote the book its based on. That is all you can say about it.  It is based on the book, they really move away from the original storyline.  Its rather obvious from the threads they left hanging that this was intended to be the pilot show for a series.  The acting was good, and the quality of the production was awesome. If you've never read the book you'll like this movie.  If you have read the book and enjoyed it, don't buy this movie.  All it will do is upset you.

I really hope somebody remakes this movie and sticks to Mr. L'Amour's story.",1376956800,9,590,4.27027027027027
2547008,1,B000EZ8ZRQ,"Hollywood does it again. They took a rich plot with complex characters and turned it into mush. If they were working on a budget, it couldn't have been much more than my budget for gasoline. My advice, for those who like the cinema, is to read the book or watch ""Hondo"" or ""Conagher"" to learn how to turn a Lamour text into a movie.",1374796800,,332,4.203125
2547009,2,B000EZ8ZRQ,"I don't understand why they didn't add another 20 minutes to the film and tie up all the loose ends. It could have been a 4 star movie. Good story,good cast,and good transfer,but it leaves you hanging without an ending.....",1369353600,,223,4.6
2547010,2,B000EZ8ZRQ,"I didn't care for this movie beacuse the story plot was inconsistent The lead man was not convincing and the ending was lousy.
An old tv pilot and you can see why it didn't make it",1368057600,,180,4.027777777777778
2547011,4,B000EZ8ZRQ,A nice reward for those Louis L'Amour fans who like movies to go with L'Amour's books.  This is not a typical western but deals with boxing which was an important part of western history.,1358899200,,187,4.5
2547012,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,"I had a copy of this at some point in the past, however it left out some essential scenes. This copy had those deleted scenes which made the entire movie make sense. I received the movie in what I considered a quick length of time. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Louis L'Amour fan.",1349481600,,292,4.140350877192983
2547013,2,B000EZ8ZRQ,"As a faithful adaptation of a Louis L'Amour novel this was a shabby effort. As one reviewer noted much of the essentials of the original story were omitted. What was left was barely recognizable. As a western story that stands on its own, apart from Louis L'Amour, this movie was below average & not very interesting. A major sub-plot was left unresolved, and minor questions left unanswered. The acting in the movie was shallow for the most part & far removed from the depth of characters developed by Louis L'Amour, even in his short stories.",1330732800,,544,4.7368421052631575
2547014,2,B000EZ8ZRQ,"So far this is the most stupidest movie I have been dumb enough to buy, I'm a Louis L'Amour's fan, but I'm sure glad I missed this one !!!!  not even sure what would help this movie besides burning it. at least the disk is good for a frisbee, or target practice.",1288828800,,262,4.038461538461538
8115892,4,B000EZ8ZRQ,"Good movie. But after all the build-up I'd heard on it from others, I was a bit disappointed with it. Definitely not one of the Best adaptations of L'Amour's books. Glad I didn't buy one of the high priced dvds from shops representing it as a rare and collectible piece.",1507161600,,270,4.42
8115893,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,Was upset when saw package as it was quite damaged and the DVD case was beyond repair.  But the DVD was saved. And the movie is worth watching.,1476576000,,143,4.107142857142857
8115894,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,"Wasn't as good as the book, but ok",1473811200,,34,3.375

8115896,3,B000EZ8ZRQ,Not a bad movie.,1443916800,,16,3.25
8115897,2,B000EZ8ZRQ,"A bit of a disappointment. I own practically all of Louis L'Amours books. The drawback in this movie began with Matthew Settle playing  an unconvincing Irishman. The clothing Linda Kozlowski wore as Marla, the saloon owner were really 20th Century sax Fifth Avenue. The story just meandered with no really connection between portions  of Shaugnesy's personal odyssey. The crime was murky at best, the motives very unclear. The climax was too open ended. And it seems the characters passed too fleetingly for the viewer to get to know them or see any contrast. I think a different cast and a more tighter and sustaining story line could have rescued this film from the mediocrity, I consign it to.",1432598400,,696,4.889830508474576
8115898,4,B000EZ8ZRQ,"Very well done, close to the book.",1423094400,,34,4.0
8115899,4,B000EZ8ZRQ,My husband has about all of Louis Laomour books and anything I find in video I purchase since he doesn't read much anymore. But he loves watching the movies.,1420675200,,157,4.448275862068965
8115900,1,B000EZ8ZRQ,The only thing this movie had in common with the book was the title and even that was only halfway done right,1419206400,,109,4.0
8115901,5,B000EZ8ZRQ,A good western. Bought it for my father in law.,1414108800,,47,3.8
