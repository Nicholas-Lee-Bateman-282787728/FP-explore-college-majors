8757877,4,B01E6K8TC0,loved it. deals with even the hard stuff about love. not always easy endings. (as a person who has had some disablitity but still cares about the environment i still believe only issue is could it be a paper straw?. too many plastics in the world),1532908800,,247,4.391304347826087
8757878,5,B01E6K8TC0,"I was born with cerebral palsy and I CRINGE whenever I see movies about disability because they're always full of inspiration porn (look that up if you don't know what I mean) and terrible quality. I had the honor of seeing this movie before it was released at the Indian film festival in NYC before it came to America and it made me full on sob. Best disability movie I've ever seen and I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE THAT KALKI KOECHLIN DOES NOT HAVE CEREBRAL PALSY. Her acting is astonishing. But as a fellow CP-er, this movie hit me in all of my soul.",1513036800,2,547,4.320388349514563

8757880,4,B01E6K8TC0,"The text in the final credits would lead one to believe this film was extremely person for someone involved in its making. I think we take for granted being born without the additional challenges that come from having a physical or mental disability. We take for granted the gift and ability to walk through life relatively unnoticed for it. There is something that resonates very much with the struggle to be perceived and feel ""normal."" A lot of people spend their lives in pursuit of some abstract standard of what life is suppose to be/mean. Laila is not immune from this. I made the mistake of reading the one negative review on here of this film prior to watching it. Although her choices weren't always the best, that is a part of learning and growing up. Ultimately, I enjoyed the movie. It offers perspective, which is something we can all benefit from now and again.",1483660800,,876,4.658064516129032

8757883,5,B01E6K8TC0,"What a wonderful surprise of a movie! I hate using the term ""coming of age"" movie, but this really was. The protagonist through self discovery, learns how to navigate through life. Although she has cerebral palsy, and at times you can feel her sadness at being confined to a wheel chair, she is still able to learn about love, loss, heart ache and in the end TRULY finds herself. Really enjoyed watching this!",1473984000,,409,4.616438356164384
8757884,1,B01E6K8TC0,"This is the second worst movie I've ever seen in my life, to explain why however is complicated. A story with an unlikable character is fine, Scott Pilgrim was one of the freshest offerings we've seen in recent cinema and the title character couldn't be more of a pathetic jerk. Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans was a story entirely about a maniac cop who uses and brutalizes others and how the system allows people like him to exist.

Laila, the film's protagonist, is selfish, moody, pitiful, takes advantage of her disability, consistently and effortlessly avoids consequence or karmic retribution for her horrible behavior and in the end, having learned nothing, having gained nothing and having treated the people around her like garbage, she learns to love herself, which is represented metaphorically by, no joke, having Laila end the film by going on a date with herself and giggling flirtatiously at herself in a mirror.

Bad Lieutenant this is not, the story goes out of its way to paint Laila as a beautiful human being despite her numerous short-comings and lack of any redeeming quality besides the inherent sadness behind being physically handicapped and then ends by having the people around her reaffirm their happiness with her and having her realize the deep love she's learned to allow herself.

The film is riddled with countless other flaws, writing that seems to rely on cinematography to tell its story and cinematography that is unclear and obfuscated. Shonali Bose seems to be a sort of anti-Christopher Nolan in her incompetence at relaying vital information. Scenes appear and disappear with no function, even as introspection or down-time. Characters are introduced and dropped having plenty of screen-time and no influence on the plot, which is thin enough as is, then leaving without explanation. The director is so frightened by the idea of having a tense scene for even a moment that the movie will drop levity into a scene the very moment a character is given a tough situation or bad news, just so the audience doesn't feel uncomfortable for even a second.

But every single complaint, big or small, that I could lob at the movie is overshadowed by the writer's crippling love and forgiveness for a character who has an ugly heart.

This is not the indie masterpiece that's going to bring much needed representation to cerebral palsy. It's not cultural touch-stone that will introduce or represent Indian culture or cinema to international audiences to any meaningful degree. It's a selfish fantasy by this generation's worst independent screenwriter.

It's free on Netflix. Give it a try if you must, but I can't warn you against it enough.",1472601600,,2683,5.004484304932736
8757885,5,B01E6K8TC0,"This film tells the story of love, life, heartbreak and self-discovery in such a beautiful way. I love how the writers forced the viewers to see Laliah beyond her disability. We see her get her heart broken, as well as watch her break others hearts. We see her prey on people, as opposed to seeing people prey on her (which is how the story-line usually goes when there's a disable character playing a lead role), but with ""Margarita with a Straw"", there's a consistent growth that's happening throughout the film. Even during the parts where Laliah's actions and choices made me HELL'A MAD AT HER, I still felt like she was doing things she HAD TO DO in order to grow and find her true self. So, all-N-all this was a FANTASTIC movie, imo... and I will definitely be buying this for me lgbt movie collection:-)",1470355200,3,810,4.554794520547945
