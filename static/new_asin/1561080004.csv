183076,2,1561080004,"I got this movie after reading the reviews here.  I was very disappointed.  I'm giving this two stars only because of the message it conveys.  If not for that I would give it 1 star.  I know this was done in the 70's, but it seemed to me that it was rushed.  Too much of the book was missed.  I felt the chanting was rather distracting, espically when the movie was beginning to peak.  I thought the animated version (even though it is slow) was much better.  I really hope that someone does another movie and or even a mini series, that way they can touch on the whole book.",1184976000,5,575,4.163636363636364
183077,5,1561080004,"I first saw this film version of the famous allegory when it first came out in the late '70s and had wanted to see it again.  I was surprised upon buying the DVD last year to learn that Liam Neeson, now famous, was one of the stars.  Though nothing replaces the reading of the book, this was a well-made film representation for the techniques available at the time.  The scene of what happens to Pilgrim's burden as he approaches the Cross is worth the price of the DVD.",1177286400,35,470,4.318181818181818
183078,5,1561080004,"If you've never read John Bunyan's timeless classic ""Pilgrim's Progress""... you should. And THEN view this well done translation of it to film. I say this because like all movies based on a book, it cannot possibly convey it fully.

It's also a collector's item having the now famous Liam Neeson  playing the starring role of ""Pilgrim"" in it. And here, as in his role in ""Krull""; he shows all the usual rough edges of an actor yet new to the business, yet convincing enough to be a ""diamond in the rough"".

Fast action movie fans will find it a bit dull and tedious for their tastes. Yet considering the venerability of the subject matter, should not readily dismiss it either.

For Parents: This is definitely a ""Must Own"", being both morally instructive, and cinematically entertaining.",1162080000,66,788,4.772058823529412
183079,1,1561080004,"im sure the producer of this film had good intentions in mind,but surely the film was far from good. It is a shame that nobody has been able to portray this magnificent work of art into a quality motion picture such as that wich we find in the book. I long for the day that a quality producer will take notice of this story and bring it to life for millions to enjoy. I believe that this story in the right hands will far surpass the action, intensity, and amazement of any film in times past. The lord of the ring was an brilliant piece but the pilgrims progress is so far beyond it. The  producer of this piece obviously did not have the mind nor the resourses to bring this story to life.",1069545600,4,691,4.156716417910448
183080,5,1561080004,"I own several hundred movies, mostly comedies and adventure films, almost all of which are box office hits.  Pilgrim's Progress remains my number one favorite movie of all time.  No other allegory is as hard hitting as this one.  Cinematography-wise it doesn't rate high.  But the message is unparalleled.  I've read the unabridged book many times, my favorite reading next to the Bible.  I first saw it in a youth group over 20 years ago and it inspired me to read the book.  No, it isn't as good as the book but what movie is?  Still, the movie adds some nice twists that wouldn't translate well in printed form such as Pilgrim's penchant for falling into trouble every time he takes a trail that turns left.  Nice touch.  I'm sorry more people don't see this movie for what it is.  And Liam Neeson did an admirable job in his first movie role.  So, just what is the movie about?  A ""pilgrim"" is very troubled and not sure why.  But he knows he must leave his City of Destruction.  His family doesn't want him to go but his conscience won't allow him to stay.  He has heard a few words of scripture such as ""Flee from the wrath that is to come"".  So he begins his journey...a literal journey...to the Celestial City.  Along the way he meets many interesting characters such as Obstinate.  All of the names fit the characters.  Evangelist (played by Liam Neeson) points him in the right direction and gives him a key that will unlock any lock.  On his way to the Gatekeeper he falls into the Slough of Despond and then into Doubting Castle where many believers have perished.  But he persists.  The real tearjerker in the movie is when he has an encounter with Jesus at the Cross.  Words are not exchanged but when he sees Jesus, the burden that has been on his back up to this point suddenly falls off his back and he now has a Bible in his hands.  It just gets better from there.  His name is no longer Pilgrim but now Christian.  He meets a companion on the way and they become good friends as they enter the city Vanity Fair.  Here his companion becomes a martyr.  Cover your children's eyes at this point, the scene of flesh being burned off of his body is disturbing.  Eventually Christian comes to the point of entering the Celestial City.  But to get there he must pass through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.  John Bunyan's book comes to life in this movie in a way that I believe does the book justice.",1068508800,18,2416,4.395927601809955
183081,5,1561080004,"I was a missionary in the 80s in Honduras, CA.  I had this film on 16mm in those days.  I carried it into the Mosquita Jungle and it was always the favorite of any that I had!  I have seen hundreds get saved in a village showing this film.  When Pilgrim comes to the cross and the feet of Jesus and gets saved, the burden on His back breaks free and rolls away down the hill.  I was never in a village that the whole village didn't get up and cheer at this point!  Obviously, those reviews I read about how bad it was, came from people who only looked at the surface and missed the spiritual power of the movie!  I am looking to buy one in spanish and english in VHS so that I can continue to use it!  I have been working in Africa for the last 15 years and recently have begun to work in Central America again.  I look forward to the souls that will be saved using this film.

183082,1,1561080004,"We have read the book as a family and individually several times, and this is definately not faithful to Bunyan. It has been several years and I still have the nasty taste the tape  left in my mouth - so bad we sent it back to the seller.  If you can find the old animated version, it is much better if you can get by the primitive animation. I have not seen the new version, (Dangerous Journey), but it would have to try really hard to be worse than this. The film takes most of the characters in which Bunyan desires to teach us lessons about faith and human nature, and morphs them all into Satan. The ending is real televanglist-style evangelism, with Satan in an old graveyard pointing out the ones he got.

183095,1,1561080004,"I am Christian. I've always enjoyed ""The Pilgrim's Progress.""It is a story that the cinema should portray as a compelling adventure, full of drama, action, emotion, grit, sweat, blood and beauty.
Which means I cannot begin to express the fullness of my justified anger at this film for what it has done to a great story. It has no artistic imagination. The characters are emotionless and simply there as placeholders. The part of Pilgrim/ Christian requires varied emotional expression, from being on the verge of a mental meltdown to the euphoria of reaching the celestial city. The scenery is uninspiring and the choice of George Beverly Shea as the narrator boggles my mind.
Essentially, they made this to dupe gullible Christians into spending money on something they will support because of the message (and GBS too, nice cheap marketing device there) know most of us are satisfied with garbage so long as it claims to be Christian.
Sorry, Christian Film Industry- you can't fleece this Christian.
I could do better with a webcam and a few friends than what this travesty had done.

However, when we purchased this DVD set, it didn't have the same kind of pizazz that the book had.  The narration was sluggish and the children did not find much interest to hold their attention.  It didn't hold mine very well either.  I was hoping that it would be like the film that we saw a few years back as a church rental movie.  Unfortunately, it was not.

183103,2,1561080004,"I've seen two other Ken Anderson films: the biopic Fanny Crosby and the novel adaptation In His Steps which were both fairly good  However, Pilgrim's Progress was a case of a producer whose reach exceeded his grasp.

The best things about the movie was its exterior location work. There's some very pretty scenery here. The scene with Christian's conversion is fairly well-done as is the all too brief scene with Mister Interpreter. Future Oscar nominee Liam Nesson makes his film debut here and isn't bad which is more than can be said for the rest of the cast. While the documentary style introduction to John Bunyan seems odd for a dramatic movie, it was interesting.

Unfortunately, the film is haunted by obviously low budget, bad acting, and awful directing. It's clear this was a one camera film and the decision was made to film a lot of the back of people's head while they walked. Also decided was that that what Pilgrim's Progress needed was voices creepily chanting scripture verses at various times in the film. The worst decision of all was to have one actor (Maurice O'Callaghan) play all the evil parts. (I was reminded of the old TV show Rocky and Bullwinkle and Boris Badenov. ""Haven't I seen you before?"") O'Callaghan gives one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen. As Apollyon he appears by the side of the roads to chew up scenery and look down menacingly on our pilgrims in the most campy absurd way possible with a cape to play peekaboo behind and alternately long nails or black painted short nails.

Pilgrim's Progress as a book is a classic filled with remarkable imagery and teaching some powerful spiritual lessons. In the history of fiction, it's a pioneering work of imagination from an unexpected source. This film fails spectacularly to live up to the source material. The resulting film is dull waste of 72 minutes that rarely manages to inspire unless you like pretty landscapes.",1423353600,3,1924,4.821212121212121

183113,5,1561080004,"I have to admit, it is a little slow moving. The acting seems a little corny. But in it's defense, the book was written when there was no TV, or Netflix or Amazon Prime. Also, keep in mind the reading level of most people in that time was low and so it goes on to explain to a simple folk the value of such a difficult journey. It's a story of a man, maybe just like yourself, who decides to want to know and please the God of the Bible. It portrays the perils, distractions and temptations this young man will go through on his journey towards Salvation and Sanctification. The man, Pilgrim by name, is played by Liam Neeson. I think it is his first film. If you've read the book, you will appreciate the movie more. But even in it's simplicity, you will empathize with what Pilgrim goes through to ""arrive"" into the ""Kingdom of God"", a little hard to grasp, but worth the time. I love it, my wife doesn't.

I think the fools of Toledo, Ohio mocking my Christian beliefs reminded me of the evil immoral mockers at the town called Vanity Fair. Toledo also has a recognized whore problem in the news.

7796161,3,1561080004,"I like the newer version better, but even in that one, the acting is not good. I wish someone would remake this movie with real actors. It is still worth watching because the story is so good.",1497312000,,192,4.216216216216216
7796162,5,1561080004,"This was one of the original movies of Pilgrims Progress that touch on the major highlights of the book that was written about it in the '70's.
Full length movies were many reels long or about 6 hours.
For better viewing lighten the screen to 'vivid' or brighter as it was filmed a tad too dark,at least for my viewing.

Pilgrims Progress is always considered second to the Bible as it shows an excellent overview of the Christian walk in a nutshell.

Excellent views of green Ireland topography,period costumes and buildings.",1496793600,,526,4.769230769230769

7796167,3,1561080004,"It's okay, seemed short with mediocre acting. Still some spiritual truths to be learned here, I guess I just expected more. In comparison to ""Dangerous Journey"" by Michael Cramer, think it lacks depth. I recommend Dangerous Journey by far over this version. The major difference between the two is live actors vs still photo animation in Dangerous Journey. Time for someone to remake this with modern special effects!",1482364800,,417,5.147058823529412
