Ellen Burstyn was fabulous!  Mitch Albom is one of my favorites and I would recommend that every one see this moving, insightful film.

Author's other two books, where casted much better. Left me wanting to know why they picked this actor as the main character? Still, anything related to Mitch Albom is exception and true. Worth watching. Every adult child should read and watch this movie. Highlights a mother's selflessness love for her children.",1223164800,,450,4.934210526315789
3128744,2,B0014BQR7E,"If you like movies where you read the back cover and can almost predict the entire screenplay, this one is for you.  It is NOT a challenging film.  Its a shame, because the premise of spending one more day with a deceased loved one is a potentially rich theme.  However, this film makes no attempt to be anything more than entertainment  suited for the lifetime channel. The attempts to tug on the heart strings are way too blatant and cheesy.

There is one positive note, however.  When you see Chick as a young ball player in the minor leagues and on the Mets, you should get a decent laugh.  He looks absolutely ridiculous.  The baseball scenes are some of the worst I have ever seen; so bad in fact its funny.",1219276800,,713,4.3893129770992365

It just too boring and slow.  I love, I mean love, Ellen Burstyn and her performance was good. Yet the film moves too slowly. I love the theme of the film so much. O' my God just imagine getting one more day with your loved one. That's my favorite part of the film. The flash backs are too long and it causes the film too drag and it becomes too predictable. There should have been more concise editing. On this DVD I found the sound to be very poor. In the scenes with the mother I had to turn my HD TV volume almost too max. What could have been a great film never quite makes it past first base and unfortunately strikes out.",1213488000,6,795,4.1558441558441555
3128746,5,B0014BQR7E,"Mitch Albom is a great author!  For One More Day was the first book that I read out of his top three best sellers.  I kind of went backwards in reading them as they came out.  After reading the book the first time, i knew i had to read it to my mother for the second time.  Both of us were so moved by such great stories Mr. Albom produces.  I had the opportunity to watch the movie when it aired on TV, my mother did not.  I just purchased the movie and we will watch it together soon.  I am so excited!",1212883200,,504,3.8349514563106797
3128747,5,B0014BQR7E,"This movie is a small gem.  Ellen Burstyn and Michael Imperioli have great rapport, believable as mother and son.  A drunk ex-ball player about to end his life gets one last day to spend with his mother, who is deceased.  The story blurs the line between life and death, and shows how we all hurt those we love, despite our best intentions.  This story demonstrates how children must all one day accept their parents, and themselves, as flawed human beings, just trying to do the best they can with the tools they were given.  The book was wonderful, and the movie is just as good.  Watch it with a warm cup of cocoa, a bowl of hot buttery popcorn, and your favorite blanket and definitely a whole box of kleenex.  Better yet, watch it with your Mom.",1212278400,9,750,4.430656934306569
3128748,4,B0014BQR7E,"Scenes of a man's life play out in many flashbacks, capturing crucial moments that help explain why he is the way he is today. You're probably well aware that this movie involves a mother-son relationship, but it also just as importantly covers father-son and father-daughter.

If you are an adult, it has the potential to break your heart, and/or inspire you to treat the people in your life better, including treating yourself better. Or it might just make you feel uncomfortable.

Because of the modern day daughter in the movie, teenage girls will probably relate the most to this movie, as it gives them a peek into figuring out why their dad acts the way he does. The movie is a bit slow and seems to be geared more towards women. I think they hired the actor from the Sopranos to try to attract more men viewers.

A movie like this is designed to make you stop and think about your own life (with a little supernatural gimmick thrown in for creativity). It's not as effective as say, ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but what is? Being an adult man, I personally enjoyed the similarly-themed movie ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage more than this movie. But the themes are always worth repeating, and getting slightly different takes on.

If you can handle that it's a bit boring, slow, and predictable (in my opinion), I still recommend it. As far as film adaptations of Mitch Albom's books go, I would list ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" the best (by far), ""For One More Day"" second best, and ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" third place.

Maybe Mitch Albom should try and find some more inspiring non-fiction stories to write. Until then, we are treated to these slightly manipulative, although thankfully non-trashy, works of fiction.",1210896000,6,1734,4.728476821192053
3128749,5,B0014BQR7E,"Well before THE SOPRANOS came on the scene in 1999
and made a serious impact on pop culture and television,
Michael Imperioli, who skillfully played the complex and
sociopathic nephew of Tony Soprano, Christopher Moltasanti,
had established himself as a very good character & supporting actor
who could hold his own against many well-known actors and actresses.
He's also turned in some good performances where he was the
featured actor which didn't get as much notoriety as his work
with The Sopranos.
Soon after that unforgettable series ended in 2007,
he teamed with Oprah Winfrey to do this television movie
""For One More Day"", where he does an excellent job and shows
that he is so much more than a common mafia crew member.
He brings such a depth and passion to his character and
veteran actress Ellen Burstyn shines in this too!
How many of us have said to ourselves
""If we could only have one more day with a loved one
who has made the transition, to make it right,
to get closure, to tell them how much we loved them!""
I don't want to give the story away, but this is a good movie
that kind of went under the radar when it came out.
Imperioli's young son, Vadim, makes his acting debut as his
character as a child.
A good addition to your DVD collection.",1208304000,20,1263,4.5196506550218345

What can I say...the camera loves his face & I'm quite partial to short Italian men who are also extremely gifted actors.  They needn't all even be as pretty as a young Al P.  I'm nothing if not flexible when it comes to... (back to the film review)  This is simply a really good well-worth-watching flick.  Of course, It's hard to fault anything w/Ellen B. in it.  She does the best ""no-nonsense-approach-to-ignoring-rude-male-children-w/dry-humor"" mom I've ever seen.  She's as good at it, may better, in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"".  (by completely ignoring that O.W. is in any way connected makes still enjoying this movie possible)

p.s.  Michael's son, Vadim, is the spitting image of his dad...nose & all.  The kid could have a real future in the theater were he so inclined...",1419033600,,944,4.942675159235669

Scripting, scenes, everything fit smoothly into a sometimes complicated jump from past-to-present-to-past again.  Great depth in the book, though not always easy to follow, making the film adaptation in this respect easier to enjoy than the book at times -- if you've read the book, the film makes the story-via-film very easy to follow!  Excellent, well done, with perfect acting/casting, rendering the characters, their personalities, every expression and attitude absolutely 'real' via these great acting talents!",1409097600,,599,5.622222222222222

It has always been hard watching the movie of a book I just read, due to my mind creating the characters and details on how everyone looks and details of story.

The ethereal and heavenly experiences I had while enjoying the writer's skill was not present in the film. Perhaps it was the editing or the producing which stripped the story of all its power.

3363290,5,B0014BQR7E,"Currently on a all consuming quest to ""own every Michael Imperioli film in existence"".  Came to be after my ""The Sopranos"" the complete series marathon.  What can I say...the camera loves his face & I'm quite partial to short Italian men who are also extremely gifted actors.  They needn't all even be as pretty as a young Al P.  I'm nothing if not flexible when it comes to... (back to the film review)  This is simply a really good well-worth-watching flick.  Of course, It's hard to fault anything w/Ellen B. in it.  She does the best ""no-nonsense-approach-to-ignoring-rude-male-children-w/dry-humor"" mom I've ever seen.  She's as good at it, may better, in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"".  (by completely ignoring that O.W. is in any way connected makes still enjoying this movie possible)

p.s.  Michael's son, Vadim, is the spitting image of his dad...nose & all.  The kid could have a real future in the theater were he so inclined...",1419033600,,944,4.942675159235669

3363293,5,B0014BQR7E,"Excellent, well written for film.  Already own, read, and loved the book yrs ago.  Scripting, scenes, everything fit smoothly into a sometimes complicated jump from past-to-present-to-past again.  Great depth in the book, though not always easy to follow, making the film adaptation in this respect easier to enjoy than the book at times -- if you've read the book, the film makes the story-via-film very easy to follow!  Excellent, well done, with perfect acting/casting, rendering the characters, their personalities, every expression and attitude absolutely 'real' via these great acting talents!",1409097600,,599,5.622222222222222

3363299,4,B0014BQR7E,"The movie is good, and acting is good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was not the same as the book.  If I had not read the book first, I would probably be confused about some of the things in the movie.  Some things are not explained, but because I read the book first, I understood what was going on.",1384300800,2,326,3.909090909090909

3363302,5,B0014BQR7E,"The book is one that I couldn't put down and read it in 4-5 hours.  I watched a clip on youtube and wasn't too impressed, but I took a chance and picked it up.  It has always been hard watching the movie of a book I just read, due to my mind creating the characters and details on how everyone looks and details of story.  Well.....like I said, I'm glad I bought this one.  Great Story and the movie did a good job portraying it. Much better than what I thought it would be.  If you liked the book, you will like the movie.",1367193600,,523,3.9903846153846154

3363322,5,B0014BQR7E,Although teetering on the edge of being a saccharine tearjerker this film manages to convey a really deep feeling of 'Oh why didn't I say that when she was alive.' It was a cathartic experience for me even though my Mum died 30 years ago. Very well handled.,1351987200,,257,4.375
3363323,2,B0014BQR7E,"I really enjoyed the book by Mitch Alborn but the movie was a great disappointment.  The ethereal and heavenly experiences I had while enjoying the writer's skill was not present in the film. Perhaps it was the editing or the producing which stripped the story of all its power.  Which ever, my advice is to not waste your money or time on this trite, shallow, drained attempt at capturing the wonder of a life renewed and saved. Enjoy the book.",1328313600,,445,4.55
