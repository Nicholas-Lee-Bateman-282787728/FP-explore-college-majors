994067,5,6305186642,"This is one of my favorite films, so I excitedly added this Criterion Collection version to my shopping cart without even paying much attention to the complete item description.  Imagine my happy surprise when it arrived and I discovered the second disk with all the special, additional features.

It greatly enhances the experience of enjoying THIS SPORTING LIFE which is already so rich with its brave, sensitive and thoughtful direction & performances.  I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.",1143676800,,498,4.975903614457831
994068,4,6305186642,"I went into this film totally ignorant of its content and place in history.  Why it is considered great became obvious quite quickly.  That said, it was extremely dark and depressing, and seemed quite long--the only reason for my not giving it the full five stars.  Harris is incredible and I can't believe he wasn't give more roles along the lines of those that Burton and O'Toole had. And at times he's somewhat like them, only with this particular character he takes longer to explode.  His performance is smoldering and when he lets go he blows everyone away.  Now, aside from the superb acting, the cinematography is excellent and some of the shots and ""ideas"" are as fresh today as they must have been in 1963.  Actually, I'm quite amazed that more people haven't held this film up as an example of something that truly broke new ground when it was made.  Would I watch this again?  No, but that doesn't mean it was not a perfect film, but rather that it is quite the emotional roller-coaster of a ride that you'd expect from a near perfect movie and I frankly just don't want to put myself through that again.",1141948800,3,1116,4.545
994069,5,6305186642,"This drama offers a gripping story and outstanding performances. The affair between a frigid widow and a professional rugby player who carries the violence of the football field into his personal life is painfully detailed and will have you captivated throughout the whole film.
A powerful film characteristic of the British dramas of the 50s and 60s based on working class life in rural England. Director Lindsay Anderson is one of the major contributors to this genre.",1076284800,5,470,5.116883116883117

This great sport, Rugby League, was born of the toughness and physicality that these hard men faced in their everyday lives.
Richard Harris is brilliant in the lead role of Frank Machin, and the Rugby League scenes are the most realistic portrayal of sport ever bought to the screen.

994071,5,6305186642,"While viewing this film again recently, I was curious to see if it has lost any of its edge since I first saw it almost 40 years ago. It hasn't. In fact, in light of almost daily revelations of inappropriate (if not illegal) conduct by professional and even by so-called amateur athletes, it has perhaps even more relevance today. In my opinion, Richard Harris (Frank Machin) delivers his finest performance as a coal miner in Northern England (Yorkshire) who gains fame and fortune as a professional rugby player. I am reminded of Scorcese and De Niro's presentation of Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. (Both athletes fail in their personal relationships for precisely the same reasons they succeed in competition.) Rachel Roberts plays Mrs. Hammond, the only person Machin sincerely cares about, other than himself. Most of the time, she endures his use and abuse of her but in one memorable scene, she confronts him as the arrogant bully he is. He appreciates her only after....
David Storey wrote the screenplay based on his novel (same title) and, under Lindsay Anderson's crisp and sure direction, each member of the cast delivers a superb performance, including Glenda Jackson in what I think is her debut role. The colorful, often violent action on various playing fields is effectively portrayed, in stunning contrast with the drab lives of those who cheer on the teams. Credit  Denys Coop for the cinematography. In essence, this film explores the nature and extent of one man's raw ambition and almost animalistic determination as his natural talents enable him to seize opportunities available to few others. Comparisons of This Sporting Life with Raging Bull are not a stretch. (Presumably De Niro saw this film prior to portraying La Motta. Did Harris see Brando in On the Waterfront before portraying Machin?) This is a dark film in terms of its tone and setting; also in terms of what it reveals about the values of young men such as Machin whose fame and fortune can be gone so quickly, and often unexpectedly. Then what? Within its own self-imposed limits, this is a ""classic"" film.",1065571200,14,2097,4.923728813559322
994072,4,6305186642,"The movies actually about a Rugby League player, not a Rugby player - had it been a Rugby player I definitely wouldn't have watched the movie. A very good film with lots of tough scenes.",1037664000,3,186,4.3428571428571425
994073,5,6305186642,"This masterpiece by Lindsay Anderson should be on any film aficionado's must-see list. It is an uncompromising study of alienation, social class, maturity, and loneliness. Richard Harris gives a performance of astonishing realism: it seems unlikely he could ever surpass it. The character moves  from physicalized anger to tenderness often within a moment. Harris builds  to a completely believable dramatic eruption by the climax. He is matched  all along the way by Rachel Roberts, a great actress in an unforgettable  role: a woman unwilling to let go of the past and the pain it  contains.
Anderson populates the film with several other memorable  characters--an older man who seems to be in love with the hero, the  grasping team-owner's wife who wishes to possess him.
The film contains  scenes of nearly unbearable intensity and anguish (Frank's drunken ballad  sung in a bar, or Margaret's pleading to be left alone). Also of note is  the film's unusual structure, functioning on two levels at once: in  ""real time"" and in Frank's memory, which he may be coloring by  his own reactions (something for the viewer to contemplate).
The black  and white cinematography is often beautiful as it poeticizes Frank's plight  (for example, near the end of the film, he ends up wandering along moonlit  railway tracks in a world of steely, silvery loneliness. Also of note, the  wonderfully nightmarish music by Roberto Gerhard, an avant-garde composer  who differed with the director on the scoring the film.
See the film on  DVD for maximum quality. Although the disc contains no special features, it  is good to know this great picture has been preserved in the new medium.",957225600,22,1674,5.065934065934066

Back in the summer of 1994, A&E channel played this movie on Sunday, over and over again. It took me many years to appreciate this film. It really exhibits life, in drab north of England.

994226,5,6305186642,"""This Sporting Life."" (1963). A true black and white British classic, a scorching sport-centered drama, helmed by prolific director Lindsay Anderson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Lucky-Man-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UJ48VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Lucky Man! (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>).  It's based on a novel by the respected David Storey,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier/dp/B000IHLG58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier</a>) who also did the screenplay.  In  Northern England in the early 1960s, the rough, sullen young Frank Machin, a coal miner, finds that he is mean, tough and ambitious enough to become an overnight star in the rugby league team run by local employer Weaver. Machin lodges with Mrs. Margaret Hammond, whose husband was killed in an accident at Weaver's, but his impulsive and angry nature stops him from being able to reach her as he would like: his efforts all prove self-defeating.  He becomes increasingly frustrated with his situation; this is not helped by the more straightforward enticements Mrs. Weaver offers.

It's a small tale that runs a longish 134 minutes, but never wastes a minute.  The film is always evocative; one of the most outstanding of the so-called ""kitchen sink"" realist dramas, films featuring working class characters and concerns that were typical of the period.

The picture brings us an outstanding cast.

SPORTING LIFE was director Anderson's first feature film following years of documentary work; its direction is focused as a flame, particularly the sports scenes.  The movie also gives us the atmosphere of the drab Bolton, Yorkshire at the time.  Life for most is harsh and bleak; downtrodden people live in the shadow of industry and corruption that often damages their health and crushes their hopes.  The film is always glum,and still angry after all these years, full of raging performances that paint a hard to forget picture.",1323216000,,3845,8.16267942583732

Almost all critics consider it a masterpiece, but on first viewing both the performances and the writing were too theatrical for me to grant it quite that level of perfection.

994230,5,6305186642,"Throughout the dozen or so film roles I had seen him in I was never particularly impressed with the film work of Richard Harris. Not that there was anything of particularly bad quality to it, but neither was there anything of particularly great quality either. Then I watched This Sporting Life, the 1963 black and white debut film of Lindsay Anderson, starring Harris as rugby star Frank Machin and....WOW! What a revelation. Yes, the comparisons to Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire and Robert De Niro's Jake La Motta in Raging Bull are apt. Save for one thing. Harris gives an even better performance than those two iconic actors in those two iconic roles. Why? Simple. His performance is realer. Really. Watch Brando again, and compare his scene where he famously rages Stella to that where Harris pleads his love to Margaret in this film. Harris never loses total control, plus he has a tenderness and vulnerability inside of the rage. Now, watch De Niro when a bloated La Motta is in jail and pumping his fists against concrete, and compare it to the scene where Harris punches a hospital wall, and crushes a spider hovering over Margaret during her death scene. Yes, in one film Harris outdoes signature performances held up as some of the greatest in film history.

The DVD is from The Criterion Collection, and it's among the better packages offered since the company started skimping on audio commentaries after they switched to the new semi-circle C logo a few years back. It contains two disks, and the first disk has a restored audio and video version of the film, and it is sparkling. Also on it are the original theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary with Paul Ryan, editor of Never Apologise: The Collected Writings Of Lindsay Anderson, and David Storey, the screenwriter and author of the novel, This Sporting Life. The two seem to have recorded their parts at separate times, and Ryan is by far the more interesting speaker. He is knowledgeable about the film, the place and time of the film's setting, and on general aspects of film, in general, and this one is particular. He also relates some entertaining and informative anecdotes about the film's director, Lindsay Anderson. One wishes the whole commentary could have been Ryan alone, for when Storey speaks, the commentary dies. Even though the story is a fictive version of many of the events of his own life, Storey lacks any real insights into his own private 'Machin moments,' nor does he seem to have anything interesting or articulate to say about the film or the novel. If Ryan's commentary is a 95 out of 100, then Storey's is a 40 or 45. Splitting the difference, one is left with a passable listening experience of a 70 or so. In short, more is often less. The second disk contains many good features: Lindsay Anderson: Lucky Man?, a half hour long BBC Scotland documentary with interviews with the director's friends and collaborators; an interview with Lois Sutcliffe Smith, Anderson's friend and a producer; Meet the Pioneers, Anderson s first documentary short, from 1948; Wakefield Express a 1952 short subject; Is That All There Is? Anderson's fictively autobiographical, final 50 minute long film, from 1993; as well as a booklet with essays by film scholar Neil Sinyard and Anderson's 1963 article on film, Stand Up! Stand Up! Neither writing wows the reader. But, overall, a bevy of quality features that could buoy the experience of the package even if the film, itself, were mediocre. Since it is a great film, it's a terrific overall package for cineastes.

This Sporting Life is not the most seamlessly made film, but like Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler (whose ambiguous ending it presages), it claws and scratches its way to great art, led by the two most basic tools of the medium: a great script and great acting. Rachel Roberts is almost the equal of Harris as the repressed widow Hammond. There are moments one thinks she is about to give in to Machin, but then she represses, and one gets the sense that her months of repression may have physically affected her, because she seems otherwise perfectly healthy, and women in their early to mid thirties do not just drop dead from brain hemorrhages without a great internal struggle. And this is all heightened by the fact that their relationship grows and changes over the course of the 135 minute long film. Unlike the recent Revolutionary Road, the viewer grows to understand these characters and their relationship over time, and are not just plunged into a maelstrom. This is because Anderson and Storey understood narrative, and that it is the basis of any good screenplay, which is the basis of a good film. Taking that to its logical next step, any great film (which This Sporting Life is) will likely have a great screenplay. And, despite its visual nature, film is far closer to literature (specifically poetry, at its best) than to photography. The mere movement of images means nothing without the development of story, from character, from acting, from a screenplay. Simple, yet not. Just like Frank Machin.",1283299200,3,5103,4.877880184331797
994231,5,6305186642,"It was in the early part of this decade, when I was in my late teens, that I first began my obsession with movies. It was in these formative years of film study that I first compiled my list of favorite actors, both of the leading and character variety. Though the list continues to grow to this day, there still isn't an actor I favor more than Richard Harris. I find it immensely fascinating how he could convincingly portray the supreme ruler of all Rome, Marcus Aurelius, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00009ZYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Gladiator""</a>&nbsp;and also so believably give such a nuanced perfomance of the poor, simple farmer Bull McCabe in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Field/dp/B00005V1WP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Field""</a>. Then there was the soulful portrayal of the brilliant yet haunted Abbe Faria in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Count-of-Monte-Cristo/dp/B00006ADFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Count of Monte Cristo""</a>, and the brief yet scene-stealing role of English Bob in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unforgiven/dp/0790729644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Unforgiven""</a>.

Yet, while I had loved each of these performances, they all fell somewhere within the twilight years of his career. I was more than curious to see the early work of Harris and felt that the 2008 Criterion Collection release of ""This Sporting Life"" would be a perfect place to start. Harris was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance here, the only time he was so honored until he received the nod for ""The Field"". It's a crime he never won either time, because there's no question that he deserved the trophy for each film.

""This Sporting Life"" is, in a word, a masterwork. Though I must mention Lindsay Anderson's adept direction, the lion's share of the credit must go to Harris, who portrays miner-turned-rugby-player Frank Machin. It's definitely in the top ten pantheon of film performances because Harris wholly inhabits this role. When he's passive or downtrodden, the depths of his troubles are etched on every line of his face. When he's upset or angry his intensity is electric! The DVD cover captures one of my favorite moments from the film, when Machin is observing himself in the mirror and thrusts a punch into the air. There's a raw masculinity to his demeanor, so much so that his destructive spirit is at once intoxicating and repulsive.

I find it difficult to write about the plot of the film, because when the film is over the broad details seem immaterial. The sole reason to watch this film is for Richard Harris, though it bears mention that all the supporting actors turn in strong performances (especially Rachel Roberts performance as Margaret Hammond). Concerning the plot, it's interesting to note that the film is complex enough that audiences are nearly always divided on who is the ""villain"" of the piece. Personally, I placed great sympathy with Machin, even though he plowed through his world with reckless fervor and often displayed little consideration for the feelings of others. In many ways he was, as Hammond so succinctly phrased it: ""just a great ape on the football field"".

I'm amazed this film isn't more iconic than it is, the themes presented resonate with me to this day - particularly as a young man. Machin embodied a more pure 'rebellious youth' than films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rebel-Without-a-Cause/dp/B0007US7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Rebel Without a Cause""</a>&nbsp;because he was dealing with reality head-on. There was no placement of blame on a broken marriage between his parents or that he moved somewhere that he didn't like. It wasn't because his puppy died or a kid at school bullied him. Machin had very real and very serious problems. It took nearly all he had to confront them, and often, he seemed to be unable to. The sheer weight of it all was too much too bear at times, he would shut himself off from the world and those around him. But, in the end, Machin was still a good man at heart. The picnic scene is beautifully shot and clearly portrays that Machin's humanity is very much intact, particularly in his energetic and playful interactions with the children.

It could be argued that Machin was driven to his destructive tendencies as a manner of coping with the fact that Hammond simply could not return his deep affection for her. By the same token, it could be said that Machin drove the poor widow mad with his overbearing presence and lack of emotional intuition. It's these dense layers within the film that make is so compelling to watch, even though it's utterly depressing to watch two people burn out so quickly and violently. It feels starkly realistic because 'till the bitter end there is little hope of something better.

The Paul Newman film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hud/dp/B0000AUHQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Hud""</a>&nbsp;was once my favorite character study, but these days it takes a distant second to ""This Sporting Life"". I've seen the film three times so far, and each time I don't feel melancholy afterward, but rather a sense of relief at the notion that - perhaps - things are better for both of them in the end. Maybe, just maybe, the end result isn't so bad after all. I suppose it's a testament to the impact of the film that I'm so completely swept away with it that I delude myself with fantasies of a happier conclusion.",1245974400,5,5681,5.561849710982659

994294,4,6305186642,"The film also went from a tight, action-drama in the first half hour to a straight drama the second half hour to a melodrama over the last hour. It had a tightness in the beginning, an edgy feel to it, whether it was ""Frank"" on the playing field or trying to make headway with ""Margaret"" and her two small kids. Then, it slowly got almost into a soap opera mindset but still kept my interest if only to find out what wound happen to this ""couple.""

Kudos to Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts (""Margaret"") for keeping it interesting because it's a fairly long film and there is a long segment where very little happens.

Both Richrd Harris and Rachel Roberts were up for Academy Awards. I thought Harris was the standout here. It's hard to be a loutish rugby jock on one hand and a tender, caring guy at the same time, but Harris pulled it off. He made ""Machin"" a very believable character with that tough-soft combination. He even looked the part: a rough guy who could (and did in real life) muck it up with the best of 'em in a very physical sport. Harris was so good that one minute you really rooted for him; the next minute you'd think ""the hell with this moron.""

Roberts evoked similar emotions. You wanted this bitter and angry woman to be happy, yet sometimes you thought she didn't deserve someone who seemed to care. As a man, I felt Frank's frustration in trying to get to this lady, who might have a lot to offer (besides sex) if she'd just let go of the past and her anger. She's also upset about being a ""kept woman,"" something this generation doesn't understand. In Margaret's day, you didn't stay in the same house with a man unless you were married. The neighbors were talking, and she was shamed.

 Roberts, I am told, had many demons in her (real) life and didn't have the career of her co-star, but she was a fine, fine actress.

Both these man characters were simple and complex, at the same time. This is why I looked at this film as a character study of two people, instead of a depressing melodrama, which some have labeled it. Yeah, it's not ""Mary Poppins"" but I didn't find it that depressing. I also enjoyed William Hartnell as ""Dad"" Johnson. I wish his role had been bigger. He was a very intriguing guy. The rugby team's owners were portrayed - as many were back then - as nothing but exploitive.

Another big part of the reason I basically enjoyed the film was the excellent direction and photography, and the fantastic DVD transfer given to us by Criterion. This is a pristine print: no spots, now flaws - just a fabulous picture. If you enjoy the cinematography of film noir, you'll like this. If you appreciate powerful human dramas, you'll find it worth your while.",1244160000,3,2700,4.464503042596349
994295,5,6305186642,"I've seen this film roughly seven times and each time I grow to love it even more.  It's sublimely acted, ferociously directed and brilliantly constructed.  The script is poignant and focused; the mood and atmosphere is masterfully conflicted (yes, I said and mean conflicted; it's a brilliant take on conflicting emotions) and the overall feel this film delivers is one of pure satisfaction, even if the film is heartbreakingly bleak and somber.

The film tells the story of Frank Machin, a young gruff man who allows Rugby fame to go to his head and destroy his hopes for a happy life.  Renting a room from a young widow named Margaret, Frank finds himself wanting to be a center part of her family (she has young children) but is constantly finding himself on the outskirts due to his demeanor.  He is segregated from the team despite his athletic ability and ferocious drive.  He has one loyal friend in Maurice, a fellow teammate, but his own selfishness causes him to almost reject Maurice's friendship.

Frank is a mess of man who hasn't a chance.

The film works as two films; an exciting and engrossing sports story as well as a thought provoking character study.  The story is told through flashbacks that tell us a little at a time the type of man Frank is and the effect he has on the people around him.  His relationship with Margaret seems to be the central theme running throughout the film, and the final explosive confrontation between the two is the most profound scene in the film, tying up all out thoughts of this man and our reservations about his future.

This is one of those rare films that fully explains it's character, for when the credit begin to roll you feel as if you truly know this man.  Director Lindsay Anderson brilliantly weaves this tale together with such fluidity that we are drawn in by every frame.  He presents such a solid case for us, reflecting on Machin's social standing as well as his dire loneliness to flesh out this man; and in the process he taps into the alienation and resentment that festers under the skin of those around him, namely Margaret.

I am a firm believer in the fact that Richard Harris should have won the Oscar for his riveting portrayal of Frank Machin.  Yes, I know, I've mentioned this before in my review of `Lilies of the Field', but it bears repeating.  Harris is leagues ahead of the performance that actually won that year, so far ahead in fact that it is an insult to have lost; truly.  He captures the inner struggle of this man with delicate precision on dire determination.  You cannot take your eyes off this man as he constructs this man from the ground up and delivers a blisteringly real performance.  He is aided by Rachel Roberts, who was also outstanding, as well as Alan Badel, William Hartnell and the Oscar snubbed Colin Blakely who brilliantly counteracts Harris's harshness with a solid and joyful supporting performance.

994298,5,6305186642,"Richard Harris: Early Roles

Though Richard Harris starred in a couple of classic films in the 1990's (The Field, Unforgiven) his career has been highly inconsistent and many of his 70's and 80's roles were just plain forgettable. He is, nonetheless, an actor with undeniable appeal and an actor who is revered by other actors if not by the general public. I think this is mainly due to his early work. The two films that I associate Harris with are Lindsay Anderson's This Sporting Life (1963) & Michelangelo Antonioni's Red Desert (1965). Both of these films are must-sees for cinema fans. The Anderson film is perfectly suited to Harris' raw talent and temperamant as Harris was himself a pro Rugby player. Personally, however, I prefer the Antonioni film which casts a much matured & much mellowed Richard Harris who has refined his talent & temperament and his acting style. Nonetheless, the Anderson film is every bit as good as many critics say it is even though its hard not to think of the more appealing Brando film On the Waterfront while watching it. In This Sporting Life, Harris essentially plays the animal side of himself (with a dose of Brando thrown in for good measure); in Red Desert Harris is forced to draw upon the more refined side of his character and the performance is fascinating; in Red Desert Harris' character is, in turns, hot with interest & emotion and cold with indifference.

Richard Harris & Marlon Brando as Working Class Heroes

Like Brando, Harris posseses an abundance of both proud masculine prowess & sleek feminine grace; and both actors find compelling ways to use their natural qualities. Some criticize Harris for copying Brando's acting style and I think that is a fair criticism as there are a handful of scenes that are very much Brando impersonations, but I also think that the Harris performance and the film overall cannot be dismissed as merely a British take on method acting or a British re-make of On the Waterfront. While both films are about working class athletes, they are each about very different kinds of characters in very different kinds of social systems and each character has very different kinds of hurdles to overcome. On the Waterfront has a lot going for it because Brando plays a much more likable character than does Richard Harris and this is partly because the Brando character really has no awareness of just how corrupt the game and humanity are until it is too late. The oft quoted revelation scene in On the Waterfront is justly famous.  But the Harris character in This Sporting Life never really shows any vulnerability because he is never fooled by his handlers. He is smart enough to know what he's getting into when he signs up with the City League; he knows who he works for; how much he gets paid; and what the game is all about. There is no real moment of innocence lost because there never was any innocence to begin with. Harris is excellent (almost as excellent as Brando), but because the character he plays is intelligent he is also less sympathetic than the Brando character who is not. We tend to view Brando as the innocent victim of a corrupt community/sport/nation/humanity while we see Harris less as a victim than as a willing accomplice in his own downfall/destruction. We also tend to think that had Harris's character simply read less sensationalistic literature, or been more of a team player on the Rugby field and off, he would have been more likely to mature in more refined ways and actually develop emotional attachments. This might be a comment about class but its also a way of making it more difficult to read the character simply as a victim of class exploitation.

American and British Social Reality

Finally, what unites these two films is their social content. In the British film This Sporting Life, Harris' character never really thinks social mobility or self-transformation is really a possibility and this is one reason he clings to the very symbol of working class squalor: the single mother with two kids. Whereas in the American film On the Waterfront social mobility and self-transformation is a dream that rarely leaves the Brando character's mind. This is perhaps the key difference between the British and the American visions of class in life and in film. The British are uncomfortable with social mobility and tend to feel more comfortable when class distinctions are clearly demarcated; while the Americans, at least in theory and in art, tend to view people not according to class but according to their aspirations and accomplishments. In the end,both films suggest that class is a social determinant, but neither film really suggests that class is the sole determinant.

One further note: The producer of This Sporting Life was Karel Reisz who later directed a very interesting film that also deals with class & education & identity & self-destruction called The Gambler starring James Caan.",1201910400,8,4927,4.886363636363637
994299,5,6305186642,"This isn't just a great British film this is a great film, period.  It would be easy to dismiss this film in the ilk of the angry young man-kitchen sink adaptions of John Osborne or Alan Sillitoe works and you would be sadly mistaken.  Granted, the milieu is the rugby fields of working class Yorkshire and star Richard Harris seems to have his fists and jaw perpetually clenched.  This is at it's heart a love story between coalminer turned rugby star Frank Machin (Harris) and his withdrawn landlady, Margaret Hammond(Rachel Roberts), albeit a tragically unrequited one.  Based on a book by David Storey, the film has an interesting structure.  The film begins on the day of a Christmas Eve match where Frank has some teeth dislodged by an opposing player.  Sitting in a dentist chair under anasthesia Frank's mind wanders to the past.  He ponders his gridiron glory but mostly his rejected overtures to Margaret.  Not to say that Frank is the smoothest operator.  His first advance to Margaret is practically rape.  He takes her out on a date to a swanky restaurant and acts like a complete boor.  Margaret isn't completely blameless here, either.  Mourning the death of her late husband, she religiously shines his workboots nightly.  She allows Frank a few intimacies but gives little of herself to him.  When Frank professes his love her response is to spit in his face.  It would appear that Margaret after the heartbreaking loss of her husband is afraid to freely give of herself.  Frank, in a pensive moment, confides to a friend that he is afraid that he'll never be able to love.  Needless to say both Harris and Roberts are superlative and were nominated for Oscars for their work here.  Harris lost to Sidney Poitier for ""Lillies of the Field"" but the underappreciated Roberts inexplicably lost to Patricia Neal for ""Hud"".  Neal's work was good but to my mind it was essentially a supporting role.  Debuting feature director Lindsay Anderson's work is nothing less than spectacular.  Aside from evoking the grimy working class environment he masterfully orchestrates the complexities of the film's central relationship.  ""This Sporting Life"" is an indispensible work for the ages.",1201392000,2,2193,4.950684931506849

994301,4,6305186642,"One of the greatest sports films ever made Lindsay Anderson's This Sporting Life is a film that while not always easy to watch demands to be seen. Richard Harris, in a Cannes best actor winning role, plays Frank Machin, a ex coal miner who becomes a rugy star in his north London community. Machin is a broodish brute of a man trying to escape his social situation in the only way he knows how by playing violent City League rugby. His success on the field is mirrored by his loneliness and detachment off the field as he attempts to gain the love of his emotionally dead widow landlady Margaret Hammond (Rachel Roberts).

This film forms the template for many of the great sports films that followed it. It was especially important to Martin Scorsese in his film Raging Bull. Harris'performance is incredible. It is almost as if he were channeling Brando's performance in On the Waterfront. The film's structure is also unique. Machin's story is told in a series of flashbacks on the day that he got his teeth knocked out on the rugby field.

This film offers an emotional rollercoaster ride like no other that I've seen recently. Shot in harsh white light by Denys Coop. The color palette matches the loneliness and social stratification felt by the main characters. This is not an easy film to watch but it does have its rewards. This is part of the origins of the so-called angry young man cinema of the 1960's. It was this type of film that introduced the world to Britain's working class.

I viewed this film in the Paramount VHS edition which provided an adequate viewing experience. The film is available in a rare DVD edition. The costly nature makes purchase of the DVD impossible for me but it is my understanding that there are no special features.

Do yourself a favor and seek it out. View it as a great sports film or social commentary but see it.",1185062400,7,1862,4.599397590361446
994302,5,6305186642,"Frank Machin's life is empty. Devoid of social graces his one escape from a boring existance is the atheletic skills he displays during Rugby League games. Violence and brute force are the norm and he excells at this sport. His life off the field is drab, boring and at times violent. The film's gray black and white coloring mimic the drab existence of the working class he emanates from. He lodges with a widow who is frigid and withdrawn from the world and lives alone with two children. We  only know of her husband's suicide but can easily guess at the cause. Frank comes to love this woman but is unable to inspire the same feelings from her. We are at times touched by his tender advances towards her and the paternal interests in her children. Unfortunately neither of these two people is able to get past the deep isolation which characterizes their lives.

  Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts are both superb and this movie should be on every must see list. I can't recollect any better performance from Harris",1168214400,2,1020,4.65
994303,5,6305186642,"From the opening scene, one gets the feeling that this is a unique movie.  Little in ""This Sporting Life"" is obvious and there is much subtlety that I'm sure I missed the first time around.  However, the composite of this movie clearly portrays an angry young man with an obsession that even he can't seem to truly define.  He is out to conquer the world and full of the self-confidence to do so.  However, the world is abrasive and it wears him down bit by bit.  He will not surrender but he realizes that he cannot control the world around him.

""This Sporting Life"" jumps around in time to give us a complete story in an economic way.  It seems odd to note that this 134 minute movie comes across as too short.  The closing scene is so brilliant that we understand completely what has become of our anti-hero.  There are many other telling scenes as well.  One in particular takes place when he takes his lady to a posh restaurant.  His boorish behavior is almost too overdone but the point is made; this man is from the working class.  He may take their money but he does not belong in their world.  At least not without an invitation.  What was most difficult for me to grasp was Harris's relationship with his landlady/lover.  Their ""affair"" seems to be one-sided on his part.  She is living in grief from the loss of her first husband and seems to be always pulling away from his advances.  In the end, she seems to be the one person he needs yet the one person he cannot influence.  Along the way, Harris shows himself beholden to no one.  The one friend he appears to have on the team learns that even he cannot tease this troubled man.

Lindsay Anderson and Richard Harris both achieved greatness in ""This Sporting Life"".  I paused halfway through the movie to reflect that I have never seen Richard Harris so good in any other role.  He owns this film in a way that even the writer cannot claim credit for.  Anderson uses his gifts as a director to get the most out of every scene.  There are no meaningless moments in ""This Sporting Life"".  This is not a feel good movie.  The film wears you down with its's bleak outlook.

Harris even reprises a variation on Brando's famous cry of ""Stella!"" Is it possible that so few British critics had seen the Brando films at the time that they thought Harris was doing something novel? In any event, (Brando-impressions aside) this is a very unpleasant film to watch. Great dramas like LONG DAY'S JOURNEY and DEATH OF A SALESMAN may require our serious attention, but we realize that we're watching something worth attending to and that we will remember. All this film offers us is the opportunity to spend two hours with a brutish Neanderthal with whom I would not want to spend 5 minutes in real life. The only positive element in this film is a remarkable, restrained performance by Rachel Roberts. But even her final scene is marred by one of the most intrusive, stupid Expressionistic images I've ever seen. As a young gay man, I loved IF... when it first came out. I enjoyed its sheer audacity. But after seeing more of Anderson's work, I can't help but think he was a very limited talent who had an enormous amount of solid support from his friends in the industry and the great good luck to create IF.. at precisely the moment he did.

7885661,5,6305186642,"Another of the great British New Wave films of the early sixties, often called kitchen sink films for their honest portrayal of working class people in their daily lives, a group that had been largely left out of British cinema previously. This one features Richard Harris in one of his best roles as Frank Machin, a factory worker in West Yorkshire who seeks a way out of his dead end existence with his talent in playing rugby. Rugby is a rough sport and Frank is a rough guy. As he says, ""It's Rugby. Soccer has stars"". The owner of the factory, Mr. Weaver, sponsors the local team and after cajoling a tryout Frank makes the team with a handsome signing bonus.

Frank's ambitions also include Mrs. Hammond, a widow in whose house he rents a room. He husband was killed in an industrial accident at Weaver's factory and she has been left with a young daughter. She is bitter about her husband's death and has almost given up on life. Frank's attentions are not at all welcome to her and one senses that part of his motivation in taking on rugby is to win her over by offering a better life. Frank, however has many problems of his own making, largely due to his hot temper and impulsive nature. When things seem to be going right,  he will always do something to mess it up. It's not that he has some suicidal wish but his fiery nature mixed with an inability to understand his situation and self constantly get him into trouble, such as the scene when he takes Mrs. hammond out to a fancy dinner and finds himself totally out of his element.

The story is told in flashbacks, gradually returning to the present. The black and white photography works well with the gritty realism of the time and place but is also very effective in an idyllic trip to the country with Frank, Mrs. Hammond and her daughter.  Harris is excellent, showing tenderness as well as temper (we all know how he could do temper). Rachel Roberts is fine in the difficult role of Mrs. Hammond, a woman who is not altogether sympathetic. Lindsay Anderson's direction is very good, though many think the film a bit long at over two hours. The film could have used some editing and still made its point, but this is a small quibble compared to the power of the piece.

Most of these kitchen sink films were about society and the British class system as much as they ever were about their characters, and this one differs in that it's a character study of Frank and finds problems more within him than in the society at large. He's an angry young man but the anger is simply within his nature and directed not at society but at whoever is at hand. This is somewhat of a difficult film in the sense that the characters are not very sympathetic and Frank is certainly no hero, but it is worthwhile nonetheless.",1457222400,3,2778,4.4714003944773175
