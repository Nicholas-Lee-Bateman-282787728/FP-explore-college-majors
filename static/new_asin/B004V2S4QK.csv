4481400,5,B004V2S4QK,"I am not an studied comedian nor am I a practitioner of the written word. I rarely submit ratings for anything, let alone typed reviews, but I have to make an effort to communicate my appreciation of Norm MacDonald and his blatant, explicit, subtle, subversive approach to comedy. Norm's camber, tone, very specific choice of words, stance, eye movement... his everything, is an display of raw comedic talent that cannot be learned. It can be refined and fostered, but the ability is innate. I know what I am typing is gratuitous, but I find Norm MacDonald to be one of the funniest people to ever have tried to be a funny people. If you know Norm MacDonald, watch this, if yo do not, please watch this and remove yourself from preconceptions and enjoy the art of thoughtful comedy.",1480550400,2,782,4.673913043478261

Norm's partially truth/mostly fiction memoir is essential for fans, and a great introduction to Norm's humor. From his long friendship with Rodney Dangerfield which was only marred by his sadness over Dangerfield's failure to ever get respect, to his audition for Lorne Michaels for SNL, to growing up a hick in rural Canada, this book is one great story after another.

4481413,5,B004V2S4QK,"Norm Macdonald is an authentic example of a nearly extinct form of comedian. He is a genuine subversive. We see some popular comics such as Louie CK, Patton Oswalt, Lewis Black, etc described as ""controversial"" or ""edgy"". Is this actually true? How much controversy do these comics truly generate if their audiences, friends, fellow comics, and people in the media generally agree with them? Has Lewis Black ever made his audience truly angry? How many times has Louie CK caused true discomfort in his friends due to his viewpoint on a hot button issue? When everyone within the social circles you inhabit cheers wildly as you denigrate and mock the groups and opinions all of you hate then words like ""conventional"" and ""safe"" are more accurate.

Norm Macdonald has spent his career making people squirm. His relentless attacks on OJ Simpson and Michael Jackson during his days on SNL led directly to him being fired. He was warned over and over but didn't care.

In this video he eviscerates the entire concept of Gay Pride. Ask yourself which of the other supposed ""edgy"" comics would touch this subject with a 10 foot pole.

4481447,5,B004V2S4QK,"I must admit, despite being a Norm fanatic since I first saw him on SNL back in '96, I haven't kept up with his career much of late. I'd seen him on Dave and Conan, and loved his bit on the Bob Saget Roast. Thank goodness I got myself into gear and watched his recent ""Me doing standup"". He had me laughing uproariously on the very first bit (about the many negatives to dying). By the time I was 15 minutes in, I was on the floor with tears in my eyes. It's around that point that Norm wonders why serial killers always bury victims in 'shallow graves'; he assures us he would be much more thorough, although 'I would never, ever murder a woman in cold blood'.
  Yes, it's obvious, Norm MacDonald hasn't changed a bit. Still utterly fearless (gags about serial killing?) and as always, seemingly unconcerned with a joke bombing or making his audience uncomfortable. And not because he has important messages to get across in his comedy, like Bill Hicks or George Carlin. No, simply because the material (and his legendary delivery) is at least as funny as any modern comedian (surpassed possibly by only Louis CK). Norm doesn't care if you think he's odd because he's unabashedly homophobic in these forgiving, inclusive climes, or because he thinks sex is 'dirty and filthy and obviously intended only for procreation'. That's because he knows you'll be laughing too hard to care.",1405296000,,1382,4.659836065573771
4481448,5,B004V2S4QK,"MacDonald is a funny guy.  Clever, not slapstick, reminds me a little of Tom Lehrer who used lines like: ""It's a sobering thought that when Mozart was my age, he'd been dead for ten years.""",1397779200,,189,4.4
4481449,4,B004V2S4QK,Gotta love Norm McDonald. His delivery of his jokes and stories are priceless. His material is always interestingly funny and sometimes downright hilarious.,1397433600,,156,5.826086956521739

4481451,3,B004V2S4QK,"I happen to really enjoy Norm Macdonald as a standup.  This material seemed to lack any luster.  I smiled some times, but no outright laughs.  At some points I was embarrassed for Norm because what he was saying didn't make sense, nor was it funny.  I 'liked' it, but was disappointed that he just isn't as funny as he used to be...just in my opinion.",1394582400,,351,4.3538461538461535
4481452,5,B004V2S4QK,"Ever since his days at SNL doing the Weekend Update- I've loved Norm's brand of humor. I originally saw an edited and censored version of this video a while back on Comedy Central  when I happened upon it at 1 or 2 am one night.  Five minutes into it I had woken up two roommates with my uncontrollable cackling...  they came out to see what the hell the racket was all about and a couple minutes later all three of us were doubled over.  Keep in mind, all three of us were already fans of Norm's comedy- I say that because it's not everybody's cup of tea.  Norm seems to be one of those comics where people either think he's quite possibly the funniest guy on earth- or he's not funny at all.  But if you're thinking about buying this video, you're probably not of the latter variety. If you like Norm- you'll love this set.  I've watched it so many times I can pretty much recite the entire deal and I think I'll watch it again right now!",1390176000,,940,4.217877094972067

He's older, more experienced and man, he just took it to a whole new level on this special. I haven't laughed this hard at a stand up routine in a long long time. This ranks up there with the greats like George Carlin and Bill Hicks, but Norm's style is totally original and unique.

He manages to take completely sad and pretty horrible subjects such as his father dying and somehow makes them funny. At the same time, though the subject matter is VERY touchy, he doesn't come off as tasteless or crude. To walk a line this sharp without crossing it what truly makes great comics.

I got this DVD the other day because, though I hadn't seen much of his stand-up, I always thought Norm was pretty amusing.

Wow.  I watched it five times in three days, and laughed heartily every time. It's a little slow to get going, but there are some real gems, and he hits some touchy subjects with a kind of goofy brilliance.  It's the funniest stand-up special I've seen in awhile.

4481473,4,B004V2S4QK,"Norm MacDonald: Me Doing Standup takes us to the edge of jocularity with his comedic approach to standup comedy. Infamously known for his long, drawn out punchlines, and sarcastic, nonchalant wit, Norm delivers the laughs in this short, sixty minute, standup comedy routine.

Ranging in topics from death, which will leave you gasping for breath as he approaches a delicate subject with mirth, to homosexuality, which was a little more difficult for him to pull off; it will leave you laughing until your sides ache! Other topics include alcoholism, family, the media, Tiger Woods, O.J. Simpson, and more!

With a fair deal of profanity, the jokes are delivered in only a way that Norm MacDonald can pull off. Without being overly vulgar, he broaches some fairly risky topics without bearing malice from the audience. The faces shared of the crowd scenes shows them enjoying themselves and the event they are a part of, sometimes including the audience into his routine, the energy being fed to Norm is exactly the kind a comedian requires to enable a spectacular performance.

Each segment of his act takes you on a roller coaster ride of laughs, riding each as you crest to the top and coast to the bottom to be uplifted time and again. If you are a Norm MacDonald fan, you will not be disappointed and, even if you aren't, this DVD has the merit to deliver.

On the minor side of things, Norm is showing his age in this latest performance. His physique has changed considerably, his cheeks and nose reddened, his onstage presence slow to pick up; however, the punchlines are delivered with gusto and finesse.

Included in this one-disk DVD you will be pleased to find bonus features which include Norm's pilot episode of Back To Norm, in which Rob Schneider guest hosted, also included is the roast of Bob Saget, which I found to be a bit wooden and cliched and the hilarious, animated short, ""The Twelves Days of Christmas"".",1310515200,3,1928,4.795180722891566

If you've ever been to a Norm standup, you know he likes to carry a joke for a looooooong time before the punchline. This is an accurate representation of his material. My only fear is that now when I see him, there will be jerks in the crowd yelling out material before he has a chance to deliver.",1310428800,2,564,4.136363636363637
4481475,4,B004V2S4QK,"so this is norm macdonald's first stand-up special. his style is observational, and there's a good amount of profanity in there. some of the jokes are pretty strong, and his topics are original for the medium (i've never heard a comedian speak so frankly about death, but norm still made it feel lighthearted). but the fact is, i wouldn't call this a classic. still good, but i was hoping for better i guess. the special feature ""back to norm"" pilot episode was pretty lame too.",1308441600,,478,4.635294117647059

8442798,1,B004V2S4QK,"Amazon listed this as PG so I thought this would be OK to watch with my 12 and 14 yr old kids but he used the ""F"" bomb every other sentence and he has a couple sex references.  His last bit (maybe 10 minutes) is completely about sex- I fast forwarded over and over but it went until the end.  Even if I had watched it without my kids I would have given it a single star.  It just wasn't funny.  I kind of felt sorry for him.",1510185600,,424,3.784090909090909

8442800,5,B004V2S4QK,"I called Amazon and returned the video because it was cut; there were three or four places where a very awkward cut was made. I love Norm's comedy and I think this is one of the most brilliant standup routines I've ever seen, but I couldn't stand the cuts they made in it.",1495497600,,272,4.150943396226415
