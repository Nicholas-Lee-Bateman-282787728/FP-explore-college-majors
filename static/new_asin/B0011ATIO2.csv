8272948,4,B0011ATIO2,"At the time a TV Director with Studio One, Brynner chose on this occassion to act.
Long before his seminal roles in the ""King and I"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" which mapped out the type of role and mannerisms which would follow, it is delightful to see him act against future type as a mild mannered (though disturbed) elderly gentleman.
His first feature film made at the same time was ""Port of New York"" in which he again surprises with his performance as a reptillian, sadistic murderer.
Brynner was actor of great range and ability which unfortunately he was unable to utilise as fully as he wished.
Sadly missed.
Synergy Archive should be congratulated for enabling us to view this forgotten gem.",1329091200,3,701,4.754098360655738
