8453757,4,B0052AQTOO,"This DVD is a nice addition to any serious Star Trek fan's collection.  While we've heard creator Gene Roddenberry talk about most of this material before -- I'm thinking especially about his reflections in THE MAKING OF STAR TREK book, the INSIDE STAR TREK LP (later CD(, RODDENBERRY: THE FINAL INTERVIEW book, and Roddenberry's VHS introduction to THE CAGE -- this is definitely the longest interview I've seen him give.  Captured here in 1981, The Great Bird of the Galaxy seems to take a genuine liking to Ellen Adelstein and her husband and because he seems at ease with them and their knowledge of STAR TREK, he doesn't seem to mind retreading, at times in slightly abbreviated fashion, some of the TREK origin stories that now have become the stuff of science fiction mythos.  It's also engaging to hear Roddenberry share his views on religion and writing.  This program is a keeper.",1457913600,4,890,4.8355263157894735
