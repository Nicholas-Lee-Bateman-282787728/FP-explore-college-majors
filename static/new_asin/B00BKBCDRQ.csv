But a little boring. Very calm and relaxing anime to say the least. The light novels were the best, I haven't had the chance to read the manga yet.",1468454400,,311,4.379310344827586
8569954,5,B00BKBCDRQ,"This is a 6 episode anime series. Yes its short with 6 episodes but it is good because any more would just ruin it. The story is about a Shikigami (japanise for the angel of death) that feels for the living and will grant that last ""message"" or ""face to face"" before takeing the soul on to the other place. No fan service or anything wierd but an EXCELLENT story. This is a good family series to own. Price is good too :)",1436140800,,421,4.0843373493975905
