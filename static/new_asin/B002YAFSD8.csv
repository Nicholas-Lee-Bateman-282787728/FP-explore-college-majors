8384114,4,B002YAFSD8,"I have appreciated watching de la Hoya and Mosley fight, but this being a ""What have you done for me lately?"" world, I'm pretty much over them. Still, this volume presents their rematch. Also included is yet another chapter in the much ballyhooed Mexican-Puerto Rican rivalry, except that this one ends as a dudder. And we also witness Manny Pacquiao's ascendancy in the boxing world as he transforms the Baby-Faced Assassin into a geriatric, ambulatory punching bag. For those who care, all the ringside fight commentaries are in English.

- Daniel Santos vs. Antonio Margarito 2 (September 11, 2004)

Their first fight back on July 21, 2001 lasted only one round and was declared a no-contest due to both fighters accruing nasty cuts. Ergo, this rematch. Of these two combatants, Margarito was deemed the tremendous puncher and brawling aggressor, with the bigger Santos relegated to the role of heady ring technician. Except that this was the night the Puerto Rican decided to stray from the pretty boxing and go with the power shots, and it worked... for a little while.

In the first round Santos hurt Margarito very badly with an overhand bomb. But Margarito is one of the most well-conditioned, fastest recuperating pugilists currently going, and hombre pressed on. Santos's boxing skills proved to be an occasional stop gap to Margarito's relentless onslaught, but the prevailing sense was that it was only a matter of time before the Tijuana Tornado would blow thru Puerto Rico. In round 5, a wicked right hand from Margarito wobbled Santos. But then, in the sixth round, a bad cut developed on Margarito's right eye. This not only brought back awful memories of the first contest's clash of heads, it also altered Santos's strategy. For Santos, the game plan now broke down to just surviving and putting enough rounds in the bank so that the he'd be ahead on points should the fight be stopped because of Margarito's gash. And then came a few more head bu++s. Margarito's cut did eventually cause the fight to be stopped, in the tenth round, and it went to the scorecards. Margarito would lose a fight in which he had been building steady momentum. A split technical decision would go Daniel Santos's way, thus leaving an unsatisfactory aroma in the arena.

- Shane Mosley vs. Oscar de la Hoya 2 (September 13, 2003)

Three years later, they did it again, and it was pretty much more of the same. Oscar de la Hoya and Shane Mosley's skill sets place them at an equal footing. Going into this one, some boxing pundits thought that the difference maker may be Oscar's new trainer Floyd Mayweather, Sr. who was rumored to have polished Oscar's talents. For sure, Oscar's long jab was more evident and it confounded Shane enough that it's safe to say it cost Shane a few rounds. Both fighters were as game as they were in the first fight, but there was a more tactical feel to this sequel. And like the first fight, Oscar racked up an early lead, but Shane came on in the latter rounds, even though the 11th round saw a de la Hoya uppercut dislodging Shane's mouthpiece. To be honest, I had the Golden Boy winning this one. But the judges gifted it to Sugar Shane, unanimously. Going by Shane's expression when Michael Buffer announced that he'd won the thing, dude was just as surprised as I was.

- Manny Pacquiao vs. Marco Antonio Barrera 1 (November 15, 2003)

Pacquiao's drubbing of Oscar de la Hoya made him into a global phenomenon. But it was Pacquiao's shocking upset of Marco Antonio Barrera in 2003 that first hinted at how special this Filipino southpaw slugger would become. I don't know if it was the fire at Big Bear - which disrupted Barrera's training camp - or because the Mexican warrior had already survived several grueling fights but, by the end of this fight, the Baby-Faced Assassin did not at all live up to his nickname. Discounting that point deducted from Pacquaio for a slip counted as a knockdown, Manny Pacquiao dominated every round from round two on. Watching Barrera try to cope with Pacman's speed and movement was like watching a blindfolded kid swinging futilely at a piata. Barrera got so flustered that, when the referee had called the doctor to check out a cut on his eye, and it seemed very much like Barrera didn't want to fight anymore. A couple of knockdowns, persistently getting battered to the cuerpo, seeing his blows have no affect on his whirling dervish of an adversary, Barrera's self-esteem must've been lower than the fattest kid in fat camp. In the eleventh round, his corner threw in the mercy towel.

I'll try to quell the hyperbole, but Manny Pacquiao is my favorite fighter. I marvel at the speed, the stamina, the power, the sheer spirit he fights with. His steady moving up in weight - and conquering - is one of the amazing feats I've ever seen in sports. If he does manage to beat Antonio Margarito later on today - it's November 13, 2010 as I'm typing this - I think he should probably retire, unless Mayweather mans up. Otherwise, I'm not sure how much longer his focus is gonna be honed in strictly on the Sweet Science. Watching the 24/7 segments leading up to Pacquiao-Margarito has me concerned. Manny seems to really love being a Congressman.

Oh, what the hell, I say if Manny beats Margarito, he should fight either Paul Williams or Sergio Martinez next. Dream even bigger, Pacman.",1289606400,,5359,4.735262593783494
