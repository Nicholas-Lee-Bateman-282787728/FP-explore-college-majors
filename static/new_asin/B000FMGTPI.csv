8124694,4,B000FMGTPI,"Dors young and sexy, Barbara Payton sleazy cheap and believable as a slut. These movies are strictly for entertainment purposes and whats wrong with that?",1474848000,,154,5.2
8124695,4,B000FMGTPI,"I never cease to marvel at just how good a number of early Hammer films really are. Of the 14 films in VCI's HAMMER FILM NOIR series (7 DVDs - 2 films per disc), Volumes 1-3 are all minor gems. Volumes 4-6 are pretty good with 2 films PAID TO KILL and BLACK GLOVE being the standouts. Only Volume 7 (THE UNHOLY 4 and  A RACE FOR LIFE) wasn't worth the trouble of releasing. The two films which make up Volume 1 are the cream of the crop with BAD BLONDE being a standout. Originally titled THE FLANAGAN BOY in Britain, this tight little number takes shopworn material and makes it fresh and interesting. Bombshell Barbara Payton is truly bad news as she seduces and then coerces naive boxer Tony Wright into murdering her older, rich husband before executing the ultimate double cross. The script is a decent combination of the THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and BODY AND SOUL, the camerawork is first rate and the direction by American director Reginald Le Borg is the best of his career. However it's the performances that really make an impact especially Barbara Payton's. When she licks her lips over the boxer, it's a highly charged moment. She did similar good work in Hammer's sci-fi romance THE FOUR SIDED TRIANGLE the same year (1953). Too bad that alcohol and regular tabloid appearances destroyed her career.

The second film MAN BAIT (the original title in England was THE LAST PAGE as a lot of the action takes place in a second hand bookstore similar to 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD) is not as good due to a rather lethargic performance from leading man George Brent. At this point in their history, it was necessary for Hammer to use an on their way up but usually on their way down American ""star"" in the lead in order to secure financing and have their movies shown in America. The ""man bait"" of the title is the 21 year old Diana Dors who's terrific but she doesn't have enough screen time. Terence Fisher's direction covers up a multitude of sins but can't wholly redeem Brent's lackluster effort which isn't bad just really underplayed. The British supporting cast are all excellent as was usually the case with all the Hammer Noirs. The B movie running times (both films are under 80 minutes) help to keep both films from wearing out their welcome although in classic B movie style they resolve themselves rather quickly. Just remember, the British approach to Noir is not nearly as dark as their American counterparts so keep that in mind when you view these. The picture quality of all the DVDs in this series was excellent. The only real drawback is the remarkably condescending commentary provided by Richard M. Roberts.",1409356800,3,2637,4.656652360515022
8124696,3,B000FMGTPI,"The image quality on these two movies is decent. Bad Blonde is the best of the two but neither title is really good. However, it should be noted that they are both film noirs. Sometimes VCI promotes their crime films as film noirs because they sell better.",1368057600,,256,4.468085106382978
8124697,3,B000FMGTPI,"Bad Blonde, starring Barbara Payton, Hammer Film Classics, 1953

Some guys will tell you straight up-never trust a blonde, a good-looking blonde, because she has nothing but murder in her heart and gold more yellow than her hair driving her soul, if she has a soul. Other guys will tell you always trust a blonde, because like the blond in Dorothy Parker's short story, ""Big Blonde,"" she has a heart of gold (and unrequited deep sexual urges too). Me, I can take them or leave, although the blonde in the British crime noir under review, Bad Blonde, should make any man think twice, no, six times before getting mixed up with her. Of course her badness drives this film, and no other attribute.

Of course the story line here is as old as the hills, or as old as there have been hot blondes giving their all to gold-digging, female god-digging, whichever came first. Lorna (played by Barbara Payton), an ex-tramp or something like that, got her hooks into an old- time Italian boxing promoter.
Strictly for the dough and security, okay, after too much time in the flops. But the guy is a buffoon, a rich old buffoon, but a buffoon. Enter one good-looking Johnny Flanagan, a young fighter with promise, and big muscles. They fall for each other, while he is training for the big fight. End of story.

Well, not quite. Although if you have seen enough crime noir you know you have seen this plot unravel before, and more elegantly, in the film adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice and others. At some point the old geezer husband is just, well, just in the way, and Lorna starts working her ""magic"". Naturally Johnny comes to see things her way, kills that old- time promoter (showing a little ingratitude by the way) by drowning him in his very own pond and that is that. Except Johnny (not Lorna though) has plenty of remorse. Remorse enough want to go to the police and confess. Lorna, in clover now, fails to see it that way and poisons her lovely Johnny. But you know she will not get away with that, no way. Bad blond, indeed

[Note: On the great blonde controversy mentioned above I truly can take them or leave them, good or bad. My preference is strictly brunettes lately (although there was a time when I had a run of red-heads but that was kid time, and in the Irish ghetto, where you could hardly walk around the block without running into one who wanted to play some game with you). And  believe brunettes are just as capable of leading you on a merry chase, of getting their hooks in you, into you good, as any dizzy blonde, Enough said.]

Man Bait, starring George Brent, Diana Dors, Hammer Film Collections, 1952

Sometimes the title of a crime noir will intrigue you, like The Postman Always Rings Twice, sometimes like this 1950s British crime noir under review, Man Bait (or another recently reviewed 1950s British noir, Bad Blonde), apparently the titles are mere happenstance. Either way this one is kind of, well, sleepy. Sleepy for the plot, and sleepy for action. Definitely a B-noir, very B.

Here is why. A low down grafter, Peter Hart, tries to steal a rare book out of a bookstore and is caught by an employee, Ruby Bruce (played by a young, and, yes, fetching Diana Dors). Instead of turning him in (making for a very short film) she gets into his slimy clutches (nice right) and makes her use her sexual prowess and position in the bookstore  to ""mark"" (one would not realize such things went on such a quaint locale) the emotionally distraught bookstore owner (played by a very un-distraught appearing George Brent).

Now Peter is strictly a con man, no rough stuff, but one night when the pair are divvying up the loot provided by their scam old Ruby takes exception to the split and Peter bops her. Dead. Our boy Peter is no fall guy though and he sets up the ""mark,"" that self-same distraught bookstore owner for Ruby's death. No way, no way in hell, distraught or not, is our heroic bookstore taking the fall. But guess who is.",1342742400,,3995,4.5748251748251745

First up we have ""BAD BLONDE"" (1953) (81 min. B/W)...under director Reginald Le Borg , producer Anthony Hinds, book author Max Catto, screenplay by Guy Elmes and  Richard H.
