8764386,2,B01H0VH3G0,"Troy (Mark Grossman) and Rachel (Celesta DeAstis) were high school sweethearts who never ""did it."" Troy wants something to take with him to college, Rachel needs to work another year. Rachel reluctantly agrees to let Troy take pics of her tatas. When Rachel finds out her and Troy are no longer ""exclusive"" she and her mom (Jennifer Dorogi) literally toss the guy out. The next thing you know her pictures are posted on a site called ""Revenge Porn"" with personal data, such as where she works. This causes issues as strangers show up and everyone in town has suddenly seen her fine proportional firm teen glands. We the audience only see bra and panty shots.

The issues were certainly overblown. Who really cares anymore? The site, when contacted refused to take down the pics unless paid, like the Jail Report. Normally they operate above board and when requested, pics are removed as they require a signed release form. Being Rachel looked young, a simple claim she is a minor, would quickly get the photo removed as sites such as Revenge Porn, know child pornography will get them shut down in an instant. 34 states have revenge porn laws including the one where this was filmed. Perhaps this wasn't the best film to draw attention to the issue.

This was an Asylum, made for US Lifetime TV. Acting and plot accordingly. No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1472256000,5,1353,4.753191489361702
