8666015,4,B00LHYCK4C,"This Movie is listed as one of the ""TOP 100 SCI-FI MOVIES"" in the book of the same name by Gary Gerani! A mix of Outer Limits and Twilight Zone, the film is of a man married--to someone NOT human! Clue?....She sleeps with her eyes open! Full of dread and atmosphere.",1473379200,,266,4.235294117647059
8666016,4,B00LHYCK4C,"This movie is very watchable as a piece of genre sci-fi, but I find to be even more interesting on the level of social commentary.  Most men find women to be aliens, don't you guys?  'Fess up.  And we are half the planet!  Be afraid, be very afraid.",1448755200,,249,4.125
8666017,5,B00LHYCK4C,"This is a very obscure film which I saw at The Music Box theater in the mid 1960s. It's a British film shot in black & white and despite being shot on a low budget, has excellent cinematography and is very chilling. I have never forgot seeing this, and when I saw it had a blu-ray release, I had to add this to my collection, even though it is a Region B release. I need to get a region free player, but very glad to obtain this film on blu-ray while it's still available! Thank you Amazon!",1424217600,3,490,4.061855670103093
8666018,4,B00LHYCK4C,"I enjoyed this film. It deals with a scientist on a research team whose goal is to travel to other planets via mental projection. Strangely, many of the members on their team die of massive electrical overloading of the brain and nervous system. The deaths turn out to be more sinister than the team seniority and government security imagine.

This is a rather low-key film and has more the flavor of a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits style story without all sorts of special effects, monster makeup and such hubbub, but is excellently handled by all the actors with fine direction. It definitely held my interest throughout. It's worth noting that two of the producers, Albert Fennel and Julian Wintle, later produced The Avengers (UK) which may provide a bit more clue to the general flavor of the film. And it's always fun to watch Patrick Newell being Patrick Newell...also a regular in the last seasons of The Avengers.

Unfortunately, there is no US Region A BluRay (or even Region 1 DVD) at this time; but if you have a multi-region BR player and enjoy more cerebral and less 'bang zoom' scifi, I'd recommend this film.",1422662400,5,1124,4.729591836734694
