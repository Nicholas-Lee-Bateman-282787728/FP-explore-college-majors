3718957,5,B001NJ19KW,"As a photography teacher I found the film outstanding for college level students or anyone who loves photography.  It has a quiet yet powerful way it moves through a story about a woman and how essentially she is saved  because of her ability with the camera and to take pictures.  The film itself is packed full of powerful images and moments of realization.  Wonderful dialogue and moments all real photographers can relate to that floats in and out of the story about photography and the position of the photographer such as quotes that went something like this ""when I am photographing I forget I am a mother"" or ""not everyone can see"".  I would watch it again and again.  If you are not a photographer but have a heart at all its an enduring story that anyone can appreciate and enjoy. Amazing film - I was carried away.",1260576000,23,825,4.54054054054054
3718958,3,B001NJ19KW,"I don't especially like a story where they show the dark side of a family life. Here, we see the unbelievable violence of a husband towards his wife and children and it is hearbreaking to watch. Swedish movies are often gloomy and depressing like this one. It is one thing to be poor, but having to deal with violence on top of that well, this is too much for me. The father's behavior is despicable and we don't understand how his wife managed to cope with it and even forgave him. Darkness at its best here!",1253404800,8,509,4.3125
3718959,5,B001NJ19KW,"EVERLASTING MOMENTS ('Maria Larssons eviga gonblick') is a quiet, gentle masterpiece of filmmaking.  The screenplay  by Niklas Rdstrm, based on a story by Agneta Ulfster-Troell and director Jan Troell, is so free of the expected extended dialogues that accompany films of this nature that it allows the magic of the period piece set in early 20th century Sweden to rely on the beauty of the cinematography by Mischa Gavrjusjov and Jan Troell and the subtle and simple film score by Matti Bye (with a little help from Massenet!). Filmed in the color scheme suggestive of the distinguished Danish painter Vilhelm Hammershi, never straying far from sepia tones that ignite the solitude and light of the Nordic countries, this film could probably be successful as a silent movie - that is how powerful the production is.

We are told in the voice over introduction that Maria Larsson (the exceptional Finnish actress Maria Heiskanen) won a camera in a lottery and the only way she would share the strange prize would be if her boyfriend Sigfrid (Mikael Persbrandt) would marry her.  The couple marries and begins a large family: Maria takes in sewing and Sigfrid works at the docks - and drinks to excess.  Maria's world becomes progressively unhappy and though she continues to have children she longs for a life free of the influence of Sigfrid's alcoholism and womanizing.  She finds her hidden camera and thinking to pawn it for money to support her children she seeks the advice of an older photographer Sebastian Pedersen (Jesper Christensen) who convinces her to discover the magic of photography as a means of expression and makes it possible for Maria to keep her camera and learn the art of photography.  In Maria's oppressive life there is now a light as seen through the lens of her camera that allows her to sustain herself through times of social change, war (WW I), Sigfrid's imprisonment, and a clandestine love affair with the kind and caring Sebastian.  The story moves slowly, like a stroll in the wintry woods, and introduces many characters whose significance grow through the film.  The ending of the story is as gentle as a dream, or as an everlasting moment.  It is sheer magic.  For this viewer this is one of the finest films to come along in years. In Swedish and Finnish with subtitles.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, September 09",1252454400,55,2357,4.891959798994975
3718960,4,B001NJ19KW,"***This review contains spoilers***

I have an old photograph of my mother when she was five years old walking down the Boardwalk in Atlantic City in 1930 with my grandparents and I often wonder what their lives were like at that moment in time. Jan Troell's ""Everlasting Moments"" attempts to do just that as he brings old family photographs to life in his sweeping family saga set in Sweden at the turn of the century.

Everlasting Moments begins in the Swedish port city of Malmo in 1907. It's a true story based on the reminiscences of Maja Larrson who is the film's narrator. She takes us back to when she was a child and we're introduced to her parents Maria and Sigfrid (Siggie) Larrson. Siggie is a dock worker who also happens to be an alcoholic. Maria (wonderfully played by Maria Heiskanen) is his long-suffering wife. Although Siggie belongs to the Temperance Society he is continually relapsing and most of the tension in the film's first half revolves around the harrowing scenes of domestic violence in which Siggie uses his wife as a veritable punching bag.

Maria is under tremendous pressure, not only from the heartache of having to deal with her often drunk and philandering husband but also raising a brood of precocious children. One day Maria rediscovers an expensive camera that she and her husband had won in a lottery at the time they got married. She decides to take a picture of her children without her husband knowing about it and brings it to a local photography shop and meets the kindly shop owner, Sebastian Pedersen. Pederson is a bit older than Maria but they soon form a lasting friendship. Pedersen eventually shows Maria how to use the camera and develop pictures.

Meanwhile, we get a real feel for the history of the times as we see what happens to Siggie as he becomes involved with Socialist and Communist agitators who seek to unionize dockworkers in their fight against the shipowners. At one point British scabs are brought in and one of the strike breakers is murdered. Siggie is a suspect for a short while but is cleared after a local floozy who he's been having an affair with provides an alibi.

To Siggie's chagrin, Maria presses forward with her fascination with photography. Eventually she starts earning extra money taking photos of people in the community. In one sad and sensitive scene, Maria declines to charge a woman who asks her if she could take a picture of her daughter who has just died after falling through the ice wandering too far out on to a not so frozen pond. The image of the deceased girl is one of the many striking images of still photography seen in this film.

Things come to a head when Siggie suspects that Maria has been having an affair with Pedersen and brutally rapes her. As a result, Marie is pregnant with another child who ends up with polio. Finally, Siggie takes things too far and drags Maria outside and almost slits her throat with a knife. As a result, he's arrested and thrown in jail (presumably there were neighbors who were witnesses to this horrible act but we never see them nor are there any scenes of Siggie being arrested and brought before a magistrate).

While I expected Maria to leave her husband and go off on her own running her own photography business, that's not what happens in the film's denouement. Instead, Maria stops taking photos for quite awhile and loses contact with Pedersen after the family moves to a different part of town. After Siggie gets out of jail, Maria decides to stick it out with him. Some say it was Maria's memories of her father exhorting her never to leave her husband since it was ""God's will"" or perhaps it was simply Maria's conservative nature. More likely it was Siggie eventually becoming more mature. He gives up the bottle, starts running a successful moving company and becomes a decent family man. It should be pointed out that Siggie is only a monster when he's drunk. Other times he's shown to be a sensitive man (in one scene, he prevents a man from abusing a horse in the street).

Maria's farewell to Pedersen is a poignant and bittersweet moment in the film. The two part knowing that their relationship was never meant to go further than it did. Pederson's shop is like an oasis for Maria while she's trying to cope with her husband in the early years. Although Pedersen is not a very 'exciting' character, and there's little conflict between the two, he's a soothing and supporting presence, contrasting nicely with the brutal and oppressive Siggie.

Some of the other characters in the film are not sufficiently developed. Siggie's 'anarchist' buddy who commits suicide due to an fulfilled life is one such character. Maja, the film's narrator, has a brief scene where she's almost molested by an employer while working as a housekeeper and then there's the youngest son who's briefly seen trying to cope with the ravages of polio--these characters and scenes seem almost like afterthoughts.

Nonetheless, 'Everlasting Moments' is still filled with indelible, everlasting moments and images (especially check out the effect that Charlie Chaplin had on the Larrson family--that's a scene you won't forget!). Jan Troell's look into the past is not sentimental but more wistful. And even more important, he teaches us about the trials, tribulations and the sacrifices made by the older generation as they stumbled into a firm and rewarding maturity.",1237939200,39,5405,4.802150537634408

3718962,5,B001NJ19KW,"Rich in substance and artistic resolution, this little gem of a foreign film has great merit. With a talented ensemble cast, the film reinforces the familiar line, they're no small parts, only small actors.  Notably, English subtitles add, rather than detract, from the overall experience.

3718963,5,B001NJ19KW,"The husband, Sigfrid Larssen, portrayed by Mikael Persbrand, is a chronic alcoholic, who physically and emotionally abuses his wife, Maria, portrayed by Maria Heiskanen.  Marias ally is photographer, Sebastian Pedersen, represented by Jesper Christiansen, who teaches her how to operate a camera and appears to be smitten with Marias natural beauty and simplicity.  Her eldest daughter, Maja, portrayed by Callin Ohrval, encourages Maria to leave her father.

This is a poignant story of how a family copes with the husband and fathers substance abuse, the familys fear of Sigfrids angry outbursts, the shame, and Maria feeling disappointed and broken. Yet Maria resolves her differences with Sigfrid, and though she may no longer love him, she respects him.

Maria, a humble, kind-hearted woman, becomes a renowned photographer in her own right.  Sigfrid starts his own business as a hauler and is able to amply provide for his family.

This is a beautifully written and portrayed story of a familys unconditional love and courage to overcome obstacles.",1497398400,,1054,5.357575757575757

Her plight can only be judged through the veil of the history of her time, and the religious and political conditions that kept women thinking they were selfish to want to fulfill a personal passion. All is expressed through Maria's quiet temperament, and strength of character to endure what she thought she must, while also finding the courage to continue taking photographs.  This is sensitively filmed, always interesting, and poignant, and not for women only.

3718986,5,B001NJ19KW,"David Lean, the famous English director of epic films, said that you should be able to cut out any frame from a roll of film, frame it and hang it on a wall. This sepia hued jewel has that quality in abundance and I, involuntarily, found myself mentally cropping out stills throughout, and with great pleasure. Considering the storyline is that of an impoverished Swedish family, the exquisite to luxurious filming is deserving of the highest praise. The gifted cinematographer is Mischa Gavrjusjov, director Jan Troell, and editor Nils Andersen. Back to the story.  Maria (Maria Heiskanen), the mother, is a quiet, determined, anchor for the family. Her wonderful creativity emerges as a result of her winning a camera in a lottery. Sigge ( Mikael Persbrandt), the father, is a brutish, violent alcoholic. It is the camera that sustains Maria, along with the intense love for her children. And it is a wise, gentle, older man, and photographer, Sebastian (Jesper Christensen), who befriends and encourages her in her photography. Her commitment to her dying father is what causes her to stay in this horrid marriage. But wanting not to spoil, I leave the rest to you.  The acting is solid. The film is an art and photography lover's masterwork!",1472428800,4,1245,4.952153110047847

3718989,5,B001NJ19KW,"A very lovely 2008 movie by Jan Troell-- maybe even a great one -- that appeals to the viewer for different kinds of reasons.  Most immediately, there is the story of a working-class woman in Sweden, in the first quarter of the 20th Century, who finds herself drawn to a relatively new technology, the camera, and finds in using it deep personal satisfaction and, later, and after some trials, a source of income for her large family at a time when her husband, for a variety of reasons, cannot be depended on as a source of income.  The photographer is Maria Larsson (Maria Heiskanen), and her story is told, with voice-over transitions, ostensibly by her eldest daughter, Maja (Callen Ohrvall).  The conflicts that arise within the Larsson family are due to the husband Sigfrid Larsson's drinking and womanizing and resenting the attention that Maria lavishes on her photography, although, with seven children she also has to clean rich people's houses and work as a dressmaker and seamstress.  Maria is drawn emotionally to Sebastien Pedersen (Jesper Christensen), an older man who encourages her to use the camera (after she comes to his shop to try to sell it to him), and he is drawn to her, but Maria, who has a strong sense of obligation to her children and a strong sense that marriage vows matter, stays with her husband, even through a period when he is imprisoned for attempted murder (of Maria) and through continuing bouts of infidelity and drunkenness.  One of the great successes of the movie is the way in which Maria's choice does not seem silly or conventional.  Sigfrid is an attractive man, with humor and affection for his wife and children, and even through his (to put it mildly) erratic behaviour, we never feel that he is despicable.  He has his success late in the movie when he starts up a hauling business with a horse that he has spontaneously saved from savage abuse.  These are complicated characters, then, and Maria Heiskanen and Mikael Persbrandt (as Sigfrid) are unostentatiously brilliant in bringing these characters to life.  Christensen has a less demanding part, but he is most touching and never pathetic as a not-fully-requited lover.

It's a great story, then, but it also raises questions about art -- a movie about still pictures!  The photographs are never theorized as art by Maria (though Pedersen hints at their aesthetic dimensions) but rather as moments that will, now that they have been captured in photographs, last for ever, as aids to memory and perhaps as historical documents of a kind.  And in the time-frame of the film, it was still a question whether or not narrative (for example, in the novel) was ""really art.""  Maria's life is pretty much coincident with the great modernists (Joyce among them) who helped break away from the assumption that aesthetic form was static and led readers and viewers to a much more fluid view of form.  The sense one gets from Maria's stills, though, is less of static form than of frozen narrative, so the movie's medium and Maria's reinforce one another.  It's a beautiful looking movie too, with the handling of color -- from sepia-like to something more lively and varied -- being particularly effective.  So -- just brilliantly conceived and executed and touchingly acted.",1469059200,12,3273,4.891500904159132

Story about a woman that lives with her violent and drunk husband in the Southern tip of Sweden. They live a very hard life especially for their children. She is a strong woman, raises the children, works as a housekeeper and copes with their poverty. When newly married she won a camera in a lottery, one day she finds it and takes it to a photo shop to pawn it so she can buy food to feed her family. There she meets Sebastian ...

The period environment and the poverty of the main character are realistically depicted as is her strength and determination in the face of many challenges. The story is touching and has a couple twists that are unexpected and add to the interest. The opening narration tells the audience that winning a camera before getting married eventually made her life livable.

3719038,3,B001NJ19KW,"I would have given it 4 stars except for some poor editing, as the scenes sometimes jumped from one to the other without a good transition.  Also Maria's motivations are obscure. Her friend says that she has a love of photography and an artistic eye, but we don't hear that or see that from her.  And her photos are totally non descript and nowhere near the creative work that was already being done in that era.

Further, as a photographer, I am always annoyed with stupid mistakes, like Maria shooting fast moving objects that would have been impossible with those cameras, or standing too  close taking a large group photo.  It shows a lack of research, especially needed when the main subject of the film is a photographer.

At the end of the film the daughter comments that she doesn't know why her mother stayed with the father and neither do we.

On the plus side, we do get involved with the story and the main character.  And most importantly we want to watch the whole movie to see what happens.  Also  the cinematography is lovely, with unsaturated colors that are evocative of the era.",1425686400,7,1097,4.579487179487179

A difficult story that is ""shown""  or illustrated, by the characters actions rather than ""told"" to the viewer. There is some narrative overview through the eyes of the oldest child in the family,  however the viewer is mostly left to discover personalities , thoughts/emotions or relationships by observation. Set during the turn of the century Sweden through the 1920's, the story is the life of a woman and her family, living  in the poorest of circumstances, who manage to cope and find beauty in spite of all they endure. The woman finds a forgotten camera in a closet,and takes it to a shop in order to pawn it for money. The rest of the plot hinges on this action,so as not to reveal too much, I'll just say- it changes everything for her. There""s a good deal of inherent violence in certain scenes regarding her alcoholic husband,(who is a philanderer as well), but watching the characters overcome their flaws and situations is just a really good story . For those who like a film that makes you think. Interesting historical aspects and events are woven in as well.

It was a true story, and that is great, but it was also executed in a way that was very believable... very realistic.

The dad has major drinking problems, takes a mistress and has little respect for what she is doing, but at the core is a decent man.  No big revelations, but over the course of a half dozen years the viewer becomes immersed in the characters' struggles and achievements.",1405555200,,723,4.640625

Set in the time both before, during and after the First World War, it was less about conflict between nations and more about conflict between men and women, especially husbands and wives, and the cultural expectations for their respective roles. It also contrasted the differences of men and women in countries over most of the western world, during this period, based on their socioeconomic statuses.

I relate to this movie because I look at my own mother, who grew up during war times, struggled with a bad marriage, and the toll it took on her life.  While this movie shows a woman who managed to go beyond her circumstances to find some beauty in the ugliness around her.  And how could she not fall in love with the man who brought it to her.  Not LOVE, like we think in romance...but love of the human spirit, love for someone who brings that awakening to you, does not have to have sexual overtones - which is what a person would have to notice, and why it was uncomfortable for her...he appealed to her heart in that manner !

Yes, it tells a familiar story of a woman struggling to keep her family together through hard times, but at a time when photography was still something magical. The fortune of a simple camera, in the hands of someone with a gifted eye, makes the tale unfold in a unique and special way.

The cinematography of the movie itself kept me gasping at the splendor;  the capturing of light and shadows and focus, the rich textures of fabrics in the period wardrobe, the details of antique cameras and other scenery; they just keep coming, scene after scene.

It's a heart touching story that's enjoyable in and of itself, but if you're someone who appreciates photography, you're certain to love this film.

3719196,1,B001NJ19KW,"I find it difficult that she stayed at all. There are many redeemable characteristics in the beauty and quest for identity, but none are so unforgivable as the beastly man's behavior, toward his wife. This was not true love; for him it was possession of a commodity with violent and tragic acts to protect his male ego, and for her, it was the classic bondage of a wife whose self was lost without voice but through the lens of a camera. Her world was a mythic creation to escape a man who should have been more than imprisoned for his carnage of another's soul, mind and body, he should have been hanged by due process of the law. This film is tragic. Anyone who goes on about it's beauty, affirms her loyalty based on historic biblical vulgarities, and excuses this man's actions by needing to explain that he is a drunkard are themselves delusional and comatose offspring of a culture of indifference. Stand by your man? Virtuous? Strong woman? The film is sadly unintelligent and poorly framed in assertions that only resonate with the sordid and dark side of men in love with power, and women in love with grim fairytales.",1388793600,2,1127,4.611940298507463

This movie impacts me at a time in my life where human complexities are in the forefront.  This husband and wife had qualities that we--rather, I--loved and hated.

3719216,5,B001NJ19KW,"""Everlasting Moments"" is simply a masterpiece of cinematographic art.

Set in a period of life when unending trials, hardship and tribulations are the norm, we find a gentle but indomitable spirit in Maria. The tale enfolds through the gripping childhood memories of Maja, Mara's daughter. Caught in what often seems to be a bleak, loveless and violent marriage, the two most rewarding treasures in her mother's life are her children and a camera won in a lottery. The camera opens a door that allows Maria to escape, to touchingly experience a tranquility and sense of self that is too often missing in her own troubled life.  This is further nurtured by the guidance and friendship of Mr Pedersen. This cultured, educated and gentle camera shop owner, recognizes her hidden talent in seeing what is so often ignored by others. Her ability to see the beauty in the simplicity of everyday life through the lens of her camera reminds us of how fleeting these moments can be. Moments, that once captured by her camera's eye, are moments for forever. Despite her heartfelt sense of loss when the kind Mr. Pedersen moves away to be with his own daughter, he leaves her a touching and lasting gift: how to be true to oneself and one's dreams, no matter how small, in the face of adversity.

3719238,5,B001NJ19KW,"I'm losing count of the number of foreign films I've discovered that I would like to show to friends. Unfortunately, the vast majority would not subject themselves to a subtitled film, so this review will have to be my outlet. Maybe it will persuade one person, somewhere, to watch this wonderful film?

I first saw Everlasting Moments on cable about two years ago. Although I admired it, I felt that it dragged a little at times and I awarded it 3.5/5. I don't know whether my tastes have matured significantly since that time, but I was captivated by last night's viewing on Criterion Blu-ray.

The story tells the true story of Maria Larsson (Heiskanen), who is distantly related to members of director Jan Troell's family. It opens in the first decade of the 1900s and ends in the early 1920s. The story is narrated by Maria's daughter, Maja, and the story is based on her real memoirs.

What can you expect from Everlasting Moments?

The story shows life in Sweden approximately 100 years ago. It's a brutally honest portrayal of poverty and hardship, and how Maria found an escape from that gritty existence through her photography. We are told at the outset that Maria won a camera in a lottery. The ticket was purchased by Sigfrid Larsson (Persbrandt), and he thought the camera should be his because he bought Maria the ticket. She told him that he would have to marry her if he wanted to share it, so he did.

Sigfrid is a complicated character. We discover that he is an alcoholic, and that he also has a weakness when it comes to other women. He appears to love Maria, but he's a violent man when under the influence of drink, causing all manner of problems for Maria and their children.

Maria's life changes when she discovers the camera in a closet one day and decides to pawn it for food. She takes it to a local photography store and encounters the owner, Sebastian Pedersen (Christensen). Maria has no idea of the camera's value, but Pedersen tells her that it is a good one. In fact, he's not completely sure of its value either. He tells her that he will buy it, but that she should keep it and use it until he establishes its value. The cost of the chemicals and photographic plates will be deducted from the price when he eventually buys it. Maria begins to use the camera and discovers that she likes it. Pederson admires her work and thinks she has real skill.

Have you ever uncovered a talent of your own that you never knew you had? That is part of the magic of Everlasting Moments. We live in a world where people are very guarded and often reluctant to show anyone a glimpse of their true feelings. Most reactions we see in others in a social setting are fake to some degree. They feign interest in what you are saying and force themselves to laugh or smile. It's rare to see genuine delight, and when I see it, I remember it. It's more common to see honest reactions from children because they don't care so much about how others perceive them.

I mention all this to illustrate the power of Maria's reaction when she realizes that she has a talent for photography. It is pure magic to her and Maria Heiskanen captures that feeling and depicts it perfectly. It's so effective that I felt everything that Maria might feel and I began to connect deeply with her character and her situation.

Although Maria doesn't boast about her talent or think that it's special, she begins to draw the attention of her friends and acquaintances. Photography was not common 100 years ago, so Maria finds that some people are willing to pay for her work and commission her to do more.

Like all of my favorite dramas, Everlasting Moments takes the time to establish its characters. Maria ultimately has seven children and we learn about what is important to the older ones. Sigfrid does his best to be a good father and husband, but it's not really enough for Maria. However, she takes marriage seriously and we see that she isn't the kind of woman to cheat, even when she observes Sigfrid openly flirting with other women.

Maria develops a deep friendship with Sebastian, which develops as she visits his store more regularly. This relationship is arguably the very heart of the film. Will Maria be tempted to abandon her husband or break her marriage vows?

It's also interesting that Sigfrid is jealous of Maria's relationship with Sebastian, even though he only ever suspects that something might be going on. He conveniently overlooks the fact that he is involved with other women himself and sees it as completely insignificant. He holds Maria to a higher standard of behavior.

I won't reveal the whole story or the ending, but some of the subject matter may disturb a few viewers, even though there is no nudity or bad language. It's a realistic portrayal of Maria's life, and that inevitably leads to a few scenes that are hard to watch.

If you enjoy character studies and seeing how people might have lived a century ago, Everlasting Moments might be for you. The Blu-ray presentation is excellent and exactly what you would expect from Criterion. The special features include a look at Jan Troell's career in film (61 minutes), and two documentaries on the film and Maria Larsson's story (29 minutes and 10 minutes). There's also a 20-page book which includes an essay about the film.",1346198400,19,5310,4.6471215351812365
3719239,5,B001NJ19KW,"Jan Troell's `Everlasting Moments', adapted from the memoirs of Maja Oman, focuses on the Larsson family during the early 1900's living in Sweden.  Maria Larsson is a young mother, aged by the harshness of life, who struggles to raise her children while battling her husband's drinking problem and his bout with local floozies.  Maria's husband Sigfrid is a man of undeniable charm and spunk.  He is endearing, but he is also selfish and prone to drink and at times physically aggressive.  Told through the point of view of their eldest daughter Maja, `Everlasting Moments' is a beautifully constructed film that lets us into the lives of a family working desperately to remain intact despite opposing forces.

Those forces are none other than life in general.

Troell's talent for storytelling is undeniable.  `Everlasting Moments' is above all else exclusively nostalgic for it is unraveled in a way that feels organic and sentimental.  There is a beautiful character to the film.  While being released in 2008, there is something about this film that feels very old, vintage, in a very good way.  The story itself is one that feels rustic in nature, like a film that could have been unearthed in the 30's.  The cinematography, which leans on the side of sepia tones, also lends a nice edge to the film.

And then you have the performances.

I'm going to single out Mikael Persbrandt because, for me, he is the soul of this film.  Sure, he is the chief antagonist and so one may argue that his wife, portrayed by Maria Heiskanen (also very good) or even his daughter Maja (portrayed by various actresses) would be the heart of the film, but almost everything that doesn't revolve around the camera in question (such a marvelous prop in order to convey the film's central theme of memory) revolves around Sigfrid, the crux for almost every action.  Persbrandt is a new actor for me.  I saw him in 2010's Oscar winning `A Better World' and I was wholly impressed with him there.  It is here though where he completely entangled me.  The way that he plays to every facet of Sigfrid's personality is glorious.  Whilst maintaining a sense of aggression and careless endangerment (the physical scenes with Maria are completely believable) and juggling his salacious endeavors, Persbrandt underscores Sigfrid's actions with a sense of charm that makes you want to root for him.  You want him to turn around and mend things with his wife because you really like him.  Early on, while attending church, we witness a tear leave his eyes as he sings of the folly of the drink, and you want to hug him.

Such a tremendous performance.

`Everlasting Memories' captures a time and a place with accuracy, but more importantly with love and passion.  The closing sentiments regarding the memories captured with Maria's camera are endearing and completely telling of the power of this particular story because they help put all of the film's `moments' into perspective.

I highly recommend this.",1342742400,2,2980,4.900199600798403
3719240,5,B001NJ19KW,"Everlasting moments is set in Sweden at the beginning of the 20th century. Maria Larsson is trying to raise her family of several children in times of economic hardship. Her husband is a drunk and occasionally gets work at the docks or in nearby areas. Maria works as a maid and as a seamstress to try and make ends meet. One day she comes across a camera, and meets a professional photographer named Pedersen, who takes her under his wing and teaches her how to use the camera, to process the negatives and to make prints. And the story is told for the next decade of Maria's life, and her family, and her relationship with the camera and Pedersen.

Maria Heiskanen is simply superb as Maria Larsson and all the major cast members turn in excellent performances as well. The story is simply and beautifully told, and draws the viewer in to experience life in a different place at a different time. If you enjoy good cinema this is a must watch.

3719244,5,B001NJ19KW,"In 1971, Jan Trell made an indelible mark among American audiences, with The Emigrants, and it's sequel, The New Land. He's had some hits and misses in the meantime, but 35 years later he made Everlasting Moments, a wonderful story about Swedish artist Maria Larsson, with a terrific backstory. Beautifully filmed, and directed with the precision of a master, Maria's story cannot fail to intrigue. Maria Heiskanen as Maria handles the central role with confidence and depth, a tough role, multi-layered and complete. Equally as fine is Mikael Persbrandt as the husband she's reluctant to abandon, an innately nice guy who cannot stand being challenged... especially by a woman; the turn of the century attitudes are clearly explained. Though her husband's a womanizer, Maria has a sweet, unrequited association with a camera store owner who recognizes her talent. Morals, as they were, are well explored. The Criterion DVD 2-disc release is rife with extras and interviews. Great acting and direction, this is a film to watch and appreciate. On many Top 10 lists.",1305417600,3,1064,5.15606936416185
3719245,5,B001NJ19KW,"The GREAT Jan Troell created a very special work of art in Everlasting Moments.

There are enough reviews to describe this period piece.

All of the reviews explain the beautiful story, this beautiful struggle, this period in Sweden's history, this simple strong story and etc.

The reviews extol the great performances of Mikael Persbrandt, Maria Heikskanen, and Jesper Christiensen; all deserving of high praise. The actors gave us the truth. They reached the pinnacles of their professions, the screenplay is perfect and the direction of these world class talents is masterful.

I will state that this director / cinematographer is a master artist. This film has received worldwide acclaim for good reason.

The hues and tones in the film, sometimes grainy, sometimes clean, these perfect blends from one shot to another, these masterful uses of light and sound; tell many parts of the story without dialogue, without words. Just BEAUTY IN ART.

We must be grateful every time Mr. Troell gives us a piece of himself.

I will let all the other reviews give the rest away.

This film is one of my top ten of the decade from 2000 to 2010

Everlasting Moments is a Masterpiece

****

Jan Troell's Masterwork:

I am praying that the Criterion Collection chooses to remaster and distribute one (2) of history's greatest works: The Emigrants and The New Land. I greatly hope they would give it the same treatment in their remastering and production quality as they gave ""Fanny & Alexander"".

The Emigrants and The New Land are Mr. Troell's MASTERWORKS. These films were directed and FILMED by Jan Troell in 1970.

They are REAL film experiences above anything I have seen. We (the audience) are THERE in the 1800's struggling with Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman is a very difficult time in Sweden's history.

I have seen these films and they are the best of the best.

I have seen both films on VHS (American DUBBED release) and in full Swedish without subtitles. It was crazy to dub these films because, the films lose authenticity, due to language barriers when the Swedes immigrate to America and of course for every other reason to never take the original native words from MASTER ACTORS and writers voices.

The films are so great that: Even dubbed, the Emigrants was nominated for the Oscar for best film against The Godfather and Cabaret. I LOVE Godfather parts I & II with a passion, still, quite possibly, the Emigrants should have won the Academy Award.

Nearly 40 years later Mr. Troell created Everlasting Moments.

Jan Troell is one of the greatest film directors and cinematographers in the history of film, from any country on earth!",1301011200,,2642,4.8702460850111855
3719246,5,B001NJ19KW,"I watched this one late one night, streamed via N-----x, maybe the best time to view film like this one (you are not distracted). I usually give a N----x film about 20 minutes.  If I loose interest, it's on to the next one. This one is just plain good. Worth seeing; worth buying too. Someone interested in photography, especially during it's earliest years--to see how it was done so long ago--would like the film. Psychology students would have a field day with it. That's obvious by what other reviews say about the characters.  What do I see? One's loyalty. That's how I would sum up the wife. One's kindness. As in Mr Peterson's character throughout the film, obvious from that very first scene in his shop.  Those of us who know the great Emile Zola may well say he wrote the story, that's why the film is so good. Then there is much attention to detail too. For example: that Contessa camera and those old Singer sewing machines we see; they are magnificently restored and working too. Finally, the title: it may well apply to a Contessa camera seen through out the film and introduced at the very beginning. It's in the last scene too. Moments captured by it, whose shots can be preserved and looked at so many years later.",1299024000,,1231,4.5610859728506785
3719247,5,B001NJ19KW,"""Everlasting moments"" brought us back again the great Jan Troel (who shocked the world with his classics The new Land and The emigrants) .

Through an arresting photography, filmed in sepia, Troel recreates the first two decades focusing about a smart woman and brilliant wife who gets to find thanks to the raising photographic camera a place for herself through the art, despite the fact she is abused and beaten by a mischievous husband, he faces this arid environment until reaching her bliss.

The pastoral approach, the superb dialogues, the camera handling, artistic direction and the towering performances of all cast allow me to affirm this is a majestic masterwork.

3719248,5,B001NJ19KW,"This review contains ""spoilers"", so for those to which this causes distress I offer fair warning.

There's a singular moment anyone who has ever held a camera recognizes, a moment of absolute clarity, a recognition that somehow seeing the world through those lens invites a different view than what our eyes initially present. A professional photographer can probably wax poetic about the virtues of image capture far better than I, but even a casual photographer can recognize the key to great photography is how the image is lit and framed. It's an innate talent some appear to be blessed with: the protagonist Maria Larsson of ""Everlasting Moments"" certainly was, along with this cinematographer of this beautifully shot 2008 Swedish film.

First, a word about the quality of the transfer. Considering this is a Criterion release, I expected the best, but on very rare occasions I've been a bit disappointed with their work. ""Everlasting Moments"" is filmed in something of a degraded color scheme which is closer to sepia tone than sharp color, no doubt an artistic decision on the part of the director. That said, the image on this Blu-Ray is extremely sharp and full of detail and texture, which is accompanied by a heavy sheen of grain. I was often impressed with the quality of this transfer, a transfer that highlights the beauty of the cinematography and remains faithful to the director's original intentions. I've not a single complaint in this department.

The essay booklet and supplementary material are notably quite substantial, a factor which makes the steep Criterion price tag worth it. The centerpiece of the four included special features is an hour long career retrospective on the work of director Jan Troell titled ""Troell's Magic Mirror"". The presentation is a bit pretentious at times, but can be easily overlooked with the abundance of information and interviews concerning a fascinating life and career. Were I forced to estimate, there's roughly forty five to fifty minutes of excellent viewing and about ten minutes of extraneous filler. The second feature is a half hour piece titled ""Troell Behind the Camera"". This functions as more of a ""making of"" special focusing on ""Everlasting Moments"". The third feature is a nine minute piece called ""The True Story of Maria Larsson"" featuring a voiceover by Troell's wife discussing the reality behind the drama along with some of Maria's photographs. The fourth and final feature is a two minute theatrical trailer.

""Everlasting Moments"" focuses primarily on the rocky marriage between Maria and her husband, along with the struggles such a contentious relationship has on their numerous children. Sigfrid Larsson is a strong, handsome, talented man who doesn't shy away from a hard day's work. Unfortunately he's also a bitter, violent alcoholic and habitual womanizer. Maria Larsson, for her part, is reserved and demure - but not submissive. Upon discovering a long forgotten camera among her possessions, Maria takes it to the local photography studio to see if it needs repair and possibly sell it. The proprietor of the shop, Sebastian Pederson, immediately takes a liking to Maria and offers to eventually purchase the camera.

In the meantime, he allows her to keep it and use it, with the intention of deducting the cost of the supplies from the purchase price. Maria is a natural photographer, capable of capturing hauntingly beautiful images under the most austere circumstances. With the encouragement of Mr. Pederson her hobby becomes her escape mechanism from the struggles of everyday life, much as husband chooses to escape via excessive drinking. It's an interesting contrast.

Aside from the excellent premise, I must give special mention to the outstanding production values of the film, which enabled the general feel of an early twentieth century village to be captured in glorious detail. Anyone who has enjoyed the production design of films such as ""My Left Foot"", ""Pelle the Conqueror"", or the more recent ""The White Ribbon"" will surely marvel at the exemplary work of ""Everlasting Moments"".

Prior to viewing this film, one should know that the film remains almost entirely focused on Maria's family for the two hour duration. I've read a certain element of reviews, both professional and amateur, that complain that the film is too slowly paced and borderline uninteresting. I never found the film to be either, but I can understand some viewers may be put off by the great detail paid to the Brief Encounter-esque relationship between Maria and Mr. Pederson or the quite normal machinations of the family in general.

Indeed, I found the film to be rife with interesting diversions such as the detail paid to the odd jobs Sigfrid received over the years, including the harsh nature of the work and the apparently futile labor strikes. More than that, the film is so perfectly cast that it's quite easy to find oneself swept away by the interactions of the characters. Watching Maria's unbridled joy at noticing her photograph was printed in the newspaper is one of many moments very nearly guaranteed to make the viewer smile. By contrast, it's nearly unbearably sad when Sigfrid's friend Englund meets his end. None of which would be possible, of course, unless the characters engaged the viewer on an emotional level.

It's been suggested that ""Everlasting Moments"" makes some sort of feminist statement or carries a message of female empowerment. I found the tale rather contrary to that interpretation. If the film is explored by those terms I find it more of a love story than anything else, albeit a thoroughly unconventional one. Perhaps a ""fractured fairy tale"" for adults. We know Maria deeply loves Sigfrid, primarily because she remains with him despite his numerous and troublesome faults. This is particularly highlighted by her choice not to sell his prized horse while he was imprisoned, despite the desperately needed financial benefits of doing so, despite the fact that he often displayed a general indifference towards her feelings, and despite the fact that he often acted as a hindrance to her designs of being a photographer.

Some have misinterpreted the ending as too saccharine and therefore unrealistic, due to a perceived impression that Sigfrid suddenly alters his behavior from a bitter, violent alcoholic to a more stable, loving man. The ending, though, is what the viewer wishes to make of it. The family's fortunes may have changed, and there's that gloriously shot scene of Maria and Sigfrid joyously dancing, but Sigfrid may never have changed. The only certain element is that Maria stood by him. On that note, suffice it to say that while it's true ""Everlasting Moments"" is based on a true story, it's not a biopic in the strictest sense, and is closer to a fictional drama based on real events.

The lingering question most seem to be left with is why exactly did Maria stand by her husband? It could be a myriad of reasons. Perhaps it was due to her fear for her spiritual well-being, as her father had warned that no one should put asunder what God brought together. Perhaps it was because he was a hard worker, a good provider and he did, at least, care very much for his children. Perhaps on some level Maria was attracted to his mischievous nature, that for all the compassion and tenderness the Mr. Pedersons of the world have to offer, they cannot match the roguish charm of her husband. Or maybe, just maybe, it truly was love.",1278547200,10,7478,5.0274414850686036
3719249,4,B001NJ19KW,"There's something almost too clean and perfect about Jan Troell's depiction of life in Sweden in the early 1900s. The film depicts the poverty and the troubles of one ordinary working class family, a family whose struggle to get by isn't helped by a violent father, a dock worker and labourer, whose drinking binges gradually come to terrorise the family, while his carrying-on with barmaids bring down the family name. Seen through the eyes of their daughter Maja Larsson, it's almost as if the worst horrors are kept private, the film's tasteful lighting, sepia tints and sensitive piano score from Matti Bye only adding to the impression of a somewhat idealised depiction of events that really aren't that pleasant at all.

In the end however, and even throughout, the strength of the film is indeed in its subtlety, in its refusal to appeal to the viewer's sentiments in regard to poverty and brutality of an underprivileged upbringing, and instead focus on the positive aspects of family togetherness and their attempts to rise above their troubles. In narrative terms, it's done with great sensitivity and subtlety through the device of the mother Maria Larsson's discovery of the miracle and beauty of photography and a deep friendship that she strikes up with the owner of a photography shop - two events that help her create for herself a life of her own.

The real strength however is in the performances that get to the heart of the characters and the times they live in. All of them are exceptional, but particularly from Maria Heiskanen, who delicately captures the nuances of a remarkable range of emotions that her character must undergo, all of them suppressed by the need for propriety, for her inability to understand the emotions that arise within her, and simply from a strict upbringing that doesn't allow their expression - but woe betide the person who takes that surface impassivity for weakness.

The gorgeous cinematography, the film's wonderful lighting and colour tints come across exceptionally well on the UK DVD release. Only fixed subtitles which are very small indeed spoil the overall impression. Dolby Digital 2.0 and 5.1 audio mixes are available. Extra include a Photo Gallery and a half-hour making of feature Troell Behind The Camera, which looks at the original true story that the film is based on with some of Maria Larsson's original photographs.",1266192000,8,2389,5.012594458438287

Her abusive alcoholic husband, Sigfrid Larssen (Mikael Persbrand), looks to have no future at all, but the film (and real life, evidently) worked out beautifully for both of them.

Larsson became a renowned photographer, and made her living in that way. Her abusive husband ultimately cleaned up his act, and established a successful hauling business.
