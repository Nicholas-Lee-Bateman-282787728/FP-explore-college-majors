2261893,5,B00092ZT5U,"If you are Cuban this movie will mean the world to you. My husband and I are Cuban and this movie really moved us. These people depicted, are our people, they are the mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, uncle, aunts and cousins we have left behind when our families left the island. And they want to be free too, but like everything in life, freedom comes with a price and some people don't want to pay the price no matter what the benefit. Whether you were born in Cuba or another country, everyone should see this movie and be grateful we live in the United States of America.",1124064000,4,577,4.401869158878505

8056923,5,B00092ZT5U,"Este documental es uno de mis preferidos. No solamente es realista, sino que ademas te muestra diferentes enfoques de una misma realidad. Te muestra la situacion de cinco o seis balseros (gente que no tienen nada en comun los unos con los otros) y te deja ver todo lo que esta gente hace para salir de Cuba, su llegada a los Estados Unidos y como se desarrollan sus vidas al cabo de los aos. Es un documental completo. Pienso que cualquier persona lo deberia ver independientemente de su nacionalidad, porque en realidad este es un tema que nos concierne a todos. Balseros es ameno, es real, es capaz de tocate el corazon.... Cualquier emigrante se puede identificar con muchos de los problemas por los que estas personas pasan. Yo se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo; yo misma no me canso de verlo. (la musica es estupenda, interpretada por una vocalista cubana llamada Lucrecia, derroche de voz y de lo mejor de la musica cubana). No dejen de verlo.",1303171200,,948,4.615384615384615
8056924,4,B00092ZT5U,"This was an interesting documentary about a brief period of time during the Clinton administration in which Cubans were so desperate to leave Cuba (either to reunite with family in the United States or to come to what they thought were cities of gold) that they risked their lives and took to the sea on flimsy rafts that I wouldn't get into a pool on.  The film documented several people making their rafts, putting them out to see, being turned back to Cuba to be held at Guantanamo Bay, being given lottery tickets to come to the U.S. and then how they faired once they got here.  It seemed, for many, to be a hard life they were leaving and a hard life they were coming to.  The documentary doesn't focus much on the politics of what was going on at the time -- there are some brief mentions of Castro opening the flood gates and letting people leave if they wanted and Clinton turning people away for a brief time, but most of the film discusses the hopes and dreams of people thinking there was a better way of life out there and how desperate they were to get to it.

An interesting film and worth watching for some perspective.",1204848000,,1135,4.3649289099526065
8056925,5,B00092ZT5U,"The movie documents the lives of half a dozen Cubans as they struggle to escape their wretched lives to reach the land of dreams. Seen in a braoder context, I could immediately relate to the hopes and aspirations of people in various corners of the third world as they seek to make a home in the West.
Most interesting was to note how fragile human relationships are - majority of these 6 Cubans who finally make it to America find loving and living with people against all promises made to loved ones when departing. Since this documentary tracks the lives of these people across several years, it provides a rich historical context to measure the reality against the dreams that these immigrants had when departing for America.
Thankfully, the movie stays away from any political overtones (as in Castro-bashing, or America/ CIA bashing).",1182124800,8,840,4.881118881118881
8056926,2,B00092ZT5U,"The documentary is one of the few that Fidel Castro will allow to show on the communist Cuban television. It shows the negative side of the balseros immigrants. Completely pessimist and intentional depressing and some times it make fun about Cubans. No a good example. The director picked a very poor town were everybody is black and unlettered. The other ninety percent of the rafter or Balseros, not showed on this documentary of course, are mostly white, blue collar worker, professionals, and artists. I see then all the time. Why this documentary doesn't show to the world that Cuban is the minority more represented on the highest levels of the united stated government. Balseros that came here to work hard, learn the language, make money without selling drugs. It is the type of material that makes happy those that use to ware Che Gevara tee-shirt. I am sorry about my English, I am just a Balsero that came here eight years ago and now I am American citizen, own a hause,  have my own insurance business and most at all, I am free and proud to be a cuban balsero.",1147910400,14,1073,4.647368421052631
8056927,5,B00092ZT5U,"""Balseros"" is movie of deep commitment executed by a team of heavily talented reporters and film professionals.  The work effort covers a period of almost eight years, starting with the so-called ""Balseros"" crisis of 1994, when - in shades of the Mariel Boatlift in 1980 - a policy shift by Fidel's government sends thousands of industrious Cubans streaming towards the shores of Florida.

The access the film team has to the island is unprecedented.  You see the rafts being crafted and carried through the streets.  When protagonist Guillermo Armas rides to the shore with this raft, he's cordoned by a wave of joyous bicyclists.  What an amazing scene.  In the meantime, the camera captures the seedy and rundown nature of present-day Havana.

Where ""Balseros"" stands apart is in carrying the film through to 2001, when we see what has become of the seven protagonists. You have to give immense credit to co-directors and writers Carles Bosch & Josep Dom&egrave;nech for the effort and skill in putting together this tale.

And, in a film with standout moments, here's mine:  the team takes to the waters to document the journeys.  At times, it encounters hauntingly empty rafts.  The voice over gently tells you about the implications of an empty raft.  All you have to do is juxtapose the flimsiness of some of these vessels vs. the raging currents in the straits and it's not difficult to imagine how these journeys came to a ghostly end.

Good complements to ""Balseros"" are ""Finding Ma&ntilde;ana"" Mirta Ojito's outstanding 2005 memoir of the the Mariel Boatlift, Reinaldo Arenas' ""Before Night Falls"" (acclaimed author Arenas also came over in Mariel) and ""Azucar Amarga,"" another great film with outstanding live footage (spliced into a compelling fictional story).

The movie follows seven specific protagonists.  I found it hard to distinguish the threads at times, but Spanish producer Bausan Films has an outstanding press package on its web site and it contains a little cheat sheet of the seven, which I'm pasting in here because I think it'll really help your watching of the film:
