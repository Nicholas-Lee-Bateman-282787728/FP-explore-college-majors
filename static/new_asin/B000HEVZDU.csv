8139088,3,B000HEVZDU,"This is a low budget movie but well performed by the cast. It works as a classic circus movie since the characters are not cartoon-ish or overly cliche. Circus movie aficionados will need this in their collection.  Appears to have been made by copying off of a VHS or 16-mm print, is low quality but totally viewable.",1493942400,,317,4.56140350877193
8139089,5,B000HEVZDU,If you like the circus you will like this movie. Shows the old time version.,1477094400,,76,4.133333333333334
8139090,4,B000HEVZDU,"Under The Big Top (1938) is about a female aerialist who is the object of attention of two male aerialists.  This movie is pretty short (59 minutes), but entertaining.  Filmed in black and white, it has some good cinematography, good circus acts, and a decent story and plot.

If you like carnival and circus movies, I recommend seeing this movie.",1389484800,,347,4.75
8139091,5,B000HEVZDU,"Saw this movie when I was a kid, and since I collect these old movies, this was a delightful addition to my movie collection.",1339200000,,125,4.25
8139092,3,B000HEVZDU,"Since this was a very old film, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  However, if you are a circus fan, you might enjoy it.",1268265600,,134,3.6206896551724137
8139093,3,B000HEVZDU,"I seem to be reviewing lots of 1930s titles from poverty row studio Monogram at the moment, but UNDER THE BIG TOP (1938) is one that I'm really surprised never found a bigger audience.

Marjorie Main stars in this brisk circus melodrama.  She plays Sara Post, the tough-talking manager of a circus that has hit the skids during the darkest days of the Depression.  The last thing Sara needs is to be saddled with her orphaned niece Penny (Charlene Wyatt), but she turns the situation to her advantage when the kid accidentally sets fire to the tent!  Thanks to insurance money, Sara re-builds the dying circus into a thriving business, and as the story picks up fifteen years later, a now grown-up Penny (played by Anne Nagel) is the troupe's biggest and most beloved trapeze star.  But not everything is rosy: Sara's relationship with Penny, which has always been strained, becomes threatened by Penny's illicit romance with trapeze costar Pablo (Grant Richards).

UNDER THE BIG TOP is an hour full of circus thrills, melodramatic dialogue and cute romance.  It's not exactly ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", but if you like the late 1930s Monogram productions, you'll know what to expect from this title.  Marjorie Main delivers one of her classic, hard-boiled performances as a woman who's all prickles on the surface but hides a tender heart.  Lovely Anne Nagel glows as the older Penny; the aerial sequences are beautifully shot.

Alpha's DVD comes from a basic but very watchable print.  Most of the damage is confined to reel-cues, and the soundtrack is easily heard.  If you collect the 'classics' of Monogram, you'll definitely enjoy UNDER THE BIG TOP.",1215043200,5,1658,4.924460431654676
8139094,5,B000HEVZDU,"The point of this film, obviously, is to show you a lot of amazing circus stunts and it does that very well. The trapeze shots are the highlights of the film, bug I also liked the clowns. The plot is an extended boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back romance of the type that I am a huge fan of. I guess the idea was to get the boys into the movie theater with the circus stuff and to bring the girls in with the romance. If so,they had the right idea and made a great movie that you can watch with you boyfriend or with your female friends. Thumbs up!",1148428800,2,564,3.956140350877193
8139095,5,B000HEVZDU,"""Isn't it strange? `Under The Big Top' made me nostalgic for a time and life I've never known. But great movies do that to us, and I adored this vintage classic. My heart goes out to the characters of Anne Nagel and Grant Richards...what a unique premise - star-crossed lovers in the circus. Where is this kind of magic today?""",1146441600,2,327,4.466666666666667
