5310391,3,B009AVCA94,Very fun and great exercise. They go through the moves very fast though and expect you to pause the DVD to repeat the moves yourself.,1357689600,4,133,4.36
5310392,1,B009AVCA94,"Warning* using these moves in public may result in severe mocking:) If you were looking for the choreography moves you saw in the movie, keep your money in your pocket. The fun-sinister liquid to pops n locks are COMPLETELY absent. Then again if you enjoy zumba or bouncing around like a yellow lab puppy, this would be a great workout for you.",1355961600,9,344,4.564516129032258
5310393,5,B009AVCA94,"I was really excited to try this out!! Mostly because I LOVED the movie & the choreography was awesome!!! I enjoy dancing a lot and have pretty good coordination, although I am far from being a professional. I'm latina and dancing is pretty much a requirement when it comes to being a part of the Latin Culture, so I knew I would be able to at least get the basic steps down. I had to pause and rewind some steps a few times, but if you keep going & do it often, you'll be a pro in no time! I love a challenge and enjoy learning new dance moves, so this DVD was perfect for me! I would recommend it to anyone who loves to dance no matter what your age may be :)",1354752000,21,661,3.9402985074626864
5310394,4,B009AVCA94,"OK...well...this video is for the dancer in you. Great moves if you love dancing. I really wish I could do it because it looks really cool.  Loved watching but I could not pick up the basic moves at all. Plus, I felt that they expect you to know a little something about dancing. They do give you some direction but than you move right in and this uncoordinated individual could never keep up with this.  Part 2, the Latin Groove which was 21 minutes was the only part I could come close to getting. It was fun and sexy and I could see how you could get into great shape by doing this every day.

If you are someone who gets discouraged when you can't get the moves don't bother but if you love dancing and want a challenge go for it. Great dance moves taken from the movie Step Up Revolution.",1354665600,33,793,4.203947368421052

5310417,5,B009AVCA94,"I have completed 3 of the 4 workouts so far and love every single one of them. This dvd teaches you how to dance. They moves are not dancy aerobic moves --- they are legitimate dance moves. I pick a workout and do it 3 times and I'm pretty sweaty by the time I'm done. They are so much fun that I LIKE doing them over and over. I even find myself doing some of the moves at work (when noone is looking).

The moves seem a little complicated at first if you're a beginner with little to no dance experience (like myself) but the instructors are great at really breaking each one down to their basics. Each time you learn a new move, they start from the top, adding it on to the sequence. This way, you're slowly building the routine. After you do a routine 2 or 3 times, you will grasp the entire thing.

Some reviewers complain you don't get much of a workout because of all the talking they instructors do. While there is talking, the dance moves themselves are pretty fast-paced and intense so I find that compensates for the lapses in activity. I think of the dancing parts as sprints and that's good for the body. However, I don't simply stand there while they are talking. I move throughout the entire workout, usually marching while the instructors are talking or mimicing the instructors.

I can't say enough good things about this DVD. I just love it so much and am so happy I bought it.",1459900800,,1395,4.337164750957855

5310439,5,B009AVCA94,"I am absolutely loving this DVD. I have no dance experience and found it difficult to keep up at first, but 3 weeks in using it almost every day, I'm getting there. I love it because it's fun! Even if you aren't hitting every move every time exactly right, you will still sweat, you will still get your heart going, and the more you do it, the better you get and the more fun it is. I also love that there are 4 separate routines, each roughly 20 minutes (they range 18-24), so I can find time to squeeze in at least one routine most days, and, more often, 2 or 3. The DVD also has an option where you can set it to play the routines in the order of your choosing so you don't have to monkey with it between routines. It's fun, it keeps me mentally engaged trying to learn it, and you're so busy dancing you don't notice you're actually getting a solid workout (until after, when you feel it). In 3 weeks I've lost inches off my waist, hips, thighs, arms, calves, and even my face looks smaller. Highly highly recommend. If you are a beginner, like me, you have to be willing to look a little dumb until you figure it out, but smiling helps you breathe, so just roll with it! I also love that it doesn't require any extra equipment at all and not much space.",1423958400,2,1258,4.159836065573771
5310440,4,B009AVCA94,Very fast paced. I wouldnt order if you do not have prior dance experiance. Great for someone who wants to learn something new that has dance training.,1422144000,,151,4.62962962962963

5310458,4,B009AVCA94,"Great way to get in shape! This video teaches four short dance routines step by step and then you do them to songs from the Step Up soundtrack. If you have mastered and enjoy Zumba this is for you. This video pushes your mind as well as your body. I found that I enjoyed it so much more than a standard ab work out with sit ups because you have to quickly remember the order of the steps and put them together. You definitely won't find this boring. This video pushes your memory. Some dance experience is expected and helps. After you master this video combine with Step Up Revolution Hip-Hop Cardio Burn, which I found to be slightly more intense and difficult. I wish they made more of these!",1411430400,,695,4.3538461538461535

5310461,4,B009AVCA94,"I would like to preface by saying that while I do not consider myself a dancer, I do have some basic dance knowledge (i.e. I've done swing dancing and country social dance).  This is a fun work out to bring out your inner dancer--and there are a lot of moves so you don't get bored.  I think for a person like me who has a little dance ability, you should be able to pick this up fast enough to enjoy yourself.  However, there is a learning curve.  They move fast on the video--I found my self going back and doing re-watching parts over and over till I got the moves right.  If you have never danced before, this will probably zoom over your head.  Those who have zero dance experience may want to start with something a little simpler.",1410566400,,737,4.266187050359712

If you like Zumba...you will like this Step Up Dance Workout video.  It is similar to Zumba except with more hip hop moves and not latin moves.  So you will definitely get a good workout.  The only annoying thing that I will say about this video is that the entire video seems like there is only 1 dance routine but they keep teaching it to you over and over and over and over again but with different background music.  So its like a one dance move fits all types of music thing.

I recommend the PussyCat Dolls Workout by Robin Bentin.  I just LOVE it.  There are 2 dvds.  both similar vibes and moves but they are different and you actually learn to dance like the PussyCat Dolls girls and you dance to their songs.  So much fun!  you won't even feel like you are working out but you'll be sweating like crazy!!!  Robin should really make more workout dvds...I would buy it all.",1409788800,22,995,4.3478260869565215

5310482,2,B009AVCA94,"It wasn't what I expected. I was looking more for a Zumba type workout, or even cardio hip hop. This was just kitschy dance routines meant for teeny boppers. So, if you're 10 and looking for a fun workout, this is for you!",1405036800,,222,4.186046511627907
5310483,1,B009AVCA94,"I did not like this workout at all. The idea is good but the setup is very awkward and incredibly repetitive. I guess this is good for people that have zero dance background, but if you know the basic steps for any type of dance it could be boring. Maybe this works better in the DVD version where you can hopefully skip the lessons and get straight to the dances. It doesn't work too well as a workout because is extremely long (about 1:30hrs) and you don't actually get to dancing until almost the 1/2 mark.",1404691200,,509,4.3125

5310497,5,B009AVCA94,"I loved the choreos, with this DVD you really dance to get fit. And to really get the dance combos in your body you need to do them twice or more. And because you will be tired (and satisfied) after two of the four combos, you will use the dvd with 4 combos quite a lot in comparison to other (dance) work out DVDs. Definitely a good buy if you love to dance and follow dance classes.",1403136000,3,384,4.0

Some of the moves are complicated, but probably could be mastered if you repeated the workout often.  You will need some room to move around wherever you are practicing this.  It has a nice variety.  I didn't find any of the moves hurt me, though I must add that I only did half of the tape before I tired out.

5310557,3,B009AVCA94,"The dances moves are definitely ""Step Up"" inspired as the description states, but unfortunately, the whole video did not cause me to even break a sweat which is very disappointing to me in a workout.

The moves were not too difficult to follow if you like dancing in general but if you are one with ""two left feet,"" you may have some difficulty",1389052800,,344,4.4603174603174605

5310576,5,B009AVCA94,"I was doing Blogilates for the longest time and I got super bored with it. I've been trying to find a fun workout to do everyday. I had been doing the So You Think You Can Dance cardio workouts and I loved them! So I decided that I'm going to buy a bunch of dance workout DVDs so that my workouts can be fun! I danced for 15 years and I miss it so much!

The Step Up Revolution dance workout DVD is exactly what I was looking for. The other dance workouts I had done were fun but not challenging. That is something I would note about this workout. It is a bit challenging, especially if you have no dance experience. BUT, if you have never danced before, this can still work for you. You can always rewind and catch yourself up. I actually did each workout routine twice, just to elongate my workout.

The routines are fun and that's what I love about them! Other workouts are so boring and that's why people stop them. With this workout, you can do it like once a week and mix it up with doing the other dance workout DVDs the other days of the week and you'll never want to stop exercising!

I LOVE this and would definitely recommend it!",1379548800,3,1140,4.172727272727273
5310577,2,B009AVCA94,This workout DVD is cheesy & not even a lot of fun. It's nothing like the movie moves & definitely not something I could watch/work out to every day. Too bad...,1378857600,2,160,4.193548387096774
5310578,3,B009AVCA94,When I bought this DVD I expected more of a cardio workout but this is mainly for people who want to learn cool dance moves. I have had no formal training when it comes to dancing so others may find it much easier than me but at first I had a lot of trouble getting the moves and keeping up with the routine but after a week of sticking with it I found myself learning the whole routine. It does take time for you to learn the moves but it is fun in the long run. I would not recommend this DVD if you are looking for a real strong workout but if you like to dance and aren't opposed to taking time to learn a  difficult routine this is for you.,1370649600,,645,3.8863636363636362

5310580,4,B009AVCA94,"Just wish that they would have a section for all completed moves so that you can do the routine without having to sit through the step-by-step instructions each time.

Once the dances are learned no longer need the instruction so there should be one section intitled: Full routine.",1364256000,,281,4.854166666666667

5310583,4,B009AVCA94,"This workout is all cardio.  The instructors break down each routine and repeat each new step quite a few times to make sure you're ready to move on (which was appreciated when I first started!).  There are four workouts and each are fun.  There are a few hiccups - the female instructor forgets to show a move correctly and has to re-teach it (not a huge deal) and when starting a routine the music stops and they have to wait for it.  Again, not big things but easily edited out.  I'm unsure why they left them in?

Anyway, if you like to dance you'll like this!  The routines are not incredibly difficult.  You won't be ready to appear in Step Up 5 or anything but you'll have fun and sweat!",1361404800,2,694,4.2846153846153845

8538795,2,B009AVCA94,"I honestly sort of hate this stupid DVD. My boyfriend and I have deduced that it's ONLY popular -- um, with a certain demographic -- due to riding the success of the movies. THE PROMO CLIP MAKES THIS DVD LOOK *FAR* MORE WELL PUT TOGETHER THAN IT IS.

The instructors are THE worst.

They literally never teach you the moves ON BEAT. If you have any rhythym, how are you supposed to learn new moves that go against the music...? I would like it if they did the moves to a HALF-TIME beat a couple of times, then sped it up to the actual beat. Much easier to learn that way.

Their cue counts are also off. Sometimes it's 5, 6 7, 8!"" and others it's ""5... 6... 5, 6, 7, 8!"" Completely discombobulating.

The production is THE worst.

Once, the woman instructor was teaching the wrong move (a move from another one of the included dance routines). Instead of editing that out, they risked confusing us more by keeping it. Ugh, what a waste. As if our brains weren't already focused enough trying to make our bodies do unnatural moves.

The choreography is THE worst... in what I think is the Hip Hop Jam workout (the one at the top left of the DVD menu).

This is hard to explain, but for instance, if you're completing the previous move you've learned and you've just used your right foot to move to the right, instead of now using the other foot to start the next move to go to the left, they'd have you do a mini-stomp with the right foot first. So it's like, Left, Right, Left, Right-Right, Left... which is extremely unnatural and disconcerting.

They also DO NOT always tell you what your feet are supposed to be doing. This is more the dude instructor. He's always teaching some ol' smooth-looking moves, with fancy (FAST) footwork, and again not describing all the little steps well.

Granted, this review is from a person with NO PRIOR DANCE EXPERIENCE. I'm fairly coordinated -- so much more so after doing intermediate to advanced Cathe Friedrich step routines for years, which are extremely brain-bending and dancy in spots, when you're new to it especially. But this Hip Hop Jam is going to take me several more times to get ALL the moves to be able to flow through it easily.

When it comes down to it, that in and of itself isn't a horrible thing. If it's too easy, you're bored with it after the first few times. So it gives you something to work toward. HOWEVER, this is a little challenging because the choreography, instruction, and production are so very poor, NOT because the dance routine itself is necessarily challenging.

So far, I've done 2 of the 4 workouts. The Hip Hop isn't heinously bad and is much easier to pick up, and it's actually fun to do. But the crappy instruction, production, etc., and TOTALLY ANNOYING female instructor nearly cancel out the benefit of it.

I'm so done wasting my time saying more about this crazy DVD. I'll update once I've done the final two routines to tell you if they're any better.",1488499200,,2943,4.50093808630394
