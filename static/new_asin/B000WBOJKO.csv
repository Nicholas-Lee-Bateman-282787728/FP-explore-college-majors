8222119,4,B000WBOJKO,"A brief but fascinating history of Lustron Homes, a unique and perhaps very useful idea in home-building.  These homes were constructed out of porcelain-coated stamped metal (think of a steel bathtub), thus providing a nearly impervious finish inside and out.  Even the roofs were of the same material.  For a brief time, it looked like they might be the next big thing.  Then the company was undone by dirty politics.  Recommended for anyone interested in American history and/or architecture.",1510272000,,494,5.2025316455696204
8222120,5,B000WBOJKO,"This DVD is very  informative and is a must have.  We had a Lustron here in Columbia, Missouri.  Sadly I was not interested in lessons at the time or I would have tried to go visit the home.",1465862400,,190,3.9473684210526314
8222121,5,B000WBOJKO,This is a brilliant documentary. It has to be one of the best I've ever seen. I was fortunate to get to visit the Lustron home at the Ohio Historical Society.. It was totally decked out with all the furniture and accessories of the period. Well worth a visit regardless how far you must travel...,1441670400,,296,4.4

And Lustron Homes were a real one-of-a-kind innovation, championed by a real one-of-a-kind American hero and entrepreneur, Carl Strandland. I've been researching Lustrons for years (and have read THE book too), but I've never seen as many rare, high-quality photos and films as I saw in this wonderful documentary.

Lustron Homes were made of 20-gage steel, with a porcelain enamel coating (just like a high dollar washing machine), and they were designed to be maintenance-free homes. Surprisingly, 50+ years later, that bold claim has proven true.

There were about 2,500 Lustrons sold in this country and the largest collection was (sadly, WAS) Quantico, Virginia which had 60 Lustrons but they were torn down a few years ago (which is horrific). Why they were not salvaged is a real mystery.

The end of this documentary was almost too horrible to watch. It was dirty, low-down politics that destroyed Lustron, effected by the slimiest, dirtiest creature America has ever produced: money-loving, corrupt politicians and their ilk. Strandlund lost his funding and had to close a plant and an amazing enterprise that he'd spent $50 million creating.

A few years later, Strandlund died a broken man, the light gone from his eyes, and the hope quashed in his heart. Those who knew him said he was never the same again.

The politicians who had conspired to kill Lustron and destroy Strandlund were eventurally indicted and a few ended up in jail. But it was too little too late. American politics had driven a wooden stake through the heart of Strandlund's brilliant dream: ""Lustron.""

If you love old houses, you'll want to watch Lustron again and again. You might want to skip the ending though on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th viewings. If you're like me, it'll set your hair on fire.",1398816000,5,1866,4.867507886435331
