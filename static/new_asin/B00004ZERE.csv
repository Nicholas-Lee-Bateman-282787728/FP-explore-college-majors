7928647,4,B00004ZERE,"This DVD contains four episodes of the Showtime series The Hunger.  Each episode is complete unto itself and introduced by David Bowie.  Each of these episodes works on the theme of obsession.  The main picture on the cover is from an episode not on the disk.
First we have a generation spanning tale of an aunt and a niece and a curious bottle said to contain a genie and the obsessions owning it can lead to.
Next we find a young executive with a pretty wife.  He becomes obsessed with an erotic web site.  His obsession quickly grows out of bounds.
In the third segment, a writer has slept with one of her fans only to find out that he was obsessed with her and practices black magic (with his mother's consent, no less).
Finally, a mild woman tries to take after a wilder friend.  At an erotic club she becomes obsessed with a lap dancer and the new experiences she can bring, no matter how painful.
A nice collection of episodes and only the screw top on the bottle bothered me (as anachronisms often do).  As this is a Showtime show, there is plenty of nudity and sex thus making this unsuitable for some viewers.",1069718400,10,1119,4.402912621359223
