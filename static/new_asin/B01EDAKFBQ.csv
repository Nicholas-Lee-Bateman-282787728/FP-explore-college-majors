8758346,4,B01EDAKFBQ,"This is the story of two families whose past have dictated their futures. First off we meet brother and sister Sebastian and Sophie who are orphans and have a special power or curse depending on ones take. They just want to be normal and decide they have to find out who they really are.

With scant clues and very little to go on they end up at a boarding school run by the Just family. But this place has a past too and it is a dark one. The kids enrol and set about doing all they can to discover the secrets hidden in the walls and the hearts of those that are there and those that have gone before.

Now this is a young adult type of production along the lines of Twilight, but these are not vamps so if that is your bag then this may not be what you want. It is original in places and then runs into clichs in others and the ending may be not to everyones liking. However, if you want an entertaining eight part young adult drama and like a bit of supernatural goings on and a touch of hanky panky then this should fit the bill.",1464739200,,1034,4.0390243902439025
