5021434,5,B006VUYJ0A,"My 3-y/o grandson loves Scooby Doo.  Yes, there are monsters in every show.  But, the monster is always defeated and turns out not to be real.  The 60s and early 70's were great for cartoons.  Don't have to worry about content.  I highly recommend",1359763200,2,247,4.5227272727272725

5021436,2,B006VUYJ0A,"I was unaware that this DVD contains old Scooby-doo episodes from the 1970s original series, Scooby-doo where are you?. As I already have that series, it was a waste of time buying this, it is just a re-release with new cover art. Next time I will wait for someone to list the episode titles so I know what I'm buying. The episodes are good, of course, but it is much cheaper to buy them as part of the complete series. Ok if you have no desire to own much Scooby or just something to keep the kids quiet..but in saying that this material is quite old,and won't keep older kids amused for long, unless they like the show.",1354838400,8,621,4.271186440677966
