WOWSERS!!!  I thought it was a great idea to sell series in the 2-pack and at a reasonal price. i'm a newbie fan to Korean dramas, but I was already familiar with some of the actors in someday (work them eyes Bae Doo-Na and hotness himself Kim Min Joon).  it has it's ordinary kdrama formula, rich boy meets poor girl, girl falls for poor boy, rich girl wants rich guy, scandal, scandal, scandal, someone gets left out. but I have to say, the richness of the characters and the someone often reasonable twists and turns is what makes this one, not so ordinary.  i now have two new crushes; Lee Jin Wook= hot and a fabulous actor and Oh Yoon Ah = absolutely beautiful and an amazing actress.  sometimes, when Korean isn't your first language, some things can get lost in translation.  the entire cast are natural actors, natural at drawing you in and natural and making you believe that you are part of the story instead of just looking from the outside.  i love how they incorporated the still art sketches. it was beautifully done.  in the end...i was left wanting more.",1360195200,,1242,4.416666666666667

8430810,5,B004ILXS92,"I love the drama.  Have seen it at least 3 times.  However, as I don't speak or understand Korean, the subtitles are very difficult to read at times.  The white lettering does not always show up well against the background and the font also seems to change.  Also, the music lyrics were not translated on screen as in the TV presentation.  I also think they may a good selection in the actors.  They were believable in their roles.  I love having the CD's to see when ever I want at home or on lunch break at work.",1315612800,,514,4.237113402061856
