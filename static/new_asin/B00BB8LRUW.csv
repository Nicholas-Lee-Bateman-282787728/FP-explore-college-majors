5569186,5,B00BB8LRUW,"Mike the Knight....
is a colorful little series about an adventurous little boy!
Mike tries to follow in his father's footsteps and pulls his two dragon friends into his little adventures.  Mike's little sister, Evie, wants to always tag along.  The funny little rascal put a spell on Mike's sword that every time he pulls it out of its case it becomes a brush a candle or some other tool that does end up helping with his adventure.  Sharing and caring are two of many other values Mike will teach our young.  I have to honest, it took a while for us older folks to get used to Mike the Knight, since it was our first encounter with him.  But my little boy found himself asking for more.  He is 1.5 yrs old, I recommend Mike the Knight for the younger audience.",1371600000,,762,4.330985915492958
5569187,5,B00BB8LRUW,"We received another great opportunity from NCircle Entertainment to review a complimentary copy of ""Mike the Knight: Knight in Training"" as members of their NSider program. Mike the knight is a new animated series (aimed towards preschool aged children) set in medieval times about a 10 year old boy who wants to be brave like his father, but he is still a knight in training. Mike is an adorable character, who's motto is ""Be a Knight, do it right"". Mike is accompanied by many friends including his best friend a horse, a couple of fun dragons, his little sister Evie who is a wizard in training and his mother Queen Martha. Children can follow Mike and friends on many fun fantasy filled adventures which encourage them to use their problem solving skills and imagination, while teaching lessons in responsibility, sharing, giving and understanding. This is the first time Mike the Knight has been released on DVD, and this DVD contains 5 episodes, and has a running time of approximately 56 minutes. Mike and friends are sure to please any little ones!",1371427200,,1056,4.8397790055248615
5569188,5,B00BB8LRUW,"Ncircle Entertainment does it again for my kiddo! We received the new Mike the Knight DVD last week- and my Daughter has fallen in LOVE with this series. Mom and Dad MAY be a little tired of hearing ""I want watch Mike the Knight"" in our house ;-) It is the movie she picks when it is ""movie time"" EVERY time! We do love the stories- and they teach great things to my little miss! From sharing with friends, to being a good neighbor, and working together- these stories teach classic life lessons in a fun and engaging way! She loves to quote Mike when he says ""It's time to be a knight and do it right""- it is absolutely adorable. We will be on the lookout for more Mike DVD's- she can't get enough!",1371081600,,699,4.185185185185185
5569189,5,B00BB8LRUW,"This is a really cute video and my kids adored it!  Now they are pretending to be Knights.  It has great characters and is good for a wide age range!
I received this video free-thank NCirlce",1371081600,,190,4.25
5569190,5,B00BB8LRUW,"My children love this DVD and I love the lessons that it teaches them.  Mike the Knight in Training has five stories on one DVD. Mike the Knight want to be a true Knight like his father but in his quest to be a knight he forgets to think about how his behavior may be hurting others.  Fortunatley, Mike the Knight always learns from his mistakes and corrects his bad behavior.  This DVD teaches children to think about how their actions and behaviors can affect other people.",1370390400,,475,4.436781609195402
5569191,5,B00BB8LRUW,"Reed is obsessed with this show and since it only comes on TV once a day, I was thrilled to receive Mike the Knight: Knight in Training to review. Now he can watch it anytime he wants - YAY!

Mike the Knight is a fun character with a charming personality and chivalrous spirit. His infamous statement is ""I'm Mike the Knight and my mission is to do it right."" Welllll things don't always go so right for Mike! But the thing that I love about him and always encourage my kids with is that he does his very best no matter what and always makes things right.

This show is the perfect age for my three and five year olds as is delves into subjects in their own lives. They loved the Trollee's Sleepover episode because that is something they have just recently started experiencing.

Kids love the characters and stories and moms love the lessons that are always being taught on every episode. NCircle is particularly great in the area of pleasing kids and moms and so I always appreciate a new release from them and know I don't have to pre-screen it alone first. We just sit down together and enjoy.

Mike the Knight: Knight in Training is equally enjoyable for boys and girls and mom might even find herself enjoying a giggle or two!",1370217600,,1233,4.418502202643172
5569192,5,B00BB8LRUW,"Another great NCircle Product!! My boys, aged 4 and 2 1/2, loved this DVD. It runs just short of an hour and the adventures that Mike has with his friends held their attention as well as taught them a few valuable lessons along the way. The bonus features were also very enjoyable, like the game and music.

I think EVIE'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT was their favorite episode out of the five stories included. This would make a great addition to any preschooler's collection and I highly recommend it. :)

5569197,5,B00BB8LRUW,"My son is almost 3 and is obsessed with this show.  He would watch it non-stop if I would let him.  We also got the Mike the Knight and Galahad the horse toy and he plays with them all day.  Got him a sword, shield and armor at the Dollar Tree and he wears it all day saying ""Be a knight and do it right!""  These stories all have a good message about not acting selfish and making choices that will be for the good of everyone.",1391472000,2,427,3.8735632183908044

5569200,5,B00BB8LRUW,"This is absolutely another winner with my kids. The lessons are easy to understand and relatable. But my four year old really started questioning more of the atmosphere and setting of the show. ""what's a princess, queen, knight, dragon, etc.""  He's seen these things on other shows but this video struck a chord with him. ""Where are the cars and phones."" So we've been getting books and looking online to answer his questions. (Cause I don't always know how to answer him!) so this was definitely an unexpected outcome from watching this movie. But thank you NCircle for the opportunity to again LOVE something we never expected!!",1373241600,2,630,4.88785046728972
5569201,5,B00BB8LRUW,"Be a Knight, Do It Right!

My son is pretty picky about what he watches, that is why I am so glad that he enjoys Mike The Knight episodes. He's watched the DVD so many times, that he can sing the theme song from heart.

Unlike some cartoons, what I love about this series is that each episode teaches children various life lessons.

For example, this dvd ""Knight in Training"". Has 5 episodes:

Scary Dragons (a lesson about not favoring one friend over another).

Evie's Birthday Present (Mike is trying to get Evie the best birthday present. Evie wants to join his mission, but he doesn't want her to come because the gift is a surprise. In the end, he learns that letting her do what she wants to do is the best birthday present of all).

Fluttering Favour (Learning that being slow and careful is more important than being speedy and careless).

Trollee's Sleepover (Learns that it is important to treat guests special).

Highly recommended!

I received this video free....Thank NCirlce",1372291200,2,989,4.703488372093023
5569202,5,B00BB8LRUW,"As an NCircle NSider I got a copy of Mike The Knight  - Knight In Training DVD to review.  This DVD runs 56 minutes and has 5 episodes; Scary Dragons, Evie's Birthday Present,  Fluttering Favor, Trollee's Sleepover  and Mission Home. There are a few bonus features; Glendragon Matching Game, Meeting Mike's Friends and Mike The Knight Theme Song.
For those of you who have never seen the show I'll give you a quick rundown. Mike is a young boy who is a knight in training; he wants to be a great knight just like his father. So in every episode he takes on a task, usually at first he doesn't get it right. But with the help from his sister Evie, who is doing some training of her own to become a wizard, and his two best friends... who just happen to be dragons, he finally gets it right. He has a cute motto of ""Be A Knight And Do It Right"".
Each episode is not only entertaining but they all teach some good life lessons. The characters are lovable and vivid. Now even though the show is set in Medieval Times there is no violence involved. When Mike draws his sword he doesn't get a sword, thanks to one of Evie's spells going wrong. There is no slaying of dragons or hunting trolls and witches or anything like that. So you don't have to worry about your little one going after the cat or dog to slay it. Nor do you have to worry about it encouraging any hitting.  Right now my son is going through a Mine Phase and I love that Mike shares and works well with others.
I can't even begin to tell you how many times we have watched the DVD now.  We watched it as soon it arrived and even the week when we were away it was one of the movies that just had to go with us. My son (he will be 2 in July)  really enjoys watching it. The show is cute and easy to follow; I'd say it's great for little kids up till about 5 or 6 years old.  We can't wait for another DVD to come, would be great if it was the whole first season... hint hint NCircle.",1371772800,10,1943,4.081364829396326
