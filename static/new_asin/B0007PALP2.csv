2229577,4,B0007PALP2,"Not the typical WW2 spif.  Plot is familiar with new Cmdr. trying to fit in and win the loyalty of his men.  Enough action to keep the movie interesting.

2229578,5,B0007PALP2,"To those of us who share the collective title of ""boomers"" (not to be confused with certain nuclear submarine types) , there are certain movies out there in the DVD marketplace now that bring back fond memories. In the early 1960s, television was coming out of a period when most of what was shown..movie-wise...were cinematic studio ""oldies"" shown on local ""late shows"". ""early shows"", ""shock theatres"", etc. This is where we got introductions to Crosby & Hope, Karloff, Lugosi, King Kong, the Duke, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, the ""Three Mesquiteers"", Errol Flynn, and many others.

  As these new 60s got underway, though, something new and exciting began on the NBC network. The Peacock crowd (with their new toy , color television) cranked up a new tv show...""Saturday Night At the Movies""...shown every Saturday night (natch)at 9:00 p.m. EST (or DST in summer).  Verbally hosted by Donald Rickles (NOT to be confused with comedian DON Rickles), ""Saturday Night At The Movies"" was a special arrangement between NBC and 20th Century Fox Film Corporation to show recent quality movie releases (10 years old or less)...many in  (surprise) Color!...on prime time each week.

  This show quickly became a solid hit and inspired many imitators (ABC launched a ""Sunday Night Movie""  shortly thereafter in a deal with United Artists). On Saturday night one now got a dose of more recent cinematic fare (and much better image quality) than we'd been previously used to. And, oh, what we got to see!!!! ""Titanic"" (Webb & Stanwycke), ""THe Seven Year Itch"" (Monroe & Ewell), ""Niagra"" (Monroe),

The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (Rennie & Neal""), ""No Highway In the Sky"" (James Stewart), ""Prince Valiant"" (Wagner), ""The Hunters"" (Mitchum, Egan, & Wagner), ""The Enemy Below"" (Mitchum & Jurgens), and on and on: ""The Desert Fox"", ""The Desert Rats"", ""Cheaper By the Dozen"", ""How To Marry A Millionaire"",

""Halls of Montezuma"", ""Beneath the 12-Mile Reef"". ""Red Skies of Montana"", etc.

  And, among these, ""The Frogmen"".

  And seeing it again has been a treat, because it is a wonderful movie. Reminds one of how good they USED to make them (before they were ""gimmicked up"" to be on-screen video games for

no-brain adolescents). There is action and excitement a'plenty here, along with a good BELIEVABLE story (how rare is THAT nowadays? ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith""???) and some GREAT acting performances....Richard Widmark and Dana Andrews in particular.

  Widmark (the original ""edgy"" actor....LONG before Nick Cage) turns in yet another of his fabulous performances as the new CO of UDT Team 4 in the South Pacific, late in the war. As usual Widmark operates on all acting cylinders here...he works with vocal timing and perfect dialog delivery, dead-on body language and mannerisms, and couldn't-be-better eyework...proof once again that this great star-yet-not-a-superstar was one of Hollywood's hands-down best actors (Check out ""Halls of Montezuma"" or ""Madigan"", among other roles). Widmark does not play a cardboard hero here. He is a man plagued with flaws and doubts...yet a good, brave man. Just a complicated one.

  And, good as Widmark's performance is, Dana Andrews stands up to equal it as Widmark's nemesis. Andrews plays a Chief Petty Officer in Team 4 who is like oil to Widmark's water, and who, with dogged resentment to Widmark's ""taking the place"" of Team 4's lately-killed former commander, won't ""cut the new guy any slack"" and keeps resentment stirred up against Widmark by all the enlisted team members.  The war of acceptance or non-aceptance between the new C.O. and ""the guys"" lies at the heart of the movie. And this is a ""war"" well played throughout.

  Jeffrey Hunter privides strong backup here. as does Gary Merrill (Captain of the UDT mission ship), and a group of good character actors (some, like Jack Warden and a couple of others, who would become much more high profile later on).

  Biggest mystery about ""The Frogmen"" concerns Robert Wagner.

He is always listed as ""being there"", and is named PROMINENTLY in the the credits....yet he is barely there at all! He cannot have any more than 45 seconds screen time...if THAT!!! He seems to play a junior bridge officer (when seen) named ""Ensign Franklin"", who, recognizable AS a young Robert Wagner as he stands in proximity to Gary Merrill in two long shots of the bridge, does NOTHING but stand there. On one other scene, for about a 5-second run (tops...if THAT) he is called on by Merril to ""Mr. Franklin, lower a boat"". To which order Wagner delivers (near as I can tell), his only three lines in the movie: ""Aye aye, sir!"".

  That little peculiarity apart, everything else about this film works. Co-operation by the Navy helped produce a ""ton"" of informative UDT action scenes: the viewer is shown the operations of the departure and pick-up boats, the sling-catching of the frogmen that retrieves them out the water into a rubber raft attached to the pick-up boat...actual scouting of beach traps and the mining of same with stachel demo charges...the planting of a ""Welcome to the Beach"" sign as a rag on the marines (based on a real WWII practice)...and a full scale harbor penetration in dry suits and scuba at the film's end to blow up Japanese submarine pens. The producers (and Navy)

""fudge"" this a little bit by having the team go in wearing 1950s era aqualungs, regulators, and hoses (rather than the real WWII style rebreathers they would really have used), but this might have been done for some security reason (hard to tell). No matter, the scenes work. That's what really counts.

  All ends well here...just the way you want it to. All team conflicts aren't shown to have been ""ironed out"" completely, but enough evidence is there to show that a corner has been turned in team relations with UDT 4 to suggest the old guys and the new guy might just be headed for some hard-won mutual acceptance after all.

  Again, good movie. Well worth watching and in glorious black and white .

  With this out, and ""Halls of Montezuma"" (another Widmark winner), makes you hope Fox puts out ""Red Skies of Montana"", the most exciting smoke jumper/forest fire movie ever put to film. Also wouldn't hurt to see the OTHER big FROGMAN movie either: Dan Dailey as the ""Underwater Warrior"".",1119052800,58,6259,4.941682600382409

2229627,4,B0007PALP2,"The Frogmen, 1951 film

It begins with sailors on a ship discussing a portrait. They are part of an elite team, and there is conflict with regular sailors. UDT men are told to behave, or else. They are part of an operation to invade a Japanese-held island and will create a diversion. Rubber rafts are launched, the UDT men enter a motor boat that will take them to the beach. They put on face masks and rubber fins. [No wetsuits to hold body temperature? Dark-colored wool long underwear could work here.] Their job is to remove obstacles that would damage landing boats. [No SCUBA gear?] They locate and document these obstacles. The enemy shoots at them when they reach the surface. Then they are brought aboard. A direct hit destroys one boat! The other continues to sea. I know that. They hold services for the dead.

Commander Lawrence is transported to another ship to report the facts. His leg was injured by coral poisoning, and he is told to rest for a few days. Some men asked for a transfer. Lawrence explains the reason for his decision. The next day the operation begins. Airplanes emit smoke to screen the invaders. The frogmen begin their underwater demolition by placing explosives on the obstacles. Demolition cords are linked to connect the bombs. Two UDT men post an unauthorized sign, one is wounded when returning. They fall behind but are picked up on a return trip. Operation 18 completed. Bravery required brains to avoid risks (like planting that sign). Flanagan is told off; later the rest of the team asks for a transfer. A noise tells of a torpedo strike! It was a dud but pierced the side of the ship. One wounded man is trapped below.

Can they disarm the torpedo with a screwdriver? A wooden tongue depressor will prevent the firing pin from working. They see a submarine surface, it has sealed orders for Commander Lawrence and ten men. The sub is not allowed to run on the surface during daylight hours. Their mission is to attack a Jap submarine pen. They are launched at night, with dark wet suits and SCUBA gear. [How can they see underwater?] The Japanese see a warning light go on. They respond by sending their own Frogmen to attack the invaders, who defend themselves. Lawrence is wounded, he orders the others to return to the submarine. The wounded are put into sick bay. His men accept Commander Lawrence now.

This is more of an educational movie with action. It discusses the interpersonal dynamics of a small elite team when their leader is replaced. It shows the actions of an Underwater Demolition Team, called frogmen because of their footwear. These forces were later turned into SEALs with a more varied function for modern times. Unlike some other movies from this era, there is little about the mens personal lives or romances.",1474243200,,2781,4.727835051546392

Brando and Brenner were superb as was the character that played 'Kruser', Martin Benrath. Also notable were Hans Christian Blech and Janet Margolin as a Jewish/American/German/expatriate. The premise is believable, accurate for the time and full of intrigue.  Some of the subject matter was touchy for sensors and probably why I never saw it on Saturday afternoon TV as a kid.  Rape, nudity (in a picture), antisemitism, and the Nazi hate issues of the German crew. Wally Cox played a heroin addict and was quite convincing.  That would have been another issue verboten on TV in the 50's and 60's.
All in all the drama, cinematography, plot and boat scenes were splendid.  It was an all-around good movie and we'll sit down to it again.
Sink the Bismarck never disappoints.  The historical twist of one single torpedo turns the German boat around and then it's history.  The model boats scenes are a testimony to the craftsmanship of early 60's British movies which led to Dr. Who, and other thrills.

The movie is about the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) or 'fromgmen'. They were the combat swimmers of WWII and Korea that would secretly enter planned landing areas to clear obstructions prior to any amphibian landings, or plant mines on high value naval targets. The Navy Seals are the direct descendants of the Navy Frogmen and owe much of what they are too them.
Having said all of this, I found this movie to be a little... slow. The acting was fine, and the action was excellent too... there just wasn't enough of it. Too much of the movie focuses on the difficult relationship of the 'new' C.O. (Richard Widmark) with the team. I wanted more action and less drama.",1401235200,,870,4.768211920529802

2229895,4,B0007PALP2,"This 4-DVD set offers 4 WWII movies whose naval-oriented subject matter is a bit off the beaten track.

""Sink the Bismarck!"" is probably the best known out of the quartet, and it features good acting all-around, a compelling story and a nice musical score. Having Edward R. Murrow appear as himself reading radio updates from London is a very nice touch, and adds a sense of truth to the proceedings. B&W but shot in Cinemascope.

""The Frogmen"" is a B&W movie I remember from my youth. A very young Richard Widmark has the lead role, with Dana Andrews and Jeffrey Hunter in secondary roles. It's the story of the Underwater Demolition Teams operating in the Pacific. This is a straight-forward action flick with little time spent on personality conflicts, outside of that between Widmark's character and the frogmen team - he's replacing their recently KIA leader. Aspect ratio is 4/3. Good stuff.

""The Enemy Below"" is the only color movie in this set. It's a compelling cat-n-mouse picture that toes a familiar line: my enemy is just as smart if not smarter than me. A US Destroyer chases a German U-boat across the South Atlantic. By the end of the movie, both ships are ablaze and both crews are rescued and united in a mutual respect, proving that the men sent to fight wars and the peoples at war often have very different takes on the nitty gritty of war.

I'm a bit embarrassed to report that I had never even heard of the Marlon Brando thriller ""Morituri."" In fact, this movie is the reason I purchased this set - I caught the movie about 1/4 of the way in on TMC last week and really liked the story and the telling. That inspired me to look for the film at amazon, and voila! here it is! Besides Brando's excellent portrayal of a German undercover agent working for the Brits to commandeer a shipment of rubber bound to Germany, the rest of the cast is top-drawer, including Wally Cox (aka the voice of the cartoon character ""Underdog""), who makes a rare acting appearance as a German doctor. Yul  Brenner plays the ship captain, and the German roles in the cast are filled out by a number of actors who always seem to crop up in war films from this era, among them, Martin Kosleck, Eric Braeden and Hans Christian Blech, not to mention George Takei in a very early film role.

There's really nothing in the way of extras on this discs outside of trailers.

I purchased this DVD set firm in my assumption that none of these films is going to be released on BluRay any time soon.

2229900,4,B0007PALP2,"This edition of the Heroes of War Collection subtitled Navy Battles is clearly targeted marketed and you should already know if this is your kind of movie collection. What I find typical of movie collections is the presence of one or two desirable items packaged with an equal number of turkeys. In this case the ratio is at least three good to one and that one is not that bad.

The set contains:
The Frogman; a fairly conventional propaganda piece of its period. The new skipper in this case played by Richard Widmark takes command of a Navy Underwater Demolition Team (one of the Navy's first ventures into Special Forces and parent group to today's SEALS). The basic plot concerns the new skipper earning the acceptance of his troops. One can see George Patton laughing at the entire concept. This is a relatively conventional war movie plot there is no real originality in the handling of the plot. The concept of Navy special forces was relatively new to the theater viewer and so this movie is something of a minor breakthrough. Much of the action footage has the look and feel of a training film but many viewers may still find the subject unique and therefore entertaining.

Sink the Bismarck; one of the most historically accurate war movies for at least another 10 years. The movie is based on the history of the search for and sinking of the Bismarck as written by C. S. Forester. To keep it from being all history and perhaps to help keep the non-war movie fan awake we are given Kenneth More as the shore based British Director of Operations and Dana Wynter, as the junior Navy officer (female)  who takes an interest in him. A more interesting dynamic is between Carl Mohner as Bismarck's commander Captain Lindemann and his superior Karel Stepanek as Admiral Lutjens. The captain is portrayed as a more cautious military officer somewhat less interested in becoming a member of Hitler's inner circle while his admiral is portrayed as a dedicated party man.

The Enemy Below; one of the all-time classics in any of the war movie genres. This movie pits Robert Mitchell as the commander of the World War II Navy destroyer escort attempting to intercept and hold down a German U-boat commanded by Kurt Juergens. Detailing why this is a truly great movie would take far longer than is suitable in this review. I delighted in how quickly the director was able to establish that the destroyer wardroom consisted of a mix of ""90 day wonders"" and over the hill call ups that its ex-merchant marine skipper (feather merchant) would likely to have been commanding in just this situation. The fact that Germans could be portrayed respectfully without pretending that their cause was somehow noble was another unusual achievement. Another small but eloquent moment is when the Germans skipper tosses his robe across a beam  ""coincidentally"" obscuring the word ""Fuhrer"" in the ship's motto ""Fuhrer Befiehl Wir Folgen""(The Fuhrer leads and we follow)"" establishing that he is not a party man.

Morituri, the title translates from the Roman gladiator salute meaning  ""we who are about to die"". I had not heard of this movie before. it could be one of the best espionage movies ever Marlon Brando plays an ex-patriot German forcibly recruited by the British to conduct a mission whose purpose is to keep a German cargo ship from scuttling itself. You may count for yourself how many different ways that one sentence makes this plot line atypical.  Yul Brynner plays the skipper of this ship. The complexities of his life would add several paragraphs to this discussion. In sum he is also a sympathetic character. It is unusual because both hero and villain are characters for whom the viewer can support. If the central struggle does not provide enough opportunities for plot twists there will be others including the unexpected arrival of not entirely sympathetic American civilian prisoners.

Altogether this is a very satisfying collection of war movies with at least a few features to make them interesting to more than just the war movie fan.",1388448000,21,4047,4.853623188405797

For the same money, you would be better off buying one of those cheap DVD war movie sets with 50 movies in it.  Richard Widmark is Richard Widmark but he can't be blamed for this cheap script production.  It wasn't his fault that a lame over simplistic story with virtually no technical support was exploited just to get something into the movie circuit.  Dana Andrews fails in his role as a Navy Chief; his nose is just too far up in the air to be believable.  Like asking a British butler to wait on tables in a hamburger joint.  Gary Merrill is supposed to be the ""Skipper"" but acts more like a support officer off duty.  We turned it off early in the movie as we could not watch any more of it.

2229969,3,B0007PALP2,"Produced in 1951, when USA and allies were engaged in a deadly fight against communist armies in Korea, this film is mostly war time propaganda, but it is indeed partly based on true stories and not half bad made.

Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) were a specialised, elite formation of US Navy combat swimmers. They were formed as a separate entity as the result or the incredibly difficult and bloody battle of Tarawa (November 1943). Even if this battle was ultimately won by the Americans, they suffered suffered extremely heavy losses, as the result of the poor knowledge of natural and artificial underwater obstacles protecting the approaches to the landing areas. Immediately after, American high command in Pacific ordered forming and training of the first UDTs, to first scout the approaches to the beaches of Japanese held islands and make maps of them - and then blast with explosives the most dangerous obstacles.

The first operation for the UDTs was the invasion of Kwajalein on 31 January 1944. After than, the UDTs participated in every major American operation in Pacific theater (they didn't fight in Europe), and they served also in Korea (1950-53) and in Vietnam - it was during that conflict that UDTs would be expanded and transformed and become US Navy SEALS...

This film tells the story of one of UDTs teams in the last months of Pacific War, although no specific dates are provided. We know everything happens after Iwo Jima, because the new leader of the team, Cmdr. Lawrence (Richard Widmark) replaces the previous commander who was killed in this battle. Lawrence is initially poorly received and because of his coldness and considerable bad luck his relations with all his subalterns will just go from bad to worse. He will especially clash with the senior NCO of the unit, Chief Flannigan (Dana Andrews), following an indident involving the most popular and fearless of all sailors from his unit, ""Pappy"" Creighton (Jeffrey Hunter).

The scenario is not extremely original and we can almost always anticipate what will happen in the next scene, and there is of course a ""standard issue"" ending, the only one conceivable for this kind of ""morale builders"" films. The final mission against a Japanese submarine base is absolutely fictional, but had to be added to make this film more dramatic.

But ""Frogmen"" is not without merits. The description of UDT operations is excellent and particularly interesting and some underwater sequences are really breathtaking, even today. The three main actors (Widmark, Andrews and Hunter) bravely seconded by less known Gary Merrill (who plays a very stoical and wise captain of the mother ship from which Lawrence's UDT operates) offer a pretty nice show. And some moments are pretty dramatic. Last but not least - many former US Navy SEALs, including some of the most famous, publicly admitted that they decided to become combat swimmers after watching this film in their early teens.

Bottom line, this is a honest little war movie about a little known aspect of Pacific War. Not very good, not very bad and recommended mostly to war films amateurs. Enjoy!",1360022400,7,3128,5.028957528957529

2230021,4,B0007PALP2,"A good producer's film, ""The Frogmen"" sails along at a steady clip.  Good acting, with limited exposure to individual talent.  Essentially, it is a sequence of vignettes, combined with action scenes.  A solid showcase for
the U.S. Navy, circa the early 1950s, it is a misleading portrayal of the
World War II era.  Introduced to the Teams in the late Forties, aqualungs
saw little use even in Korea.  Limited visability in mined harbors called
for free swimming, mostly.

Standard issue for late-World War II UDTs, M-26 life belts, the ""invasion
belts"" used widely at Normandy, are off the radar, here.  Appearing early
on in the story, coral shoes take a powder in a later scene depicting the
cast and recovery of swimmers, which is otherwise the most accurate thing
in the film.

The actual UDT 4 was not at Iwo Jima, where plunging surf was a challenge
for combat swimmers, unhindered by artificial obstacles.  Iwo entered the script, I suspect, to add a sense of off-screen drama, but primarily as a
means of establishing the time frame.

Actual West Coast UDT personnel add considerable visual authenticity.  It
is a fine tribute to their own professionalism.

2230022,4,B0007PALP2,"I was a Frogman in WW11 so it was easy to double Richard Widmark in this one. The picture is very close to accurate. The tanks used were different from what I had and the suits were somewhat different. However, this is in the Pacific and I was in Europe. Very good depiction of the real thing. I enjoyed working on ths picture and you will certainly enjoy watching it.",1277424000,,368,4.271428571428571
2230023,4,B0007PALP2,"The frogmen (the Underwater Demolitions Teams) depicted in this film were the WWII precursors to the modern Navy SEALS.  This was the reason to get the film, and it did not disappoint, with plenty of scenes depicting the frogmen at work.

As a film, The Frogmen is weak, but no more so than many WWII films of the same era.  Widmark plays a slightly more than 2-dimensional commanding officer, but the writers never give us a convincing reason for his team's change of heart and acceptance at the end of the film.  Corny devices like a torpedo that conveniently lodges in a hull with the arming device faced up are standard fair for films like this, I think.  No marks off.

As another reviewer mentioned, I would have appreciated something more from the special features.",1269993600,,772,4.681481481481481

2230025,4,B0007PALP2,Bought the series primarily for the Sink The Bismark Video.  It was great.  Have also watched The Enemy Below and it is very good.  Robert Mitchum is real good.  Have not watched the other two in the series.  The series was worth the price just for the two abovementioned videos.,1252800000,7,279,4.5
2230026,4,B0007PALP2,"This is a great black and white movie that dramatizes the beginnings of scuba as a weapon of war (WW2).  It is an older movie, where the story is carried by the script and direction rather than special effects.

2230028,4,B0007PALP2,"I had never heard of this movie until it popped up as an Amazon recommendation, and I read purchaser reviews of it.  I'm glad I was guided by those reviews.

It's a well written and well acted little movie about a WWII UDT team accustoming themselves to a new leader, who replaces a very popular leader who died in action.  Richard Widmark is great as the somewhat stiff and by the book new officer.  So too is Dana Andrews as the chief petty officer who will become the linch pin around the eventual acceptance of the new leader by the team.  In between, however, there is a lot of friction between them,

As an avid SCUBA diver, I found it interesting how primative and minimal the UDT teams equipment was.  The underwater photography was suprisingly well done for the time, although probably done in a back lot pool, as there was not a fish in sight.

If you like human drama as much as load explosions, give this one a try.",1213315200,,927,4.380116959064328
2230029,4,B0007PALP2,"Just goes to show that some little-known films are little gems, and this one is no exception.  Very enjoyable and educational.  Widmark, as usual, right on the mark, demonstrating that he could handle 'good guy' roles as well. Nice to see Gary Merrill again too.  Interesting that the Navy Frogmen operations and proceedures were given the okay to be shown to the wide public at that time.",1208563200,,389,4.776119402985074
2230030,3,B0007PALP2,"""Frogmen"" is a typical run of the mill color war movie from the 1950s !

With two of my favorite actors in Dana Andrew and Richard Widmark, it shows if the storyline is flat that even great actors cannot help it.
The guys don't like their new C.O. and then he does something brave and now they love him.
It is nice to see one of the few movies Jeffery Hunter made !

I think Widmarks and Andrews roles should have been switched.",1202601600,,428,4.144578313253012

Richard Widmark has never been one of my favorite actors (his best role in my opinion was Jim Bowie in The Alamo), I was a little skeptical of what I would find in The Frogmen.

The footage of the teams using the boat and swimming underwater were done by the actual UDT team 4, they also used them in other places in the movie.  During the scene where Richard Widmark is talking to the men while they are laying in their bunks my father can be easily seen in the top bunk to his right, other men in this scene were also members of UDT 4.",1158019200,,527,4.0
2230058,4,B0007PALP2,"A good story, well told. No fake, false heroics, no garbage: just straight down the line. It is therefore ten times more convincing and realistic than the Oscar-winning WWII twaddle being served up by Hollywood these days. This, one feels, is what war operations were truly like: efficient teams carrying out effective, well-disciplined, well-organised missions. The technology of frogman drill was particularly interesting. Those who imagine that WWII was about a bunch of morons wandering around in sunlit fields, looking for a lost sheep, are welcome to their fantasies. They are unfortunately unaware of the meaning of a good job, well done. Some casualties, but no tears.",1157068800,6,676,5.327102803738318
2230059,4,B0007PALP2,"The Frogmen maintained its focus on the men. It capture the attitude and the temper of the times. The action scenes tho dated by the movie technology of the times, still showed a peek into the real life dangers of the job of the UDT. The real UDT 4 did experience several of the missions incidents as portrayed by the movie. The real gem of this movie is a peek into the socialization of the ship's company interacting with dare devil, ""he-men"" of the UDT. The movie showed the importance of team as well as the respect the UDT had for each other, if you proved yourself. I'll watch again and again.",1155168000,3,599,4.357142857142857

This review is for the product I received from Amazon. If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"".  There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery mechanism.

When the DVD first starts to play you watch a video describing that it is wrong to copy a movie. The video depicts various types of theft with nasty heavy metal music.  This would be no different than if you sat down at a table in a restaurant and the waiter came up and lectured you in harsh terms, about the immorality of skipping out on the check and not paying.

The movie itself I enjoyed, 5 Stars.  Well acted, with plenty of action. Lots of underwater sequences.

8050143,5,B0007PALP2,"I love movies about commando raids and this one about the forerunners to the Navy Seals is a keeper! I really liked it. I love finding movies that show me something I've never seen before and this movie did just that; in particular, the scene where the guys are in the motorboat en route to their drop zone and each guy falls into the water at various intervals from a raft that is attached to the boat. That was really neat to see. Even more interesting was how they were each picked up at intervalsa thing of beauty! It reminded me of some sort of synchronized water sport. You just have to see it, it's so wild! A large majority of it was filmed right in the ocean which gave it some nice realism. Dana Andrews is great as usual. Richard Widmark was good too. His character is a good guya little hard-edged but still sympathetic. The only negative I could find was that the ending, which was really suspenseful, seemed to wrap up too quickly. I felt that it should have gone on a couple of minutes longer for maximum effect. But overall, a great little film. What a find!",1520553600,,1074,4.348258706467662
