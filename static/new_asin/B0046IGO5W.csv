8417332,5,B0046IGO5W,"For those of us who admire Rossini's sacred music, this mass is certainly worth having. The interpretation is very well achieved. Too bad that his Stabat Mater can't be found on DVD.",1414800000,,182,4.71875
8417333,5,B0046IGO5W,"I saw this performed on EWTN's ""Concert"" series and had to have it. It was hard to find and it took awhile to arrive but the video quality was a thousand times better than on TV. It's part of my collection now and won't be going anywhere.",1407456000,,238,4.085106382978723
8417334,5,B0046IGO5W,"Another sample of Rossini's genius!. I was surprised of this work different to others of the same composer. Orquestra, conductor and singers were really good.",1355875200,,158,5.36
8417335,5,B0046IGO5W,"Until now I had no idea that Rossini had orchestrated his Petite Messe Solennelle. I only have the 2 pianos & harmonium version on LP & CD.
Although I actually prefer the piano version, I am equally happy with the orchestral as well. When I saw the organ, I thought we were in for some big sounds from it, but unfortunately it was played like a harmonium.  So why bother using a pipe organ at all? My only quip.
The quartet of soloists are wonderful: There's:  Alexandrina Pendatchanska (soprano) I have her as queen Elizabeth I in Donizetti's Roberto Deveraux & she just blew me away with her singing & acting skills). The rest of the soloists I have never heard before this recording.
Manuela Custer (mezzo-soprano) Stefano Secco (tenor) Mirco Palazzi (bass) all exceptional.
The gewandhausorchester, Leipzig & the Leipzig Opera Chorus under Chailly bring this work home safely. A wonderful reading of a Rossini rare masterpiece.
Worth every cent & a must have for any serious music collector.",1309564800,,995,4.847058823529411
8417336,5,B0046IGO5W,"Rossini's Petite Messe Solennelle is rarely heard in today's concert halls, which is a pity, because this is great music in every respect. The instrumentation is spare, but brilliant, there are intimate as well as grandiose parts and many moving moments. Soloists, choir and orchestra are kept on their toes throughout the 80+-minutes work. If I ever heard an ideal interpretation of the Messe, this is it: Riccardo Chailly--visibly moved by the musical and spiritual event--and his Leipzig musicians, including the organist and, of course, the two choirs are superb. The four soloists, obviously familiar with Rossini's idiom and bel canto, are in glorious form. Audio (uncompressed: bravo EuroArts!) and video of the 2008 recording are exemplary. Don't miss this one.",1296086400,6,769,5.363636363636363
