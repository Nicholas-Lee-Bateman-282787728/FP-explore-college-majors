8522222,4,B007VHOI94,"MY TUTOR FRIEND 2 is a romantic comedy that balances delicately between romance and comedy. Director Ho Jung Kim presents a view of contemporary South Korea as an immigrant might have who wishes to blend in but runs into a variety of obstacles mostly linguistic that impede a successful acclimation. Junko (Lee Chung Ah) is a Korean-Japanese raised in Japan who speaks ungrammatical and flawed Korean. Her father decides to send her to Korea to study as an exchange student. Junko is optimistic and determined to assimilate and it is her earnest wish to do so that imbues the film with many funny scenes. At the core of the comedy lies a more serious note. She is in love with a fellow Korean whom she met in Korea but has recently returned to Korea. She knows his general whereabouts and is confident that they can re-ignite their long separated love.

From the moment she enters Korea, Junko collides with a Korean culture that envelops her in one humorous incident after another. Jong-Man (Park Ki Woong) is her romantic lead who true to form in Korean comedy takes an instant dislike to her that slowly morphs into a genuine attraction. His job is to tutor her in the nuances of Korean language. In one side-splitting scene, she has memorized a series of greetings that she recites to her classmates on her first day of school. These greetings are replete with sexual and scatological ribaldry that leaves her teacher and classmates slack-jawed with grossness mixed with joviality. A similar scene occurs later on when quite on her own unfamiliarity with the complexities of Korean slang, vocabulary, and syntax, she astonishes yet another teacher and class with unintended laughter. Scenes such as these ring a bell with any immigrant trying to communicate with natives and embarrassment inevitably results.

Since MY TUTOR FRIEND 2 is billed as a romantic comedy, there is some attempt to build some chemistry between the leads, but with mixed results. Except for a cute scene at the very end, they seem more like mismatched siblings than mismatched lovers. Jong-Man endures her presence far more than he seeks it out. When Junko finally meets her long lost Korean lover, Jong Man does little more than pout and whine, thus emphasizing his callowness. Her lover is far more mature and one can see how he might easily catch the feminine eye. There are various elements of seriousness undergirding the comedy. One of them is her quest for her lover. When she finally meets him, his interest in her is so faint that one can see how little she now means to him. He has no trouble accepting her realization that they have little in common and off he goes to find other willing women. A second somber note is Jong Man's desire to help a former boxing opponent whom he has crippled into a vegetative comatose state. When he steps into the ring for a match with a serious fighter, Jong Man sees only the face of his erstwhile opponent and cannot bring himself to fight hard, with sadly predictable results.

MY TUTOR FRIEND depends on the comedy of cultural assimilation problems for viewer involvement. No one seriously expects a lasting romance even if the closing scene of reconciliation suggests a forced happy ending. This is a funny movie that entertains even if the promised romance is mildly lacking. Recommended.",1406073600,,3319,4.829525483304042
8522223,4,B007VHOI94,"I liked this movie. The comedic acting is very good and the actors are attractive. Even the two ""sidekicks"" are funny, where this usually fails by western standards. The wrestling scene between the two sidekicks got guffaws out of me, even though the routines are certainly old; still funny.

Of course, being Korean, the plot makes no sense, but that's okay here.

Favorite line, as the male lead carries a totally drunken female lead on his back, up hill, bent over so far that his chest is parallel to the ground: ""This is it; this is how I die; this must be what an elephant weighs!"" Just struck me funny as he trudges on the brink of collapse up hill :)

An element of mystery is injected with no explanation whatever as to what is going on with our leading man. This was irritating, distracting, and I initially thought it was probably not necessary, in an attempt to add ""another dimension"" to our bratty, ratty male lead. But I was wrong. There is a significant plot point to the mystery which suddenly seems to pull the whole film together in setting up arcs for resolution and delineation.

Aha! This meandering, directionless comedy now has a Goal to be achieved! :)

But! Horrors! Just when things were looking up, our guy's fortunes, next, all suddenly plunge below the toilet line, and he is at the lowest ebb of his life and the mercy of merciless Fate!

One thing---in almost all Korean movies they seem to eat thier way through. That is, they are always at table eating and drinking Soju, or snacking. I've never seen anything like it. It makes me HUNGRY, so I've taken up stir-fry cooking; the secret is to use lots of bok-choy, and there are recipes for authentic sauces online (not the crappy stuff sold in bottles in the smarket). Anyway, the whole eating thing seems to be a way to keep the narration going in Korean films. I shall try to find the etiology on this.

Needless to say: justice is served, all scores are settled, and a cute happy ending for all!!

Yay! :)",1375401600,,1991,4.5264623955431755
8522224,5,B007VHOI94,"I gravitate toward romance comedies, and this filled the bill perfectly. The actors are ones I've enjoyed in more recent productions, so it was also interesting to see this earlier project from them. I'd have liked a bit more romance, but overall recommend this for a light watch.",1363564800,,280,4.854166666666667
