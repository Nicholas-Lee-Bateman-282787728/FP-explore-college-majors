8132539,3,B000GI3KIK,"The dvd is probably good, as I have liked his other ones; however, this particular one keeps skipping and stopping. I assume it is damaged in some way.",1379808000,,151,4.428571428571429
8132540,4,B000GI3KIK,"I use this video primarily with fourth graders, but occasionally with third or fifth.  I'm a school counselor and we watch it in ""Lunch Bunch.""  Most fourth kids are mature enough to get the sarcasm and puns, but even those who don't quite will enjoy some of the visual jokes.  Some fifth graders turn their noses up at it because it's too ""young"" for them, but for the most part it gets the message across about being true to themselves, rather than what others want to project on them.",1358294400,,487,4.449438202247191
8132541,5,B000GI3KIK,This movie was very helpful to me. I never understood what a Cliques was until my young child started having allot of peer pressure at school. Then I look up this movie because I had other movies by Trevor Romain. And he has hit the nail on the head with this movie. I think it gave a clear picture of how one  should believe in themselves and not let others tell them who they should be. Thanks for having this movie and other movies from Trevor Romain to help with some of life struggles. You was truly a bless send to us by God to help me understand some of life's problems.  Thanks,1340150400,,585,4.168141592920354
8132542,5,B000GI3KIK,These DVDs are great. I've used them from K-5th Grade. The students love them and learn a lot from them. It holds their interest and they can relate to the topics and the characters. I highly recommend them for classroom and family use.,1327104000,,236,4.511627906976744
8132543,5,B000GI3KIK,"I have two Elem. age boys and this was really helpful in explaining what these ""cliques"" look and act like.  Because my boys are very visual learners, I was looking for a video too explain it. This was a perfect fit.  Although I believe this happens more often with girls then boys, it's still very helpful to know how to handle them.  It could even help a friend out later on:) Thank you Trevor Romain!",1274486400,,403,4.346666666666667
8132544,4,B000GI3KIK,"Even in preschool, my daughter has experienced the effects of cliques, and I heard it really ramps up in kindergarten.  So, in preparation for the next school year, I bought this video.

Trevor Romain is very good at making videos that appeal to children and speak to them on their level.  We have the video about bullies and now this one about cliques.  My kids are 5 and 7 and they love watching this video.  They keep asking to watch it over and over.  It helps me to open up a dialogue with them about what goes on in school and how to deal with it.

The lead character in the video tries to join a clique of girls, ignoring the kids who truly want to be her friends.  She changes her clothes, her hair and even her name but finds that when it comes down to it, she has lost her identity and her new friends weren't really her friends at all.  The message this video sends my kids is loud and clear: be yourself.

The weakness of the video is the clique accepts the main character, at least at first on an artificial level.  I would like to see a video where the lead character wants to play with a clique that completely rejects her, having her pine to be their friend all the while ignoring kids who are good potential playmates, and thereby remaining friendless.  That is a situation that really pains both children and parents.

Still I would recommend this video as a way to educate kids about certain social situations and to help kids talk to their parents about what's going on at school.",1234915200,4,1500,4.333333333333333
8132545,5,B000GI3KIK,"I borrowed this DVD from our local library for my 12 year old daughter.  She has asked me to buy it. She says she loves to watch it--the story makes her feel better about herself.  She also likes the music.

I highly recommend it...",1214524800,2,232,4.2272727272727275
