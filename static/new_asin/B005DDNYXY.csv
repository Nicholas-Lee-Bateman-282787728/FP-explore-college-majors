4657914,4,B005DDNYXY,"This is a story about a cross cultural and interracial romance. Colin Firth plays Matthew Field, a very cynical but successful and rich comic book writer. Nia Long plays Nimi DaSilva, a widowed Nigerian mother. Her son, Sammy, is enthralled by 'Saracen, Space Crusader' a character invented by Matthew Field. Through a series of events, Matthew meets Sammy and then Mrs. DaSilva (as she insists Matthew call her). Against her own misgivings, Mrs. DaSilva falls in love with Matthew, despite his cynicism, his lifestyle and most important of all, the disapproving messages from her family and acquaintances, all of whom are Nigerian and live in a very close knit community. Matthew falls in love with her but fights it every step of the way. He has an open marriage and is known for his flings. But he is drawn to her, her son and their sense of community and family. Complicating matters is the pending arranged marriage of Mrs. DaSilva to the local and handsome Nigerian priest.

The highlight of this movie is watching Colin Firth become undone because of his love for Mrs. DaSilva. There is a song that says you ""find love in unexpected places"". That is what happens to Colin Firth's character and he simply cannot digest it. He is used to playing by his own rules and he has met a strong woman who loves him but plays by her own rules. In one key scene, he is left incoherent because of his love for her.

The movie shows Nigerian customs regarding marriage, weddings, courtship, child-rearing, stereotypes and intimacy (which is key to why Nia Long's character insists Matthew call her by her married name). Both actors have great chemistry. Some actors in interracial romance movies do not come across as being comfortable with one another (Nick Nolte as Thomas Jefferson in 'Jefferson in Paris' comes to mind) although that is becoming less and less . Colin Firth spent part of his upbringing in Nigeria (even though Nia Long is a Black American) and he is right at home here...there is no uncomfortableness at all. Both are natural with one another and believable in their roles.

The bad thing about this movie is the continuity and editing...choppy in some places making you piece together what you think happened previously. And Ms. Long's accent is a bit weak. But the music is lovely, it's set in the south of France and the Nigerian costumes are gorgeous. All in all, a good movie.",1346889600,19,2395,4.766265060240964

8466596,4,B005DDNYXY,"Well ... a rom-com with a difference.  The portrayal of an expat community in the south of France, a writer, a little boy, and make all sorts of things happen, and you have an evening of enjoyment.  Nia Long is particularly beautiful and luminous.",1482451200,2,247,4.590909090909091

8466601,4,B005DDNYXY,"I adore Colin Firth and Nia Long, so a movie with them acting together was irresistible. Although it's not the best romantic movie I've seen, I recommend it because of the two lead actors. CF and NL have great chemistry in the movie and the actor that plays the child that brings the two together is just so adorable.  The only downside is you must have a multi-zone or zone free DVD player to view.",1418256000,4,399,4.32
8466602,5,B005DDNYXY,"I like watching this movie  while cuddled up with a good bowl of popcorn.  It's not the best movie and the plot is predictable, but there are a few surprises.  I bought an Region 2 DVD player because this movie does not play on the standard player.  Worth every penny.  Without giving too much away, man sees woman, man falls in love with woman.  The woman is somewhat promised to another man, but the other man is dragging his feet.  The woman's family wants this match, but the woman feels no passion.  Good movie.",1395187200,3,516,4.414893617021277
8466603,5,B005DDNYXY,"This movie, to me, shows how we all have an inherent need for not only love, but  the desire to be needed. Although Matthew (Firth) has what he thought was the perfect marriage, deep down inside he wants real passionate love [not the superficial ""love"" of an open marriage] and to be needed and wants a real sense of family. He developed that desire when he met Sammy, Mrs DeSilva's son. He became a father figure to him and when he met Sammy's mother, sparks fly. Matthew fights it, but in the end her love and his love for her and her son was just too powerful for him to ignore.

Although this film is a low budget film compared to what we normally see Colin Firth in, the story is so simple that it really draws you in. Nia Long does a fantastic job and the chemistry between her and Firth comes out fully. It is truly an awesome love story. If you love Colin Firth, you will love this film....trust me!",1383177600,3,907,4.236994219653179
