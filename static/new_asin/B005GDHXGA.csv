4690436,5,B005GDHXGA,"Please note that these are Region 2 DVDs (European) and will only play on a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player.  Season 3 which includes UK Series 5 and 6 in Region 1 (North American) format has yet to be released.....but hopefully soon!

The fifth series of Law and Order UK features the first major personnel changes since the show started in 2009. James Steel and George Castle on the Prosecutor's side of the story are replaced by Jacob Thorne, played by Dominic Rowan and Henry Sharpe, played by Peter Davison. I thought the new boys settled in well, but I still cannot get past thinking Doctor Who whenever Peter Davison appears!

We have six shows this time round to go with the 26 previous episodes. Apparently the way it works is that 13 shows are commissioned at a time and these are shown as one series in the USA. However, in the UK, they are split into two series, one of 6 episodes and one of 7 so Series 6 is next which is seven episodes. These continue to be sourced from the long running US series, which are screened for stories which will translate well to a UK setting. The US source shows for Series 5 were originally screened between 1990 and 1996, and frankly I did not remember the plots though I imagine I must have seen them all over the years. Having said that I really do not see why we should not have some written for the UK scripts at some stage.

The format of the programs is as previously. There is criminality which is investigated by the police, apprehension of the alleged perpetrator and then the legal procedure and outcome. Sometimes it does seem that 60 minutes is really not enough for all this and extended shows, perhaps to two hours would work better. Unusually, though, this time round the final show contains a shocking event, and the first show of the sixth series carries on from there, so this is the first two parter. In the main, this is absorbing stuff and very good entertainment. This show has already been commissioned up to Series 8 so plenty more to come!",1382140800,7,2013,4.461956521739131

This is in certainly not the fault of the sender or the DVDs themselves, rather it was my own stupidity for not reading the discriptions of the items more thoroughly.
