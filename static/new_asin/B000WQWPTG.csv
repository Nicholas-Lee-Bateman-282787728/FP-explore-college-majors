8225208,3,B000WQWPTG,"This DVD can be difficult at first until you learn the moves and can anticipate the next steps. The moves are fun and up-to-date and got me sweating. I would have sweat more if I didn't have to stop when I got lost or got the moves mixed up.
It's filmed in a low-budget studio of some sort, but this doesn't interfere with the quality of the recording. The instructors seem ameture, but they get the job done... and with some positive energy too.",1230249600,2,446,4.321428571428571
8225209,5,B000WQWPTG,"This is truly a fun, fun, fun work out. I get so into it that I forget I am working out!  It is a full hour and I am sweating like a pig after and when I am done, no matter how tired I am, I want to do it again....right a way!!!!! That to me is a good sign of a fun and great work-out!!!!

The steps can be a bit hard for beginners, but keep trying!!! For you who are more advanced...you will pick it up in no time.

Juliane Arney is awesome as always and I also like her friend Kari.",1216944000,4,484,3.6346153846153846
8225210,4,B000WQWPTG,"Juliane Arney has several workout dvds. She is very fun, outgoing, contagious positive personality. She cues YOUR left/right & she's good about breaking down moves & just teaching one section at a time. Kari Jensen has also been teaching dancers at colleges, etc. They got together to trade moves & then it built up to this. They have fun together which makes this dvd more fun as well.
Basic set w/Juliane & Kari. Music is decent, mostly a decent more recent beat, not as looped as some other workout videos. Sound is decent, camera work is done well, lighting is a bit bright.

Intro on Juliane & Kari - 1 min
Workout 1 30 min:
Juliane teaches in her usual great way as said above. She calls out the moves, not counts during the teaching/dancing. They teach each move 4x, then add another part of a move & repeat, so they are good about teaching the transitions. At first she only taught in tempo, but then would it slow about 3x as well, though they would move about 1/4 speed which is too slow to keep the heart rate up. Half speed would have been great. The moves are built up into a routine. You get your heart rate up & have fun more then most dance workouts & w/repetition, you don't get frustrated.
Warm up - 8 min - all dance moves, some of the moves will be used again
Dancing - 20 min - learn a routine
Cool Down- 2 min - some easy lunges, some of the dance moves done before

Workout 2 30 min:
Kari teaches, her voice is more even, less fun, to the point. She also calls out a name of the move, never counts during the dance which is great. This portion is more instructional, the emphasis here is on details, not repetition, having fun. There's no warm up or cool down. She teaches 3-4 moves together at a time slow 3x & then 3x tempo, then builds to routine. The moves require 1 small jump & 1 spin on the knees.

Professionals Corner 2 min:
Juliane & Kari giving ideas how to use this routine in a dance combining the moves & that they'd love the compliment of doing it.

This is great for those who want to learn hip hop but have 2 left feet & want something with repetition so they can get the muscle memory in as well as cardio from being comfortable with the repetition.
The only complaint I have other then the slow tempo being way too slow is that the moves are pretty good, but not as cool as some moves that are around. I would love to see more complex moves with Juliane's broken down by upper/lower body repetition of each move before moving on rather then Kari's several moves at a time teaching.
