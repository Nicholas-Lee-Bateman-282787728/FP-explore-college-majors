8135697,5,B000H0M3YY,"This was a well balanced DVD.  Mixed with history of every monument, and some modern day video.  I am pleased with my purchase.",1212019200,8,127,4.478260869565218
8135698,3,B000H0M3YY,"I was worried that this would only focus on the coliseum.  That was the first ""act,"" but they did cover other places in Ancient Rome.  This work speaks of Roman culture and history, not just architecture.  Architectural purists may dislike it, but fans of ""I, Claudius"" or ""Gladiator"" should learn something.

I still don't like the ""Ancient Mysteries"" narration style where they ask a question and then answer it.  Just say what you have to say and don't just speak to fill up space, Mr. Spock!  They interview a scholar who has a Condi Rice- or Elton John-style teeth gap.  She never states why she doesn't try to close it.  At one point, Nimoy gives a timeline of the world at approximately 350 BC, but most of the monuments mentioned here were made in 200 or 300AD, with some discussion of events after Rome's fall.

At one point, Mr. Spock tells the story of Remus and Romulus, but it had nothing to do with these buildings.  Again, it's space filler.  But still, some of these buildings are just parking lots now, so you and the documentary makers have to use your imagination.

This did make me want to visit Rome.  It is easy to forget that Rome was a major center of empire; it became a religious place in more recent times.",1190332800,12,1233,4.5
