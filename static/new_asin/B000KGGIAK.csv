8156371,5,B000KGGIAK,"This is a concert recorded in London. Melanie C performs her hits for her first 3 albums: Northern Star, Reason, and Beautiful Intentions. This is a must have for any Melanie C fans and for those who believe she couldn't make music, this will definitely change your mind. She divided the concert into two sections: Acustic and Electric. She is definitely the most talented female artist there is right now.!!!!!",1239235200,2,411,4.885714285714286
