8705750,3,B00UGPEAN2,"The last, and not one of the bestof the late Roger Moore ""Bonds"", is still loaded with incredible stunts and neat special effects.  And Roger is
totally pitching in, although with perhaps a bit less enthusiasm than in previous Bonds.  Actually, it has been said that he didn't really want to
do another one, feeling a bit long-in-the-tooth for yet one more Bond.  But, producer Cubby Broccoli prevailed, coaxing him back for this last
go around.  Location work takes us to the arctic, Europe, and finally San Francisco, beautifully photo graphed and directed.

Of ancilliary primo interest is also the included documentary on the shooting of the picture, including many facts about the setting up of some
pretty incredible and hair raising stunts.  I'm talking here about the special DVD edition of the film.  It's an expensive, well crafted film, but missing
that indefinable something that would have put it over the top... but didn't.",1497139200,,937,5.006451612903226
