6597571,3,B00MP2FPTC,"Wall Street, taking place in 1985, has Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) as a young and ambitious stockbroker. He idolizes the wealthy investor Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) and hopes to work with him and become a big player on Wall Street. When he finally scores a meeting with him, Fox learns that Gekko is a lot more ruthless about pursuing his agenda than he thought. How far will he compromise to make it to the top?

Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps takes place in 2008 amidst the financial crisis. Jake Moore (Shia LaBeouf) is a trader working at an investment firm who sees green energy as the future and wants to use his position to help that dream. He is currently dating Winnie (Carey Mulligan), Gordon Gekko's estranged daughter. Gekko (with Douglas reprising his role), meanwhile, has since been released from federal prison for his financial crimes and is now promoting a book he wrote. His years in prison seem to have made him realize that some things in life are more important than money and wants to reestablish a relationship with Winnie.

Wall Street is quite an entertaining film. Michael Douglas really shines as the unscrupulous Gordon Gekko as one of the most memorable villains of 1980s cinema. The movie is an intelligent look at the ""greed is good"" excesses of the 1980s while still being an entertaining film with interesting and complex characters. That seems to be the central theme of the movie: capitalism. How much is too much? Is greed really good? While at times some scenes seem to drag on a little too long, it is overall very watchable and at times thought-provoking.

Then comes the lackluster sequel. I would have hated to have been around in 1987 and saw the original only to wait twenty-three years to see this. The main problem of Money Never Sleeps is its complete lack of focus. Is it about green energy? Greed? Jake's and Winnie's relationship? Gekko returning to the world? The financial crisis? It is just all over the place. Worst, it never really seems to be about, you know, Wall Street. Another problem is the characters. You just never care about any of them and none are really interesting. It seems that Douglas really tried to revive the magic of the Gekko character, but it does not really work in the movie. I blame the script more than anything else. Sometimes it does not even seem like the same character from the first movie. In fact, the only other connection to the original film is a cameo by Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox, but it comes off as forced and dopey.

The original movie has one of the most iconic scenes from 1980s cinema where Gekko stands before a shareholders' meeting to berate the company's management and say that greed is good. Nothing of the sort is in the second film. This really exemplifies why Wall Street is so memorable while Money Never Sleeps is easily forgotten. It really feels like a wasted opportunity on the part of Oliver Stone.

Both movies come with an audio commentary by director Oliver Stone plus the original Wall Street has a forty-five minute making-of feature.

In conclusion, while Wall Street may have some minor issues, it really is a memorable, interesting, and entertaining film. The sequel is not a very good movie. Still, this two movie pack is decent if you really want to have both movies at a decent price. My three-star rating represents an aggregate between the two films.",1425686400,,3378,4.716949152542373

8673587,5,B00MP2FPTC,"Great quality double feature bluray.  Very good pic and sound.  Love the WALL STREET saga which started in the 80s and picks back up in 2014.  Fascinating to witness how the original characters evolved over time and how they are fairing in the new hostile economic climate.  Michael Douglas plays the heavy Gordon Gekko so artfully you feel like your literally being schooled.  How Douglas demands sympathy via his portrayal of down and out Gekko is difficult to resist.  Fabulous additions to the cast with Carey Mulligan, Shia La Beouf, Frank Langella, Josh Brolin, Eli Wallach and Susan Sarandon who literally breath modern fresh air into this 80s classic.  Love the Joan Rivers peekabo and Charlie Sheen (BUD FOX) notable scene with Michael Douglas was short but devilishly delectable.  Cast, story, set, wardrobe, location and cinematography are all 1st rate.  WALL STREET MONEY NEVER SLEEPS IS ABSOLUTELY A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO THE ORIGINAL.",1490486400,,946,5.130718954248366
