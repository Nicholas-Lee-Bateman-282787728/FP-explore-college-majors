8280507,1,B001AZ5ISS,"I stopped at about episode 5... I can't recommend this anime at all, especially with how little sense the actions of various characters make... you shouldn't hero worship a guy who attacked thousands of innocent people, destroyed their town, and nearly caused their nuclear reactor to melt down... to make a point it seems.  As near as I can tell the anime wants you to like that guy...  I suppose if you like to hand-wave stuff that makes zero sense then the anime is, if nothing else, pretty..",1426464000,,495,4.613636363636363
8280508,2,B001AZ5ISS,If you really don't like something I do no feel that you should have to apologize for it.  I know Anime and I know what I like and I know what I don't like.  Given the post apocalyptic scenario i felt I would enjoy it but I was mistaken.  I think my main problem other then the fact that you have seen all of these anime cliques before is how much Keel gets on my nerves.  I cannot get past him and unfortunately if you can't sympathize with the main character why bother?  The only character I found watchable was the Ostrich and while I am feeling charitable I guess I can't blame the baby for the nonsensical plot either.,1395014400,,624,4.166666666666667
8280509,5,B001AZ5ISS,"Really nicely done action-adventure, with believable human drama thrown in. There's even a young mother who
actually acts like a responsible, caring, person instead of some fan-service bimbette, and two teen brothers who
are more interested in being mature and supportive than in gawking at panties. It's an interesting series, a relic
from back when anime was about storytelling.
The plot is a kind of combination of Jules Verne and ""Waterworld"", and rather topical in a ""what if Al Gore is
spot-on and the Himalayas become prime real estate"" sense. The characters are mostly likeable,  if flawed,
human beings, even the Captain Nemo type whose loss of faith in mankind has led him to begin
contemplating pushing the ""Game Over"" nuclear button.
Really worth watching.",1383264000,,768,5.144

8280511,5,B001AZ5ISS,"A fun, rather short story as anime goes.  Good character development, good animation.  Could have used a little work on technical accuracy.",1224806400,2,139,5.2727272727272725
8280512,4,B001AZ5ISS,"This is one of those post apocalyptic type storylines where the world must deal with threats after being mostly destroyed.  They called it the Hammer of Eden, which presumably is some ultimate weapon.  The story begins when a populus island is hosting, an attempt to gather nations to create a new United Nations is attacked by cruise missles.  It's not like negotiations were going well, larger or more well off nations wanted bigger measures of control.  Of course thats just natural, and the way the UN is today, but in the anime its seen as a cause for conflict.

Trying to escape the destruction, are a young man named Keel and his friend, a beautiful pregnant girl, who is induced into labor due to the suddenness of the attack. I mentioned character designs in the title, because they are clean and distinct.  They are less like many anime character designs in that they have natural looking haircolors, well proportioned features, and are easy to differentiate. The pregnant girl's design is perhaps one of the most striking I've ever seen in an anime.

The boy, Keel and his pregnant friend end up abord a giant submarine, which is like a modern day Nautilus, and has a modern day Captain Nemo type as its commander.  Contrasting to the organizers of the potential new UN, this commander believes threats and intimidation, through attacks on the military will force the smaller nations to form treaties, and stop their warring. This anime is basically a contrasting of those two styles, as well as an attempt to bring them together by the actions of the youngsters.

There's some funny stuff for American audiences in the way the US energy mogul, a Texas-like oilman is portaited. Ultimately, the anime seems to bright and colorful for the kind of world it is depicting.  I would have liked to have seen these characters interact in a storyline of a much smaller scale, and a much less serious subject. Ultimately this series was much too short for what it tried to do.  The tragic events had less impact than they should have because the participants were not well endeared to the audience.  On story this really rates only 2-3 stars, but I couldn't help liking it due to the characters.",1221350400,9,2197,4.752631578947368
