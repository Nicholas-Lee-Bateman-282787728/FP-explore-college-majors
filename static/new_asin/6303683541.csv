8117780,1,6303683541,"The Car, 1977 film

It begins in desert lands. A young couple pedals their bicycles along an empty road. A big car follows them and forces them off the road! Elsewhere a couple play in their bedroom, their girls listen. In another place a man talks to his wife, a hitchhiker comments. Then that car drives up to hit him! The Sheriffs men investigate the death, the Deputies get their orders. A 13-year old artists sketch isn't appreciated. The Deputies find the bicycle wreck. Did the same car do it? At night that car struck another person. One native American said there was no driver in that car. They find the body of that young man.

A wind blows dust on a marching band. They are told to run to safety! That car shows up but does not enter the site. Can a Deputy stop that car with his shotgun? Can two police cars stop that car? Or a lone Deputy on a motorcycle? Is that car bulletproof? [The story drags on.] Can that car be found if it hides in a garage? Can the Deputy fix it so it won't harm anyone else? Will the exhaust gas affect him? That car chases the Deputy on his motorcycle. Then it crashes into another car on the road. Will that car go where the Deputies have laid a trap? There is a fiery explosion to put an end to that car.

Was this a failed attempt to create a horror film in a desert? A bad story makes a bad movie. Time and talent were wasted because of this unbelievable story.",1499558400,,1407,4.203703703703703

8117784,5,6303683541,"This video is very relevant to me since I drive a 1998 Mustang. The video shows the 1994-1995 Mustang being built (you can tell by the tail lights) and it's really interesting to see the whole process from giant roll of sheet metal to finished car. This video was made in the early 90's; I'd be interested to see how the process looks now in the new Flat Rock plant. I'd also be interested in getting one of the new engines and transmissions in my 1998. Anyway, this video comes in two forms. There is the regular version, and then there is a version that was included in some snap-together Mustang model kits. This version has a ridiculous-looking squawking parrot doing all the narration. Obviously it was intended for kids. Thankfully, this version is pretty rare. If you're into Mustangs, this is a must-have, but even if you're not a huge Mustang fan, it's still interesting to see the main parts of the auto assembly process. Plus, you get to see a couple of vintage Mustang commercials, and at the end of the video they take a Mustang GT out and let it run on the road, and it sounds sweet as it roars past the camera.",1285372800,,1125,4.4396135265700485
8117785,5,6303683541,"The video of how the Ford Mustang is built is great because you see all the steps in reasonable detail of how the car is built. And not just any car, but the legendary Ford Mustang. They also have a few nostalgic clips of classic Mustang production/commercials. I just went to the live tour of the NUMMI car plant in Fremont, CA. While the NUMMI tour was impressive, many of the car manufacturing steps could not be seen on the NUMMI tour (perhaps for safety and business reasons) can be seen on the Mustang video. This video is good for people of all ages who are interested in how giant factories work. It would make a nice gift.",1114128000,2,631,4.3559322033898304
