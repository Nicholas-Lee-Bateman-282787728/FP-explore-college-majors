The South's reliance on forced labor had profound implications for the customs and commerce of the U.S. It shaped the South's economic, cultural, political and intellectual development, and put the region on a collision course with its neighbors - and countrymen - to the North.

But slavery's impact was felt most powerfully by those human beings who were unlucky enough to have been born black.

The U.S. was once a land where men, women and children were sold to the highest bidder. It was a time and place separated from us by less than 150 years - but as far removed from our democratic self-image as the Dark Ages.

Black slavery was America's national tragedy. In the beginning, everyone had clean hands and a clean heart. But after the fateful decision was made to support the South's economy on the backs of African slaves, America and her people began a slow but inexorable slide toward the supreme crisis.

This is the story of the many ways blacks responded to their enslavement in America. It's the story of Harriet Tubman, Fredrick Douglass and Charles Lenox Remond. It's the story of white reaction, a story of late night patrols, lynch law and the roots of the KKK. It's the story of abolitionists, both black and white, who worked to bring about the emancipation of Southern blacks. And it's the story of how the U.S. finally was torn in two by slavery and how it has endeavored to bind itself back together ever since.",1110240000,,1558,4.713235294117647
