8706208,5,B00UGPVDOG,Outstanding movie. If you like old sea stories you will enjoy this movie.,1503446400,,73,4.6923076923076925
8706209,5,B00UGPVDOG,"A rich brat (Freddy Bartholomew) is dysfunctional due to his environment. There is always Sheryl Temple type stories of some kid being orphaned and mistreated. Luckily this is not one of those movies. Everyone except the kid has a full understanding of the problem and good solutions. The school authorities say that he has good potential, His father takes a direct interest and it was just unforeseen circumstances that changed his life. He falls off the ship and is rescued by a fisherman. He must stay on board for the duration of the season. This makes a natural environment to learn bonding and character.

It is not the outcome, but the process, which intrigues us and some unforgettable acting by Spencer Tracy.",1501977600,,718,4.885245901639344
8706210,5,B00UGPVDOG,"Spencer Tracy play a rough-and-tumble soft-heart Portuguese fisherman complete with whatever accent he's talkin' in and pull it off, that is.  ""Captains Courageous"" is a flatout downright GREAT movie and no they DON'T make 'em like that anymore. With Freddy Bartholomew as the spoiled kid, and a grand supporting cast including Lionel Barrymore, Mickey Rooney, John Carradine, Melvyn Douglas, and pioneering on-the-rough-seas photography, and a fine fine adaptation of one of Kipling's best stories. Make a special place for it on your shelf...and stock up on boxes of kleenex.",1120867200,4,577,5.48314606741573
8706211,4,B00UGPVDOG,"I first saw this film in about 1947, on a 16mm version shown in the home of my sailing partner at the time.  The part of it that stuck in my mind was the splendid shots of the Gloucesterman sailing on the wind in a big wind and sea,  the sight of that long straight forefoot rising, seemingly forever, out of a sea, before crashing down to split the next sea.  The film was worth it even for those few short moments showing that action.

I was probably too young at the time to read too much into the human elements of the film.  But when you turn it out on DVD,  whatever you do,  Do Not - Repeat - DO NOT ! edit out any of the sailing shots!  And I will buy it.",1119571200,2,663,3.859259259259259
8706212,5,B00UGPVDOG,"I first became aware of the movie ""Captain's Courageous"" forty years ago but I never had the opportunity to see it until the other night.  I had taped it earlier and was going to watch the start of it but my 12 year old son come in and started watching with me.  He was so engrossed in it that we both staid up til 11:45 PM to see it to the end.  The day after he kept mentioning what a good movie it was and I had to agree with him.  I mention his reaction because it's not that often anymore that we can see a movie together that we both enjoy.

The success of ""Captains Courageous"" lies in the quality of the writing, acting and directing coupled with a young lad's great adventure.  The movie starts out slow but necessarily so in order to introduce the main character; a boy about my son's age who is being raised by his widower father.  Dad has plenty of money but hardly any time to spend with his son.  Consequently the son has to overdo it to get attention.  It was in the midst of trying too hard that misfortune befell him and he ends up on a fishing ship in the North Atlantic.

The spoiled boy, named Harvey, is out of his element with these hard-working men of the sea.  They soon teach him the hard but important facts of life including how to get along with one another.  I'm guessing that you get the story.  The movie has its' emotional swings like most good movies of this genre do.

There was a lot of good acting in ""Captains Courageous"" with the top nod going to Spencer Tracy in his Oscar-winning role as Manuel.  Although I couldn't help thinking how much he sounded like Chico Marx, Tracy gave the role just the right amount of humour, insight, and irreverance that it called for.  Freddie Bartholomew did well as Harvey.  John Carradine and Melvin Douglas were good as well and I was quite impressed with Lionel Barrymore.  The interaction of the adults with one another and their sense of shared responsibilities helped to make this movie enjoyable for all ages.  There was plenty of action for the younger crowd as well as a leading role that they could relate to.

After waiting 40 years to see ""Captains Courageous"" I was aware that I could be in for a big disappointment.  I wasn't.  I enjoyed it as much as my son who previously never knew it existed.  Don't settle for a remake; the original is still a classic.",1119484800,7,2344,4.337931034482758
8706213,5,B00UGPVDOG,"I was maybe 11 years old the first time I saw this movie and I can remember to this day, many years later, how I felt and the impact it made on me. This movie takes you into a timeless tale with an array of emotions. While I like all Spencer Tracy movies, I still believe this to be my favorite. It reaches just the right note of humor, humanity, dignity, and human compassion. It shows how people can respond to each other in a positive way.",1112918400,3,442,4.091954022988506
8706214,5,B00UGPVDOG,"In todays violent world this movie is a respite into an age of basic values now deemed redundant.  Spencer Tracy, a Portuguese, mandolin playing fisherman plucks an arrogant rich kid (Freddy Bartholomew)out of the sea who had just fallen off his dad's cruise ship.  Not having their full catch of fish the ship remains at sea for several months.  The crusty but wise Captain (John Barrymore)assigns the boy to Tracy.  The theme centers on these two developing a bonding relationship that later provides the strength and maturity the boy needs in catastrophe.  A superb cast, superbly presented.  Recommended for all ages, and I believe especially for parents.",1104105600,6,659,5.11214953271028
8706215,5,B00UGPVDOG,"This movie is a favorite of mine.  I hope that someday it will indeed be released in DVD format.  I'll be waiting.  Obviously dated, it is still an excellent movie and it really gets to me.  I guess it's just one of those movies for me.  I can't rate it high enough.",1085011200,8,266,4.038461538461538
8706216,5,B00UGPVDOG,"I do not particularly care for black-and-white or old movies, but this has got to be my family's all-time favorite movie.  It has several great messages running throughout the movie.  If you have children, you may want to pick this movie up.  If you enjoy Spencer Tracy, you would undoubtedly want to pick this movie up.",1037577600,4,320,4.678571428571429
