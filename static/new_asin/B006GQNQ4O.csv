It's also nicely paced for a beginner. They also have tutorials for a lot of other programs that you would use in relation to CryEngine such as Maya, Z-Brush, Photoshop, and 3Ds Max.

I will say that these tutorials are quite good once you know the layout of CryEngine. I found myself pausing and having to replay his videos a lot of the times, even though I have some experience in CryEngine. For the money spent though this is a waste, you can get better quality tutorials for less over at DT.",1358553600,,663,4.479338842975206
8508791,1,B006GQNQ4O,"First, I'm going to say that the person in this video has a great deal of knowledge about the engine.  He also discusses very good points about level design.  But if you are not familiar with the cry-engine do not bother.  This man does not give narration paths i.e. let's load some vegetation brushes (3 very fast clicks no mention of basic menus...) and he's placing trees.  You will also hear he say ""yeah then there is a lot of repeating, flatten and then smooth and as you can see here i haven't focused on the game play area yet..."" Basically what he is doing is he modeled a level while recording it and then sped it up then he re-ran the footage and narrated it.  Go with Unreal Development Kit and gnomon Workshop intro video.  It's obvious to me that this guy who made the video does not know what an intro video really is or how to properly explain the engine just artistic and composition advice to which i digress is good. Once again avoid this video if you have no previous experience with this engine.",1355184000,2,1016,4.377659574468085
