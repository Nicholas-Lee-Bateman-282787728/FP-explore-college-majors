8389748,4,B0036B8TSK,"This black and white DVD is called ""Vintage Striptease"" but there is no 'Bumb and Grind' here. Instead we watch a pretty female with beautiful breasts doing the simplest things to show those breasts in all thier glory. Worth a look.",1357084800,,232,4.682926829268292
8389749,3,B0036B8TSK,"Contrary to the title, this video contains no ""striptease"". The women all pretty much start topless. There is some removal of clothing, but not done in any way that could be considered ""teasing"". The videos are black-and-white with analog noise, appearing perhaps to be 1980's though the Amazon write-up says 1950's and 1960's. The original video had no sound. A monotonous and repeating sound track is added; that is, they used the same boring music for all clips. In its favor, the women are all quite pretty.",1294185600,2,511,4.885057471264368
