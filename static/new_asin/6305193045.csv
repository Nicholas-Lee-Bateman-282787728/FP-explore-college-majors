8175742,5,6305193045,"And trust me we have TONS of videos.
My son prefers videos with REAL people, items, etc (VS cartoons).
Informative & entertaining.
Only thing I wish could've been different was to've been able to find it in DVD format.",1390953600,,218,4.615384615384615
8175743,5,6305193045,"I am the mother of a 20 month old baby girl.  I started my child watching the Baby's First Impression videos when she was 8 months old, now (at 20 months ) she knows her ABC's, her Shapes, her Colors, how to count from 1-20 and so many other things.  These videos have been my child's stepping stones to the ladder of her education, I would not known how to start the process of educating my child at such a young age with out them.  I as a parent highly recommend the Baby's First Impression videos to parents for babies of all ages, they will make a difference in your child's future.",1037145600,,586,4.214285714285714

is boring.  Its outdated, and therefore should only be had on discount.",1021680000,2,133,4.5
8175745,5,6305193045,"My kids have advanced SO FAR using these videos. They bore me beyond tears. However, my three year old has retained all that she has seen & my one year old will actually sit still long enough to complete a whole video. they love these videos. I love that they are so educational for them. WOW! AWESOME. WAITING FOR THE NEXT LEVEL, guys! Ready for more advanced impressions!",1018310400,2,373,4.5
8175746,5,6305193045,"This is a video series that I use to occupy my children when I take a shower and I am happy to do so.  They have learned so much.  My 4 year old could recognize and name all the letters and count to 10 at age 18 months.  This video series laid the groundwork and we built on it by counting blocks, flags and anything else we could find together.  She is now 4 and is considered an early reader!!  I attribute this in part to this series which is exciting and inviting and the kids learn too!  Now our 18 month old has begun to speak and the first words she uses are to identify letters and numbers!!!  It really works.
Get this series now before you need ""Hooked on Phonics"" later!",1013990400,2,681,4.075187969924812
8175747,5,6305193045,"Mom mother picked up several of these for our toddler (now 19 mo.)  She has over 40 words in her vocabulary, a large portion due to these videos.  She would rather watch ""her movies"" than a cartoon or Disney!  She's been watching them for about 6 months and is still glued to them the entire 30 minutes.  She dances and sings and now when we go out, it's all about pointing out what she's learned! :)",999475200,6,400,4.223684210526316
8175748,5,6305193045,Great Video!  My daughter has watched it since birth (now 2) and still loves it. Captivating!  Great gift idea for mothers!,951350400,,123,4.809523809523809
