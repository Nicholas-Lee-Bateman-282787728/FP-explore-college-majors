7425941,5,B0152AVZOM,"My girls are 7 and 9, and they love Owlegories! After the DVD was done, they immediately wanted to watch the next one, and we plan to get the APP and everything else they offer. The characters are endearing and I love the way God's love is demonstrated through creation.",1447804800,2,270,4.42
7425942,3,B0152AVZOM,"UK PLEASE, then it can have 5 stars.  Sample episode online is great - but where is the logic in selling only to USA / Canada????  I need this in the UK, as I have no intention of buying an Apple device or subscribing to itunes.",1445472000,,228,3.9347826086956523

7425944,5,B0152AVZOM,Cute series.,1445385600,,12,5.5
7426015,5,B0152AVZOM,We love watching our Owlegories DVDs. They especially come in handy for long trips or where we don't have access to the internet.,1491868800,,129,4.6521739130434785
7426016,5,B0152AVZOM,"If we're going to have TV time, I'd like for it to also be a time for teaching morals and Godly values. Of course, I'd like for my son to also enjoy it! We get both with these adorable Owlegories videos. I was unfamiliar with them but took a risk that paid off. They are cute, and they teach a simple lesson. My son is three and is at the lower end of the age spectrum for them (I think); however, he asks for these and laughs like they are the funniest thing ever. There are a few little (appropriate) jokes added in that may be mainly for the adults. I hope they make more of them!",1483315200,,583,3.9914529914529915

7426018,5,B0152AVZOM,We LOVE Owlegories! It is so well-written and has an amazing message. Your kids will laugh along with the Owls while learning valuable lessons. It's a great way to teach your kids about the Creator. Cannot recommend this series highly enough!!!,1475366400,,244,4.975609756097561
7426019,4,B0152AVZOM,"My 3-year-old loves the owls, but the non-animated parts of the DVD bore him and he loses interest very quick. I love that they're trying to teach the kiddos Bible lessons, but I feel like they should be more peppy and upbeat to keep the youngest audience focused.",1473033600,3,264,4.520833333333333
7426020,5,B0152AVZOM,"Everyone in our family finds this series enjoyable...like the motto they speak at the beginning of their class, like the learning themes they incorporate, the characters are all quirky and fun and music is good!  The pastoral summaries at the end are nice too and give deeper meaning to the content.  We have two boys similar ages to the series creator's children...it may appeal a bit more to boys, lots of movement and jokes.",1467590400,2,427,4.756756756756757

8732431,4,B0152AVZOM,"I think it is going to be very good. Love the way their are live children shown int he beginning who I assume are voices for the characters in the video. But our 3 year old grandson was very sensitive to the ""bad"" owl. So we had to turn it off. Look forward to seeing hoe the older children like it. It is full of Scripture and looks delightful.",1499990400,,345,4.0144927536231885
8732432,5,B0152AVZOM,I absolutely love these videos. They teach a great bible lesson along with something educational and moral. It does have a tendency to loose a really young child's attention during the part where the actual person comes on to talk but you gain their attention again when the cartoon part starts again. I would highly recommend these videos to everyone.,1494374400,,352,4.883333333333334
