8406485,5,B003V8CQD2,"I watched this show online and I fell in love with it right away. If you love J-drama in a school setting with humor, romance and fighting, do get this. It will make you laugh non-stop and keep re-watching it. I just recently bought it and got it yesterday, before it was suppose to come in so props to the sender, JD Shopping. When starting to watch it I noticed the subs where different then when I watched it online. No the subs are not wrong, it's just that not all subs will be the same word to word. Different people sub them. The ones I watched online was the site subbing them and the one's on the DVD are the people who are part of the company that came out with it. Even though there were a lot of difference on what was being said, it pretty much was meaning the same thing. I did noticed that Daichi was switched to either Ping, Chun or Dai in the sub, Ada was switched to Da and Adachi was switched to Li. These are just the names so it's not like you need to read there names, they say it correctly the right way. Also Daichi's favorite thing which came off ""annoying"" online was subbed ""dammit"". Like I said it's pretty much the same meaning. This is just heads up for anyone else that watched it online. I saw a little misspelling where they forgot to add a space, but nothing to big. Every time somethings sub its never going to be perfect. You should be thankful it is sub. If problems like this bothers you then I don't recommend ever buying or watching J-drama, wrong subs like his happens all the time. I still think this is still great DVD to buy.",1360886400,4,1569,4.198675496688741
