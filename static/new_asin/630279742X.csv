Something about this that is just so so good. This movie takes you on the full journey with the characters. Through the good, the bad, the ugly and the oh my freaking God I can't believe that just happened. This is what I love about movies from the 70s. You get that slice of life that makes everything else that happens so much more believable. Quite frankly it's a chick classic. That being said, I tried to get some younger friends to watch it and it was a hard pass. I'd say if you're under 30 (unless you like old movies) this might not be your jam.",1502755200,,700,4.185185185185185

521113,1,630279742X,"Unfortunately,the first few scenes of the movie every line was punctuated with a profanity. I would have wanted to watch the movie, but I guess I just lost $4.00 because I find the language unacceptable.",1456617600,3,203,4.828571428571428
521114,4,630279742X,"Good period piece for the late 1970's that works largely because the protagonist is played by a solid actress (Johnson) who captures the innocence of 16 and skates with realistic mastery. The musical score is strong too. Benson is a good foil because he naturally looks to be on the brink of tears, or anger or something and the movie is designed to be a tear-jerker. A bit too much time is spent up front on character development and that hurts the movie by shifting the structure to the right. The timing could have been fixed by editing down the three-scene seduction attempt/rejection by a 30+ year old newscaster (Huffman) of a minor. By giving Huffman too many scenes, the Director confuses the audience and puts a strangely unresolved twist on the protagonist. Despite that mistake, and a bit of heavy patronizing of the Johnson character by Benson's character and the father, the movie works. The forceful presence of Dewhurst, as well as key dialog, overcomes the patronizing and yields an overall empowering film for young women. It remains a relevant parable for amateur athletes and, of course, teenage girls. Not unlike the recent film ""The Hunger Games"" in some respects, but without the violent dystopia and contrived gender confusion.",1456531200,,1250,4.957142857142857

521147,3,630279742X,"As a fan of the original Ice Castles, I saw this and picked it up for a buck at a store closing.  Story was very close to the original, but I found the original more believable - the accident that caused the blindness, the coaching back to skating.  This version missed the spark the original had.  Was hoping Michelle Kwan would have a larger roll, perhaps as the coach.  Skating was better in the original as well (not over the top, but more
realistic for a girl who learned how to skate on a pond), but this version skating was more ""up to date"" ie, triple loops, etc. Both versions are very clean (no sex tho the innuendo of sex is in the original) and a joy to watch.  The skating and the story thrilled me more in the original where this was just...there...",1451260800,,763,4.270833333333333
521148,5,630279742X,"Wonderful movie!  Very adult.  Not really a kid movie.  Some language, some heavy petting, no sex.  But a wonderful story of overcoming an unforeseen tragedy to fine success and love. The soundtrack makes the movie move along.",1451088000,,226,5.027027027027027

521202,4,630279742X,"This was a good family movie, no bad language, sex, violence, drugs, etc. I did see the original, but, even though this one follows the storyline closely, I wouldn't compare them. The first movie was for adults and was much darker and deeper in many ways, and the language was a factor. This was a light version intended for a much younger audience (in fact, one of my few nitpicks is that the soundtrack sometimes verges, jarringly, on Barbie and the Rockers territory). The only real problem I had with it was how absurdly casual the movie makers presented Lexie's climb to the top in a sport that requires almost heartbreaking, and certainly bank breaking, dedication. You get the impression from this movie that all you need is a pond and a love for skating and in no time you'll be tossing off triples, winning competitions and gracing the covers of magazines. Parents, make sure your little girls know that's not how it works in the real world. This is fantasy; enjoyable and entertaining, but still fantasy.",1437091200,9,1014,4.734463276836158
521203,5,630279742X,Much better than 2010. Version.,1436400000,,31,5.4
521204,4,630279742X,"Released in 1978, Ice Castles stars Lynn-Holly Johnson as Alexis Winston, an up-and-coming figure skater on the threshold of worldwide fame who unexpectedly faces serious challenges. Robby Benson plays her hockey-playing boyfriend, Tom Skerritt her dad, Colleen Dewhurst her hometown coach, Jennifer Warren her professional coach and David Huffman a sportscaster who becomes infatuated with her.

This is a realistic drama first and a sports movie second. Its reminiscent of the tone/theme of 1976s Rocky except dealing with figure skating rather than boxing and Lynn-Holly as the protagonist rather than the Italian stallion. Johnson convincingly carries the film with her doe-eyed charm and Benson is likable as always. The other four main actors all kick axx, especially Skerritt and Dewhurst. The movie features a lot of figure skating, if thats your thang.

Johnson is such a charming petite cutie its not surprising that the sportscaster falls under her unintentional spell. However, despite her curvy beauty shes not that interesting as a person; perhaps because shes only 16 years old in the story (although Lynn-Holly was 19 during filming). Youll see this in the high society (of skating, that is) schmoozing sequence. While Alexis is a champion and charming figure skater, shes not yet developed enough to schmooze. So shes left pouting alone until she gets back to the ice. Dont get me wrong, Ive met 12 year-old girls who are fascinating (in a non-sexual sense) because they have an incredible imagination, but Alexis appeal never goes beyond her outward beauty, innocent charm and skating talents. Nevertheless, this is a quality 70s drama and figure skating flick.

The film runs 109 minutes and was shot in Minnesota and, to a lesser degree, Colorado.

521317,4,630279742X,"I know a lot of people liked the original better than this remake, but I can't agree. The original had a lot of language, and isn't what I would call a family friendly film. This movie on the other hand has little language and is a sweeter story.

The story is about Alexis Winston, a small town figure skater who has the ability to become a top notch skater. Alexis decides to leave her family and boyfriend Nick to pursue her dream of skating. Along the way she runs into some bumps, and learns the importance of a supporting family and a loving boyfriend.

The music is beautiful, the skating is excellent, and the acting is good. Taylor Firth isn't the world's best actress, but I thought she did a pretty good job for her first acting role. Also, it was nice to have an ice skater play the main role because she could do all of her skating, and didn't need a stunt double. There are cameo appearances by Michelle Kwan and Andrea Joyce, who play commentators. I'll watch just about anything with Michelle Kwan in it!",1414540800,,1020,4.420212765957447

521321,4,630279742X,"Fantastic film!!  Mr. Benson offers a sensitive, nuanced, intuitive, altogether brilliant performance as he gently glides from scene to scene, first as a budding ice hockey player aspiring to a professional career, later coming to the rescue of Lynn Holly Johnson after she falls into the clutches of an evil and manipulative and wretched and all-around ne'er do well attempting to dominate our young heroine, our true love and focus of attention and devotion, as she emerges from her controlling and domineering father figure (a colossal waste of Tom Skerritt's otherwise other-worldly talent as an actor). Worse yet, the evil ne'er do well has an accomplice - yes, a thirty-something, dirty ol' man attempting to hit on our beloved Lynn Holly Johnson.

Just as we are left to believe against our heart of heats, no, it can't be, our virginal Lynn Holly is left nearly blind after being forced to imbibe a concoction of potpourri and then skate round-n-round-n-round this ridiculously small, rinky-dink ice rink and then attempt a triple lutz over 4, maybe 5 barrels of whiskey.

But Mr. Benson comes to the rescue - oh, how he can with one small swoop of his hand, and one small film editing miracle, emerge from his expletive-laden diatribes to our hero beholden to our heroine as he steadily, surely, expertly guides her from an ice-pond somewhere in the vast reaches of Minnesota to the pinnacle of a regional ice-skating competition at the Broadmoor Hotel ice rink in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Does she win, does our beloved heroine win? We will never know - keenly aware of our roller-coaster emotional ride from one skating competition to the next, Mr. Benson leaves us eternally suspended at the end, forever hoping that the unnecessary, obligatory lip-locking session will end just long enough for us to see and hear the proclamation of Lynn Holly's ascension to the throne of lady's figure skating.",1412553600,,1912,5.00314465408805

1) A young woman learns about the trials of being a celebrity and the need to be grounded in family and true friends.
2) Lots of beautiful skating.
3) Message of true love and perseverance and hope in the midst of tragedy

Cons:
1) You never actually find out at the end whether or not she won. Maybe it wasn't considered important to the story line, but I'd have liked to know!

Storyline: WARNING!!! SPOILERS!!!  Lexi has always skated for fun and enjoyed it. One day, a coach sees her and approaches her to skate as a representative of him and his training. Then comes months of hard work... she loses the joy of skating, loses her good relationship with her boyfriend, gets a strained relationship with her dad... all in pursuit of higher and higher winnings. She is suddenly thrust into the spotlight and isn't exactly sure how to handle all the fame and glory [I really appreciate how you get a peek into celebrities lives through this].

521378,5,630279742X,"I finally got a chance to watch this movie last night.  Sometimes I balk at remakes because they just aren't as good as the original or sometimes I feel like they do a disservice to the original.  NOT with this one!  This remake was FANTASTIC!!!  I almost like it better than the original.

The acting wasn't as awkward and as others have put it, it's not as cheesy as the original.  I think Lexi starts off with way more confidence and there is just a bright spark about her in this movie.  I also do like how it concentrates a lot on the skating.  I liked the twist that her trist was with her coach instead of just a news reporter.  I like that it wasn't overdone either.  It was just very subtly there.  I also liked the modeling push and making her into the star better than the every day featurette they did of her in the original movie.  I really like just about everything in this remake.

The only thing that I was slightly disappointed in, was the scene where at the party she is skating on the ice and falls and hits her head on the ice.  I didn't feel that it was enough to constitute her going blind.  In the original when she smashes into the wrought iron tables and chairs and gets all entangled with them and they fall on her head and everything, it just made it more believable that she would have a head injury bad enough to cause blindness.  A simple conk on the head on the ice just didn't feel it for me.

All in all though, this was a terrific remake and well worth the watch!  I really enjoyed it!",1393545600,,1520,4.182758620689655

521439,5,630279742X,"I just streamed the video of Ice Castles and couldn't wait to write this review. Before I started typing, though, I had to go through some of the other reviews so that I didn't bore you with repetitious information. First off, I have not seen the original 1978 theatrical release of this film. My first encounter with this film was on TV, at which time I promptly ordered the VHS release. I was thorougly enchanted by the film and the performance of Lynn Holly Johnson. I later learned that she was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance, which I think she totally deserved to win. If my arithmetic is correct, she was 18 when the film was made and still she turned in a very credible performance. The story of a young girl who wants to make good (in any profession) is very believable. Yes, there is some language but that is the nature of any competitive environment. Hey people, get over yourselves.

Now to the reason for this review. I got rid of my beloved VHS player about 2 years ago and bought a streaming video player to hook up to my big screen. Many of my favorite movies and TV shows have been remastered in HD and I have had many, many enjoyable hours of viewing (I highly recommend Amazon Prime for your viewing option). Unfortunately this video has not been remastered in HD but fear not viewing public, it is very good in regular old letter-box. The video quality is very good. Of course the sound, by Marvin Hamlish, is superb. The streaming video is not available for rent on Amazon Prime but it is worth the cost of the purchase so that you may enjoy this classic any time you wish.",1365120000,2,1612,4.427609427609427

521505,1,630279742X,"Just from the first 10 minutes, there were missed subtleties that made the original great, that without which made this film kinda small. It was updated to the modern era, but for one thing the lack of a single section of film film killed the opening.

The first scene of the original has a white fog of snow before they zoom into the snowfield and her dancing. The remake has a direct to the snowfield and her dancing.  More direct is better, right? Wrong! The whiteness of the snow is a metaphor, subtlety, and foreshadowing.  Things which people in the seventies and eighties apparently knew how to do, back when hit movies like Saint Elmo's Fire were around. Nope, not only is there no subtlety or anything, but midway into the song which made the original famous, they cut it and play some hard rock song.

You also don't get a good sense of the characters. In the original, the bf when he quits his medical or whatever dream and is back in town says for awhile ""dunno why am I"" or the like, then you get the reason later that it's to see the girl, and he'll have to apologize to his parents later. The girl is developed as too old for professional, because she joined late (none of which is shown, except mentioned in passing).  The mom and dad are also better developed, the dad wants her to stay safe and was pushing her to wait, the mom is driving her because she was like a has-been skater herself (which again, is told rather than shown).

As a result of all this depth taken out, the film comes out flat and almost laughable. Take my advice, get the original.",1305331200,6,1571,4.381443298969073

I actually liked this version better than the original. It was easier to follow, had more focus on the skating, and was not as cheesy (yes, I do realize that's how it was back then) and opposed to many other remakes that add extra sex and swearing, this one had less... making it totally appropriate for young girls!  She has told me numerous times that she would love to ice skate, and she was enamored with the girls on the ice.

I can't wait to give it to her for her birthday in April!  I only wish I could afford the skating lessons for her!!

Updated:

So, I gave her the movie for Easter. Her mom called tonight and said that they all watched it last night, and that this afternoon, all she has done is sit and fast forward to the parts where they are skating. Her mom asked if we knew of any place around here that gave lessons!  I also gave her a pair of roller blades for her Birthday so she could start practicing.

521529,5,630279742X,"I purchased this CD because I had once watched the movie on TV what seems like a hundred years ago when life was indeed simpler.  This is a ""clean cut"" film about a young lady who had been ice skating her whole life on a country pond, and learned to love the sport. A local woman who appears to be a good moose hunter, decided she would train her for the nationals.  She wore a homemade costume and out-skated the country's best.

A fashionable woman who trains Olympic ""wannabes"" watched her and decided she was Olympic material.  The rest of the movie tells a story about a beautiful girl who was forced to change her ""country"" outlook on life in exchange for all the glitter and glamor associated with the road to Olympic success.  A tragedy, however, changed the rest of her life and she, with the help of a longtime friend, worked to overcome this seemingly impossible hurdle.  A wonderful lesson for all of us.

I highly recommend this to anyone who would enjoy ice skating, and a light-hearted romance movie.  This film arrived in a timely manner, and in better than expected condition as the vendor described.",1269388800,,1117,4.577889447236181

521532,4,630279742X,"The marriage of Maria Braun, Summer of 42,The innocent,Love story, Ice castles, and Don't look now were the most arresting, reminded and emblematic love movies during the seventies. Not only because the unerring fatal tragedy that nestled behind these unforgettable moments of elusive happiness, that never could materialize themselves by the well known destiny's caprices. The first two during the WW2 and the four last ones due the sudden fatality.

""Ice castles"" looks like - at first sight - as a primary love story. A promising talent from Iowa who is really disposed to participate in Olympics, sees how the disgrace stoles the only chance to be part of the selected sporting elite. And how, despite this irreversible fact, the love is capable to undertake the unexpected mission: to redeem itself and rescue the best of ourselves.

Despite of the fact I was in my middle twenties made me to preserve into my emotional environment, the haunting musical score of Marvin Hamlisch and the youthful freshness of their protagonists.

The story follows a young skater as she decides to compete, facing the usual obstacles of peer cat fighting, a long distance relationship, and personal sacrifices aggravated by a life changing disability. The topics get grazed over, sometimes too fast to have a huge emotional impact, but the ending success and competent young love story make for an enjoyable watch. The video quality is solid, and the 5.1 gets used more than one would think for a film like this. The supplements include:

* Behind the scenes, 12:53 minutes. A thorough look into the production, skating/acting mixes, and other assorted material without delving too much into the original work.
* Deleted scenes, play all option of 4 scenes totaling 6:38 minutes. All character stuff, which was too bad since this was her only acting performance, so all of the skating was left in the film.

One thing I noticed on second screening, was there was more to this story than a girl overcoming obstacles and the odds. There are two other important elements which I think raises this film as great: the intricate play between power and innocence,  and a finely woven dramatic fear of abandonment.

521555,5,630279742X,"Certainly a triumph for Robby Benson and Lynn Holly Johnson!  I didn't even know if this film had survived all the films being rescued from destruction by Hollywood these days in an attempt to restore so many great films.

There are times the tears start to drop from my eyes when watching this film.  When you are my age having seen all the tradgedies I've seen in my life, you tend to really appreciae the young and their battles: Something you don't really see in others when you are young yourself, until you are at least half a century old.

I especially love the scene when Robby (Nick) appears and helps ""Lexie"", played by Lynn Holly Johnson, face her handicap; after her accident where the two come together like only two soulmates could; as one reaches out to strengthen the other. Its beautifully played by both actors. Both kids, I should say young adults, are pretty much hitting full adult ""babehood"" with the public in this movie and the chemistry of both the actors and story make for a great addition to my library.

I've also been a long time fan of Colleen Dewhurst who does an impecable job in this film as the coach.  Colleen always carried a charisma in her face that could draw you into her just by looking at her.  Another actor who has this ability is Seth Green when I've seen his performances.  It's a gift when a person can do that on screen and it works for me!

521567,5,630279742X,"I have been enchanted by Lynn-Holly Johnson's bubbly personality and amiable charm ever since I saw her skate across the ice rink in the 1981 James Bond movie FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. While the majority of Bond fans seem to dismiss her role as an oversexed, yet naive ice skater as nothing more than simple eye candy, I thought she delivered an incredible performance and was one of the most attractive of all the Bond women.
So, perhaps it is no surprise that I love the movie ICE CASTLES (made three years before she became a Bond girl), what is a surprise is that it took me almost 30 years to see it.
So, when it appeared under my Lynn-Holly Johnson TiVo wish-list I set it to record knowing only that it features Johnson in a lead role and involved ice skating. Yet, over an hour into sitting down to watch it  I was once again entranced by Johnson and the unfolding human drama and hoping the movie would never end.
Yes, I am a sucker for tear-jerkers, especially when they tug so forcibly at the emotions. I expected to enjoy Johnson's performance, what I was not expecting was to get so caught up in the story.
Johnson plays Alexis `Lexie' Winston, a promising 16-year-old ice skater, living in Iowa (which as an aside provided extra interest for me, having lived there as an exchange student.)
Trained initially by small-time trainer Beulah (played by Colleen Dewhurst), Lexis jumps at the chance to take her dream of skating glory to the next level by accepting a coaching offer from world-renowned trainer Deborah Mackland (Jennifer Warren.) That is until an emotional Lexie takes to a late unsupervised ice skating session that results in an accident that leaves her blind.
It is the second half of the movie where this feature really shines and shows true courage (along with its leading character.)
It would have been so easy for the movie to have taken a `Lifetime' movie spin of showing a character dealing with shattered dreams and adjusting to her blindness. And at first it seems that the movie might go this route. But instead we see the courage of her family and boyfriend Nick (played by 1970s heartthrob Robbie Benson) in helping her get back on the ice and deal with her handicap determined to prove that she can still compete.
Featuring the Oscar-nominated theme song ""Through the Eyes of Love"" by former James Bond composer Marvin Hamlisch (1977s THE SPY WHO LOVED ME) and Carole Bayer Sager, ICE CASTLES is solid entertainment and very easy to recommend. In addition to those actors already mentioned this movie also features Tom Skeritt in an outstanding performance as Lexie's over-protective father.
I have to agree with the other reviewer who notes that this movie is one that even a guy can enjoy - I did, immensely.

521575,4,630279742X,"A classic figure skating movie, ""Ice Castles"" continues to endure despite its age and changes in the sport. The movie realistically depicts the crushing demands and sacrifice placed on competitive figure skaters, and the difficulty so many talented skaters of that era had against the scoring system when ""figure"" skating really was and 30% of the score was given to compulsory school figures rather than beautiful skating.

Skater Lexie manages to overcome her age difference and modest working-class background to pursue her dream after a world class coach notices her potential at the Regional Championships. But to follow her star, Lexie must leave her home, her beloved old coach and boyfriend. Are the harsh sacrifices and the radical changes to her life worth Olympic gold?

Lexie's dream is shattered by a freak accident that may or may not have been ""accidental"" there is a hint that she wanted out of the rigorous USFSA machine. She must then rely on her raw talent vs her now-limited sight for one last shot at the title.

The sexual content and Lexie's cheating on her boyfriend with a much older sportscaster (who shouldn't be having an affair with a teenager!) turned me off a bit but the plot overall is good, and of course Carole Bayer Sager's beautiful song is a timeless classic.

521578,3,630279742X,"Most will either love Ice Castles or hate it. Perhaps hate is a little harsh but it gets the point across. For a film with numerous shortcomings it has achieved somewhat of a cult following. So much so that Columbia Tristar decided to release it in DVD format several years ago.

What's wrong with the movie? For a film partially intended to appeal to the teenage crowd, it is unnecessary to have any foul language. Yet Ice Castles is sprinkled with four letter words from the beginning to the end. It doesn't advance the plot one iota and it's inclusion in the film is a mystery. Perhaps the producer thought a ""G"" rating would doom it at the box office and added the harsh language to get a ""PG"". Whatever the reason it degrades the film.

Many of the lines the actors speak seem to be more or less mumbled and hard to understand. Not sure if this is a sound problem or simply bad acting.

There is a severe lack of continuity in some scenes. For instance Lexie is first wearing a green jacket in the segment where she is learning to skate on the pond after becoming blind. Suddenly she is wearing a blue jacket in the next scene and just as suddenly goes back to the green jacket! Not to mention her being bare-headed and then is seen wearing a beige hat and then back to being bare-headed again! The producer must have been blind too!!

The original film was 115 minutes according to a New York Times review in 1979. However, the VHS and DVD versions are about 108 minutes. Where are the missing 7 minutes and why were they not included?

Nevertheless, despite these and other faults, the film works due in large part to Marvin Hamlisch's music and Lynn-Holly Johnson's beautiful skating. It is a three-hankie the first time you see it and has inspired many young hopefuls to take up the sport. A must-see if you like films that turn tragedy into victory.",1119744000,8,1859,4.455882352941177
521579,4,630279742X,"Heartwarming and inspirational drama, starring the lovely Lynn-Holly Johnson (THE WATCHER IN THE WOODS) and Robby Benson (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST), and featuring the Oscar-nominated theme song ""Through the Eyes of Love"" by Marvin Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager.

Alexis `Lexie' Winston (Lynn-Holly Johnson) is a promising young 16-year-old ice skater, living in Iowa with her widowed father (Tom Skerritt).  She receives her training from Beulah (Colleen Dewhurst) a former ice skater, now the owner of the ice-rink and bowling alley.  Beulah knows that Lexie won't achieve her full potential until a proper trainer takes her on.  So when renowned coach Deborah Mackland (Jennifer Warren) offers the chance of a lifetime to Lexie, she leaves small-town life behind and begins her quest to become a champion ice skater...until a freak accident shatters her dreams.

Now with the help of her father and Beulah, and the guidance of her boyfriend Nick (Robby Benson), Lexie sets out to overcome her adversity and skate one last time...

Filled with excellent performances and the soaring, emotional music of Hamlisch, ICE CASTLES is a satisfying movie experience.  Colleen Dewhurst and Tom Skerritt provide exceptional supporting performances.  Lynn-Holly Johnson, in her movie debut, gamely rises to the challenge in the demanding role of Lexie.  Robby Benson turns in a solid performance as Nick.  Only Jennifer Warren, as coach Deborah Mackland, seems cold and aloof (though this is mainly due to the character).

521580,1,630279742X,"I will never understand Columbia Tristar's decision to leave out one of the pivotal moments in the movie.  In the first competition that Johnson's character is in, during the routine, she FALLS ON THE ICE, thus resulting in the low scores she gets for her performance.  This part is cut in all the releases that are available, so all you see is a beautiful performance with way-lower than normal scoring!

This scene is even referred to later on in the movie when the trainer is talking to Brian, trying to get him to do a story on Lexie.  She refers to the sound of the crowds applause knocking Lexie on her butt, which if you haven't seen it before, leaves you wondering what she's talking about, because you don't actually SEE the fall in any of the releases except when it first came out in theatres many years ago.

The story would make a good family movie, but it does contain a pretty good amont of foul language in it, thus giving concern to parents when watching it with the little ones.  If Columbia would make an UNCUT version of this movie, I'd be delighted to try seeing it again, but until then, I just can't recommend it since it doesn't make as much sense as it could.",1090886400,26,1184,4.408256880733945

This constitutes statutory rape, and I don't think that aspect of the movie is a positive influence on an impressionable young girl at all.
I mean, this is the kind of movie today that draws all kinds of criticism for it's politically charged content.  Imagine that movie coming out today!!
Back when I watched it 25 years ago, the statutory rape thing was not an issue like it is today, but it is a very real problem.  Because of this, I don't know if I would let my teen daughter watch it.

521584,4,630279742X,"This movie is a must see. Particularly if you're a skater and if you're not, you're going to wish you were. This movie is one of the most unforgettable movies I've ever seen even though I was only ten years old when I saw it for the first time. I could watch it over and over and cry every time I do. Now at the age of 35, it continues to touch my heart with its sweet innocence. The main character Lexi who's a naive small town girl is more talented than she relizes, and more talented than her father (Tom Skeritt) realized.  However there are two people who acknowledged her talent. One, which was her childhood boyfriend (Robbie Benson) who thought the sun, rose and set around Lexi. She could do the most uncomplicated, straightforward move on the ice and he thought she was startling. They were best friends and shared an innocent, childlike, pure wholesome love for each other. The other person was Lexi's coach who truly recognized her talent for what it really was. She wanted Lexi to attend a competition however needed to persuade Lexi and her father that Lexi was exclusive and that her ability was of a caliber greater than they could ever imagine. As difficult as it was, her overprotective father let her go. Lexi proved to be successful repeatedly in  one competion after another. Soon she became popular within the skating group. Lexi was somebody now within the prestigious group of skaters and coaches.  This went to her head and started to lose that sweet innocence which made her so special. She became overconfident, smug and cheated on her boyfriend Nick with someone who was a recognized body within the skating crowd. Nick was no longer politically correct for Lexi. He was now just a small town nobody. During a posh skating gathering Lexi's passion to skate took over as she gazed intensely out over the dimly lit shimmering, iridescent ice surface. Every skater understand how such an ice surface is almost hypnotic and draws you to it. It allows you to be free to express your inner self and to be one with the ice. For a skater it's the only place you can truly do that  and be completely fulfilled and gratified doing it. This movie depicts a skaters passion and dedication for the sport so well it unbelievable. While Lexi skated so elegantly from the heart, and skating in the manner she was meant to skate, she noticed her new friends admiring her from up above. Suddenly, Lexi's egotism became apparent and tainted her beautiful natural style. She was no longer skating for the love of the sport, or from the heart. She was cocky, trying to impress her new friends who were shallow themselves. Lexi became overconfident and as a result received serious injuries that would change her life forever. The prestigious skating crowd soon forgot Lexi as she could no longer skate. She returned to her hometown to the people who truly loved her. They stayed by her side to get her through this horrible adjustment,including her boyfriend Nick. Nick was able to get Lexi back on the ice. He worked hard with her as he knew Lexi's zest for life was skating. Without her skates, Lexi was nothing. Miraculously, Lexi skated again. Lexi skated comfortably and gracefully on the ice just like she used to. The crowd wasn't aware of her disability and that's the way Lexi wanted it. She wanted to be judged fairly and on her ability. She didn't want to get the sympathy vote. When Lexi's solo was over, the crowd cheered for her. It was apparent, Lexi won the competition without a doubt. She received a standing ovation and Lexi was alive again. However, there was one factor Nick and Lexi overlooked in order to keep her disability a secret. When Nick realized their oversight, he was fearful for Lexi, and as a viewer, you will be too. The crowd was astonished by what they saw. The building went silent. Lexi scared, and  feeling lost cried out. Her reliable Nick walked out onto the ice and helped her up off the ice. The crowd cheered even harder for Lexi as she left the ice surface with Nick on her arm. This is truly a story of triumph over tragedy. As a result of this movie, the theme song ""Looking through the Eyes of Love"" by Melissa Manchester was the most popular song in the skating world.  Every skater at one time or another no doubt skated to it as it carries such a powerful message. It's absolutely beautiful.",1064016000,7,4351,4.600515463917525

My mother's secret crush on Robby Benson led us to the theater. (I think that was the only time we agreed on a moive--EVER.) The message--despite the feathered hair, bell bottoms, and over-eager acting--is a positive one. When great people with strong beliefs come together for one goal? Amazing things will happen.

521602,4,630279742X,"I recommend this movie for its music,the heart melting scene at the end of the movie,when Robby Benson goes out on the ice to rescue Lynn-Holly Johnson,after a golden performance in front of a huge ice center crowd. The one thing that captured my heart, was the compassion for character (Alexis Winston).She fought to the end with help of her boyfriend. Their is a certain style of humility at the end,that makes you feel for her. The sadness for which I felt was for what might have been. An Olympic champion?Although, it is not whether you win or lose but, how good you are in your performance,and what it took to be that good. That is what makes this movie good with an outstanding musical score and good acting performances.",1018310400,,728,4.607692307692307
521603,4,630279742X,"Who can forget this classic tear jerker?  A teenager from the sticks is bound for the Olympics when tragedy stops the dream and only determination can win it back.
Robbie Benson is a confused college dropout who knows as little about love as he does about life.  Alexis Winston is a young woman with extraordinary natural talent and dream to skate in the Olympics but filled with fear and confusion at the price success demands.  Her father is an embittered widower who lives in the past and holds tight onto his daughter with two hands.  The local skating rink is owned by Lexie's coach who was once a promising young skater but is now relegated to being the town's wacky character.
When things are going well, this quartet of dysfunctional people repeatedly hurt each other and themselves. But when tragedy strikes they band together with one goal in mind.  Can they do it?  You bet!
When my niece became interested in figure skating I rushed out and ordered this remembering it as a sweet story of love and skating and overcoming adversity.  However, after reviewing it I have to admit that I think it will be years before she will be ready to deal with some of the adult language and situations presented in this drama.",1017014400,3,1223,4.6342592592592595
521604,2,630279742X,"I read an article in which Lynn-Holly Johnson described this movie as a good family movie. She definitely should be proud of her accomplishments in the acting line as it was good that way, but I'm afraid I have a different view of what movies are appropriate for family viewing. I found the film to contain way too much swearing and it really took away from the story line which was not too bad. I am the first person to enjoy unrealistic, predictable movies with a romantic story line, but even this one was too unrealistic for me. However, the story was inspiring in that she overcame her disability and was able to figure skate again.",1005264000,8,637,4.5
521605,5,630279742X,"I saw this movie as a young girl.  I may have been around 11 years old.  This was the same time that I had read, ""Are you there God, It's me Margaret"".  Anyway, this is what I had imagined love to be.  It was unconditional and sweet.  I later bought this as a reminder of young love and my husband is tired of looking at it.  But, I can't wait for my daughter to see it!",1001462400,2,370,3.8026315789473686
521606,4,630279742X,Seriously.  It's a good movie that even sensitive guys can enjoy.,996710400,5,65,4.909090909090909
521607,5,630279742X,I saw this movie when I was 10 and I loved it I own a copy of it.  Its about a couple Lexi and Nick.  Lexi dreams of being a olympic Skater and just when she finally does a accident blinds her and she loses her self confidence and becomes angry and frustrated.  But she finally gets the self confidence to get back out there and skate blind.  And I think that is amazing for a person who cant see to do something so remarkable as skate that amazes me.,984096000,3,451,3.977777777777778
521608,5,630279742X,"""Ice Castles"" is the type of movie that isn't made much by Hollywood anymore (the one exception I can think of off the top of my head is ""Awakenings"").  The ""Triumph over Adversity"" genre seems to have died with the innocence of the 70's and 80's, and the start of the cynical 1990's.  It's really too bad, because many are just too cynical anymore to enjoy an innocent, heartwarming tale.  Gorgeous photography, excellent acting by most in the movie (I could do without Robbie Benson) and ultimately a story so moving that it will make anyone not jaded by the world start weeping.  Oh, did I mention that the soundtrack is terrific as well?  If you can find it, rent it.  It's a slice of the past, a slice of life and contains some positive messages, as well as being pure entertainment and a wonderful love story.  Never a throwaway, if you like it you'll be able to watch it over and over.  Oh, and throw away your copy of ""Edward Scissorhands,"" because this one beats it hands down and all over the place.",973987200,7,1009,4.445652173913044
521609,5,630279742X,"""Ice Castles "" is a heartwarming, emotional story about triumph over tragedy and love conquering all.  When Lexie Winston (Johnson) a  talented figure skater with her mind set firmly on the five rings is  blinded in a freak accident, her career appears over, and she hides herself  from the world, unwilling to face or accept what has happened to her, but  bolstered by the love, support, and faith of her childhood sweetheart Nick  (Benson), her father (Skerritt), and her first coach (Dewhurst), she makes  a triumphant return to life, and in extension, to figure skating.  Excellent performances, excellent scenery, and excellent skating make this  movie a perennial family favourite which can never be watched without  shedding tears.",967161600,17,738,5.230769230769231

521611,4,630279742X,A wonderful film about a figure skater who endures several tragic events and the hockey player who brings hope and love back into her life.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves skating or just good storytelling.  Add a  star if you skate yourself!!!,927504000,4,253,4.837209302325581
521612,4,630279742X,"This movie is pretty good.  Although there is some foul language, it is kept to a minimum, and not too obnoxious.  This movie is a MUST for any young lady who has interest in the sport of skating, otherwise, it is a  very good all around family show.  It is both a good love story and story  of overcoming adversity.",921456000,2,316,4.2
