The pianist is very good, but, and I really hope I am wrong, he seemed to be exhausted - and wasn't at his best playing Chopin. My personal oppinion is that everything is worth - every work is the best one could perform at that time - every note comes from the heart. But (another but....sorry....) this is not a super performance. You can have it to study the music. And that's always worth.",1124409600,4,498,4.365591397849462
