8457570,4,B00555ZTQA,Relive Jack's meanderings through Victorian London's east end.  A legendary story that still manages to grab our attention.  Quite enjoyable.,1384992000,,141,6.0
8457571,5,B00555ZTQA,"I was just adding to my serial killer section when I bought this one, and was very nicely suprised.  NOT another ""ripperology"" film that re-counts the same old timeline, rather, it focuses on the type of society and politics and mores - and the many little reasons, that old Jack was able to get away with what he got away with, and all the stumbling blocks that were in place as a barrier to police, from nabbing him.  Very well filmed, acted and narrated, high value reconstruction of events- and I really do suggest if you are a Ripper fan, that you check this out.",1328659200,7,568,4.4
