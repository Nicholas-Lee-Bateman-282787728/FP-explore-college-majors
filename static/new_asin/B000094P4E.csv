1879090,5,B000094P4E,I love these old Burt Lancaster movies as he was really a great acting artist. Who would even dare to go overseas and make movies for a sophisticated European audience? This is a sign of a true artist. Lucino Visconti has a real gem here. This is the type of film that makes you want to be an actor. Mr. Lancaster was also wise to evolve as an actor by choosing carefully what parts to play. For such a small film it's a powerful offering~~~!!!!,1388361600,,445,4.247058823529412
1879091,4,B000094P4E,"""Conversation Piece"", Luchino Visconti's 1974 film, a film made due to the director's being ill, actually, I believe, he was recovering from a stroke, is more minor an end result than even ""L'Innocente"" which would come later in 1976.  He died of a heart attack before ""L'Innocente"" was released.  I reviewed ""L'Innocente"" as well and had a high regard for it.  I liked ""Conversation Piece"" as well, but it did not have much of an intensity.  Perhaps this film is best looked upon as the opportunity for Visconti to address his own life as the professor, as played by Burt Lancaster, is drawn upon to be somewhat autobiographical and the story for ""Conversation Piece"" was based upon an original short story by Enrico Medioli, who was a frequent collaborator on other scripts for Visconti and co-wrote the screenplay with Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Visconti.  It's a well thought out script but not entirely successful in that the professor is merely inconvenienced by his tenants and any real effect upon his life by them is never achieved.  Yes, he has them to dinner, but the tragic consequences are sort of trivialized as at dinner they can discuss their real involvement as the same old bourgeois only more dangerous because it is in disguise, as the professor explains, but the fact that the proceedings are all rather stagebound taking place in several sets no matter how intentionally its supposed to be like one of the paintings the professors analyzes, it is rather lifeless ultimately.  I realize the professor's approaching death is being prophecized.  And there is a hollow ring to the whole proceedings.  Helmut Berger, Visconti's partner at the time, had an incredible debut in Visconti's 1969 ""The Damned"" and is again cast here.  There is a hint that Lancaster's professor has latent homosexual feelings.  But it becomes a father/son kind a bonding that barely takes effect.  The only thing that survives again is the professor's well being among his possessions.  It is apparently too late for him.  Also starring Silvana Mangano, Claudia Marsani and Stefano Patrizi.  Franco Mannini does the music again, as do Pasquale de Santis the cinematography and editing by Ruggero Mastroianni.  Dominique Sanda and Claudia Cardinale appear in flashbacks of previous characters in the professor's life, now a part of his memories. It is too bad the Helmut Berger character could not have more invaded the sanctity of the professor's bedroom as one of these tableau.  Raro Video has outdone itself with the Blu-ray for this film and provides a 16-page full color booklet with it.  Technicolor.",1385251200,,2598,5.016317016317016

1879094,3,B000094P4E,"""Conversation Piece"" is director Luchino Visconti's 1974 examination of the solitary life of a retired American professor (Burt Lancaster) who lives alone in a luxurious palazzo in Rome.  When he is confronted by a vulgar Italian marchesa (Silvana Magnano) and her companions -- her lover (Helmut Berger), her daughter (Claudia Marsani), and daughter's boyfriend (Stefano Patrizi) -- he is forced to rent them an apartment on the upper floor of his palazzo.

Before long, his quiet routine is turned upside down and the introverted professor becomes entangled in his tennants' machinations.  In the midst of this chaos, each of the new neighbors' lives, including that of the professor himself, takes an unexpected but inevitable turn.

Because of the film's limited settings, it has a stage-bound look, though Visconti does emply flashbacks to provide insight into the character of the unnamed professor.  The script deals with what it actually means to live, and the crowd of people who invade the professor's solitude serve as marked contrast to his quiet, introspective life.  Lancaster is effective and turns in a rich portrait of a complex individual, far removed from the more popular swashbuckler roles of his early career or his big-budget Hollywood pictures of the 1960's.

The newly restored Blu-ray edition contains an interview with film critic and screenwriter Alessandro Bencivenni and a fully-illustrated booklet.",1333238400,3,1429,5.40990990990991
1879095,5,B000094P4E,"I love this film because it is alternately in-your-face and delicately nuanced, sometimes in a single scene.

The other reviews here are very good, and I won't parrot those, but I do want to mention that Burt Lancaster is superb in his role as the retired, put-upon American professor. If you are familiar with Lancaster only through his big-budget Hollywood roles, see him in this, and you will will re-think your opinion of him as an actor. Then see him in ""The Train"" and ""Atlantic City"", ""The Swimmer"", and ""1900"", and you will have have a very healthy respect for his acting chops as he does a great job in these very different, but demanding roles.

This is a gorgeous movie to look at; it's emotional without being contrived, and it deserves to be more than a ""cult film"". I don't consider it to be inaccessible to the masses as many cult films are.",1331856000,7,856,4.5519480519480515
1879096,5,B000094P4E,"Luchino Visconti: one of the most important Directors ever! And,not just European! One of the masters from all over the World,and from every time!
All of his movies are worth buying, watching, enjoying, studying.
I always loved his taste, his class, his insightful perfection! He was never too excessive, actually very moral, very intense without ever going over board!
His first movies were extremely condensed, introspective, stylish and unforgettable.
His later ones were more open to a mainstream vision,like this one, nonetheless priceless and never compromised.
In fact, ""THE CONVERSATION PIECE"" (US Ok title for the Italian way more Classic sounding:""GRUPPO DI FAMIGLIA IN UN INTERNO"",which more or less, means 'Portrait of a Family in Interns') shot in 1974,is an everlasting classic film, that i keep recommend watching to those who can,always getting call back's or even thank you notes, for having them acquainted, to what has now became also one of their favorite films!
Shot with a great technical crew,and a certainly not small budget,at least for European scales,and, with an international and (then) potent cast, which became so much of a Key role to the Success of this movie,that, in fact, it is easier to tell a little about it,just by mentioning the principles:
Burt Lancaster,never better,as the Professor,the real protagonist,but also the teller,and ,ultimately,and quite ironically,also the victim,of this very Roman tale of Decadence that so finely nails a certain horrific World and Society,dominating both morally and politically, the complex,yet fascinating Italian scene of the early 1970's, where protestors,and Aristocrats,sex and drugs, politicians and Church,Arts and Costumes,frauds and scandals,civil terrorism and underground dangerous neo nazi's lobbies, were plotting,at times, even intersecting against, and with (fascinatingly!)each others,with Helmut Berger, as the mysterious,desperate gigolo' and angel,at the same time,who becomes a symbol of self destruction, so typical of those days,and,class act's Silvana Mangano (in what for me remains her most sublime acting effort ever,and look,as well!) as the still wildly attractive,crass talking, self deprecating, patrician and bored,amoral trophy wife of a powerful and highly corrupted Italian major industrialist,adding to the mix, 2 controversial newbies,like Claudia Marsani (sort of a deceiving,irresistible young nymph,like, for those who know Italian Cinema,at least a bit,Stefania Sandrelli,had been a decade earlier,sort to speak..) and handsome,aristocratic looking, Stefano Patrizi, as again, 2 and, so very perfectly 'Viscontian' representations of Youth,contaminated and deeply affected, by the corrupt World they were raised and brought up in, yet,in some morbid way, becoming as the narration unfolds,almost more and more attractive and lustful,just because of the sins they innocently commit clueless or not, almost every day!
Then, even outstanding character actors and Visconti's regulars, Romolo Valli (immense actor) and Philippe Hersent,depicting other minor yet extremely key figures in this landscape of darkness and perversions, and finally,the special Guest Appearances of 2 of Visconti's favorite movie stars of that time: the wonderfully photographed and forever enigmatic,almost truly divine, Dominique Sanda (as the Professor's American socialite mother,quickly telling us all we need to know about the Professor's extraordinary background, in 2 Flash Back's I can only consider like 2 examples of cinematic perfection),who appears actually on the cover, of this so long over due Blue Ray's presentation of this forgotten (in USA only)Visconti's Classic,and also an actress,Visconti wanted to work with, more, and,had in fact planned several projects for,unfortunately never made, because of Visconti's recurring illnesses, and premature death.
And,last but not least,in one emblematic,and very revealing scene,the special appearance, also in flash back,of another great international Star, Claudia Cardinale (who'd been the lead, instead, of 2 major movies of the Maestro,already!)as the Professor's ex wife.
What else to say ,without really wanting to spoil this masterpiece, who's also a guilty pleasure of a film to watch, and, for those who love, like me, the Italian Cinema of the Past,or Recent Past,a gem not to be missed, while, for all Others, a lesson on Filmmaking, without ever becoming a boring lecture, but actually, being always an extremely engaging and elegant,at times,even sexy and mundane,dramatic portrait of a certain International High Society, so common during the 1960's/1970's, and not only in Italy! However, this Film, besides becoming one of the most gorgeous and hauntingly existential films ever made,about morals and customs (like Schlesinger's splendid Julie Christie's Academy Award Winning vehicle ""Darling"" penned by the great Frederic Raphael in 1965,a film Visconti liked very much,or, in some other ways,a bit like,sort of becoming ,a more penetrating study,for example,into one of the several stories, intersecting in Fellini's masterpiece,and one of my personal favorite films of all time, ""La Dolce Vita"" from 1959!) offers not only that,and an attempt and accomplished essay at serious characters' development,as well, but,certainly,also, a full piece of an important slice of relatively recent Italian history,and, in a way, how to see(and... understand,maybe Why!), and in Visconti's case, tragically, yet so genius,How to foresee, what happened of wrong and abrupt, from just a decade later and on,to these current days, to Italian's actually highly unstable, and at times,even laughable Political Affairs,or to,even all the scandals,bribes and murders of this Country's shaky Economics,but,most of all, What destroyed in Italy the passion(way,nowadays,too long forgotten)of its people, for their Culture,and immense and celebrated,yet almost misunderstood, Arts' Public patrimony, one of those, being certainly, the loss of their past,as one of the greatest,most innovative Cinema ever, when people were lining up,in America,and all over the World,for films from Directors and well known Masters like, Fellini,De Sica, Rossellini,Antonioni,Pasolini, Zurlini, Germi,Petri,and so many more,i cannot even try to mention all on here, and,of course, like Luchino Visconti, himself, and this grand little film, which again shows the potent meaning,and never ending strength of those much celebrated times,and their Film makers!
Again, I'll repeat: A MUST SEE!",1330992000,7,6521,5.872497365648051
1879097,5,B000094P4E,"All Visconti's movies have been applauded as winners, and, while Leopard is a superb work of art, others, such as the Innocent, fail to live up to the Visconti's charisma.
Conversation Piece, is great, although not as good as The Leopard.
To analyze it better, let's start from the title.
The original title, picked by Visconti was  RITRATTO DI FAMIGLIA IN UN INTERNO, which literally translates into ""family portrait in an apartment"". and it is more true to the story, which is about this group of people who have become a family for elderly professor(Burt Lancaster).
Burt Lancaster delivers a winning perfomance as in the Leopard. Probably that is what happens when you pair a great actor with a great director. The same can be said for gorgeous and talented Silvana Mangano. The kids are forgettable, and then we have Helmut Berger who is just being himself. It seems that he plays always the same character. From Luidwig , to Cabaret to Conversation Piece, he is always the androgynous, tenebrous hearthrob, who actracts women, but maybe is more eager to end up with a man. To close, again, one of Visconti's best, and, if you listen carefully, you will find a solid moral content and a message to parents to watch over their teenage children anytime, anywhere.",1235260800,3,1266,4.8341013824884795
1879098,5,B000094P4E,"For being made by Visconti, this movie is relatively short (under 2 hours). And it is in english (instead of italian). Set in the 70's, Burt Lancaster (also seen in The Leopard) plays a professor who describes himself as slightly 'hysteric' and very sensitive to people, noices and 'formalities'. He lives in a large old house in Rome alone with a servant and surrounded by books, paintings and expensive objects of art. His tranquil existence is smashed to pieces as a super rich, eccentric and egocentric woman (Silvana Mangano) with her lover and her spoiled child (and a young man who I'm not clear if he's the lover of the daughter or the son of Silvana...? I have to watch again...) demands (for some reason) to rent the upper floor for their visits to Rome. The professor gives in, partly because he is offered a sought after painting as payment for the first months rent.

Conversation Piece is very entertaining and fun, but it also has a dark existential streak dealing with why we need other persons. The professor is somehow trying to shut out the world and replace the messy social relations with more manageable things like paintings and books.

The transfer of this DVD (Arrow films) is not excellent, but it's certainly good enough: I watched it on a projector and it was fine. I suspect and hope that Criterion, Bfi or MoC will release a version of Conversation Piece sometime in the future, and with extra material, which this DVD lack entirely (not even the year of release (1974) is stated). But, considering the ok transfer and the low price this DVD can easily be recommended.",1230595200,7,1598,4.724014336917563

7989275,1,B000094P4E,"Note: I have seen the film before and it is fantastic. If you are a fan of Italian films, then I highly recommend watching it. My negative review is specifically for this Blu-ray.

The copy I received began skipping approximately twenty minutes in with the English audio. With the Italian audio, it will last until about the thirty minute mark before skipping to nearly the end of the film. I had requested a replacement copy since the first one I received also had this problem. However, when I tested the replacement, I made the mistake of using the Italian audio which made it past where the problems started on the English audio, making me believe that this version was fine. It wasn't until just recently when I just tried to watch the film that I realized the problems were still there.

Bottom line:

Great movie, but horribly produced and unusable disc. Do not buy this copy.",1491868800,2,883,4.647435897435898

Impossible to watch such a great movie under those conditions.  I tried to play the DVD in three different BlueRay DVD and the same problem in the three of them.
