1686862,4,B0000633SV,"Unlike past documentaries on Tupac Shakur, who's sole purpose is to make money off of Tupac's name, this DVD is an honest look into the exciting life of Mr. Shakur. Right away you can tell that the people involved in this project were the people that REALLY cared and were involved in Tupac's life. Whether it's his first manager, to his friends from Oakland, or Mr. Humpty himself from Digital Underground (The group Tupac broke into the music business with.). Shock G's memories of 'Pac alone is worth the price for this DVD. He takes us to the days when Pac was barely getting into the music biz and when Tupac started getting attention for his solo work. These stories are hilarious, honest, and endearing. This DVD also includes a lot of Tupac interview footage from when he was a young, innocent, 17 year old, to when he was a full blown thug at the still young age of 25. This project doesn't dwell too much on Pac's death, it's more like a celebration on his life. Also, if you're expecting a lot of footage from his Death Row days, then don't look for it here. Although it does show a few moments, this is more like the Tupac circa '91-'95. As a man points out on here, people make it seem as if Tupac was in Death Row for years, when in actuality, he was only in Death Row Records for a mere 9 months. Watching this DVD makes you feel at times that Pac was an annoying, loud, young man. Which he was, don't make a mistake about that, but what the difference with Tupac was, is that, it was an enjoyable type of annoyance. His charm and charisma could win almost anyones heart. Many people always had the bad impression on Tupac letting the media effect their point of views on Pac. But, as Tupac always said, ""Only God Can Judge Me"". It's funny how the show Tupac at age 17 saying that he wouldn't dare call women the ""B"" word, and right after they show him at age 22 saying
 ... His view on women changed from when he was young when he considered women beautiful, and worthy of praise, then in his late early 20's he despied them. Why? Just read or investigate about his rape trial and you'll get the answer. As Shock G pointed out on here, it is absurd to think that any rapper has to go through the trouble of raping a woman when they can get almost any woman they want on command. Shock G's story of what Tupac said to the Judge during his sentecing, will bring ANYBODY to tears, that is, if you have a heart. The message this DVD is giving is that Tupac was a simple black man with great thoughts and ambitons. Quincy Jones once said that if he would have died at age 25 he would have been considered a struggling Jazz player and nothing else. If Malcolm X would have died at age 25 he would have been known as a street hustler. With this, Quincy makes us realize that Tupac Shakur had HUGE potential. Not only as a rapper, but as an activist, and political leader. A look at this DVD takes you into a journey you never knew of Tupac. Whether you enjoy his music or not, this will MAKE you fall in love with Tupac Shakur. And what better way to bring it to us than being told by his personal close friends and himself?
As far as extras go on here, there is a unreleased track on the menu, and there are extended interviews of the people that knew him best. Also, they show Tupac's mind blowing library collection that will shock you. And there's also never before seen pictures. This is a must have for ALL Tupac fans. Even people who have never even heard of the name Tupac will enjoy this. A look into the life of Tupac Amaru Shakur. The Man, The Myth, The Legend.",1019088000,51,3581,4.2739322533136965
1686863,5,B0000633SV,"This dvd is the best documentary dvd's i've ever seen! It still hurts to watch all this cuz i because its amazing to see how tupac shakur has changed from age 17 - 25, and in the dvd it shows it. It doesn't show that he was a thug, but a really intelligent man. Its sad how he had to ""die"" at only 25. This dvd has changed me somewhat in the way i look at things, and such. In my heart i still want to believe that Pac is still alive somewhere, but if he isn't this dvd will defintately make it feel like he's gonna always be alive forever...",1018828800,5,542,3.891891891891892
1686864,5,B0000633SV,"I'm hesitant to buy any of this Tupac stuff because I know a lot of things are being slapped together just to profit off of the name. This is a high quality DVD from the packaging to the menu screens, to the extras. The people that are interviewed on this DVD are people that Tupac himself would have probably chosen if he could, And they give great insight as to who he was. People like Shock G from Digital, Treach from Naughty, Pac's old drama teacher that he lived with for a while, and Pac's half brother Mopreme Shakur. Not to mention Quincy Jones (his son produced the DVD). It would be great if some of the people who try to emulate Tupac's thug ways would try to emulate the other side of him; an avid reader, a thinker, and someone who craved knowledge. The DVD has a list of SEVERAL books that Tupac read, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that we had a few in common. A good DVD to learn more about Tupac, and possibly a great spark to get people learning about other things in life as well.",1018742400,10,1008,4.227979274611399
1686865,5,B0000633SV,"if u would look at me, u probably wouldn't suspect i would even care about 2pac or any form of hip-hop.  when ever i cross people of those sterotypes, i show off my knkowledge.  people consider me a ""punk"". i listen to punk and ska music, but i also listen to hip-hop. and i mean ""real"" hip-hop not the ""bling-bling"" rap on mtv (and i am not dissing on this form of rap i am just saying that i don't always prefer it and it has brainwashed teeny-bopper kids at my school that this is the only kind of rap out there and this is only what what rap/hip-hop is about).  and this is what i am saying:  anyone can listen to what ever they hell please.  tupac amaru shakur is not only one of my fav rappers hes one of my fav poets, activists, actors, and individuals.  he has had a great impact on my life.  i believe everyone should listen to his messages and look at his life.  and this film totally depicts that.  i love this.  i totally recommend this to everyone and i am going to show this to my ""anti-2pac"" friends that are closed-minded and ignorant how friggin awesome he was (and is).  buy this if you're a fan of his music or movement or even if youve never heard of tupac.  peace",1018137600,,1184,4.144736842105263

1686867,4,B0000633SV,"THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST DOCUMENTARY OF TUPAC SHAKUR. (THAT IS UNTIL VH1 DOES THEIR VERSION BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW HOW GOOD THEY ARE WITH  DOCUMENTARIES OF MUSIC ARTISTS).  THE ONLY KNOCKS I HAVE OF THIS DOCUMETARY IS THAT IT DIDN'T INCLUDE MUCH IF ANY OF TUPAC'S MUSIC AT ALL IN THE BACKGROUND-(THEY DID USE SOME BEATS FROM ONE OF PAC'S PRODUCERS QD3, BUT HEARING PAC WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER), AND THE VIDEO CLIPS OR ""SOUND-BITES"" USED IN THE FILM WERE FROM THE EARLIER PART OF HIS CAREER.  BUT ALL IN ALL, THIS FILM BLEW THE FILMS ""THUG IMMORTAL"" AND ""BEFORE I WAKE"" OUT OF THE WATER.  IT IS A MUST BUY FOR ANY FAN OF RAP/HIP-HOP.",1017878400,,631,4.322033898305085
1686868,5,B0000633SV,"Thug Angel was perhaps one of the greater documentarys on 2pacs life I've seen.  It is definetly not a waste of money at all.  From unseen interviews with Shakur himself (which other DVDs lack) to interviews with Big Syke, Shock G, Mac Mall, Storm, Edi Amin, Johnny J, Kidada, Quincy Jones, and so on.  This DVD focuses more on the life on 2pac Shakur rather than just the death of this great man.
There are some misinterpretations in this DVD, as some of 2pacs comments come out as seeming racist and we all know he was not.  Everybodies in the struggle whether black or white and he's said this many times its unfortunate they didn't include him saying that in the DVD because some parts could really aggrivate some fans.
Although, I couldn't have asked for anything more in a DVD, except maybe some Audio made by Pac which is unfortunately missing.  However over all this DVD is worth picking up.
Thanks to QD3 and everyone involved for putting this together for us, the fans.",1017878400,7,979,4.571428571428571

1686882,5,B0000633SV,"As to say this, I can't get my eyes on Tupac. 'Cuz he had a lot going on in his life, you know what I'm mean. You see Tupac will be telling a lot of stories of his past when he begin writing poetry at a early age, learn to act, and how to be a superstar in the rap business. Yeah Tupac been gone for 7 or 8 years now, but in 10 years he'll be remember 'cuz he modered a generation for the hip-hop community. I also a lot of people from that culture to Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, JFK, RFK, and on and on.

Now a lot of people are still talking about him and how he became a part of our culture. That's why he lived his life the way he live b/c of the fight with Biggie, the East Coast/West Coast rap war, how he got arrested, been in jail all of his life, need I say more?

Nobody even care on how he lived or how he died. He help changed that by putting it into his lyrics. The reason why I love him the most is there's nobody like him like Jada Pinkett Smith ""There's nobody, nobody like that man. I don't care how many records you sell. I don't care how popular you are...""

You know Tupac lives on and he'll always will be to the fullest.

For those of ya'll are missing out a lot of good information about this icon, I urge you to check him out. He's one of the greats that put it on since Martin Luther King and Malcolm X we learned back in the day.",1102118400,4,1358,3.8392857142857144

1686908,3,B0000633SV,"Hmmm this is a great Tupac biography thing but I don't think it is the absolute best one released.  It didn't cover much of his life after he made it big, or for a matter of fact his death.  However, of what it does cover it covers very well.  On the other hand the quality of the video if quite weird.  It reminded me of the E!  True Hollywood Story.  You see, this man didn't go out and conduct the interviews for the show, well not all of them anyway, he gathered some from other people interviewing them about Tupac from years and years ago.  Some of the people seem very insightful, however, some of the people didn't provide to much insight above the obvious and seemed to be added just to take up time.  Overall, there is much good in this movie in information wise, however the production of this move needed MUCH work.  It is enteratining at points but at points you tend to fall asleep.  There are better biography's out there on the greatest out there.  I reccomend going out to get one of them.  Thanks for your time and I am out.  HOLLA!",1041811200,3,1050,4.269035532994923
1686909,5,B0000633SV,"im not talking about (thug angel) movie but
It's the latest in entertainment news, and if you haven't heard by now, the Los Angeles Times newspaper has announced that they know who killed rapper Tupac Shakur. Los Angeles Times reporter and prize-winning journalist Chuck Phillips, has declared that the late rapper Notorious B.I.G. (killed the year after) is responsible for Tupac's murder. Earlier on the night of his murder (September 7, 1996) Tupac and Suge Knight had attended a Mike Tyson fight at the MGM Grand Hotel and Ceasars Palace. The first part of Phillip's report appeared in the LA Times today (Friday, Sept. 6, 2002), the second is scheduled to run in tomorrow's edition.
Phillips claims that Biggie (a.k.a. Christopher Wallace) provided the weapon used to kill Tupac as well as a $1 million bounty. The report also identified the man who pulled the trigger as Orlando Anderson, a former member of L.A.'s Southside Crips gang. Just hours before Tupac's death, Anderson was jumped and beaten by Shakur and his bodyguards (who were also part of the Crips' rival gang, the Mob Piru Bloods). Until now, Anderson was never identified as a suspect in Tupac's murder and was later killed in an unrelated shooting. Chuck Phillips' report is based on his year-long investigation which supposedly included interviews with members of the Southside Crips who had never before spoken out about the killing.
Shortly after his beating, the report claims that Anderson and the Crips set up a meeting with the Notorious B.I.G. (who was also in town for the Tyson fight) in the penthouse suite at the MGM. The report further states: ""According to people who were present, the Crips envoy explained that the gang was prepared to kill Shakur but expected to collect $1 million for its efforts. Wallace agreed, on one condition, a witness said. He pulled out a loaded .40-caliber Glock pistol and placed it on the table in front of him. He didn't just want Shakur dead. He wanted the satisfaction of knowing the fatal bullet came from his gun.""
Despite the fact that Biggie and Tupac insulted each other in public and in their own music, three days before his own murder, Biggie discussed his turbulent relationship with Tupac on a San Francisco radio station. When asked if he had a role in Tupac's killing, Biggie responded by saying ""he wasn't that powerful yet.""
The details within the LA Times report go on and on. The ultimate question now remains: is this report revealing the truth? Or is it as valid as the other rumors (including Tupac faking his death) that have circulated among hip-hop fans? The truth may never be revealed. All that is certain is that the saga of Tupac's (and Biggie's) murder continues.",1031788800,3,2713,4.874458874458875

Tupac Amaru Shakur was the realest and most true prophet that blessed this world. Tupac poured his heart and soul in his music and left us with his beautiful essence that will life forever. Tupac expressed what was in his soul and thus it made him vulnerable. When he died I cried for the longest time because I knew someone so beautiful, intelligent, strong, unique and compassionate had left this earth. It felt like I had lost someone I knew and loved all my life and it's because he gave us his soul in his music and lyrics. I am so grateful that he had a loving mother who reared him in the proper direction, that is truth. Tupac/Makaveli transcended and is truly in a better place.
