6750797,1,B00OHLR6KU,"Save your money. Seriously. The acting is atrocious, and the writing was worse than sophomoric. I doubt humorous writing could've saved this bomb.",1423180800,,146,5.391304347826087
6750798,3,B00OHLR6KU,"This film is the sequel to Asylum's ""Hansel and Gretel"" although unless you saw the first one, you wouldn't know it and will be totally confused by the film as ""the witch"" is long dead. That was the film with Dee Wallace and the meat pies. Brent Lydic has returned to play Hansel. Stephanie Greco had to wash her hair so didn't return for Gretel which is now wonderfully played by Lili Baross who gives us a fine ""B"" actress performance.

It seems the witch was part of a larger coven and Hansel has been traveling the past year killing witches. He has ""seen things that would turn your sh@# white."" Meanwhile Gretel has taken over the shop and still makes the human meat pies, which for some reason is a major disconnect for Hansel.

Hansel reads where a friend has gone missing in his home town and goes back to investigate. His sister joins in as well as another young couple and a witch's coven shows up. The title, which is a plot spoiler for the first 30 minutes, when Gretel goes rogue and we never know what side she is on from scene to scene. The end scene brings out our suspicions about Gretel but then tosses some stuff in that really didn't fit in with the rest of the stuff that didn't fit in.

WAIT a second this is a Mockbuster of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters 1& 2 .Sheesh,#2 won't be out till 2016,But the end of this flick IS A SPOILer ???

Okay,Just gonna get on with my review,For one thing huge fan of Jhey Castles (Havent seen her since DEATH RATTLE : CRYSTAL ICE,Since was on The Asylums Naughty List for 2 years and missed her bigger Hollyweird fare.

Jhey leads a coven of witches wanting to pick up where Dee Wallace Stones LILITH from HANSEL & GRETEL left off.

Hansel has really become a Bad Arse Witch Hunter(c) and Gretel,Not so much.

The Witch Coven members have different powers and so deaths are pretty creative,If thats a Thing.

6750896,1,B00OHLR6KU,"I guess I should have read the notes on this ""movie?"" Naw, I only really bought this DVD because I thought it was a continuance of the original Hansel and Gretel. I couldn't have been farther from the truth.

The story is set in modern times (should have been my first clue) The attempt to introduce the ""witch"" aspect to the movie was ham-handed and did not really flow with the rest of the plot. (Plot? What plot?)

The action and fX portions of the film was truly low rate and unimaginative. The acting was some of the worst I've ever seen outside of an 8th grade pageant although, to be fair, I've seen a couple of 8th grade pageants that were much better done than this movie.

I feel as if I am a victim of a bait-and-switch con game. This movie was presented in the same manner of the ""real"" (good) Hansel & Gretel on the DVD cover, kind of implying that this was a sequel to the original but turned out to be anything but.

Bottom Line: DO NOT buy this DVD. It sucks so BAD!!! If you have already bought this dreck, do what I'm going to do, give it as a Christmas (or birthday) gift to someone you don't really care for very much and let them enjoy the movie.",1428364800,9,1167,4.173333333333333

The Asylum films appeal to people that are not expecting a big budget blockbuster. Like other Asylum movies, this one has action and an interesting story with good but not ""A"" list acting. I enjoy most of the movies from The Asylum Studios.

I guess when there is a ""vs"" in the title, there should be a big showdown or something. There was an ending fight but it was far from epic. In fact, the two siblings don't even duel until the very, very end, and for like two minutes. Really was hoping for a bit more action, a bit more story, a bit more of everything because there is a lot going on but nothing ever takes off.",1423958400,,636,4.096

8683565,5,B00OHLR6KU,"This movie is a cross(no pun intended) between Vin Diesel's Witch Hunter and a classic fairy tale. Hansel & Gretel are now hunters and have fought every supernatural(good TV show) threat there is. However, the more you play with fire, the better your chances of being burned as they soon find out. Not evrything is as it seems in the home when Hansel is fighting a new set of witches with extreme abilities. Gretel is helping but has a terrible secret. When Hansel finds out he now must make the decision to either kill her or let her kill over and over again. This is one movie made for SciFi Channel that actually is very good with good effects, acting, and of course, gorgeous women. This is not like stinkers like Sharknado that are overrated and overpublicized. This was made VERY good. No rating but I would rate it PG-13 to TV14. Do not underestimate this one!",1466208000,,867,4.528662420382165

8683569,2,B00OHLR6KU,Not what I thought. Poor acting...nothing like 'Hansel and Gretel' as we remembered it. It's pretty grotesque as well. I didn't finish watching it. It was thru prime thank goodness.,1463011200,,181,5.066666666666666
