7962987,2,B000067IZY,"I own the complete set of ten ""Wet & Wild"" videos from ""PLAYBOY"" in one box on 4 discs. Summer Altice in #9, Rachel Marteen in #8, and Lisa Scott and Patricia Ford in #7 have my favorite scenes in them, but Tawnni Cable, Jennifer Lavoie, Angela Melini, Barbara Moore, Maria Checa and Deborah Driggs also have good scenes in some of the others. The first two are tamer than the last ones, except the very last one is tamest of all. I never watch it, as a result. ""Playboy"" should be getting better with each video it makes, but this one is a regression to the first ones or even less. Barbara Moore is wasted in this #10, especially compared to her hot scenes in #6. I didn't pay much attention to the cast of this last in the series, for it bores me, after seeing some good ones made previously. Unfortunately, ""Playboy"" quit making videos in 2009, so we must all make do with the existing ones, but there are many of them. I checked on some I hadn't seen and they sounded good, so I bought several from Amazon.com.",1327276800,,1015,4.291666666666667
7962988,4,B000067IZY,"This is the first installment of Playboy's ""Wet And Wild"" series of home videos, and also the one which seems the least contrived.
The models are, of course, stunning goddesses... but hey, it's Playboy. My personal favourite would be Anna Clark, Miss April 1987. Unfortunately, her sequence is entirely too brief, but keep an eye out for it. She's quite possibly the most beautiful Playmate overall that I personally have ever had the priviledge of gazing at. The other models are jaw-dropping beauties as well, and most sequences in the video feature them cavorting tastefully in some aquatic setting or another.
A beautiful video featuring adorable women, just as advertised. And a pleasant diversion for an otherwise uneventful day. Thumbs up for sure.",1061424000,6,755,5.146341463414634
7962989,3,B000067IZY,"If you're a Barbara Moore fan you'll be disappointed. She only appears for about two minutes in the last scene. She looked okay but not as good as she has looked in the past. If you're a Dita Von Tease fan, this is a fantastic video. She appears in two scenes and looks great. The only complaint about the Dita scenes is not enough ... shots.",1049241600,5,342,4.196969696969697
7962990,3,B000067IZY,"I was disappointed again with this video from Playboy.  I would expect a company that has been photographing and videotaping women to produce a better product.  I have been a fan of Playboy for over 20 years so I know what their track record is.  This video starts out with a couple of short clips of the actual Bikini Show in Vegas - it made me want to see more, but that was it. There is not much of the actual show.  The ""Backstage"" scenes were disappointingly average.  The women removed their bikinis and the camera panned up and down their bodies.  Each scene pretty much had the same level of eroticism - medium.  The women were beautiful - just what you would expect from Playboy.  But they didn't generate a lot of excitement or heat.
If you want to know what I like from past DVDs from Playboy, check out the two ""Shower Scenes"" or the ""Carwash"" scene from the ""Cheerleaders"" video or ""Double Exposure"" from ""Girls Behaving Badly"".",1032998400,17,941,4.4941176470588236
7962991,4,B000067IZY,"Very Hot. Great segments, although the middle drags a bit. Jenny McCarthey and Cori Nadine light this one up. The last feature, three girls in the shower, is awesome. All three have killer bodies, ample breasts, and make  good use of the soap. Good video to own!",961891200,3,262,4.574468085106383
