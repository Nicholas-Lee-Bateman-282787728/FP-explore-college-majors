8331610,3,B001OVKB1M,"On a prison work-farm that brews formaldehyde (!!), some of the inmates inhale the fumes to get high. It definitely puts them in a lighter state of mind! These foggy-headed inmates break out one night. Oh dear! During the escape -in a truck loaded w/ formaldehyde- the men are gunned down in a cemetery. The warden orders them to be buried on the spot. Unexpectedly, the dead inmates rise from their graves, causing murderous mayhem. Horror occurs as the ghouls arm themselves w/ pick-axes and shovels. Filmed in 1972 for no money, TOMB OF THE UNDEAD (aka: GARDEN OF THE DEAD) boasts a cast of never-knowns as the convicts, sporting blue prison shirts w/ their numbers hand-drawn w/ marker! At only 57 minutes, it still manages to seem long and dull. Extra schlock-points for the sadistic, black-suited, black glove-wearing warden! He's pure eeevil!...",1378771200,,852,4.965034965034965
8331611,1,B001OVKB1M,"This movie was so bad...I had to laugh at my mistake of ordering it.  Poor acting, background scenes, the whole movie was what my family refers to as a Class F(fluke) movie.  The only good thing about my order was, the movie was received in excellent condition...probably because no one else had watched it!  I can hardly believe zombies would be interested in the opposite sex
for any reason...the dead also were shot and killed...again.
My recomendation for the serious zombie enthusiast would be ""Resident Evil"".  If all you want is to spend money and get a laugh ""Garden of the Dead"", which was for me a waste of my time and money, will definitely be your best bet.",1048291200,3,669,4.5966386554621845
