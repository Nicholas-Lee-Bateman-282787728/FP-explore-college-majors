3965573,5,B002PNLI38,One of the most well-rounded workouts out there.  Encompasses everything you need to stay fit and prepare for the big event.  I felt prepared for labor and it helped me get my body back within months.  Highly recommend this!!!,1285718400,,226,4.743589743589744
3965574,5,B002PNLI38,I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and have been using this DVD my entire pregnancy. I love that you can customize your own workout from the menu screen. I have found it to be a great way to stay in shape during my pregnancy and find it very relaxing. I have tried a couple of other Prenatal workouts and I must say that this is definitely a favorite!,1284681600,,349,4.147058823529412
3965575,5,B002PNLI38,I got this DVD early in my pregnancy and used it a few times a week- I found it very relaxing and it helped strengthen my mind and body for the birth of my beautiful baby girl.  She was born in January and I was back in shape by April- I love this DVD and Diane Fong is an amazing yoga instructor!!!!!,1284076800,,301,3.8548387096774195
3965576,5,B002PNLI38,"After seeing how quickly my best friend rebounded from her pregnancy, I had to find out her secret. Not only was her first birthing experience a breeze, her pre-mommy figure was back in no time. You would never have known she just had a baby! Well come to find out, her secret was this DVD!  Seeing the results she had inspired me to check out the DVD for myself. And although I was not expecting, this program actually gave me a great workout as well! I still use it to this day!!! So EVERYONE can benefit from it! Definitely a must buy!",1283558400,3,538,4.2745098039215685
3965577,5,B002PNLI38,"I ordered this video and it's a wonderful soothing yoga video. The instructor has such a peaceful voice, you don't need to be pregnant to get the full value of this awesome yoga video.",1283558400,,184,4.4411764705882355
3965578,5,B002PNLI38,"This is a beautiful well-made video.  Kudos to Diane.  When you use the DVD, it feels like she's next to you helping you with the poses!  Two thumbs up!",1283472000,,152,4.172413793103448
3965579,5,B002PNLI38,"Diane does a wonderful job making difficult moves EASY especially for someone who is expecting. Because your center of balance is off after a certain point of your pregnancy, you don't think you can do  much of anything. Diane proved me wrong. Not only is she a calming and soothing presence, she makes the moves look and actually FEEL quite easy to do. I recommend her video 100% to all mothers expecting.",1283472000,,406,4.638888888888889
3965580,5,B002PNLI38,"I used this from about 8 wks through my entire pregnancy.  I was running 3-4 mi befre getting pregnant, and had some issues int he first trimester & had to stop.  Staying active was important to me, so I was excited when my OB OKed this routine early on.  The workout is easily adapted to your growing belly, and since each section is it's own chapter, you can mix it up if you start to get bored.  I gained a healthy 24 lbs and managed a non-medicated natural birth with minimal discomfort which I partially chalk up to the ""conditioning"" from this workout (and my Bradley Method class & awesome hubby/coach!)",1341619200,,610,4.468468468468468
3965581,5,B002PNLI38,"I am used to practicing yoga and wanted to find a prenatal program that was right for me and my baby. After researching, and viewing many YouTube videos I came across this one, and I am so glad I did.  Diane (the instructor) is VERY pregnant and for me this adds a level of comfort. You know that if she is doing these moves at 35 weeks they must be safe. There are three main parts to this workout, as well as a warm-up and a cool-down. I like that you can do the entire workout or create your own workout and do one part at a time. The dance part is my favorite. It's easy enough for beginners yet challenging enough for intermediate or advanced. This yoga workout always leaves me feeling rejuvenated, calm, centered, and connected to my baby. I had back pain that hasn't returned since I began this program. I highly recommend it to any mommy-to-be or mom who wishes to rid baby weight fast after delivery. It is worth the price when you think of the cost of one yoga lesson. Love and light to all new moms!",1335744000,,1011,4.238341968911917
3965582,5,B002PNLI38,"This DVD changed my pregnancy and my life! First time mommy suffering from all the symptoms.. and this DVD gave the breath of fresh air I so desperately needed! I cancelled another DVD to buy this one and I am so glad I did! I love the sculpt, I love the dance, and I love the whole DVD! Its really great that you can create your own work out, leaving no room for boredom of repetition! I love that I am preparing my body and my breathing for birth and I love how relaxed and refreshed I feel after each work out! What else can I say? I LOVE THIS DVD! And so will you!",1334966400,,568,3.9478260869565216
3965583,5,B002PNLI38,"I am 21 weeks into my second pregnancy, and this video provided exactly the workout I've been looking for! Although she moves quickly through the sculpt, dance, and yoga sections, which may be hard for a beginner, I appreciate not having to listen to instructions over and over, as I watch this video repeatedly. On the main menu screen, you can choose to learn the dance moves before even beginning the workout. I wish I had gotten it sooner, so I could have learned the routine before my belly really started growing. Sometimes, my movements are slower than hers, resulting in fewer repetitions. Because of so many quick movements, I would suggest using this DVD after you are at least 12 weeks pregnant, and the pregnancy is established.",1328227200,,740,4.7890625
3965584,5,B002PNLI38,"This is a great mother-to-be workout! Diane is a great inspiration on the DVD and demonstrates everything easily, giving options for different exercises no matter what your exercise level or ability may be. She explains in detail how to do everything in a tutorial, including a dance instructional. I like that there are three very different styles of exercise with the option to change up your routine depending on the day, or do the whole 50 minute workout covering all three areas. At the moment I'm in the early part of my second trimester but I think this will be even more helpful in the third trimester as it will be more difficult to do other workouts. I also bought a copy for my sister-in-law who loved it because she wasn't sure what exercise was safe for her to do as she got further along in her pregnancy. I highly recommend this to mothers-to-be.",1325635200,,861,4.597402597402597
3965585,5,B002PNLI38,"This was the only ACOG certifified DVD that I could find on Amazon. She shows beginner, intermediate and advanced levels for most exercises. The music isn't annoying. In the beginning you get a little lost because she doesn't verbalize every time she changes her moves but once you do the video several times you easily catch on and you will be appreciative of her not taking the extra time to say movements that you already know to do. I feel great after each use! Seeing her do this video at 35 weeks inspires me to continue because when I started I was only 18 weeks.",1320019200,,570,4.438095238095238
3965586,3,B002PNLI38,"I wasn't very impressed by this DVD.  I liked the yoga, stretching and sculpting, but the dance wasn't very enjoyable... I felt pretty silly doing these strange dance moves in my living room and it didn't even give me a good work out.  I liked how you could customize the workout and I felt like I was getting a pretty good workout by just doing the warm up, yoga, sculpting and cool down for the first two or three weeks of using the DVD.  After a few weeks though, I got pretty bored with it and eventually stopped using it because I had basically memorized the moves anyway.  If you have any experience at all with yoga or exercise at an average level, I wouldn't suggest this DVD.  I originally purchased this because of the good reviews, but if you want to feel results I would suggest trying something different.  Prenatal workout videos tend to be gentle and easy, so you might have to try a few until you find something you like, but this one is more expensive than the average and it definitely isn't worth the higher price tag.",1319760000,,1037,4.403141361256544
3965587,4,B002PNLI38,"I was very pleased with the fast delivery.
I used the DVD the next day and found it went just at the right pace for me.
 My only criticism would be that she is very quick to change position, but the exercises are good and informative. Showing you the variations if they are needed.",1318032000,,281,4.203703703703703
3965588,4,B002PNLI38,"I have not yet tried the video. I am currently between 16 and 17 weeks. This is my first pregnancy and I am young, 19 years old. I love to dance, and I needed a way to get in shape and stay active. When I seen the title of the video, I thought it'd be the perfect dance video to try since it has dance, yoga, AND sculpting. And the ""Birth, Baby, and Beyond"" was a huge plus. But of course, I was still skeptical. By reading the reviews I have been inspired to go ahead and order the video. I will get back to you if it is a success.
Thank you.",1308268800,,543,3.814159292035398
3965589,5,B002PNLI38,"I own quite a few prenatal workouts. This, however, is one of my favorites. It is not too intense, but it isn't too weak either. I'm in my last trimester and have reached for this DVD more than most of my others. I find the music and the movements to be soothing and I always feel so much better after working out to it.",1306540800,,320,4.015625
3965590,3,B002PNLI38,"The instructor is in fabulous shape. It is a great video if you are in fabulous shape as well. She moves from one position to the next as quick as lightning. The average pregnant woman can't move that quick especially in the third trimester. I want to believe that I would do this video after I have my baby but I don't enjoy doing it pregnant so I don't see myself doing it after baby. I don't have any other prenatal videos to compare it to but I took a lot of instructor led classes. This was neither calming nor encouraging me to push through. The exercises she does are the same as for a non-pregnant person. The stretches weren't relaxing because she would quickly shift from one position to the next. Very little emphasis on breath. I would only recommend this video if you are in great shape,  start it in your first/early second trimester and if you can pick up the routine quickly. It is a bit expensive. It would be worth it to buy a cheaper video and then possibly purchase this video if you feel that you are just not being challenged.",1305763200,8,1048,4.346938775510204
3965591,5,B002PNLI38,"This is an Excellent DVD. Fantastic mix of dance, yoga and toning which meets all your needs and means you can vary your routine to prevent boredom. As a Physiotherapist I am impressed with the standard of advise re. exercise provided for all three Trimesters of Pregnancy. Am really enjoying this DVD and gives you confidence to see another very pregnant woman shaking her bod!",1305244800,,378,4.8307692307692305
3965592,5,B002PNLI38,"After much searching for a pregnancy workout I chose this one.  I liked that it not only focused on toning and stretching, but also on preparing for birth with kegal exercises as well as all of the hip movements.  Also she isn't irritating or distracting, but rather calming and easy to follow.  I'm 19 weeks now and plan to keep using this up until my little one is born and after.  It's not too strenuous, but afterward I still feel like I've gotten a good workout and very relaxed after the yoga and relaxation section.  Hooray for a workout that isn't annoying and that I can do without feeling like I'm dying!",1299110400,2,614,4.446428571428571
3965593,2,B002PNLI38,"I bought this because it was the best-rated prenatal fitness DVD. I guess I must be the odd man out, I didn't enjoy it. She makes the workout video mistake of not mirroring her instructions--every other workout DVD I own says the opposite side of what they're doing, understanding that someone watching will mirror their actions. So when she says ""on your right side"" she's actually on her right side, and the person watching is on their left side. Not a big deal, but annoying. She also moves fast at a few points and doesn't explain it well. Personally, I found some of the motions awkward. Also, BEWARE: as of the time I purchased it, the seller does not accept returns except in cases of damage. It's more expensive than most DVDs, so now I have to go through the hassle of reselling it.",1295568000,4,791,4.5
3965594,5,B002PNLI38,my wife bought this at beginning of her second trimester and has alot of fun doing the exercises!  our 3 year old daughter also enjoys doing some of the exercises especially the dancing with her mom.  the dvd also arrived much earlier than expected.,1295136000,,249,4.636363636363637
3965595,5,B002PNLI38,"I found this too late in my pregnancy, but was still able to do a few workouts during my third trimester.  I highly reccomend this.  It has great options for any trimester during your pregnancy.  I tried many other videos and was not near as happy as I was with this one.",1292025600,,271,4.173076923076923
3965596,5,B002PNLI38,This workout is great.  You can customize it to suit your day and/or needs.  I was nervous about getting it because I normally don't like workout DVD's.  This one is great to use before and after pregnancy though.  I love that you don't have to do the same thing every day and the instructor (I've forgotten her name.) isn't at all pretentious.,1291334400,,344,4.5
3965597,5,B002PNLI38,"I had been doing prenatal yoga in a studio and loved it!  But they only had 1 class a week so I needed more.  I purchased a prenatal yoga DVD and it was OK.  But I have to say - at 25+ weeks pregnant and I was really not digging all of the flows - it just didn't quite feel natural to be doing many of the poses - I found myself dreading it and doing it less and less.

THEN I found this DVD.  I have loved it!  I love that the teacher is 34 weeks pregnant at the time of taping - it made me feel great about keeping up on it throughout my pregnancy.  I love how each section can be done alone or together for a longer workout.  I never get bored - the dancing, yoga and strength training all keep me engaged and feeling great.

It feels great on my hips, back and inner thighs- all muscles I need to deliver baby.

I love this DVD and am hoping to use this after the birth of my baby!",1287878400,3,885,3.7868852459016393
3965598,5,B002PNLI38,"I am pregnant with baby #3. I say this because I'm pretty sure I have done all of the workout DVD's the world offers! I tried this one after reading the reviews. What got me is that ladies who were NOT pregnant were using it and loving it! THAT IS A GOOD SIGN. It means that no matter what it's worth it, because it has a longer life span that just your run-of-the-mill prenatal DVD.

I was nervous about doing the dance portion because...well, it's been a LONG time since this mama danced! but there is an instructional on the DVD that goes slowly step by step. The best part about this workout is that it's FUN. AND IT'S A WORKOUT. I sweat. I felt like I got a workout [especially the next day..but in a good way] The music is not annoying, the voice is so sweetly pleasant, and I just felt SO renewed. there are different levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced. And this is a truly customizable workout! [HARD to get from a DVD!]

I HIGHLY recommend this DVD because it is not only easy to follow, but also the techniques really give you a sweat! After doing the workout, I feel extremely satisfied. She is a great instructor!

I did the advanced version of the complete workout, which was just right for me being in the third trimester. I highly recommend it.",1398211200,,270,4.530612244897959
8377144,5,B002PNLI38,"This is a pretty mellow excercise/yoga video, but it is a good addition to a prenatal yoga video library!  I can't dance at all, but it's still fun!",1396396800,,148,4.285714285714286
8377145,1,B002PNLI38,"The background music is an annoying drum.  I found it boring and distracting - not motivating like some upbeat music. Lots of the voice is voiceover attempting a peaceful feel - like Shiva Rea did in her video.  I don't care for that either.  It definitely has a new age feel to it and I was looking for a regular prenatal exercise video without an air of mysticism.  The dance sequence is lots of hip circles and bellydance.

FYI:  The maker/seller (Mommyshape) also does not give full credit for returns.  I returned it after researching, contacting Amazon, and getting the label set-up and was never told that she charges a restocking fee.  I paid for return postage so she still made money on a returned item.  I guess I should have checked her seller page or contacted her, but in the past I have done it all through Amazon with no problem.  shame on me, I guess.",1389657600,,868,4.471337579617835

8377147,2,B002PNLI38,"I should have listened to some of the other reviews. The leader does not do a good job of instructing in my opinion. She gives a lot of great info in the intro section of the DVD but during the routines, she is very hard to follow. Even during stratched she doesn't tell you when to switch sides, when I'm in a full stretch I can't look at the tv too. I mainly purchased this DVD for the dance portion but I was really disappointed with it. There is a dance moves intro on the DVD that I did before I did the dance routine but it was still difficult to follow. She goes really quickly...I usually enjoy when the leader doesn't go slow, but she really goes too fast. I was not happy with any section on the DVD...even the warm up and cool downs were disappointing.
I'll be sticking with Erin O'Brien's prenatal workout, Desi Bartletts Prenantal yoga and Susan Bowen's slim and toned prenatal workout.
So bummed I wasted money on this but that's the chance you take...I even watched a portion of this workout on youtube - I totally blame myself for this bad purchase. Well wishes to all of you workout Mommy's to be :)",1380067200,,1116,4.319047619047619

Awesome DVD set! Would def recommend.",1351468800,,348,4.898305084745763
