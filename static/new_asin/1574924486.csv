195271,1,1574924486,"In my 40 years, there have been about 3 movies that I walked out of.  My wife and the thought of writing this review is the only reason this poor excuse for a movie wasn't the fourth.  Other than havine a submarine and a captain named Nemo, this movie had nothing to do with the book.  Nemo now appears to be a righteous Middle Eastern terrorist of sorts whose kingdom was robbed from him by the ""Armies of the West"".  He is smitten with the professor's daughter, who of course is in love with the no good harpoonist who I am sure will provide for her needs wonderfully and be very supportive of her future research efforts.  Nemo of course keeps the submarine well stocked with makeup, hairdryers, curlers, and dresses, but inexplicably our heroine only manages to find one dress worth wearing for the entire voyage.  Incidentally, the crew is all dressed in uniforms constructed from the silk of some exotic shellfish, unfortunately, the producers couldn't be bothered to show the room containing the first operational deep sea weaving loom for making a variety of fine silk fabrics while cruising beneath the waves.  Amazingly, Ned the harpoonist is now the only man on the ship with enough testosterone to throw a harpoon into a sea monster.  I have a newfound respect for the lifetime of learning it must take to be able to properly through a spear into a large animal at the mind boggling distance of ""four harpoon lengths"".  Also, you'll be intrigued to know that Nemo no longer wrestles with the giant squid, but the new monster du jour is a ""proto-leviathan"" created to prove the theory of ""static evolution"".  Proto-Leviathans apparently look like a giant manta ray, swim at 5000 fathoms beneath the ocean, and somehow manage to keep their mouth full of air while attempting to swallow their underwater prey.

If you long for bad dialog on the level of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", bad science on the level of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", and plot holes big enough for a blue whale to swim through, this is the movie for you.  Don't hesitate!  Click buy it now! I laughed through the entire movie, despite the fact that I don't believe the scriptwriter put a single joke in the movie!",1157673600,26,2202,4.658914728682171
195272,1,1574924486,"This movie is apallingly bad.  I found that it has only a casual resemblance to the Jules Verne novel.  Aside from the Nautilus and Nemo, the rest of the story is made up from scratch, and is not very imaginative. The special effects are lackluster, and obviously cheap CGI work (a la Sci Fi Channel productions).  The story only vaguely resembles the Verne plot, with romance playing a large part of the new interpretation.  The dark soul of Verne's Nemo is lost, as is Nemo's twisted notion of waging war against the nations of the world, to end war and human suffering.  Its on TV enough, along with another similar remake, to avoid buying this sinker.",1156204800,6,655,4.612068965517241
195273,3,1574924486,"Hallmark's version of  Jules' Verne's , 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is entertaining, but suffers from the producer's need to rewrite the story to entertain the widest possible audience.  The character of Conseil was dropped to add a love interest in the form of Arronax's daughter, Sophie.  The squid is gone too- replaced by a monsterous, star wars universe, creature known as a ""proto-leviatian"".  Though lavish by tv-movie standards,  it's obvious that the budget was tight for such an ambitious project.  The characters are adequate, but are too modern in speech and character- Ned Land in particular is just your average jock spouting
such lines as, ""whatever.""  Of particular interest is the Nautilus- the production designer did his homework and attempts to put a true Verne
version on the screen, complete with retractable steering house and
triangular ram.  Unfortuately, darn little of this is seen onscreen and it would have been nice to have been given a minor tour- though the budget may have killed this.  Inside the sub is too modern-and probably
way too large compared to exterior views.  The diving shots are nice and try and convey the beauty of the ocean.  Anyone familiar with a produce section will recognize some very obvious squash and oranges the divers pluck from the sea floor amid some common variety silk plants!  Still, enhanced by a nice music score, it's a nice ride- but if you're only going once- go with the Disney version.",1137369600,8,1458,4.954732510288066
195274,2,1574924486,"I bought this out of sheer chance.  I saw this on sale for $2.99 in the discount rack at Toys R Us who I guess is getting rid of any DVDs that are out of print.  The reason why I say this is because this DVD heavily advertises its URL [...] and that site is dead for sure.  I think Digital Versatile Disc Ltd.  has gone away.

Anyway they have released all sort of cartoons which tie in with famous stories.  Peter Pan, Alice in the Wonderland, and Hercules.  So out of all the releases I felt that 20000 Leagues would have the most action.

The DVD cover (not illustrated on amazon) hardly shows any screen shots of the cartoon.  In fact the cover design is rather inexpensively done.  Which tells me that the artwork done for this is a reprint in itself.

When I turned on the DVD I was suprised to find that the DVD was in DTS.  But dissappointed!  The cartoon is basically Scooby Doo quality!  I have some old Paramount Superman cartoons which have similar animation quality.  I'm delighted to see cheap DVD releases. I have seen the Popeye collection, Japanese Monster Movie collections.  But this one was a dissappointment.

Having said that, if you have a 2-3 yr old child.  This type of DVD would be more ideal than what you see on TV.  There's less violence and definitely a more realism to the story.  Danger verses safe.  Bad verses good.  All the things a child cartoon lacks with its glorification of violence without the consequences of pain or reprecussions.

I give it 2 stars, if this is the right DVD.",1113350400,4,1519,4.423913043478261
195275,5,1574924486,"This version of ""20,000 Leauges Under the Sea"" is very inventive.  Almost like a totally new story based on Jules Verne's book. I personally love this version too.  It's creative and so enjoyable to watch.  I love the action and struggle between good and evil.  The quest to try to be close to perfect, caring and understanding too all creation.  It has some great themes.  I also love how they added the romance between Professor Arronax's daughter  and Captain Nemo and Ned Land.  It's very sweet and endearing. Captain Nemo is very romantic in this version and more caring.  But there's also penty of the original story in it, the main theme is there for freedom and trying to fight humanities injustice's to each other and create a better understanding and more compassionare world. The scene were Ned  fights the sea monster is neat.  I recommend this movie to all ages.  It's am adventure and an exciting film.

I'd also highly recommend the 1950's film with James Mason and Kirk Douglas.  The Disney version.",1106179200,3,1015,4.758620689655173
195276,2,1574924486,Wow! Did this movie stink!!! The writers for this movie should be shot it's so bad! It took real talent to write a screen play so bad that even the fine actor Ben Cross not only couldn't save it but it manages to make him look bad. This movie was schmaltzy and silly and is an insult to Jules Verne's great classic. Don't waste the money to buy this or any of your precious time to watch it. If you do you'll regret it. You'll have more fun spending the night filing your nails.,1104710400,12,478,4.095744680851064
195277,3,1574924486,"Any interpretation of Jules Verne's novel will have limitations.  Mostly, this is due to the fact that our images of his fantastic technologies are colored by our own experience with what would be his future.  Thus, the inside of the Nautilus becomes cheesy (the 1950s Disney version), or too close to reality (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  This film, however, does a good job of tempering Verne's own time with ours.  The ships in the film look very period - including the Nautilus.

Moreover, the story line itself, while modified, does a good job of portraying the complexity of Nemo's character, leaving the viewer (like Professor Aronnax) torn between admiration and disdain.  Yet, this is a television version - thus we see romance and jealousy introduced into the story.  Instead of a faithful servent, the Professor is accompanied by his beautiful daughter (Julie Cox), leading to contention between Nemo and the whaler Ned Land.  If you are a purist, the story changes may be aggravating.

Where this film excels is in the visuals.  Aside from the previously mentioned ships, the underwater shots are great.  My kids really enjoyed the shots of the sea life - cuttlefish, tangs, rays - and were drawn into Nemo's underwater world.

While aspects of the movie were not true to Verne's original tale (and how many are), I found it an entertaining movie.  Moreover, my kids really liked the movie, and wanted to read about Captain Nemo after the movie was over.  I would recommend this DVD.  While my rating is 3 stars, I would give it 3.5 if I could.",1102809600,34,1564,4.849056603773585
195278,2,1574924486,"1997 saw two, count 'em, two TV versions of the classic Jules Verne adventure ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.""  The least literate, this version tosses out much of Verne's loftier discussions of Victorian  science and philosophy and replaces them with watered-down romance of the  drugstore bookrack variety.  Ben Cross is a stone-cold Nemo (how sadly far  we've come from James Mason's tortured nobleman in the 1954 Disney  version), skulking about his steel-plated creation, the Nautilus, with a  seemingly nameless and faceless crew.  Into his nomadic existence comes a  group of castaways, led by the sympathetic, if tired-looking Richard Crenna  as marine biologist Pierre Arronax.  There's also a joyless love-story  between Nemo and Arronax's outspoken daughter (not featured in the book)  that struggles to add emotional fireworks, but simply results in a lurching  distraction from the main plot about Nemo's quest for an end to war and  human strife.  Hammy acting by the supporting cast will make you feel like  this is a movie aimed at kids, even with the story's darker overtones.  About the only aspects of the film that rise above mediocrity are the  production values and special effects.  Though this Nautilus is nowhere  near as imaginative as the Disney version, it is more faithful to the  submarine described in the book, and overall, the look of the film is  suitably impressive.  Still, fans of Jules Verne will likely appreciate the  1954 film version more, even if poor Kirk Douglas is forced to sing. (The  other TV version, by the way, with the usually likeable Michael Caine isn't  much better; dark and murky, it bogs down under the weight of its  pychobabble script.)",964483200,24,1696,5.091240875912408

195307,1,1574924486,"OK, I couldn't watch the whole thing, as much as I wanted to see what a proto-leviathan was, but I stuck it out for well over an hour.

I didn't think I could find any adaptation of a Jules Verne book unwatchable, but this one departed so far from the book and featured such poor and stilted writing and acting it was unwatchable despite superior visuals compared to previous versions.

Only Paul Gross as Ned Land conveyed anything of the original character's personality and the Nemo character as written and acted was a muddled mess, deteriorating into little more than a stalker by the time I quit.  Professor Aronnax was a craven ghost of his original self.",1367798400,,662,4.641025641025641
195308,1,1574924486,"This is one of those so called reimaginings of a great, classic movie.  But it's actually just a very poor retread of a great classic movie.  The acting is lifeless and stilted, as though the actors are just going through the motions.  They don't really seem to understand or care about the characters they are portraying.
If you want to see this movie done right, then see the Walt Disney version (1954).  The actors in this reimagined version don't even come close to the acting abilities and talents of James Mason (who defined the role of Nemo), Kirk Doulglas and Peter Lorre, who make their characters in the Disney version come alive.
The classic look of the Nautilus in the Disney version is also in keeping with the tastes and styles that were popular in the time in which the story is set.

All in all, this other version of that classic movie is a poor imitation and not worth the time or money.",1366934400,,905,4.4939024390243905
195309,4,1574924486,"Following in the footsteps of every Jules Verne Remake of this Timeless Classic comes the Hallmark Channel's retelling of Captain Nemo!

But hey, the TV Movie has wonderful underwater scenes, no nudity or language to really speak of and for the price? Worth adding to your Nemo Collection.

195310,1,1574924486,"First let me confess I never read the book. If the original movie was faithful to the book then this steaming pile must be a love-fest of political correctness. No cannibals, no penal colony and women all over the Nautilus. Don't get me wrong, I love women but the way the PC crowd does things, it's a wonder a movie hasn't been made of a woman named Georgette Washington who masqueraded as a man named George because that was the only way she could lead the Continental Army to victory and become President.

195311,5,1574924486,"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is a visually superb film from 1997.

The story features just four main characters (mainly) - Captain Nemo (Ben Cross - amazing performance throughout, the character's endurance is portrayed superbly), Sophie (Julie Cox - always an amazing performance), the Captain's love interest who is the primary goal of both him & Ned (Paul Gross, playing a wild fisherman) along with Sophie's father, Professor Aronnax (Richard Crenna, playing a marine biologist). The film is an adaptation of the book and though I have not read it - this MADE me want to actually read it someday.

195313,1,1574924486,"This (made for TV?) movie is so horribly bad it rivals the garbage cranked out by the Sci Fi channel.  Perhaps it was one of their efforts?  Everything about this movie is just bad... lackluster special effects, creaky convoluted story, half-hearted acting, etc.  First of all, aside from the title of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Captain Nemo and the Nautilus, the film bears little resemblance to the Jules Verne novel.  I understand that movies based on books are always an adaptation, but this one is a real stretch.  It would almost be better if they changed the name so you wouldn't expect to see Verne's story.  The cast is one of those where they use some B and C list actors with some name value but who are past their prime as far as being able to salvage this sinking wreck of a movie.  Even the 1916 silent 20,000 Leagues is better than this.  The Michael Caine version is also equally as bad.",1293235200,3,906,4.4817073170731705
195314,5,1574924486,I have viewed this item and have added it to my collection of Verne Type films.  Although it strays from the novel it's some what entertaining.

195315,3,1574924486,"Ben Cross and Richard Crenna are both fine actors.  I am never afraid to check out a movie when either one is involved.
Unfortunately, they are not given the proper support from the writer or the director.  This movie covers the basics from the book and Crenna and Cross put in fine performances.  However, the story is spotty at best and the monsters are borderline ridiculous.  Julie Cox (good lord, those eyes!) puts in a decent but largely two-dimensional performance as Aronnox' daughter, an added character that provided romantic tension between Ned Land and Nemo.

Three travelers fell overboard from their ship. They are rescued, or captured, by the 'Nautilus', a submersible ship. [The interior of this ship shows an unbelievable amount of space!] They meet Nemo, the captain of this extraordinary ship. He tells them how they live off the sea. Nemo explains its replenishable power source. The conversations bring out the characters of the people.

They don special suits to travel underwater and observe life beneath the sea, where no man has gone before. Their electric guns drive away sharks. They use a speaking tube for communication. Nemo was a victim of Western imperialism and hopes to regain freedom for his country. Can Nemo's knowledge aid the suffering of humanity? At sea the 'Nautilus' is attacked by the USS Abraham Lincoln. [Too much irony?] There is an attack on the ship by a giant leviathan. Can they defeat this strange creature? Ned uses his harpoon and an explosive device to save the ship. Captain Nemo releases Dr. Aranax, his daughter Sophie, and Ned so they can return to land.

Films are the condensed and simplified versions of the novels they are taken from. You may prefer to read the original story of Jules Verne than this modified version. I suspect the political comments were toned down or omitted.",1204588800,,1440,4.849593495934959
195317,1,1574924486,"Without writing you a novel, let me just say this film is terrible. Below are a few reasons why I equate ""terrible"" with this Allumination/Hallmark version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

(1) If this film was meant to accurately tell Jules Verne's novel, the viewer would never know it. For starters, ""Where is Conseil?"" ""Why a daughter to Professor Aronnax?"" and ""Why pit Captain Nemo against Ned Land to win the love of Sophia (Aronnax's daughter)?""

(2) If the viewers are supposed to feel sorry for Captain Nemo, they won't. When Captain Nemo sinks Admirable Farragut's ship, I felt sorry for the Admirable and his crew. [In short, Captain Nemo reminds me of a demented terrorist.]

(3) To include a ""love story,"" this film leaves out many of the most exciting parts of Jules Verne's novel, replacing them with Proto-Leviathans.

(4) The wardrobe was POOR (and who heard of silk uniforms). There were many inconsistencies between reality and what was shown on screen including the occasion where only Ned Land's harpoon (being thrown into the Proto-Leviathan) could save them from dying from lack of oxygen.
