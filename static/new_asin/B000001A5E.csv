1175142,5,B000001A5E,"I've never been able to warm to most of Fellini's ""classic"" films: a few memorably imaginative sequences lost in a deluge of party scenes and idle chit-chat.  ""La Strada,"" however, is a remarkable and beautiful accomplishment.  Giulietta Masina's lovable conflation of Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx is both endearing and moving; rarely has a simple-minded but good-hearted character been portrayed with such sensitivity.  Anthony Quinn is equally fine in his own way, and the film makes a strong impression that is not easily forgotten, even days (or years) later.  Just wonderful.",980208000,14,582,5.362637362637362
1175143,5,B000001A5E,"This is Federico Felleni's masterpiece. It is much more accesible than  many of his other films, and although most of them are wonderful movies in  their own right, this one exceeds them. This is the only Felleni film, and  one of the only films ever, where I was so deeply moved that I was in tears  by the last scene. To understand this movie is to gain great insight into  the fragile human condition. We watch as the innocent, beautiful-faced  Gelsomina slowly teaches the brutal Zampano how to love. But tragically,  once he learns, it is too late, and he has destroyed the only chance for  companionship and love he had ever been given. The film is so simple and  powerful, one cannot help but feel compassion for the young Gelsomina, pity  for the Fool, and in the end, terrible sorrow for the utterly helpless and  lonely man Zampano becomes.",968371200,7,850,4.6
1175144,5,B000001A5E,"One of the best films you'll ever see. Anthony Quinn is great as a small time circus performer going from city to city performing his same routine of breaking a chain for handouts from the crowd. He buys Gelsomina from a  poor distraught family who previously sold him another daughter Rosa who  died recently. Gelsomina is an irresistable, cute, Charlie Chaplin-like  assistant to the brutish Zampano, who views her as a necessary part of his  trade, but treats her coldly. His cruelty is highlighted when in one town  he treats her to a nice supper, but then picks up a voluptuous girl right  in front of her and rides off leaving Gelsomina behind. When the pair come  upon a traveling circus, the trouble starts between Zampano and Richard  Basehart as ""The Fool"". The fool taunts Zampano into a flying  rage that... This is movie-making at it's best. Do not miss this  masterpiece.",967420800,9,885,4.7631578947368425
1175145,5,B000001A5E,"I first saw LA STRADA within a few years of its original release.  I still remember how I felt when I saw Gelsomina's face and heard her play her few melancholy notes on the violin.  Almost fifty years later I can still see  that face and hear those notes.  I have to admit that I'd never heard of  Federico Felini or his wife, Giulietta Masina.  I didn't know that, in  time, LA STRADA would be labeled a work of genius.  I did know, by the way  that it affected me, that I had been exposed to something exceptional.  I  pictured myself as a pretty macho guy back then, and I wasn't supposed to  walk out of a movie theater with tears in my eyes.  Luckily, no one saw me  when I did.
For most of the movie, I wanted to take Gelsomina in my arms  and protect her.  I wanted to wrap a piece of Zampano's chain around his  neck and strangle him with it.  I wanted to grab ""The Fool"" by  the shoulders and shake him and tell him, ""If you keep taunting that  bully he's going to make you pay for it.""
Poor Gelsomina, I couldn't  do a thing for her.  ""The Fool"" was really a fool for not heeding  my silent warnings and it cost him his life.  As for Zampano, he would have  been better off if I could have strangled him.  His pain, a result of the  pain he had caused, was worse than any punishment I could have dealt  out.
My criteria as to what makes a movie great is a very personal one.  It's also a very simple one.  I don't look for multiple layers of symbolism  or any other intellectual gobbledygook.  It's how I react emotionally.  On  that score, LA STRADA is right up there at the top of my list.",960940800,113,1602,4.077669902912621
1175146,5,B000001A5E,"First of all I have to admit Fellini's one of my favorite directors. Not only his films, but his lifestyle is so sympathic. I love him. He was a genius. La Strada, is one of his earlier films but still the greatest. I'm  not saying that  other Fellini films are not great but I think this is his  best. Giulietta Masina, Fellinis wife and Anthony Quinn are the greatest  duo in film history. The atmosphaere of the film is wonderful and still  depresing. That is Fellinis style. I think everyone should see this film.  It's a great classic.",959212800,5,540,4.459183673469388

1175148,5,B000001A5E,"I saw this movie when I was in college almost twenty years ago.  I have seen it only once, but I remember what it meant to me. After simpathizing with Ms. Massini's character, with the Fool and hating Zampano since the  beginig of the movie, I found myself amazed to feel sorry for him at the  very end when he receives what he deserves, loneliness and emptyness.
I  cried not only for him, but for all of us, that sooner or later will face  that moment, with relief or with remorse.
In a way maybe her love did  save and redempt him; just a litlle too late.
When I got into DVD world,  I sweared I'll never buy a VHS; but this movie it's an exception to the  rule.

1175158,5,B000001A5E,"DVD transfer:  Excellent B&W.  Criterion has done their usual standard-setting restoration and printing.

I'm not real sure who should get the most credit for La Strada; writer-director Frederico Fellini or his wife and lead actress, Guilietta Masina.  Fellini's vision of modern bondage set a midst a traveling carnival show gives us both the depths of human behavior and the almost impossible emergence of love within human squalor.  While it's obvious Fellini was influenced by the Italian neo realism movement, this film should not be considered as part of that movement.  True, the sets are hard and realistic location setups, adding to the rough and overbearing nature of the circus strongman, Zampano (Anthony Quinn), who buys an assistant, Gelsomina (Guilietta Masina) from a starving family but the themes depart from realism enough to keep it out of that genre..

The relationship between Zampano and Gelsomina drives the story and it's not one which will please the audience.  There's a love story here but it's anything but typical.  It's love that's marked by jealousy, brutality and insensitivity.  As the story progresses, we see Gelsomina become infatuated with a clown (Richard Basehart) which drives an otherwise oblivious Zampano to murder.  The crestfallen Gelsomina begins a decline in spirit that culminates with her death.  It's then, and only then, that we see love crack the almost unbreakable hide of the tough and callous, Zampano.

The performance of Guilietta in La Strada, for me at least, has to be one of the top 10 best of all time.  Her use of an almost mime-driven style to help express a wide range of human frailty and love is a wonder to behold.  Sub-titles become worthless and unnecessary.  If you want to see an actress practice her art at its highest level, then La Strada is the film for you.

Recommended for those over 17 only based on themes beyond the interest or understanding of the young.  If you buy only 1 foreign language film in your lifetime, make it La Strada.",1450828800,6,2016,4.967164179104477
1175159,5,B000001A5E,"This is so different from the other, later, Fellini movies that I've seen -- ""Amarcord"" and ""La Dolce Vita"" -- that I was quite surprised.  The later two are satirical exposes of the shortcomings of post-war Italian masculinity; this earlier one, although set in post-war Italy too, strikes me as much more humanely involving and, at the same time, almost mythic in its clear schematic structuring.  The bare bones of the story are of a rather brutish itinerant entertainer called Zampano (Anthony Quinn), who travels around the countryside giving displays of strength to small crowds in provincial towns who are willing to see him break iron chains by flexing his pectoral muscles.  He's a bit like Canio in ""Pagliacci"" in his volatility and potential for violence.  At times, he hooks up with small circuses and does his act as part of the circus's entertainment.  His female partner has died (we learn as the story opens), and Zampano in effect buys her sister Gelsomina (Guilietta Masini) from their mother as a replacement.  This is the first hint of the economic stringencies of post-war Italy, looked at from the point of view of a class well below what we see in the later films mentioned above, and it is to that class that Zampano and the small circuses that he joins with appeal.  Gelsomina is simple-minded, to use an old-fashioned phrase that seems right for the time of the film, but she's sweet, and she discovers, as she travels around, a talent for attracting and appealing to audiences with what seems like almost a Chaplinesque, ""little tramp"" kind of shtick.  Zampano needs that talent -- for she is, in effect, his way of attracting a paying audience -- and yet seems to resent the easy rapport that Gelsomina establishes, and he treats her brusquely and sometimes cruelly.  Things come to a head when Gelsomina attracts the attention of ""Il Matto,"" -- a clown or ""fool"" played by Richard Baseheart -- who combines jesting with tightrope-walking and violin-playing.  He is associated in the film with a poignant little musical phrase that he teaches Gelsomina to play and which becomes associated with her.  Matto, unfortunately for him, constantly pokes fun at Zampano, and Zampano doesn't take it well.  For all that, it becomes clear that, much as Gelsomina likes Matto and shares his whimsy, she has come to care for Zampano, and given chances to leave him, she does not.  I'll say no more in the interests of not spoiling plot developments for readers who might not have seen the film.

What's striking about all this is the economy of the script and the fact that most of what I've described above is communicated through movement and gesture.  These are NOT articulate characters -- they emphatically don't ""talk through"" their problems, and one doubts that they even could, and Gelsomina is simple anyway.  But beyond the dynamics of character interaction, there's a sense of Gelsomina's responsiveness to the natural and even spiritual dimensions of life.  She is associated with the sea -- and the movie opens and closes with sea images -- and she's also responsive to not just Matto's violin but to the simple ceremony of a religious parade that she encounters in one of the villages.  Her responsiveness to these things is communicated largely wordlessly, but Fellini's attention to Masini's look and gestures makes it clear.  It would be going too far to simply allegorize Zampano and Gelsomina as body and spirit respectively, but in the film's schematization, the contrast trends in that direction, and Gelsomina's unselfconscious playfulness is connected to this hint of the ""holy fool"" that is part of the way she's represented.  Anthony Quinn's Zampano isn't a graceful mover, as Gelsomina is, but the ways of movement, their ways of using their physical resources, push the film in the direction of dance as an expressive medium, especially given the deliberate paucity of the language.  The performances seem to me outstanding -- Quinn, Masini, and Baseheart seem to give themselves completely to Fellini's conception, and the conclusion is very affecting.  The filming in black-and-white seems apt too for the scheme, and it looks very good, even when what it's looking at is painful to contemplate.  Great film!",1447286400,,4254,4.985855728429986

1175167,5,B000001A5E,"La Strada (1954) was the first of what Federico Fellini expert Peter Bondanella calls his `Trilogy of salvation or grace', the other two being Il Bidone (1955) and The Nights of Cabiria (1957). In all three films characters undergo a huge cyclical journey through life where they end up where they started having learned something important on the way. Fellini was ambivalent about organized religion and got into hot water with the Catholic Church on more than one occasion, but the use of the word 'salvation' or `grace' implies some kind of religious program and Fellini is on record as saying Jesus Christ was ""the greatest person in the history of the human race"" and that ""he continues to live on in anyone who sacrifices himself for his neighbor."" Indeed he saw all his early films turn on this idea, especially the ones involving his wife Giulietta Masina - ""a little creature who wants to love and who lives for love."" Please note this is a thematic review and so contains spoilers.

Many great films are also the simplest and La Strada (The Road) is a textbook example. A masterpiece as great as they come, the film is the deeply moving story of a journey made by two characters from one beach to another and what happens on the road in between. Zampan (Anthony Quinn seizing the role of his lifetime) is a brutish street-performing strongman whose Neanderthal act consists of breaking an iron chain wrapped around him by flexing his chest muscles. He travels through run down backwater towns and villages on his motorbike cum trailer performing and squandering his measly earnings on booze and whores. Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina astounding the world in the role that made her) is the simple girl bought into slavery at the film's outset by Zampan. What she lacks intellectually is made up for by special abilities. She knows how to talk to children, animals and even plain objects. She has an affinity with nature, knows when it's going to rain, listens to trees and seems especially at home on the beach. A cross between Charlie Chaplin, Harpo Marx and any one of the Franciscan monks depicted in Fellini's script by Roberto Rossellini in Francis, God's Jester and even photographed against a wall with a poster reading ""Immaculate Madonna,"" she clearly represents `goodness' and `love' as opposed to Zampan who represents `badness' and `hate'. The two are conduits for the human condition and as they travel and work together (she learning to beat a drum, play the trumpet and even dance a little for her dissolute master's ridiculous act) they profoundly affect one another.

At first there is a curious balance between the two, his brutality highlighted against her vulnerability and vice versa. There is even comedy as she adapts to her new life on the road, performing on streets, at a wedding, taking in a religious procession, a circus and an overnight stay in a convent. Things darken when they encounter a third character, the Fool (a beautiful role for Richard Basehart). He's presented as a combination of Gelsomina's Christian saintliness and Zampan's brute atheism. First seen as a tightrope artist with angel wings performing above the street on a high wire, he relates an important parable to Gelsomina on the ultimate meaning of life which convinces her to stay with Zampan. Picking up a stone he says, ""I don't know what purpose this pebble serves, but it must serve some purpose. Because if it is useless, then everything is useless."" Gelsomina is the pebble whose purpose in life is to support her master. However, the Fool is just as much Lucifer as he is Gabriel. Despite his `goodness' he resembles Zampan all the same. Another circus performer with his own act, he spitefully insults Zampan for no good reason and when pushed into a corner his answer is the same as that of his nemesis: ""I'm happy alone. I don't need anyone!"" Both think they can survive without neighbors, without love. Towards the end of the film the whole narrative turns on Zampan and Gelsomina's chance encounter with the Fool on an isolated mountain road. Instead of demonstrating Christian love for his neighbor by helping him fix his car, Zampan takes revenge and accidentally kills him instead. The act also kills something inside Gelsomina and she loses her sanity. Time passes and Zampan loses patience with his now listless assistant. He abandons her on the roadside while she's asleep. Five years later he's back on the coast, possibly at the same beach resort where the film started. He overhears a woman singing the tune Gelsomina used to play on her trumpet and learns that his old assistant had been taken in by a kind family, but was mad and died soon after. Zampan reacts to type by getting drunk. Finding himself alone on a deserted beach late at night he looks up at the stars and finally his feelings overtake him and he bursts into wretched tears as Gelsomina's tune overwhelms the soundtrack. For all his macho bluster, he needs someone after all, the film finishing on an extraordinary gush of emotion made even more compelling by the complete absence of any sentimentality.

As I have described the film here it might seem that the film is a religious polemic. Almost every key scene has a Christian element to it - the priest at the wedding, the religious procession Gelsomina witnesses and where she is labeled ""Immaculate Madonna"", the Fool as an angel reading her the sermon of the pebble, the overnight stay in the convent where the nuns invite Gelsomina to stay forever. We could say that she receives her spiritual vocation through the Fool's sermon and that Zampan receives his `salvation' through the reception of `grace' which Gelsomina provides through her 'sacrifice'. However, to break the film down to one reading would be to rob it of its richness. Certainly a Christian reading is possible, but in the final scene on the beach it is unclear if Zampan is saved or not and we must accept the film is open to numerous other interpretations. From a neo-realist angle we could accept the closing scene as simply an expression of his more prosaic guilty conscience having inflicted so much pain throughout the film. Remorse is there, but no certain promise that he will change as `redemption' implies. Much of the film does stay within the neo-realist remit. The film is about working class people set against harsh impoverished surroundings, features many amateurs playing in small roles (though none of the principals), stresses the importance of simply earning enough to eat and reflects Gelsomina's plight through the reactions of children (aka Rome Open City and Visconti's La terra trema). The film's intense poetry and obvious Christian themes however contradict any left-wing concern with the common man, and the film got Fellini into trouble at the Venice Film Festival for making poetry out of poverty and betraying the neo-realist's Marxist remit. La Strada may not be neorealist in total, but it certainly is as 'neo-realist' as it is 'Christian'.

The film can also be read as a parable on the impossibility of communication in the modern world and in married life in particular. Some see it as an analysis of Fellini's own marriage to Masina. The director had a nervous breakdown and was in psychotherapy during the film's completion and perhaps Zampan represents the beast that rages within which dominates his wife completely on some psychosexual level. This raises the possibility of a feminist reading which some have linked with the much later Juliet of the Spirits (1965). Masina herself intriguingly advanced the idea that the film's three main characters (the Fool, the simpleton and the brute) all represent different facets of her husband's psyche. I guess most people will accept the film more as an existential depiction of `man' and `woman' (the veritable `Beauty and the Beast') locked into marriage and embarked on a Homeric road of discovery which symbolizes life itself. Though it's underplayed in the film, Zampan does rape Gelsomina (graphically described in the soggetto) and they do become a couple. The experiences they have, both good and bad, her running away, her return, then her commitment to support her husband can be boiled down to married life writ large. The man is depicted as a raging bull throughout the film and Martin Scorsese picked up on this when he made his boxing epic about Jake la Motta. We can perhaps parallel Quinn on the beach at the end with De Niro breaking down in his prison cell having blown everything through impotent macho rage which simply will not calm down. Perhaps La Strada's ambiguity is most apparent in the use of Nino Rota's music, especially the so-called 'Gelsomina theme'. Actually the theme doesn't belong to her. It is shared between all three main characters. We first hear it played on the violin by the Fool in the circus tent shortly before he reads Gelsomina the parable of the pebble. The theme is linked with the parable's point - an expression of Gelsomina's meaning in life embodied in staying with Zampan. The theme stays with her until this meaning is broken with the Fool's murder. We next hear it sung by the woman and overheard by Zampan and by the time it gets its full orchestral treatment on the beach in the final scene it has become 'Zampan's theme'. This suggests that the music represents an emotion rather than a person, most obviously (though not only) the emotion of love - love for one's neighbor, one's master, one's husband and finally, one's wife. And of course this love is deeply ambiguous as music is the most ambiguous of all the arts. The love could be sacred or it could be secular, but the most important thing for the greatness of this film is that a precise meaning cannot be pinned down. Matters of theme apart, ultimately what really impresses (or at least what I take away from this film the most) are the deeply moving performances of Quinn and Masina and the extraordinary emotional charge which sears through the film with such power. Fellini went into to make a couple of films as good as this, but none better.

Potential buyers should be aware that this film is available in a 3 DVD boxed set from Optimum World/Studio Canal which also includes The White Sheik (1952) and The Nights of Cabiria (1957). I picked mine up for just 9 making it an outstanding bargain. The transfer quality of all three films is excellent, pristine b/w pictures and clear sound. Early Fellini is unmissable for lovers of cinema and buying this set is a no-brainer even if you already have La Strada and just want to have the other two.",1424649600,4,10582,4.84742951907131

1175178,5,B000001A5E,"""La Strada"" is an Italian drama from the 1950s about a young woman sold to a traveling circus act, the great strongman Zampano; portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Quinn. La Strada is masterfully-told. The young woman, a fragile, delicate performer, falls in love with Zampano, although he's such a scumbag to her.

The film really picks up when the two meet a traveling clown as part of the Rome circus. The clown, known as The Fool, runs afoul of Zampano. The ensuing action is both tragic, and deeply moving.",1407024000,,508,4.7727272727272725

1175186,4,B000001A5E,"""La Strada"" is one of Federico Fellini's most well known and well loved movies. It has received numerous praises and reviews from critics all over the world and in fact won the very first Academy Award in 1956 for Best Foreign Film. I have to say I can't compare this film to any of the other films that Fellini has made because at the time of writing this review ""La Strada"" is the only movie by Fellini I have seen. Having seen this film however I can give my comment and review on ""La Strada"" and I say this is a great picture that knows how to touch the soul of the viewer and bring that viewer into the world of Gelsomina, Zampano and ""the Fool"".

Made in 1954 ""La Strada"" is a realistic look at post war Italy the same way ""The Bicycle Thief"" also did. It is a country trying to find a way back from the economic depression it suffered after the end of the Second World War. Trying to scrape together money anyway they could to exist Zampano found his as a kind of traveling sideshow going all around the countryside as a strongman who can break apart iron chains using his chest muscles. Zampano, played by Anthony Quinn, is in a sense a one trick pony. He has no other skill or trade to help make money or find a job but he does make enough with his performances to survive. Zampano is also a man who only lives by one emotion, anger. That is pretty much how he is throughout the whole movie. Zampano lusts for and desires all the wine, money and women that pleases him but the sad thing is he gets no pleasure from life nor does he seem to want it. He just tries to satisfy his needs then moves on to the next town to perform for the people there. Anthony Quinn gives one of his most outstanding performances as an actor in this film. I would rate it right up there with ""Zorba The Greek"" and ""Shoes Of The Fisherman"" as some of his best work.

The surprise for me in this film was Richard Basehart playing the part in ""La Strada"" called The Fool. I have always known Basehart as Captain Nelson in TVs ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" or as Ismael in the movie version of ""Moby Dick"". I had never seen him acting in a foreign film before but he gives a lively performance as The Fool and Zampano's antagonist. They both know each other from their past though just how they know each other is not explained in any way but there is no uncertainty on the part of the viewer that Zampano hates The Fool and The Fool just can't pass up an opportunity to needle and make fun of Zampano. The tension between the two heightens when they both join a traveling circus. I won't say anymore what will take place between the two as to not give away too much about the story for the benefit of those who have not seen the picture.

The true gem acting in this film is Giulietta Masina who plays Gelsomina. Masina steals the show with her acting performance. She is a young girl with no worldly experience. She is not very smart but is pretty in a plain sort of way and has a heart of gold. At the beginning of the film Gelsomina lives at home with her mother and four younger sisters. Her older sister Rosa was working for Zampano as his assistant until she suddenly dies. Zampano come to see Gelsomina's mother to offer her money to buy in a sense Gelsomina to take Rosa's place in the act. Gelsomina doesn't want to go with Zampano but knowing her family could use the money Zampano is offering agrees to go with him. It is hard for Gelsomina to get use to the brutish ways of Zampano but she does start to develop feelings for him including love. Love though is something Zampano doesn't have any of and continues to use Gelsomina to take care of his needs including taking over as Zampano's assistance during his performances.

This will not be a movie with a feel good kind of ending but it is a movie that will play on your emotions. For anyone who considers themselves a fan of foreign movies this is one foreign movie that will not disappoint. For those who tend to stay away from foreign movies out of fear they will be bored by such kind of films I say give ""La Strada"" a chance. The acting, writing and photography in this film is so first rate you may find yourself being caught up in the lives of the three main characters and intrigued by the plot as it goes along. It could even change your opinion about foreign movies!",1376179200,,4331,4.252427184466019
1175187,5,B000001A5E,"Every ten years or so, I get out my Fellini films and take the familiar journey which begins in the devastation and poverty of post-wwII Italy, through the phenomenal explosion of the Italian recovery during the 50's, then into the psychedelic 60s and beyond.  And during the journey, 'La Strada' stands out.  In a way, it encapsulates the entire Fellini universe -- grim neo-realism, moments of magic, dreams, virtuoso extravagance, defeat... then, at the end, surrender to an almost unbearable emotional force.  For most people, 'La Strada' is the pinnacle Fellini experience.  I see it as but a single peddle in the road, but like the one Gelsomina  choses for herself, it's an enormously important, enormously personal pebble.

The main character is a traveling street performer who lives off tips.  His assistant is played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina who portrays a pixie-like character and has a special allure without being exceedingly attractive.

The film was made in 1954 and shows things like the poverty of small-town Italy before its later economic recovery and how easy it was to cover up a homicide with a staged car accident before modern police forensics.  But the main attraction of the film is its compelling story and its visual images.  It is Fellini's best film and won an Oscar for best foreign film in 1956.

1175193,5,B000001A5E,"Although I am not well versed in Italian cinema or neorealism, I enjoyed his film and have watched it almost a dozen times. I admire the barren landscapes and the score that builds the atmosphere for this film. Its protagonists are Zampano, Gilsomina, and a Fool. In the beginning, Zampano buys Gelsomina from an impoverished mother after announcing to her the death of another of her daughters he previously bought. Zampano goes on the road performing an act of brutal strength, that is to break chains only with his chest, and he takes Gilsomina, a girl that may be retarded or too withdrawn to be considered entirely normal, to assist him and even to be his sexual partner. The relationship that Zampano develops with Gilsomina is characterized by the same brute force that he uses to impress his audiences. Later, Zampano and Gilsomina will meet with the Fool, and the audience will discover that there is an existing animosity between the two which the Fool manages to exacerbate to its tragic outcome. However, the interaction between these three characters and the constant presence of a hungry audience along with the barren landscapes mentioned before are what governs this film. The score is done by Nino Rota, who did the famous score for the Godfather (I looked it up). This is not a typical Hollywood film, but a completely new experience in film watching.

This particular Criterion disc is better than other counterparts because it has the film in Italian and in English with subtitles. I confess that I have watched the film every time in Italian even if I have to read the subtitles in English.

1175198,4,B000001A5E,"La Strada gets 3 stars, simply because the subtitles are not in English, so I never really know what is being said.  But I certainly get the gist of it; because the actors are so remarkable in their roles.  In fact, by this review, you can see I got quite a bit out of it.  I probably missed stuff, too, as I don't understand Italian and the subtitles are in Spanish, I think.  ANYWAY...  it's worth watching and figuring it out...

Anthony Quinn is a brutish pestilence of a man (Zampano) who has his one man traveling strong man show, and he comes back to the household of his first 'assistant'  (who had died) and gets another assistant in the form of a very child-like young woman, Gelsomina (I think that's the spelling; I don't have the DVD with me).

The two are a jarring contrast of good and bad; the ugly part of the world and the sweet part.  Zampano finds the need to continue to bully and brutalize Gelsomina, even when she's perfectly accommodating.  She begins to like being in his show, but the more she sees his immoral side (he sleeps with other women) and his predator side (he steals from a convent of nuns who offer them shelter and food) she feels her own goodness (and hope for a good life) is threatened, and she grows more and more sad.  She brings up the subject of getting married, which Zampano dismisses.  He'd taken her body against her will--yet still she tries to love him because of it, but she concludes he is a brute and runs away from him.  He finds her, hits her and makes her truly fear him, and forces her to go with him again.  She doesn't want to be like Zampano but is forced to love him more by circumstance if not by choice.

When Zampano kills a man in a rage, and forces Gelsomina to assist him in covering up the crime, she slides off into near-imbicility of guilt--almost catatonic.  Zampano is spooked by her behavior and finds her a liability and leaves her on a snowy pass when she's sleeping.  Years later, he discovers that she simply grieved away and died.  Zampano goes to the beach at night and seems to have a revelation that he'd been the one to kill her and weeps.

Directed in the 1950s by Fellini, the film is raw in black and white post war Italy; shabby, weary people almost addled by post-war conditions.  They seem to behave childishly during a wedding scene of food fights and mauling the bride.  The only bright firefly of light in all of this grim reality is the almost fairy-like Gelsomina.  She can't possibly survive under this coarse captivity of post-war Italy and the people in it--especially with Zampano.  She is considered a 'fey' young woman--fated to die.  (Wikipedia backs me up on that one.  Fey young women are a favorite of Victorian literature)

The music is memorable; the little tune she plays on the trumpet is sweet and melancholy.  The story is simple and downward spiraling, but Gelsomina never betrays her goodness, even in death.

Haunting film.  Again... I wish it had English subtitles.  Even so, I find it a fine film to watch.",1320796800,2,3022,4.481684981684982

She's strong and at the same time weak, she's joyful yet at the same time sad. Her complexity as an actress is unmatched and i really think that she is the greatest actress to have ever lived. In La Strada, she performs a role that has been revered as the ""female charlie Chaplin."" I thought she was adorable in this film even thought she plays a role that is the complete opposite of Nights of Cabiria. Here she is aloof and ""not all there"" in the head. Her joy is based on the happiness of her master played by Anthony Quinn. This is a chracter piece, so those that want a film that has a point a to point b story should look elsewhere.

1175208,5,B000001A5E,"The face in question belongs to the enchanting Giulietta Masina. And the movie is LA STRADA (1954), director Federico Fellini's haunting tale about the strange relationship between an innocent young waif and the boorish circus performer who takes her under his wing.

LA STRADA (""The Road"") is one of the watershed movies of Italian cinema, and also launched the international careers of director Federico Fellini and his actress wife Giulietta Masina in the process. Amongst many accolades, the movie walked away with the 1956 Academy Award for 'Best Foreign Language Film'.

The story is one of the most haunting, heartbreaking ones you'll ever encounter; it will remain in your soul long after the credits have rolled. A charming, somewhat backward waif named Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) is plucked from her carefree family home on the seashore and placed into the employment of Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a vagabond circus strong-man. Complications arise when Zampano's old adversary, a highwire artist named 'The Fool' (Richard Basehart) returns to the scene. What follows will prove fateful for the trio...

The heartrending performance of Giulietta Masina is pure perfection. Every glance, facial expression, physical gesture shows us exactly what is happening inside the head and heart of this most magical, haunting screen character. The audience goes along for the same emotional ride that the character of Gelsomina does. Federico Fellini fashioned this film as a showcase for his talented wife. Acclaimed performances in ""Nights of Cabiria"" and ""Juliet of the Spirits"" would follow in later years, and while Masina was always superbly good in anything she did, LA STRADA was and forever will be her best ever screen performance.

Zampano is a totally unsavoury character and the audience is never meant to find any kind of sympathy toward him. The most challenging, thankless assignment for any actor is to play such a character, but Anthony Quinn delivers what he can given the limits of the material. Richard Basehart is a lovely presence as 'The Fool', one of the lone adult characters who actually seems to care for the neglected Gelsomina. The musical score by Nino Rota is likewise so very haunting, particularly ""Gelsomina's Theme"" which recurs throughout the second half of the film.

If you want a film which illustrates--so movingly--the sheer joy and heartbreak of simply being alive, you must see LA STRADA. I guarantee you'll never be the same...",1291334400,3,2470,5.243037974683545

comments brief.  I love this movie.  I found Giulietta Masina's
performance as Gelsomina subtle, yet powerfull.  Anthony Quinn's
performance fits the role well, without the overbearing presence
found in many of his performances, so don't let his inclusion as
a lead actor turn you away; his performance is spot on.

The film tells a hauntingly poignant story of the development of
a relationshiop between the one man traveling circus played by Quinn,
and his acquired sidekick of Gelsomina.  I won't give away the
ending other than to say that it was deeply emotional and
very satisfying.  This movie set me thinking about life and

powerful messages and subtly provocative questions presented.

I imagine however that it is a movie that you either love or hate;
there are likely few inbetweener's.  The performances in this movie
are excellently understated, and it is a moving story.

1175214,5,B000001A5E,"One of the finest films ever made; `La Strada' is a magnificent feat in cinema.  I have been a fan of Federico Fellini ever since seeing the magnificent `8 ', but I must confess that `La Strada' is the best film I've seen from him and the one that will continue to shake me for years to come.  A beautiful, yet tragic tale of love and ignorance, and love IN ignorance, `La Strada' is a priceless portrayal of ones inability to transcend their own ingrained survival instincts and embrace what is right in front of their face; love.

The film seems like a simple tale.  Gelsomina is the eldest child in a poor single parent family who is sold to Zampano, a muscle-bound sideshow act who had previously purchased Gelsomina's sister (who is now deceased).  Gelsomina is a simple girl, not too intelligent and completely nave to the way of the world.  Zampano is not much different though, even if he seems it.  He too is a simple man, but he is less ignorant when it comes to the world and more ignorant when it comes to human relationships.  He seems on the outset to be cruel and demanding, but he is merely acting in the only way he understands, most likely the way he was treated as a child.  He thus treats Gelsomina, not as a lover or a wife but as a child, disciplining her with beatings and putting her down, constantly controlling her.  When one really dissects his actions though, they are clearly expressions of love gone terribly wrong.

Unlike the `monsters' created in cinema today to express the severity of spousal abuse, Zampano is far from a monster.  He is a confused and conditioned man, lacking the ability to break his shell and better himself.

Gelsomina is your typical victim, but her stunted comprehension of society's workings makes her almost a victim of herself.  She finds herself thrust into a world that she is not privy to, and instead of learning to adapt she forcibly resists, or just cowers in cowardice.  She lacks the drive to find herself, even though she is given the perfect opportunity to become her own person.  When she does attempt to make those steps she backs down at the first sign of opposition, which leads her to coil back even further into the shell she builds to protect her from harm.

The one thing that I think cannot be argued, but so frequently is, is the fact that Zampano and Gelsomina are in love.  I know that this may seem odd and maybe even impossible when one looks at the events taking place, but events must be considered in context, and context to me proves that these two were ignorant in their own understanding of love, thus they acted foolishly and tragically in the name of a feeling they were too prideful, and maybe even stupid, to acknowledge.  I don't want to get into much of the film, and especially not the ending, but when one watches the film I think it is important to look at the unseen as much as the seen.  The actors do a masterful job of exposing their character's inner motives without really exposing them, keeping up a guard and making you wonder.

When that guard is broken down by the discerning viewer a completely different conclusion can be drawn.

The performances are all brilliant, especially Giulietta Masina who is startling as Gelsomina.  Her almost speechless performance is elevated by her ability to convey so much with her face (that cute little artichoke).  She has an almost theatrical quality that really fits the tone of the film well (beings that the circus is a major theme) and so it shows that she was observant of her character's surroundings and incorporated them into her performance.  Anthony Quinn is also stunning as Zampano, giving him a layer of almost undetectable vulnerability (like I said, the unseen).  I also really enjoyed Richard Basehart's jovial portrayal of Il Matto, Zampano's circus rival.  His character is really one of the most challenging to discern, but when one finds their impression of the man then, and only then, can they understand their feelings of Zampano and Gelsomina.  He is really the crux in their relationship, and ones impression of Il Matto greatly influences their impressions of the two leads.

This film is truly an outstanding cinematic accomplishment and rests easily at the top of my personal favorite films of all time.  It is beautifully shot, expertly paced, crisply directed, brilliantly acted and, above all else, marvelously written.  It covers all of it's bases in a way that many films cannot.

This one is definitely essential!",1255046400,31,4495,4.7011494252873565

What makes this movie so special are the two main characters, who deliver a tremendous performance. In addition, the movie is made in black and white, with harsh and sharp contours; a feeling of loneliness permeates the visuals, the actions and the dialogues. One scene jumps out that underscores the sadness of the story. As Zampano buys an icecream at a little stall towards the end of the movie, he doesn't lick at the cone. Instead he pushes it into his mouth and swallows it completely, without stopping to taste it. It is visuals like this that turn this movie into such a strong account of suffering people, lost in a harsh, lonely world.",1252454400,2,819,4.655172413793103
1175217,5,B000001A5E,"This rather bleak picture of human nature is obscured by the mixed feelings we see Director Federico Fellini bestow upon the wretched characters in this intense black and white 1954 Italian film.  The simplistic theme of La Strada reminds me of the famous Alfred Hitchcock classic, Rear Window, with Jimmy Stewart's amazing charm running the show.  While a bored photojournalist, laid up with a broken leg, spies on his neighbors, he suspects one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder.  What could a man of physical limitations do?

What could a man of emotional limitations do?  We see the shrewd and calculating Zampano (Anthony Quinn), eager to take advantage of anything coming his way.  He makes financial arrangements with a poor family by bargaining for one of their daughters, a young and innocent Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), eager to have her assume the role of his wife.  At first, he is delighted\\ with her participation in his circus act, reasoning that she will enhance their financial intake each time they perform.  At night, he viciously manipulates her, forcing her to do his deeds.  Soon, however, he tires of her and ventures into local bars with the extra money he earned to pursue other women.  Of course, a fight breaks out in one of his escapades and Zampano winds up at the losing end, never realizing that his chain-defying mentality is only circus born and cannot demonstrate the might he needs to muster in the real world.

They begin to perform in miniature circuses.  As Gelsomina learns the ropes, she begins to steal the act, sending Zampano into rages.  In their quest to take part in a real circus, she meets the fool, (Richard Basehart) who represents hope for her.  Although he is allusive in his communication attempts, he appears to support her contentions to be her own woman.  This arrangement only angers Zampano even more, pushing him to take strong action against the fool.  Later in the film, Gelsomina and Zampano meet the fool again, this time on the road in a remote place.  Zampano becomes so outraged at him that he fatally strikes him in the head.  Zampano is left in a state of desperation to make his death look like an accident.  Even though he appears sorry for having pushed his anger so far, his only alternative is to make Gelsomina feel responsible for the deed.

He summons the strength to realize his inadequacies, which comes, ironically at the end when he realizes what he missed when she finally leaves him.  Believing he is invincible, he moves on, but eventually, comes to terms with his shortcomings in a strange twist.  She never knew that he searched for her fruitlessly.

Federico Felini's attempt to give our exaggerated Italian macho man an invulnerable character is very successful, flavoring the mid 50's yarn with believable sketches that endure and reach out to our hearts with their limitations and human potential.  Before the movie ends, Zampano does reveal his human frailty.  When we see films like this, it's easy to understand how young Anthony Quinn rose to become one of the truly great icons of the screen.  I could see this film again and again and again...",1242000000,2,3151,4.853932584269663

A simple but effective fable, La Strada has been romanced all out of proportion but at its core it's a well-made little movie; if you don't expect anything more than an uncomplicated but well-acted film, you're likely to be pleased with what Fellini serves up.",1233792000,,278,4.791666666666667
1175219,5,B000001A5E,"I feel too small to do this but its by way of tribute. When Mr. Fellini made this film, Europe was still recovering from the war. But, most importantly, from the great challenge that Hitler and Facism had posed to human existance: that anyone who did not contribute something to society did not have a right to live. With this film Mr. Fellini masterfully answers this challenge, exposing it for the lie that it is. ""Il Matto"" put the answer into words when consoling the heart broken Gelsomina. She felt she was worthless but he explains that,of course she has worth because she is a creature of God and He has a purpose for her. What purpose? she asks the clown, to which he deftly answers that if he knew that he would be God. Yet Mr. Fellini dares to answer what the clown could not by making us love each of the characters, even the brutal Zampano. This is a victorious film. It declares in inarguable terms that our worth is not a result of wealth or what service we render to society but of the love of God. The fact that many, even ""macho"" types, are moved to tears, mourning over these loved ones, demonstrates the truth of what Mr. Fellini has conveyed in ""La Strada"".",1228867200,2,1178,4.408256880733945
1175220,4,B000001A5E,"Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini's 1954 black and white film La Strada (The Road) is one of those films that is midway between his early Neo-Realism and his later Magical Realism, with touches of both aplenty. It made both him and its female lead, his wife Giulieta Masina, stars, won the 1954 Venice Film Festival's top award and the 1956 Best Foreign Picture Academy Award, yet there is something missing from it. It is a good film, arguably a very good or near-great film, but it is definitely not a great film. It lacks the intellectual and artistic depth that the couple's next famed collaboration, Nights Of Cabiria, three years later, would have. In a sense, those critics who have called it a simple fable are correct, but even the greatest of fables cannot compare with the greatest of novels, especially those modern masterpieces, for a novel takes an in-depth 360 spin around life, and within life, whereas fables and this film often rely too strongly on archetypes, schmaltz, and sentimentality. It is not a reworking of The Beauty And The Beast tale, either, for it's not really a love story, but a loveless story, in the sense of the human denial of love. Granted, it's a mark of Fellini's consummate filmic skill that one is so easily emotionally manipulated, to the point that most viewers even care about the wretched Zampano at the film's end. But, mastering puppetry is not the same as producing good art. If it was the old Lassie American tv shows from the 1950s and 1960s would be right alongside The Odyssey and Guernica in the pantheon of great human artworks. Yet, Fellini is so great a filmmaker that even where his art is not top notch it can inspire admiration for its excellence.... The story the film tells, penned by Fellini and his long time collaborator Tullio Pinelli, is first rate, even as it comes awfully close to syrupy, while the black and white cinematography by Otelo Martelli is solid. La Strada is not a visual feast for the eyes, and some mat shots as the pair drive around in their wagon date the film, even as they are better than the techniques that filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock were using in America. But, the film is renowned most for the film score by Nino Rota, and the theme for Gelsomina that, even millions who've never heard of, much less seen, La Strada, will know from just a few bars. Yet, it does not hold up as well as other, later Fellini films, to a modern eye. It does have more in common with 1940s Hollywood films than many critics would like to admit, especially in the screenplay and scoring aspects that link it back to the social realism of 1930s American studio films- those starring a James Cagney or John Garfield.
  Still, given it's Fellini, it's much better than many other films ever made, for there are those moments one can only get in a Fellini film, just like Ingmar Bergman can only give you psychosexual angst at such a high and poetic level. With Fellini, it's those absurd moments that just stay within realistic bounds, like Gelsomina seeing a horse loudly clomping down a city street while alone and waiting for Zamapano to come back after a night with a whore, or seeing three country musicians marching by after she runs away from Zampano and is fascinated by an anthill, or her evocative theme song, first played on The Fool's mini-violin, or the oddly poetic and comic poof of a cloud that explodes from The Fool's inexplicably fiery car after Zampano pushes it off the road, into a ravine, after he kills the man. These are the touches that, even when a great artist is not in top form, separate that artist from all the many pretenders. Fellini was no pretender- he was the real thing, and La Strada is a very good film. But it was an even better augur.",1221350400,,3751,4.622188905547226
1175221,5,B000001A5E,"The face in question belongs to the enchanting Giulietta Masina.  And the movie is LA STRADA (1954), director Federico Fellini's haunting tale about the strange relationship between an innocent young waif and the boorish circus performer who takes her under his wing.

LA STRADA (""The Road"") is one of the watershed movies of Italian cinema, and also launched the international careers of director Federico Fellini and his actress wife Giulietta Masina in the process.  Amongst many accolades, the movie walked away with the 1956 Academy Award for 'Best Foreign Language Film'.

The story is one of the most haunting, heartbreaking ones you'll ever encounter; it will remain in your soul long after the credits have rolled.  A charming, somewhat backward waif named Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) is plucked from her carefree family home on the seashore and placed into the employment of Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a vagabond circus strong-man.  Complications arise when Zampano's old adversary, a highwire artist named 'The Fool' (Richard Basehart) returns to the scene.  What follows will prove fateful for the trio...

The heartrending performance of Giulietta Masina is pure perfection.  Every glance, facial expression, physical gesture shows us exactly what is happening inside the head and heart of this most magical, haunting screen character.  The audience goes along for the same emotional ride that the character of Gelsomina does.  Federico Fellini fashioned this film as a showcase for his talented wife.  Acclaimed performances in ""Nights of Cabiria"" and ""Juliet of the Spirits"" would follow in later years, and while Masina was always superbly good in anything she did, LA STRADA was and forever will be her best ever screen performance.

Zampano is a totally unsavoury character and the audience is never meant to find any kind of sympathy toward him.  The most challenging, thankless assignment for any actor is to play such a character, but Anthony Quinn delivers what he can given the limits of the material.  Richard Basehart is a lovely presence as 'The Fool', one of the lone adult characters who actually seems to care for the neglected Gelsomina.  The musical score by Nino Rota is likewise so very haunting, particularly ""Gelsomina's Theme"" which recurs throughout the second half of the film.

If you want a film which illustrates--so movingly--the sheer joy and heartbreak of simply being alive, you must see LA STRADA.  I guarantee you'll never be the same...",1214697600,3,2483,5.243037974683545

Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) is forced to live and work with Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a circus strongman. She lives with Zampano in the back of a small motorcycle trailer, and the conditions are frankly squalid, as are most of the places where they work. 'The Fool' (Richard Basehart) is the fly in the ointment, who attempts to lure Gelsomina away from Zampino with tragic results.

La Strada and Fellini was a huge influence on a number of famous films. 'Godfather II' copies the religious street festival and the ending reminded me of 'The Swimmer'.

1175224,5,B000001A5E,"I've seen one other film by Federico Fellini (it was 8 1/2) and I saw half of ""La Dolce Vita."" I know what his films are like, so when I watched ""La Strada"" I was surprised by what I saw. This film is completely unlike the aforementioned films and, therefore, is probably Fellini's most accessible film. It's a movie that has shades of a much earlier American film called ""Broken Blossoms"" but with sound and a new storyline, Fellini made a poignant, cute, and sad little film. I didn't even realize how much I liked this film until it was over. Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina plays Gelsomina, a young girl who is bought from her family by Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a strongman. As he travels around the country with her, all the while being brutally mean to her, they eventually end up at a traveling circus where Gelsomina meets The Fool (Richard Basehart), a much nicer, tender man who advises her to leave Zampano. What a perfect name for this character; The Fool. His decisions are foolish and in the end, his fate is that of a fool. The ending of the film is truly a fantastic, very well acted moment. ""La Strada"" seems to take direct inspiration from several things. The storyline is inspired by ""Broken Blossoms"" and the character of Gelsomina seems inspired by The Tramp, that is the character created by Charlie Chaplin. She's a half-wit, not very pretty, and seems to hate Zampano. Yet everytime she's given the opportunity to escape, she declines. This movie was made during the heyday of Italian neo-realism and Fellini went against convention by casting two American actors in the film (both actors dubbed a soundtrack in English, available on this DVD. I recommend you watch the Italian film though, because a dubbed Fellini film ruins the magic). Probably the most inspired casting decision in the film is Masina. I'm not very fond of when director's work with their wives, because the wife is usually in the movie solely because she's the wife (see Guy Ritchie's remake of ""Swept Away"" for proof). I can't imagine another actress portraying Gelsomina. She brings just the right amount of sadness, innocence, and playfulness to the character. Even if you're not fond of Fellini (although, if you're reading this, you probably are) I recommend that you see this film as it has a completely different mood and feel to it than his other films do. Even if you don't particularly want to see the movie, you can think of it as seeing a little piece of history (this film was the first to win the Best Foreign Language film at the Academy Awards). The Criterion Collection has done a superb, flawless transfer of the DVD.

This film is incredibly moving,disturbing and heart-breaking. The pathos may be matched by a small handful of films, but I cannot for the life of me think of one single film that tops it. It beautifully illustrates the story of a sincere,yet simple-minded burly man who knows that he seeks love,but does not have the sophistication to express it in words so finds his only recourse is to lash out,(it seems),at the woman he loves. He lashes out more at his own ineffectuality but does not know that himself. The pathos comes in because love is so new and unfamiliar that it makes him feel vulnerable,which is very frightening to his sense of masculinity. This film is operating on so many levels at once that it must be viewed at least 2 or 3 times to dredge all the gold from the many-layered conflicts going on with all 3 of the main characters. The death of the Fool is so unexpected by Zampano,(if no one else), that he finds himself trapped in the consequences of an unintended act meted out,(he felt), to level justice AS HE SAW IT. As a witness to his crime, and with her inability to move through what has occurred and go on, it causes Gelsomina to constantly remind Zampano what he has done. This, plus he must see how HIS actions have not only ended one life, but is slowly but surely destroying the bright light of joy which once existed in the one he loves until the only way he can end the pain of the truth,(as he sees it), is to abandon the best thing in his unrewarding life. When he hears the familiar song that Gelsomina used to play on her trumpet being hummed by a woman hanging the laundry and so inquires, only to find out that she died of exposure with a broken heart due to his leaving her, in the final scene it all comes home as he realises he had the brass ring and didn't even know it and as he lets out his doleful cry on the beach at night WE feel his pain right along with him as though WE TOO have lost something very dear. The way Fellini stalled the realization to the very end,(whether intended or not),so pulled the rug out from under me that I actually bawled like a baby for 10 minutes at the end of the movie and felt so helpless that the only thing I felt I could do to come out of the morass I had fallen into was to hug my wife for dear life and pray to God that I would NEVER lose sight of the treasures in my own life while foolishly chasing some rainbow or worrying about maintaining an image at the expense of everything that gives that image its substance.

Yes, La Strada is a movie with a very mundane premise (as is life) which reduces the man/woman relationship to its most base.  Men, at their most primal, are selfish brutes. Woman, left unnutured, are masochistic twits. Fellini offers a stark and staggering  perspective of humanity which forces us to relate to characters whom we see as appaulling and pathetic, yet are uncomfortably close to all of us, left with the same options.

""La Strada"" is part of a body of work that has, at its core, a thread of autobiographical sentiment so powerful and mysterious, that scholars are still dissecting his films frame by frame.

Although Fellini says, in the Criterion Collection DVD ""extra""
""I have no message for humanity...I am sorry"", we still believe that if we can decode the images, stories, fantasies and dreams of Fellini's experience/imagination, we will find profound truths. Certainly, the experience of viewing a Fellini film has proven to be worthwhile to a vast audience across geographic, linguistic and cultural boundaries, and over time. There's something to this Fellini guy's stuff...but what the heck is it? I think Fellini's films are distillations of beauty, humor, dreams, pathos, nightmares and the pleasure and pain of living. When Fellini insists that he doesn't have a message, he is probably right. He's not trying to sell ideas. He is only trying to give form to his thoughts and dreams and nightmares and fantasies and experiences and memories. The result is something we would call ""art"". For those of us susceptible to the aesthetic, Fellini is a master.

La Strada is a film with a ""neorealist"" core. The ravaged countryside, the long, lonely vistas of fields, the sea, and the faces of poverty belong in large part to the ""neorealist"" post-war films that look unflinchingly at harsh realities of a war-torn Italy.

The circus, which here forms an environment, is the backdrop for individuals who reveal their characters in a tragic landscape. Reading the film artist's biography ""Fellini on Fellini"" reveals his attitude toward the ""Auguste"" Clown"" and the imperious ""White Clown"", their relationships, power structures, and the circus as a metaphor for life itself. In ""8 1/2"", the film-maker concludes with an acceptance of life as a circus- a parade of clowns, lovers, friends and associates who enter the spotlight and give resolution to the film. Who is to argue? I think life is like a circus pretty often. There is the reality of being ""in"" the circus and behind the illusions and there is the reality of being an ""observor"" and outside. Flip this into any social situation and watch it fit.

We develop compassion and sympathy for the main characters.

Giulietta Massina is luminous as the female protagonist clown-a kind of ""Auguste"" figure (according to Fellini's own breakdown of character types). She is the butt of jokes, is the lost soul, the sidekick to the ""White Clown"", and the hapless, confused child. Anthony Quinn is oh-so-dark as Zampano, the strongman (a kind of ""White Clown"" authority figure) who blusters, bosses, bullies and frightens.

In the end of the film, a man cries at the edge of the sea.

1175231,5,B000001A5E,"""La Strada"" is Federico Fellini's bleak portrayal of life in post war Italy as formulated in the neo-realistic style of 1950's European cinema. His plot is woven through the actions of the three major characters of the flick, Zampano, Gelsomina, and il Matto.

The sensitive, innocent and dim witted Gelsomina, played emotionally by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina, is a pathetic waif in the mold of Chaplin's The Little Tramp.  She is sold into servitude by her impoverished mother to Zampano, a travelling carnival strongman played flawlwssly by Anthony Quinn.  Zampano an insensitive brute of a man needed a replacement for Gelsomina's sister Rosa who died under mysterious circumstances.  She was to serve as his assistant, cook, and companion.

Quinn taught her the rudiments of his act, a tiresome feat of strength where he broke a chain by expanding his chest.  She dressed as a clown and learn to play the trumpet.  They  travelled through rural Italy in a dilapidated motorcycle drawn tented wagon.  Gelosomina was treated poorly, often beaten by the womanizing Zaputo whose existence revolved around the basest of desires, food, drink, sleep and sex.

They eventually join up with a travelling circus where the impressionable Gelsomina meets il Matto, a part clown part aerialist played by Richard Basehart.  Il Matto who has a perceptive view of life and Zampano detest each other, resulting in a fight that lands Quinn in jail.  They are as a result both banished from the circus.  Basehart tries to convince Gelsomina to leave Zampano and instills in her. in a touching scene, a previously unfelt sense of self worth.  A feeling of obligation prevents Gelsomina from abandoning Zampano.

On their future travels they unexpectedly meet up with il Matto and in a fight Quinn accidently kills him throwing Gelsomina into a frenzy.  This episode and the austere nature of her life causes Gelsomina to descend into madness.  She gets abandoned by Quinn who finds out years later that she had died.  In a rare display of emotion, Quinn, now an aged drunken sot, is driven to tears as the weight of responsibilty of her demise apparently weighs heavily on him.

Fellini creates a stirring and disturbing portrait of three distinctly different types of people, using depressing and squalid settings as a backdrop. Their interractions ultimately result in their destruction, if not physically then emotionally i a sad commentary on the human condition.",1125446400,3,2456,5.110275689223058
1175232,5,B000001A5E,"""La Strada"" is one of the finest tragedies every produced.  I still cannot believe that the movie is over 50 years old.  Fellini's brevity and use of only three major characters allows viewers to quickly become absorbed in the story.  Zampano is anti-social in the psychological sense of the term as he cares little for anyone or anybody until the very end, when we see that even he is not immune to the calls of conscience and passion.

I am often amazed at the way foreign cinema emerged after the second world war and how films like this one (and others like ""Diamonds and Ashes"") appear less dated than their American counterparts.  ""La Strada"" is a work that will last forever.  Only stories drenched in human emotion are the ones that become timeless.

In my Fellini rankings, I'd place this behind ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""8 1/2"", but I would still give it five stars--even more if I could.",1111276800,9,893,4.578616352201258
1175233,4,B000001A5E,"This film is considered by many to be Fellini's best. Anthony Quinn is just astounding as the rough gruff strong man Zampano. He is equally matched by Fellini's wife Giulletta Massina, who plays the simpleton Gelsomina a woman who is bought by Zampano to use in his street show, and despite the fact that she is treated abysmally, she falls in love with Zampano. An equally amazing performance is given by Richard Basehart as Il Matto (literally, The Fool) who goads Zampano into an outrageous act of cruelty. This film is funny, beautiful, and moving, and well worth seeing, even with subtitles. There are several great circus and clown scenes in it, but it's the performances, especially by Quinn and Massina that make this film a classic.",1109808000,5,741,4.84251968503937
1175234,5,B000001A5E,"Federico Fellini, a cinematic artist, experimented with what was within the frame of the scene and how it would come across to the audience.  Throughout his life, Fellini, made several films and every single film had at least one moment of genius where what was within the frame touched the very soul of the viewer.  Initially influenced by the Italian neorealism, however, throughout his career Fellini moved to a visual expressive depiction of the world that frequently seemed dreamlike or artistically expressive.

La Strada was strongly influenced by neorealism, but there is also evidence of hints of what's to come from Fellini's later cinematic creations.  Fellini argued that neorealism should not merely emphasize on the characters social status, but also the spiritual and philosophical portion.  For example, Fellini has several themes intermingled in La Strade such as the circus, a character in midair (performing a tightrope act), a lusty man, and the sea among other themes.  These themes have strong spiritual and philosophical connotation in the manner in which Fellini visually expresses the themes.  Thus, it seems as if Fellini began his cinematic experimentation in La Strada, as he continued to develop his calling.

The opening scene depicts Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) standing on an empty and untouched beach along the Mediterranean.  Gelsomina is the films heroine, a feeble and dimwitted character, yet she has the heart in the right place as she innocently explores what confronts her.  The scene by the sea intriguingly grabs the audience's attention as it does Gelsomina as if she expects an answer from the seemingly endless sea.  This is a classic example of Fellini's cinematic expressiveness as he subtly plants a seed within the audience's mind, which will later bloom as the tale continues.

Zampano (Anthony Quinn), a bullying strongman who travels from town to town to display his only talent, breaking chains with his chest, buys Gelsomina for a meager 10000 Lire.  Together they venture, in his motorcycle trailer that functions as home, office, and storage all in one, to a new town.  At first, Gelsomina is awestruck by her part in the small traveling spectacle, where she is trained like a puppy to beat a drum in order to assemble an audience.  She feels a clear affection from Zampano, while he at this moment is completely unaware of himself.

Gradually Gelsomina begins to steal his act with her charismatic innocent clownish look, which is Chaplinesque as some have put it.  Gelsomina's success stirs Zampano's anger, which seems to be the only feeling he is capable of expressing.  This triggers Zampano to further his exploitation of Gelsomina as he  physically and sexually abuses her.  However, it is not the abuse that troubles her the most.  In pain Gelsomina watches Zampano disregard the natural beauty of what passes them on their journey.  It is Zampano's blindness to the small wonders of the world that stirs up warm affections within her.

Gelsomina encounters a character that is referred to as the Fool (Richard Basehart) as she temporarily escapes the brutish Zampano.  When Gelsomina sees the Fool for the first time he is performing on a rope between two buildings where he is dressed as a bumblebee that sits down in midair while eating pasta.  Unlike Zampano, the Fool appears to be rather wise as he suggests that Gelsomina should leave him, yet Gelsomina insists on staying with Zampano.  This cinematic moment emphasizes Gelsomina's kind and forgiving nature, which could be similar to the one of a saint.  In addition, it brings the focus to Gelsomina and the unconditional love she has for Zampano.

Zampano continues to be brutish, but it is his brutishness that Gelsomina recognizes as his weakness.  It seems as if Zampano is rough and tough in order to deal with his inner feelings, but it also clouds his own judgment as he fails to see his love for Gelsomina.  This is truly tragic, as they both want one another, yet one is continuing to reject the other.

La Strada offers a brilliant cinematic experience that offers much to contemplate in a spiritual, existential, philosophical, and socioeconomic manner as the images spellbind the audience.  The cinematography and the music in the film can distinctively be recognized as a part of Fellini's story telling, which enhances and stirs up the emotional portion of the film.  Fellini's wife, Giulietta Masina, performed magnificently as her character slowly grew throughout the tale and Anthony Quinn brought the extra that was needed in order to convey a genuine brute.  Ultimately, Fellini will offer the audience a cinematic gift that will leave no one untouched as two opposites attract.",1102636800,60,4722,5.097529258777633

1175237,4,B000001A5E,"The story to La Strada is very simple. Despite some flaws it is a very powerful film that unlike some other Fellini films can be understood and adored by many. Is it as good as his others? I'm not sure. I do like it better than the ones I have seen (8 1/2, I Vitelloni, Roma, and Satyricon.) I'll leave that question un-answered till I get a chance to see Il Bidone, La Dolce Vita and a few others.
One thing for sure is this has some of the greatest music I've ever heard in a film. Nino Rota really outdid himself with the soundtrack to this film. It's full of passion and perfectly suits the film. If it wasn't for Rota's music Fellini's films would have never had impact that they did. In the same sense that Sergio Leone's films would be garbage without the music of Ennio Morricone. Actually wait, a better example would be Francis Ford Copalla without Nino Rota. I don't think the Godfather would have had as big of an impact without Rota's music. The Score to The Godfather is pretty much the best thing about the films. I don't think he did the soundtrack to part three. Not sure if he was alive then. Another reason why that film blows.
Some brilliant scenes in this film. Especially the one where Giulietta Massina (Gelsomina) is sitting quietly by a dirt road as 3 members of a marching band walk by playing their instruments urging her to follow them. This film is filled with beautiful moments like that.
If you're a first time Fellini viewer I would definetly reccomend La Strada.",1093564800,2,1495,4.44

which I've owned since its release.
The English soundtrack on this LD is flawless...not
a single ""dropoff"" from start to finish.

up somehow and the result is several minutes of
missing audio.

Giulietta Masina is unattractive and a most unenjoyable screen presence.  There, I said it again.  Call me shallow, but I want my movie stars to be visually pleasing.  Fellini reminds me of Citizen Kane demanding that his wife be a star.  The original voice track production ruined the film: I wanted to hear the Italian voices but then couldn't hear Quinn's real voice (the whole film was dubbed, twice, it has no ""original"" sound).  Also, Fellini's films are too long.  If you are not telling the story of Gandhi or Lawrence of Arabia, then keep your drama to under 90 minutes.  For a film with virtually no plot, La Strada takes a very long journey down such a short (and frankly, insignificant) road.
Regarding the Criterion DVD, the image is crisp.  That's it.  The special documentary is boring and could have fit on the first disc, I don't know why they used two.  As usual, Criterion offers no subtitles beyond English.  Marty Scorsese offers up a 120 second summary in which he doesn't really say anything complementary about the film.  How much did he get paid for that interview, $10k, maybe $20?  Don't worry, you're paying for it, as this disc is highly overpriced in the Criterion tradition.

1175240,5,B000001A5E,"This is one of those films which can, albeit its slow-pacing, deliver an unforgettable and complex experience.
The plot is no brainer; Gelsomina (played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina) is sold by her poor mother to a brute fairground wrestler, Zampan&ograve; (Quinn) in order to be his show assistant. Just a few moments later, one can see Zampan&ograve; nature; he tortures Gelsomina, both verbally and physically. But the latter receives these harsh treatment very meekly - at times, she seems to represent  a martyr figure, in some respect resembling Christ. On their way they meet the Fool (Basehart), who doesn't get along with Zampan&ograve;, which leads to great tragedy. In the end, seeing what his actions have spawned, Zampan&ograve; finally attains his humanity - but it is probably too late for second chances ...
Some argue that this is Fellini's ''easiest'' film and a kind of homage to Charlie Chaplin with the persona of Gelsomina. I still say that this is a film not to be missed - it contains so many truths of life that it is essential to be seen by every human being.",1083369600,7,1091,4.865591397849462

1175242,2,B000001A5E,"Fellini is over rated (!). There, I mentioned it. His 'indominable imagination', while influential as far as filmmakers such as Terry Gilliam are concerned (see Criterion's 81/2), is simply not enough to sustain narrative or deep thematic concerns. He does not hang enough ideas on these elaborate constructions, seems more or less disinterested in developing the figures he creates beyond extrapolating on their grotesque/freakish/cute/unusual qualities. He really does not like women very much (but then I suppose not many male filmmakers do). The conceptualisation of his female characters always falls within the(yawn) well defined limits of the old madonna... thing. Women are capricious, sexual, wanton, barely glimpsed, desired (etc.) or hag-like, stupid, ugly (etc.)in Fellini's films. In this film the Chaplinesque main character, a woman, is made out to be rather a dullard, her cloying cuteness and mugging at the camera notwithstanding.
But that's going off at a tangent; the films are pretty to watch and this one has a particularly interesting context (Fellini wanting to break through the confines of the familiar neo-realist tradition of that period in Italian cinema etc.), but the razzle dazzle and surface beauty of the film while captivating at first soon becomes, quite frankly, boring.",1077494400,8,1307,5.507462686567164

After viewing the masterpiece ""8 1/2"", I was anxious to check out another film by this director I have always heard so much about, and my search lead me to ""La Strada"".  I just finished watching it about 15 minutes ago, and once again, I am deeply affected, and aware of being in the presence of brilliance.
The plot details can be read in the editorial review above, so I'll just make some comments.  First of all, the story is unforgetable.  If you are a lover of high art and are open-minded to the classics of cinema, there is no way you will walk away from this film unaffected.  The powerful performance by Quinn, the heartbreaking, delicate perfomance by Masina, and the comical, yet touching performance by Basehart combine to produce one of the greatest ensemble performances I have ever seen on screen.  Together with Fellini's magical touch, a masterpiece of cinema is born.  The story is funny, yet sad....simple, yet thought-provoking.  In all, it rightly deserves to be called a classic, and I recommend it to anyone who has a true appreciation of film.
Criterion Collection has done it again with another beautiful package.  The transfer is near flawless.  The picture is practicaly blemish free, and the unforgettable Nino Rota score is clear and vibrant.  Since I just got this DVD, I haven't gotten a chance to view all the extras, but this is a double-disc set from Criterion, which usually means that its packed to the brim with wonderful supplemantal material.  I know that the higher prices Criterion charges for their DVDs turns alot of folks off, but for me, I've found that the labor of love that they put into each DVD makes the slightly higher prices well worth it.

I ask you, though - how about Richard Basehart !?! ?! I mean, this guy turns in the performance of his life! Who knew?

How could anyone have predicted that performance? This is a guy that appeared on ""Love Boat"" and ""Knight Rider"" and many, many other television shows of dubious worth before those aired in the 1980's. He was the star of "" Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"" in the 60's (1964 to 1968, I think).

But, if only for a shining moment, in La Strada he knocked out a performance that was worthy of an Oscar. And he deserved a best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of Matta. But. . . Hollywood being what it was then, and art films being poison at the box office in 1954, he didn't even get a nomination.

Talk about a bad break - that was his moment, and he was never that good again. At least not at a moment when anyone was watching.

Next time you see a journeyman actor plying his or her craft on some inane television show, give a fleeting thought to Richard Basehart and those like him.",1072310400,,1260,4.322033898305085

Several minor cuts were made for the American release, and the disparities between the complete Italian cut of LA STRADA and its shorter American counterpart have resulted in a number of unavoidable audio dropouts on the English-dubbed track on the DVD. This is not a flaw in the DVD of La Strada but an accurate reflection of the Italian and American versions and an indication of the cuts that were made for the American release.] Many thanks to Mr. Mulvaney for looking further into the problem and getting right back to me.

This film was Fellini's first successs, and won best foreign film Acadamy Award. Picture Quality on this DVD is breathtaking; virtually no grain, dust, or scratches. Audio is clear in both original Italian or English, and it also features informative commentary. Other great features include the English trailer and a documentary on the life Of director Fellini. Another fine entry in the Criterion Collection that will remain in my permanent personal collection.
  La Strada is the heartbreaking story of Gelsomina (played with great subtlety and tenderness by Giulietta Masina) who is sold to the mean and unloving performer Zampano (a fine preformance by Anthony Quinn). Then the story follows the two performing artists through their many adventures and misadventures, and that is what becomes the brillance of La Strada. A classic neorealest tale of compassion and of how everything and everyone has its purpose in life. A great film from one of the greatest, eccentric, and most versitle directors of all time, Federico Fellini, before his work became extremely outrageous and surreal (like Roma and Satyricon). La Strada is not one of those indulgent films, which, in their own way are brilliant, but don't think that La Strada is one of those, and don't let Fellini's later work deter you from seeing his better earlier masterpieces.
  Finally I would like to highly reccomend Fellini's Nights Of Cabiria, also staring Masina and available on a great Criterion DVD. Cabiria is one of my top 20 favorites and should be seen with La Strada not for their similarities, but for the fact that they complement each other extremely well. Masina will make you laugh at her silly dancing and emotional outbursts and make you cry (as I always do) at her misfortune. She is a survivor who believes in love and life even after her greatest let downs. A character unlike the unconfidant but lovable Gelsomina in La Strada.

But it's clearly one of TOP5 I'd feel like my life has a gigantic hole if I didn't watch it in my life. I'm glad watched this over and over again and I am glad we can own it now. How happy we are!

1175252,5,B000001A5E,"This is a good film to begin with for those of us who have experienced only great filmmakers and exceptional actresses.  In ""La Strada,"" director Federico Fellini blends himself with the person of his wife, Giulietta Masina, to produce the first of his so-called lonliness trilogy.  The result is understated and magnificent, carrying all the themes (in innocent, embryonic form) he would develop in future films like ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""8 1/2."" Fellini often used non-actors in his movies because he wanted to explore the true characters of true people.  From that perspective, the best direction he gave in this film was simply to turn the camera on Masina.
You have probably read much more about the director than his oft-overlooked wife, so the suggestion here is to enjoy the film (happilly now available on DVD), but don't miss the opporunity to explore yourself through your responses to Masina as Gelsomina. Note her character when she is not speaking.  Her facial and bodilly expressions say more than the very sparse script. (This is an easy subtitle-read for that reason.) She is contrasted with Anthony Quinn's equally non-verbal--but incomunicado--Zampano.  Here is an actress who becomes herself through her roles more than any actor or actress I have watched.  Is Gelsomina merely charicature or is she cosmic archetype?  I think she is the latter--and less distinguishable from Masina than any character I know of--except Cabiria, lead role in the 3rd of this trilogy, ""Nights Of Cabiria.""  There, Masina is at her heart-opening best, her heart-warming and heart-breaking best.  ""La Strada"" is, no less, a true classic of literary drama.
Fellini is probably one of the 4 or 5 five most provocative filmakers in cinema's history and certainly the best at what he did.  The same is NOT true of Giulietta Masina.  She is NOT one of the best actresses in the history of cinema and cannot be compared to any other actor or actress.  She is, by contrast, the ONLY actress who did what she could do and is a class by herself--an actress with enough room in her spirit to cover the spectrum of Gelsomina and Cabiria, lovely, sage, and innocent.

1175254,5,B000001A5E,"Yes this movie is accessible, and simple, and beautiful, but to say that this is his one Masterpiece, or to belittle his other films as ""out there,"" is an easy solution for people who are missing the truly amazing thing about this film maker.  Fellini is profoundly beautiful because of his painful, inspired, growth that is so obviously documented in his films, from the White Sheik to his climax at 8 1/2 and beyond. The creative blood and sweat that he puts into his films, and his willingness to go way out on a limb, giving his films a work-in-progress feel, are what make them so human and what make him superior as a film maker to Orson Wells, who's brilliance allowed him to make a cold, flawless film at a very young age, but who career depresses rather than inspires. La Strada was the product of Fellini's raw talent, his craft. 8 1/2 was the product of a man who had lived.",1003968000,12,885,4.429447852760736
1175255,1,B000001A5E,"Beware this version of the famed Fellini classic, La Strada. The label says it was distributed by Public Media Home Vision. Cover says New Subtitles -- by that they mean the Italian has been over-dubbed in English making it almost unintelligible. You've been warned! If I find a version elsewhere with actual sub-titles I'll try to post it here. We'll see if it gets published!",998956800,17,377,4.815384615384615
1175256,5,B000001A5E,"This masterpiece would be the greatest movie ever produced it it had been made in the United States.  The movie was produced in Italy however and is in black and white--an art movie.  The music score is beautiful but poorly engineered.  The transitions in this movie are incredible.  One is taken into scenes of raw poverty and expertly led into its professional acting.  These transitions are so well done that one finds it very difficult to seperate the two.  The acting is performed by Anthony Quinn, who plays a circus strongman, Giulietta who plays his 'wife' and assistant and Richard Basehart who plays a daredevil fool.  There is too much to this movie to describe.  One could teach a class with this single classic.  To do a little compare and contrast, the movie starts with a young worthless lady on a beach and ends with a worthless man on a beach.  Between this beginning and end, Gelsomina, played by Guilietta, grows up while chatting with the circus clown and 'fool' about her relationship with her tyrannical strongman mate.  The scenes in this movie demonstrate how Gelsomina is trapped as a poor, young Italian woman.  This movie captures a place and time and burns it forever into film.  Great movie.",995673600,10,1220,4.779904306220096
1175257,5,B000001A5E,"A man of uncommon strength, who lives on the road and makes his living as an entertainer performing feats of strength, but who masks the emptiness of his life with a perpetual show of bravura, is the focal point of ""La Strada,"" directed by Federico Fellini and written by Fellini and Tullio Pinelli.  It's the story of Zampano (Anthony Quinn), who travels from town to town, eking out a meager living by passing the hat after each performance, which consists mainly of wrapping a quarter-inch chain made of iron around his chest, then breaking it by expanding his lungs.  In his endeavors he is assisted by Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), a simple-minded young woman who is devoted to this selfish man endowed with little more intelligence than she.  The tragedy of Zampano is that while he seeks fulfillment in meaningless carnal pursuits and the hollow acclaim of strangers, the happiness that eludes him is at hand; but his own self-deception prevents him from recognizing what a treasure he already has in Gelsomina.  One of Fellini's earliest films, there is a straightforward, almost simplistic richness to his style, both visually and narratively, that is devoid of the surreal atmosphere with which he invests his later projects.  Still, the mood he creates is mesmerizing, aided to a great extent by the haunting theme and score by Nino Rota.  It is a story that gradually draws the viewer in through the sympathy evoked by the gentle innocence of Gelsomina, whose purity of spirit is seemingly in such stark contrast to that of Zampano.  Watching her respond to his unthinking brutality of her with unadulterated kindness, time after time, is heartrending; and in the end, when Zampano ultimately secures our sympathies as well, it seems almost contradictory, though contextually just.  As Zampano, Anthony Quinn gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career; with depth and nuance, he creates the epitome of the brutal simpleton, a man whose lack of wit forces him to exist by the most basic of instincts.  And Quinn conveys it all so perfectly, both physically and emotionally; it is an inspired, memorable performance.  But without question, the true heart of the film is provided by the wondrous Giulietta Masina.  What a superb, unforgettable performance; everything about her is totally engaging, beginning with the supple roundness of her face, which accentuates her expressive eyes and winning smile.  Her Gelsomina is so lithe, her presence so angelic, that at times it seems as if she is about to float up off the screen.  She conveys such compassion and vulnerability, such warmth of being, that it becomes impossible not to lose your heart to her.  It is quite simply an irresistible, truly heartwarming performance.  Also, in an exceptionally effective supporting role, is Richard Basehart, as Il ""Matto,"" the ""Fool.""  A tightrope walker by trade, the Fool is the antithesis of Zampano, a lighthearted soul who befriends Gelsomina and becomes her voice of hope and logic, while at the same time manifesting a taunting, challenging and unwelcomed presence to Zampano.  Ironically, it is the Fool who becomes the catalyst for the tragedies that ultimately befall Gelsomina, and finally Zampano.  The supporting cast includes Aldo Silvani (Il Signor Giraffa), Marcella Rovere (The Widow) and Livia Venturini (The Sister).  An earthy, thought-provoking film, ""La Strada"" is one that will linger on sweetly in your mind's eye; the images and impressions it creates may, with time, dissolve-- but the essence of it will remain with you always.  For once Fellini has touched you, it is forever.",981590400,26,3628,5.096283783783784

This film is an original from beginning to end, revealing greater depths of meaning and motivation on each successive viewing.  This is film as serious art, which is an all-too-rare commodity.  To compare it to other classics, I find it more important and emotionally rewarding than Vertigo, Floating Weeds, or 8 1/2.  I have seen several Fellini films, and I have ordered more, but I rate this his best.  To greatly oversimplify in the service of brevity. the plot is about an innocent, simple-minded girl who experiences so much anguish in her life that it drives her to madness.  I'll leave the rest as mysterious and ambiguous as the filmmaker does, to the delight of the serious viewer of films.  The last time I watched it, I turned on the commentary, which is quite revealing.  The cinematography and music are outstanding.",1500508800,,944,4.713414634146342
