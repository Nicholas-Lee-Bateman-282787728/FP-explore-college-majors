3615149,4,B001GLLOFW,"This is a very different type of western, it's a bit like going on adventure and never really knowing what to expect. The two main characters (Matt Damon and Henry Thomas) do an excellent job and give a very sincere performance. The panorama of the film through Texas and Mexico is superb and the horse scenes are really well done. It's not an easy film to follow, and it takes a bit of concetration (especially when you get involved with the Mexican revolution), but it really portrays the mental anguish that the main characters go through. Penelope Cruz acts her part well and is always lovely to look at. I read somewhere that this film had a real lot chopped out of it and it does at times seem to be a bit dis-jointed, but all in all it's a good story, it keeps your interest and it's definitely worth a couple of hours of your time.",1354492800,,839,4.350318471337579

Not blockbuster material but good for a room of all age groups!
And of course, you must have a love for horses!",1395619200,,342,4.044117647058823
