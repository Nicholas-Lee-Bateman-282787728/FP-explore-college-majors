3043180,5,B000ZOXDKA,"Don't you just hate it when the description of one of these classic cartoon sets doesn't include a description of the cartoons? In this case, they are really worth mentioning, as some, such as Disc Two's ""Peace on Earth,"" aren't exactly kiddie fare, and many others are true animation classics (I've starred the ones I think best earn that honor). With that in mind, here's a description of each cartoon, written as I watch them:

DISC ONE

Each of these was honored by the Academy as the Best Cartoon of the Year:

1. THE MILKY WAY* (MGM, 1940)
Clear color, great clarity and a nice period song highlight this restored cute classic. When three little kittens lose their mittens, they're sent straight to bed -- where they dream that they sail a hot air balloon up into the Milky Way, a land overflowing with milk geysers and springs. The cartoon was the first Oscar winner that wasn't produced by Disney.

2. YANKEE DOODLE MOUSE* (MGM, 1943)
Typical Tom and Jerry antics doused in patriotic instrumentals such as ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""Over There."" Dynamite, egg grenades and champagne-bottle corks are the weapons of choice. I'll admit I'm not the biggest Tom & Jerry fan, but my 13-year-old daughter loves this one.

3. MOUSE TROUBLE (MGM, 1944)
Tom's the one in trouble as he attempts to rid the house of Jerry, using the ideas in a book called ""How to Catch a Mouse (A Random Mouse Book).""

4. QUIET PLEASE* (MGM, 1945)
Even I like this one. In fact, I LOVE this one! Though it's directed by Hanna and Barbera, Tex Avery's jaw-dropping influence is all through it. Funny gags, great character expressions! When a sleepy Spike threatens to kill Tom if the cat doesn't keep quiet (""If I hear one more sound I've gonna skin you alive, get it?""), Jerry tries to make as much noise as he can. Optional audio commentary by animator Mark Kausler highlights the contributions from many former Disney artists.

5. THE CAT CONCERTO* (MGM, 1947)
When Jerry disrupts Tom's grand piano performance of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody, Tom fights back while never missing a note. Optional audio commentary by animator Eric Goldberg. You know, I'm really starting to get into this Tom & Jerry stuff!

6. TWEETIE PIE* (Warner Bros., 1947)
A cat (here named Thomas, later known as Sylvester) uses a variety of screwball techniques as he tries to catch the little yellow bird in a series of short sketches. Vivid color! The first Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, and the first Warner Bros. short to win an Oscar.

7. THE LITTLE ORPHAN (MGM, 1949)
Tiny mouse Nibbles is always hungry, which causes trouble for Jerry.

8. FOR SCENT-IMENTAL REASONS* (Warner Bros., 1949)
The debut of Pep Le Pew (my favorite Chuck Jones character), an amorous skunk who mistakes a black female cat for a potential mate. Pep's influence can be seen in the Disney characters Lumiere from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B00003CX8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast</a>&nbsp;as well as Capt. Jack Sparrow from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean/dp/B00005JM5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>&nbsp;films. Optional audio commentary by animator Greg Ford.

9. SO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE (Warner Bros., 1949)
This 10-minute animated PSA won the 1949 Oscar for Best Documentary Short. Its point: how federal public-health services can keep babies healthy and free from diseases. Cute, and better than it sounds, though scenes include such things as ""untreated sewage running into our pretty creek."" Optional audio commentary by animation historian Jerry Beck.

10. THE TWO MOUSEKETEERS (MGM, 1951)
Musketeers Jerry and Nibbles cause trouble for Royal Guard Tom at a king's banquet. Routine.

11. JOHANN MOUSE (MGM, 1952)
Tom learns to play the piano in an effort to catch Jerry, who can't help but dance whenever he hears a Johann Strauss waltz. MGM debuted a new-look Tom with this short, in which he first appears without the grey stripe between his eyes.

12. SPEEDY GONZALES* (Warner Bros., 1955)
They couldn't make this one today! To help his starving friends, the Mexican Don Juan mouse must sneak past makeshift border guard Sylvester and raid a U.S. cheese factory. When one of the friends proclaims ""Speedy Gonzales a friend of my sister!"" another replies ""Speedy Gonzales friend of everybody's sister. Optional music-only audio track.

13. BIRDS ANONYMOUS (Warner Bros., 1957)
Sylvester tries to break his addiction to feathered food by joining Birds Anonymous, but the temptation of Tweety is too much. Includes the first appearance of Sylvester's fellow feline, Sam.

14. KNIGHTY-KNIGHT BUGS (Warner Bros., 1958)
On a quest for a Singing Sword, Bugs Bunny sneaks into the castle of the Black Knight, where he meets a fire-breathing, but sneezing dragon. Song: ""Cuddle Up a Little Closer.""

15. THE DOT AND THE LINE* (MGM, 1965)
A line loves a dot, but she's hot for a squiggle in this charming, colorful and witty 10-minute Chuck Jones gem. Subtitled ""A Romance in Lower Mathematics,"" it's based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-1963-book/dp/1587170663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the 1963 book</a>&nbsp;by architect and children's author Norton Juster. Optional audio commentary by Eric Goldberg. Optional music-only audio track.

DISC TWO

1. POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS SINBAD THE SAILOR* (Paramount /Fleischer, 1936)
When Sinbad (i.e., Bluto) challenges Popeye to a series of battles, the big brute nearly wins until Popeye pulls out his can of spinach. Many scenes use modeled sets to create three-dimensional backgrounds. 16 minutes, color. Optional audio commentary by Jerry Beck, illustrator Leslie Cabarga and animators Ray Pointer and Bob Jaques.

2. PEACE ON EARTH* (MGM, 1939)
A chilling classic. During a post-apocalyptic Christmas Eve, two young squirrels ask their grandfather what the word ""men"" means in the lyric ""Peace on earth, good will to men."" As he explains that man was the species that destroyed itself by waging war, the cartoon shows rotoscoped scenes of armed conflict. Optional audio commentary by Greg Ford.

3. A WILD HARE* (Warner Bros., 1940)
The first official Bugs Bunny cartoon looks primitive by later standards, but still has all the ingredients of the rascally rabbit's recipe. When ""wabbit"" hunter Elmer Fudd sticks his rifle down a hole, up pops Bugs to ask ""What's up, Doc?"" Optional audio commentary by Greg Ford.

4. PUSS GETS THE BOOT* (MGM, 1940)
Tom is called Jaspar in this early version of a Tom and Jerry short. A typical cat-and-mouse chase results in a number of broken household objects. Optional audio commentary by Mark Kausler.

5. SUPERMAN* (Paramount /Fleischer, 1941)
The classic story of The Man Of Steel as told in a 10-minute animated short, including his early life in rural Kansas. Later, he works with Perry White and Lois Lane at The Daily Planet as Clark Kent, but must change into Superman to save Lois, and the world, from a mad scientist. The first Superman cartoon. Optional audio commentary by producer Paul Dini.

6. HIAWATHA'S RABBIT HUNT (Warner Bros., 1941)
When an Elmer Fudd-like Hiawatha (from the classic Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Song-of-Hiawatha/dp/0486447952/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Song of Hiawatha</a>) arrives in the forest hunting rabbits for dinner, Bugs will have none of it.

7. RHAPSODY IN RIVETS* (Warner Bros., 1941)
Ever seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia-2000-s/dp/B00003CWPX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia 2000's</a>&nbsp;version of ""Rhapsody in Blue""? Here's an obvious inspiration. A construction site foreman imagines himself as as conductor of Franz Liszt's ""Hungarian Rhapsody,"" with his workers as the orchestra.

8. THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS (MGM, 1941)
Tom chases Jerry under and around a Christmas tree until -- holy cats! -- he is touched by the holiday spirit.

9. THE BLITZ WOLF* (MGM, 1942)
When the evil Adolph Wolf wants to invade the state of Pigmania, Sergeant Pork spoils his plans. A wartime take on ""The Three Little Pigs."" Optional audio commentary by Eric Goldberg.

10. PIGS IN A POLKA* (Warner Bros., 1942)
In a parody of Disney's 1940 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia</a>, The Big Bad Wolf channels the spirit of Deems Taylor as he introduces a spoof of the Three Little Pigs set to a classical music piece, in this case Brahms' ""Hungarian Dances.""

11. SWOONER CROONER* (Warner Bros., 1944)
Frank Sinatra, Cab Calloway, Jimmy Durante and Al Jolson are among the crooners caricatured as Porky Pig holds a contest to help his hens lay more eggs. Songs include ""As Time Goes By,"" ""Shortenin' Bread,"" ""Lullaby of Broadway"" and ""You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby.""

12. WALKY TALKY HAWKY* (Warner Bros., 1946)
When naive young chicken hawk Henery comes across Foghorn Leghorn, the rooster proclaims ""I'm a horse!"" and proceeds to convince the little bird that the real chicken is the Barnyard Dog. ""Ooh!"" says Henery. ""That's the biggest chicken I ever did see!"" Optional audio commentary by Jerry Beck.

13. DR. JEKYLL AND MR. MOUSE (MGM, 1947)
Every idea backfires when Tom tries to stop Jerry from drinking from a milk bowl.

14. MOUSE WRECKERS (Warner Bros., 1948)
Claude Cat debuts as he battles with hobo mice Hubie and Bertie over a new home.

5. FROM A TO Z-Z-Z-Z* (Warner Bros., 1953)
The daydreams of schoolboy Ralph Phillips include flying like a bird, punching out an opponent in the boxing ring and becoming Douglas MacArthur. Optional audio commentary by animation author Amid Amidi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Modern-Style-and-Design-in-1950s-Animation/dp/0811847314/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Modern: Style and Design in 1950s Animation</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Robots/dp/B000A1ETUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Robots</a>).

Homewrecker! That's the reputation a singing giraffe from Africa gets after she arrives at a zoo and develops a relationship with a married male.

12. NOW HEAR THIS* (Warner Bros., 1962)
This spare, surreal, almost psychedelic Chuck Jones masterpiece concerns an old British gent who thinks he finds a magical hearing aid, though it's actually a horn from Satan's forehead. There's no dialogue, but many, many sound effects. The first Warner Bros. short to feature the company's revised graphic titles, it also includes a rarely heard rendition of ""The Merry Go-Round Broke Down."" Optional audio commentary by Amid Amidi.

There are two nice bonus features. ""Drawn for Glory: Animation's Triumph at the Oscars"" is a new 60-minute, clip-heavy documentary that covers all the major studios. ""What's Cookin' Doc?"" is a 1944 Bugs Bunny short that shows the rabbit at an Academy Awards ceremony fighting to win the Oscar for ""Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt.""

Most notably excluded are Rhapsody Rabbit and Canary Row, so you can compare the former and The Cat Concerto for yourselves, and the latter was withdrawn to let For Scent-imental Reasons take its place, finally giving Chuck Jones his due when it won! You never know what kind of classic you'll see next with this set, and this is no Public Domain collection; it's an authorized collection by the WB, with a ton of bonus features, including an hour-long documentary about the history of the Oscars, especially with animation, and the 1944 un-nominated short What's Cookin', Doc?, featuring Bugs Bunny at the Oscars! This collection's a must-own for fans of classic toons, even for the toons that had involvement with the Oscars! Other reviewers here will let you in on what's in this prestigious, prodigious, collection, so's not to copy them! It's a wonder Disney never made a home video collection of Oscar-worthy toons quite like this, from Mickey's Orphans from 1931 to Feast from 2014! This set by the WB will also blow you away, since it's all too real!",1454976000,,1749,4.663430420711974

The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill. If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.

3043226,5,B000ZOXDKA,"This is perhaps the ultimate animation collection for classic cartoons from rival studios, though also controversial. I don't really appreciate that Bugs Bunny only won one Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject (out of just three nominations, no less) while Tom and Jerry won seven (not that I don't like Tom and Jerry, I just think that Bugs is the best cartoon character of all time). I'm very surprised that Bugs' was never even nominated for his hit shorts like ""Baseball Bugs,"" ""Bugs Bunny Rides Again,"" and ""What's Opera, Doc?"" I guess Bugs was like the John Wayne of cartoons; immensely popular among the public, but only winning one Oscar late in his career. I'm also surprised that Popeye only got a single Oscar nomination for all his success, and that ""Popeye the Sailor meets Sinbad the Sailor"" didn't even win the award. Still, this is one awesome DVD set. Just about all these classic theatrical cartoons from Warner Bros., MGM and Paramount were what I grew up watching on Cartoon Network in the '90s (back when Cartoon Network was awesome). I definitely recommend this. The inclusion of the Bugs Bunny short ""What's Cooking, Doc?"" and the documentary ""Drawn for Glory"" as bonus material is also very nice.",1406851200,,1228,4.880382775119617

But WB cartoon fans beware that of the 15 items in this package from the 1940s & 50s, 9 are MGM ( 7 Tom and Jerry, 1 Three Little Kittens, and 1 Chuck Jones modern abstraction ""The Dot & the Line"").The remaining 6 are WB, but 1 is a Public Health Service animation rewarded only as serious health publicity. So this package contains only 5 WB cartoons (all available on VHS & DVD sets before) and does not include characters (.e.g. Foghorn Leghorn) who appear in the cover art. A great case of false advertisement by imagery. I know Warner Brothers currently owns the MGM archive and via Turner Entertainment has given us great DVD movie transfers at great prices, but the deception used on the cartoons here is not necessary. For WB Toon fans, worth owning for the cover art only if bought at a low price (on sale as low as $3.99 new).",1388275200,2,1058,4.544502617801047

3043250,5,B000ZOXDKA,"I've been buying a number of DVDs of restored cartoons from the days of about late WWII through 1960. The reason I wanted them is that I really enjoyed these cartoons as a kid on my visits to the movie houses. The movies functioned as our TV. Plus, these were really great cartoons, much better than modern animated cartoons, in my opinion. I get a kick out of them, of course, but I'm really buying them for my little boy (4 1/2) and I get great enjoyment out of seeing him gleefully laughing, just as I did as a kid. My latest acquisition is the ""Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection - 15 Winners"" DVD. I'm spelling this out completely, because many of the reviews as listed here don't fit this particular disc that is for sale. The disc is listed plainly and simply but the reviews are from two and three disc compilations. This is one disc with 15 features plus a few extras.

I find the cover of the disc to be somewhat misleading. A casual observer, such  as me, would look at the disc and assume that the contents were mostly of the Looney Tunes cartoons, because that's what is illustrated. Tom and Jerry are only two of the nine characters shown on the cover, but, in reality, their features make up half of the disc. I have nothing against the T. & J. cartoons, but I already own about half of them on other T. & J. discs and I was looking for more Looney Tunes features. Okay, I could be faulted for not reading the fine print. Also, Warner Brothers is boldly printed across the top of the cover and the Looney Tunes offerings are indeed Warner Brothers. The T. & J. selections are MGM. Well, I guess in these days of mergers and acquisitions, a certain amount of  confusion reigns, but this  seems almost ridiculous.

The cartoons themselves are quite excellent and nicely restored. Supposedly, all are Academy Award winners, but one might wonder in which category such features ass the Three Little Kittens or the Health Feature fit. Oh well, the cartoons I enjoyed, except the mathematics one, all fit my  definition of fine movie cartoons and it's quite a good collection. The ""political correctness"" warning at the beginning was a turn-off, but some of the Looney Tunes cartoons were, indeed, politically incorrect. This doesn't bother me a bit in that it's a fact of our past and why correct it when you're showing works from the past?

In any case, my boy  and I watched this rather long-running DVD tonight and we were both laughing hard. My boy seems to prefer the Tom and Jerry features and his attention lapses  with  such features as Pe Pe Lapew, Speedy Gonzales and Yosemite Sam. It's a fine disc. I bought it off the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart and it's a marvelous entertainment bargain. I'd rate it at 4.5 for all those picky little things I brought up and then round it up to  five.

3043261,5,B000ZOXDKA,"This collection works on a couple of levels. For the Looney Tunes fans it fills in several cartoons that don't show up on any other collection, including the first true Bugs toon 'A Wild Hare', plus it's a great Tom & Jerry primer if, like me, you don't own all of the T & J boxed sets.  If you don't like Tom & Jerry you may have a problem since almost a third of the selections are T&J. The good news is that they are the cream of the crop as far as the cat and mouse go.

You also get an otherwise unavailable Tex Avery short 'Blitz Wolf' (c'mon WB where's the rest of Avery?) the first classic Superman short, an extended Popeye selection from the original classic 30's run, and several one-off cartoons from WB and MGM that you can only get here.

The original price might have given pause to those who already owned the Golden Collections  but, as of this posting, the Amazon price for this set is under $20, so what are you waiting for?

The next thing WB needs to get cracking on is releasing some non-Tom & Jerry MGM shorts. They put out the Droopy collection but there are many, many more classics from Tex Avery and others that gave Looney Tunes a real run for their money in the 40s and 50s.  For some reason WB has released a complete, authorized Tex Avery collection in France, but not here, which is criminal.",1337990400,,1324,4.276
3043262,4,B000ZOXDKA,"I collect the Looney Tunes Golden Collection sets.  After getting all six, I heard someone on the net suggest this one as a mean of filling in the remaining cartoons that weren't available in the golden collection sets.  After having looked at the sets somewhat, I am happy with what I have received, but the most of the Looney Tunes cartoons here were already in those other sets.  There was one cartoon I was looking forward to seeing ""The Dot and the Line.""  I was expecting something quite intriguing...and it was...but just not as good as I hope for.

So, all things considered, I guess I'm the happiest about receiving all of the Tom and Jerry and other cartoons.  They are nice to have access to.  Even then though, for having been Academy Award winners, they just weren't as amazing as I had hoped for.  I guess I'm happy I have it though.",1331856000,,847,4.490196078431373

Worth having for the new-to-DVD ""Peace on Earth"" (1939), ""Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt"" (1941), ""Rhapsody in Rivets"" (1941), ""Blitz Wolf"" (1942), ""Sandy Claws"" (1954) and ""High Note"" (1960). Unfortunately, 12 Oscar-nominated cartoons are inexplicably omitted from this collection  notably Chuck Jones' ""Beep Prepared"" (1961), Tex Avery's ""Detouring America"" (1939) and Harman-Ising's ""The Old Mill Pond"" (1936). Despite its shortcomings, the DVD set offers several mini-masterpieces from Warner, MGM and Fleischer.

You see, this year I stopped whining about how the great cartoons aren't on TV anymore and finally took the plunge with the DVDs. Mostly this means my favorites: The Looney Tunes and Popeye, but I quickly found 3 very good reasons to purchase this peripheral collection:

1. It features two MGM cartoons, The Dot and the Line and Peace on Earth, which have been favorites of mine since I was a very small child and I doubt they'll be released in any other cartoon set in the foreseeable future.

2. It contains three Bugs Bunny cartoons, one of which is not included on any of the Looney Tunes releases (Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt) and one which is beautifully restored here while on the Looney Tunes set it was included as a special feature with a crap, old, faded print (A Wild Hare - the very first Bugs Bunny cartoon!).

3. Tom and Jerry. I always liked T&J, but didn't love them - so it's good to have a nice sample of the series in this set. Over a dozen Tom and Jerry toons are present as they were popular with the academy.

...after I bought the collection I discovered it had another plus: a terrific documentary on the Best Animated Short Oscar.",1293494400,,1208,4.403587443946188

3043279,3,B000ZOXDKA,"When it has come down to it, Warner Brothers has made large and smaller compilations of their classic Looney Tunes cartoons over the years, as the Golden and Spotlight Collections. While the Golden Collectioons have all been worth the effort and the money to buy, the smaller collections haven't really brought in the die hard fans as well. Now that it is soon time for the Academy Awards, it will be time to see who is the best in animation, and it is most likely Disney's Ratatouille. But back in the 40's, 50's and 60's it was Disney against Hanna-Barbera, Warner Brothers and M.G.M. to see who was the best in shorts. Now Warner Brothers, M.G.M. and Hanna-Barbera have all of their Oscar-Winning cartoons on one DVD compilation. But, does it really say That's All Folks!?

Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection - The 15 Winners, is a single disc DVD that contains all the Oscar-winning gems from Warner Brothers, M.G.M. and Hanna-Barbera from the golden days of animation. While the single disc shows the winners, it doesn't appeal as the recently issued 15 Winners, 26 Nominations 3 disc DVD set, which includes 42 animated gems and even classic that were released on DVD for the first time. On this smaller version, you mainly get the single disc of gems, most of them are highlighting shorts by Tom & Jerry and Sylvester who won 3 Oscars for Warner Brothers and director Friz Freleng. Still, on this single disc there are a lot of classic here including Birds Anonymous, where Sylvester goes into treatment for his addiction to go after Tweety, Bugs Bunny's only Oscar-winning short, Knighty Knight Bugs, and the controversial The Cat Concerto featuring Tom & Jerry, which was similarly like the Bugs Bunny cartoon Rhapsody Rabbit, and Pepe Le Pew in the Chuck Jones delight For Scent-imental Reasons. The episodes have all been remastered well, but doesn't appeal as much to newcomers to the classic gems of animation today.

All in all, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection - The 15 Winners is good for anyone who hasn't seen the great influences of animation today, it just doesn't measure up as well as the 3 disc expanded edition: 15 Winners 26 Nominees, which includes classics that have never made it to home video before like Bugs Bunny's debut in Tex Avery's A Wild Hare, and many other delights to laugh out loud to. As for this single disc set, it truly isn't all folks to stand alone completely for the Oscar these days.

3043280,4,B000ZOXDKA,"With the Academy Awards coming up soon, many moviegoers have been eagerly awaiting to see what film is the best of the best. Well, that also has been said with animated cartoons of the past. While Disney had won so many Oscar awards over the years, back in the 40's 50's and 60's, M.G.M., Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers all duked it out to see which company had the best in animation through Looney Tunes and classic gems in the spotlight. We've seen that appeal well with Tom & Jerry, and Sylvester winning so many Oscars from their shorts back during that height of animation, as well as other known gems get the nominatons, but faling shy of taking the prize. Now, those animated gems come together on one collection of nominees and Oscar-winners from the past.

Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection is a 3 disc DVD collection containing 42 animated shorts from the classic eras of golden animation that influenced the cartoons we see on television today. The shorts have all been restored nicely, and introduce the eras of greatness from gems by Friz Freleng, to the abstract inflluence of the legendary Chuck Jones, to the zaniness of Tex Avery. The first disc is all about the winners. All the cartoons on this first disc have taken the Oscar for best animated shorts, which include 3 shorts from Sylvester including Birds' Anonymous and Speedy Gonzales, to the controversial Tom & Jerry victory win of The Cat Concerto, which came about the same time as a Bugs Bunny gem which was similar called Rhapsody Rabbit, all the way to the Chuck Jones gems like The Dot & The Line and Pepe Le Pew's classic For Scent-imental Reasons, and Bugs Bunny's only Oscar-winning gem, Knighty Knight Bugs.

The second and third discs each contain greats that were at one time nominated for the Oscar, but fell short of collecting the prize. Some of these greats are here for the very first time on DVD including A Wild Hare, which Tex Avery helped in developing the debut of Bugs Bunny, as well as classic cult hits like the abstract use of sound effects to tell a story in the Chuck Jones great Now Hear This, What's Cookin' Doc? as a bonus where Bugs is invited to The Oscars but feels disgraced of losing to James Cagney, and Little Johnny Jet from M.G.M., which was one of the classic that helped influence movies like Disney's Cars, where a old-defeated fighter plane and his wife become proud arents of a baby jet plane.

All in all, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection- 15 Winners,26 Nominees is a great buy for anyone who is into classic animation from the past, and any die hard fan of Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes or just shorts that make you laugh out loud. It also is a delightful sampler for anyone who has yet to see the influences of the past that helped make great animation today. I really think this is a great compilation of greats from Warner Brothers, M.G.M. and Hanna-Barbera all in one that should be in your DVD collection. That is all Oscar Folks!

3043281,5,B000ZOXDKA,The Academy Awards Animation Collection is a great collection with some of the best cartoons ever made on it. The two best cartoons on this collection are Peace On Earth and the Remake Good Will to Men. Plus the Bugs Bunny Cartoon A Wild Hare with the original Title Cards. The Cartoons on the collection are Restored and Remastered very well.,1203465600,2,343,4.639344262295082
3043282,4,B000ZOXDKA,"This disc is worth purchasing for the following cartoons ALONE:

PEACE ON EARTH
GOOD WILL TO MEN
THE BLITZ WOLF
NELLIE'S FOLLY
NOW HEAR THIS
THE DOT AND THE LINE
A WILD HARE
PUSS GETS THE BOOT (a much better cartoon than many later Tom and Jerries that won the award)
and especially FROM A TO Z-Z-Z-Z.

None of these have appeared on DVD before. The last one is worth the price, all by itself. I've been waiting for years for Ralph Phillips to appear on disc.

Now, the idea of Oscar nominated and winning animation is a great one...but why are so many of the cartoons available elsewhere? Why are there no entries before 1940? (The Short Cartoon oscar began in 1932, and Disney won every year until 1940, when the rather disgusting MILKY WAY (included here) beat the much better nominees PLUTO'S BONE TROUBLE, A WILD HARE and the first Woody Woodpecker cartoon KNOCK KNOCK

There's no accounting for taste, and it is clear that many of the best cartoons on this disc are in the Nominees section, rather than the Winners.

I'd like to thank Warners for putting Tex Avery's completely politically-incorrect THE BLITZ WOLF and Bob Clampett's WHAT'S COOKIN' DOC on disc for the first time. I never thought these cartoons would be released at all. Now let's have the rest of the Averys!",1203120000,16,1282,4.605263157894737
3043283,5,B000ZOXDKA,"Despite the omissions which I'm sure that most animation fans have heard about already, I would give this set a high ""thunb's up!""

Most of the cartoons here look and sound better than I'd seen them on previous collections, and it is so nice to have rare titles like ""FROM A TO Z-Z-Z-Z"" and both ""PEACE ON EARTH"" and ""GOOD WILL TO MEN"" on the same collection.  Also, on the first disk of this set, ""SO MUCH FOR SO FEW"" is a gloriously restored part of the main program, not a special feature as it was on one of the LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION volumes.  Notable titles are restored with first-time-in-a-long-time seen title cards also finally returned to them, like ""HIAWATHA'S RABBIT HUNT"" and ""A WILD HARE"", the cartoon that started it all for the BUGS BUNNY we all know and love, and I also rather like having ""THE DOT AND THE LINE"" as part of the main program, as opposed to it being a special feature on the movie, ""THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT"".  The whole point of this set is both to honor the cartoon as art form and to show that the Academy was not all that receptive to honoring these wonderful artists outside of the usual Disney nod.  It is no wonder that all or most other studios were trying to *BE* Disney instead of having faith in their own incredible style as did the Fleischers, who were ultimately forced to bow to Disney as well during their last fading days at Paramount.  Through the commentaries, we get a sense of just who did what and that, no matter who the director of any given cartoon, it ttakes the good efforts of an entire animation staff to get the job done right.

Terrific stuff, and wouldn't it be delightful if we could have more of these kinds of animation packages with one basic theme, mixing up the other studios as well, as a kind of homage to the days when local animation festivals or Saturday matinees were the norm.  Theaters are the best way to see these cartoons, but this will do when the best is no longer available to us!",1202947200,19,1970,4.392857142857143
3277677,5,B000ZOXDKA,"Don't you just hate it when the description of one of these classic cartoon sets doesn't include a description of the cartoons? In this case, they are really worth mentioning, as some, such as Disc Two's ""Peace on Earth,"" aren't exactly kiddie fare, and many others are true animation classics (I've starred the ones I think best earn that honor). With that in mind, here's a description of each cartoon, written as I watch them:

DISC ONE

Each of these was honored by the Academy as the Best Cartoon of the Year:

1. THE MILKY WAY* (MGM, 1940)
Clear color, great clarity and a nice period song highlight this restored cute classic. When three little kittens lose their mittens, they're sent straight to bed -- where they dream that they sail a hot air balloon up into the Milky Way, a land overflowing with milk geysers and springs. The cartoon was the first Oscar winner that wasn't produced by Disney.

2. YANKEE DOODLE MOUSE* (MGM, 1943)
Typical Tom and Jerry antics doused in patriotic instrumentals such as ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""Over There."" Dynamite, egg grenades and champagne-bottle corks are the weapons of choice. I'll admit I'm not the biggest Tom & Jerry fan, but my 13-year-old daughter loves this one.

3. MOUSE TROUBLE (MGM, 1944)
Tom's the one in trouble as he attempts to rid the house of Jerry, using the ideas in a book called ""How to Catch a Mouse (A Random Mouse Book).""

4. QUIET PLEASE* (MGM, 1945)
Even I like this one. In fact, I LOVE this one! Though it's directed by Hanna and Barbera, Tex Avery's jaw-dropping influence is all through it. Funny gags, great character expressions! When a sleepy Spike threatens to kill Tom if the cat doesn't keep quiet (""If I hear one more sound I've gonna skin you alive, get it?""), Jerry tries to make as much noise as he can. Optional audio commentary by animator Mark Kausler highlights the contributions from many former Disney artists.

5. THE CAT CONCERTO* (MGM, 1947)
When Jerry disrupts Tom's grand piano performance of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody, Tom fights back while never missing a note. Optional audio commentary by animator Eric Goldberg. You know, I'm really starting to get into this Tom & Jerry stuff!

6. TWEETIE PIE* (Warner Bros., 1947)
A cat (here named Thomas, later known as Sylvester) uses a variety of screwball techniques as he tries to catch the little yellow bird in a series of short sketches. Vivid color! The first Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, and the first Warner Bros. short to win an Oscar.

7. THE LITTLE ORPHAN (MGM, 1949)
Tiny mouse Nibbles is always hungry, which causes trouble for Jerry.

8. FOR SCENT-IMENTAL REASONS* (Warner Bros., 1949)
The debut of Pep Le Pew (my favorite Chuck Jones character), an amorous skunk who mistakes a black female cat for a potential mate. Pep's influence can be seen in the Disney characters Lumiere from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B00003CX8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast</a>&nbsp;as well as Capt.

Optional audio commentary by animator Greg Ford.

9. SO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE (Warner Bros., 1949)
This 10-minute animated PSA won the 1949 Oscar for Best Documentary Short. Its point: how federal public-health services can keep babies healthy and free from diseases. Cute, and better than it sounds, though scenes include such things as ""untreated sewage running into our pretty creek."" Optional audio commentary by animation historian Jerry Beck.

10. THE TWO MOUSEKETEERS (MGM, 1951)
Musketeers Jerry and Nibbles cause trouble for Royal Guard Tom at a king's banquet. Routine.

11. JOHANN MOUSE (MGM, 1952)
Tom learns to play the piano in an effort to catch Jerry, who can't help but dance whenever he hears a Johann Strauss waltz. MGM debuted a new-look Tom with this short, in which he first appears without the grey stripe between his eyes.

12. SPEEDY GONZALES* (Warner Bros., 1955)
They couldn't make this one today! To help his starving friends, the Mexican Don Juan mouse must sneak past makeshift border guard Sylvester and raid a U.S. cheese factory. When one of the friends proclaims ""Speedy Gonzales a friend of my sister!"" another replies ""Speedy Gonzales friend of everybody's sister. Optional music-only audio track.

13. BIRDS ANONYMOUS (Warner Bros., 1957)
Sylvester tries to break his addiction to feathered food by joining Birds Anonymous, but the temptation of Tweety is too much. Includes the first appearance of Sylvester's fellow feline, Sam.

14. KNIGHTY-KNIGHT BUGS (Warner Bros., 1958)
On a quest for a Singing Sword, Bugs Bunny sneaks into the castle of the Black Knight, where he meets a fire-breathing, but sneezing dragon. Song: ""Cuddle Up a Little Closer.""

15. THE DOT AND THE LINE* (MGM, 1965)
A line loves a dot, but she's hot for a squiggle in this charming, colorful and witty 10-minute Chuck Jones gem. Subtitled ""A Romance in Lower Mathematics,"" it's based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-1963-book/dp/1587170663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the 1963 book</a>&nbsp;by architect and children's author Norton Juster. Optional audio commentary by Eric Goldberg. Optional music-only audio track.

DISC TWO

1. POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS SINBAD THE SAILOR* (Paramount /Fleischer, 1936)
When Sinbad (i.e., Bluto) challenges Popeye to a series of battles, the big brute nearly wins until Popeye pulls out his can of spinach. Many scenes use modeled sets to create three-dimensional backgrounds. 16 minutes, color. Optional audio commentary by Jerry Beck, illustrator Leslie Cabarga and animators Ray Pointer and Bob Jaques.

2. PEACE ON EARTH* (MGM, 1939)
A chilling classic. During a post-apocalyptic Christmas Eve, two young squirrels ask their grandfather what the word ""men"" means in the lyric ""Peace on earth, good will to men."" As he explains that man was the species that destroyed itself by waging war, the cartoon shows rotoscoped scenes of armed conflict. Optional audio commentary by Greg Ford.

3. A WILD HARE* (Warner Bros., 1940)
The first official Bugs Bunny cartoon looks primitive by later standards, but still has all the ingredients of the rascally rabbit's recipe. When ""wabbit"" hunter Elmer Fudd sticks his rifle down a hole, up pops Bugs to ask ""What's up, Doc?"" Optional audio commentary by Greg Ford.

4. PUSS GETS THE BOOT* (MGM, 1940)
Tom is called Jaspar in this early version of a Tom and Jerry short. A typical cat-and-mouse chase results in a number of broken household objects. Optional audio commentary by Mark Kausler.

5. SUPERMAN* (Paramount /Fleischer, 1941)
The classic story of The Man Of Steel as told in a 10-minute animated short, including his early life in rural Kansas. Later, he works with Perry White and Lois Lane at The Daily Planet as Clark Kent, but must change into Superman to save Lois, and the world, from a mad scientist. The first Superman cartoon. Optional audio commentary by producer Paul Dini.

6. HIAWATHA'S RABBIT HUNT (Warner Bros., 1941)
When an Elmer Fudd-like Hiawatha (from the classic Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Song-of-Hiawatha/dp/0486447952/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Song of Hiawatha</a>) arrives in the forest hunting rabbits for dinner, Bugs will have none of it.

7. RHAPSODY IN RIVETS* (Warner Bros., 1941)
Ever seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia-2000-s/dp/B00003CWPX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia 2000's</a>&nbsp;version of ""Rhapsody in Blue""? Here's an obvious inspiration. A construction site foreman imagines himself as as conductor of Franz Liszt's ""Hungarian Rhapsody,"" with his workers as the orchestra.

8. THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS (MGM, 1941)
Tom chases Jerry under and around a Christmas tree until -- holy cats! -- he is touched by the holiday spirit.

9. THE BLITZ WOLF* (MGM, 1942)
When the evil Adolph Wolf wants to invade the state of Pigmania, Sergeant Pork spoils his plans. A wartime take on ""The Three Little Pigs."" Optional audio commentary by Eric Goldberg.

10. PIGS IN A POLKA* (Warner Bros., 1942)
In a parody of Disney's 1940 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia</a>, The Big Bad Wolf channels the spirit of Deems Taylor as he introduces a spoof of the Three Little Pigs set to a classical music piece, in this case Brahms' ""Hungarian Dances.""

11. SWOONER CROONER* (Warner Bros., 1944)
Frank Sinatra, Cab Calloway, Jimmy Durante and Al Jolson are among the crooners caricatured as Porky Pig holds a contest to help his hens lay more eggs. Songs include ""As Time Goes By,"" ""Shortenin' Bread,"" ""Lullaby of Broadway"" and ""You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby.""

12. WALKY TALKY HAWKY* (Warner Bros., 1946)
When naive young chicken hawk Henery comes across Foghorn Leghorn, the rooster proclaims ""I'm a horse!"" and proceeds to convince the little bird that the real chicken is the Barnyard Dog. ""Ooh!"" says Henery. ""That's the biggest chicken I ever did see!"" Optional audio commentary by Jerry Beck.

Every idea backfires when Tom tries to stop Jerry from drinking from a milk bowl.

14. MOUSE WRECKERS (Warner Bros., 1948)

The first Warner Bros. short to feature the company's revised graphic titles, it also includes a rarely heard rendition of ""The Merry Go-Round Broke Down."" Optional audio commentary by Amid Amidi.

There are two nice bonus features. ""Drawn for Glory: Animation's Triumph at the Oscars"" is a new 60-minute, clip-heavy documentary that covers all the major studios. ""What's Cookin' Doc?"" is a 1944 Bugs Bunny short that shows the rabbit at an Academy Awards ceremony fighting to win the Oscar for ""Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt.""

Academy Awards Animation Collection - 15 Winners, 26 Nominees</a>. It's this disc plus two more, with many other gems, all at a good price.

Here's a description of the cartoons on this DVD. I've starred my favorites:

1. THE MILKY WAY* (MGM, 1940)
Clear color, great clarity and a nice period song highlight this restored cute classic. When three little kittens lose their mittens, they're sent straight to bed -- where they dream that they sail a hot air balloon up into the Milky Way, a land overflowing with milk geysers and springs. The cartoon was the first Oscar winner that wasn't produced by Disney.

2. YANKEE DOODLE MOUSE* (MGM, 1943)
Typical Tom and Jerry antics doused in patriotic instrumentals such as ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""Over There."" Dynamite, egg grenades and champagne-bottle corks are the weapons of choice. I'll admit I'm not the biggest Tom & Jerry fan, but my 13-year-old daughter loves this one.

3. MOUSE TROUBLE (MGM, 1944)
Tom's the one in trouble as he attempts to rid the house of Jerry, using the ideas in a book called ""How to Catch a Mouse (A Random Mouse Book).""

4. QUIET PLEASE* (MGM, 1945)
Even I like this one. In fact, I LOVE this one! Though it's directed by Hanna and Barbera, Tex Avery's jaw-dropping influence is all through it. Funny gags, great character expressions! When a sleepy Spike threatens to kill Tom if the cat doesn't keep quiet (""If I hear one more sound I've gonna skin you alive, get it?""), Jerry tries to make as much noise as he can. Optional audio commentary by animator Mark Kausler highlights the contributions from many former Disney artists.

5. THE CAT CONCERTO* (MGM, 1947)
When Jerry disrupts Tom's grand piano performance of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody, Tom fights back while never missing a note. Optional audio commentary by animator Eric Goldberg. You know, I'm really starting to get into this Tom & Jerry stuff!

6. TWEETIE PIE* (Warner Bros., 1947)
A cat (here named Thomas, later known as Sylvester) uses a variety of screwball techniques as he tries to catch the little yellow bird in a series of short sketches. Vivid color! The first Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, and the first Warner Bros. short to win an Oscar.

7. THE LITTLE ORPHAN (MGM, 1949)
Tiny mouse Nibbles is always hungry, which causes trouble for Jerry.

8. FOR SCENT-IMENTAL REASONS* (Warner Bros., 1949)
The debut of Pep Le Pew (my favorite Chuck Jones character), an amorous skunk who mistakes a black female cat for a potential mate. Pep's influence can be seen in the Disney characters Lumiere from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B00003CX8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast</a>&nbsp;as well as Capt. Jack Sparrow from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean/dp/B00005JM5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>&nbsp;films. Optional audio commentary by animator Greg Ford.

9. SO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE (Warner Bros., 1949)
This 10-minute animated PSA won the 1949 Oscar for Best Documentary Short. Its point: how federal public-health services can keep babies healthy and free from diseases. Cute, and better than it sounds, though scenes include such things as ""untreated sewage running into our pretty creek."" Optional audio commentary by animation historian Jerry Beck.

10. THE TWO MOUSEKETEERS (MGM, 1951)
Musketeers Jerry and Nibbles cause trouble for Royal Guard Tom at a king's banquet. Routine.

11. JOHANN MOUSE (MGM, 1952)
Tom learns to play the piano in an effort to catch Jerry, who can't help but dance whenever he hears a Johann Strauss waltz. MGM debuted a new-look Tom with this short, in which he first appears without the grey stripe between his eyes.

12. SPEEDY GONZALES* (Warner Bros., 1955)
They couldn't make this one today! To help his starving friends, the Mexican Don Juan mouse must sneak past makeshift border guard Sylvester and raid a U.S. cheese factory. When one of the friends proclaims ""Speedy Gonzales a friend of my sister!"" another replies ""Speedy Gonzales friend of everybody's sister."" Optional music-only audio track.

13. BIRDS ANONYMOUS (Warner Bros., 1957)
Sylvester tries to break his addiction to feathered food by joining Birds Anonymous, but the temptation of Tweety is too much. Includes the first appearance of Sylvester's fellow feline, Sam.

14. KNIGHTY-KNIGHT BUGS (Warner Bros., 1958)
On a quest for a Singing Sword, Bugs Bunny sneaks into the castle of the Black Knight, where he meets a fire-breathing, but sneezing dragon. Song: ""Cuddle Up a Little Closer.""

15. THE DOT AND THE LINE* (MGM, 1965)
A line loves a dot, but she's hot for a squiggle in this charming, colorful and witty 10-minute Chuck Jones gem. Subtitled ""A Romance in Lower Mathematics,"" it's based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-1963-book/dp/1587170663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the 1963 book</a>&nbsp;by architect and children's author Norton Juster.

3277692,5,B000ZOXDKA,"Just in time for the Oscars, this is 1 elite collection of beloved or rare shorts from the WB, MGM, and the Fleischer studios at Paramount, all of which had Oscar nominations and 15 of them are winners! There's 41 Golden Age shorts in all in this 3-disc collection, including all 13 Tom and Jerry shorts that had such an honor, including all 7 winners! They're all uncut and unedited, too! A lot of folks are still upset today, even me, that the WB never bothered to make a 4th disc containing at least 12 more nominated toon classics by the WB and MGM for this set, plus 2 more Fleischer shorts that were Oscar-nominated that the WB doesn't own, despite those 2 being in the Public Domain! Most notably excluded are Rhapsody Rabbit and Canary Row, so you can compare the former and The Cat Concerto for yourselves, and the latter was withdrawn to let For Scent-imental Reasons take its place, finally giving Chuck Jones his due when it won! You never know what kind of classic you'll see next with this set, and this is no Public Domain collection; it's an authorized collection by the WB, with a ton of bonus features, including an hour-long documentary about the history of the Oscars, especially with animation, and the 1944 un-nominated short What's Cookin', Doc?, featuring Bugs Bunny at the Oscars! This collection's a must-own for fans of classic toons, even for the toons that had involvement with the Oscars! Other reviewers here will let you in on what's in this prestigious, prodigious, collection, so's not to copy them! It's a wonder Disney never made a home video collection of Oscar-worthy toons quite like this, from Mickey's Orphans from 1931 to Feast from 2014!

The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill. If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.

3277723,5,B000ZOXDKA,"This is perhaps the ultimate animation collection for classic cartoons from rival studios, though also controversial. I don't really appreciate that Bugs Bunny only won one Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject (out of just three nominations, no less) while Tom and Jerry won seven (not that I don't like Tom and Jerry, I just think that Bugs is the best cartoon character of all time). I'm very surprised that Bugs' was never even nominated for his hit shorts like ""Baseball Bugs,"" ""Bugs Bunny Rides Again,"" and ""What's Opera, Doc?"" I guess Bugs was like the John Wayne of cartoons; immensely popular among the public, but only winning one Oscar late in his career. I'm also surprised that Popeye only got a single Oscar nomination for all his success, and that ""Popeye the Sailor meets Sinbad the Sailor"" didn't even win the award. Still, this is one awesome DVD set. Just about all these classic theatrical cartoons from Warner Bros., MGM and Paramount were what I grew up watching on Cartoon Network in the '90s (back when Cartoon Network was awesome). I definitely recommend this. The inclusion of the Bugs Bunny short ""What's Cooking, Doc?"" and the documentary ""Drawn for Glory"" as bonus material is also very nice.",1406851200,,1228,4.880382775119617

But WB cartoon fans beware that of the 15 items in this package from the 1940s & 50s, 9 are MGM ( 7 Tom and Jerry, 1 Three Little Kittens, and 1 Chuck Jones modern abstraction ""The Dot & the Line"").The remaining 6 are WB, but 1 is a Public Health Service animation rewarded only as serious health publicity. So this package contains only 5 WB cartoons (all available on VHS & DVD sets before) and does not include characters (.e.g. Foghorn Leghorn) who appear in the cover art. A great case of false advertisement by imagery. I know Warner Brothers currently owns the MGM archive and via Turner Entertainment has given us great DVD movie transfers at great prices, but the deception used on the cartoons here is not necessary.

3277747,5,B000ZOXDKA,"I've been buying a number of DVDs of restored cartoons from the days of about late WWII through 1960. The reason I wanted them is that I really enjoyed these cartoons as a kid on my visits to the movie houses. The movies functioned as our TV. Plus, these were really great cartoons, much better than modern animated cartoons, in my opinion. I get a kick out of them, of course, but I'm really buying them for my little boy (4 1/2) and I get great enjoyment out of seeing him gleefully laughing, just as I did as a kid. My latest acquisition is the ""Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection - 15 Winners"" DVD. I'm spelling this out completely, because many of the reviews as listed here don't fit this particular disc that is for sale. The disc is listed plainly and simply but the reviews are from two and three disc compilations. This is one disc with 15 features plus a few extras.

I find the cover of the disc to be somewhat misleading. A casual observer, such  as me, would look at the disc and assume that the contents were mostly of the Looney Tunes cartoons, because that's what is illustrated. Tom and Jerry are only two of the nine characters shown on the cover, but, in reality, their features make up half of the disc. I have nothing against the T. & J. cartoons, but I already own about half of them on other T. & J. discs and I was looking for more Looney Tunes features. Okay, I could be faulted for not reading the fine print. Also, Warner Brothers is boldly printed across the top of the cover and the Looney Tunes offerings are indeed Warner Brothers. The T. & J. selections are MGM. Well, I guess in these days of mergers and acquisitions, a certain amount of  confusion reigns, but this  seems almost ridiculous.

The cartoons themselves are quite excellent and nicely restored. Supposedly, all are Academy Award winners, but one might wonder in which category such features ass the Three Little Kittens or the Health Feature fit. Oh well, the cartoons I enjoyed, except the mathematics one, all fit my  definition of fine movie cartoons and it's quite a good collection. The ""political correctness"" warning at the beginning was a turn-off, but some of the Looney Tunes cartoons were, indeed, politically incorrect. This doesn't bother me a bit in that it's a fact of our past and why correct it when you're showing works from the past?

In any case, my boy  and I watched this rather long-running DVD tonight and we were both laughing hard. My boy seems to prefer the Tom and Jerry features and his attention lapses  with  such features as Pe Pe Lapew, Speedy Gonzales and Yosemite Sam. It's a fine disc. I bought it off the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart and it's a marvelous entertainment bargain. I'd rate it at 4.5 for all those picky little things I brought up and then round it up to  five.

3277758,5,B000ZOXDKA,"This collection works on a couple of levels. For the Looney Tunes fans it fills in several cartoons that don't show up on any other collection, including the first true Bugs toon 'A Wild Hare', plus it's a great Tom & Jerry primer if, like me, you don't own all of the T & J boxed sets.  If you don't like Tom & Jerry you may have a problem since almost a third of the selections are T&J. The good news is that they are the cream of the crop as far as the cat and mouse go.

You also get an otherwise unavailable Tex Avery short 'Blitz Wolf' (c'mon WB where's the rest of Avery?) the first classic Superman short, an extended Popeye selection from the original classic 30's run, and several one-off cartoons from WB and MGM that you can only get here.

The original price might have given pause to those who already owned the Golden Collections  but, as of this posting, the Amazon price for this set is under $20, so what are you waiting for?

The next thing WB needs to get cracking on is releasing some non-Tom & Jerry MGM shorts. They put out the Droopy collection but there are many, many more classics from Tex Avery and others that gave Looney Tunes a real run for their money in the 40s and 50s.  For some reason WB has released a complete, authorized Tex Avery collection in France, but not here, which is criminal.",1337990400,,1324,4.276

There was one cartoon I was looking forward to seeing ""The Dot and the Line.""  I was expecting something quite intriguing...and it was...but just not as good as I hope for.

So, all things considered, I guess I'm the happiest about receiving all of the Tom and Jerry and other cartoons.  They are nice to have access to.

You see, this year I stopped whining about how the great cartoons aren't on TV anymore and finally took the plunge with the DVDs. Mostly this means my favorites: The Looney Tunes and Popeye, but I quickly found 3 very good reasons to purchase this peripheral collection:

1. It features two MGM cartoons, The Dot and the Line and Peace on Earth, which have been favorites of mine since I was a very small child and I doubt they'll be released in any other cartoon set in the foreseeable future.

2. It contains three Bugs Bunny cartoons, one of which is not included on any of the Looney Tunes releases (Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt) and one which is beautifully restored here while on the Looney Tunes set it was included as a special feature with a crap, old, faded print (A Wild Hare - the very first Bugs Bunny cartoon!).

3. Tom and Jerry. I always liked T&J, but didn't love them - so it's good to have a nice sample of the series in this set. Over a dozen Tom and Jerry toons are present as they were popular with the academy.

3277776,3,B000ZOXDKA,"When it has come down to it, Warner Brothers has made large and smaller compilations of their classic Looney Tunes cartoons over the years, as the Golden and Spotlight Collections. While the Golden Collectioons have all been worth the effort and the money to buy, the smaller collections haven't really brought in the die hard fans as well. Now that it is soon time for the Academy Awards, it will be time to see who is the best in animation, and it is most likely Disney's Ratatouille. But back in the 40's, 50's and 60's it was Disney against Hanna-Barbera, Warner Brothers and M.G.M. to see who was the best in shorts. Now Warner Brothers, M.G.M. and Hanna-Barbera have all of their Oscar-Winning cartoons on one DVD compilation. But, does it really say That's All Folks!?

Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection - The 15 Winners, is a single disc DVD that contains all the Oscar-winning gems from Warner Brothers, M.G.M. and Hanna-Barbera from the golden days of animation. While the single disc shows the winners, it doesn't appeal as the recently issued 15 Winners, 26 Nominations 3 disc DVD set, which includes 42 animated gems and even classic that were released on DVD for the first time. On this smaller version, you mainly get the single disc of gems, most of them are highlighting shorts by Tom & Jerry and Sylvester who won 3 Oscars for Warner Brothers and director Friz Freleng. Still, on this single disc there are a lot of classic here including Birds Anonymous, where Sylvester goes into treatment for his addiction to go after Tweety, Bugs Bunny's only Oscar-winning short, Knighty Knight Bugs, and the controversial The Cat Concerto featuring Tom & Jerry, which was similarly like the Bugs Bunny cartoon Rhapsody Rabbit, and Pepe Le Pew in the Chuck Jones delight For Scent-imental Reasons. The episodes have all been remastered well, but doesn't appeal as much to newcomers to the classic gems of animation today.

All in all, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection - The 15 Winners is good for anyone who hasn't seen the great influences of animation today, it just doesn't measure up as well as the 3 disc expanded edition: 15 Winners 26 Nominees, which includes classics that have never made it to home video before like Bugs Bunny's debut in Tex Avery's A Wild Hare, and many other delights to laugh out loud to. As for this single disc set, it truly isn't all folks to stand alone completely for the Oscar these days.

3277777,4,B000ZOXDKA,"With the Academy Awards coming up soon, many moviegoers have been eagerly awaiting to see what film is the best of the best. Well, that also has been said with animated cartoons of the past. While Disney had won so many Oscar awards over the years, back in the 40's 50's and 60's, M.G.M., Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers all duked it out to see which company had the best in animation through Looney Tunes and classic gems in the spotlight. We've seen that appeal well with Tom & Jerry, and Sylvester winning so many Oscars from their shorts back during that height of animation, as well as other known gems get the nominatons, but faling shy of taking the prize. Now, those animated gems come together on one collection of nominees and Oscar-winners from the past.

Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection is a 3 disc DVD collection containing 42 animated shorts from the classic eras of golden animation that influenced the cartoons we see on television today. The shorts have all been restored nicely, and introduce the eras of greatness from gems by Friz Freleng, to the abstract inflluence of the legendary Chuck Jones, to the zaniness of Tex Avery. The first disc is all about the winners. All the cartoons on this first disc have taken the Oscar for best animated shorts, which include 3 shorts from Sylvester including Birds' Anonymous and Speedy Gonzales, to the controversial Tom & Jerry victory win of The Cat Concerto, which came about the same time as a Bugs Bunny gem which was similar called Rhapsody Rabbit, all the way to the Chuck Jones gems like The Dot & The Line and Pepe Le Pew's classic For Scent-imental Reasons, and Bugs Bunny's only Oscar-winning gem, Knighty Knight Bugs.

The second and third discs each contain greats that were at one time nominated for the Oscar, but fell short of collecting the prize. Some of these greats are here for the very first time on DVD including A Wild Hare, which Tex Avery helped in developing the debut of Bugs Bunny, as well as classic cult hits like the abstract use of sound effects to tell a story in the Chuck Jones great Now Hear This, What's Cookin' Doc? as a bonus where Bugs is invited to The Oscars but feels disgraced of losing to James Cagney, and Little Johnny Jet from M.G.M., which was one of the classic that helped influence movies like Disney's Cars, where a old-defeated fighter plane and his wife become proud arents of a baby jet plane.

All in all, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection- 15 Winners,26 Nominees is a great buy for anyone who is into classic animation from the past, and any die hard fan of Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes or just shorts that make you laugh out loud. It also is a delightful sampler for anyone who has yet to see the influences of the past that helped make great animation today. I really think this is a great compilation of greats from Warner Brothers, M.G.M. and Hanna-Barbera all in one that should be in your DVD collection. That is all Oscar Folks!

3277778,5,B000ZOXDKA,The Academy Awards Animation Collection is a great collection with some of the best cartoons ever made on it. The two best cartoons on this collection are Peace On Earth and the Remake Good Will to Men. Plus the Bugs Bunny Cartoon A Wild Hare with the original Title Cards. The Cartoons on the collection are Restored and Remastered very well.,1203465600,2,343,4.639344262295082
3277779,4,B000ZOXDKA,"This disc is worth purchasing for the following cartoons ALONE:

PEACE ON EARTH
GOOD WILL TO MEN
THE BLITZ WOLF
NELLIE'S FOLLY
NOW HEAR THIS
THE DOT AND THE LINE
A WILD HARE
PUSS GETS THE BOOT (a much better cartoon than many later Tom and Jerries that won the award)
and especially FROM A TO Z-Z-Z-Z.

None of these have appeared on DVD before. The last one is worth the price, all by itself. I've been waiting for years for Ralph Phillips to appear on disc.

Now, the idea of Oscar nominated and winning animation is a great one...but why are so many of the cartoons available elsewhere? Why are there no entries before 1940? (The Short Cartoon oscar began in 1932, and Disney won every year until 1940, when the rather disgusting MILKY WAY (included here) beat the much better nominees PLUTO'S BONE TROUBLE, A WILD HARE and the first Woody Woodpecker cartoon KNOCK KNOCK

There's no accounting for taste, and it is clear that many of the best cartoons on this disc are in the Nominees section, rather than the Winners.

I'd like to thank Warners for putting Tex Avery's completely politically-incorrect THE BLITZ WOLF and Bob Clampett's WHAT'S COOKIN' DOC on disc for the first time. I never thought these cartoons would be released at all. Now let's have the rest of the Averys!",1203120000,16,1282,4.605263157894737
3277780,5,B000ZOXDKA,"Despite the omissions which I'm sure that most animation fans have heard about already, I would give this set a high ""thunb's up!""

Most of the cartoons here look and sound better than I'd seen them on previous collections, and it is so nice to have rare titles like ""FROM A TO Z-Z-Z-Z"" and both ""PEACE ON EARTH"" and ""GOOD WILL TO MEN"" on the same collection.  Also, on the first disk of this set, ""SO MUCH FOR SO FEW"" is a gloriously restored part of the main program, not a special feature as it was on one of the LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION volumes.  Notable titles are restored with first-time-in-a-long-time seen title cards also finally returned to them, like ""HIAWATHA'S RABBIT HUNT"" and ""A WILD HARE"", the cartoon that started it all for the BUGS BUNNY we all know and love, and I also rather like having ""THE DOT AND THE LINE"" as part of the main program, as opposed to it being a special feature on the movie, ""THE GLASS BOTTOM BOAT"".  The whole point of this set is both to honor the cartoon as art form and to show that the Academy was not all that receptive to honoring these wonderful artists outside of the usual Disney nod.  It is no wonder that all or most other studios were trying to *BE* Disney instead of having faith in their own incredible style as did the Fleischers, who were ultimately forced to bow to Disney as well during their last fading days at Paramount.  Through the commentaries, we get a sense of just who did what and that, no matter who the director of any given cartoon, it ttakes the good efforts of an entire animation staff to get the job done right.

Terrific stuff, and wouldn't it be delightful if we could have more of these kinds of animation packages with one basic theme, mixing up the other studios as well, as a kind of homage to the days when local animation festivals or Saturday matinees were the norm.  Theaters are the best way to see these cartoons, but this will do when the best is no longer available to us!",1202947200,19,1970,4.392857142857143
