1689342,5,B000063BJ3,"Through the seller ""Rightaway today"" I received a six disc DVD set and was not at all disappointed with the quality. Probably bad timing though as I think it's now officially released a lot cheaper. The forerunner of all TV mini series it still holds up as the best ever produced. Nick Nolte as Tom could not have been better cast. I don't know what he is really like but it was as if he wasn't acting as his character was so convincing. Ed Azner played the kind of powerful support role like Burl Ives did in ""A Big Country"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof""

Unlike so many other mini series, the story line has some depth and sends us a question of what success and happiness are all about. I also picked up before seeing it on someone else's reveiw,the blooper in filming the World Trade Center. That was built in 1973 well after the time frame of the story. This series I fully recommend as a definate collectors item.",1156809600,11,917,4.300578034682081
1689343,5,B000063BJ3,"This was the measuring stick for Mini-Series until Roots came along. Excellent storyline and strong performances throughout. A very young Nick Nolte (although admittedly you have to stretch to accept him as a high school student!) gives the performance that put him on the path to stardom. Ed Asner as the head of the Jordache family gives one of his finest performances in a role mostly against type. All in all a terrific series that finally has made it to US DVD release.

Available on eBay, but be careful that you are ordering the US Region (Region 1) and not a European version (Region 2).",1153008000,29,595,4.666666666666667
1689344,5,B000063BJ3,"I remember watching this mini-series on TV for something like 13 wks & we NEVER missed an episode..But thats been SO LONG AGO! C'mon lets get it on DVD...This was & is an excellent movie... They put stupid, crappy ones on DVD-VHS...whay can't they put some classic mini sereis on like this one!!??",1150243200,55,297,4.622641509433962
1689375,5,B000063BJ3,"I'm very happy to have found this DVD. Turns out I could have ordered it before as I'm in Japan (Region 2, like UK).
This was a very 1970s-era show, a great time for TV and movies, still mostly pre-political correct and pre-formula. If you don't know the difference between then and now on those terms, then you're watching without thinking.
I like everything others have said about this series, but it amazes me that 13 reviews can go by without anyone even mentioning William Smith as Falconetti. This was for me the best villain-bully characterization I've ever seen. Every moment he was on screen was chilling. I couldn't believe he was merely acting.",1244764800,6,655,4.754385964912281
1689376,5,B000063BJ3,I bought this DVD and have enjoyed it so much! Some of my family was also looking for it.... so I kinda bought 5 copies of it! Great movie!,1238025600,,139,3.8275862068965516
1689377,5,B000063BJ3,"I was finally able to purchase this in a format that would work on my DVD player! I don't know why the other reviewer gave such a low score. The picture is DVD quality, but you got to remember the film was made in the 70's. All in all this was such a great DVD to finally own!",1238025600,,276,3.7758620689655173
1689378,2,B000063BJ3,"Actually, this is a DVD-R. The show is good, and it is difficult to locate a copy in region one format, so I took a chance on this. The picture quality is not too bad, but it should be much better.

While it is great to finally have a chance to own the complete version of this program, the quality of this product does not match the price. This is a better quality set than Book 2, but that's not saying much. I'd suggest you keep looking.",1237766400,2,440,4.057471264367816
1689379,1,B000063BJ3,"Rich Man Poor Man was a great miniseries, for the time.  However, I now find the quality of the filming very poor, and the acting minimal. Also, watching segments made for TV was better suited for this cut. Finally, I looked for months for a version to play on my DVD player. I finally gave up, and ordered a ""multi country"" DVD player.  When the RMPM DVD arrived, it was able to play on my DVD.  The business that sold me the new DVD player would not allow me to return it. Expensive movie, huh.",1230336000,5,496,4.2
1689380,5,B000063BJ3,"One of the most memorable & well acted mini-series EVER.  I check to see if it has been released on DVD every month.  So where is it????????  I just don't understand why this fantastic mini-series has yet to be released on DVD in the good old USA.  I have a region 2 player, but I
keep holding out for a Region 1 release.  I'm always sure it is just around the corner, but............",1225756800,,384,4.205479452054795

1689382,5,B000063BJ3,"This was a great mini-series.  Right up there with ""The Thorn Birds"",""Shogun"" and ""Roots"".  I check ever so often to see if it has been released.  God knows what the hold up is since it has been released in DVD form for Region 2.
Hopefully someone will get wise and put it on DVD.  So much junk makes it to DVD....it is a shame this has not been out for years.  I am sure it would sell well.",1218412800,3,391,3.9615384615384617
1689383,5,B000063BJ3,"Oh, how time has flown by.  When you watch Nick Nolte in ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", it really makes you realize how long it has been since this wonderful mini series first debuted on TV--1976! Over 30 years ago! I was 12 at the time and I still fondly remember the show.  What a great cast RMPM has: Mr. Nolte (blond and gorgeous and oh so young), Peter Strauss (handsome as the uptight rich brother), Susan Blakely (what a terrific actress she was--haven't seen her in years), Ed Asner (who won an Emmy for his portrayal of Axel Jordache--a character radically different from Lou Grant), the late Bill Bixby (playing the pathetic Willie), Robert Reed (who proved he could play someone other than Mike Brady--he eats up the scenery in a delicious role) and Kim Darby (she's a hoot as the scheming psychotic Virginia Calderwood).  The scene where Virginia pounds on Rudy Jordache's mansion screaming his name has stuck in my mind all these years.  And the heartbreaking ending is still so sad to watch.  I forgot to mention the beautiful Kay Lenz, who ends up marrying Nick Nolte in the final episode.  She's a delight (another great actress who has disappeared).  Unfortunately, the mini series is not available in the United States for some mysterious reason, but you can buy a Region 2 PAL DVD.  If you have fond memories of this show--as I do--get yourself a Multiregion DVD player so you can relive this wonderful mini series.  And ""Rich Man, Poor Man Book 2"" was just released overseas in the last few weeks--I can't wait to begin watching it!",1185494400,10,1543,4.6642066420664205

7959005,5,B000063BJ3,One reviewer stated that his DVD was actually a DVD-R.  The DVD I received is a real DVD with the picture & sound quality that you expect from a real DVD.  This is really a great mini-series with many stars of TV & film at the time it was made.  You will love this Rich Man Poor Man series!,1487203200,,290,3.8813559322033897

Insert it again ,which I have done several times. None of the books,1,2,or3 can be seen or played. I have never had this problem before with any of my DVD movies from Amazon.

7959009,1,B000063BJ3,"I can not rate this set of dvd's because I never received it from Zoverstock!!! I have seen this on T.V. Back in the 70's and read the book both were excellent. As of this review i am waiting for the my copy of the (3) Dvd Set of the Rich Man, Poor Man. I am in deeply in hopes that they do not mess up my order again or I will again be disappointed and will never trust or buy from them again. The only reason i'm buying it for the second time is because (1) I want a copy for my collection and (2) I believe in given the vendor a second chance to redeem themselves. I just found out that it doesn't look like i'm going to get my copy of this dvd because Zoverstock once again mess up my order!!!!!!! I am given a up date, yes its true Zoverstock screw me again, when I email them to see if they can make it right for me after they mess up again nothing, no responds to all my emails just another refund and they think thats would make it all right. What do all of you Amazon customers think about that situation with Zoverstock, would you be disapointed with them too? Let me answer that for all of you Amazon customers a big YES you will all feel the same way I do. This company think that after 2 times to get my copy of Rich Man, Poor Man they can give me a refund and let Amazon sweep this whole matter under a carpet I surely hope that it will not happen, I would like to see Amazon step up to make this right with me I think and hope that they will.
Now lets get to the review on Rich Man, Poor Man a T.V. Mini Series that was in the 70's tge author was Irwin Shaw it won 4 Golden Globes Awards. It stared 3 newcomers, Peter Strauss who played Rudy Jordache, Nick Nolte who played Tom Jordache, and Susan Blakely who played Rudy Girlfriend Julie Prescott. Ed Asner who played Axel Jordache, Dorothy McGuire who played Mary Jordache and it also stars Robert Reed,Dennis Dugan, Dick Butkus, Mike Evans, William Smith who played the bad guy Falcon Eddy. I will end this review for I do not want to give this story all away to you viewers but this story will tack you on a journey from decades to decades as Rudy will become a Senator and Tom a Boxer take my word this story gets good and for the whole 9 hours and 26 mins. you will not be disapointed to see how this story takes you on that journey!  Chow for now Richard W.",1342310400,,2329,4.019396551724138

Could not return because of the way I opened it. Out 30 bucks. Live and learn",1332028800,3,158,3.8181818181818183
7959011,5,B000063BJ3,"This movie, although perhaps not well known or reminded in America these days, is one of the best. You will likely book a few weeks and dedicate yourself watching it, episode by episode. You will be captivated every single minute. Don't forget to get Book 2, as it completes this one. An absolute must-have for classic lovers, don't miss it!",1279584000,2,341,4.7
7959012,5,B000063BJ3,One of the top 3 mini series of all time.  The story line was riveting and the acting was incredible.  This show put Nick Nolte and Peter Strauss on the map.  Ed Asner was amazing.  We can only hope to go back to this kind of great storytelling.,1278460800,3,245,4.041666666666667
7959013,1,B000063BJ3,"I was very disappointed in this purchase.  No where on the ad to buy it does it say what type of media form to play it on.  Consequently,  I could only watch it on my computer which is not (at the least to say) a comfortable format to watch this mini series.  Please make it very clear on the advertisement how a video can be played. I fully expected to see that the format should be able to play on any DVD player.  I have only watched the first disc... and that was painful to sit at the computer to watch it.  This wants
me to beg off ordering any future DVD movies from Amazon.",1271894400,8,581,4.008695652173913
