8054810,2,B0007ZCQ96,I have several Cathe F videos. Her cueing has taken a serious dive.  Her old videos have complex choreography which I like but the breakdown and cueing are excellent.  I don't know how you get worse with time and not better.,1482105600,,224,4.439024390243903
8054811,5,B0007ZCQ96,"I purchase this in addition to the -The Step F1004 Step Workout System...which is a great combination.  I used to go to the gym step class but that's about the only thing that I don't get bored of.  I loved it so I decided to do it at home and save myself the gym member ship.  I was looking at Amy Bento and Cathe since these are the 2 top search that comes up.  I love how Cathe starts building up each combination gradually and gives verbal cues, it helps for when I forget what the next combination move is.  It also helps that I don't ever end up on the wrong side of the steps and rewind forever to find out how i got there the first place.  The step, jump, pump is not for people with knee/foot issues.  Lot of high impact move.  But I think just about anyone can pick up the step blast and have fun.  Now the smaller step for me, due to space issue, is great since I'm 5'3 and have short legs.  But if you're taller I'd recommend getting the full gym size.  I used my fitbit so if I do the step blast 3 combination and not the challenge, it's about 30 minutes of ~5000 steps and a good sweating before going into work.  I loved feeling pump and energetic from this upbeat routine. Great program.",1449187200,5,1203,4.094017094017094
8054812,5,B0007ZCQ96,I love this video!!  I own many of Cathe's DVD's and know this one won't be gathering any dust anytime soon!!!,1444089600,,110,4.238095238095238
8054813,5,B0007ZCQ96,I love all her workouts!! This one is great for variety! Will continue collecting dvds from her. She emphasizes safety & her workouts are challenging.,1401840000,,150,5.04
8054814,5,B0007ZCQ96,"I really like this video. I am not a really dedicated exerciser, but after day one, I actually wanted to work on learning more of this routine. I do love knowing the hit songs that play in the background, and I love the dancey, somewhat challenging steps. They will take some practice to get them down, but it's also a good workout, so definitely worthwhile.",1331164800,2,358,4.523076923076923
8054815,5,B0007ZCQ96,"I love these workouts!  They have fun music, upbeat Cathe and interesting moves.  Cathe herself is having a blast and her enthusiasm is catching.  The music is upbeat and includes many recognizable songs, such as ""Kung Fu Fighting.""

There are lots of premixes, which also mix routines from both Step Blast and Step, Pump & Jump, so you have lots of alternatives.

STEP BLAST:

There isn't a lot of breakdown with the step moves.  If you're not familiar with Cathe's choreography, you might want to watch the workout a few times before trying it.  I love quick choreography so it wasn't a problem for me.

Other than the quick choreography, I would categorize this workout at intermediate. Cathe does the routine on a 6 inch step (with one riser on each side).  I make it more intense by using 2 risers on each side.

STEP, PUMP & JUMP

This workout alternates hi/lo cardio with weight moves.  The weight moves are quick and I don't think you can really build muscle with these.  I use this workout as more of a circuit training routine.

The Hi/Lo is particularly intense, but it's perfect for combining with weights.  It's also nice to do on its own when you want to workout, but not too intensely.

Since I like to do splits for my weight work, I mainly use this DVD for cardio.  I like to do the premix which includes the 3 routines of Step Blast and the hi/lo routines from Step, Pump & Jump.

If you want fun routines that aren't too tough, but will leave you smiling all day, then this DVD is for you.",1278892800,2,1508,4.437956204379562
8054816,4,B0007ZCQ96,"Interesting, but not advanced choreography lends itself to a consistently good, but not overly challenging workout.  I like the different options, so that you can make several different workouts from the same DVD.",1252886400,2,213,5.454545454545454
8054817,5,B0007ZCQ96,"Love this work out. The combos are not too long or monotonous. ""The Challenge"" is super fun and gets me so worked that I am dripping in sweat but getting the chills from exhaustion at the same time and I like that!",1252627200,,214,4.119047619047619
8054818,5,B0007ZCQ96,"This is one of my FAVORITE Cathe workouts!  The music and the moves are so much fun!

It also has a ton of premixes for when you are short on time or if you want to mix up the two workouts.",1174608000,7,189,3.5853658536585367
8054819,5,B0007ZCQ96,"This DVD was even better than I was expecting.  It is definately not for the beginners.  Her routines are complex and fast.  It took me a while to get the routines down, but now that I do, it is my favorite exercise DVD.",1173312000,12,220,4.069767441860465
