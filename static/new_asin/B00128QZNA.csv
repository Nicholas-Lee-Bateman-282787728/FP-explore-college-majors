8244735,5,B00128QZNA,"The Late Leslie Nielson play Santa in this cute holiday film. I wish that Disney or Hlmark Chanel would run

Santa takes the sleign for a run and falls out of his sleigh. He gets amnesia a few days before Christmas Eve. The elves lead by Tommy Davidson search for the missing Santa with a sorta Santa GPS.

There is Peter,a news reporter (Steven Eckholdt) who does not believe in Saint Nick. Nick falls out of sky near his car. He in in a relationship with Claire (Robin Lively), Her son (Max Morrow) know that Nick is Santa, Peter does not believe him.

It is pure Disney magic without ODing on special effects. It is magic like Disney is known for. It is worth seeing? Add it to your personal holiday film list and enjoy!

Lieslie Nielson can play Santa better than Tim Allen in my opinion!
