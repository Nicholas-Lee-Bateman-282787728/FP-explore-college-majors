8030166,5,B0002OXVFU,"Casablanca & The Maltese Falcon

These are the two most famous movies from the early 1940s that featured Humprrey Bogart. Bogart usually played criminals is many earlier movies (The Petrified Forest). I think his earlier movie High Sierra was a better drama than TMF. The 1941 version of TMF seems more comic than the first and better 1931 version. The Hollywood Production Code of 1934 censored most earlier movies (until modern times). Controversial issues were often featured before 1934. For more details read the individual reviews.

Casablanca (1942) begins in a city where many are waiting to flee abroad to flee the Nazis.  Rick runs a gambling casino and operates on the fringes of the law. He has protection from the Police Chief who has a curious personality and a fondness for Rick. Victor Laszlo escaped from the Gestapo and wants to go to America with his wife Ilse. [Why not London to operate with the Free French?]

The Maltese Falcon (1941) begins with a search for a missing woman. But this is only a ruse by a scheming woman to find a man. The sought object is a statue of a black bird which is believed to contain great wealth hidden behind its coat of enamel. This search of something for nothing ends in death and disappointment for its hunters. [Does this symbolize other activities?]",1414540800,,1307,4.769911504424779

8030168,3,B0002OXVFU,"This was a great deal and I'm glad that I picked them up, the big problem though came with the packaging.  The two movies were shrink wrapped together and in the shrink wrap there was a stick hold the two together.  It was impossible to get the sticker off without ripping the covers of the two cases!!! BIG THUMBS DOWN TO THAT.  The movies are great though.",1104019200,15,358,4.313432835820896
