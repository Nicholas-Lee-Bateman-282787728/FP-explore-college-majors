1428545,5,B00005J78F,"What a great movie. With one of the best villians of the 20th Century you can't go wrong. This movie is a pleasure to watch. The plot is remarkable. Controlling people using lobotimies and the implementation of the infernal ""drum"".Wow they had great ideas back then that won't be out of place today. The way they compelled you to watch the next chapter was brilliant. You know he will survive but wonder how does he escape. I tell you this movie deserved at least 3 oscars. The picture is perfect but the sound is average(when you are used to 5.1 surround then tell me again).How they got the picture like that I don't know. If you are a serial-movie fan or a classic movie collector even a film student. Buy this!!In a nutshell this movie lived up and exceeded the hype it generated and quite frankly this film is a masterpiece. One of the best movies of the 20th Century.",1094947200,7,873,4.4625
1428546,3,B00005J78F,"Henry Brandon -- a master character actor who usually played villains -- got his only leading role in this 1940 Republic serial, ""suggested by"" Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Brandon steals the film from the supporting players and the squadron of athletic henchmen (who do not speak -- eerie!).
The serial is about par for Republic. The plot concerns an archaeological search for the artifacts of Genghis Khan, but you won't care much. The story characters are sketchily written and competently if not brilliantly acted (although one must admire hero Robert Kellard's enthusiasm). There are the usual chases, fistfights, and narrow escapes for cliffhanger fans, and a good musical score.
As the treacherous warlord Fu Manchu, Henry Brandon's careful, eloquent performance is a masterpiece of economy. He speaks volumes with a swift extension of the forearm, a slight smirk, a raised eyebrow, a dramatic pause, a sly drawl. He even plays an effective bereavement scene. when he discovers one of his coterie has died. Brandon is far better than his material in this one.
The original negative of this serial was presumably unavailable, so the DVD producers had to make do with a copy. What survives looks like a good to excellent third-generation print in excellent physical condition. The image has more contrast and less detail than other DVDs, but it's certainly watchable and enjoyable.
All in all, a decent show made better by the leading actor.",1075248000,16,1449,5.118143459915612
1428547,4,B00005J78F,"Well put-together serial, made  wonderful by Brandon's believable performance as the villain. We have a host of usual types for this kind of film supporting Brandon: the dauntless young hero, the relentless older law enforcement official, the courageous sweet young thing, her sneaky female counterpart working with the villain, the requisite professors and experts and others, all lining up in a titanic struggle of good and evil to determine who rules India.  The cliffhanger endings involve a variety of fiendish plots by Fu Manchu to get rid of one or another of the heroes, so that the good guys are not just saved every episode by jumping out of a car at the last moment before it goes over the edge of a cliff or blows up .  The writers actually put together a scenario that goes in one direction from beginning to end.  It all comes down to Brandon as Fu Manchu though.  His is the only character with any depth and he creates a believable performance.  I also own the VHS of this serial and the DVD has been restored to far, far superior quality.  I recommend it if you are into this kind of entertainment.",1059523200,23,1115,4.601010101010101
1428548,3,B00005J78F,"I admit that if you are a fan of these delightful old series adventures, you'll thoroughly enjoy ""Drums of Fu Manchu"".  The DVD set includes an informative 12 page booklet entitled, ""The History of Fu Manchu"", written by Eric Hoffman, and also, among other things, a short documentary about the cinematic history of this grand, evil character.  It's clear that VCI Entertainment put a lot of effort into this ""digitally remastered"" video, and I find no fault with that effort.
With that said, I must admit that I was rather disappointed with the quality of the print that VCI Entertainment used, after they had put so much effort into the DVD's ""extras"".  Although this print of ""Drums"" is clean and well preserved (no scratches or artifacts), it is generally dark, indistinct, and murky with only a very limited gray-scale range.  It reminds me of the prints that used to be used for the late, late, late TV movies, before there was cable, that used third and fouth generation prints because they felt no one was watching anyway.
The DVD format has certainly raised the bar for what is acceptable, and not acceptable, when watching films in the comfort of our own homes.  I, for one, now demand a crisp, clear, clean print that does full justice to the original.  With all sorts of ""restorations"" now being offered that, in many cases, are better than the original release print of a film, I've become spoiled and quite critical.  And a film's age has nothing to do with it.  The DVD print of the Republic Serial, ""Jungle Girl"" (1941), is absolutely pristine!  It was made from a 35mm Master Positive Print that is as clear and clean as any I've seen.  The serial, ""Jungle Jim"" (1936), is also clean and clear, although not as sharp and crisp as ""Jungle Girl"".  Both of these serials were issued by VCI, so I suspect that what they used for ""Drums of Fu Manchu"" was the best they could find.  Still, it was disappointing to be expecting another ""Jungle Girl"", and receive such a mediocre print.  By the way, the absolutely worst print of a serial that I've purchased was ""The Three Musketeers"" produced by the Roan Group, a company that usually does pretty good work.  If these companies can't find a good print to work with, why do they even bother to reissue these movies?  I, for one, would be willing to wait until the negative was found, a fine grained, master print was  discovered (and I ""know"" they're out there), or the film was properly ""restored"" (emphasis on ""properly"").",1059177600,17,2484,4.675862068965517
1428549,2,B00005J78F,I enjoy watching serials from this era and I can definitely say that this one rates below average compared to others I have watched.,1052006400,2,132,4.541666666666667
1428550,5,B00005J78F,"I have two words to all potential buyers of this DVD: BUY IT! It is fantastic! This is probably one of the best movie serials ever made! Fifteen exciting chapters of trains wrecks, chases, car crashes, fights, fights and more fights, featuring one of the best villians in all of fiction, Dr. Fu Manchu. Brillantly played by Henry Brandon, whom most sf/ fantasy fans may know from John Carpenter's ""ASSAULT ON PRECEINT 13"". He is perhaps the best Fu in movie history, even better than Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee! He is that good, I kid you not! The serial is not based on the Sax Rohmer novel of the same name, but uses some of the plot of an earlier Fu novel and the Karloff film ""THE MASK OF FU MANCHU"". Normally this would make me an unhappy camper, but this serial is such a joy to watch and is so exciting, that I can forgive the producers for ignoring Rohmer's great book (""DRUMS"" is one of my favorite Fu novels). All of the cast is pretty good. I liked Gloria Franklin as Fu's daughter Fah Loo Suee although she mysteriously disappears from the proceedings after about 12 chapters. And fans of Universal horror films will be happy to see the familiar face of the fly-eating maniac Renfield from the Lugosi Dracula, Dwight Frye in a small role in the 5th chapter. And wait until you see Loki, the lead Dacoit, one of ""Fu Manchu's men-of-murder"". He's a hoot! The picture and sound on the DVD are very nice and the extra's give a nice history of both Fu Manchu and the serial. There is a nice booklet included with the ""HISTORY OF FU MANCHU"" by Eric Hoffman and a photo gallery on the dvd and star and director bios and filmographies. Let me close by saying: this is one great DVD. BUY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!!! - George Bauch.",1049241600,68,1735,4.40809968847352
1428551,5,B00005J78F,"Okay, I think this is one of the great serials.  It is much darker than many.  Many scenes have the feel of the horror and mystery movies of the times, and these scenes quite distinguish this as one of the more innovative serials.
Obviously, this is villian centered, and what an evil personage we have here!  The makeup is superb, and as a personification of evil, Fu Manchu makes the emporer Ming look like a Sunday School teacher.  He must have laid awake nights figuring out new and hideous ways to do away with his adversaries.  Looks like the daughter is growing up in Dad's footsteps, although she hasn't graduated yet from using poisonous cigarette fumes to overcome her victims.
This is good, old fashioned fun.  Anyone who quibbles, as one reviewer did, with petty details like the train engineer hearing a gunshot from several cars back shouldn't be watching serials anyway, because they have never been known for their plausibility.
If you're new to serials, this one should be fairly high up on your must see list.  And if you're already a committed collector, this should definitely be in your collection.",1023321600,7,1119,4.796875
1428552,4,B00005J78F,"William Witney has stated that of all his serials Drums was his favorite because it was so different from all his other serials in mood and atmosphere. Halliwells Film Guide indicates that Drums of Fu Manchu is a spirited rendering of an ideal serial theme. This is my favorite serial, the one I would take to a desert island. Other serial aficianados may disagree with me but I would guess that it appears on their top five or ten serial lists. Among its many assets: a plot that develops logically from chapter to chapter, a superb bravura performance by Henry Brandon as the villainous criminal mastermind, and a superb musical score by Cy Feuer. VCI's print is good but not great so do not expect a pristine print ala Republic Home Video but it is very watchable. One big improvement over the prints from other previous sources; you can see what's going on in the night scenes in chapters 10 through 15.",1013731200,6,907,4.604938271604938
1428553,5,B00005J78F,"If you can handle political incorrectness, you'll agree this serial can't be beat. It has the unspeakable Dr. Fu, his equally loathsome daughter, Fah Lo Suee, plus legions of serpents, insects and dacoits. Fu is a god among bad guys, happy to wreck a crowded passenger train just to kill one person. Even when he commands them to die pointlessly, his minions obey. This movie shows a world in constant motion, without reason or logic. In other words, it's pure fun. And at last it's available to the general public, for the first time since its theatrical release.",991267200,10,564,4.76530612244898
1428564,4,B00005J78F,"It's cheesy and it's politically incorrect, but it's a very good quality DVD transfer from a classic age of cinema.  The DVD is not exactly popping with bonus features, and the case is a bit flimsy, but this has been produced on a budget as a labor of love.  A treat for Fu Manchu fans!",1406592000,,286,4.181818181818182

1428566,4,B00005J78F,"Another nice serial from VCI.
As with most serials it takes more than one sitting
to watch it all due to the length, but not one
boring chapter in 15.",1367107200,,150,4.033333333333333
1428567,5,B00005J78F,"This is one of my most excellent purchases!  I rate this serial ""five bags of popcorn"".  It's got everything a seventy year old ""boy"" could want in a chapter play;  good action in the way of fights and chases and cliff-hanges; a solid pure-as-all-get-out hero; sharp, clear photography; exciting music to push the action forward---ever forwward(!); a good sense of place.  Though the genre targets a young audience the dialogue doesn't condescend; and, finally, it has one of the ""very best diabolical villains"" of all time---right up there with Ming the Merciless---in the initimable diabolical Fu Manchu, as protrayed by a damn good actor, Henry Brandon.
  This type of movie---we call it a genre these days---isn't for everybody.  It takes the uncluttered mind of a child to see the hero as a ""hero"".  He has no social complications in his character; he has no 'hang-ups""---he doesn't drink, doesn't a troubled love life, doesn't neglect his family or his job for his ""hero-izing"", none of that.  He simply does what he does because there's a bad guy out there devising villainous schemes against decent human beings, who's got all the help he needs with a seemingly endless number of henchmen to carry them out.  Our guy ""takes action""; he doesn't prosletize atop a soap-box justifying his actions.  The what, where, when, and how is his motivating force.  The ""why"", with its endless possibilities,nw takes too much time to think about so it never enters his mind.
  If you down shift your mental gears a bit and suspend the harsh demands of""sophisticated"" reality The Drums of Fu Manchu can be the source of some of the  best unfettered joy any movie goer can ever get.  I make a big batch of popcorn, sit myself down in front of my big flat-screen with childish anticipation,  and watch two or three chapters.  It takes the discipline of a Tibetan Monk to not watch the next episode but with practice it gets easier.  After all, you gotta have something to look forward too, right!!!
  Forego that bottle of ""claret"" and spend the money on one of the best ""popcorn"" investments you'll ever make!!",1345420800,2,2103,4.818435754189944
1428568,2,B00005J78F,"ALTHOUGHT THIS SERIAL BOUGHT THOUGH AMAZON HAD LOTS OF ACTION AND MOVED FAST, THE LOW QUALITY OF THE IMAGES DETRACTED FROM THE ENJOYMENT.  USUALLY, VCI PUTS OUT GOOD QUALITY DVDs, BUT APPARENTLY,IT WAS UNABLE TO FIND A GOOD MASTER COPY.",1331424000,5,236,4.9
1428569,5,B00005J78F,"Fu Manchu (played by Henry Brandon), of course, wishes to take over the world, (well, at least Asia), like all mad dictators. To pull this off, he must acquire the fabled scepter of Genghis Kahn, which is in a secret tomb. He is aided in his evil quest by his sinister daughter, Fah Lo Suee, played by Gloria Franklin. Manchu also has a pack of fanged minions on board called ""Dacoits,"" lobotomized zombies of a sort who mindlessly obey Fu Manchu's every command.

The nefarious Fu Manchu is opposed by Sir Nayland Smith (William Royle) and Allen Parker (Robert Kellard). The never-ending action runs the face of the planet from the United States to Asia. The actual filming location was the Ray Corrigan Ranch at Simi Valley, California. All the sets and locations in this serial work are nostalgically terrific.

Republic studios put together a fine black-and-white serial here in 15 chapters. It was filmed in 1940 and runs a total of 269 minutes, presented on 2 nicely-packaged discs. The quality of the print is very good.

You can garner quite a lot from the title of each segment -- here they are:

1. Fu Manchu Strikes

2. The Monster

3. Ransom in the Sky

4. The Pendulum of Doom

5. The House of Terror

6. Death Dials a Number

7. Vengeance of the Si Fan

8. Danger Trail

9. The Crystal of Death

10. Drums of Doom

11. The Tomb of Genghis Kahn

12. Fire of Vengeance

13. The Devil's Tatoo

14. Satan's Surgeon

15. Revolt

There is also a menu pull-up photo gallery with cast biographies as well as a commentary by Richard Valley.

This series never lacks for action, mostly due to its serial format. These episodes were shown along with feature films in theaters back in the 40s to get patrons to return to see what would happen next, ergo, the term ""Cliffhanger"". ""The Drums of Fu Manchu"" was directed by William Witney and John English. The film is based upon stories by Sax Rohmer.

Highly recommended for fans of older black-and-white action-adventures!",1213833600,3,1973,4.628242074927954
1428570,5,B00005J78F,"Fu Manchu is perhaps the best of the Yellow Peril villains in all literature.  Sax Rohmer's series of novels about Fu are quite literate and exciting, if somewhat dismaying in their portrayal of Orientals as evil.  But that was the style of the time, from about the start of the 20th century to 1950.

And this serial, while it does not follow any particular Rohmer novel, is true to the books in almost every detail.  Nearly all the Rohmer novels were set in London, but this serial is set in California and then in some vague Asian country.  Fu is there in all his glory.  As I recall, Rohmer described him as tall, thin, with that famous mustache and long fingernails.  The movie left out only the fingernails--but no matter.

Fu Manchu had an endless supply of dacoits.  By definition, dacoits are Burmese soldiers, but in the serial they are bald Orientals (rather, Caucasians made up to be vaguely Oriental) and apparently are lobotomized.  They all have scars on their heads that would seem to indicate the surgeon's work.  In any event, dacoits do Fu Manchu's bidding without question, often attacking Sir Nayland and his friends without much success.  The lobotomies must have taken a lot out of their fighting and stabbing abilities.

Fu Manchu has plenty of devious tricks to kill his foes, but none of the tricks work very well.  His office in California has a trap door in front of Fu Manchu's desk, and below it is a basement full of water, with a giant octopus swimming around down there.  He has another room equipped with a razor sharp pendulum, right out of Poe's wicked tale.  This is but a sampling of the tricks.  The octopus gets shot and killed, by the way, and we never know who had to dispose of the carcase or how.

The main plot is rather simple.  If Fu Manchu can locate the tomb of Ghengis Khan, he can get a sceptre that will allow him to rule all of Asia.  Exactly how this would come to be is never fully explained--or I missed it.  Nayland Smith et al. must stop him.  The acting is about what you should expect from a serial with that plot.  There are some great chases in old cars and lots of narrow escapes.  But it is the nostalgia that makes this work, and it does work, especially if the viewer is a fan of the Sax Rhomer novels.  Read those first and the serial will mean more.  But look out for the tumbling dacoits.  A good many get killed, but they keep coming and coming.",1187568000,4,2415,4.4419134396355355
1428571,3,B00005J78F,"The serial is a better than average product of the great Republic Studios.  Unfortunately, the transfer is pretty bad, with just barely acceptable image and sound quality.  Perhaps, as another reviewer stated, there is no longer an original negative or interpositive for this serial, and what we're seeing is the best that could be obtained.  Nevertheless, it's pretty hard to watch on a technical basis and for that reason, I recommend a rental rather than a purchase, unless the price comes down to $10 or less.",1160956800,4,513,4.941860465116279
1428572,5,B00005J78F,"One of the best of all time, if not the very best.  It's certainly an all-time favorite of serial fans.  Great cliffhangers, intelligent resolutions.  Right up there with ""Spy Smasher,"" my own personal favorite.

Fu Manchu, a creation of the great British mystery writer Sax Rohmer, became one of the all-time great villains in print and in the movies.  He is played here by the young Henry Brandon (""Secret Agent X-9,"" 1937).  Born in Germany, Brandon had become well known for his part as the bad guy Silas Barnaby (billed as Harry Kleinbach) in Laurel & Hardy's ""Babes in Toyland.""  He made 105 movies, including four serials.

My only complaint is the weak ending, but they had an excuse.  Republic obviously intended to produce a sequel, but World War Two intervened.  The American government was anxious not to offend China by portraying the Chinese in a bad light, so they ""convinced"" Republic not to do another ""yellow menace"" portrayal, and there was never a sequel.",1136505600,5,975,4.8545454545454545
1428573,4,B00005J78F,"Sax Rohmer (1883-1859) was among the most popular novelists of the early 20th Century.  He was particularly well known for his creation of the character Fu Manchu--a truly diabolical Chinese scientist who, along with his equally evil daughter Fa Lo See, sought world domination through the most vicious means possible. In the process, Rohmer virtually created the idea of ""the yellow peril"" in the American and European mind, and his distinctly racist characterizations would color Western concepts of the far East for half a century.

Rohmer's Fu Manchu has reached the screen on several occasions, perhaps most notably in an unexpectedly sadistic 1932 THE MASK OF FU MANCHU, starring Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy.  The 1940 serial was directed by Republic Studio's reliable team of John English and William Witney, and at the time it was felt to propel the genre to a new height; in hindsight, however, it seems fairly obvious that English and Witney's SPY SMASHER and THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL are really the high water mark of Republic serials.  Whatever the case, the directing team does indeed give this tale considerable style and drive.

The story is very linear: Fu Manchu (Henry Brandon) is aided by lethal daughter Fah-Lo-Suee (Gloria Franklin) and a host of mind-controlled henchmen in an effort to secure the scepter of Ghengis Kahn--and thereby fulfill an ancient prophecy that will cause all of Asia to rise up under his leadership and get rid of those wretched Anglo-Saxon types for once and all.  Needless to say, the Anglo-Saxons, both English and American, take an extremely dim view of the whole thing and set out to thwart his evil designs.

The serial starts out extremely well, with a host of imaginative visuals bolstered by a host of equally imaginative tortures.  Unfortunately, Henry Brandon's Fu Manchu proves considerably more interesting than any of the good guys who oppose him, and in consequence the whole thing looses steam long about the fifth chapter and doesn't really regain it until the final third.  But Brandon's memorable performance, the often remarkable visual designs, and the impressive fight choreography does make it entertaining throughout--even if you do wind up rooting for Fu Manchu instead of Sir Dennis Naylund Smith (William Royle) and his incredibly tiresome friend Allan Parker (Robert Kellard), who are supposed to be the heroes of the piece.

The whole thing, of course, is just as racist as it can be, and the final chapter is appallingly so.  But even though it may cause you to roll your eyes it remains a fun sort of thing for hardcore serial fans, who will likely enjoy it quite a bit.  As for the DVD--the film has been remastered, but the picture is rather fuzzy and the sound occasionally muddy as well.  The package contains a brief but entertaining and enlightening documentary (described as a commentary) by Richard Valley and a handful of cast biographies for good measure.
