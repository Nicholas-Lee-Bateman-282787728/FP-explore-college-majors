1570923,1,B00005JPXY,What a waste of time.  The only thing you will get from this movie is a headache.  Tell your friends.  Tell your family; this movie sucks.  The monster is ridiculous and unbelievable.  The humans are annoying and I found myself rooting for their demise pretty early on in the movie.  And the camera shaking for 80 minutes will leave you with a mild case of dementia.,1200614400,11,366,4.46969696969697
1570924,1,B00005JPXY,"I just saw the movie. I donot like this movie. The camera angels where bad. It was not anywhere near as good as Godzilla. Not much action just a lot of running and seeing threw the eyes of the camera. You did not see the monster destroy buildings. You did see a little bit of the monster now and than. I think this movie was made to see just how bad a movie can be made. If I could give a negitive in the stars I would. If the movie was shown buy the Army or Monster point of view it would have been a lot better. Poor writing, Poor Camera angels. One long boring Movie. Save your money and get a real action dvd. Like anything else.",1200614400,19,633,3.953125
1570925,5,B00005JPXY,"That would have been a good name for this movie, echoing perhaps the most quotable line of dialog from the film.  But to be honest, it wouldn't have mattered what the title was -- you could call it ""Milk and Cereal"" and it would have still been an awesome move.

Based on the trailers, I expected a more mature attempt at Blair Witch filmmaking, with something of a sci-fi suspense twist.  In a way, I was right, but also in a way I was completely wrong.

This movie is like nothing you have ever seen before.  It defies all genres.  I walked out of the theater amid a sea of voices muttering things like ""wow. what did we just watch?""  This is film history.  In a time when everything coming from Hollywood is just a rehash of something else Hollywood gave us years ago, Cloverfield is the birth of something truly unique.

The true genius of the film is in its synergy of iconic elements from the history of handheld video cameras, as well as a few what-ifs, imagining how something might have looked if it had been seen by a camera.  It's Blair Witch meets America's Funniest Home Videos, meets Godzilla, meets 9/11 documentary, meets the Zapruder film, meets Titanic, meets King Kong.

Basically, it's like everything you've ever seen before, yet this film is like nothing you have ever seen before.",1200614400,2,1303,4.549356223175966
1570926,5,B00005JPXY,"first of all, i wouldn't suggest anyone watch the movie solely to find out what the creature is and how it operates. that's not what this movie is about. the story is about a group of people who try to escape a city that is under attack. **SPOILER ALERT** while you do see the creature, up close and personal, you basically are a member of the DOD who is watching the video left by one of the partygoers. **END OF SPOILER** This movie is not a horror movie, per se, but an exercise in terror. you are meant to feel what it is like trying to get out of the city, and darn whatever that thing is that the military is shooting.",1200528000,,624,4.122950819672131
1570927,5,B00005JPXY,"There was so much hype surrounding cloverfield that I expected to walk out of the theater with a resounding 'meh'. But lo and behold, I had to think to breathe at the end of the movie. This movie really is a theater experience. This is why they make movie theaters. It was sold out at a 12am showing which hardly happens. I heard some people complaining about some shots being similar to 9/11. If that bothers you don't go. But, grow up and have a reality check. It's a monster movie. Possibly the best monster movie I've ever seen.",1200528000,,532,4.383838383838384
1570928,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is so unique it's so hard to describe.  It is mainly an action movie, but its artistic because it's filmed like the ""Blair Witch"" in first person camcorder-style.  Mix in a bit of a Godzilla movie with some demonology ie, Cthulu, from H.P. Lovecraft, and some serious sound effects from tanks, bombs, screams, and choppers and you can't turn away.  Any one who likes Sci-fi, or religious movies like Hellboy will like this movie.  The camera seems to move too much in a few instances, and some unbelieveably foolish choices by the main charecter made me want to smack him, but they add to the suspense.  Lastly, the movie was less than 90 minutes, a disappointment.  The ending just sneaks up on you, leaving you wanting so much more, and wanting answers.  A must see,,, not only for the hype around it, but for being a HD-Classic monster movie.",1200355200,,857,4.673333333333333

1571272,1,B00005JPXY,"I was hoping to like it, but I simply could not stand the characters.  The director wanted me to believe a 350' monster is destroying Manhattan?  OK.  That there is a lot of danger?  OK.  That Ralph would risk his life to go back and try to rescue Beth?  Really?  That in finding Beth, many hours after, impaled on a rebar rod but still alive?  Not really?  That suddenly, Beth has as much strength to escape as the rest of the small group?  You got to be kidding me.  And being shown in a hand held camera format became annoying real quick.  Perhaps best aimed at an under 20 audience.  It didn't grab me, except to want to grab the remote and stop the movie.  The extras on the disc did fill in some of the details, and in some ways more interesting than the movie.",1522281600,,767,4.164383561643835

1571519,2,B00005JPXY,"At its core, this is a somewhat interesting story, but beyond that the characters are completely two dimensional - lacking any depth or judgement, and the cinematography is bad - OMG I mean epically bad; think Blare Witch Project as filmed by your ten year old brother using a flip phone.  The predominant feeling is not excitement or interest but simple visual frustration.  As for the characters - what can I say, I ended up rooting for the monsters.

1571521,1,B00005JPXY,"This movie was supposed to be what happens in an alien invasion as told by someone with a hand held camera.  It was very hard to watch with all the jumping around.of the camera.  The cast was not very good at all.  At one point they rescued a girl pinned by a rebar in her chest and then she somehow  recovered and was able to use both arms and not bleed anymore.  The plot was poor and the constant , ""oh no"" and other exclamations were annoying.  All in all a waste of my $3.99 to rent it.",1518566400,,491,3.9591836734693877

1571524,2,B00005JPXY,"I can't believe I spent $3.99 for this. The ONLY reason I watched it is because The Cloverfield Paradox on Netflix sounds a lot more interesting but I wanted to see this first in case the Netflix movie makes reference to the events in this movie. Normally I hate the herky-jerky handheld camera type movies. I spent two hours feeling violently nauseated while watching The Blair Witch Project in the theater. It's not so bad on a TV screen but it will never be my favorite kind of movie, especially when the ENTIRE movie is filmed that way. I have no sympathy when people make stupid decisions, like going back for someone who is almost certainly dead (and she should have been with that rebar piercing her chest like that). But what's a horror/action movie without people making stupid decisions, right?",1518220800,,804,4.709219858156028
1571615,2,B00005JPXY,"Well, it is unique, and has some appealing performances. But as far as plot, to call it ""thin"" would be generous. I got bored watching the characters run around dodging chaos. It does pick up a bit in the final 20 minutes, and there are some poetic moments at the end, but I nearly quit on it before then. The shaky cam made me queasy, and the ""found footage"" conceit seemed pretty implausible -- it took me out of the moment, repeatedly thinking, ""Are you kidding me? Why is he still lugging that camera around???""",1518134400,,515,4.431578947368421
1571616,4,B00005JPXY,"To be fair allllllll of them would be safe, except for the brother, if that idiot hadn't just gone and left his other stupid friend the body count for his mistake, was 4 the dude, the friend, the best friend, and the best friend's crush. And why cant the bombs penetrate the monster? Even if they say he has tough skin they the US and most countries have bunker buster bombs in order to penetrate concrete reinforced bunkers no need for that small shit and not to mention that they have armor piercing amo or the basic use of flame based weapons for the flee like creatures instead, and the scene with the tank getting crushed felt like it would be more logical if it was like a human stepping on a Lego because I know that its supposed to be a large animal but not all of its weight was supported on that one foot or hand, so............. Yea sorry just the stuff that made me think that this was just stupid choices and weird ways to portray real life",1518048000,3,953,4.2707182320441985
1571617,5,B00005JPXY,Amazing movie. It's not every day you see a giant monster movie come out that features a found-footage filming style. It's my favorite movie from 2008! It filled me with excitement and thrill. I totally recommend it!,1518048000,,216,4.864864864864865
1571618,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is a cult classic at this point - perhaps even more than a cult classic, since JJ Abrams has so much reach. It came out when Lost was still more or less good, and got tons of buzz back in '08. But the overbearing shaky cam style is not for everyone. I showed it to my wife yesterday and she actually got motion sickness (my first couple of viewings ended in bad headaches). it's unique, it pushes the envelope, but I still think it served to the ultimate detraction of the movie.

What is it beyond a shaky cam movie? It's one of the grittiest, most immersive disaster movies set in a Manhattan so real you can smell it. There is no overt plot, but that's fine, since it tells a very compelling story of the twentysomethings which you come to know over the course of the film. There is a great balance of horror, adventure and spectacle. It's worth overcoming the visual discomfort (perhaps take some Dramamine?) to take in the depth and quality of this movie.",1517788800,,972,4.430167597765363

1571621,3,B00005JPXY,"This review is based on the 4K UltraHD release. Movie was viewed on a 4K OLED with Oppo UDP-203 UltraHD Player.

The movie itself is enjoyable. Not a great movie, but a fun one in the ""giant monster loose in the city"" category. I've previously had the DVD and Blu-Ray releases of this.

The 4K Release is an improvement.. but a minimal one. The movie itself was shot in 1080p using consumer (or ""pro-sumer"") level cameras to give it that home-movie type of look. Don't expect a sharpness/clarity/detail update over the standard 1080p disc. What you will get, however, is the added benefit of HDR.

The disc is indeed in 4K, but it was upscaled from the 1080p source. The minor upgrade in detail is from the upscaling of the source materials.

Audio-wise, it's much the same. No Atmos track, instead it carries over what I assume is the same track from the Blu-Ray (Dolby 5.1)

Extras-wise: Again, nothing new. Same as the Blu-Ray release.

The only real benefit here is the HDR. Even if you don't own the DVD or Blu-Ray, it's hard to recommend this release. It is the best-looking release of the movie, but by a very very minimal amount. Considering the high cost of the title, I'd say stick with the Blu-Ray until this pops up in the bargain bin.",1517011200,5,1247,4.544642857142857
1571622,3,B00005JPXY,"Worth renting maybe once, but I didn't see anything really new here. The Blair Witch school of film making meets Keith Laumer short story concept from 1961 (""Doorstep"", available on Project Gutenberg) with a few Ray Bradbury dinosaur parasites thrown in. Combine this with the main plot of every escape/rescue thriller ever made, like ""The Towering Inferno"" or ""Poseidon Adventure"". None of these things is bad in-and-of itself. I liked Blair Witch, I like Keith Laumer, and I like Ray Bradbury. But the combination here just isn't gripping me. The twist ending of the Laumer story would have improved it 100%.",1516838400,,610,5.0495049504950495

1571938,5,B00005JPXY,"Perspective from the street-level as a towering, rampaging monster plows straight through the heart of Manhattan. At the time this was released, we were roughly a decade past The Blair Witch Project, long enough for the found footage trope to have thoroughly played itself out. Yet in many ways this feels like a revelation, one which would collapse without that same central gimmick. Like bystander footage from a major disaster, the placement of the camera makes the chaos and mayhem of this sudden, citywide catastrophe feel completely vivid and tangible. It's like we're there with the victims; our pulse racing, our eyes widened by the dead and injured, our skin coated by the dust of so much collapsed concrete. Moments that would've certainly felt cheesy from a traditional POV, high above the action, now deliver beyond any reasonable expectation. We get to know the core characters well, their thoughts and quirks and feelings, and we mourn when they're abruptly taken from us in the confusion. It tells a desperate human story in a genre that usually struggles with such elements, and doesn't shy from the profound, lasting conclusion that everything seems to be building toward from the start. The plot does have holes, some larger than others, but given the frenetic pace and rapid developments, those are relatively easy to shake off and leave behind. I was surprised by how Cloverfield moved me today, nine years after the fact. Surely one of the most memorable, ambitious, effective films of the decade.",1507593600,,1518,5.051792828685259

The film does a really great job of conveying what it would feel like to witness an event first hand and see

but the only people we see developed much of are the two lead actors, who halfway throught the movie, I forgot were the leading characters because the new narrator was far more effective as a camera man. As such he's no doubt the most interesting character in the film as he spends the most time with us the audience. Experiencing his struggle while also seeing that of the actual lead of this film. The headlining actor himself does a brilliant job of displaying the sheer torture he's experiencing

There is a particular gravity defying scene that's a bit weird, it's really strange because it messes with your perspective and sense of weight the movie has prior, but other than that, I loved how it was filmed, even if it was a tad blinding at times.

I think the movie would have been better if we had more time to get invested with the core group of characters and their relationships, at best we only get a hint as to why they're the leads of the film. Or why we should care about their survival.

After finishing  I wanted to know more about hte people who actually survived from the group, so the movie does a good job of bringing the viewer in for more.",1498953600,,1459,4.401486988847584

Additionally, there hadn't been one focusing on a giant monster before. Really, this was the movie that made me a J.J. Abrams fan, and although it is not without its flaws or detractors (similar to the only other first person horror I ever liked, The Blair Witch Project. Which also had a huge hype machine building it up prior to its release), I think Cloverfield succeeds as a fun, first person romp with a captivating monster.

But as I said, the movie is flawed. The obvious first person gimmick not withstanding, the movies cast is likeable, but ultimately forgettable. I know them by clich&eacute;s and tropes they qualify as. But I'd be damned if I could actually name any of them. Also, for something that is billed as a horror film, it's not particularly scary or unnerving, save for a few bits and pieces. In fact, it's a fairly tame movie, all things considered.

The choice to use this format might have added a kind of gritty reality and even a bit of spook reminiscent to the Blair Witch Project (now THAT was effective!), but in the end, limited the storytelling too much.  It ended too abruptly and left too many questions for my satisfaction.  What was the monster?  From where did it come?  Did someone make it?  Was it alien?  Was it a biological weapon unleashed by an earthly enemy?  Is someone controlling it?  What were the little monsters?  Were they children?  Or were they just another type of monster?  Why did the bite make people explode?  Did we kill it?  Damage it?  Did we even win the battle, let alone the war against it?  Too many questions, not enough answers.  Also, too much wasted time on shots that swirled around at nothing.  We get it.  It's someone's video camera and the guy is waving it around in panic- but it is just as irritating as watching someone's home video!  Only we didn't sign up for that- we want a REAL MOVIE!  Other than that, the acting was pretty good and I really enjoyed the monster and the action.  The scare factor was truly fun and the story was good.  It just needed more developing.

I was pretty young when I first heard of the movie and followed the campaigns on its various websites. I was so intrigued by all the mystery and the websites that seemed rather ""creepy"" upon looking through them. One in particular was a japanese ""icee"" website depicting  children approved monster characters. I just really love the path they decided to take with the film's lore.

Now everyone talks about the perspective and how much of a bad decision they believe it to be. I personally would like to see a more theatrical angle BUT there is a reason it was made this way. I believe the film wanted you to feel what it would be like, as a tiny human (you) against a giant alien (or ancient?) creature. I love this. I love that the whole hour has teases of the monster, giving you just enough information to stick around and finally giving you an under belly shot (and inside it's mouth).

1572719,2,B00005JPXY,"I enjoy monster movies enough that a lack of plot, bad acting, and poor dialogue does not really bug me. As long as the monster gets its grand debut, wrecks some people and some sets, and takes front and center of the film, I will be satisfied.

Cloverfield is a monster movie with no plot, flimsy acting, poor dialogue, and no monster to speak of.

The damn thing is onscreen for a total of two minutes. If you blink, you miss it. The story focuses instead on a bunch of lame, airheaded college graduates absorbed in their tiny, irrelevant lives. They run. They hide. They scream. That is the depth of their characters. The monster itself is well-designed, lovingly crafted, deeply considered, and left out of 95% of the action. It is be like giving you a two second screening of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre: wholly unsatisfying. Unlike the Louvre, Cloverfield may also give you motion sickness. It says the film is directed by Matt Reeves, but it was masterminded by J.J. Abrams, and his greasy fingerprints are all over the negatives. The film copies hallmarks of successful monster films - Jaws, Godzilla, and so on - without understanding why the original material worked so well. It is the only trick in Abrams' book: market well and use visual flair to cover up a lack of substance.

The use of a camera phone to film this garbage was even shakier.  Think of viewing someone's 1950s 8 mm home movie of their vacation to Yosemite National Park and you get the picture of what I am describing.  I could only view five minutes of the movie before hitting the exit button.  How in the world could the director film the movie from the point of view of a handheld camera phone think it would work is beyond me.  The director must've thought it would be 'very artsy' or a novelty that would gain some kind of kudos.  How could the producers let him get away with this concept?  Did they not view the raw footage from a day's shooting?

Now JJ abrams has done a fantastic job getting close with other movies, but honestly this one is just better, you can buy into the story because the slow dreadful beginning makes sense, and even at the end if you catch a small glimpse of the right side of the screen at the watch beep, it explains how the alien, yes alien, got there. So There really are no loose ends with this movie, PLUS you get to go back to an era before smartphones where nokia banners and posters are everywhere in the movie, which is exactly how life was circa 2007.

The monster is scary, the things it do are scary, and the way the government handles the situation is fairly realistic, as well as the initial coverage by the media, and the reaction of the people on the street. I find the acting is really good for a first person movie.  And although this definitely isn't the best of that genre it does add to the immersion of the horror experience with the situations found in the movie.

1573455,2,B00005JPXY,"I love monster movies. The old time kaiju movies from Japan and pretty much any other country. This was the first American attempt at one in quite some time. Particularly an attempt with real studio backing and an 'on-the-rise' director. The trailers were amazing! Seeing the head of the Statue of Liberty come flying down onto the road? Amazing! Who cares if you didn't see the monster. The set-up was extraordinary! I couldn't wait to see the movie (actually I could since I waited until it came out on DVD but I did get it the first day it was on sale). But then I watched it and the magic was broken.

Now, don't get me wrong, the monsters were cool. I particularly liked the ""bugs"" in the tunnels. Almost.

If this were shot as a regular movie I would have rated it much higher. Heck, if they had just used stabilized cameras I would have loved it. But they didn't. Instead they went the 'found-footage' route. I know some people did not like The Blair Witch Project because the cameras were too shaky. Well, around nine years later Cloverfield came along and increased the camera shake to the N-th degree. I guess it was an attempt to instill authenticity. For me it created a growing sensation of nausea and a building migraine from hell. I even re-watched it a few years later to see if it had perhaps grown on me or gotten better with age. Nope. The authentic unsteady camera remained medically debilitating.

So I guess if you are capable of watching a movie where the cameras seem to be operated by someone in the midst of a grand-mal epileptic seizure then you'll be fine and you can appreciate the movie as it was meant to be. But, if you are someone who is incapable of witnessing an epileptic seizure without becoming ill yourself then you should stay far away from this one. Its a shame.",1484956800,,1803,4.490853658536586

1573542,3,B00005JPXY,"I am not a big fan of the first-person genre. Too many scary movies have tried and failed to implement this method, and, in my opinion, it is a rather cheap and lazy approach to filming. However, I felt Cloverfield put the method to good use simply because I always imagined what it would be like to watch Godzilla and other similar Kaiju-fighting movies from a first-person action perspective. It provided a good realistic perspective of the monster and the action from the ground for certain revealing instances of the movie, and I commend J.J. Abrams and the crew for accomplishing that feat.

The method was way overused, though. Only so many movies can be experienced entirely in first-person. Most good movies can only stray briefly into the first-person realm. Being John Malkovich, while completely different in scope to Cloverfield, had a perfect balance to the filmography as Craig Schwartz used the portal to view John's everday life. The filming fit in neccessarily with the story, so obviously I can't speak too much against the decision to use first-person action in Cloverfield as a story element. However, too many movies like The Blair Witch Project, The Last Exorcism, and Paranormal Activity abused the style. Like the aforementioned movies, Cloverfield lacked a great deal simply because it was literally confined to one perspective.

Cloverfield was a decent movie in general, but it really could have been so much more, especially with J.J. Abrams as a producer. If the writers had spent more time elaborating the story and the shooting, I would think Cloverfield could have reached 5 star material.",1484438400,7,1621,5.044776119402985

1573921,2,B00005JPXY,"This feels like half of a movie: there are relationships, and there is some running around, but it doesn't really feel complete. There are some elements that are simply implausible; for example, even though there is only one big creature, apparently the US military feels that leveling all of Manhattan will hurt it more than just concentrating firepower directly against it. (And we never learn if there is any plan to get rid of all of the little creatures.) It's almost as if the movie's creators knew that they had to explain some of the military strategy but recognized that it was implausible that the main characters would have access to that information, so they just went halfway and gave us a semi-coherent military plan. Another strange fact is that apparently when people get bitten by the little creatures, they explode, which is a fine concept but seems to require some sort of explanation. The movie makes absolutely no attempt to explain certain other elements, such as Marlena's decision to accompany the other characters, whom she barely knows, directly into danger. The movie starts with an attempt to get us interested in the characters (mostly focusing on their romantic interests), which is only partially successful. For example, it is entirely baffling why Hud is interested in Marlena, since we only see her acting surly and uninterested. Then comes the running around part, which is decently directed, if you can stand the camera shakiness. Then the movie just sort of ends, with only some story lines (such as the main boyfriend-girlfriend relationship) resolved in any sort of satisfying way. I was semi-bored and semi-entertained for two hours, and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to forget about this movie pretty quickly.",1483401600,,1751,5.041379310344827

1574505,5,B00005JPXY,"I don't need to say much about Cloverfield that hasn't already been said. This is a review for the super amazing awesome Steelbook.

If 'Cloverfield' the movie was an actual assembled U.S. Government film reel we saw in theaters, then this Steelbook would be the container that houses that film reel. It looks like a metal military container that has been damaged because of the attack on New York. There are faux scratches and bends, with the embossing helping to sell the damage. This is probably one of the few Steelbooks where the more damage there is to it, the more realistic it looks.

Please note, this is a DVD-sized case, so it's slightly taller than the blue Blu-ray cases. It has the same thickness as other Steelbooks.

This is a beautiful Steelbook for collectors and an authentic artifact that could've come straight out of the Cloverfield. Recommended.",1481155200,,868,4.851351351351352

It's a decent movie and one of the better examples of the ""found video footage"" genre of thrillers. I would give the movie a better review, but it has plenty of groan-inducing moments. Like most Hollywood horror movies these days there's plenty of moments when characters do very stupid, very illogical things simply to force the plot in a certain direction. Or they force in some emotionally hysterical arguments and confrontations in an attempt to add more tension to a scene, but end up making the scene feel like something out of a trashy reality TV show.

1575328,2,B00005JPXY,"The premise of the movie, a monster movie taken entirely from the first person, has so much potential because it has never been successfully done before and it contributes greatly to the suspense of the movie.  Unfortunately Cloverfield fails to deliver on a truly suspenseful movie because of its; completely unlikeable protagonists, a very slow start, poor acting, and most of all, slowing down the movie at least 5 times for prolonged scenes of boring dialogue.  Thankfully we have the ability to fast forward past these scenes as to see what good things the movie has to offer.  despite the directors attempts of slowing down the movie with boring dialogue, he does have several suspenseful and otherwise entertaining scenes in the movie which are made possible from the incredible CGI and first person perspective.  The movie would have been much better if they didn't attempt to build background stories for the protagonists and pursue the main characters objective (which I will not say in the review) and instead focus completely on escaping NYC while constantly running into the monster and other hazards.  The monster is pretty cool and relatively original in design.

I'm into the type of movies where it's filmed from one of the characters themselves by cameras, and that's exactly what this movie is instead of an actual movie where the camera tapes all the characters and the actions.

I personally don't like the way it is shot, from an amateuristic videomaker perspective. The first five minutes on that mode was ok, but then I started looking forward to when it was going to end. Well, it didn't. The whole movie is shot like that.

The plot is weak. Oh, wait a minute. What plot? There is really no ""good story"" there. Basically there was a goodbye party going on when suddenly monsters start destroying Manhattan and an heroic guy going through all that nonsense to save a girl. All that is documented in real time by a hand held camera being used by an annoying guy. That pretty much sums it up.

The monsters. What the heck was that? Aliens? Did they come from the water? From the sky? If you are curious and want to know (like I was), do not watch the movie because the answer is not there either.

But they tried so hard to show that the guy didn't have a clue how to film that that was additional torture the audience needn't have been subjected to. Having filmed excursions/events hand-held, I speak from experience. The guy was relentlessly clueless.
As were the characters. A few reviews have said how they related to the characters -- I found them brain-dead 20-somethings who didn't seem to have any experience outside of a very limited social scope or reality, involved w/themselves and the next relationship, no matter how shallow. As such, it was hard to get involved in their experiences from the beginning, and then, as one critic points out, the guy goes into the electronics store to find a battery and people of color are ripping the store off -- another brain-dead cliche, as if your life is worth less than that new TV you've been drooling over in the window display -- while a battle is raging outside. So the director seems cut of the same cloth.
So from an interest stand point, between the characters being/acting brain-dead/narcissistic/shallow/ or shell-shocked, it lacked a bit of pull.
I think losing the hand-held, while still being in the room w/the characters would be a step up, so we see what they see, not what some camera being flailed about sees. And then, of course, creating characters w/a bit more depth to them would up the empathy level a huge amount.

1576319,1,B00005JPXY,"The biggest problem with ""Cloverfield"" is that it is a found footage movie.  Everyone tries to make found footage movies because they think the gimmick is oh-so-clever, but in point of fact they all fall apart over two main problems:

1 -- the WHY ARE YOU FILMING THIS? problem:
In order to be able to follow the dramatic structure of the story, people in found footage stories film things that no human being would ever bother filming, instead of just putting the stupid camera down while they go from point A to point B.  (Seriously, would you bother filming yourself going downstairs alone and getting a glass of orange juice out of the fridge?  You would if you were in a found footage movie!)

2 -- the WHO IS FILMING THIS? problem:
Footage inevitably gets into the film that could not conceivably have been filmed by anyone in the story (yes, Im looking at you Chronicle).

There aren't too many examples of #2 in ""Cloverfield"" but there is way too much of #1 throughout.  That alone is not the biggest problem with the movie however.  The biggest problem is that the characters come across as a bunch of whiny high school jerks who at the beginning of the film are all in a tizzy over who has done it with who.  By the time the catastrophic events finally distract them from their juvenile social problems, you genuinely don't care whether they survive the night or not.

The film gets even more laughable as it goes on.  It turns out an alien monster is attacking New York, which is fine, but at one point during the attack, the Statue of Libertys head lands in the middle of the street near where the main characters are (of course, how convenient), but due to problems of scale, the head (which in real life it is possible for people to fit inside) looks like it could comfortably fit inside a small bedroom or a one-car garage.

For a while you cant see the alien monster very clearly, but then near the end the characters filming the story coincidentally happen to get right beneath it during broad daylight and the creature bends down to look right at them for a clear shot (again, how convenient).  According to the behind-the-scenes material about the film, the whole point was to create an American monster franchise that we can call our own (like Japan has Godzilla), but that approach is made moot by the fact that King Kong is already famously associated with New York.  Unfortunately the alien monster in ""Cloverfield"" turns out to be just another alien monster, and in fact a rather bland one considering the pantheon of alien monsters in cinema history it can be compared to.

There is a thematic sequel to ""Cloverfield"" called ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" which is a brilliant film and which (thankfully) has little connection to this movie.  I would recommend NOT watching ""Cloverfield"" at all, but watch ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" instead.",1475280000,,2852,4.6626746506986025

1576428,3,B00005JPXY,"Rob's friends are throwing him a farewell party in Manhattan. They are all late 20s/early 30s types. Rob's ex-girlfriend Beth shows up but things don't go well. She leaves after some curt words are exchanged. As Rob's best friend and his brother talk to him about it out on the balcony, the building shakes precariously. Turns out Rob should have left New York earlier because some monster is attacking the city. Rob decides to go after Beth. The only problem is she lives in the direction where the monster is attacking.

The movie is a ""found footage"" film. In this case, the footage is a tape from Rob's camera documenting the farewell party, which turns into a chronicle of their experience of the attack. The tape has some old video when Rob took Beth to Coney Island the month before, giving the characters a little more background and empathy. Unfortunately, it looks like there are some edits (like most of the testimonials from the party?) that blow the attempt at realism and immediacy. I never got fully invested in the film like I did with Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity. I started wondering if the Coney Island bits, which made sense narratively, would really be so perfectly lined up in random spots on the tape. So the found footage was a problem for me.

The other problem I had was all the hints at what's really going on. I had the impression that there was a larger, more interesting story and we were stuck following this group of semi-interesting, semi-sympathetic characters. The ultimate ending for Rob and Beth is touching if not surprising. I was expecting more from the talent behind the film (produced by J. J. Abrams and written by Drew Goddard). Some moments are startling and beautiful and terrifying but quite a bit of the film looks like stuff borrowed from other, better films.

I was surprised by how mediocre this film is. It would have been less distracting without the found footage gimmick and a better story was probably going on somewhere else in Manhattan. The isn't bad; I am still going to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane, which hopefully is the better story.",1474848000,,2108,4.73841961852861

Characters enter an abandoned building and are surprised that the elevators are not working. Maybe they should have read the sign that states that when there is a fire DON'T USE THE ELEVATORS!! I guess they didn't know the elevators return to the first floor. I just want to know where I can get the battery that powered that video camera. I wouldn't have to charge my phone for days.

That was the goal... and they succeeded.
I just watched this... LOVED IT!
I live in Manhattan, so get readily upset when Hollywood screws up the logic & easily checked day-to-day geography facts of NYC. This was spot on. Every step of the way. They re-created as close to a real NY, NY, as they could on a soundstage. Kudos to the Tech & Design personnel on this movie. ONE glitch (for the sales / product placement office): NYC does NOT put ads on the outer tunnel walls in subway stations -- even the older, quirky stations. They'd be on the walls on the platforms somewhere... A minor quibble, but annoying. Otherwise, spot on...
1st consensus complaint issue: the ""hand-held camera"" approach. To all those bothered by it -- GO WATCH ANOTHER MOVIE!
The shaky, unnerving, claustrophobic environment that approach creates WAS THE WHOLE POINT, FOOL!!!
9/11 came at us out of nowhere. The Chelsea bombings this weekend came at us out of nowhere. The Boston Marathon bombing, the Great Johnstown Flood for pete's sake. All chaotic & out of nowhere to those running for their lives from... WHAT?? At that moment, you know Nothing. There are No Answers. Everyone is asking Everyone Else. The world around you becomes chaos, people make plenty of logical-but-realllllly bad decisions they pay for later and nothing remains familiar. THAT is the unnerving goal of the camera effect here -- shot by skilled cinematographers, NOT the cast. Every jerk of the camera was highly planned & carried out, not happenstance.
Did I find it bothersome. unnerving & scary? Of course. But then I was SUPPOSED TO...! That WAS THE POINT! I finally adjusted to it. Nobody ever promised you a Rose Garden. Go find another flick if you want to be spoon fed.
Hadn't realized that the Time Warner towers at Columbus Circle were that old. 2007... Thought they were newer. Just getting old, I guess...
My wife just informed me that we'd seen it before. I had echoes of ""maybe --"" but I remembered not one bit of specifics. So, like the really good Tokyo monster movies, this may be one of those you can happily see 20 times & have it be fresh every time... Good scary, happily vapid fun!
Kudos to all concerned...",1474329600,2,2221,4.741602067183463
1576849,2,B00005JPXY,Movie was very slow to start and the shaky camera got old after about 3 minutes. The plot was boring and the ending was very abrupt and left me wondering why i wasted my time. This movie left a lot to be desired.,1474329600,,212,3.953488372093023
1576850,2,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is the on-land version of Open Water, a relentlessly depressing movie about a couple of scuba divers who get eaten by sharks. Here, a group of friends, attempting to flee for their lives after an attack on NYC by a very large critter and its skittering, crab-like offspring, get killed off, one by one, until every one of them is dead. The entire episode is recorded by one of the friends carrying a video camera with an unbelievable amount of film in it. I mean, this determined fellow hangs onto that camera like a cephalopod and keeps filming, hour after hour (in movie time), as buildings crash, while fending off crab attacks and creeping across teetering girders, as rockets blare and bombs blast, as giant feet come down from the sky, and people die violently around him. He never, ever runs out of film or, indeed, lets go of that camera until he's...you know, dead. The dialogue consists mainly of people moaning ""Oh my god, oh my god!"" and the movie hangs on the thinnest of storylines - one of the friends trying to reach his ex-girlfriend who, despite being skewered by a steel beam, has called him on her cell phone which, despite the destruction of NYC, continues, miraculously, to function. Like NYC in this movie, Cloverfield never goes anywhere but down. It seemed silly and pointless to me.",1474329600,,1320,4.7186147186147185

I know that a lot of people dislike this type of cinematography, however, I believe that in this specific instance, Cloverfield does an amazing job with it. It helps you truly feel like you are almost a part of the movie and what is happening.

Aside from the filming style, overall, it's a very good thriller movie that I still enjoy watching every now and again. And for all of you who hate that there are so many unanswered questions, that's all part of the appeal. By having filmed it in POV you experience, see, and understand all of the same things that the main characters do. It leaves a lot open to your own imagination to try and figure out what YOU think is happening, where it came from, why its happening, et cetera.

Most people want a movie that tells them exactly how to think and feel about the events, and leave them 'fulfilled' in that they understand everything that occurred. If you're that person, then this movie is not for you. If you want to be able to take this movie to the next level and come up with your own thoughts and theories about what happened, and even what may happen, then this should be right up your alley.",1473811200,,1321,4.387755102040816

Found it to be a cool little Indie monster movie that is much better in all respects than any of the big-budget Godzilla movies made by H-Wood. Had low expectations going in given some of the reviews, but these expactations were adjusted significantly upward mere minutes into the film. Movie has some comic relief courtesy of one character. Just shows what you can do with a small budget, big imagination, and a talented (unknown) cast. Thought the SFX were quite good as well.

People are distracted by the camera effect and therefore don't appreciate the thrill that's behind it. I don't even notice it, so I get to enjoy the story, the character development, the excitement and...the creature. The creature design is phenomenal. I don't have the right superlatives to describe how tickled I am by that thing. The few glimpses you get of it are just enough to keep you intrigued while at the same time maintain the mystery of what it is exactly. There is a backstory to the movie and a little research online will fill that in. There's even a website with additional videos that reveal this is the result of a greedy company, not the government, who dug a little too deep (no pun intended). It's an aquatic creature. The things falling from it are parasites.  And...it's a baby. That little tidbit alone is enough to get my mind going. The information is sparse, but that's the way it should be. Unlike most movies that wrap things up in a little bow and do all your thinking for you, this is fairly open ended in both the beginning and end. It's up to your imagination (oh my god imagination) to fill in the rest. I've watched this movie several times and each time I am just as thrilled when the creature comes onscreen, especially at the end when you get to really take in some of the details of it.",1472774400,6,1469,4.440740740740741

So I gave it a try and wasn't disappointed.  Which isn't difficult when you go into it with exactly zero expectations.  I never saw The Blair Witch Project, so this was my first experience of a personal-video-disaster scenario.  It was surprisingly compelling and I actually really enjoyed it.  Was it the best movie ever made?  Of course not.  But it wasn't nearly as bad as a whole host of other disaster and monster movies out there.  I think part of the reason for that is exactly what so many reviewers had an issue with: there was no closure, there was no super-cheesy dialogue, there was no over-explanation of the plot and motives of the monster.  It was just suspense and action, and I really think that the first-person video does a great job of pulling the viewer into the action, at least in this movie.  Not everything that happened was entirely believable...but seriously, if you're able to suspend disbelief enough to accept a monster terrorizing Manhattan, then accepting people traipsing from a building into the collapsing one next to it shouldn't be that big a jump.

Bottom line, this was not a thought-provoking, movie-of-the-year type film.  It's just entertainment, and I'm okay with that.",1472342400,,1348,4.8384279475982535

But if never seen, I'd suggest it for most SciFi fans.  Five stars earned, because it delivered -- not that other five star films don't deliver more, but a certain amount that validated the purchase was achieved.  There really should be a ten star rating system here.

4th? time: 5-19-17  I don't regret seeing it again despite knowing it so well.  The CGI still worked, the acting better than the writing, story still got me because the ending leaves me raveled.  Would love a sequel.  Nation needs a sequel, but no hand held cams please.

The found footage is from the people that were involved view, it started out at a party with one of them filming the party but the monster attacked and for whatever reason they felt the need to continue filming. I don't know, if I was involved in that situation, filming everything would not be what I would be worried about, but it's a movie so things happen that don't make sense. There are also parts where the people make questionable decisions, but all movies do that, bad things wouldn't happen if bad decisions weren't made.
For what it is the movie isn't bad, personally I would have preferred it not being found footage as I think I would have enjoyed it more, but I still enjoyed it.

1579643,1,B00005JPXY,"I saw this movie back in theaters when it came out, and was hugely disappointed (I haven't seen a movie in theaters since.)  It's a monster movie that won't focus on the monster, instead preferring to focus on the people.
The people bring very little to the film besides yelling and screaming at each other about how incredible all this is, but the camera work prevents the audience from seeing half of it.  I get that shaky cam is considered its own cinematic style, but when 70% of your film is visually impressive destruction, it's a bad style for the film.
The character motivations are the barest of minimums - ""I've gotta save my girlfriend"" for the male lead, ""we've got to go with our idiot male lead"" for the rest, even refusing to be evacuated so they can go after their (possibly dying) friend.  The combined intellect of the film's four main characters could probably get you through high school, but not much further.
In sum: this film is
70% monster destruction, at least half of which is hidden by either shaky camera work or Hud turning the camera back on the people in the scene.
10% pointless yelling.
10% stock characters (extra generic models.)
5% twenty minute intro that just shows everyone being boring while the audience waits for the monster.
5% thirteen minute credit sequence.

However, I loved the ironic ending of the taped-over end of the world documentation compared with the world before the alien attack...nice contrast.  A few of the scenes of New York being destroyed had an eerie similarity to what we saw during 911. T. J.

It gave a few good jump scares even to my spouse, a very jaded lifelong devotee of the horror genre.

I will add that if you stream Amazon to your TV thru a Roku box, the most recent (summer 2016) change in format seems to have nothing but glitches, darn it.

It's tiresome and lazy work by the producers to create shock value by having the age old helpless women that only know how to scream and freeze in terror. I related completely with the main character, Rob, who kept it mostly together and who's part did not entirely consist of alternating moaning and screaming.

They're also unbelievable because no one would keep filming non-stop in the middle of a life and death situation. You need your hands free to protect yourself, and the camera takes away your peripheral vision and your depth perception.

Also, giant-monster movies set after 1970 just don't work because the military would just shoot the monster with a missile, and the movie would be over.

But to me it was worth it to get to know the characters before the action started.

1581576,1,B00005JPXY,"Wow, did this movie suck. First half hour is a group of 20-somethings throwing a going away party for their friend, Rob. Lots of pointless chatter with hints of group dynamics. Beth, Rob's secret love interest, leaves the party and goes home. In comes the monster - which looks like the love child of Alien and a flea. Said monster starts smashing up Manhattan. While trying to escape the area, Rob decides to go back for Beth. Because everyone knows that when a monster the size of King Kong is wrecking the the city, people just hang out in their apartments, right? Actually, Beth really was at her apartment, impaled on a piece of rebar. When Rob & friends, minus a couple of friends, make it to Beths apartment, they pull her off the rebar and the group is off and running. Literally. In case you're interested, the herd got thinned when one died after being bit by the spawn of the alien/flea. Or did that happen after they rescued Beth...? Can't remember. Also can't recall what happened to the other friend. But it doesn't really matter anyway since it wasn't Rob or Beth.
Anyway, Rob, Beth and two other lucky survivors run around for a while and nearly get rescued in a military helicopter. But it crashes. Yet somehow the group survives. By this time I'm thinking to myself that when the alien gets done with Manhattan the only thing that will be left is Rob, his friends and the roaches. But one of the friends had left in a separate helicopter and the remaining friend who had been operating the camera the whole time, gets killed by the alien. Finally, it's just the two brave love birds...who get themselves killed while hanging out under a bridge making a selfie. Which restored my faith in the natural selection process.
If you insist on watching this movie, be prepared for very limited visual themes. Consisting primarily of a group of dumb people hanging out in someone's apartment and running through streets and buildings. The verbal themes were equally limited; excited party chatter followed by Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob! Rob! and Aaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!

The focus in kaiju films is on the monster, the focus in disaster films is on how people deal with the disaster, and this is definitely the latter.

The acting was good, I will say that. Not outstanding, but good. The plot was ok, but again, nothing outrageously unique.

1582633,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is Blair Witch Project done right!

Shot from a first-person perspective (supposedly). Cloverfield follows several twentysomething actors in New York City as the story unfolds.
I'll only include minor spoiler here. The story starts very slow. That's probably my only critique is that it takes a while to get going. You can see that the director was trying to develop characters and do it in such a way that it doesn't feel pushed. It feels like you are following along with one of the characters who just happens to be filming a party and events afterward with a video camera. Bad things begin to happen about 30 minutes into the movie.

Unlike Blair Witch Project, while the motion of the camera is a little herky-jerky, it doesn't make you nauseous and feels pretty natural. I'm thinking a lot of it wasn't actually filmed with a hand camera, as there are some pretty amazing special effects which must've been green screened or added in later to some high-resolution video and then stepped down to look more like something you would take from a consumer level video camera.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Don't go into this looking for brilliant dialogue or insight to the meaning of life. It's just a fun ride with decent special effects and an interesting spin by the director on a first-person perspective movie.",1459209600,2,1332,4.833333333333333

Am I to believe the guy behind the camera makes it through all his trials (running, fighting mutant alien insects, rescuing friends) while still managing to keep the camcorder up to his face? And as a NYC resident, none of the scenes (especially in the subway and street) are remotely realistic in a post-alien-insect attack.

1583069,5,B00005JPXY,"I loved this movie! I bought this to watch before seeing 10 Cloverfield Lane, and honestly didn't know what to expect. I had watched an interview with J.J. Abrams in regard to this film, and he explained that while visiting Tokyo, he and his young son checked out a lot of toy stores that were still filled with Godzilla related toys. He felt that it was amazing to see that even decades later, Godzilla was still relevant to the the culture that created him, and thought it would be so cool if the US had it's own monster.

I always read the critical reviews before I decide to watch any movie, and I took issue with some of the complaints. The first was to the reviewers that believed that there were too many unanswered questions. Okay, so let's be honest, if some mysterious ""alien"" creature just shows up out of the blue, it's not going to be taking the time to explain how it got there. It's just going to be following its instincts like all other non-english speaking creatures. Pshhh. Duh. I mean who knows, maybe it teleported through some crazy wormhole that it stumbled upon on its planet, or the military was experimenting with genetics and the thing got out, or even perhaps it crawled out of a tunnel that was exposed due to a sinkhole opening up in the earth. The point is, how it came to be there doesn't need to be explained, because if this really did happen, you'd be in the same boat as the characters in the film, wondering what the heck is going on. The second was the handheld camera approach, I totally understand why some people couldn't get past that part, but for me it added to the excitement, and at times made me feel closer to action.

Maybe this movie isn't for everyone, but it was definitely a hit for me.
P.S.  To all of the reviewers reading WAY TOO MUCH into the script: ""Hey, sometimes a story is just a story, and a monster is JUST a monster.""",1457568000,98,1882,4.386819484240688
1583070,1,B00005JPXY,"I'm actually shocked at all the good reviews this movie received.  I must be getting old because everything about this movie was annoying from the best friend who was asked to film a going away party to the hand-held camera affect, to the constant excessive screaming, to the main character's decision to risk all of his friend's lives so he can go back and try to save his girlfriend who may or may not be alive in the midst of a giant alien monster attack of Manhattan.  I personally wanted to kill the best friend Hud (Hudson) myself for never shutting up, even during tense moments when everyone was trying to focus on staying alive.  In spite of their life or death situation, Hud just continues filming every little thing they do rather than focus on getting the Hell out of Dodge, or helping his friends.  I guess it's a Millennial generation thing where everything must be caught on camera rather than actually living it and doing the responsible thing.

1583349,4,B00005JPXY,"I'm going get straight to the point. I liked this movie. Sure, its a run of  the mill monster movie running around destroying a city, in this case NYC. But the ""found footage"" style adds an element of realism and point of view it and sets it apart. Seems the biggest complaint is the shaky camerawork. And I admit, I can see why people don't like that aspect. I'm a fan of these kinds of films, and even for me, it can be a little too much at times. But overall, it didn't bother me. As far as the story line goes, I'm going to be honest, I don't really care. The first 15 minutes of the film is used to try to establish relationships between characters..two specifically. And its that relationship that sorta pushes the narrative along. But if you're watching a monster movie expecting some serious character development and dramatic story arcs, then you might want to pick another genre. It's a monster movie. I want to see a monster. I want to see destruction, mayhem, and panic. At least that's the way I feel about it. The acting is pretty average. Nothing amazing, but again, that doesn't really concern me. What surprised me the most were the special effects. They were a lot better than I expected. The creature design is really good as well, and I liked the fact that they didn't just show the monster all at once right from the beginning. The movie make you wait a little while before you get a good look at it. It adds to the shock and scare factor of just not really being able to tell what it is or what it looks like, but you know something big and nasty is out there. There are also some smaller creatures in the film, but I thought these weren't done quite as well. Overall, this a cool, entertaining, and exciting film for me. Watching it for the first time, and getting the first glimpses of the monster was pretty darn awesome. And the camera style really brought the realism to whole situation of being stuck in a hellish disaster area. If you like monster movies and found footage films, this is a dream for you. But if you're not a fan of that style, you may have some trouble enjoying this one.",1453334400,,2117,4.373096446700508

I know it's the age of youtube and phone cameras which means we're all exposed to people who don't the first thing about filming an event or subject properly and effectively. But you don't expect that in Hollywood movies. Why call attention to the camera constantly by using the handheld shaky-cam method for ""realism"" used for the last decade on every edgy cop movie or TV show? Give me a break.

1583639,4,B00005JPXY,"This was an exciting film with an angry monster that will scare the Dickens out of you. It gets off to a slow start but the attractive, capable, likeable young cast keeps things rolling along until the real fun starts when the monster appears, inflicting unending destruction on Manhattan. The Cinma vrit handheld camera technique is very effective and draws the viewer into the action and will definitely elevate your heartbeat. This film has the same limitations as the Godzilla series in that we do not know where the monster came from, why it is here or what it wants, but this monster has more personality than Godzilla, and the film is so visceral and terrifying that viewers will not consider this an issue. I found that some scenes where characters died needed more information for the benefit of the viewer, and the film started to put people at a lower priority in sort of a dismissive, perfunctory sense that made the film sort of shallow or lightweight. I think more intelligent dialog and storytelling would help in this regard, although the film is generally exciting. The hand held ""you are there"" camera technique really adds excitement, although it may give you motion sickness. One limitation with this style is that we only see what the cameraman sees, so this limits the impact of certain scenes. For instance, showing a long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge collapsing would really add some excitement. Nevertheless very involving and watchable.",1432944000,,1461,4.919028340080971
1583640,4,B00005JPXY,"I enjoyed this movie. It was scary and suspenseful. The biggest pluses about this movie were that we, the viewers, never received all the answers and the ending wasn't a happy one. Isn't that life? We die not knowing all of the answers, and not every ending is a happy one.

The con: I found a couple parts of the movie difficult to swallow. Specifically, I had a difficult time believing that Rob's friends would join him on a suicide mission to rescue his injured and immobile ex-girlfriend (sort of) from the 37th floor of a severely damaged and leaning precariously building. It is even more difficult to believe that someone who barely knew him (Marlena) would join him on this mission.

The friends eventually run into a military base of sorts and were told that mandatory evacuations were in effect. Instead of the military guy getting their names, birth dates, and next of kin info, and asking them to sign a form releasing the government of any liability for their poor judgment, he simply gives them the time the last helicopter leaves Manhattan. Also, none of the military guys tried to thoroughly explain to the group what exactly they were facing and how the odds of all of them making it out alive were next to zero. So, Rob and his friends head out on a suicide-rescue mission to midtown Manhattan, towards the giant, scary monster plus many of its small but lethal (and equally scary) offspring. This is right after Marlena dies from The Bite. If that wasn't enough, the military was engaging in an all-out war against the monsters. Either they (including girlfriend on the 37th floor) were going to be killed by the monsters or they were going to end up as collateral damage. I know this was just a movie. I just think it would have been more effective if the characters behaved more like real people. I can see not-thinking-clearly Rob attempting to rescue his trapped girlfriend across town but not his friends, especially not Marlena. Marlena staying with them didn't make sense. I gave the movie 4 stars for this reason.",1432598400,,2041,4.698324022346369

1583644,5,B00005JPXY,"This is one of those movies that starts off very different than what you are expecting. It starts as a love story that has gone awry and a guy in love with a woman who wishes he'd suddenly vaporize, all centered around a farewell party. The hand held camera technique adds to the tension between the two pairs of un requited lovers whose lives are suddenly thrown into a chaotic hell dominated by a creature so hideous it was copied in the latest version of ""Godzilla."" The flying head of the Statue of Liberty, the sky scrapers falling over, brief glimpses of something awful moving around in the background, soldiers advancing down the street firing at the creature, the shell casings from their automatic weapons clinking on the street, fighter aircraft, tanks, cannons, the skin crawling roar of the beast all captured on a camera held by a man who is in utter confused terror. This is one of the best and most engaging scifi/horror flicks I've seen in a long time because the hand held camera engages you with the characters and makes you empathize with the complete and horrifying change that has taken place in their lives that they are coping to understand while they try to survive it.

I'm not kidding. If the word ""dude"" was shouted once in this abomination, it was shouted over 200 times.

Basically, when a gigantic... whatever comes out of nowhere and invades NY for no reason, starts tearing everything apart (again) for no reason, some mouthy, unfunny hipster with a handheld decides to film the entire ordeal while being chased and attacked. That's not all. During the ""plot"" advancement (LOLOLOL) all of the mediocre actors do their best to act like normal, everyday hipsters that are like, TOTALLY, like inconvenienced by this, like, TOTALLY rude monster... like (<--- And yes, every character is scripted like a valley girl). If the shaky camera work (which gets old about 20 minutes into this turd) isn't bad enough, it's the little spawns the main monster shoots off that should have ripped the characters to shreds, yet they survive. Thank God.

They survive long enough to waltz into a military camp where the commander gives them a walking tour and rundown of how bad they're getting their asses kicked, all while Mr. unfunny, mouthy hipster is obviously filming it all. Really? But that's not all. They take a helicopter ride! And crash! And this STILL doesn't kill the untalented cast! And the hipster is STILL filming everything, including one of the whiniest characters who complains about his legs while being dragged from the crashed copter (in movies, only the pilot dies), yet Mr. ""Aw dude-brah mah legs is broked brah"" hits the bricks like Jesse Owens when he sees the main monster is headed their way. Thankfully, the camera goes blank at one point and I'm hopeful that this occurred when the camera hit the monster's digestive tract along with every uninteresting character in this waste of hollyweirdness.

The writing is great because Drew Goddard is talented writer in my opinion. The direction is good and solid with mind-blowning sequences and great editing. Even the special effects are good.

1583778,1,B00005JPXY,"Ouch...this movie redefined terrible.  When it originally came out, we bailed around mid-point.  J.J. Abram's decision to employ the latest state-of-the-art ""Shaky Cam"" left my wife with a migraine and me nauseous.  So, I tried it again on DVD.  Like tuna fish, Cloverfield does not improve with age. The concept is solid, but in almost every other aspect the film falls flat on its face.  We are introduced to a group of self-absorbed twenty-something, cartoon characters who, quite frankly, grew more annoying as the movie progressed.  From the opening bon voyage party for a friend relocating to Japan, to the climax in Central Park I never cared a wit for any of them.  Amazingly, the entire movie is filmed by Hud (T.J. Miller), a self-professed newbie with a video camera, who somehow manages, within the span of less than half an hour, to single-handedly becomes the greatest combat photographer since Robert Capa or Matthew Brady.

While the monster is original and the CGI effects excellent, it isn't enough to rescue the film from the endlessly idiotic decision the main characters make or the wretched visual quality.  For the life of me I cannot understand the military in this film.  It was obvious that this-would-look-cool overruled this-would-be-accurate.  I can't believe Abrams couldn't hire a military adviser for a couple of hours.  Really?  Small arms fire against a creature the size of a 20 story building?  A B2 Stealth bomber? Why? Does the monster have X-Band radar?  Jeez, the monster has been ripping apart Manhattan for hours so collateral damage can't be that much of a concern.  Deploy a squadron of A-10 Thunderbolts.  Their 30mm. depleted uranium shells chew up tank armor like construction paper.  Then when the creature is down, have a C-130 fly over and drop a MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast) the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the USAF arsenal.  The confinement of the blast within the canyon-like streets of New York would have reduced the monster to jelly.  I could go on but what's the point.

1583802,4,B00005JPXY,"I love this movie. Everyone complains that there's no explanation,  backstory, etc. for the creature. This is a handheld camera movie from the perspective of average people in the beginning of an attack. You wouldn't get a backstory and explanation if a monster suddenly appears and attacks the city your in! It's realistic.
That said, the special effects are great (with the exception of the final money shot of the creature) and the atmosphere is perfect. The movie was well executed and I loved the lack of answers and resolution.
My only complaints are it is a little much to have the viewer believe a guy could and would hold a camera to his face through all this almost without pause, and that the old Hollywood go to is followed where the only thing that matters is 1 character wanting to rescue the girl he loves at the expense of his friends and family being put in serious danger to do so. Also (spoiler alert) the aforementioned character has little reaction to his own brothers death but a huge reaction to his best friends death.
I would recommend seeing and owning this movie. Look past the handheld camera movie stereotypes and give it a chance. This is certainly one of, if not the best, movies in that genre.",1420761600,,1225,4.6192660550458715

1583914,5,B00005JPXY,"Abrams, or Reeves, whoever, has completely redeemed movie making. For the last couple of decades, movie making has been plagued with a blight called shakey cam. Directors and producers by the dozens have revealed their utter ignorance about, well, everything, by shooting inane, stupid movies using shakey cam. Sometimes, because deep down inside they know the technique has no tie or connection to what is happening in the movie, but they want to do shakey cam because they're sick, they'll make the excuse that the camera is being hand-held by one of the actors. What these morons don't get, because they are utterly stupid, is that there is an infinite difference between a shot that looks hand-held, and shakey cam. There is an infinite difference between a shot where the motion captures the chaos of a scene, and shakey cam.

Abrams/Reeves totally get it. Totally get it. Here is a movie that is from start to finish in a highly stylized hand-held technique, and it is night and day, completely different from, and other than, shakey cam, because Abrams/Reeves totally get it.  I hope this will be the spike in the heart of shakey cam, and that we will never see another shakey cam movie, ever. Maybe they'll even gather up all the existing shakey cam movies and burn them.

This movie is gripping, captivating. I can't take my eyes off of it. It's not trying to be realistic. We're not supposed to think this is really a guy continuing to shoot a mini cam through the attack of a monster on New York.  It's trying to be a stylization of realistic, and it succeeds brilliantly.  And It's not trying to be another Mothra/Godzilla/King Kong. It's trying to be a stylization of Motha/Godzilla/King Kong, and it succeeds brilliantly.

This movie is fresh and new, intelligent and vibrant. Indeed, it takes everything that is ugly (shakey cam) and cliche (monsters eating the city), stylizes it, and spins it into a new fabric that feels good the moment you put it on, like a new friend you want to be with all the time. This is the long awaited new old days of movie making. Abrams/Reeves have proven that movies don't have to be stupid just because they're made in the 21st century.",1409961600,,2185,4.721784776902887

1583917,5,B00005JPXY,"So clearly I'm a bit out of sync with the average reviewer.  This happens.  I liked Sarah Connor Chronicles, Dollhouse, Cabin in the Woods, Firefly.  These all were either cancelled TV shows or movies that didn't do well.

Call this Blair Witch/Godzilla/Starship Troopers, sort of.

It has some Blair Witch aspects in that it's filmed by supposedly regular people on a handheld camera.  Unlike Blair Witch, where you don't really see much actually happen, there's a lot of stuff blowing up, guns, tanks, aircraft shooting at monsters.

I thought the opening pre-first-explosion bit was slightly too long.  Acting is pretty good, as are effects.  I watched a 2nd time with some fast-forwarding and saw some little details that were actually pretty impressive.  A lot of attention to details went in to thinking out the camera shots, placement of objects, sounds in the background, etc.

I watched some ""making of"" stuff on YouTube and doing so added to my overall respect for the film.",1406678400,,984,4.975460122699387

It is boring and takes too long.  We had actually recorded this on DVR before we purchased and missed the first part of the movie up to the sequence right before the first action begins and it didn't detract from the experience at all! The suspense in this movie is fantastic. It is so good that gratuitous violence, cruelty and gore were unnecessary. Those are the fall back techniques for talentless directors and writers.  The monster remains a figure we see fleetingly until the very end, another important point.  No one cares what the creature actually looks like.  Take Jaws for instance.  The shark they created failed miserably, they used it very little and discovered, thats a good thing!! Good actors don't need well-constructed monsters.  They only need to act the part of a well-constructed character.  These actors, writers and their director succeed! This is a classic that we will watch many times.

1583941,3,B00005JPXY,"Caught this shortly after the superb ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" Matt Reeves' (then) most recent offering. For what it was- a 'found footage' film of a monster attack on Manhattan- it's tough to see areas that could be significantly improved; the film was executed with skill and, to a lesser extent than DOTPOTA, restraint. It's tough to really connect with the characters, though, and several scenes whose success depends on this connection fail as a result. I'm ultimately unsated. I was hoping that this would scratch the itch that 2014's utterly forgettable ""Godzilla"" neglected to scratch, but it looks like I'll need yet another monster to do the trick.",1405728000,,666,4.955357142857143

1583945,1,B00005JPXY,"This movie tried to be Blair Witch Project meet Godzilla and wound up being Killer Clowns from Outer space meets Gigli.

My main complaint about this movie is that they spend less time creating a background for the monster (what is it? Where did it come from?  Why is it so ticked off at NY?) and more time trying to develop a love story between the main character and some girl he has known for a long time and apparently finally got in bed right before the monster attack.  For half the movie he is walking across NY with 3 of his friends to get to her and save her (while the monster is tearing up the city) and the other half of the movie he is walking back with the girl to a supposed safe spot where they will be evacuated to safety.  In between all of that they sprinkle in some monster scenes.

The monster itself looks like a 300 ft. version of the alien from Signs and it has these 3 ft spiders attached to it that jump off and randomly kill people (kind of like Alien - except no incubation).  It also apparently has the resilience of Godzilla because it seems impervious to bombs and missiles.  I would have been much happier if they left out the first 20 minutes of the movie where the secret love affair between the main character and the girl is revealed, explored, analyzed, and discussed for 2 minutes of understanding the relationship between the spider things and the 300 ft. monster.

Note to directors:  It would work just as well if you left out the first 20 minutes and just had the main guy say ""OMG, The love of my life is trapped across town and I must get to her.""

How did the Statue of Liberty lose it head you might wonder?  I would write spoiler alert if I actually knew what happened to its head, but sadly I do not.  The head came flying through the city right at the beginning of the monster attack and that was it.  Again, I would have much preferred to see what happened rather than waste two minutes watching the camera guy try to hit on a girl like some 16 year-old virgin at a singles bar.  Did the monster punch the head off?  Did the monster bite it off?  Why did he even attack Lady Liberty??  That's what this movie was like every step of the way -no cohesion, no rhyme, no reason.

And the worst part.  About one third of the movie was filmed with a camcorder.  Why??? Was it supposed to add authenticity?  The guy doing the filming was given a camcorder to film the main character's friends at his going away party.  Then all of a sudden he channeled his inner Cecil B. DeMille and wouldnt put the damn thing down - not while running from the monster, not while being attacked by the spider things, and not while crawling through rubble.  And where exactly did they buy this camcorder that it can record for 12 hours straight on the same tape??

1583974,3,B00005JPXY,"'Cloverfield's' primary appeal is the novelty of an entire movie being shot as if by a hand-held videocam, which adds viscerally to the realism. This however is not enough to carry the story, as thin as it is. Admittedly, the technical constraints of shooting from one point-of-view preclude having too much complexity, but a little more depth is needed to give the characters material to respond to.

After an attack by aliens the characters make an attempted flight to safety. This drags in places. They traverse three landscapes: street-level, a subway tunnel, and a hi-rise building. The plot-points (inciting incident, turning points, and climax) lack strength because the story hinges entirely on: 1) an attempted flight from the mayhem, and 2) a rescue.

Many adventure and disaster movies have a plot even less developed than this. What this movie needs is more backstory, more interaction between the characters before and after the hysteria, and more incidents for the characters to respond to. Plus it needs a theme to fuel the turning points.

I got the feeling this was a film school movie idea that they took to the big screen, with mixed results. Overall, though, this was a groundbreaking experiment in simulated 'cinema verite' filmmaking.",1400284800,,1256,5.117073170731707

The special effects were marginal and you only see the ""creature"" for about four seconds at the end of the movie.  I gave this movie a second star because the guy carrying the hand held camera at the end of the movie gets wasted by the ""creature"" (the only good part of the movie).

Cloverfield is a movie about a a giant alien who lands in NYC's harbor and attacks the city. It is almost as gargantuan as the task that I'm currently undertaking of writing reviews but causes much less emotional damage.

It's a well done film with a fairly original take on things and the acting ranges from passable to not too horrible.

1584110,4,B00005JPXY,"The 2008 science-fiction thriller Cloverfield was written by Drew Goddard, produced by J.J. Abrams, and directed by Matt Reeves.  The film boasts one of the greatest hypes of all time; a teaser trailer was released during the previews to the summer-2007 movie Transformers, the title remained unknown until the second teaser which appeared before the fall-2007 movie Beowulf.  This is definitely one of those movies that keeps the heart racing.  I highly recommend adding it to your collection because, to really put the little and important nuances into perspective, you may have to watch several times.

BACKGROUND:  Despite the online viral marketing, the actual plot for Cloverfield was well hidden.  Various websites popped up to preempt the films release, but the only sanctioned sites were 1-18-08.com (which touted still-shots from the movie conveying panic and frenzy, yet kept fans guessing as to what might be the cause of such terror) and [...] (which provided a sneak-peak to an annihilated Manhattan as well as a clip of the monsters roar).  To protect the screenplay, actors were auditioned with scripts not intended for use in the movie itselfthe selected cast had no idea what they were getting into.  During production, the film was given several codename titles to conceal the identity of Cloverfield.

Abrams credits his inspiration for the movie to a trip he took with his son to a Japanese toy store; he said he wanted to create an American counterpart to King Kong and Godzilla.  While filming, the Cloverfield Monster had not yet been incorporated, so the actors had to pretend they were scared of something else.  The monsters final design is attributed to artist Neville Page; the creatures rampage is caused by separation anxiety:  it is a young monsterling trying to cope with loneliness and an unfamiliar environment.

One of the most noticeable things about Cloverfield is its cinma vrit style, meaning that it is shot to look as if one of the characters is recording each of the scenes through a handheld camcorder.  While the cinematography accomplished an authentic feel, many were upset with the shaky-camera look, complaining that it gives a feeling of motion sickness.

STARRING ROLES include:  Michael Stahl-David as Rob Hawkins, Odette Yustman as Beth MacIntyre, T.J. Miller as Hudson Hud Platt, Lizzy Caplan as Marlena Diamond, Jessica Lucas as Lily Ford, Mike Vogel as Jason Hawkins, Ben Feldman as Travis, and Billy Brown as Staff Sergeant Price.

SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Defense is examining Robs camcorder of personal footage from the events from Cloverfield; most of the recording is time-stamped from 5-22-09, but because the camera was damaged, cuts from previous recordings appear throughout the movie.  A cut from 4-27-09 shows that Rob has slept with his good friend Beth.  On 5-22-09, Hud begins recording the going-away party (thrown by Lily and Jason) for Rob, who is moving to Japan.  Since their hookup, Rob and Beth have experienced a falling-out; Beth brings a date to the party which leads to an expression of animosity from Rob.  After Beth leaves the party, Manhattan experiences what feels like an earthquake.  They initially believe the flickering power is due to a capsized oil tanker that collided with Liberty Island.  All beliefs are suspended when they see that the head of the Statue of Liberty has been propelled into the streets of Manhattan; Hud catches his first glimpse of the monster.

The Army National Guard has been deployed to combat the smaller menaces that appear to bud from the main monster.  A massive evacuation of Manhattan across the Brooklyn Bridge ends in turmoil when the monster tail-whips the bridge into smithereens.  Rob gets a voicemail from Beth saying that she trapped in her apartment; Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena venture to Midtown to free Beth.  While traveling through the subway tunnels, Marlena is bitten by one of the budded monsters.  The group reaches an army triage where they are warned of their closing timeline for saving Beth and the last chance to escape on an evacuation helicopter; once the last helicopter departs, Hammer Down Protocol will annihilate Manhattan.

Once they free Beth, the group high-tails it to the evacuation site.  When their helicopter takes off, the first bomb is dropped on the monster.  Irritated, the monster swipes their helicopter from the sky.  Rob and Beth survive the crash and take shelter in Central Parks Greyshot Arch.  The two use their final moments before the air raid to confess their love and leave testimonials on the camera  [Not spoiling the ending, but pay attention to the final cut on 4-27-09, specifically the ocean in the distant background.]",1382918400,,4719,5.084415584415584
1584111,3,B00005JPXY,"This was quite an unusual approach to a movie.  The whole concept of the movie was based on the fact that there was always someone video taping everything, and the viewer sees everything in realtime through the lens of the video camera.",1382486400,,236,4.619047619047619

Apparently some guy thought it would be ""artsy"" or "" realistic"" to strap a camera to his head and get a bunch of jerky out-of-focus shots of loud violence. After about ten minutes of looking at these cinematic convulsions I was starting to get seasick so I stopped watching and just listened while I did something else. What I heard was a lot of ""Oh my God!"" and ""We can't go there!"" unrelated to any discernible plot. I kept it on anyway until it was over, thinking that no one with any self respect could make a mess like this without putting at least something worth watching into it. I was wrong. This movie didn't even end--it just stopped. I got this CD in a boxed set that contained ""Cloverfield"" and ""Dark City."" Here's my suggestion: open the box, take out ""Cloverfield,"" and use it for a coaster. Then watch ""Dark City"" and be amazed.",1382400000,8,868,4.465408805031447

So much so that I had to type this review right after it.  Cloverfield needs a good home or movie theatre environment to bring out the full experience.",1381190400,,441,4.2023809523809526
1584114,4,B00005JPXY,"If you just sit back and let this movie happen to you, it might just be a thrilling experience. Putting the viewer behind the movie camera is an instant ""in"" for the movie audience, causing intimacy and involvement. I feel like I just spent 80 minutes stumbling through Manhattan with a handful of other people, while a mammoth creature was destroying the city. And since it was all make-believe, I'm relieved that it's over and that I'm alive and well.

You need to enter into the 'found footage' monster movie ""Cloverfield"" knowing that one or more of the characters might make stupid and rash decisions. When Rob finds himself and his buddies in the midst of a colossal disaster during a party, his first and only thought is of Beth, his love, whom he needs to find. Without this noble quest, we might not have such a gripping film. And it is gripping, and engaging. Once the thrills begin, it's just a fun ride .... harrowing, sure, but a real dose of escapism that makes for a good night at the movies. J.J. Abrams (who was involved in ""Lost"", ""Super 8"", the latest ""Star Trek"" movies, and more) wanted to give America something similar to Godzilla, and this is definitely effective.

Steer clear of this flick if the shaky, handheld camera movies like ""The Blair Witch Project"" make you queasy. ""Cloverfield"" will have the same effect, particularly when our intrepid heroes have to ascend a building's staircase to its roof and then cross over to the next apartment building that is leaning against it.",1380931200,,1508,4.708333333333333

This is filmed entirely on a camcorder (or is made to look like it), which adds to the horror effect.  It begins at a wedding party, so you get a good feel of normality, of the lives of the main characters, but then something attacks the city.  It isn't clear what, as you only know what the characters experience.

Imagine a tragedy happening that destroys New York.  A terrorist attack on the entire city (instead of just two buildings), a hurricane that leaves the city in crumbles, something the rest of the country is watching on the news in shock.  What would it be like to find a camcorder afterwards, somewhere in the destroyed city, that shows what was going on as it was happening?  A whole two hours or so of video as it was occurring?

That is Cloverfield.  There's no soundtrack, no music in the background.  This is nothing but what you would see as you were watching a video taken on the scene.  It's not at all like other horror movies, and as such, is definitely worth watching.",1380931200,2,1155,4.336448598130841

I was expecting more destruction and feedback from what was happening in outside sources, tv and radio.  There is a little input, but the action focuses on 3 people.  I frankly was lost as to who they were and who they were looking for.  As for pace in this movie,  I get better pacing in the paranormal activity movies.  This movie is like the first time I learned to drive a clutch with rapid action scenes followed by slow talking scenes.  The previous(flashback) footage on the tape does not help the movie after the initial scenes.  I understand the need to establish the relationship with the woman that are after, but there such a thing as too much.
Final Verdict:  The title is as vague as this movie's plot and the monster doses not give a payoff.

Yes, it is about these 5 young people who have to survive in Manhattan after a very BIG monster invades the city. Godzilla comes to mind, without the trademark screech. But in Cloverfield the monster comes suddenly out of nowhere and it is hellbent on destroying buildings, so about the only thing the 5 main characters have to do is scream, run, shout, cry, scream, run run run, scream, cry, and argue about which direction to take next. That is what passes off as ACTING in this sorry movie. Thus, there is no real PLOT. The actors just scream and run. Where did the beast come from? They don't say. What does it want? They don't say. What's the plan? They don't say. Heck, the actors are so bland and unidimensional that we really don't care if all of them DIE in the movie!  The ONE saving grace is that the special effects are good. This movie would have been better if it had been about a mindless monster destroying empty buildings in Manhattan---without ANY PEOPLE (with no acting talent). That would have been more palatable. Don't waste you money on this bomb. Watch Godzilla vs Mothra---it'll be more fun. Moral of watching this movie: special effects alone cannot save this sorry dog.",1377129600,4,1356,4.580246913580247

It puts the viewer in the situation in such a way that you only know what the characters know. So even though it doesn't tie things up with a neat bow or have the ""well you see Timmy"" moment; it does make the viewing experience feel genuine. After all, how many times have we watched a major event unfold on the news and really known what was going on? The media doesn't even get the story right at first. Now place yourself in the situation, all you hear is an explosion, then people screaming and running away. That is what this movie is like.",1372464000,,646,4.30327868852459

I live in NYC and watching its decimation made me cringe more than any (tastefully handled) bloodshed.

On a wide screen, the shaky-cam photography WILL get you a bit seasick, but it's a fun watch.

There is, however, a major arc that had me screaming, ""then let him go, darn it! That's HIS thing, not YOURS!""

What I found interesting was the genuine fear the characters filming the ""creature"" had presented.
Filming the movie in this way (""documentary style"") saved the writers from having to explain what exactly the creature is, where it came from, what it wants, etc. and therefore just was able to write a movie of endless chaos.
No explanations, no ending, just there.
With the same filming style along the lines of ""The Blair Witch Project"", this one falls short to Blair Witch.  At least we learn the story of the Blair Witch. In Cloverfield, we are left in the dark on what the heck is going on.

1584205,1,B00005JPXY,"I was wondering why I hadn't seen this movie yet...and now I'm wondering why I did.  It is not good.  In order for this type of movie to work, there needs to be some level of buy-in from the viewer.  I'm not talking about suspension of disbelief -- a monster taking over Manhattan is pretty hard to believe.  But the storyline needs to be solid enough for the viewer to WANT to believe.  I just saw ridiculousness everywhere.  First there are the holes regarding the presence of the video camera that supposedly provided the content of the film.  For some reason, one of the main characters, Rob, had it in his possession during an impromptu one night stand with his best gal pal, Beth, at her apartment. (He used it to film their next day together, not their night, so don't get any ideas.)  I got the impression that he worked in finance or something of that ilk, as he was being transferred to Japan, and was not a documentarian.  About six weeks later, Rob's brother, Jason and Jason's girlfriend, Lily, have this same camera, which belongs to Rob, in their possession to film Rob's going away party.  Rob's best friend, Hud, ends up with those duties and captures the group's night-long efforts to save each other from/escape the inexplicable monster that is desroying the city.  There is no reason for Hud, who is also not a documentarian, not to have dropped the camera during the mayhem other than to give this movie a reason for being.  Apparently the writers noticed this problem because it was explained away by Hud stating that filming the events was a good distraction from them, or something like that.  In addition to the camera's bizarre ubiquitousness, I was surprised by its exceptional performance and fortitude during the night's trials and tribulations; it survives as a prize possession as everyone is getting mauled.  Also, and this might be nit-picky, but given the level of damage to the city, the power outage that occurs probably wouldn't have been so brief, except an actual power outage would have posed cinematic problems.  In addition, Rob receives a well-signaled cell phone call in the subway while the U.S. military is grappling with the chaos the monster is causing above ground even though circuits were previously jammed; this is quite fortuitous (getting a text message through maybe -- but a full-fledged phone call underground under these circumstances???).  Lily is adept at walking literally miles of subway track in high heels which she finally takes off when she has to climb multiple flights of stairs; at this point she would've have two sprained ankles.  I don't want to delve too deeply into the story and ruin it for those who do want to watch, so to sum things up, in my opinion, the ""Godzilla"" movies are more realistic.  I'm sure ""Cloverfield"" fans can explain away all of the things that I interpreted as ridiculous, but the fact is, I found them to be distracting.  Granted, they might be more distracting for those of us who are familiar with the lay of the land in NYC.  If you really enjoy the ""found footage"" trope to the point where you can forgive a thin and flawed storyline, then this movie might work for you.  It didn't for me.  And I'm a huge fan of the horror genre so it's not like I need things to be realistic -- I do need them to pull me in as opposed to keeping me at arm's length, noticing how silly they are.",1368921600,3,3381,4.6375838926174495
1584206,5,B00005JPXY,"I'm suprised this movie only got 3 stars overall.  Really great idea for a ""found footage"" type film.  Special effects are great and pretty realistic. Pays homage to Godzilla and other Kaiju films.  I especially like the Bluray version, the special features are great, especially the U.S. Department of Defense ""analysis video"" of the movie.  Looks pretty official even though it's fiction.  I think this might possibly be the most expensive ""found footage"" film out there at the moment.

1584207,5,B00005JPXY,"I am surprised at the majority of negative reviews this film recieved considering the fact that the film contains some of the most remarkable special effects ever captured on film. The effects are so good that it is astounding just how realistic they really are. It is far easier to capture convincing special effects on film than it is in high resolution video formats like the ones used for this movie. It looks like New York city is literally being destroyed by a gigantic bizzare creature that towers over New York's tallest buildings. The destruction of massive buildings and surrounding areas appears so realistic that it looks just as real as the footage we have all seen of the twin towers being destroyed. This alone is an amazing accomplishment. What is not so convicning is the fact that what we see as the audience is presumed to be captured by a single person on a single video camera. That is pretty rediculous to say the least. In such catastrophic conditions I would think that camera would have been abandoned long before it is in this film. And it does borrow it's premise shamelessly from 'The Blair witch project', but it is done so well that I didn't feel the need to complain. The acting was also excellent by the enitre cast.

1584210,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverield is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the film, but there are problems that I had and that others might have with the film. Cloverfield is another attempt by America to do our own original monster movie. This time they used the found footage format to make it their own. Comaped to other American monster movies, I'd say that this is my favorite. Though, as I said the film has problems.

One complaint I have is the found footage format. I like that they tried a different appraoch to making a monster movie, but it did not work for me. The camera was too shaky and did not focus on a shot long enough for the viewer to completely take in what was happening. Though I could buy it in the beginning, as the film went on, I found it hard to believe that they would not drop the camera.

Another problem is the characters. I did not find them annoying, but I thought they were bland. I did not find one of them interesting. So when they died, I did not care.

The effects were good. I thought that the design of the monster was cool and looked very original. There was a ton of hype surrounding this film when the teaser first came out. People were wondering what this thing was that was destoying New York City. So some were probably let down by the fact that it was a monster. I did not get into the hype so I was okay with it. This film also had a great atmosphere to it as well.

Overall, I did enjoy this film. However, it is not for everyone.",1366848000,,1445,4.168458781362007
1584211,5,B00005JPXY,"Don't think I have seen this approach since Robert Montgomery starred in (and, I believe, Directed) Lady in the Lake filmed as it would have looked through the eyes of his character, the Detective. Substitute a home movie camera and you have Cloverfield, something like 60 years later. I was taken by the Montgomery film (as I was by almost everything that pioneer star of the talkies did) and am quite taken with this one  (despite the absence of any  presence playing in the same league that he did). For the most part, I  think the cast did very well, playing people who were not supposed to be actors, and the filming, as if from a hand held camera, made for very effective viewing.
The set-up is simple: a going-away party is being given one of the young (20 something) crowd, on the eve of his departure for Japan for a new job. One of his friends is suckered into being the cameraman, taking statements from attendees on film to be given the man of the hour for future watching. Midway through the party, Manhattan Island (NYc) is attacked by never clearly seen monsters. The remainder of the film is devoted to responses to the attack and attempts to get all the friends to safety.
There is little phoney heroics. There are some unlikely actions but,  on the whole, the gimmick works and I was quite pleased with the results. I can recommend it to fans of action and disaster thrillers.",1366588800,,1394,4.54183266932271

On July 4, 2007 I remember seeing this teaser trailer right before Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" film.  Like the other people sitting around me in the audience, I was wondering why there wasn't a title to the movie.  My first impression was that it looked like ""Cloverfield"" (as it later was revealed) would be Dead On Arrival in terms of a good movie.

The movie involves a group of young actors (who simply can't act) dodging explosions, a giant hideous monster with parasites terrorizing New York City, filmed the entire time with a hand held camera.  It has no back story, no character development and no satisfying conclusion.  Let's be honest people, you CANNOT make a good movie with hand held cameras (not even just one camera for that matter), unforgettable characters and absurd dialog!

Not even talented actors (Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, etc.)  could save this movie much less make it more entertaining.  ""Cloverfield"" is an abomination (like the raging monster) and is simply unwatchable.",1362441600,4,1135,4.99468085106383

* The battery lasted at least 12 hours (it was a party at the start and daylight at the end) of constant taping with no problem.
* This camera can survive numerous attacks by mean things, take boulders collapsing and never gets scratched!
* This camera is so important that the yuppies don't dare part with it.

And yet, with all the advanced power of the camera it doesn't have video stabilization!!

Beyond the remarkable camera, there are the characters.  Rob is really, really stupid deciding that he can dodge a giant monster to find his girlfriend.  The women characters just scream and bleed.  The dude holding the camera is well...just there to hold the camera.

The reality is this is a really bad movie.  The blair-witch camera ruins the film because you spend the entire time wondering why these idiots would continue hold and record while their city is being stepped on.",1361664000,4,1116,4.676923076923077

Most of the dialogue is screaming, OMG!  The Army had an almost immediate response to the event.  They seem to have arrived en mass about five minutes after the scary spidery thing appears.  Shades of 9/11 with buildings crashing down.  It seems you can have an injury serious enough to bleed to death, but once extracated you can run several city blocks.  This wasn't bad film-making it was the worst movie I may ever have seen in my 61 years!  Too much unbelievable feats, too much reliance on main characters (apparently after these five can not escape the city, they are all alone--we know now how fast and efficiently you can evacuate NYC); why bother paying for extras to make it more realistic?

How would things go down if you and your friends were hanging out one night and the world around you completely fell apart?  Not from a birds eye, flashy Hollywood view, but the camera is on YOUR shoulder.

I loved that it felt so real in how people reacted to events so outside of their scope of reality.  You experience them going through the stages of terror, mental shut down and then clinging to their sanity by grasping onto a goal that made sense in a world that had become unbelieveable.

It engaged me by walking us with the characters step by small step through chaos.  Get out of the city- devastation at that attempt.  Then living from one meter to the next- hide behind car, next objective: make it across the street, next objective: go down those stairs...  it was so real- as real as a monster atacking a city can be- that's what's crazy about it.

I'm a fan of JJ Abrams and heard he had some involvement with this.  In true Abrams form we don't really find out what the heck is going on, but figured that going in.  This is from the perspective of a character with a video camera obsession, hence some blair witch style camera movement, be aware of that in case that motion makes you queasy.  This is a monster movie of course, but the monsters themselves aren't so much the focus as the experience of the group of friends in the situation, so don't expect super awesome transformers or aliens level graphics or scenes.  You WILL need to keep a solid suspension of disbelief going since the monsters aren't explained, and also because the people are able to survive some rather extraordinary physical traumas.  Most of the poignant scenes are things you'll have seen from other movies or read in scenes in books, which is probably why people were disappointed initially.  All in all it was entertaining enough, I don't regret watching it, and when you have your expectations set properly going in it's not as disappointing as some reviews suggest, the initial marketing just hyped it far too much when it was initially released.",1359331200,,1480,4.709302325581396

This film brings the godzilla-type movie right up to the present, and with it, an amazing sense of real danger.  That being said... We now must address the negative aspects...First and foremost is the annoying person who accompanies us through the entire movie. His name is Hud and he seems to never shut up. I really can't describe how obnoxious this character is, except to say - he makes the other shallow & annoying characters seem interesting and likeable in contrast,and truly, that is quite a task - because they all come off as spoiled high-schoolers instead of ""sophisticated"" New Yorkers.(p.s.-what's up with the girls all wearing the babydoll style dresses? & what stupid company in Japan is hiring an american who's barely drinking age as a vice president?)  Anyway, it's too bad they didn't all get squashed in the first 5 minutes and a homeless wino didn't pick up the camera and take it from there.

1584393,5,B00005JPXY,"J.J. Abrams was inspired to create the story of Cloverfield while visiting Japan, and witnessing the fervent love that the culture had for its national monster, Godzilla. In that regard, I feel that he has succeeded, which is why I am rating this movie five stars. The Clover monster is an awe-inspiring, rampaging beastie that lays waste to NYC with grand aplomb, and is of such size and stature that it could have been ripped straight from the Cluthu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft. I loved the monster's design (a touch of which can be seen in the creature from ""Super 8"", another Abrams creation), and the way that it was sparingly revealed, one brief glimpse at a time (with CGI done right, mind you). But rather than copping out and leaving the monster's true form to the audience's imagination, Cloverfield swings for the fences, delivering a full reveal in the film's finale. In my opinion, this reveal was a success, which was difficult to achieve, given all the (extraordinarily well done hype) that preceded this movie's arrival. Those who are curious as to the monster's origins can scour the found footage (and internet) for clues, which is a great touch.

I feel that the major complaint with Cloverfield is that the characters are too annoying to empathize with. While this is certainly true, I don't think that Abrams ever intended for us to empathize with them... we're supposed to empathize with the monster, who is lost and scared, and simply lashing out in this new environment full of things that seek to hurt him. Just like in the tradition of the Godzilla movies, the monster is the true ""hero"", not the people!",1352246400,,1628,4.773049645390071

Ok, I know, people are getting tired of the mockumentry hand shaken, but not stirred films, but I can't resist a giant monster movie, especially one as good as this!

A giant monster with deadly offspring attacks New York City. We don't know where it came from, what it is, other than it can topple over 50 story buildings & is multiplying quickly with fast moving/growing offspring whose bites bring on a deadly infection to whomever is bitten. It is impervious to non-nuclear military attacks, & is wreaking havoc on to the city.

Sounds like your typical Japanese giant monster film, right? Yes, if that was what all this film was about, but it isn't. That's where the handheld POV camera comes in & tells the story of mass hysteria, & the horror of an unknown terror. Of how a group of young New Yorkers try to survive the onslaught of not just the monster, but the military trying to destroy the monster, & a city collapsing around them. It delves into these characters psyches as they confront certain death, time & time again. How they band together for the good of all & the good of one. There is no fairy tale endings here to make the audience feel better. There is no sparing of heart rendering scenes. This is mayhem, wicked, brutal, & heart breaking. This is what it would be like if this scenario was to ever happen. Real people with deep emotions & attachments losing their loved ones & their lives.

""Cloverfield"" is a clever heart pulsing thrill ride. It smartly never lets you get to many good glimpses of the monster. Most of the time a shot of the head, the body, the extremities, which make the beast all the more threatening.

""Cloverfield"" knows how to get your attention! A particularly great scene is one of the head of the Statue of Liberty flying of it's shoulders & landing blocks into the city, rolling to a stop in the middle of a street. A great parable to 9/11. A great parable of pure unadulterated horror of something so incomprehensible happening, that it overwhelms the logical mind. A true demonstration of just how naked & vulnerable we truly are as a species, whether it be against our own kind, or nature.

Yes, ""Cloverfield"" is an allegory to a path that many fear the most & expect the least. A path that has been traveled down time & time again in the real world, but we never would think it would happen to us, until it does.",1352246400,,2401,4.495412844036697

I realize the mistake was reading too much into negative reviews probably by the same people that would give  film like this 1 or 2 stars and a film like Paranormal Activity (that's barely a film btw)5 stars. Cloverfield although a shaky cam movie is the only one I can see having a legit reason to be shaky. The characters are running for their lives most of the time, they are always panicking, they use the camera as a tool like for light, and eventually start using it to document what they see. In this movie it actually makes sense to have a shaky camera and the shots although never clear make sense. This is the first person perspective of someone caught in a monster attack and that's what the movie is about.

 They show just enough of the creature to let you know that you do not want to be near it. The few shots they are seen of the creature explain more than enough about it. It's not like Godzilla 2000 where the creature is some mystery most of the time. It's revealed in a more interesting way. When everyone is running from the creature they barely see it only the damage it does but, once they start going towards the creature they see more of what it is. The plot is pretty foolish though in that it's about a group of friends running back into danger to find 1 girl that may or may not be alive even. The group does foolish things but I didn't find it to be annoying or that silly as people seem to complain about. Why? because all they really do is bring you to the action. Running away from the monster, fighting it, going into buildings, etc. etc. that's really about it. It's not like they're screaming and yelling at each other for 20minutes. They do scream and yell and argue BUT, the difference is it's when they're actually doing something interesting so your not paying so much attention to them as to what it is they are doing.

 This mostly is your typical monster movie but done with a much better and much more film worthy budget that makes it believable. That's pretty much what makes the movie good is that it's believable. Nothing that's too impossible ever really happens, and the worst thing I can think about is when they moved the girl who was impaled (that's usually the worse thing to do but hey, it's a movie and they were in danger). I liked Cloverfield and wish I watched it much sooner. The promoters did good for this show keeping the ""monster"" a secret and just showing clips of the chaos. It kept people guessing about the film and that's an interesting way to market a giant monster movie.

1584452,5,B00005JPXY,"I found Cloverfield to be a VERY disturbing film, almost compelling in its horror (as in ""I can't look away""), and I think it actually is groundbreaking because of what I think they were trying to do.

Although on the surface it may SEEM to be illogical and annoying, a bad effort at making a modern ""Godzilla"" movie, I believe it used a totally new approach to story telling in cinema (and I am NOT talking about that annoying ""first person"", jiggly and wobbily camera stuff).

I believe it was trying to break the mold of the usual ""giant monster eats metropolis"" genre. The approach they used makes it the kind of movie that requires some thought to answer the question: ""WHAT were THEY thinking?""

And, I think I figured it out.

I think that this movie is an attempt to film a nightmare - AS nightmare, using all the elements and techniques that are characteristic of a nightmare. I think it was successful from this point of view. See if some of my observations ring a bell.

The Plot:

There isn't a plot, and if they were going for filming a nightmare, true to the way nightmare's work, then this is completely appropriate.

Have you ever had a dream where you are being chased by a monster? It's terrifying, there's no reason why the monster is there, there is a lot of mayhem going on around you, and you feel terrified and HAVE to run and hide. Only you run to the most illogical places, people around you don't make sense, what they say makes even less sense, and the monster is unbelievably relentless. Stuff of dreams.

I think that's what was going on in this movie. And on this level, it worked for me. I left this film (which I have seen twice) feeling that terrible sense of disturbance that a nightmare creates. So I give the film credit for this, IF that is what they intended. (I may be giving them more credit than is due).

Because this film is nightmare in cinema, logic doesn't have to work. In fact, logic has no place in a nightmare. So it is with this film. To criticize plot issues for illogical elements is unfair. Dreams don't make much sense.

Think of your nightmares, think of this movie, you'll may make the connection.

The Characters and Dialog:

As in a nightmare, these people are dream characters. They have no more substance than a half realized idea - again, the stuff of dreams. Each represents a persistent train of thought, which is what dream characters are designed to do. Rob is persistent in his quest to save his girlfriend. He represents the nobler emotion of heroism. Hud is persistent in making a video of everything that is happening. He represents our need for constant observation. Hud often missed pointing the camera at things we needed to or wanted to see.

How often do WE miss seeing what we need to or want to see?

Other characters represent feelings of being victims, feelings of being helpless, and even hopeless.

Think of the girl who was bitten by a ""parasite monster"" and later explodes! Ever have one of your ideas ""exploded""? Ever have someone jump on you because of an idea you had and they tear it, and your psyche, apart with harsh criticism?

The characters are one dimensional because dream characters are one dimensional. They have nothing of interest to say because, for one thing, given their situation, what could they say? For another, what do your nightmare characters say as the nightmare unfolds?

We have no feelings for the characters because we don't have feelings about feelings, which is what these characters are.

This is a major departure from usual cinema, and it could be considered groundbreaking.

The Monster:

The monster is of course, very much the stuff of nightmares. Big, unrelenting, impossible to understand, unmotivated. Monsters in nightmares represent unresolved emotions or conflicts. They are unresolved because we can't figure them out. They are terrifying for the same reason. The mind always tries to find resolution. When it cannot, it views what is the problem as monstrous.

So the Cloverfield monster comes out of nowhere, for no reason, and like a monster in a nightmare, you cannot defeat it.

That's why everything the military does is of no avail against this monster. Have you ever tried to fight a monster in a nightmare? If you have, you probably know, you can never win. In ""Godzilla"" nothing worked because of his ""atomic shield"" or some other implausible nonsense. In Cloverfield, the monster cannot be defeated because he is an unresolvable situation. Stuff of nightmares.

The Rest of the Film:

Given that this seems to be a nightmare in cinema, it is interesting to consider the techniques used.

Camera Work:

A lot of people complain about the camera work, the shakiness, the uneven photography, and so on. I AGREE, it is extremely annoying. However, it may have been necessary to use this technique in order to maintain the heightened sense of terror. ""Normal"" camera work would have been too ""rational"" to work in this type of approach. Still they could have toned it down a bit. But think of nightmares and dreams. How often do we see things cockeyed in them, from impossible perspectives, much as this camera does in the movie?

Music:

There isn't any. Obviously. Music adds to the story, helps unfold the plot (as when the violins start screeching in more conventional horror films to cue the audience that something bad is about to happen). But in a nightmare, there is no music and no cue. Everything is a surprise, as it is in this movie. So of course, this movie doesn't really have a ""score"". If it did, it could have ruined the nightmare quality.

Sound Effects:

It was interesting how disturbing the sound effects -- which were all normal expected sounds we hear every day -- in this movie were. When Rob and friends are in the collapsed buildings and the safety buzzers are sounding... that is uncomfortably disturbing. Safety buzzers are supposed to be disturbing, of course, and I think they used this as a completely natural occurrence (since the buildings are running on back-up power) to heighten the fear elements. We are conditioned to be on ""Alert"" when one of these devices is sounding. I always jump when my smoke alarm goes off because I burned the toast. Have you had a similar experience? This film used these everyday sounds to heighten the tension. For me, it was appropriately creepy.

Scenery:

New York City, even being destroyed, is still a dramatic stage! I think the film makers made good use of it, the empty subway tunnels, the abandoned buildings, taking what is normal (crowded subways and buildings) and turning them around -- making them mysteriously empty. This also heightened the uneasiness of this movie for me. Which led to...

A Venue Change:

At this point, I think they switched gears for a while from ""nightmare as cinema"" to ""first person shooter game as cinema"". Some of these games are also nightmarish in their design and action. They also have a compelling quality about them.

The characters are alone in different scenes, running through empty corridors, making hairpin turns... all like the protagonist in a computer game, and the stuttering visuals (from Hud, the camera guy) resemble a game player trying to control his or her character with a joystick. And like a video game, we have the ""little"" monsters that pop up out of nowhere and attack. It's scary in video games, it was terrifying in this movie.

Special Effects:

I cannot imagine the huge amount of work it took to make this film. Granted much of it was CGI, and that in itself is a daunting task. The sets (especially the cockeyed building interiors) were obviously well conceived and executed. This was an expensive film to make and the set designers deserve credit for a very fine, and disturbing job - well done.

The Ending - Discovering Ourselves:

The idea of it being a nightmare in cinema film -- something never tried on this level before, I think -- not even ""Blair Witch"" holds a candle to it -- is further supported by the ending of the movie.

The video camera keeps filming after the bridge collapses on the remaining characters and then goes black. Why?

At this point, I realized that the audience is part of the film, just as we are part of our nightmares. WE ARE the camera! Like our ""eyes"" in a nightmare, we see through this device, and it is the one thing that cannot die. Obviously, we usually don't die in our nightmares. When a nightmare becomes too much, it all goes black and we wake up. When this movie became too much (all the characters were dead), it went black and we were left looking at the credits in total silence. Even the silent credits were disturbing and clever. Silence implies respect in many cases, such as at a funeral or in a library. Here, the film was silent, denoting how serious it was, the terror, the fear, the utter hopelessness... welcome to my nightmare, because when we awaken from a nightmare, we are there, in the silent darkness... alone with our fear.

This film brought us to our fear and left us with it, just as a nightmare does.

------------------------------
Overall Rating:

5 stars for a very good, very annoying, very unlikable, very disturbing, very clever, very compelling and very well done movie.

Pros:
Very innovative approach to the ""giant monster"" horror genre.
Look at it as nightmare, release logic and reason, and it may work for you.
Well crafted scenery and sets.
Terrifying.

Cons:
Camera work was too disruptive and jiggly. They could have toned this down.

-----------------------

Conclusion:

If you like nightmares, or are compelled by them, this film may grab you on that level and hold you there. Like nightmares, it is annoying, irritating, disturbing. Look at the film from this perspective and you may appreciate it.

I have to say, it was a very clever approach and it worked for me.

That original way being: not knowing anything about what is going to happen. In the tradition of the creators I will explain without spoiling. Cloverfield is a story of madness and chaos. The insanity unfolds in front of your eyes one fast paced step at a time. To sum it up indirectly: New York City is under attack. This clever film puts you right in the middle of it. How would you react in this situation? How would your friends react? How would the world react? Throughout the course of this movie, you might think about these questions.

I like disaster movies, and science-fiction, and it may have been the Planet of the Apes knock-off cover art that helped draw me in. It wasn't that bad, but... I was turned off from the very beginning. I really don't care for the Blair Witch type style of filming, but I think it worked a little better for this movie. In any case, it didn't make me quite as dizzy. The other problem with the beginning was that it was just, well... pointless. I think it was supposed to make us get to know and care about the characters, but it didn't. At least not for me. To me, they came across as college-age brats who do nothing but drink and party.

Oh well. The movie got better once the action started. I have the normal complaints, like the biggest one: nothing was ever explained, even by the end. I didn't think that was too bad, though, because of the whole ""perspective"" thing. (Although I would still like to know! After all, we are viewers, not participants.) How about when they went to save the girl and climbed 57 stories? No one does that and still speaks in complete sentences when they reach the top! If they even make it to the top.

During the party a really shocking event happens which scatters the partygoers and the videographer faithfully follows one group through all of their adventures in New York City as it is being destroyed around them.

The movie is intentionally choppy as one would expect under those circumstances and succeeds in presenting a sufficiently interesting story line that held my attention all the way through. As with most movies of this type you have to accept the basic assumptions of the movie to tolerate what happens but if you can the movie is pretty effective at telling its story.

The audience for this movie will be the sci-fi adventure, fantasy and horror movie crowd. Not a bad movie if you go in with your eyes open to the eccentricities it includes.",1330646400,2,884,4.771241830065359

1584518,3,B00005JPXY,"For most people, you either loved this film, or you completely despised it. As for me, there were things that I loved about this film, and things that I didn't care for. Cloverfield follows several twenty-somethings as they try to escape a city being attacked by a giant Godzilla-like creature.
I think that this film was a landmark in motion picture history in two ways. The first landmark is how they campaigned for the film. It was brilliant. Successfully keeping this movie in the dark, they released a trailer that showed us very little and only had a date instead of a title. People who looked up this date online found a website that only had a couple pictures. From here, the advertisers used a number of techniques to publicize the film and pique audiences' interest. The main website would be updated occasionally with pictures that gave clues about the stories. Several of the characters had MySpace pages and online video blogs. There were several fake news and business websites created to help give further background to the story. All in all, it was an amazing form of advertising that got audiences excited for the film and accounted for a great deal of profit that the studio could not have made any other way.
The second landmark is the way they filmed the movie. This is where most audience members grew to hate the film. The movie was filmed as if we saw everything from a handheld camera being used by one of the characters. This added a great deal of realism and believability to the story where we felt like we were watching a YouTube-like video of an actual event. But this also meant that there was a lot of camera-shake in the process and anyone who had motion-sickness did not make it far into the movie. While it's true that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;started the hand-held technique, I believe it was this film that showed the true potential and effectiveness of filming in this form. It was this film that started the hand-held craze and later inspired other films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quarantine/dp/B001MVYUR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quarantine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B002VKE1K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>.
Aside from that, the movie itself wasn't all that good. The movie echoed Godzilla a lot, so we felt like we had seen this film a dozen times before. There was really nothing to new to see. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of background story in the film. A lot of the background information was covered in the campaign sites for the film, but if you never looked at any of those, you were left with a lot of questions.

**Spoiler Alert**
Apparently, - and they don't tell you this in the film anywhere - the object landing in the ocean at the end of the film was a failed satellite that crashed to the earth and awoke a monster that had been hibernating underwater for thousands of years. The monster was supposed to be a baby looking for its mother.
**End Spoiler Alert**

Overall, the movie was a good thrill ride with lots of good special effects and scares, but not good enough to be seen over and over again.

As far as questionable content:
There is some violent monster mayhem, a couple of gore moments (one person is attacked by a monster and some blood sprays on the camera; a person explodes behind a curtain; one character is chewed up in the monster's mouth) and some profanity throughout the film.

This movie is about four of those people. They aren't the heroes and they don't really discover any crucial information to the monster's demise. They are just trying to get out of the city. If you go into to movie expecting just that, you won't be disappointed. If you are expecting some kind of deep, meaningful undertones, watch something else.

When someone says a movie is 'sickening', they usually mean either that the movie contained material which caused them to feel revulsion or they are using the word as hyperbole for 'very bad'. I am not using it in either of those senses. When I say this movie was 'sickening' I am using the term literally.

I suffer from motion sickness and have done so ever since I was a child. The effect of the hand-held camera was to cause continuous swaying and jerking of the images on the screen. Whether or not this was an effective way of communicating the message of the film I couldn't tell you. All I can say is that in me it induced severe nausea, such that I had to lie down in a dark room for a couple of hours until the feeling wore off.

My one-star rating is obviously completely subjective, since those who don't share my problem will be able to give reviews based on the entertainment value of the movie and I'm not doing that. However, for me, this was the worst movie that I've ever seen; the only one to have made me physically ill.

1584571,4,B00005JPXY,"Monster movies are a weird bunch, some are downright awful, some are worse, for the most part they are all terribly cliched and pretty much the same. A monster attacks, levels a few buildings, kills or eats people and must be turned back by a mere few who are willing to step up to it and fight back.

""Cloverfield"" has all of these cliches, including characters who do stupid things to advance the story. The difference between those previous monster films and ""Cloverfield"" is it is filmed from one of the actors handheld cameras that somehow manages to survive numerous monster attacks, buildings that collapse and plenty of explosions.

While the acting isn't all that great there are some legit reactions to the terror and destruction from the actors as they keep trying to escape this monstrous 200 foot tall beast. The monster is somewhat unique looking, the main actresses are very attractive and there are some pretty good effects and great scares in this.

There's really not much of a story as after the initial monster attacks, three of the actors go to rescue the main guys girlfriend (Odette Yustman, ""The Unborn""), which leads to some good sequences.

There are a few unexplained things as a lot about the creature is kept a mystery, the short running time does work in the movies favor as it was constant action with only a few slow parts. ""Cloverfield"" is enjoyable and is certainly a major step up from other monster movies. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.",1322179200,,1465,4.733333333333333

Half Godzilla,half Blair Witch,Cloverfield gives the monster movie genre a new staple and spark that has now been copied many a times sense.

I really want to rate this movie higher but their are too many instances where the film just stretches what I can actually believe. I can buy into the monster and all the chaos which therefore follows. However, I can't buy into the fact a woman can be impaled one minute atop a building on the verge of collapse and then be running for her life 10 minutes later.
I also laugh at the very notion that this huge monster can take down a rescue helicopter that kills both helmet wearing pilots yet the three civilians without any protective padding whatsoever all manage to live and guess what else is still going strong? That's right the camcorder! Thus some liberties are taken almost to the extreme to pull off the handheld effect the movie goes for.

But in saying all that Cloverfield is still a movie I enjoyed,just not one I fell in love with. It has some truly creepy scenes and does manage to tug at your emotions in brief intervals,i just found it to stretch the level of realism more into the fantastic than I was willing to believe.",1321660800,,1336,4.516528925619835
1584573,3,B00005JPXY,"Hey, it's not terribly awful.  Just a bit lacking in the ""story"" department.  By which I mean someone should have invested a little more time in trying to come up with an actual ending, that, in the time-honored fashion, kind of resolves most things in the film in a way that we the viewers might find entertaining.

Now I'm not saying the ending doesn't fit.  It's just not very entertaining.  It's the kind of an ending that highlights the difference between a film with an ending and a film that just ends.

I wouldn't recommend buying Cloverfield, though it's probably worth watching once.  I happened to catch it on one of the MTV channels on Halloween at like two in the morning.  I felt in a mood to watch whatever might be on TV.  And I could have done a lot worse.

In the first half of the film it actually made sense.
We find action, imagination, and most all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction movie contained herein but... It has the aesthetic trappings of science fiction but it's really more of a character drama. ""Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching"" is how Rotten Tomatoes put it.

I pretty much got my wish.  I also liked the yuppie romance as well, as that also would fulfill any hopeless romantic's wish.  There was some pretty extreme destruction, a decent amount of good military hardware, lots of tense moments, and reasonably intelligent characters who weren't making too many really dumb decisions...except for the romantically-driven ones (depending on how you look at it)!

All in all it was much better than I expected.  I sure hope one of these monsters never shows up, however! In spite of the shellacking the military was giving it, it didn't want to die!",1316390400,,886,4.764705882352941

1584579,4,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is a neat take on the giant monster running amuck theme.

The film is presented as recovered camcorder footage shot by some unfortunate eyewitnesses.

The whole story of how the camcorder got into a certain person's hands and the peripheral  events leading up to the monster's rampage are cleverly done. Out of the small group of people that the film follows, I found myself pulling mainly for the clown behind the camera. Hud's story was the most poignant.

Though the movie has many dramatic moments, there's a lot of humor in here, and when the main theme plays during the end credit roll, you get the feeling that they didn't take themselves too seriously, and I think that's why the film works.

Most people that slammed this movie had objections to the way it was shot, but I thought the ""Blair Witch"" style of shooting worked well considering how the story is told. The destruction special effects seemed pretty darn realistic.  It was the monster itself that I found kind-of unconvincing.  It reminded me of the Rancor beast that Luke takes on in Star Wars Episode 6 (interestingly enough,  Phil Tippett was involved in both projects). Plus, there are bound to be comparisons to ""Godzilla"".

Sometimes that can distract from the movie, in my opinion. I also like the fact that Hud would interject funny comments during some of the most suspenseful scenes, like when he comments that no one ever listens to him, and when they finally do, they die.

1584621,1,B00005JPXY,"This is a terrible movie! Unbelievable, silly, immature, frustrating, moronic characters, silly plot, bad acting, and the monster is tragically ho hum.

The movie does not get going until about 17 minutes after the opening. You have to sit and watch a going away party for a friend, but it's more like a teenage romance gossip festival. The cameraman ""Hud"" tries to pick up his crush using middle school tactics and is so annoying you are hoping the monster eats him first. The character doesn't get any better. Hud spews out what I assume are bits of comic relief at unfunny moments in the movie all while holding on to the camera and recording.

The actors continue to use the camera throughout the entire ordeal. The camera survives the monster attacking, crashes, burials, other monsters and other trauma. Who makes this camera? I want to buy one if it can stand this much punishment!

The monster, when revealed, looks boring, uninteresting, and not frightening. Unusual, yes, but for some reason, not particularly compelling to look at. I went ahead and looked at some of the extras and was amazed and how much effort seemed to go into creating this monster, when the results were so bland.

The acting from all cast members is disappointing and unbelievable; Hud especially. I never believed any of them were in NY running from a monster; I believed all of them were in a movie. I had to laugh out loud at one of the last lines of the movie when the guy points the camera to the girl and she says that she can't think of anything to say.

The plot is awful. The army seems to arrive on Manhattan with tanks, medical equipment and scores of troops in 15 minutes, even with a bridge destroyed. People are mortally injured or should be and seem to have no problem getting up and running for their lives.

The monster itself was never explored, infact it took an extra feature to even reveal that the creature was a hatchling.  All in all it was another example of Hollywood using the creature as simply a McGuffin Device - simply something to build a weak story around.  Even the Brits got it right with ""Gorgo"" by  following the Japanese in showing that monsters can be characters in their own story and often have a natural cause for their behavior, often enough to make the viewer wonder just who the real ""monsters"" are - a creature somehow wronged by man or man himself for not taking responcability for his mistakes.

1584683,5,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is a pretty scary movie. It has a bit of everything in it. Horror, action, romance, comedy, drama; it has a lot of genres into it. The film isn't very long, and it may not have a lot to it, but it's still a very-well executed movie. The opening card in the beginning was pretty cool, with that ""government"" and ""case designate Cloverfield"" thing. That was an interesting way to begin the film. It finally rolls into the actual footage. The character development in the beginning was good, and I read  that in the reviews for this movie that the characters were ""one-dimensional"", but in basically every ""found-footage"" film the people are one-dimensional. I bet nobody would be complaining about that if the film had regular camera cuts and weren't found footage.
  Anyway, besides that, after about 18 minutes, the action finally begins with a loud boom. This movie is more intense because it's a large group of people screaming and freaking out. Another thing that makes this film pretty creepy is that it has this ""apocalypse"" feel to it. There's a lot of running and terror in the film. I guess the running made people get motion sickness, but it's their fault that they got motion sickness. They're the ones who saw the movie and they saw that it was done on video camera, and it obviously involves running, so it's basically their fault. I like the extreme shaky camera, and the pixelation, and how in some scenes it would cut back to footage from a month ago for a couple seconds. I also like those freaky-looking spider creatures in that one subway scene. The special effects were also great (it only had a $25 million budget).
  I like how they only show little bits and pieces of the monster throughout the movie and at the end you finally see the whole thing in front of the camera. It's pretty scary looking. The end obviously doesn't explain everything (that's what a lot of people complained about), but I actually think it ended really well, with a cliffhanger. At the last shot in the movie, I like when it cuts back to a month ago and the last line in the movie is ""I had a good day"". The film may not have a lot to it, like I said before. It plays out like this, the ""a month ago"" scene, the party scene, the running scene, the subway scene, the mall scene, hotel scene, and it finally shows the monster and after that there's a couple more minutes. It may sound like a good amount, but for a movie that's not much. I'm not complaining about it, because I think the movie actually played out really well.
  The audio at the way end when you hear ""Help us"" and when it's played backwards, you hear ""It's still alive"", was pretty cool, because it adds on to the cliffhanger effect, and it does make the movie even more creepier.

1584685,3,B00005JPXY,"To keep this brief for all, Cloverfield is indeed and entertaining film. The mystery used by Abrams along with the unorthodox storyline helped the story to become fascinating. The special effects were good and creating the illusion of confusion and panic using the video-cam focal point is a nice touch that you'll either love or hate.

The biggest problem I have with the film is the idea that a story like this needs a sequel and now that 2 years has passed without even talk of one, buiding up all this detailed backstory, clues and other data was meaningless without a sequel so what Abrams actually accomplished was a lot of smoke and no sizzle. Why invest so much time developing the storyline for an unknown moster when you plan to do nothing with it goes beyond logic. I hope to see a sequel one day although I'd advise Mr. Abrams to tie up all the loose ends with this next version because time on this plot and character has already run it's course and already are problematic. This movie in essence is the definition of ""wasted effort"" and it should have been more than it was. My guess is that they made the film and didn't make the desired income on the project and abandoned it. It definitely would be a fun rental but I wouldn't suggest buying it unless your a fan or see it on sale for less than it would cost to rent.",1300060800,,1334,4.40080971659919

It did pretty good actually, very interesting film.  I went to see this in Long Beach i remember, early in the morning actually.  Great film.

1584689,1,B00005JPXY,"This film has 2 serious issues that makes watching this film intolerable;

1. The camerawork. I know that the purpose of shaky cam is to add realism and involve the audience but in this film, it was very distracting. Distracting to the point where my head was beginning to ache from the constant wobbling and swaying in all the shots. The constant squealing and ""oh my gods"" in my ear did not help either. Also, the constant jerking of the camera combined with the dark lighting meant that any semi exciting event was just ""blink and you'll miss it"".

2. The characters. I wasn't expecting any characterization or interesting dialogue to occur given the scenario but if your life is in danger, no one would huddle in groups on the street crying, ""oh my god oh god oh god"". They would be trying to survive! In my opinion, a good action/thriller is driven by a balance between common sense and emotion within the character. In this film, the main characters were too melodramatic and emotional. There's a scene where they hear sounds behind them and instead of sprinting in the opposite direction quietly, they turn TWICE and just stand there listening to it while 2 of them flap around with the night vision on the camera. The entire scene would be improved if they did the common sensical thing but still get attacked.

Unmoving, uninteresting and migraine inducing.",1291852800,7,1366,4.73109243697479

The movie starts off attempting to establish the characters but alas the characters come across as being one dimensional, for whom I have very little, if any, empathy for.  The dialogue from the camera operator becomes annoying.  And as each character dies there is a pervading sense of ""oh well, no great loss there"".

1584758,1,B00005JPXY,"This film may appeal to the younger movie-goers, but certainly not to anyone over 30. It is a badly-made ""monster goes berserk in NY"" film.

The first 20 minutes is like watching a poorly produced home movie full of partying people you don't know. The conversations are senseless and do nothing to propel the plot forward.

The camera shakes, rolls and dips constantly, actually tipping completely sideways several times without reason or obvious cause.  It gets worse when the creature finally makes his appearance. The camera starts making 180-degree dizzying sweeps of the street, always managing to capture people screaming, panicking and looting, but never capturing more than a one-second glimpse of the monster. Only when someone stops to talk on their cell phone does the camera stop shaking for a few minutes.

Unlike the Blair Witch Project, which gave birth to the Shaky Camera Realism Syndrome, the viewer never connects with the characters, and therefore really doesn't care what happens to them.

Cloverfield is a typical chase-and-run monster flick where the actors do little more than flee from a creature we never see clearly until the last five minutes of the movie. The movie's main purpose is to stimulate chaos by bobbing the camera back and forth, hoping to create realism, but it fails miserably. How does a woman survive being impaled through the chest by a steel rod, yet manage to run down 100 flight of stairs to a waiting helicopter? Probably the same way the helicopter passengers survived a fall from 1000's of feet in the air after the helicopter crashes to the street below. Realism? Not a chance.

The movie ends abruptly and without an explanation of what the creature is, where he came from, and whether or not he is killed by the military.",1287446400,7,1775,4.919732441471572

The movie presents as a standard (albeit with a second person-voice twist) SciFi Horror film with the (now) usual scenes: half-glimpses of a truly hideous creature, CGI destruction of expensive real estate, ""alien"" larval stages scurrying after the heroes in confined darkness (contact with whom leads to a messy end).  But we quickly realize something is off: a tiny love story, an asterisk really, begins to unfold.  In 3-second cuts, the playback from a damaged video-camera interleaves snippets of old footage with the main action of the film, recorded over it.  Gradually we begin to care more about Beth and Rob's doomed relationship, forever frozen in time by the camera, than NYC's horrific demise.

We, the audience, are like archaeologists, who excavating Pompeii 1500 years after Vesuvius erupted, discovered cavities in the lava which entombed the village.

1584824,2,B00005JPXY,"The 2008 monster movie, ""Cloverfield"" stars Michael Stahl-David, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan and Odette Yustman and is directed by Matt Reeves. The film is centered on a major monster attack in New York City that effect a group of young adults.

The film starts off with the group of young adults attending a going away party for their friend, Rob(Michael Stahl-David). At the party, Rob's friend Hud(T.J. Miller) is videotaping everyone's farewells to Rob. The movie, is told from Hud's video camera the entire time. During the party, things start to get out of hand when a huge monster strikes the city and chaos begins.

This movie was a disappointment for me. I for one, am not really into scary or horror type films, even though this didn't exactly fill that genre. I guess it'd be cateogorized more as a thriller, but even so I was disappointed. The ending was in my opinion, horrible. There was a huge buildup to nothing. A lot of characters came and went quite quickly that it was hard to care for them.

I did enjoy that it actually looked like it was filmed by this character Hud the entire time. I really really liked that aspect of it, because it made it more real and more exciting to the story.  It felt like everything that was happening in the city and with these characters was real and genuine. But like I said before, it was hard to really care for these characters because some of them weren't in it for that long so I wasn't exactly sad to see them go.

The story was unique, it starts off as some sort of romantic drama with Rob leaving for Japan and also leaving the love of his life, Beth(Odette Yustman). They are best friends who love each other but of course neither of them know it, and on the camcorder there are videos of Beth and Rob having sweet conversations and having a really great time together but then disaster strikes and the audience is reminded that they are watching a monster flick. So, I really enjoyed seeing snippets of happier times through the camera and trying to understand their relationship.

I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys monster movies and anyone who can view 85 minutes of film on a shaky hand held camera. It was decent, but I definitely wouldn't watch it again.

Cloverfield is likewise a more clever piece of marketing than cinema. The problem I have with movie fiction masquerading as real amateur footage is that it can actually seem less real.

Maybe I'm unusual in this but heck, I can't help that. Having said all this Cloverfield is better than TBWP.

There was no plot; a mind-numbing amount of the movie was spent watching, through a jerking camera lens, a going-away party for someone who wasn't even present.  It went on FOREVER.  I kept waiting for something exciting to happen at any moment, which caused me to waste precious moments of my life--ones that I can never get back :(  The ""monsters,"" who were incredibley laughable in their appearance, and only appeared at the very end of the movie, were not believable at all.

1584873,2,B00005JPXY,"A loathsome claim, of course, but can you argue that ""Cloverfield""'s premise is anything but?  The Empire State Building collapses floor upon floor, pancake-flat, while a cloud of debris billows from the urban canyons; a rain of office papers falls upon the survivors staggering about, their hair plastered with ash.  Brand me a stiff, but I avoided ""Cloverfield"" for a long time due to moral objections.  Curiosity eventually got the better of me  -  but served only to reinforce my original opinion.

The 9/11 imagery is not only tasteless but ensures that the movie never works.  We see all this real-world imagery, all this terror with which we're familiar, and then we see that it's being caused by...a giant lizard-thing.  It's as if we were expected to take seriously the latest Al-Qaeda taped video threat were it recorded by Popeye.  The dissonance never heals; I could never suspend my disbelief, and this is from a woman who sat by happily while Jeff Goldblum once disabled an alien fleet with a mid-'90's PowerBook.  The scenario's not scary when it's wrought by something that can't possibly exist because we've already seen it happen from something that does.

The other elements of the film fail to mitigate this.  Of the characters, only Marlena is sympathetic and sensible and dares actually to do stuff despite the perceived handicap of two X chromosomes; the rest of the cast consists of spoiled prissies waiting for the men to rescue them or dudebros, both types badly acted all around.  The camerawork, particularly in the first half, is often poor  -  and, yes, I know it's a cinema vrit shakycam effort.  Compare it, though, to ""Blair Witch"" or ""REC,"" which were convincingly on-the-spot amateur yet allowed us to see what the filmmakers needed us to see; in ""Cloverfield,"" it's often just plain impossible to make out ongoing events.  (Plot necessity, though, makes the camerawork unbelievably, ridiculously perfect in certain scenes near the end.)

The film does get better when it kicks the 9/11 stuff  -  see the effectively creepy subway scenes  -  but it never develops into anything worthy of the imagery it invokes.  ""Cloverfield"" isn't disturbing; it's just stupid.",1269820800,2,2197,5.00828729281768

Not only did this intensify my headache, it also made me rage to no end! I just want to see the friggin action, not your stupid scared friends doing nothing!!!

1584876,4,B00005JPXY,"I agree with J.J. Abrams that America deserves a monster, a giant monster, like Godzilla that sticks in the psyche of the American people for generations. Alas, Godzilla, who was the inspiration for Cloverfield has his roots in the horrors of America dropping the Atomic Bomb on 2 cities to win WWII. Godzilla, a monster born from atom bomb testing embodies something that the Japanese will always remember. The origin of the Cloverfield monster is unknown. Is it an inadvertently man-made monster? Is it a monster from the deepest part of the ocean or is it from outer space? Who knows? And while that is a burning question throughout the movie, it is never answered. There are many things that work for the movie, but after awhile they have the opposite effect. I have seen the movie 3 times, including once in the movie theater. Twice I have gotten nauseated from the handheld, bouncy camera work. I get it. Its a Youtube like look at a large scale disaster, parts of which were inspired by 9/11. But the movie goes overboard with the handheld camera movement. This last time I watched it I had to take Tylenol from a headache centered right behind my eyes. And that is my biggest complaint because the movie is well made, with a good storyline and has characters you care about. But the camera work went overboard to emulate what is seen on Youtube news reports. Will there be a sequel, one shot traditionally? I hope so. And how can there not be a sequel, if this is supposted to be America's Godzilla.  I recommend that anyone into Sci-Fi or even horror see the film, it is a scary movie.

This is a fun little sci-fi flick.  It would have been a lot better if they had scrapped the first half-hour where we were getting to know the empty headed yuppies.  That was entirely unnecessary, since these ""characters"" were simply window dressing.  It reminded me a lot of the old 50's science fiction movies in many ways. maybe that was intentional - who knows.  It almost felt like a parody sometimes.

We eventually get to the part where a horrifying giant creature raises havoc in Manhattan, and that's a lot of fun. I also got a lot of unintentional amusement from some of the ridiculous inconsistencies in the movie; for example, the girlfriend who was able to run like the wind after having her chest speared with a piece of rebar.

1584878,5,B00005JPXY,"All the secrecy that went into the filmmaking of Cloverfield really paid off.  I went into the show with no knowledge of the plot, thanks to the eerie trailer, and wound up actually being excited during the viewing.  With all the spoilers in your face everywhere on the internet, it's hard to really be suprised anymore.  What movies like Cloverfield and The Dark Knight did, is they committed much of their time to protecting the material from being exposed.  When movies like X-men Origins: Wolverine are leaked, they lose their theater appreciation before they are released.  Cloverfield had to be one of the best big monster movies next to Peter Jackson's King Kong.  Its incredibly real and involving.  Those who are sensitive to shaky camera motions, may not appreciate it as much, but know that it is all for a sense of reality.  I couldn't bear to watch the Bourne movies because they were filmed poorly, but Cloverfield does ""shaky-cam"" right and respects the limits of my equilibrium and stomach.

So after Cloverfield comes to Blu-ray, is it the same experience? No, but I still enjoy it and I see something new in it every time I view it.  It becomes on of those movies that you have to show people unaware of it.  The special features are ok.  I wanted the trailer on the disc as well as some more polished behind-the-scenes.  Star Trek had a much better disc delivery from J.J. Abrahms.  I'm upset to see the 3 star average review due to the pickiness of the cinematography.  I understand where you're coming from as long as you respect why it was made this particular way.  They didn't film it on a handycam to make it look cool.  They filmed it that way to make you feel a part of the show, and to make a monster movie as realistic as possible.  All the bumblings and jump cuts, just bring reality to the man behind the camera.  I think the shakiness only works in a film like this, where the one filming is a part of the cast.  What sense does it make to shake around the camera filming the Bourne Supremacy, when the view is the eye of God.  The one filming in those unnecessarily shaky movies is not a part of the cast.

But anyway, I accept the mixed feelings people have for this movie.  I am one of the people who enjoyed it thoroughly in theaters and at home.  I am pushing a movement for directors and screenwriters to keep the entire production a secret while filming.  All these online set visits are going to destroy peoples experiences when the movie is released.  Films like ""The Dark Knight"", ""Cloverfield"", and ""Zombieland""(for its fantastic celebrity cameo) get so much credit for shocking audiences in their reveal.  I challenge filmmakers to suprise me.",1266796800,3,2687,4.590336134453781
1584879,4,B00005JPXY,"The central conceit of the film is that we are watching footage retrieved from a handicam belonging to a member of the public and found by the authorities at a location ""formerly known as Central Park"" after an event code-named Cloverfield. The footage follows a group of six odious yuppie friends whose evening started off at a surprise farewell party held at a giant downtown loft for one of their number who was due to start a new job in Japan. Their self-important world is then thrust into a bleaker reality as a huge thud shakes the city and the embodiment of a collective nightmare arrives in a furious rampage of violent destruction. Monster shaped it has been called al-Qaedzilla by some, others merely scream ""Oh My Godzilla!"" All we have to go on is the frenetic, dizzying hand-held footage, no explanations just the fearful claustrophobia of the lens' parameters.

As the city is ferociously assaulted by this seemingly vengeful beast the images of the destruction look chillingly familiar as streets serve as focused conduits for choking toxic dust and masonry. No accident, some scenes could easily be that first news footage from 9/11 which has led most to conclude that the monster is an allegorical terrorist. But could the partnership of Producer JJ Abrams who together with writer Drew Goddard brought us the twists and turns of Alias and the maddening mysteries of Lost really be so simplistic in Cloverfield?

Seeming to appear from nowhere the Cloverfield monster is apparently impervious to conventional weaponry and seems to be driven by unrestrained rage, making us mindful of the monster from the id, (in the 1956 sci-fi classic `Forbidden Planet') a manifestation of the unconscious. In an age when the propagation of fear is used as a form of social control and given liberties are taken away, could this monster represent the terrible collective rage of a whole national psyche, symbolically ripping the head off a hollow statue of liberty and tossing it away as one of it's first acts?

Perhaps the famous New Yorker, American icon and poet Walt Whitman lends his weight to these ideas. In his poem ""Give Me The Splendid Silent Sun"" which contains the line `Keep your fields of clover. . ."" he says;-

""O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries.
 I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.""

1584927,3,B00005JPXY,"Like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT before it and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY after it, CLOVERFIELD is a mockumentary horror film consisting of footage taken from a handheld camera. Unlike the others in its subgenre, it makes great use of fantastic and expensive special effects that are so seamlessly integrated into the rest of the film, particularly in the collapse of the Woolworth Building near the onset of the mayhem, that you really feel like you're seeing what it would be like if a giant monster attacked Manhattan. (In this it stands apart not only from its closest thematic equivalents, the dreadful recent remake of GODZILLA and also the three versions of KING KONG.) The dreadful mistake the moviemakers made was to use as its central characters a group of spoiled, self-indulgent twentysomethings in Manhattan, and involve us in their tedious romantic doings to a great extent before the attacks on the city finally begin so we have an unconvincing excuse for why the characters would not try to leave the evacuated island and try to save another character trapped in a collapsed building in midtown. (Worst of all, the camera is held among this Scooby-Doo gang by the Shaggy character, who is supposed to serve as comic relief.) The most fun in the movie are the shots over the characters shoulders of the crossfire between the military and the rampaging monster (at which you never get a good view until the very end, when the filmmakers unwisely spoil the mystery by giving us a long lingering look at it). The film may make some queasy morally at its resonances with 9/11, and others literally with its restless handheld roving shots.",1259280000,2,1638,4.89568345323741

But before too long, the ground shakes. At first, they think it is an earthquake. In New York? Before long, they realize that something horrid is happening in Manhattan. Can they get off the island alive?

The film is supposed to be a documentary as filmed entirely by Hud. As a result, we get one camera. And it is a very shaky camera at that. This was part of my problem with the film. I actually got motion sick in the theater and had to leave about three quarters of the way into it. It's probably much better on home video than on the big screen, but I don't care to try again.

See, I didn't like any of the characters.  All of them were self absorbed and irritating.  Heck, I wanted the monster to win so the movie would be over.  Not that this is the actors' fault.  They were great as these spoiled kids.  Sorry, I meant adults.

I do have to give the special effects credit.  They were good.

1584971,5,B00005JPXY,"After all the hype (pro AND con), I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is one of the most intelligently written sc-fi/horror flix I've ever seen.

There's a bit of subtle social satire buried between the lines, and a pretty fair amount of incidental humor as well... particularly in the early ""party"" sequence, which starts with every indication of just being another boring ""yuppie tweens in trouble"" yawner. Don't be fooled, though... that's just the set-up, and it really helps to pay attention to all the details (if only to try to keep all the names straight, later.) It doesn't take long before all hell suddenly breaks loose, and you are convincingly sucked into the chaos and panic of the emergency that ensues.

Not to be too much of a spoiler, but I particularly enjoyed the touch of having the film being represented as a ""found"" going-away party tape, which happened to accidentally erase most of an earlier, date movie made by one of the main characters... this really helps to flesh out the personalities and adds to what is a surprisingly deft character development for this type of film. (Hint--pay attention when the unerased parts of the earlier video peep through.)

I also appreciated the fact that when things really hit the fan, the viewer never knows much more about what's going on than the movie's characters. This really adds to the suspense, and draws you emotionally into their viewpoint, and the immediacy and confusion of their plight. Also helpful is the lack of a dramatic or trendy hit-laden film score. Though they may have lost in after-marketing, they gained in atmosphere, and realism.

One warning though-- if you didn't like the jerky hand-held camera and the you've-got-to do-some-thinking-to-know-what's-happening aspect of, say, the Blair Witch Project, then you won't like this flick either. Some people get downright queasy when the camera isn't balanced by those expensive studio gyros, y'know? And maybe also when they actually have to think things through, rather than just sitting & screaming at splattering blood and severed body parts.

To wrap up, I thoroughly enjoy this DVD-- It's a keeper. The story line is surprisingly well planned and executed, especially considering the relatively small budget. And the writers don't insult the viewer by ""explaining"" everything at a jr-high school level, as so many films do these days. The acting is actually quite good, for the most part (again, a pleasant surprise). The, um, ""critters"" are well conceived, well represented, and pretty damned convincing.

The only real complaint I've got with this film is minor, and probably directly due to the budget limitations-- there's a rather obvious inaccuracy regarding the size of the statue of liberty's head-- you'll know what I mean when you see it.",1256860800,,2801,5.065075921908893
1584972,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield takes on a familiar movie subject, a monster appears out of nowhere and attacks New York City, destroying landmarks, crushing cars and eating people. The military is called in to deal with the beast. What makes Cloverfield unique is the way it is filmed and the fact that it doesn't attempt to explain what the monster is or where it came from.

The entire movie is the recording of a personal video camera that was being used at a party to record the going away messages for the guest of honor. Because the guy manning the camera is a doofus we also get to eavesdrop on conversations that weren't meant for the tape, but help set up character development. When the attack begins everyone runs outside naturally to see what's going on and the doofus never puts down the camera believing that the event should be recorded for history.

The rest of the movie we tag along with a group of friends as they try to rescue an injured friend from her destroyed apartment building and then find a way out of the city while the military attempts to destroy the monster.

I enjoyed Cloverfield. I thought the story was told in a clever way and the characters were believable. The special effects were good as well. Overall an interesting take on the monster movie genre.",1256774400,,1271,4.590308370044053

It was different than your typical film because you the viewer watch everything through the view of a camcorder as if what you were seeing really happened.

Beyond that the special effects were great from the decapitated Lady of Liberty to the monster(s).

Even though there isn't any real graphic violence or nasty language (which is much appreciated), I'd say avoid watching this with young children, as it can be very intense and most likely terrifying for children.

1585041,4,B00005JPXY,"Okay -- everyone has talked about the shaky camera work, the monster movie aspect, the limited backstory and exposition, and that it might not be the most horrific horror movie ever, but I think that these commentaries miss the point.  What ultimately makes a movie work (or not), is whether we care about the characters, and Cloverfield succeeds because we root for Rob (played by Michael Stahl-David) to save and reunite with Beth (Odette Yustman), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) and Hud (T.J. Rogers) provide enough wit, sarcasm, humor and reality to keep us grounded and  involved.  The conceit of the single camcorder gives the movie a reality Youtube feel that heightens the illusion that these are real people, not just actors.

The story in a nutshell is that a video has been recovered that shows what happens the night a horrific monster attacks New York.  It was supposed to be a testimonial tape for Rob as he prepares to go to Japan, and it was shot over a tape he made of a magical day he spent with Beth.  This way we get some of Rob and Beth's backstory at strategic intervals, we get introduced to the characters, and the horror story that unfolds is an accident of time and fate.

It feels like the moviemakers -- JJ Abrams produced it, Matt Rees directed --must have felt that the 1998 remake of Godzilla was a missed opportunity, because this feels like an extended commentary on that film.  Like that movie, we don't see the monster fully for most of the film.  Unlike that film, this story is not about the military, scientists, etc. trying to fight the monster (though they are certainly present), but how ordinary people might experience the night.  As such it is much more successful.

The jittery style may be tough to take at moments, but this is a film definitely worth seeing, and I think it will stick with you a little longer than the average horror movie because of the relationships at its heart.",1252281600,,1925,4.648967551622419

1585044,1,B00005JPXY,"First of all ... just how stupid are the people of New York City?  When their city was under attack by this monster, the people of New York did EVERYTHING wrong!!
When buildings were coming down and the head from the Statue of Liberty was flung thousands of yards (crushing somebody's car upon impact) people SHOULD have started running, but instead they stood in the street and talked about it and took pictures with their cell phones.  Do these people have no self preservation insinct at all?

Next we see the looting going on.  People stealing CD players, speakers and other consumer electronics.  I'm sorry, but if your city is under attack and your life is in danger and you're going to make time for looting, STEAL A HANDGUN OR A SHOTGUN AND SOME AMMO!!  Survival is more important than audio or video equipment!!

Also, when they bomb the monster, WHY did they send in a B2 Stealth Bomber?  The U.S. Airforce has other bombers that would have been much better suited for the job.  The B2 is slow, maneuvers poorly and has a history of navigational problems.  The ONLY advantage to the B2 Stealth bomber is that it's stealth technology means that it can evade detection on certain types of radar.

Did the U.S. military REALLY believe that this monster was tracking our aircraft with some sort of radar?

And when the evac helicopter tries to fly the civilians to safety shouldn't it have flown AWAY from the monster, rather than heading towards and directly OVER IT?  Doesn't that fly right in the face of good sense?  Sure, it LOOKED more dramatic that way, but flying over a 10-story monster that's being hit with artillery is a good way to get killed.

The premise was good. Kids, a camera, and a disaster. No context, no explanations, just sudden catastrophe and confusion, filmed by someone clumsy. On that level, it was extremely well presented. Great special effects. Great audio. Everything from the flickering of the lights to the background noises, was timed to be eerie, disturbing or intensely interesting. You don't look away.

So why didn't it work better?

Part of the problem is that the movie is so derivative. It feels too much like a cash-in on 9/11, and it feels too much like a gigantic homage to Alien. Somehow you feel like you've seen all this before. It's Godzilla, done bigger and better for the sake of bigger and better. Aliens, but scaled up.

Part of the problem is, as well as the actors conveyed terror, fear, bravery and foolishness, at no time did it feel authentic - and they tried so very, very hard to be real. I think it was more the storyline's fault than the acting. The characters just don't engage, even though the script was filled with events and points that just begged you to care about them. Somehow, the plot just tried too hard to make you care. But I was rooting for the monster the whole way.

If you can find it cheap and really want to see a believable enactment of disaster response and chaos, this is a good choice. But it's not something I expect to see again.

1585048,2,B00005JPXY,"Warning - Movie spoilers

Cloverfield's special effects were very good.  Many scenes most definitely got the viewer's blood pumping in fear such as the subway attack and when those things jumped off the monster and attacked a man while soldiers were fighting in the street.  There were many truly frightening episodes throughout this film.  The bouncing camera recording made it realistic as it reflected exactly what was occurring around the man holding it.  But, this film squandered so much potential.

The first 19 minutes were incredibly boring spent by Rob's best friend Hudson video recording people at Rob's going away to Japan party saying goodbye. Among the party attendees were Rob's ex-girlfriend Beth at the party with a new boyfriend, Jason (Rob's brother), Lily (Jason's girlfriend) and Marlena (Rob's acquaintance).  Then Beth gets embarrassed and leaves Rob's party because Lily blabs that Beth slept with Rob to Hudson who blabbed it to everyone he filmed.  Lily should have known better then to tell Hudson as Hudson was such an obvious big kid.  Karma gets Hudson but he didn't deserve it nearly as much as the 2 stars of this film.

The contrast of the movie is supposed to be between a happy Coney Island Rob/Beth trip being taped over by the unfolding horror of monsters attacking New York.  The real contrast turns out to be between wimpy Beth against the the growing courage of Lily and Hudson and Marlena who kicked monster booty saving each other with Marlena saving Hudson and getting severely injured and later dying in the process.  Two brave young people die trying to rescue one unworthy Beth. Another contrast was between Jason (strong) and his brother Rob (weak and rightfully called a douche bag by his own brother).  The adage the ""good die young""  inversely means the not so good live and this was very apparent in Cloverfield.

Cloverfield's plot called for Rob to be the knight in shining armor and to rescue the helpless damsel Beth in distress regardless who dies doing it.  Laughably, she is actually found laying on her back with her eyes closed like Cinderella with clean fresh hair spread around her head in an enticing manner.  Amazingly all that thick 9-11 dust floating around from downed/damaged buildings never graced her body.  Even more laughable, Beth alternatively feigns between leaning on Rob to walk to running like a sprinter. The movie tries to have it both ways but the same adrenaline that got her running like a sprinter and lifting heavy debris off Rob after the helicopter crash SHOULD have gotten her up off that apartment floor and that single rod though a shoulder and outside to find safety by herself.

Initially after the monster attacks, Lily and Marlena act like flighty airheads ineptly running in high heels incapable of making a rational decision in an dire situation. Rob acts like a complete airhead feeling guilty because Beth is not with him and endangers the whole group going after her after Beth calls him to come get her because she ""can't move"". Turns out Beth was NOT hurt so bad that she could NOT have pulled herself off that thin rod which was only though a shoulder and not a vital organ and walk down those stairs to meet Rob/group of friends SOMEWHERE safer than Beth's dangerous apartment.  Beth certainly had no problem running down 57 flights of stairs after Rob and the rest came for her despite her ""injury"" and running like the wind when they got outside.

When Rob/Beth/Hudson took off in a military helicopter there were at least 2 soldiers possibly more with them.  When it crashes, these 2 losers (Rob/Beth) never checked to see if any military personnel were still alive after calling out and finding each other because this film is all about them.  While Hudson acted childish initially, he was was growing up fast and realizing a budding relationship with Marlena as she admires his courage and he hers but alas both die horribly in an effort to save Beth.  Hudson and Marlena could have been evacuated at the beginning of the film or walked out another way after the bridge collapsed.  Hudson could also have been evacuated at the soldier's camp where Marlena died but he didn't want to let his best friend Rob down and continued to follow him.

The plot could have been so much better if it showed the strengths of all the characters.  Beth could have called Rob and they all agreed to meet somewhere in the middle.  The film could have shown the courage of Beth getting off her butt out of that building and the hardships both groups endured making their way to this middle ground. This film squandered lives to save one undeserving one.  What a sad film when viewers find more interest/hope in the relationships between the fast maturing Hudson's budding romance with Marlena and the relationship between Jason/Lily than they are in the fake Rob/Beth.

A fitting ending for the in love selfish Rob and Beth who caused their friends to die and who cared about no one but themselves.  ""After the credits a brief radio call is heard, saying ""Help us"" (meaning Rob/Beth). If played backwards, the audio states ""Its still alive"".  If karma is real, no one will rescue Beth a second time and the Hammerdown Protocol involved nuclear bombs so it won't matter if these 2 losers get out or not because the radiation will get them.",1246752000,2,5329,4.796498905908097

When it was over, I wanted an hour and a half of my life back.  I don't think that the presence of the ""MST3K"" cast would've helped this film any.",1246320000,20,426,4.275

I held off on seeing it for a while because I had heard about people getting motion sick in the theater, and I'm pretty prone to that, but I had no such problems watching this on DVD.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it's because I've always liked the big-monster-attacks-city movie concept, but had never really seen it done that well.  This movie just nailed it.  You really get the feeling of what it would be like to be in the city while an unknown creature is causing destruction.  I know a few people who've seen this film and who didn't like it as much as I did, so this may be the kind of movie that is just for certain types and not others.  Then again, I think most fans of action/thriller/sci-fi type movies would really enjoy this one.

And the hack-n-slash gorefest crap that passes for horror these days is almost not worth the time it takes to yawn through them.  So when I find a good, solid monster movie that makes me tense up and say ""Oh my god!"" at least once, I know I'm on to something.

If you don't already know, Cloverfield is set in post-9/11 Manhattan.  During a Bon Voyage party, something attacks the city, decapitating the Statue of Liberty, in a very memorable moment, and laying waste to the Empire State building, the two most enduring symbols of New York.  Add to that the memory of the events of September 2001, and you have the sense that this story isn't going to end well.

There's a breakneck race through the streets and subways of Manhattan, and ever-longer peeks at the monster and its spawn, but there's never enough time to take it all in, never time to allow the mind to process exactly what it is that's happening, so the imagination takes over, which any old school horror aficionado will tell you is the most effective way to scare the bejeebers out of someone.  Let their mind do the work for you, let them imagine what is happening, what could happen, what will happen.

The casting of relative unknowns and the use of a near-real-time narrative are both critical to allowing the audience to put itself into the story.  I only saw one actor with whom I was familiar, and it did push me right out of the film for a moment because it suddenly registered as just a movie, an entertainment.  Until that moment I was very caught up in the narrative.  I know that when I'm sitting forward in my chair urging the characters to ""follow the rats, always follow the rats!"" that I've been quite properly hooked.

In the end, Cloverfield is really nothing more than a monster movie for the 21st century, but one which doesn't depend on blood and gore, or some lunatic with a butcher knife.  It's good fun.",1244419200,,2017,4.569444444444445

This reminds me so much of Lost where we don't know much about The Others, or the Dharma Initiative.  We are supposed to enjoy the ride not getting to the destination.

I am not going to say that Cloverfield is excellent film making, but it is an interesting film and quite honestly a fun movie if you let your self relax and enjoy it.  Don't take it too seriously, it is supposed to be fun!",1244246400,,793,4.025477707006369

At first blush, Cloverfield is a monster movie that affects the common, everyday people who happen to be having a going away party.  But it's more than that.

We are warned that this is video is property of the Department of Defense and is a recording found in a place formerly known as Central Park.  The story unfolds:

Robert Hawkins, Beth and his friends are video'ing the going away party and suddenly a large crash is heard.  They run out and find that the city around them is coming apart!  No one knows what's happening or going on and somehow, their social veneer comes apart.

A clumsy love story ensues partway through the film; we get somewhat enamored by the silly nerd who's running the camera so that ""people know"" what happened.

It's like an American Godzilla!

Yeah, on the surface, but what was Abrams trying to do with this film?

I think the director Matt Reeves is making a statement about the quick YouTube like generation.  Hey, let's get this on video and upload it to YouTube wow, gee!  Can't tell if that is a criticism of this generation's propensity for the internet or the lack of social skills presented.  The constant documentary style of the handy video cam and cell phone camera is more than a subtle commentary.

The plot rolls along nicely.  Little creatures peel of the main monster and make their home in the sewers of New York.  When they bite, somehow the victim eventually explodes.  This is never adequately explained, but the horror of losing your friend to this is not pretty -- a splatter on the tarmac is all you get!

The tension of the film surrounds not only saving Beth (the girl with a rebar impalement problem) but these kids are caught between the monster and the military, barely escaping with their lives.  And then not even that!

I understand the DVD has deleted scenes, a ""making of"" and a commentary by the director.

The criticism of the shaky camera and the Blair Witch Project is a minor annoyance.  What are the director and producer doing?  What are they trying to say?  This was a bold experiment by Abrams.  Yes, could' a been done better, but not a bad first effort.  Where's the sequel??

There is no film score, which makes sense since this is a civilian video.  And I will have to get the DVD now to catch the whisper at the end of the credits: ""Help Us, It's Still Alive!""

1585124,4,B00005JPXY,"I've watched this twice now and really came to appreciate it on the second viewing.  The first time through, I was a little bit on the ""what the hell was that?"" side.  But I watched it again, and found that I really enjoyed it the second time.

The realistic feel of ordinary people facing unimaginable circumstances really came through with the use of the whole ""handy cam"" shooting style.  However, I can totally understand how some might find this frenetic style difficult to watch, especially when most of us are used to traditional cinematography style of the static camera, close-up, wide shot, reaction shot with its many cuts between characters and straightforward storytelling style.  This, however, is undeniably messy, and for me, that's what makes it effective.  The very long, hand held shots must have been a marvel of choreography, and what cuts there are, are cleverly worked in and interwoven.

Good casting of some relative unknowns.  When we're introduced to the characters at the party, it's almost like some indy film about 20-something relationships in NY which could have been kind of interesting just as that, but it really sets characters.  These folks are not heroes, nor are they particularly smart or brave.  In short, they're ordinary.  But then this catastrophic event happens and pushes them into making decisions and choices that were inconceivable just earlier that day.  And while surviving the rampaging monster is the catalyst, it's the relationships that take the film forward.  In particular, the scene where Rob must tell his mother about Jason is well done.

For the most part, the effects are well done, and there are some great action sequences such as the race to get to the subway, and helicopter escape.  It's truly exciting and scary in places.  Great sound effects.  Are moments implausible?  Sure.  But hey, Monster attacks New York -- I willing to suspend my disbelief.

Sure Cloverfield sometimes defies belief--the main characters walk miles upon miles without ever fatiguing, it feels that they should eventually put down the camera, etc--but the film is skillfully made, the characters feel real (I was suprised to find that I cared about some of them) and the monster-movie aspects are done far better than any other film I can think of in recent years; it's a polarizing film but I think a good one.",1243209600,,452,4.794871794871795

It is all shot on a hand-held camera, with shakeycamera work and no music giving the feeling that your really watching a tape someone picked up in central park.

1585127,4,B00005JPXY,"When my wife and I first saw this film we emerged from the theater into the chill night feeling shell-shocked and drained.

Both of us had been blindsided by the experience, not having imagined, going in, how a film about a giant monster loose in Manhattan could possibly provide the basis for a truly thrilling or even remotely scary film experience. Well, boy were WE wrong.

I gather that a significant number of folks posting reviews here do not agree with me in this assesment. But, hey, that's why filmgoing is a subjective experience.

For me, the reason 'Cloverfield' is an instant classic, and a truly unique cinematic event, is because it throws out all the rules of conventional narrative -- yes, at the same time borrowing a few aspects from other films in the process -- and simply plunging the audience headlong, and often without explanation, into a nerve-jangling nightmare of apocolyptic proportions.

Spielberg, in many ways, set the scene, tonally speaking, with his more conventioanlly constructed 'War Of The Worlds' in 2005. That provided a template for how a microcosmic view of macrocosmic events -- often without the relative comfort of rational explanations -- could effectively pull the psychological rug out from under an audience, subjecting them to a primal, child-level fear of the unknown.

And now, building on Spielberg's earlier apocolyptic invasion by forces beyond our understanding or experience, director Matt Sherman and producer J.J. Abrams have created an even more nightmarish experience by entirely stripping away a conventional narrative approach and having the whole experience viewed through the unblinkingly harsh lens of a home-video camera.

This device has been previously -- and most famously -- used by the makers of 'The Blair Witch Project', and, subsequently, by the original makers AND re-makers of Rec./Quarantine. And, in each case, this was a very effective choice, absolutely intrinsic to the impact of the narrative and to its feel of queazy immediacy.

But only in the case of 'Cloverfield' has this intimate and claustrophobic device been applied to the telling of truly EPIC events. And that was 'Cloverfield's creative masterstroke.

Of course, the ultimate blue-print for this approach was first introduced to the world in the many indelible home-video images of 9/11 and its aftermath. Never before had the world witnessed such monumental destruction in such an intimate and immediate way -- personal hand-held video-diaries of Armageddon.

And, because of the utilization of this narrative device, coupled with the related removal of any musical score, the audience is thus removed from its typical movie ""comfort zone"" and subjected to a much more raw experience -- a million miles away from anything so quaint and comforting as giant monsters destroying Tokyo.

In one fell swoop kid-stuff becomes vid-snuff!

And my hat is off to the entire creative team on this one for creating the most believable CGI world I've ever seen. Believable because ""invisible"" in the sense of not drawing attention to its own existence.

Even in the brilliant realization of the creature itself, the wise decision of not letting the audience get too protracted or clear a look was crucial to the overall feeling of nightmarish reality the filmmakers were going for.

And they succeeded in spades, even if the resulting experience was too jarring, offputting, and uncomfortable to translate into massive box-office blockbuster status.

Folks, this is simply NOT your Dad's monster movie.

Nope.

'Cloverfield' is a whole new animal.",1242864000,,3583,5.2377622377622375

The biggest strength for the movie was the whole camcorder viewpoint thing and it's also what makes it such a pain to watch.  It's shaky, you'll end up looking at peoples' shoes, and the guy holding it comes off as a buffoon.  He gives his stupid little comments through the whole movie.  The monster is big and weird-looking enough, but there's no reason given.  Just shows up and starts knocking over buildings.  Even at the (subpar) finale, theres no insight given, no direction.

The characters aren't interesting, they're all just the same yahoos.  And the first twenty or so minutes of the movie are you being forced to watch a bunch of teen drama coming from twenty-somethings that's supposed to show some insight into the people you're supposed to care about, but it fails and is just boring.

I see people, who thought this movie was an accurate portrayal of behavior that you'd see during an apocalyptic-type disaster -- seriously?! I didn't see any footage, hear, or read any stories of people acting this mentally challenged during 9/11. Let's hope that during such a disaster, real people won't demonstrate Darwin's theory in action by showing how the unfit remove themselves from the gene pool. The movie is full of unknown actors for a reason. The first third to half of the movie is a pathetic attempt to build suspense by wasting time with the irrelevant drama of the dating lives of a bunch of 20-somethings at a not-remotely believable ""going away party"" -- unrequited lust, ambivalence, love triangles, childhood sweethearts, no character depth, no one at all to care about in this low-budget sad excuse for a horror flick, and no suspense or thrill whatsoever.

""Something terrible. Don't look at it.""  ""What was that??""  ""Also, something terrible. Don't look at that, either,"" make you wish the whole cast had met their distrastrous fate 70 minutes earlier, if not sooner. Not scary. Not funny. 84 minutes we'll never get back.

Just in case you were sleeping and didn't notice, I gave this movie five stars.  Yep, that's right; I gave `Cloverfield' an A.  I know what you are thinking.  `He's crazy.'  Maybe I am, but the truth of the matter is (and I've stated I rate each film according to genre as well as overall entertainment and artistic value) that for the type of film `Cloverfield' is, and for the type of film it makes claim to be, there really isn't much more you could ask from it.

I mean, honestly; what isn't right about this picture?

The film is crazy suspenseful, action packed, gripping, witty, enthralling, memorable; I mean I can't think of a single thing that I would have changed.  The script may be a little cookie cutter but the execution is fresh and intriguing and adds layers that aren't there on paper.  Visually it is superb, using the very underused `less is more' tactic in order to create true suspense and fear; and when it does insert CGI in order to give us some brief glimpses of this `creature' in order to validate our fear it is top notch.  Casting a group of unknowns adds to the feeling of reality that sets in, which only increases the fear.

I mean, really; watch this movie in the dark and tell me you weren't pulling your feet up on the couch and checking behind you at every creak in your house.

The concept is simple; a group of friends get together to wish one of their own a bon voyage when the city is attacked by some creature and they are scattered.  They travel together with a handheld camera through the city to rescue a friend who is injured and wind up documenting something unbelievable.

A little side note for those of you who have either complained about the shaky camcorder style filming or are biting at the bit to do so; DON'T.  Listen, I understand you don't want to get sick or whatever, but the camcorder filming is the whole point of this movie.  If you know that that type of filming doesn't bode well with you then don't bother watching this movie.  Seriously, to complain about a directorial choice that is more than explained to you in the trailer for the film and that serves as the whole foundation for the film is rather ridiculous.  This movie, stripped of that shaky frame, would not be the same film.  It is meant to pull you in to the action and make you feel a part of it, and it does that very thing.

Anyways.

I admit, this isn't a thought provoking drama or a brooding character study, but it isn't trying to be.  Sure, sci-fi or even horror films are allowed to stray into deeper territories and I encourage that wholeheartedly, but for a film that claims to be nothing more than a sci-fi thriller I can't fault it a thing.

The unadulterated Japanese cut of the film, which has only been released in the west relatively recently, is a stark warning against the misuse of Atomic energy released in a country that less than a decade before had suffered its defining moment of the twentieth century at the hands of the Atom bomb. At the time of its release, the first generation of 'Hibakusha'  were still suffering the direct effects of the atrocities committed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the scenes of municipal halls crammed to capacity with people suffering radiation sickness, the wholesale destruction of Tokyo, and the unforgettable scene of a nation mourning its loss through a choral radio broadcast would've struck a deeply horrific, resonant chord with the Japanese audience of its time. Time and the Toho company's lucrative franchise have almost completely eroded the original power and intent of the film from history and replaced it with a farrago of sequels featuring increasingly outlandish monsters duking it out in badly realised model cities. Considering this, I'd argue that 'Cloverfield'  is probably the only true spiritual sequel to Ishiro Honda's film ever made in that it uses more or less the same concept to similarly examine a defining moment of national history and evoke the horrors of a collective international tragedy and its aftermath. In this case, that moment is the 911 attacks and the nation is America and, by association and the proliferation of more technologically advanced broadcast technologies, the world. 911 haunts every frame of the film. When one observes the shaky hand-held vistas of ash-covered New Yorkers hiding in grocery stores to avoid the billowing detritus of falling buildings, one can't help but relate it to the footage captured by the French film-makers, the Naudet bros. in the haunting documentary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-The-Filmmakers-Commemorative-Edition/dp/B00006B1HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition</a>. There have been a lot of questions asked around the subject of whether it was tasteful or indeed right to frame a ""monster movie"" in a verite style which mimics video footage of a national tragedy. To those people I would say, ""you're missing the point"". While nominally a monster movie in appearance, 'Cloverfield' is really no more about a giant undersea arthropod than 'Gojira' was about a giant lizard; both are merely cyphers for forces in our daily lives which could run out of control and devastate our world and both are filmed in a style which is evocative and relevant to the audiences of their time. The creatures of both stories are barely seen - a stylistic choice which suggests that one should not attach too much importance to the cause but rather the effects. The reasons behind the destruction in Cloverfield remain nebulous and unresolved and as the final haunting frames of the film draw to the close, it is ultimately the human cost of the destruction that the audience is left to consider rather than the origins of its agent.",1235174400,2,3732,5.698384201077199

However things go from good to really bad in the blink of an eye.  Much like the Blair Witch the character is running with his video camera and the movie is shown thru his camera.  This causes several jerky scenes and I thought I would have a siezure.

All in all the movie was not beliveable, the movie was not very realistic (ok a monster attacking is not realistic to start with), who video tapes themself running for their lives?",1234742400,3,889,4.275449101796407
1585222,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield was an immense disappointment for me.  It lacked the campy, almost naive goofiness of the Japanese Godzilla/monster movies that made them so fun, but lacked the intelligence to serve as a metaphor for the potential and actual disaster that face a modern society (could we through in any more allusions to 9/11 in 1 film?!).

This film is told from the first person perspective (by showing the story through the lens of a handheld camera).  Unfortunately, this narrative technique greatly reduces the scope of the film to a small slice of a gigantic event.  It's like being served a pepperoni instead of the pizza.  I think War of the Worlds, to a certain degree, also suffered many of the same problems that Cloverfield suffers.  What is the point of a monster movie, except to see mayhem on a massive scale: gigantic monsters; loving shots of modern weapondry in action; large crowds of people squished underfoot.  Instead, we get a jittery, limited view of some potential coolness, and get left with the feeling that ridiculous New York film school technique prevailed over giving the audience what they want.

The appealingness of focusing only on a few people in a Godzilla style movie rests solely on how interesting those few people are.  What do we get?  Four or five annoying twenty/thirty somethings who we already learn to hate after having to watch them whine, bitch, and connive about their lame personal lives for twenty minutes.  I forget the name of the character who holds the camera throughout most of the movie, but I actually clapped and cheered when the monster eats him at the end because he was so impossibly annoying.  With buildings blowing up and collapsing, breaking news casts, and people covered in soot and dust, Cloverfield clumsily tries to equate the situation of these 5 losers to New Yorkers during the 9/11 attacks.  I won't launch into a long diatrab about it - suffice it to say that this attempt to evoke the terror and confused of 9/11 utterly fails for a varity of reasons.

There are a few things that are good about Cloverfield.  Special effects are done well (though the design of the monster is absolutely pathetic in my opinion), and there is some decent scenes of destruction and mayhem.  Other then that, the only reason to watch this movie is to cheer when the camera man gets eaten at the end.",1234656000,,2354,4.775308641975308

Best appreciated on a good home theatre setup with lots of subwoofer capability,  the style of the movie nonetheless holds up well in a more modest setup.

It begins where everyone is having a great party time before Mr. Monster strikes and you hope maybe it will start  going somewhere w/ subtle (or not so subtle) suggestion or hints that something is about to explode. Well the movie itself is in fact a bomb and the explosive hell that finally (and all too late) breaks loose comes across with no impact other then the thought, ""where's the beef"". As others commented negatively, the all too free camera style (shaky, you-are-right-there) has been used far more effectively and creatively in the Jason Borne Movies (the first movie series to really utilize this free style -as some are trying to copy now- ,but, do it so well and with less shake in the process). I rented this movie for $1.99 at the local video rental store (seems perhaps they were trying to get some ROI back on this due to low rentals?) Well, that was about $1.98 too much spent to watch it, but, glad I didn't buy this DVD!  In checking how much revenue this movie brought in; The film has grossed $30,341,830 in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $200,944,148.

 The reason why I saw a half a time was because when I went to see it in theater, I made the mistake of getting popcorn. I didn't make it through the first half hour of the movie before I had to run to the RR and THROW UP.

 The camera movement on this movie was HORRIBLE. And I'm not one to get sick easy- the Blair Witch project didn't give me any trouble. I didn't expect this one too, either, but it did.

 But the whole Godzilla twist deal, coupled with the previews of the havoc being laid apon New York, well. I was intruiged enough to give it another shot. I rented it and took it home.

Man, what a disappointer. This is my first negative movie rating, and it's well earned. Not only was the camera shaking still a major bother, but still managed to make me sick, even while I was watching it on my portable! On top of that, the ending of this movie was just atrocious. No resolution to the plot at all, it just leaves you hanging. Like the sopranos and the frakin' cut to black crap.  Hasn't anyone told these film makers the only people whose allowed to get away with that is M. Night and Stephen King? Theres a reason why people hate these endings. Your doin' it RONG!

-spoiler warning-

 The only upside to this movie was the awesome scene where the monster comes up and whacks the helicopter out of the sky. I was praying for the monsters victory if only so the characters would DIE and end my stomach nausea.

1585302,2,B00005JPXY,"Here is the thing about this movie, it was billed and marketed as a monster movie.  All the  hype built up around the movie was on wondering what type of monster it would be, whether it was a new Godzilla film or some alien invasion, the point conveyed through marketing was that it was a monster movie.  Two things contradicted this though.

1. Let me say that I get suspense, I understand a need for a build up, but to have maybe the last 10 minutes of an hour and a half film show the monster that, and remember this was the primary reason many went to go see this film, was a definite rip-off.  Which leads me to #2

2. This movie is not, and there cannot be enough emphasis on the words is not, a monster movie in the traditonal sense.  This movie is about the people involved in a disaster created by the monster, for the purpose of this movie you could have replaced the monster with a fire, a meteor, an earthquake, or the Stay Puft man, the point is that the creature is just background, the focus of this movie are the kids.

Now some of you may be saying that there isn't aything wrong with that, that the idea sounds interesting, and thats fine, just remember though, it wasn't marketed as that, it was marketed as a monster movie.  if there is one thing I can't stand its a lie and thats what this was, a lie to get the public interested and then a delivery of not only a completely different movie, but a sub-par one at that.",1232064000,3,1439,4.203636363636364

I mean come on a camera that has a batteriy that can last an entire night and that can servive several drops and being chewed up and dropped out of the monsters mouth. I would love a camera that tuff. To bad non exist. And as for the military in the movie, maybe its just the fact that having served in the military that i critisize movies different then civilains do because i have knowledge of weapons, tactics, and capabilitys. This was by far the worst movie with the military in it. Even worse then starship troopers 2! Also the acting was poor and there was no plot to it, no background. I was half expecting, half hoping Godzilla would jumpout from behind a building and kill this monster. When the movie was over and everyone was leaving we all complained about it as we passed everyone waiting in line to buy tickets and we ended up taking over half the line away!

The Blu-ray video transfer was not very good, but the audio was fantastic.  Great effects from the rear channels.

The best thing about this film are the CGI effects and the well-designed creatures.  Hats off to their designer.  Too bad, the director ruined the movie filming it in this fashion, as this was possibly the best giant monster-creature I have ever seen.

I just couldn't understand how we could have such extremely opposite reactions, but now that time has passed, I realize that this is just one of those movies that people either love or hate. There is very little middle ground (as reflected in the reviews).

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that sometimes the 'cameraman' is obviously doing things that are for an interesting shot instead of how an actual person would act. This is supposed to be 'found footage,' and shots like that really draw you out of the experience. The most obvious example of this is when our heroes are making their way across the roof of a building that has semi-collapsed into another building. In a real situation like that, either the camera would be off, or the person holding it would be occasionally using that hand to grab hold and steady himself, resulting in random shots of the roof, his feet, his stomach, etc. Instead, we are treated to a nice, bird's eye view of the monster rampaging in the distance, with just a few shaky movements to indicate that this is all happening on a hand-held camera.

Moments like these are few and far between though, so it isn't difficult to recommend this movie to all of my friends.",1231545600,,1366,4.594262295081967

1585357,4,B00005JPXY,"For a catastrophic event movie, it is unique in that it restricts the perspective of events to the limited knowledge, perspective and insight of a (seemingly) randomly selected point of view.  The sense of photo-realism is unique with the filming style (personal video unit perspective) but the behavior acting is not very realistic.  The acting is subordinate to the suspense plot. Special effects inject a setting of compelling surrealism.

The compelling question in the acting drama is whether in extreme psychological situations the mind would choose irrational paths.  For example, since the video perspective is supposed to be an amateur eyewitness video log, what would compel a person to forgo natural and instinctive tendencies to self preservation and film events of such horrific personal and familiar devastation.  On the surface, it seems ridiculous.  Perhaps an exercise to rationalize it is overreaching.

The characters are steered through a world destined to showcase their personal faults while snaring them in a constant life and death struggle.  It is, however, difficult to read any larger point or purpose into the unfolding of the drama than the rescue plot points.

The gaps in story are provoking to the imagination.  Information is withheld the viewer as to causes and reasons.  If a person cares enough, it's a puzzle.  If they don't, it's a joke.

The devastation theme is almost textbook catastrophe horror.  The plot is action based and as an action movie it is ""dizzily"" intense.  In such stories there is not as much need or cause for dramatic showcasing.  Truly an action adventure.  What else would you expect?",1230768000,2,1645,5.170454545454546

I think it might have enjoyed this 'queasy cam' flick more than I might of, because I kept busting out laughing at the most inappropriate moments (whenever another of the hapless party goers bit it) thinking of Stan's dad repeatedly saying ""I'm so startled!"" while shooting film of the 'monsters' destroying South Park.

Cloverfield has an interesting premise, and provides a unique take on the 'Godzilla' variant of monster movies. Many singing its praises reference its uniqueness as if unique things are inherently good because they are uncommon. I disagree completely. For a 'unique' film to also be a quality film, it needs to provide something VALUABLE that is lacking from more traditional presentations. While home video style hand cam footage does put the viewer right in the thick of things, I don't believe it actually does much to help tell the story more convincingly. A film (or any story for that matter) will always succeed or fail because of its characters, plot, and dialogue. A gimmicky shooting style may create a new ""look"" but it will not make a bad film into a good one.

Cloverfield suffers more from story telling problems than anything else. It is hard to really engage with the characters, even though the first third of the film is devoted to sorting out their love lives. In my opinion, it would have been much better to simply start the movie at the point where the monster begins to attack the city and leave the audience to feel the panic of the faceless masses, and then introduce the characters as the story develops.

Novelty can only take a film so far. To really be successful, it must do more than just provide an interesting gimmick. Cloverfield is just another hum-drum monster movie, shot with an admittedly unique(if sickening) shooting technique. 2.5/5 stars.",1230336000,5,1890,4.9

If you are someone who thinks the most important criteria for a film is that the camera is stable, then this movie is not for you. There is no point in even reviewing Cloverfield if you are one of these people. Stop spamming this film with one stars and get over it! I don't like romantic comedies. So you know what I do about it? I don't watch them. No need to watch one after another in hopes that my mind will someday change.

If you are like me then you know that to give any critique of this film's plot or of its actors is to completely miss the point of the entire movie. Films like this are not about making a cookie cutter film. They are about one thing and one thing only. ""The Ride"".

The goal of a film like Cloverfield is to immerse the viewer into a unrealistic scenario as if it were real. It's fun to be chased by monsters. That's IT! Being chased by monsters is fun. That's the film. If you weren't such an elitist snob maybe you could indulge in such simple pleasures. It's your loss though. Cloverfield is a GREAT ride. I enjoyed every minute of it.

Reminds one of party-hardy types who need to drink in order to be social and obnoxious at the same time (we've all been around these type idiots).

Again, very amateurish filming and directing of airhead yuppie college half-wits. After the first 12 minutes of the film, you really want the ""Monster"" (and its little babies) to start wiping out these useless denizens of endless partying. Well, in a fun sort of way. The only tension in the movie is watching these kids partying, and conversing in the usual tripe one engages in with a bunch of drunks. Who by the way, miraculously sober up when the monsters attack (or maybe not).

The release of tension from watching these social drunkards is relieved once the loveable monsters begin their mayhem of the city. Of course, the real worth of these ""ne're do wells"" in panic and disaster situations is revealed by their absolutely stupified reactions to imminent death. Rob! Rob! ..... Hud! Hud! .....Oh my God! Oh God! ......Hey Dude!

Laughingly entertaining. Not scary at all. At 27 minutes into the movie, you'll be chuckling. At 60 minutes, really laughing!  At 70 minutes, you'll be rooting for the monsters!  At 73 mins, 34 secs. your pain will subside. Documentary over. ""It's a wrap!""",1229644800,2,1573,4.943181818181818

At one stage, the monster puts a lampshade on its head and stands very still, and the heroes walk right past it without seeing it! No, hold on, that's Scooby Doo. The principle is sound though.

Seriously, the film is tense, I didn't find the handheld off-putting but as a dramatic tool, and it prevented us from seeing much of a back-story. I wanted to know what the monsters motivation was. I understand that a possible sequel will attempt to tell the monsters side of the story though. No, really. I have to say, I prefer the more traditional monster film with the army blatting away at the monster, and the monster is chucking tanks around and swatting planes.

I think the film is full of high suspense, edge of your seat fun. The trailer image of the head of the statue of liberty coming off is sure to go down in movie history. The production is done from the point of view of a camcorder that one of the party members has. So the entire film is done in first person POV. I found this really interesting and fun but the rollercoaster effect might not be pleasurable for all but aside from that possible weakness, this film is sheer monster madness. The film makers are having a bunch of fun having people running scared as this massive fiend rips buildings apart and shakes the ground, pounds the army and gets it back just as rough. It is like one big extended action sequence throughout its whole running time. If you like this sort of thing, then go for it. I think it tends to be the type of film that some people like a lot or not at all.

1585440,2,B00005JPXY,"What could have turned out to be one of the best giant monster films of recent years, turns out to be a very frustrating movie experience. OK, I totally get what the producers of this film were trying to do with the mock video style of the film. Unfortunately, it doesn't work most of the time. Some situations were completely contrived and didn't feel true at all. This totally goes against what the filmmakers were trying to conceive.

The biggest problem with trying to make this look like it's really happening is.... we know it's fake! No matter what you do with or what camera you use, it's never going to be taken as real, So why not make the same movie only with good actors and using real cameras? The idea is good enough to stand up to a traditional style of film making. The image stabilization is really trying at times and really becomes more of a distraction rather than a useful tool. It would have been better to make the film in  normal process and switch to the video style in segments, like when a news cameraman is filming real news. It would have saved everyone a headache and we would get that down in the thick of it feeling that worked in this film.
I did enjoy this movie, but I was equally frustrated, because I think they really missed a great opportunity to make a fantastic monster film!

1585441,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is a tragic love story. It begins with two lovers together and ends the same way. The first part of the plot is about giant alien destroying a city, but the subplot is about our hero trying to get to his heroine and save her.

The movie starts with our hero, Rob waking up after spending a night with his friend Beth. Rob and Beth were friends but they finally have become lovers. The day is beautiful and these two are so happy. They even spend the day together at Coney Island. Fast forward to a month later. Rob has found a job in Japan and will be leaving to go work there. His brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily are throwing a goodbye party for Rob. Originally Jason was supposed to videotape the event, but he gives that responsibility to Jason's best friend Hud. Hud in turn has a bad crush on Lily's friend Marlena. Rob is surprised and a bit sad because this will be his last night in NYC and with that he must leave Beth behind. Something has happened in the past month because Rob and Beth are not talking. She comes to the party, they fight and she leaves.

And this is where the story really begins. The alien monster comes along and begins to destroy everything in its path. Rob, Jason, Lily, Marlena and Hud all try to run and find safety in Brooklyn. They are almost home free when Rob gets a call from Beth. She is hurt, scared and maybe dying. Rob has a decision to make, either continue with his friends to freedom or go into the alien war zone and save the love of his life.

Rob quickly decides he must go back and find Beth, regardless of the fact that he may die or that Beth could already be dead. Now I was thinking what is wrong with this guy?? In the immortal words of Monty Python- ""RUN AWAY!!"" But the simple fact is, what if it was your true love or if you were a parent and your child called you asking for help? Rob makes the decision and heads to Beth. Because Rob goes, Lily follows and because Marlena is good friends with Lily, she goes also and then there is Hud who because he is such good friends with Rob, will also come along and help his friend. (As for Jason, well Jason doesn't come). These four are now warriors going into a war zone where they may not come out alive. And this is where I realized the underlying story of this sci-fi movie is in essence a love story.

We have a love story between Rob and Beth. We have a true love and friendship with Rob and his friend Hud and of course Lily who is good friends with Marlena. But this is a tragic love story so you probably can guess that some of these people won't survive. But what I can tell you is that our two lovers, Rob and Beth are reunited and end up together much like they way they were at the beginning of the movie. As they declare their love (which they never have said) for each others there is a possibility they may not survive.

This is the type of love that we read in our romances, where the hero will die trying to get to his one true love and save her. And when the hero and heroine believe they maybe separated forever, that is when all feelings come to the surface and they passionately say ""I love you"". And honestly, that has to be the perfect way to go.

Cloverfield, a love story? Who would have thought it?

1585496,4,B00005JPXY,"Introduction: The very first impression Cloverfield is bound to give many viewers, is a return of Roland Emmerich's 1998 adaption of Toho's Iconic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;or maybe even a run of the mill teen-horror film, due to the youth of its actors and actresses your won't recognize unless you've watched certain television shows or movies. Better yet, if your fan of ABC's long running series LOST and you know who the producer is, then you bound to believe that its connected to the series itself. That said, I was among the many who caught the teaser trailer when it premiered in theaters the three days after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRANSFORMERS/dp/B00005JPNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRANSFORMERS</a>&nbsp;was released July 3d 2007. I thought it was sequel to Godzilla. However, the only thing Cloverfield has in common with anything mentioned above is that its produced by J.J. Abrams and is, more or less, a homage to Giant Monster movies of old. Because lets face it, monster movies are made as often as westerns are now-a-days if you don't include the latter's small revival this and last year.

Plot: Filmed in the style of a home movie, Cloverfield begins on the day of April 27th. Rob Hawkins (Michael-Stahl David) and Beth (Odette Yustman) McIntyre are awakening from a night spent in her father's apartment in the Time Warner Center. On the spur of the moment, Rob decides to take Beth to Coney Island. The video then fast-forwards to May 22nd. Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) and Jason Hawkins (Mike Vogel) are preparing a farewell party for Jason's brother, Rob, who is departing for Japan after being promoted to vice-president of a Japanese company he works for. Originally burdened with job of recording testimonials (farewell) messages for Rob, Jason carts the job off to his brother's friend, Hud Platt (J.T. Miller), who reluctantly agrees to take the job with the promise of his long-time crush, Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan), coming to the party at the behest of Lily. When Rob and his best friend, Beth McIntyre arrive to party, the film reveals that Rob has slept with Beth and thus created a rift between them, by shunning her (so to speak). Jason and Hud go to ""comfort"" Rob about the situation, but their attempt to console him is suddenly interrupted by a mysterious earthquake. When the group travels to the roof to inspect the situation, they are caught off guard by an explosion that sends flaming debris down on them and the statue of liberty's head rolling into the streets of New York shortly thereafter. The group attempts to leave the city via the Brooklyn Bridge, but the bridge is attacked by a hulking creature of a indescribable nature. Against the pleads of his friends, (who eventually decide to follow him), Rob decides to go after Beth after receiving a distressed phone call from her despite the danger lurking inside the city.

Overview: The storyline for Cloverfield is simplistic and straight forward; The beginning, specifically plays out like an episode of TheWB's Felicity (a tale of troubled relationships, romantic advice, and unrequited crushes). It never tries to dazzle you with an explanation to the events occurring in the film. Its told completely from the point of view of the civilian, thus there's no suitable explanation beyond the speculation of the characters. I think this is one of the things that works to the film's advantage. The lack of explaning as to what's happening keeps the film from being bogged down by the disbelief that most Monster movies are regarded with. If you didn't follow the movie's then-contagious Viral Marketing Campaign, then you'll may or may not be confused on some points. The atmosphere that surrounds the film is, at first a welcome lure of security and complacent within itself. Quite honestly the first half hour will have you wondering why you bothered to watch Cloverfield in the first place. Rest assured, once the main event begins, it will catch the viewer off guard --- destroying the security the film established in the beginning. Confusion and fear will be your companion and the lack of explanation only intensifies an already frightening situation.

Directed by Matt Reeves (writer/director for The Pallbearer (1996), and TheWB's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Felicity/dp/B00005JLJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Felicity</a>), Cloverfield moves fast and hard once it gets started, but is severely lagged down by its half hour introduction of the main players of the central storyline, which I think words to advantage in some ways. Without it, you really wouldn't couldn't care whether or not the characters, already established in their personalities and lives, would live or die. (Depending on the person.) Which begs the question as to why it wasn't just a half-hour longer. Nevertheless, Reeves' straightforward direction works to the movie's advantage. As mentioned a dozen times before, Cloverfield is filmed and performed to something akin to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project-1999/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">[The] Blair Witch Project (1999)</a>, utilizing the amateurish camera work and crooked camera angles. However its quality its on par with that of the general motion picture image. Clear, mostly unfuzzy and not so frenetic or sloppy.

The Visual/Special effects implemented in the film by Double Negative (Batman Begins, Shaun of the Dead) and Tippett Studio (Consantine, The Spiderwick Chronicles) are fantastic. While there are obvious moments where the FX is plainly obvious, they managed to make their CGI blend in near-seamlessly with the real world environment of ""New York City"". The creatures (designed by Neville Page) themselves, the centerpiece of the film, are amazing. The photo-realism of their appearance are brilliantly crafted and the greatest achievement in the movie overall. One notable aspect of Cloverfield is the lack of an Orchestral Score. The closest to a soundtrack that this film has is several pieces of popular pop/rock singles played in the background of the farewell party in the beginning. The only actual score featured in the film is the ""ROAR! (Cloverfield Overture)"" by Michael Giacchino (LOST, Speed Racer), a powerful and romantic orchestrated theme that serves as a nod to the late Akira Ifukube's Godzilla (Gojira) Theme of 1950's without sounding terribly like it.

When concerned with the performances from the actors in the movie, I half expected them to be the weakest part of the film. While it may take a second viewing to fully appreciate the acting, I was pleasantly surprised by how well everyone did in this film. This group of little known actors, consist of the likes of Jessica Lucas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-as-we-Know-it/dp/B0009F43DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life as we Know it</a>, CSI, The Covenant), Lizzy Caplan (CBS' The Class, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mean-Girls/dp/B0002IQJ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mean Girls</a>), Mike Vogel (Poseidon, Grounded for Life, 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B00018D44K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>&nbsp;[Remake]), Michael Stahl-David (NBC's terribly irsh-ganster-cliched The Black Donnellys), stand-up comedian T.J. Miller (ABC's Carpoolers) and Odette Yustman (UPN's South Beach, and ABC's October Road). All of which give way-above ""average"" performances in their respective character roles. What will be held against them of course (besides being worthy of being Magazine Ad models) is the fact that most of their performances consist of sobbing, running and screaming at the monster lurking in the dark. But even when their doing this, their performances come off as believable and natural. Something I appreciated in the aforementioned TV series, Felicity.

The natural performances from the large cast of actors; The ability to come off as genuine while in the guise of their characters for four long seasons. This sort of acting translates excellently in the film. The actors many have been charmed by, is the semi-recognizable Lizzy Caplan (arguably the only vetran-character actor, first to Mike Vogel) and T.J. Miller; Their chemistry, comedic chops, and rapport on-screen pays off in more ways than one, most likely due to the heavy use of improvising. Performances I was particularly concerned with were the ones coming from Jessica Lucas and Mike Vogel, both of which have starred in movies where I never paid too much attention to them in. Jessica Lucas, more than proves that she is worthy of becoming of a brilliant actress with her under appreciated performance as Lily Ford. While Mike Vogel, as usual, is far too convincing in the role as the laid back and rather lazy older brother of Rob Hawkins, Jason; a man who hands out ""wiser-than-you-should be"" advice to his troubled younger sibling. Its one of his better performances despite his lack of screen-time, certainly not one to be ignored. And before I forget, Michael Stahl-David and Odette Yustman (the focal characters of the film), give great performances as estranged friends (or lovers) struggling to reconcile their differences in the middle of an unexpected disaster.

Overall, Cloverfield is an excellent film that falls into the ""love it or hate it"" category. Its certainly not for anyone looking for an straight-forward monster-movie in the way of Godzilla and King Kong, especially if your think of it as an ""Gimmick(y)"" sort of film. For me, all the elements utilized in Cloverfield fell into place and left quite the lasting impression on my memory. My biggest problem with the film, falls down to its length. Once you realize how short it is, you'll wish it was longer. And with the word of mouth already spread about the general public about this film, in the end, your enjoyment of Cloverfield will probably come down to your ability to suspend your disbelief and how well you can stand a film not filmed in the proper motion picture style. A highly recommended movie.  --- [4 out of 5].",1226016000,4,10416,5.604695431472082

1585501,3,B00005JPXY,"If you've seen Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" you've seen the stereotypical Hollywood pitch - ""It's 'Deliverance' meets 'Ordinary People' meets 'Marathon Man,' but it's got a heart.""  Movies are defined by how they reference other movies - that's how they get sold in today's bottom-line driven, play-it-safe Hollywood culture.

""Cloverfield"" was easily pitched as ""It's 'Blair Witch' meets 'Godzilla' meets 'Aliens' meets 'Friends,' with a paean to 9/11 thrown in.""  Adopting the same fiction of ""BW"" - that we've found the videotape capturing horrific yet mostly unseen events happening to real people - ""Cloverfield"" tells the thankfully-terrifying tale of a gargantuan monster tearing apart Manhattan.

Unfortunately, while we cared about Heather, Josh and Mike to some degree in ""BW,"" we really can't muster up any empathy for the cadre of uber-hip twenty-somethings ""Cloverfield"" throws us into.  These are obviously people who dress according to magazine covers and have memorized the cliched roles from ""Friends.""  There's a Ross-Rachel love story going on involving two leads, while the guy's brother and best friend throw him a going-away party that the best friend videotapes.  This follows the tired cliche of everyone on the tape talking about the lovers' ""secret undying love for each other.""  The guy is even going to Japan, for God's sake, just like Ross did in a plot contrivance to keep the Ross-Rachel story ""interesting"" for another bloated season.

This tripe occupies the first fifteen minutes, and then thankfully the monster shows up.  The movie's handling of the monster is its greatest strength, as the monster is shown in terrifying glimpses and quick shots.  This thing is a behemoth, destroying the Brooklyn Bridge with an accidental swipe of its tail.  Perhaps more terrifying, it drops space-lice from its skin that are miniature demons straight out of ""Starship Troopers"" crossed with the baddies from ""Aliens.""  This is scary stuff.

The story follows our intrepid band of twits as they try to first escape Manhattan and then to save the girlfriend, Beth.  Manhattan is destroyed, convincingly, by both the monster and the U.S. Army.  The movie never really explains what's going on, and this leads to several truly terrifying and shocking moments I won't spoil here.  But this part of the movie is what ""Godzilla"" should have been.

Unfortunately, the videotape of the carnage is recorded over the lovers' tryst, so we get perfectly-timed snippets of their relationship-bliss intercut with the action.  If we cared about these two, I suppose it would rise to powerful stuff a la ""Titanic,"" but since we don't, the love story is an annoying distraction.

Much has been made of the jerky handicam style of the movie.  I saw it on DVD, so the TV screen was probably more merciful than a full size movie screen.  But I think those who are nauseated by the jerkiness of the camera are reflecting their distaste for the characters.  After all, when Steven Spielberg went all herky-jerky with the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" it was hailed as a high-water mark of filmmaking. There's a great difference between watching the storming of Normandy than there is watching the lives of twits being rent asunder, colossal monster or no colossal monster.",1225238400,,3285,5.145009416195857

3 - I guess I'm not allowed to share spoilers, so let me just say, the plot (besides the ""Giant Monster in Manhattan"" bit) is just awful and I'll leave it at that.

Good points:
The held held camera view was very effective in places and did give you a sense of the panic that can occur in disaster situations. The acting was decent and as already mentioned the special effects were well done.

Bad points:
The opening party sequence went on too long. All it was trying to tell us was that a couple had split up and that could have been done much quicker. After 10 minutes had gone by, in what is a short movie, I was beginning to wonder if I was watching the right film...
I accept that you have to suspend disbelief when watching films like this, but this had so many occasions when what happened lacked any credibility in reality (I'm talking about the Helicopter crash and the girl who was impaled on the steel pole to name two examples). I also got fed up with hearing people saying ""oh my God"" every 30 seconds. The hand-held camera use needed to be broken up. 84 mins was too long for a wobbly picture....

Having said all that it is worth seeing, as after the slow start its certainly an entertaining rollercoaster ride. But like I said at the start this is essentially a B Movie/Monster Movie, if you expect nothing else than you'll probably enjoy a fun movie. Expect any more and you might be disappointed",1222819200,,1488,4.483394833948339
1585559,2,B00005JPXY,"While this film has a lot to recommend it, it is a disappointment overall. I liked the idea of a video record of an attack by a monster from the viewpoint of one person's camcorder. The performances in the film are good and the special effects are very well done. However, the overall effect never really gets you involved with the story. The monster is only seen in quick glimpses untill the very end of the film. There is no clear resolution to the film's story, other than you know that there is a military attack on the monster and that the camcorder was found later on. (Spoiler alert) You only know that most of the characters that you are watching die, one in a very gruesome way.
The films concept was a good one, I thought, but if you're going to see NYC trashed by a monster, get the remake of Godzilla. It's not a great film, but at least it doesn't take itself too seriously and has some fun to it. This film is a major downer and doesn't really hold together.",1222646400,,972,4.288043478260869
1585560,4,B00005JPXY,"The elevator pitch for this movie is Godzilla in Manhattan, with a different monster.  And that's what you get in Cloverfield, a well-done low-budget movie that shows you don't need $100 million to make a decent movie.  A group of friends at a going-away party, with a video camera, are in Manhattan when a monster shows up.  Part of the genius of Cloverfield is that we don't know where the monster came from, what it's doing or what it wants.  Every other movie of this genre is from the POV of the science guy who figures out how to fight the monster, whether with ""plain ol' sodium!"" (""Horror of Party Beach""), some kind of radio waves, (""Beginning of the End,"" as I recall), or by nuking the site to make sure.  In ""Cloverfield,"" the POV instead is that of the schmucks like us who would be running around wondering what the heck is going on after we find the head of the Statue of Liberty out in the street in front of the house.

On the downside, there's a little too much pre-monster time in the movie.  And the video camera is magical - it has enough battery life to run through an entire party and a monster attack, with some left over to run the external light and Night Shot.  Where do I get one of those?  What's funny as well is that Cloverfield is supposed to look like it's shot on home video - so Blu-Ray is a little bit of overkill here.

But at 90 minutes, Cloverfield keeps moving fast enough so you don't think about the holes, and the movie doesn't outstay its welcome.  It's at least worth a rent.",1222646400,3,1520,4.316901408450704

Look for star turns by That Girl Who Was in Mean Girls and That One Dude Who Played Eric in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

1585562,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is more than a mediocre monster film. It is actually pretty darn good. Not great, but entertaining enough at 84 minutes to keep you interested from beginning to unconventional end, which is not something we usually see. I will not spoil anything, but this film is unlike most monster films. Besides the fact that there is a huge monster and it is attacking NYC and its people, the similarities stop there.

There is no scientific mumbo jumbo, no real type of help, per se. There is just a small group of people and a video camera. We see what they see. Nothing more. It's pretty neat, and unlike the boring Blair Witch Project, actually effective, though I can imagine some people getting physically sick while watching this.

The other thing I was surprised about was that we actually got to learn quite a bit about the few characters. You actually care what happens to them.

The effects are pretty cool and the monster itself is quite interesting, especially the way it moves. Clearly alot of thought was put into the design.

There is no musical score in the film, which actually makes it seem more believable and real.

The film does have its flaws however. First, and most probably the biggest; it is not very scary, nor terribly suspenseful until about the last 10 minutes. Almost nothing is explained nor really resolved, but then again, we are only seeing what the characters see, nothing more, so I can't really fault that.

I found it exciting and enjoyable and would love to see some kind of a sequel, which I think would benefit this film even more.

The special features on the dvd are minute but kind of cool. Green Screen stuff, commentary. The alternate endings are almost undistinguishable from the original one, and not anything special. Even the bloopers were just eh.

All in all, a pretty fun ride, nothing more, nothing less.",1222387200,2,1860,4.719135802469136

1585617,1,B00005JPXY,"JJ Abram's Cloverfield offers unfortunate audiences worldwide a grossly malformed interpretation of what dimly passes for the Playstation meets Hollywood blockbuster. What -- if every GAP model ever auditioned threw a party in a SoHo loft and suddenly found themselves thrust into a live action-anime Armageddon so laughably concocted that most of the z-listed trend-bots who grimace their way through this mess find career prolonging mercy in an early death.

Cloverfield is a contemporary filmmaking cluster-f__K overdosing on shaky-cams, extemporaneous, exponentially stupid dialogue and plot-holes so cavernous that Mothra herself would be swallowed whole.

And, c'mon Mr. Abrams, the cost-of-entry in this genre has to be a somewhat convincing monster. Would you have me believe that NYC is being eviscerated by a creature that apparently combines the physical characteristics of a Velociraptor capped by the head of the Munster's Al Lewis and a tropical fish in dire need of anger management... and while we're at it... some bare bones plausibility as well... would you also have me believe that our extremely pissed-off extraterrestrial can throw the head of Lady Liberty from New York Harbor to Spring Street on the fly and barely mark the pavement. After nearly ninety minutes the only horror in evidence is that this castrated eyesore was ever greenlighted.

If Cloverfield were strictly a goof, all would be forgiven - however - there's a sulfuric whiff of a message interred within the comatose script - Japanese comeuppance or some such nonsense. This film is an atrocity in every respect so do yourself a favor and head to the nearest exit.",1221868800,6,1654,5.281368821292776
1585618,1,B00005JPXY,"I should have read the reviews before watching this.  It would have saved 73 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  That's how long the movie is, with 11 minutes of credits.

The style of the movie is the least of it's problems.  If fact, I liked the style of it.  Seeing things unfold strictly from the video camera's view is interesting, if done well, which this wasn't.

First, nobody running for their life is going to care about filming the action so much that they get all of the important parts of the story.  Add to that the uniqueness of the horror, a monster loose in the city, and the brain would probably turn off and think only of survival.

Second, the actual story was very thin.  One shot after another of people running every which way with the monster around somewhere.  This was really about the gimmick of seeing the action through the character's video camera.

Third, being only 73 minutes long, the inciting moment is about 19 minutes in.  Way too long for nothing to happen.

Fourth, the last thing recorded says that 7 hours have elapsed since the monster appeared, but only about 50 minutes is shown.  Why?  Because showing all 7 hours would be boring.  So it's edited even though it is presented as what is on the tape.

I could go on, and on, and on.

In one of the disc's features the director says that the intent was to give America another iconic monster like Japan's Godzilla, the only other one being King Kong.  What's funny is that the movie isn't really about the monster; it's about the kids with the video camera running around Manhattan!  So he fails to meet his own criteria.

Again, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  A complete waste.",1221868800,10,1696,4.456026058631922
1585619,5,B00005JPXY,"Like so many other monster fans, I was taken in by all the hype around Cloverfield.  I incorrectly predicted the monster's appearance based on a sketch, I correctly predicted that the movie wasn't about Cthulhu or Voltron, and then my son was born and I forgot about movies for a year.

I finally saw it.  And man is it good.

But you see, I'm a monster movie fan.  Cloverfield's marketing was intentionally minimalist, relying on viral marketing instead. One of the dangers of viral marketing is that it's viral, and thus doesn't necessarily distinguish by target market.  Indeed, the whole point of viral marketing is to get the word out to as many people as possible.  And many of those people aren't monster movie fans.

Look.  This is a monster movie.  If you don't like the fact that attractive people run around screaming, maybe you shouldn't watch a movie about a giant monster.  If you don't like the shaky cam effect, maybe the preview gave a hint that the movie wasn't for you.  And if you don't like the unrealistic nature of characters running in high heels, people surviving horrible wounds, and the insane bravery/stupidity of the protagonist, perhaps you shouldn't see a movie about a giant monster that comes out of nowhere and rips the head off the Statue of Liberty.

The joke's on us: Cloverfield is a love story cloaked in a monster movie. It's about the lengths our hero is willing to go to save his true love, a girl he's only just recently met.  In times of stress, our tenuous attachment to loved ones becomes all the more precious--if you lived in New York City during the 9/11 attacks, you knew that already.

Stripping away the complaints about the genre, as a monster movie Cloverfield knocks it out of the park.  To Abrams' credit, it's just as scary as we feared.  Only now we have real reason to fear the impact of a colossal assault on our city.  The movie is filmed the way we experienced 9/11, and the floating papers and dust from the collapse of a building are a sign that we know exactly what a monstrous attack looks like.

When 9/11 happened, I walked home from work.  I watched a cop stick his head out the driver's side window, so terrified of another attack from above that he was nearly drove off the road. Cloverfield invokes those fears: of confusion, of anarchy, of wanting to run but not knowing what's a safe place to run to anymore.  It is a monster movie made when the charm of monster movies can no longer be appreciated by the audience - we now know that if a giant monster attacked New York, evacuations would clog the streets, people would be poisoned by the debris, stock markets would crash, and worse.  It's not just about being afraid the monster will eat you.

Cloverfield has its giant monster and lets it eat too: it's an immediate physical threat and a mysterious menace, far more frightening than anything the Godzilla remake could muster.  In the same way Godzilla evoked fears of the atom bomb, Cloverfield is 9/11 reimagined as a hideous, unexplained thing from beyond.  The film is also fearless in facing the monster (literally) and reinforcing the helplessness we all felt in the face of such a huge disaster.  Forget the boogeyman under your bed: it's hundreds of feet tall and smashing its way down your street.

For monster movie fans, it doesn't get any better than this.",1221696000,4,3345,4.625423728813559
1585620,4,B00005JPXY,"Yes, CLOVERFIELD as a movie has lots of difficiences, including plot holes, too much camera bounce, sketchy acting, and a rather depressing ending.  But as the second step in a new style of filmmaking (Blair Witch Project being the first) it IS IMPRESSIVE!  After the first 20 minutes of Yuppie melodrama, the movie essentially turns into a theme-park ride.  You might not be sold on the acting, but you do feel that you're RIGHT THERE IN MANHATTAN AS THE CREATURE ATTACKS, and for me that was a new and invigorating experience.
  As videogames become ever-more realistic, I can imagine a Cloverfield-type game where you are part of the action, moving your control stick at crucial times to jump to the next building, run from the creature, etc.  This could be accomplished with present technology in the same manner as the old video-disc cartoon game ""Dragon's Lair"", where your joystick response at a crucial time automatically selected which video clip was played (one would show you successfully escaping, the other would show your death).  Years in the future, more powerful computers and software could allow a game with more detailed choices.
  So I won't lament Cloverfield's weaknesses.  We're seeing the birth of a new type of movie/gaming experience here...",1221609600,2,1268,5.052884615384615

1585623,5,B00005JPXY,"First, the movie is fantastic for what it is.  I'm 52-years-old and was a bit bored by the party scenes that open the movie but once things start to happen with Clover then...well, things really start to happen!  I've lived in Japan for twenty years, though, and can see how a culture like this one that so values its traditions can maintain an interest in and affection for its Godzilla, a manifestation of technology gone wrong, modernization gone wrong, weaponry and war gone wrong and so forth.  But I don't think Abrams' will reach his goal of creating an American Godzilla because Americans just don't relish seeing their cities destroyed, their subways gnawed on, their military shown up to be powerless and impotent.  (Keep in mind that Japan doesn't officially have an ""army"", and isn't officially allowed one, so here it's OK to make them look powerless -- as they don't officially exist!) This is a fantastic movie, though.  I just hope Abrams doesn't try to build on this particular monster, Clover, in the same way in the sequel.  I can't see how it could ever work.  Many people in Japan and around the world are quite fond of Godzilla.  I can't see this happening, and wouldn't care to see it attempted, with Clover.  Ah!  And the DVD special features are among the best I've seen.",1221004800,4,1296,4.6946902654867255
1585708,4,B00005JPXY,"When I saw the movie's trailer, I, like others, thought it was a film about terrorist attacks.  The trailer just offered enough to whet my appetite about the actual monster flick.  Unfortunately, I didn't see the film during its theatrical run and have recently viewed the DVD release.

""Cloverfield"" is, as all that have seen it believe to be the case, an American take on the decades-long ""Godzilla"" series from Japan.  Like that successfull movie franchise, ""Cloverfield"" features a skyscraper-busting beastie, intent on bringing down a major world city.

The filmmakers carefully keep the viewer's interest by giving ""peeks"" at the monster, never fully revealing it until the final few moments of the movie.

By having a cast of relative but talented unknowns, the movie has the air of a documentary, especially with the hand-held video camera technique and the lack of a musical score. For that, it deserves its hype.

The fact that the origins of the creature remain a mystery further adds to the movie's mystique.

However, the downer of an ending is probably the weakest aspect of the movie.

The movie, itself, might not deliver the thrills of, say, an ""Alien"" or even the intelligent writing of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" but it is still a much better film of its type than the ill-advised big-budget ""Godzilla,"" with Matthew Broderick, of a few years back.

Of the special features on the disc, the highlight is one devoted to ""the making of.."" the film. The production is very diverse, racially and internationally; thus, making for a fascinating look into the universal appeal of film.

Don't even waste your time if someone gives it to you for free (they are just trying to get rid of the worst movie ever).  Not even worth a look at $0.99 rentals.

Summary: Rob is leaving for Japan (hee GODZIRRA!) and Lily, his brother Jason's girlfriend, is throwing him a surprise going away party. Rob is in love with Beth, a girl he's been FRIENDS with since college - but are on the outs (watch the movie if you want to know why.) Beth leaves the party, cue big bangs and explosion, running and screaming, a glimpse of the monster and me feeling just a tad freaked out. Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud (your camera man for the evening) go off to save Beth - because that's what Rob wants, and he's kind of a big deal in this movie.

Why I liked this movie?
*The monster was actually very well done, and REAAAALY freaking scary looking.
*The hand held camera didn't bug me at all. I don't see why people are complaining about it. Maybe I'm used to watching home videos and youtube videos.
*I like what J.J.A. is trying to do (giving the US their own Godzilla).
*I actually watched the Extra features and have more of an understanding & appreciation for what they were going for.
*Unlike Blair Witch, it wasn't pretentious.
*The special effects were really great.

What I didn't like:
*The acting wasn't great. The only character I actually liked was Hud.
*I think there were other good story angles that could've been used that weren't so cliched as ""going to save the woman I love!""
*Because of the overlapping of the video, the very first part of the film was a bit confusing. Note! Pay attention to the date at the bottom of the screen.
*In an effort to make the film feel a little ""post-apocalyptic"" you get no extra information than what is provided on the home video. This left me kind of frustrated at the end.
*The love story was LAME. Would've done better if they focused more on the comedy and action.

It was okay for what it was. I hated BWP & Godzilla 98 - but I enjoyed this. I was entertained - I'm not afraid to say it! The monster put knots in my stomach. Ugly mofo.

Not only did the fact he kept turning around to film things seem impossible, especially as shots were being fired or buildings were collapsing, but even his voice got to be irritating.  I mean, honestly, if you were being attacked by strange alien beings would you keep recording?  Previous reviewers have pointed out whether people would actually follow someone into the center of alien-like activity rather than in the other direction, which is a good point.

Now, I do have to warn that the camera movements are extremely jerky.  If you liked *The Blair Witch Project* or even *Bourne Ultimatum*, then you'll enjoy the cinematic style here.  If you didn't, then stay away from this movie.

Friends are throwing Rob Hawkins a farewell party, including his brother, Jason, because he has accepted a prestigious position in Japan.  Among those attending is Rob's ex-girlfriend, Beth.  The appearance has put a damper in Rob's mood.  Feeling the tension, Beth leaves the party.

Oh, by the way, I left out the most important detail.  One of Rob's friend, Hud, has been handed the videocamera to record this party (and of course, throughout the movie).

After some time pass in the night, the unexpected happens.  New York City is under attack.  The first thing that people see is the head of Lady Liberty tumbling through the streets of Manhattan.  Then, everyone is scrambling towards safety.

While everyone is running away, a small group of friends, including Hud, Rob and Jason are going towards the chaos.  The reason is that Rob needs to rescue Beth, who is injured and trapped in her apartment.  Throughout the mission, we see, through the videocamera, glimpses of the monster and its man-eating spawns.

I thought that *Cloverfield* was very clever to show this type of chaotic occurrence through a videocamera.  By doing this, we do not know where the monster comes from nor do we know why it is attacking.  We only get tidbits from the people's encounters with the military, trying to protect humanity.  That alone can be frustrating but that was the whole point.

Now, I'm in the mood to see it again!",1219276800,3,1868,4.80188679245283

1) The camera movements were all of over the place. The movements of the camera made me sick and dizzy. I was hoping it would calm down, but didn't. And it looks like others had the same complaint. I know it's suppose to be a documentary style but documentaries don't have to be that jumpy.

2) The Story line was just plainly stupid.  This is a movie that took itself to seriously and tried to make something out of nothing.

3) The acting wasn't believable.  IF you're going to make a movie like this and use unknown actors. At least get top of the line acting since this maybe their big break. Not the ones the movie used since this maybe and only movie they make.

4) Not another Blair Witch Project. Hasn't Hollywood learned it's lesson.....yet. I guess as long as they're making money, they don't care.",1219190400,4,913,4.404761904761905

The movie is about an attack of some monsters in Manhattan and there is a guy that records with his camera the whole thing. I know that there are several movies like this and they really called my attention at the time I saw them (even when I'm not a fan of science fiction movies) I liked them.
The cover really says something completely different of what the movie is. Another thing that I must say about the movie is that it desesperates a little bit because the image is not steady, it is always shaking and you can't see the scenes very good.

1585977,4,B00005JPXY,"To give the utmost atmosphere of authenticity, `Cloverfield' films all its monster movie proceedings as though an amateur were using an average video camera.  All the starts and stops of footage are effective enough, and the glimpses of the modern equivalent of New York City's Godzilla keep tangible, but not always present.

Just like all disaster pictures, the prologue introduces us to all of the characters.  We need to know and care about them.  Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) and Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) wake up and talk of making a day of Coney Island for her first time.  Then, his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) takes over the camera later, and gets involved with a going away party for Rob, who has a job promotion in Japan.  Meanwhile, he and Beth have grown apart because of his move and some alleged infidelity. Beth comes with another date.  He and Beth have a tiff, and all the gossip hits the fan (or at least the camera).  To pass off the duty of filming little testimonial ""good-bye"" snippets, their friend, Hud (T.J. Miller), takes the camera.  Jason's girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), gets bossy with the festivities, particularly with Hud.  Interestingly enough he is a little shaky as a novice cameraman, but as chaos ensues into the night, he only improves.  Hud hits on Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), one of the shrinking violets who gets on the spot being filmed on camera.  Amazingly, Hud gets enough juicy gossip that no one finally shoves the camera in his face.

Just as our exposition becomes colorful and sordid enough, their apartment complex is shaken, the camera weaves back and forth, and lights flicker on and off.  News reports tell of an earthquake near Manhattan with a possible ensuing oil spill.  Chaos spills out in the streets in 9/11-like fashion as people run and shriek as some yet unseen hazard.  Effectively, Hud runs with the camera out of breath.  After a cell phone call with Beth, Rob, resolved and chivalrous, goes against the grain of the crowd and heads towards Beth's apartment on the side of town seen to contain the most peril.  Jason, Marlena, Hud, and Lilly try to reason with him to stay with the flow, but Rob refuses, eventually talking them into going to save Beth.  Soon Jason is killed, and they must think and act quickly.

Much of the movie goes through the subway system, fending off more than one big monster as military personnel occasionally whiz past their direction, fighting all the city's aliens and gathering the injured civilians.

With a running time of 1:19 'Cloverfield' wisely tightens up its story as South Korea's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Host/dp/B000PKG8TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Host</a>' failed to do. In that movie, it started out awesomely wild and scary, but lingered too long and drum beat it's satiric message to death.  After 9/11, I must admit my eyes welled up with tears several times during the movie.  A pre-9/11 'Cloverfield' would have had me engrossed in an arcade, the kind the Superman movies of the late seventies and early eighties did, but not any more.  However, a pre-9/11 `Cloverfield' wouldn't be the same, either.  The frightening scenes do their job, but they mostly go for reality, which they do in spades.  Suspension of belief is seldom an issue.

Fading reality:  Only three parts didn't do it for me.  One is when they're on the subway tracks talking about Superman as if he were real.  Did they decide to do dialogue, so we'd know this isn't `War of the Worlds' after making things so lively and genuine?  Also, when they come upon a military medical tent, one army man says, ""The monster is winning.""  To me in real life, gung ho military personnel say something heartening but honest like ""We're going to beat this thing, don't worry!""  Of course that would tip the dramatic tension, but reality was the movie's goal.  I also think at one point, the camera would get dropped sooner than it did, but that doesn't work to make this movie.

From other reviews, I was suspicious 'Cloverfield' would get shaky views to the point of irritation or tedium.  I didn't feel that way.  In a small way, 'Cloverfield' is a mini 'Matrix' or 'Blair Witch Project,' innovative and effective enough to steal our interest and undoubtedly spawn more films to compete with this one.

Perhaps if the film slowed down to give insight into the plot or even the characters we might even care about these lost party souls. Are they real actors or were they just scooped up off Sunset!

The characters are almost incidental, the real excitement is the game of hide and seek that the filmakers play with the audience concerning the monster.  The big reveal is worth the price of the movie.  The creature is genuinly original and even kind of scary in its abstract sort of way.  The cast of talented but relative unknowns keeps the viewer focused on the story and on the edge of their seat waiting for just one more glimpse of the creature.

Wonder if any of them will be able to get a job on the back of this film--I hope so, since no one is really bad, except for the jackass holding the camera, who proves that whatever Seth Rogen has, he's not sharing it with his peers.

But he plays ""Hud,"" and otherwise steers clear of the androgynous spirit, always playing the big dumb guy so, he's consistent.  No one's superbad, ha ha, and a few of the actors actually rise to the challenge and give it a go.

1586027,3,B00005JPXY,"By reading the other reviews, I get the feeling that many of their authors are basing their reviews of their experiences in the theater.  I have seen this movie on the small-screen only, and will state that the hand-held camera point-of-view of this movie is not that bad when seen on a 21-inch screen.  You still all the important details of each scene, without getting sick in either the head or stomach.

Now to the story itself.  New York City is being wrecked by a 300-feet tall monster.  This creature has two short hind legs and two long front legs that also double as arms.  The creature's skin looks smooth and dark, and its head is long with teeth inside a horizontal mouth and what seems like two short horns; one beside each side of the mouth.  Overall, the monster has a general body outline of a stretched frog.  The monster does not breathe fire, or shoot anything out of any orifice, or fly.  But it does carry around multitudes of smaller creatures, each about the size of a large dog.  These smaller creatures look like gigantic locusts; they have skinny bodies with hard exoskeletons, six long jointed legs per body, and can crawl up walls and jump really high.  These smaller creatures are each armed with a long jaw full of sharp teeth, which they use to eat people.  At first, I thought they were offspring of the bigger monster, but then I watched the special features.  One of the special features basically explains that this 300-foot creature is an alien baby that crawled out of NYC harbor and into the city.  Like a human baby who has just come across a pen full of new toys, there is a lot of screaming, biting, kicking and knocking things over.  So with our baby monster; it knocks buildings over, bites people, and roars a lot.  The smaller dog-sized creatures are most likely parasites living on the skin of the bigger monster; like fleas on a dog.

Now to the positives and negatives.  Positives first.  The monster looks real and original.  The special effects are wonderful.  The smaller insect-like creatures are really scary.  And the cast is comprised of unknowns, which is original for action flick.  Now the negatives.  First off, the US military seem hopeless when attacking the monster.  They miss a lot.  A lot of missiles end up hitting buildings.  Even at point-blank range, many of the tanks miss the monster.  Second, the main group of characters actually head towards the monster to find a friend instead of away from it.  Why not go around it?  Third, the ending sucked.  Essentially, we the audience are watching a playback of someone's home recording of a monster attack, and when the recording stopped, the movie ended.  It would have been nice to include some sort of epilogue; was the monster killed?  Was there only one of them?

Some other features of this movie to know.  First of, there is no soundtrack, which I guess is appropriate given that this movie is basically one person's footage of a city's destruction.  Second, the movie's title, Cloverfield, is some codename given to the site of the monster attack by the US military.  Third, there are some bloody scenes, and the movie should be rated R, even though it is a PG-13.  And last, this is a short movie, under 1.5 hours in length.  Overall, its worth the time to watch it; though it is no monster classic like say King Kong or Godzilla.",1216857600,,3355,4.631578947368421

1586034,5,B00005JPXY,"Ok for those who hate this movie, I completely understand why, it can be shallow.... HOWEVER. personally I LOVED this film!

The idea of a monster film, shot entirely first person view point was a BRILLIANT idea! It completely takes you into the action, shows you the scale of things and what these characters are actually seeing! From the near beginning, where the person holding the camera (Hud) is trying to chat up his girl, it just seems so realistic, especially when he pushes through the crowd to ask her if she's alright! EVERY guy would do the same if he were trying to pick up that ONE girl. The view point also gives you the sneaky little shots of the monster that keep you intrigued, and the camera is usually a second too late to see the action. The noise occurs the camera whips around and we see the aftermath or destruction.

Also adding to the recorded on a standard video camera we see little glimpses of a month before, detailing Rob and Beth's relationship each time the camera is stopped. I LOVE IT!!!

AND now I have it on dvd I finally see that bloody crashing satellite at the VERY end! I saw the movie 9 times in the cinema and NEVER saw it! but then agaijn it's little more than a black dot in the distance...

Now for those who question the thin plot, you watch it on BLU RAY with the special investigation mode. It gives you SO much more depth of where the monster came from, who's responsible for it and where it came from! IT'S FANTASTIC!!

You see after I heard they were doing a sequel I was surprised because I didn't think there was enough groundwork for another one, but after watching that special feature I am SO looking forward to it!!!

The funniest thing I've heard from many people I know, is that the camera movement made them sick! which I guess it's possible... but personally I have VERTIGO and have had it since 2005 and I was fine with this film... but don't mention 'A Scanner Darkly' to me.... I do get sick from the slightest of things... so I'm surprised this film had no effect on me!

""Cloverfield"" was a surprise.  I really didn't know what to expect as the flavor of the movie wasn't revealed all that much in the trailers.  As the movie progressed ... a little slowly at first ... I began to expect a ""Blair Witch Project"" kind of film but this one, thank goodness, was better.  I bought ""Cloverfield"" on a whim and, considering that I am house-bound now, it is actually cheaper and easier for me to wait until a movie comes out on DVD then just buy it.  Cheaper than actually going to the theater, all things considered, and actually easier, physically, for me to see movies this way, now.  Thank you, Amazon!

Well, anyway, this thing was the first movie I've seen in many years that wasn't done from the omniscient point of view ... or had all the ends tied up by the time the credits rolled.  By the presence of the Department of Defense labels, classifications, etc. shown at the begining and the end, I assumed that *someone* survived and that the video was found ... and I likewise assumed that none of the characters survived but I wasn't sure about exactly what was going on until the end.

1586088,3,B00005JPXY,"(That's how I talk while the camera's shaking)
Thank goodness I saw this on my 37"" LCD.  The big screen experience would have been awful for 2 reasons;
1. The infamous shaky cam would have been unbearable.
2. Its not good enough to pay theater prices.
On the small screen the shaking camera can get annoying but is not such a big deal.  I thought the film was just OK and here's why:

-C-C-COOL M-M-MONSTERS
Why monsters are trending towards superfluous limbs, I don't know (see ""The Host"").  Regardless, this beasty is pretty impressive in his (her?) 10 minutes of screen time.  It's in these scenes that the shaky cam is at its most effective.  It looks so real and feels like many nightmares I've had of giant creatures invading my neighborhood.  The parasites you may have heard about (the beasty scrapes them off on buildings like a bear on an oak) are equally terrifying.  In their 5 minutes of screen time, we learn so much about them and what we learn is horrific.  So add it up and you get 15 minutes of monsters.  Not nearly enough, but what we get is pretty darn creepy.

-S-S-SILLY P-P-PEOPLE
I'm not sure what scared me more; the beasties or spending 55 minutes alone with these stupid people who are passed off as the main characters.  The camera man is a complete dope (though he has genius enough to record everything while keeping his battery alive).  He later develops a personal relationship with the beasty.  The films hero is a whiney drip who risks all for his love; ok, I'll go with it.  I'm not cutting the same slack to his stupid friends though.  Let him go and save his girl, you will only be a hindrance (trust me).  Of course, they can't hear me and they will be sorry!  If you don't believe anyone else then you must believe me; THESE PEOPLE SUCK!!!  We see way too much of them and they are not at all interesting people.  Of course, this lends to the believability of the film.

-B-BRIDGES AND B-BUILDINGS
There is a scene on a bridge that is very convincing and very creepy.  It looks all too real.  I have not heard much mention of the actual destruction of New York specifically, but I was impressed with how realistic it looked.  The ruined cityscape in Cloverfield is one of the most convincing I've seen.  There are definitely some redemptive qualities in the effort.

-V-V-VERDICT
Since I watched the rental, I am considering buying this (when it costs around $6).  The only reason I would buy it would be to see the monsters and some interesting destruction scenes.  I would not care to watch most of the human relationship aspects of this film; they are painfully boring and comprise about 60% of the film.  To the film makers; I have to give credit for the attempt, but don't do it again.

1586089,1,B00005JPXY,"What others have said is true:  this is a clumsy hybrid of Blair Witch and the most recent Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick, right down to the baby monsters popping up all over.  There is nothing original here at all, actually.  (Orson Welles used the same techniques on radio nearly 70 years ago - but his ""War of the Worlds"" was ground-breakingly brilliant!)  This flick's poster is more rivetting than the actual film - yet even the poster is derivative of the closing shots of the original 'Planet of the Apes.' I also never knew any camcorder battery to last as long as Hud's does in this movie. The monster also looks totally fake and stupid. Anyway - a far better film in this same genre is ""The Host"" out of South Korea a few years ago.  Now there was a well-made big monster movie with big human themes! Terrific special effects and music score, too.  Lousy dubbing...but still a thousand times better than ""Cloverfield.""",1215907200,14,934,4.63030303030303

1586092,5,B00005JPXY,"Feel good films are about feeling good and feel bad films are about feeling bad.  Cloverfield unapologetically falls into the latter category.  Filmed from the perspective of an amateur camera, I immediately fell into its chaotic rhythm and felt borderline nausea, which actually worked for me, amplifying the intensity of the horrifying circumstances.  Whether or not the directors, producers, or editors consciously intended that or not does not matter, the end result was an immersive, captivating, first-person experience, whose discomfort was simultaneously repulsive and hypnotic.  I felt I was trapped inside the film right alongside its victims.  The hectic, scrambling kinematics produced an atmosphere of motion sickness, panic, and disorientation, providing only fleeting glimpses of the horrifying monster, a ""less is more"" taunting that had me almost craning my neck to get a better look.  If Hitchcock did sci-fi horror today, it would turn out something like this gem.

With so many predecessor monster flicks having desensitized movie goers for several generations, this film was quite risky.  It could have been a routine flop had it taken a safer, but incongruous approach of delivering this order of death and mayhem through a more traditionally aimed lens and richer cinematography.  Boldly eschewing slicker visual story telling for its uglier amateur camera perspective transcended the pedantic mechanics of movie production and elevated the resulting experience to that of viewing art.

At 45, I thought I was too old and jaded to get enthused about yet another monster flick, but Cloverfield is a worthy refresher of the Godzilla film genre, and a brilliantly crafted spectacle.",1215907200,5,1702,5.461832061068702

1586095,5,B00005JPXY,Most of the time I avoid watching trailers as they sometimes give away much of what's in a movie. As for Cloverfield all I had seen was the image of the original poster showing the decapitated Statue of Liberty. I had a gut feeling it was a movie similar to Independence Day where Earth is attacked by alients. But I didn't have the faintest idea of what was in store. What an innovative and creative film. The creativity and screenplay are brilliant. Personal video has become a habit these days and expanding that idea into making a horror movie was brilliant. The screenplay (if you haven't watched the trailer) doesn't let you find out what the movie is all about and keeps you guessing for quite some time. Full points to director Matt Reeves and crew. I understand that this movie could give you a pain in your neck or your head (maybe even make you dizzy) in the Cinema hall but on your monitor at home it is perfect. The screen can get dark at times but not compromising on clarity and whatever needs to be seen is clearly visible. Talk of a sequel is being circulated on the net and I am sure it will be well worth the wait. There is a point in the movie where two video makers meet. So it is only interesting and curious to know what the other person has also filmed.

The first couple of glimpses of him are enough, but instead we get this kind of idiotic American-movie 'got to see him over and over' and reach the climax we do.  I was expecting the tricks to spook me and when they came I failed to get spooked because I had predicted how I would get spooked.

I read the reviews and I thought this could be a really great movie - only to be extremely disappointed.  The camera action (jitter) was probably put in afterwards to hid the fact that this movie sucks.  Its boring, the dialog is horrible and a waste of time.

Thankfully, I skipped forward to get through it.  Unbearable.  Its a movie so bad the movie pirates skipped it.  That's how good it is.",1215302400,5,501,4.092783505154639
1586192,5,B00005JPXY,"Going into Cloverfield, I was incredibly curious. Would I vomit from the camera? Could this monster be the next Godzilla? Could a movie work with NO stars? Could J. J. Abrams flop in the face of hype again? To answer those in order: No, Doubtfully, Yes, No. In fact, I think this movie is an instant classic that isn't afraid to turn Hollywood rules on its head. What Abrams and company do is take the old premise of monster in NYC and take it from a whole new Point of View. And POV is what this movie is all about.

Main Camera Man Hud is obviously not good with the camera, as seen in the beginning, compared with Jason's camera work. Being from the younger demographic, this shaky-cam doesn't phase me at all, since I am probably used to YouTube effect. And let me say, if you thought Hud's camera work was bad, you should see mine. Nobody would have made it out of the theater without falling down in a dizzy drunken stupor. So anyways, while we're used to the normal omniscient camera style of the all-seeing-eye, seeing everything, this style does have its advantages. It provides the film's best ""Oh Crap!"" moment in the tunnel, when they turn on night vision.

The bad thing about this style is the fact that it's very hard to keep up with the camera, and everything going around. So, it's kind of hard to tell which person is dying, and who is alive. It didn't help any that both Beth and Lizzy were both brunettes. So, it took me awhile to figure out what happened on the Brooklyn Bridge, who was put into the helicopter first, and who was with Rob at the very end. I also didn't know that Lizzy's helicopter went down. But thankfully, there's Wikipedia to give you a scene-by-scene summery of the movie's events.

I also liked the little touch where everytime the camera was turned off, you had the little moment's of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date. Not much, but it just seems to strangely work in the movie, and gives a nice break to the action going on around.

Speaking of action, it's pretty darn good for a movie made on the budget of most romantic comedies. The suspense and action keeps you on your toes, and there's plenty of cringe moments that keeps the mood all the more intense. Although I really could have done without the exploding stomach and the rescue of the impaled girl. But I thank the movie for being restrained, since they could have easily gone into R-Territory, which would have made the whole film a cheesy horror film. Oh yeah, it would be ""The Blair Witch Project.""

Let me also say that the famous/infamous Statue of Liberty head in the streets scene, will go down as one of the classic Hollywood scenes. I mean, the scene is just so classic. Head flying down and rolling down in the streets. The Shock. The ""OH MY GOD!"" being repeated over and over. The Surprise. Total classic.

For being a no-star movie, everybody in the cast does an excellent job. There's no bad acting, no fake acting, all the emotions seem real, and in fact, these actors do a better job than their more famous counterparts would do. And for a lack of character development, I liked most of the characters in the movie, and when I could tell that they just died, I was saddened by their loss. Except for Marlena, who I didn't get the appeal of.

However, when it came to Hud, I was deeply saddened by his loss. Maybe it's because I'm a fan of T.J. Miller since he stole the show on the now cancelled Carpoolers. The guy is just likable, and he brings his personality to Hud. Alas, this brings me to  my next complaint.

Why did Hud have to die? I mean, he just seems to be cheapened when he's eaten by the creature, just for the sake of us getting a facial glimpse of the monster. I would have liked it if Hud was like the only survivor, and found a way to escape operation ""Hammer Down."" Sure, incredibly unlikely, but still. Instead, the film ends up a bit depressing, since basically every character you've met during the course of the film, is dead. And the monster seems to still be alive. Yet, it's nice to see the profession of love at the end, and it again, strangely seems to work.

But for all of that, you also have to add the realism of the entire thing. I mean, if a monster like that were really to attack NYC (highly unlikely), that's probably how it would take place. And most importantly, these seemed like real characters, not cardboard cutouts of twenty-somethings.

So overall, for it's realism, originality, execution, characters, and premise, this movie earns the title of ""Instant Classic."" It defines a era that is 2008, where terrorism is the first thing you think of when a major disaster happens, the YouTube/Camera Phone culture and just society in general. It's the little things that make the movie more than the big things, and they work in unexpected ways. Sure, I would have probably changed a couple of things, but it all seems to work. As for the rumor of sequels, I'm a bit hesitant, as is the crew, because you really need a new gimmick, as this has already been done. And quite well I might add.",1215302400,3,5051,4.461538461538462

The helicopter crash has to be one of the most invigoratingly exciting things to watch in a theatre, it made me feel like my young life was soon coming to an abrupt end.

1586196,3,B00005JPXY,"The idea behind the film is clever, even if it is a bit obvious -- to the point where it's surprising nobody has done anything quite like it, or at least nothing on a similar scale. Somebody thought, let's make a monster mayhem flick but instead of a blockbuster make it an indie, shot amateur style: Godzilla meets the Blair Witch. That allows them to economize on the special effects, using sparing effects that would work on tv but not on the big screen -- but when shot on a consumer video camera by a guy who can barely keep it aimed long enough to get a clear picture who can tell the difference?

As far as that premise goes, the film kind of works. It keeps you on the edge of your couch, it moves at a fast pace with a healthy balance between emotional drama and massive monster mayhem.

The shoddy camera work does detract from the experience of watching it. I wish the filmmakers had come up with some reason to put the camera in the hands of a slightly more competent videographer. I understand that without hand held camera work this would be a different film -- and probably not novel enough to fly -- but I wish that they'd gone more in the direction of independent film handheld work (as in, say, the Dogme 95 films of Lars von Trier or Thomas Vinterberg or Harmony Korine) rather than the direction of ""totally clueless guy who for some reason never lets go of the camera but doesn't make much of an effort to point it in coherent ways.""

The emotional drama of the film centers around a bunch of good looking 20 somethings who have all gathered to say farewell to a buddy who is going to Japan. It turns out he just slept with his gorgeous best friend and then, because he didn't know how to deal with their relationship before he left, decided not to call her again, but is extremely upset when she shows up to his party on the arm of another guy. His need to rush into extreme danger to save her didn't have the emotional pull for me that, say, the much better Korean monster flick The Host delivered in a family that pulls together to save their missing child. The problem here is that there isn't enough to show that the characters we are supposed to be rooting for are really all that likeable.

In spite of all this, I had a good time watching the film. I do think that the ""do it yourself"" aesthetic of this film is intriguing and reveals a lot of possibilities that this film didn't exhaust. Worth a watch -- by no means a classic.",1215216000,,2457,4.311688311688312

I loved it, and my wife hated it) Something you SHOULD know before watching this movie, is that it is shot entirely from a handheld video camera. Entirely. That means there is alot of moving and shaking and bouncing all around. (think Blair Witch Project, but in NYC) I personally liked the personal frame of reference. I guess it just made it feel more real, and me feel less detached from it. The dialogue in some of the scenes didn't quite fit. Characters cracking jokes at times, and in situations, where they obviously wouldn't. There is no bow on this one tying everything together folks. The end is just the end. There's no twist, and there are no explanations. It's pretty simply. Monster attacks New York, and people run for their lives.",1215216000,2,892,4.687898089171974

1586291,1,B00005JPXY,I actually saw this movie at the theatre.  I could barely watch for more than 10 minutes at a time.  At one point in the movie because the continual movement of the camera i had to get up and leave.,1215043200,6,198,3.925
1586292,5,B00005JPXY,"Of course, reviewers are going to complain about the shaky camcorder photography. Whether or not it made them dizzy or ill depends upon their own sensibilities; perhaps they are the people who become easily car sick or air sick; perhaps on the big screen in a dark theatre the moving images are magnified. I don't know; I viewed it on DVD.

Okay. But without the camcorder perspective, what do we have? Another throwback to 1950s post-atomic fallout science-fiction with giant squids, giant octopii, scorpians, locusts, spiders, ants, and preying mantises -- all the result of man's carelessness with nuclear detonations? The story, of course, is nothing: Beth and Rob ""had sex"" (woooooooo -- how old are these people? young sophisticated New York Yuppies or midwestern twelve-year-olds?) No. The story is nothing, but the presentation is everything -- point of view is the central gimmick and existential premise. Versimilitude is all -- the unreal is made to look real.

Film scholar Louis D. Giannetti reminded us years ago that each new camera set-up in a motion picture, between or even within shots, presents viewers with a new perspective from which to evaluate what they see. Films, for example, often combine omniscient narration with the first person, and the director may cut directly from first-person subjective point-of-view shots to objective camera angles, from close-ups to gauge reactions of single characters to long shots [UNDERSTAND MOVIES. 2nd ed. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1976].

Many films have, through the years, relied heavily on the subjective camera (e.g., LADY IN THE LAKE, 1946) and those FRIDAY THE 13th blood- baths where horny teenages at Crystal Lake are murdered one by one. In Jack Arnold's 3-D film IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, 1953), audiences are given control over the earthlings because the point of view when they confront the aliens is from the aliens' perspective, a device that allows the audience to see the earthlings as victims. The residents of the sleepy desert town of Sand Rock, Arizona, fimd themselves enveloped in the billowing fog that borders the vision of the viewers while they stalk victims from behind the bubble-eye of the aliens.

CLOVERFIELD is part of this subjective camera sub-genre. It begins disarmingly enough with a clever, non-horror title -- quite inspired -- not what one would expect for a monster movie like those of the 1950s or the awful Godzilla imports. The tape found in the camcorder is the whole story -- from the beginning when Rob is sneaking up on Beth during the morning-after sequence to the Coney Island close-ups of Beth giggling into the lens -- to the ending when we are back at Coney Island, the part of the tape which was not inadvertently taped over by beginner videographer ""Hud"" (coaxed into taking on videotaping chores by the hero's brother who wants a record of the party which is celebrating the brother's departure to Japan). The ending of the tape is the ending of the film, showing Rob and Beth's idyllic time together before the mayhem -- the tape which has now, according to the beginning of the film, become part of an official government documentation of the events.

The New York setting provides understandable echoes of 9-11 -- another terrorist attack, as some of the panicked characters speculate. Fortunately, the cinema verite plot focuses more on the fleeing citizens than on the scientists and military types that we saw in the 1950s, but with 21st century dialogue and profanity. Even one of the military officers looks like an alumnus from the TWIN PEAKS television series, but he is onscreen in only fleeting, hand-held shots. I wonder if he complained to his agent about this. We even see scenes of enterprising thieves breaking into an electronics store and looting it -- an aspect of disasters that, unfortunately, are all too real and commonplace. Even our hero, the Tom Cruise clone, steals a phone in order to call his trapped former girl friend, Beth. As they try to cross the bridge to Brooklyn, the hero's brother is wiped out, along with many others, when the tail of the gigantic creature descends on the historical structure. So much for being an iconoclast -- first the Statue of Liberty is decapitated; then the famous bridge is sawed in half. No respect.

CLOVERFIELD may not be the overnight commercial success that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT enjoyed, but it is as least as effective, and the denouement is just as downbeat. Quit whining about the shaking camera and enjoy the experience for what it is supposed to be -- an exercise in verisimilitude.",1214870400,6,4596,4.985658409387223

1586348,1,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield the monster movie: The Cloverfield monster (Clover) is never really explained. It's just a big thing with no origin that trashes a major metropolitan area for no apparent reason. Granted, this is a formula that's worked before. But, since our perspective as the movie viewer is tied to a group of civilians who's only interest is in getting the people they care about to a safe distance, the entire film is spent running away from any and all action that they encounter. This makes sense from the point of view of the character, but from the viewer's point of view it means that there really isn't any plot surrounding the monster. It simply is there and it's trashing things without motivation. Even B-grand monster movies like Godzilla have SOME sort of motivation for the monster to be doing what it's doing.

So, since the monster has no motivation, no plot, and few appearances, it's existence as a character ranks just bellow the pressurized oxygen tank in Jaws. With that in mind, I can't really classify this as a monster movie.

Cloverfield the Romance: Cloverfield has three distinct romances. There's the reliable couple, the couple that slept together once but never became a couple in spite of both their feelings, and the couple that isn't ever really a couple because it's just a guy who has a crush on a girl who happens to be tagging along. The first one ends right after the attack with death and the third one ends with the girl exploding because apparently that's what happens to you when you're bitten by the little monsters that fall off the big monsters, which happens before anything happens between the two. So, we must assume that the primary romance is the second romance. Over half of the movie is spent with the male or the romance trying to find the female and saver her from the destruction. When she is eventually saved, she's injured very badly and not really coherent for the remainder of the film. Eventually, the two almost reconcile their difference and become an item, but they get blown up before they really get a chance.

So, three romances, all of which end in death. The only one that survives to the end of the film never really happens anyway. Clearly, not a romance film.

Cloverfield the Disaster Movie: Disaster movies are great. Everything comes crashing down and the world (or at least the portion we're concerned with) is leveled. And with a giant thing decapitating the Statue of Liberty, this is a very promising possibility. But, we never find out what's been destroyed, though we can assume that a big chunk of New York has been bombed at the end.

So, some portion of New York has been destroyed, we think. Not enough to go on to be a disaster movie.

Cloverfield the Movie: Every movie has a story. Stories consist of a beginning, a middle, and an end. There's a beginning, though it seems only loosely tied in to the film. And it has a middle. That's where everyone is running around for some reason. But, it doesn't really have an end, it just sort of stops. Not only that, but in all of the film, nothing really happens. The characters just run from A to B to C to D. Everything they do is eventually negated. There is no character growth, and no real change to the status quo once the monster attacks. Cloverfield has all the plot of a bowl of cereal.

So, without any sort of story line, I personally can't even qualify this as a movie.

Cloverfield the preview: Cloverfield has a lot of hints as to what the plot could be, clips showing that there's a monster doing something, and an unresolved conclusion that suggests that everything we hold dear could be threatened. But, previews are pretty carefully made. They only use the best clips and they leave you wanting more. Cloverfield is mostly shots that could have been cut and within 15 minutes of the action cutting in I just wanted it all to be over so I could do something better with my time like organizing my sock drawer.

Cloverfield even fails to be a preview.

Cloverfield the classified military film: Cloverfield starts out with white type on a black screen telling us that this is a video found at the location that used to be Central Park. This suggests that this is a film the government has found and has analyzed in order to better understand what happened. Kind of a cool concept for a film; kind of voyeuristic. But the government, having already processed the film and put a title in, would have cut the first chunk and just used the part of the film that takes place while the monster is attacking. Not only that, but the military would probably have abandoned this film anyway as there is no tactical advantage to analyzing this film. There are no clear shots of the monster to analyze, nothing in the film shows the movement of the monster across the city, in fact there is absolute nothing in this film that says anything about what went wrong, why it went wrong, and how we can avoid it in the future. So, rather than use this film, the government would have most likely destroyed it or declassified it and given it to the press.

My conclusion is that Cloverfield is a mess. They had a monster that could have been really cool, that had plenty of time they could have built a plot, and they had roles which could have been filled by characters with depth that we cared about. But, the monster was lame, there was no plot, and I never really cared if the characters lived or died.",1214611200,18,5432,4.57245632065776
1586349,5,B00005JPXY,"It took me a long time to purchase this movie. I read reviews on Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes and Christian Spotlight on Entertainment. The critics really seemed to be slamming this movie.

My curiosity finally won out, and I bought the Blu-ray dvd.

I was blown away. This movie was great. I don't know what all the fuss is about.

Sure it wasn't perfect and you can nitpick here and there. But when it comes down to it, this movie is quite enjoyable, with plenty of keep you on the edge of your seat tension. The acting was very convincing and I felt a connection and sympathy with most of the characters. The actors came across as real people, even though they were all very good looking - but that's a bit of a plus I think. I was thoroughly entertained and think back on this movie fondly. It was over all too soon, I was left wanting more!

I have a 40"" 1080p TV, so the nausea that people complained about never was an issue, as it might have been watching this on a huge theater screen. The shaking wasn't excessive nor distracting to me, I quickly got used to it. What I usually hate in modern day movies are the MTV type quick edits, which doesn't happen here. You get long duration shots, not quick flashing every 2 seconds from scene to scene.

The monster, a rather odd conception, nonetheless did it's job and was a terrifying creature indeed.

As a Blu-ray feature, I found the picture quality and sound to be first rate. This movie occurs mostly at night, and the contrast levels, color and sharpness met my expectations.

All in all, Cloverfield was well worth the money spent.",1214611200,6,1589,4.439862542955327
1586350,4,B00005JPXY,"I love it when someone finds a new way to tell an old story, and that is exactly what Cloverfield is.  If you seperate how the story is told, the plot is basically a Godzilla destroying Manhattan kind of movie, which has been made dozens of times in the last 80 years, but what makes Cloverfield noteworthy is the way it's told.

The story is shown through a camcorder recording the whole thing as it happens by the people experiencing it, like Blair Witch Project, except this time you see the monsters.  The movie is extremely suspenseful and the way it's filmed made me feel like I was a part of the group, like I knew these people and had a vested interest in their survival.

The movie is exciting and I didn't want to miss one second of it.  THe movie was very short on explanation, but if I was there in NY when this happened I don't think I would stop and ask ""How?"" I would want to get out of there as soon as I could.

I have heard that they are going to make a sequel to this about the same night from another persons point of view, which sounds intrigueing so we'll see.

The cast is mostly unknowns that do a good job looking scared out of their minds.

1586351,1,B00005JPXY,"It had the appearance of a movie but was more waste than movie. A movie needs a plot and sympathetic characters for the audience to relate to. Seeing a group of 20 something party rats try to act through a shaky camera is just bad movie making. Sorry, I called this a movie, my mistake. There is usually a progression of intensity containing intelligent dialog and character interaction, building to a motivating event that drives the rest of the movie. I found the action, from the beginning, to be too intense for build up. It's like being drunk before you drink.
The characters were thoroughly unlikable and immature. Is sleeping together enough of a motivation for a monster movie?
And speaking of the monster, what was that? If this was inspired by Godzilla, then the inspired person should realize that the iconic image of Godzilla is rooted in the culture from which it came. This bowlegged creature has no relevance in American culture and lacks the archetypal  quality to be an effective threat. It was just another grandiose CGI effect as was most of the movie.
Just because the possibility of making a superior CGI movie exists, shouldn't be the basis of a movie over good characters or a plot.

1586354,3,B00005JPXY,"In an effort to make `An American Monster Movie' in the vein of Godzilla, JJ Abrams (Alias, Mission Impossible 3) launched his idea of a mysterious creature coming out of New York Harbor and trashing the city with an intriguing teaser trailer.  A group of young Manhattan yuppies are in the middle of a going away party for their friend who is leaving, suddenly there is what feels like an earthquake, then an explosion up in the distance that collapses a skyscraper.  Then the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the middle of the street and slides to a halt, showing a lot of damage and leaving us wondering...'What the HELL?""  There ends the teaser trailer.

There are few things more terrifying then seeing a catastrophic event unfold in the eyes of a person who is actually seeing it happen and recording it at the same time.  Lets put aside the questionably realistic aspects such as how this one person came across so many events of the attack that we get to see so much.  And that these young people would venture back into the city to rescue their friend who they believe is trapped.  Focusing on those things just raises skepticism.  Let's remember, this is a MOVIE...about a MONSTER; basic suspension of disbelief is required when you first walk in on this one.

So, moving on.  The concept of the movie being shot with a hand held camera is not new, everyone remembers `The Blair Witch' project.  Some remember it and get nauseated at the thought of it.  This one is not nearly as bad, however it is like watching the entire story through a drinking straw.  You only gets specific pieces of information at one time.  The film makers use this to their advantage whenever possible.  It actually cuts on production costs and allows things like off camera sounds to have a greater affect.

Now for the plot;  The video starts at the beginning as if being viewed by an official group, probably Military or high Government.  It is deemed `Classified' and titled `Cloverfield'.  The drama starts with two young people who have had an intimate night together.  Then the video kicks over to the preparation for the aforementioned party.  The party is for Rob, who is leaving for Japan.  Rob is in love with Beth (the couple at the beginning of the video), and vice versa. Apparently they have been for a long time.  But only recently did they consummate their feelings and then document their day afterward at Coney Island on the same video camera.  Once the party is in full swing, the festivities are abruptly interrupted by explosions and earthquakes.  As Hud, one of the party goers, documents the attack, there are moments where he stops recording and you see glimpses of Rob and Beth's `Good Day'.  This is a reminder of why Rob goes back into the city for her.  He regrets not following up on his feelings for Beth after their night together, especially after she shows up at the party with a date.  He feels compelled to go rescue her if possible because he won't just wait to find out what happens to her later.  This is the stuff of young compulsive love, and over the top drama; `do anything for it, damn the consequences'.  But it is a somewhat valid reason as to why the four turn to go back into the city to give us better glimpses of this creature who is tearing up the city.

The movie has some genuinely terrifying scenes and the special effects are top notch.  You get a good sense of this being real and you don't ever really find yourself telling the guy to point the camera in a specific direction.  They seem to get everything you need to see.  The monster itself is a strange sight to behold.  There is never any explanation for it's appearance or it's purposes.  Many theories are thrown out but nothing is really confirmed.  The ending is very ambiguous and really leaves things out in the open.  I have to say I liked this movie but mostly for it's single perspective use of the camera and how well it's told through this method.  Had it been shot in a standard way, it would not have been as entertaining.  Nor would it give any clout to the ending.  I give it three and half stars.",1214438400,,4115,4.521680216802168

But ""Blair Witch"" is a subtle masterpiece of steadily mounting terror.  You have the time to get to know the characters and see how their awful fates are ingeniously worked out.  By contrast, ""Cloverfield"" overwhelms you with its visuals and special effects, but the experience proves to be exhausting and emotionally remote.  Because so much happens so fast the filmmakers apparently decided that such niceties as character development and psychological and even physical probability weren't really necessary.  Even given the context of a 300-foot monster smashing Manhattan, I found the characters' actions in rescuing a damsel in distress to be highly unlikely.  And who are these kids, anyway?  Some reviewers said that they were so obnoxious by the end of the movie the reviewers were rooting for the monster to eat all of them.  I wouldn't go that far.

I would consider the first viewing to be NUMBING.  I choose this word carefully.  The filmmakers are consciously referencing 9/11, and viewed through that lens, I found the plot to be representative of the human need to come to grips with that horrible event--the rescue narrative, which can be easily dismissed as romantic drivel, to me reads as the poetic expression of the human need to say the things that tragedy prevented us from saying.

The complaints about the way the film is shot--with the handy cam--are valid and fair.  I was not bothered by them.

Finally, I will say this for the film.  Yes, when I saw it in theaters, it felt uninvolving.  However, it was also haunting.  There was something about it that I felt compelled to come back to.  I have now seen it three times.  The more I see it, the more I see INTO it.  I think seeing this movie once and dismissing it is a mistake.",1214179200,101,1046,4.442105263157894

The movie starts out as a group of friends throw a party for Rob, who is going away to Japan (nice nod to the country that gave us Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman, amongst others). About twenty minutes into the film, some THING happens and from that point on it becomes about trying to escape New York city while a giant monster runs amok. Hudd, one of the main characters, decides to document the whole thing on the camcorder, which winds up getting spliced in with the existing material on the tape. The end result is pretty interesting... sort of the natural progression from the 'Blair Witch Project,' except with a little (or maybe alot) more meat on it's bones. The ending was great too... I'm not going to spoil it anymore than that, but I liked it.

The story is very well done, I thought, focusing as much on the fact that theres a huge prehistoric monster rampaging through the streets of New York as it does on the characters, their relationships and their attempts to flee the city to safety. Despite what some people have said, we do get more than a few glimpses of the monster - in fact, it looks sort of like.. oh, I don't know, a multi-limbed reptilian-ape hybrid - but it is left mysterious. Nothing is really ever explained about the monster. Did it come up from the deep? Is it from outerspace? Was it a government experiment? Thats up to the viewers to decide. The makers of the film made a brilliant move in doing so, because keeping us in the dark makes the monster much more scary and unknown. And infinitely cooler in my opinion. However one clue MIGHT be seen off in the distance if you look very closely at the end.

Now, as for the special features, they were okay but not great. The deleted scenes, outtakes and two alternate endings were interesting, though they didn't add much. And I prefer the ending they went with over either of the slight variations. The other special features, like the making of and especially the little featurette about the monster... those were much better. It was especially neat to go back and watch the movie after learning some of the details about the monster, because it made the beast's actions that much more interesting. And, it also made you feel more sympathetic for the creature too. But I won't say much beyond that.

Over all, it was a great movie. The pacing of the action was very good, the monster was awesome (which you need for a movie like this), and the storyline, while similar to other giant monster flicks, was given a unique new spin. Quite innovative. The character of Hudd made an enjoyable, even sympathetic, narrator, and the woman playing Marlena (his crush) did a fun job in her role too. And it really winds up feeling like its an amateur blogger doing a home movie documenting some huge world-changing event. So kudos to the makers of Cloverfield. It REALLY is a cool new twist on giant monster movies, and worth seeing a couple times to take in everything. I liked it and strongly recommend it.",1214006400,8,3380,4.527004909983633
1586518,5,B00005JPXY,"We all know of the hype that surrounded this film and that was even before we even knew the name of the film, once we found out the name we became more pre-occupied with the Monster but we never really got to see the monster up close and personal. Even when the movie was released we're never really given a clear shot of the monster itself leaving more to the imagination, which I think makes it all the more special. The story tells of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) who's about to leave New York city to start a new life in Japan, during his goodbye party he has an argument with his girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman) and she leaves while he has to attend the party with other things on his mind. By about this time the cameraman for the movie is Hud. (T.J. Miller) As the night progresses the party is shaken by an almighty roar for which they suspect may be an earthquake but after a news report we come to learn it's something so much more frightening.

There have been many complaints about the concept of the movie being Blair Witch-esque and being shot entirely by a handheld camera, but let me be honest when I say that it makes it all the more realistic and even more frightening. This is definitely a monster movie on the scale of the 1998 Godzilla but with one huge difference... OK maybe two and they are, we know nothing about the monster or where it comes from and we don't really come to know what it looks like. This is definitely big budget and the first scene in which the monster first attacks the city gives us the frightening vibe of the 9/11 attacks and the hysteria that the people felt at that time.

If the initial attack and the monster itself wasn't enough to scare the life out of you, then the little creatures that fall off the monster are seriously something to make you wet your pants with fright. They have the cringe factor of a very large spider, they're fast, they're crazy and if they bite you, you explode. We're never given any explanation about what's going on with the monster or the little creatures, we never find out why the people explode and indeed whether something in the Alien movie fashion jumps out. The lack of information we're given is really something that makes the whole film special as the less you know, the more your mind starts to play tricks and the more you start to think ""well maybe this is what happens, or maybe that's it"" you just don't know and that's what makes it an incredible film going experience.

This is something that you really should try, don't be put off by the wimpy claims of motion sickness or the pathetic ramblings of not being able to see much and the camera always swerving away from the best bit, as that's the point. It's more a movie for your imagination and let me tell you your mind really does play tricks. There is a sequel on the way and we have no idea how this is going to turn out, whether this will be a typical movie sequel or whether this will be another video camera movie from another point of view. The soldiers had cameras on their helmets so it's possible that the sequel may be from a soldiers point of view, I know I can't wait for the sequel but if you have yet to see the first movie, you really should try it out.",1214006400,4,3230,4.344370860927152

1586522,5,B00005JPXY,"First, the camera work did not make me sick..  Maybe it's because I play video games.  It did not make my husband sick.  He does not play video games.

Second, for those who have complained about the acting, I say ""who cares?""  I think the fact that these people were acting like you or I was a good idea in that it was an amateur filming the whole event.

Third, I was very impressed with the lack of monster sightings.  Normally, the monster is seen way too much.  The film had a creepiness to it that I could appreciate because I love being creeped out!  Then, when you do finally see Clover, it's really gross!  The way its arms look alone just made me shudder.

Fourth, if you watch the extras on the DVD, you will be amazed at how much of the movie was CGI.  I'm very critical of this kind of thing.  For instance, I'm appalled at the newer Godzilla flicks and the bad CGI.  Stick with the rubbermonster suits, guys.

Now, I do find a couple of things I did not like:  Marlena's and Beth's injuries were quite severe, yet they both were able to just walk around like normal!  And in high heels, no less!  Quite silly.  And the poor, sad image of the horse pulling its Central Park carriage through the streets so slowly.

The only good thing this movie had going for it were the special effects. The action shots were few and far between, and it dragged on in places, especially throughout the first hour. I felt like I was watching the Ferris Bueller remake of Godzilla from the standpoint of the people being squashed in the street.

If I had seen this in the theater, I would have walked out. The largest complaint I have read about this movie is the shaky hand-held camera movements. I didn't have a problem with that. What really bothered me was the lack of anything happening.",1213833600,6,717,4.515384615384615
1586526,5,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield takes a fairly unoriginal plot, mashes it together with an excellent cast of (mostly) Hollywood nobodies, and allows us, the viewers, to watch through the video camera of Hudson Platt.

I loved the way this film was done. The same shaking camera that made a lot of people dizzy just made the movie seem all the more real to me. If anything, the first person filming style personalized the movie for me (rather than making me sick, as other reviewers have claimed. I never felt dizzy or nauseous at all while watching Cloverfield, but maybe that's just me) and made it easier to relate to the characters' pain. Also, the monster was totally awesome!

This is an instant monster-movie classic in my book. I would advise renting it first rather than going out and buying it though, just in case you're one of those people who get sick while watching it.",1213747200,7,862,4.6644736842105265

1586609,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield, for me, is one of the most intriguing films I've seen in a long time. And if I hear one more person whine about how they got sick because of the hand held video. Have you been to the movies lately? There's a lot of hand held/quick edit work being done. But IN THIS CONTEXT it works. It really does feel like a documentation of an actual event. And to debunk another criticism....that all the actors are the same age, same style of dress and talk....uh, they're friends at a party. Ever notice that your friends kinda look and talk like you more or less? Good grief. Now on to the movie. Just when you're ready for the s**t to hit the fan, it does. And it happens in the distance, you don't see the initial impact, and when you do see the first explosions, they are way off in the distance. Brilliant. Again, against the typical norms for this kind of movie, and it made it real for me. And it is pure genius to hold out on showing the creature too much. Part of what made the original JAWS so great was the restraint in showing the shark. It makes the few times you do see it all the more terrifying.

So don't let the bogus criticisms scare you off. This is a wildly entertaining movie. Find a friend with a big TV though. Best enjoyed on a big screen.",1213747200,9,1266,4.209876543209877
1586610,4,B00005JPXY,"As with many of JJ Abrams bodies of work, Cloverfield is much more than just a movie but you need not participate in the online Alternate Reality Game, series of comics, and so on. The reason you not get involved in all that, fun as it may be, is because the film itself is the closest thing to a Midtown Manhattan roller coaster I've seen yet.

Just like the old wooden coasters, the movie starts out with an almost overbearing handheld video of a going away party. It's as if you're waiting for the rest of the riders to get seated and buckled in. Then, the lights go out.

For the rest of the film and without a single break, you are following a handful of party goers running for their lives to survive events they can't comprehend until they see for themselves that a skyscraper crushing beast has decided to visit the big apple.

As if the single monster wasn't enough, it brought along some smaller friends who wind up being deadly hunters capable of tearing you apart and even if you survive with just a bite, they leave you with a final surprise.

I highly recommend this movie and, if you have the time and interest, checking out the side story and online game because it opens up many interesting questions, quite like fans of Lost wind up asking at the end of every season. You've probably heard about the handheld camera work and though it can be as irritating as a home movie if you let it, the purpose is to immerse you into the lives of fleeing residents in a way which makes the film both haunting and exciting.

The special effects are good and CGI integrates seamlessly with the film. Casting is okay, no big names, but a mixed bag of some very talented actors and actresses as well as a few who are no doubt destined to land roles in a B-movie or two before disappearing altogether.",1213660800,,1802,4.3993993993994

1586613,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield was and is a brilliant idea for a film, and the film as it exists is a damn fun ride. I really enjoyed it with only two spoiler-ish complaints, one small, and one as big as the ""terrible thing"" itself. First off, the little one. As I mentioned before, the film feels like a ride at a theme park, and in my opinion, a really fun one too. However, the movie's tone changes completely within the last 10 minutes. It's like JJ Abrams came in and told them to add some gravitas or something, so they half hazzardly tacked on an unfitting tragic ending in hopes of getting some kind of recognition as a drama, as well as a monster movie.
As it is, the end kind of feels like you're having a friendly, high spirited arm-wrestling match, and then your opponent randomly punches you in the face and declares victory. It's like, ""Jeez, I know you wanted to win and everything, but was that really necessary? I thought we were just having fun.""
My big issue with Cloverfield, though, is a little less concrete. Like I said, I liked the film, I was way into the hype, and I think the concept behind the film is brilliant. But that's the thing. Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams had this great, clever, inventive concept of a ""handycam-monster-movie"", but failed to execute that idea for all it it was worth. Abrams has indicated as much in interviews, talking about the intersection of two different people with cameras on the bridge during the film, and how that concept might play out in a sequel. Why a sequel? Why didn't it happen HERE, dammit?! Why didn't we switch from one party's camera to the other? Why didn't anyone else besides Hud shoot footage? A lot of people, I know, felt alienated by the lack of backstory on the monster attack. How great would it have been if, at some point in the film, Hud handed the camera off to one of the Military guys, and they proceded to document more info on what the hell was actually going on? Why didn't the camera make it out of New York, to see what was going on elsewhere? Cameras don't die, as long as its battery doesn't die and it doesn't get fubarred, it can tell stories, and with this film, a camera-as-narrator approach would have been revolutionary. But they played it safe. Boo.
Anyway, watch Cloverfield, buy the DVD, it's certainly worth the used price, at least. It's really good. It's just not as GREAT as it could have been.",1213401600,3,2382,4.465596330275229
1586614,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield's got a lot of heat from viewers because they said the camera made them dizzy. Some also said a lot of things were not explained. Here's my 2+2 cents on Cloverfield. Well, I just finished watching the dvd and I must say I'm amazed. For the idea of Cloverfield alone, the film should get a lot of recognition. I liked this more than I liked 28 Days later and the sequel. This is modern cinema at it's best. I loved the characters esp the person who's taking the video. He stayed true to his character and not so much the drama element involved in tragedies. (""no camcorder advertising"" was done)

Cloverfield a huge risk taken by the film-makers and I must say naysayers can whine for all their mouth but Cloverfield shuts everyone up and delivers. Another thing I loved about the film is that it's barely 80 minutes you know. I read so many negative reviews of this film but I must say the film is truly one of the better films I've seen in 2008. In 2010, when I'm watching 2008 films, I will still look back at this film and say Wow.

If you liked War of the Worlds, there is no way you can dislike this. It doesn't even have that irritating little girl screaming her mouth off. It has rats running for shelter, it has bridges collapsing, it has fire, it has sky, F16s, honest believable humor and flirting skills, it has 6.42 AM and mineral water.

1586683,1,B00005JPXY,"You'll root for the monster.

Created by the people who scared the bejeezus out of audiences with the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield rehashes the same idea (unseen/glimpsed menace+scared people+video camera=movie) almost without adaptation except that here, the menace part is taken care of by a thirty-storey Godzilla-knock-off that wanders around Manhattan for a bit monster tourism: It eats people; it breaks stuff and it magically appears whenever the plot goes from thin to laughable.

Filmed from the viewpoint of someone who barely understoods how to work the camcorder, Cloverfield is shot in a 'naturalistic' way that requires you to believe that someone will hang onto and use a camcorder through bridge collapses, military counterattacks and being chewed by Doberman-sized monster-fleas.

It starts at a loft party, which the plot rapidly pares down to four upscale twenty-somethings with whom the average moviegoer shares nothing whatsoever and who are so shallow, and/or so stupid that you quickly miss the point of anyone's wanting to save them; leaving the only point of interest in the movie how quickly the monster will come and put them out of *your* misery and minus plot-sense or sympathetic characters, you quickly find yourself rooting for the monster; because the monster at least is interesting.

For all intents and purposes, the Blair Witch Project, created a genre a new and independent 'type' of movie with its own characteristics, but it is one that Cloverfield makes you want to see the end of because what comes out of it in terms of plot isn't hopeful, or natural, or uplifting or exciting in any way that is surprisingly or even believably resolved.

There are reasons to make movies this way but none of them treat the audience like a friend that they like. The advantage to a director or to a studio of making movies 'Blair Witch style' is that you don't need writers to make them; all you have to do is to find some talented actors and tell them, 'okay, you're really, really scared because of *topic*'.' and point a camera at them. The main weakness of this idea is that you can only make one of these movies (the Blair Witch Project itself) before everyone knows the magic trick and all the reasons why you should keep writing talent around become obvious.

You don't need writers to make a movie like Cloverfield: you need them to make a movie like Cloverfield good.",1213228800,5,2407,4.930864197530864
1586684,3,B00005JPXY,"The biggest problem I had with this movie is, unfortunately, unfixable.  Because the entire premise hinges on the style in which it was shot - a style that wrecks havoc with my motion-sickness.  I spent only half the movie really watching the screen, and had to rewind to see the interesting bits, and still ended up with a nagging headache and an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.  And the crushingly disappointing thing is that I really liked the premise of the movie!  There wasn't a huge amount of gore, the fact that there were mere glimpses of the monster was well-done in a very old-fashioned (and in my opinion, far better) way, and the rather open ending was, although predictable from the opening credits, still the best possible wrap-up to the story.

The acting could have been better.  It seemed a little flat and unbelievable at points, and a few of the characters grated on my nerves.  And, of course, the entire movie was completely unbelievable.  I can't say much specifically without giving away the plot (and I dislike it when people do that!) but I will say the resistance to weapons by the monster and the words and actions of the military personnel didn't ring at all true.  But then, it is a horror film, so I'll grudgingly half-accept some of it as part of my suspension of disbelief.

However, if you're a person who likes answers and plots wrapped up in tidy little packages, this is not the movie for you.  Nothing is really explained.  There are so many open questions left for the viewer to fill in any way they see fit.  Anyone who enjoys that in a movie will have a field day with this one, those who don't will be nothing but frustrated.

I'd say get a group together and pack the Dramamine - it's a good Friday night creature flick.  And more than half the fun will be talking about it afterwards.",1213228800,2,1837,4.507552870090635

I think that this was a great movie. I loved the whole 'civilians point of view thing.' A lot of people complain about the camera and how nauseating it is, or how it movies all over the place and how it looks like a home movie. Well, I hate to break it to you, but the reason why it's like that is because it is. The whole point of the movie was to film it from a civilian's point of view. If it was from everyone's point of view, then it would've been done professionally. But the whole point of the movie was that the camera was supposed to look like someone was running around and making a home-movie.

I thought that everything about this movie was great. Even the beginning where it was talking about everyone's lives. I thought that was great too. Although it is a little lengthy, if you think about it, it kind of needs to be done. You have to establish a bond between the characters and the viewers. Let's face it, nobody's really gonna pay attention to the movie unless they like the characters. If it started off with blood and guts then it would be pretty boring. But if you like a certain character and don't want to see them die, you'll find yourself paying attention and enjoying the movie even more just because of a bond you have with a certain character.

Also a lot of people complain that you don't get to see certain things happen in this movie. Uhh... that's the whole point... again! It's from a civilian's point of view. I'm sorry, but if someone gets shot in the middle of the street, the police aren't exactly going to let you run into the middle of the crime scene and inspect everything.

This Blu-Ray edition has a lot of great features that go in-depth with the story-line and explain everything. The only reason I gave it four stars was because although I found the beginning necessary, it was a little lengthy.",1213142400,3,2005,4.381720430107527

1586751,5,B00005JPXY,"I was reading all the bad reviews, and I have to say... I just don't think those who hated it got it.  This movie is innovative, even beyond ""Blair Witch"", because it wasn't exactly scripted.  The whole point of this movie is, basically, ""what would you do in a disaster of this magnitude?""

Most monster movies are scripted and acted, and while this falls in our comfort zone, it isn't realistic.  Cloverfield was realistic.

Okay, not realistic in that a giant monster is attacking New York.  It's realistic in how it's shot, and how it's experienced.  We're not seeing it through the eyes of a filmmaker and crew.  We're seeing it through the eyes of the people who are experiencing it.  The best way I can describe it is, chances are, if this had actually happened, that is exactly what we'd be seeing on the news.  Remember amateur videos of 9/11?  That's the ""technique"" that was strived for, here.

Some are calling it out for having Rob go after his girlfriend and his friends following.  First off, there are some people in this world who would go after someone to try and save them in a crisis.  I know, if something similar happened, and someone I really cared about was trapped, I'd go after them.  I did once, in a serious Tornado (F5).  Crossed paths with it many times.  But we both made it out just fine.  So it isn't unrealistic.  Plus, Rob's friends chose to go with him.  They didn't have to, and he even told them not to.  But you have to think about this.  Somehow, the story had to be told.  Rob and his friends going after Beth was a great way to set up telling the story.  Because, let's be realistic... the story-telling device of any movie or TV show ever made is never that great.  Look at the 80's TV Show ""Murder, She Wrote.""  Some people don't understand how murder ""follows"" Jessica.  But if it didn't, then there wouldn't be a story for each episode, now would there?  It's exactly the same.  If Rob and his friends had just evacuated, then there wouldn't have been a story to tell from this point-of-view.",1213142400,5,2038,4.476839237057221
1586752,2,B00005JPXY,"I knew a hand-held camera was used for this film, but I still was not prepared for the jerky, off-center camera work. Getting old. For me, it was impossible to get to know or care about those involved. The party was
confusion; with too much noise to understand most of the dialogue. Once the creature(s) showed up, though, it did get better.

The mobilization of Army/Airforce units, seemed very quick but the actual combats scenes seemed authentic. (Maybe the chaos started a lot sooner than we know). The creature was just strange enough, to be unique. It seemed as frightened as the people.(No idea where it came from). As you can tell, I didn't really care what happened to people. And I was hoping for the crusading scientist, to give us some Creature Biology lessons.

1586753,5,B00005JPXY,"Say what you will about Cloverfield's ""shaky cam"" technique, but this film utlizies the style to great effect. Billed as salvaged government footage, the movie follows a group of people in new york, when it is suddenly attacked by a giant monster. What I like about that idea is the fact that you don't even get a good look at the creature until about half-way through the movie; and every time you do glimps it, the monster looks weirder and more bizare--this keeps the audience guessing. Then there are other surprises as well that I won't reveal, but let's just say that this is the most creative giant monster movie I've ever seen. They actually thought it through and presented the creature as something that could potentially exist in nature.

The characters are believable and we empathize with them. My only real quirk is that the camera guy is often the comic relief and he comes off as extremely annoying at times. Also, some of the decisions they make and the plot points in the movie seem just a little far-fetched. That, and the ending might cause some people dislike this movie.

Otherwise, Cloverfield is a genuinely scary movie. I have seen plenty of horror films, new and classic, from Tetsuo the Iron Man to the Texas Chainsaw remake. So it's very difficult to scare me. But I saw this in theaters and it actually made me scream--twice! If you're looking for a horror/drama that is unique and reinvents old genres, then I highly recommend Cloverfield.",1213056000,6,1469,4.734375

1586756,3,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is an entertaining addition to the ""creature is attacking the city"" sci-fi/horror genre, but it is difficult to take it very seriously at all.

The concept is promisingly ominous: a group of ordinary people (they aren't though: each and every one of them is a Gap ad, an ""I'm Too Hip To Be At This Party"" stereotype) who happened to be recording a friend's departure to Japan (hint hint) on camcorder when, without warning, a terrible catastrophe strikes: a creature of some sort begins demolishing New York City.

The chief problem with this is that we cannot believe in any of the characters, not for one second: they are the mediated archetypes of youth.  Hud (T.J. Miller) is the most sympathetic character: he has no pretensions and simply runs through the film trying to keep the ""hero"" (Michael Stahl-David) Rob Hawkins from making the most irresponsible decisions possible, which he does anyway.  The creepiest and most effective part of the film, in my opinion, is when the silent but mysterious type, Marlena, is bitten by one of the nasty critters spawned by the hulking hydra which thrashes at the center of civilization: she walks onto camera and says simply: ""I don't feel good..."".  Then, something beyond comprehension occurs.

The ending is both saccharine, corny, and very effective on the monster side of things: poor Hud makes an unwise decision, after miraculously surviving a full force plane crash with Rob and his irritating Juliet (the whole love story disrupts the mood of Lovecraftian dread, and is the chief flaw of the film) to look straight in the face of the monster: wow, is it ugly.

Films like this--missed opportunities for greatness--awaken the desire in me for some imaginary film board that restricts great new concepts to great filmmakers.  Still, a novelty worth giving a look.",1213056000,6,1831,4.980327868852459
1586757,5,B00005JPXY,"I was first exposed to Cloverfield at the theater previews, where my first reaction was, ""Looks like a Blair Witch rip-off where people run around scared for two hours screaming with a hand held camera, only to be disappointed when the monster is not even revealed or shown."" Because of my mistaken first impression, and because I didn't want to throw up, I refused to see the movie at the theatres and wanted to hate it. So when I finally did see it on pay per view, I was expecting a retarded movie. But I was pleasently suprised. The first hour of suspensful buildup never became boring (to me anyways), and when the creature was finally revealed, it was intenese and well worth the wait. The huge creature destroying New York was shown enough to be interesting , but not overdone to where it lost it's intensity or power. During the beginning I was thinking if I saw the movie in the theaters, I'd hate the motion of the camera, but by the end of the movie, I was thinking it may have been worth throwing up just to see the monster's destruction and massiveness on a larger then life big screen.
Earlier, I compared it to Blair Witch Project, which I despised. But who knows, if Blair Witch had a budget and effects and well designed creatures like Cloverfield, it may have had an enjoyable climax like Cloverfield. This critic will buy the DVD.",1212969600,5,1349,4.510204081632653
1586758,4,B00005JPXY,"I loved this movie.  Very interesting and the ""monster"" in it was super creepy looking.  You never find out what it is or where it came from, just that it can't be destroyed, at least by conventional methods.  No conclusion to the film really either.  But god it's fun to watch.  Better than ""I Am Legend"" in my opinion.

For those who have complaints about this film.  First, I have Meniere's disease (extreme vertigo) and I didn't have a problem watching this movie.  And if I can watch it without getting sick or dizzy, then the average Joe should be able to as well.  Second, about the beginning being boring.  Yeah, it's not an action-packed film right from the opening scene, but you've got to give the reader a backstory to get them interested and vested in the characters so you care about what happens to them.  If you didn't know why would you care?

I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because I think that the average movie goer would want some kind of conclusion or resolution to the film.  Like were they able to kill the monster, is there any chance of survival after the bombing, what did NYC look like when it was all said and done, etc.  My guess is they may have left it open perhaps for a sequel of some sort.
Another reason to not give a full 5 stars is that when I first saw it I thought ""Blair Witch"" through the whole thing.  Very ""Blair Witch"" as far as film style.  It's just been done before that's all.

Overall I think it'll be a cult classic hit - lots of people won't like this movie, but lots will and that will make it do very well overall.  We just got a PS3 and I can't wait to watch this movie on Blu-Ray with our 1080p big screen TV.  It should be even more amazing!",1212969600,3,1694,4.188854489164087
1586759,3,B00005JPXY,"This was a hard movie to watch but I liked it. What that means is I liked the acting, the story, and effects, but I wanted to slap someone silly that thought filming it as a everyone has one portable handheld camera so that makes it ""REAL"". I don't like ""The Blair Witch Project"" for the same reason. If I want to watch home movies I can pull my own out. Come to think of it I have never  seen any home movies where it looked like they purposely played catch, drop, and spin with their camera when filming. Even the worst amateurs can do a better job. So sorry the ""amateur"" angle doesn't fly. We don't plop down $9 plus to see it in a theater or $15 plus to get the DVD so we can watch the absolute worst in amateur photography. My wife wouldn't watch after about five minutes as the camera moving all over made her sick to the stomach.

I had alot of trouble myself and had to look away regularly even though I wanted to watch. Now as a person that has filmed movies for years, if you want to do this nonsense because ""YOU"" think it's edgy or something please get someone that at least can hold the camera right, any mom or dad off the street namely. They have lots more experience than the camera person in this movie, that or the director told them to make this movie this way so people would hurl alot. So once again I loved the movie, just not how it was filmed. Had they held the camera still more I would have given it four and a half stars. Go to any of the web sites sporting amateur videos and you will see they are filmed far superior to this movie. And they unlike this movie are in fact edgy and cutting edge ideas in camera work.

1586824,5,B00005JPXY,"The premise and plot of this movie are really surprisingly simple: think of a Godzilla movie from the human victims' point of view, and set it in New York.  This movie avoids many common Hollywood disorders:  There are no big name actors.  Special effects are used appropriately.  The ""camcorder perspective"" generates a very genuine, intimate feel.  The main characters (just average people) do not pick up over-sized weapons and take on the ""monster"".  There is no pointless over-explanation about what attacked the city.

In short, I found this movie to be good fun.  Along with the suspense and action one would expect from this sort of film, characters were developed enough for them to have believable motivations and for the audience to care.

Many have complained that there was too much camera shake in this film.  Though I thought it was over-done, I am quite surprised by claims that people have become nauseated watching this movie.

1586827,5,B00005JPXY,"I saw Cloverfield with some trepidation--I was aware of the bad reviews, and I hate bad horror films, but I love good ones so I thought I'd take a chance.  And despite all the bad reviews, I'm glad I did, for Cloverfield is the perfect monster movie.  Is it confusing and badly explained?  Absolutely--but just remember how confusing 9/11 was, even if you were not caught up in the midst of it.  What Cloverfield does so well, that so few movies even try--horror or not, is to put us, the viewer, right in the middle of the action.  We are not an invisible, omniscient watcher, we are as much as possible a participant, in the character of Hud (most of the time) who carries a video camera through the action.  Sure, it's been done before--Blair Witch Project--and to much criticism then, too.  Some people just want their movies told in the traditional format.  But to be made to FEEL what it might be like to be in these events, you just can't do that.  Perhaps it was Steven King (in his story The Mist) who first realised that the people on the ground are too busy fighting for their lives to care much where the monster comes from--and also that if a monster appears, it might not be obvious at all where it comes from anyway.  We, as the audience, naturally want to know, but that's where Cloverfield breaks from tradition (as did Blair Witch)--that knowledge is no more forthcoming to us than it is to Hud and his friends--because we ARE Hud and his friends.  And if you wonder how Hud could be looking through the viewfinder all the time, he isn't--early on the camera is transfered and there is clearly a strap that holds the thing around waist level--which is why some of the shots focus on peoples legs and feet rather than their faces.

But Cloverfield does follow some horror monster traditions, and to great effect, especially those concerning pacing and the reveal.  The pacing (in spite of certain reviewer's comments who simply seem to have forgotten the quiet moments, as one naturally does--but they are there) is beautifully handled.  At the point when you're wondering if you actually went to the right theater, the monster strikes, and then events build to a climax, with a brief glimpse of the monster, and settle back down.  The movie continues cresting and ebbing like a series of ever more horrifying waves, always maintaining some aspect of mystery about the creature's appearance until the final minutes of the film.  And it's a glorious monster, too--knobby and hideous and alien, pretty clearly inspired by the idea of a wingless bat but unlike anything I've really seen before.  I don't buy it as an undersea creature myself--anything that big that lived in the ocean wouldn't have the musculature or skeletal structure to stand on land, much less withstand aerial bombing--but of course, that's not the point, it's not real anyway.

Those who quibble about the acting and characterizations and the two day growth of beard puzzle me--sure, not everyone lets their beard grow over the weekend, but plenty do.  The actors were superb in their parts, and even the main character, who had the most difficult selling job--going back toward the monster to rescue his girlfriend rather than escaping--showed just the right amount of conviction for his cause mixed with understanding and concern for his friends' situation.

Admittedly, Cloverfield isn't for everyone--if you hated the narrative style or camerawork of Blair Witch, then definitely save your money.  But if the shock of Alien made you think that's the standard which horror should aspire, then rush out and get Cloverfield now.  You'll have a good day.",1212624000,8,3641,4.810593900481541
1586828,4,B00005JPXY,"*** IMPORTANT MESSAGE ***
The origin of the Cloverfield monster is indeed hinted at,
during the  final scene of the film!!
The scene where the two main-characters are on the ferris wheel.
Before the camera pans to the girlfriend, it's shooting the ocean horizon,
If you look closely (of if your television is the size of a space-station) you'll notice a comet/meteorite/satelite/something crash into the ocean in the distance.
I've extensively debated the point of origin (space or the ocean)on the horror forums,
and so far all signs could point to either.
(I personally believe it came from space,
because scientificly, the ocean wouldnt make sense.)
Here's why I believe this:
1. A satelite/whatever only now disturbing something that huge is implausible,
as underwater eartquakes would have disturbed it millenia ago.
2. Any earth-based creature breathes either air or water, has either lungs or gils, not both,
and the creature from Cloverfield was clearly breathing air,
which implies that it would eventually have to surface for oxygen.
And something that huge would be nearly impossible to miss once it surfaced.
3. There would have to be multiple creatures, for activities like...I don't know...reproduction.
Making their presence all the more obvious.
4. Not to mention that EVERYTHING that comes from the ocean requires fins, while this creature was clearly walking around on giant legs, a trait common to land creatures.
5. An alien origin would nullify any earth-based logic.

That being said:
The movie's characters are soo believable,
and you get so immersed in their initial conflict that you forget you're about to watch a monster flick.
The shaky handi-cam adds to the realism, as does the lack of creature footage.
You see it, but you only get a vague sense of what it looks like.
You do however get a much better sense of what the spider-like flea-creatures that come off the behemoth look like,
though again, you only get a vague sense of how their bites work.
The character that is bit, is quickly ushered away before you get to see the outcome of the obvious infection.
It was a really good monster flick, but it definitely felt incomplete.
I know there's gonna be 2 more movies from different angles,
and knowing that makes this one seem all the better.
But all in all, very enjoyable.

1) The Cloverfield monster is the Id Monster from the 50s sci-fi classic Forbidden Planet (neat!)--gives one a lot to think about

2) The ""shaky cam"" is a novel way of introducing very imaginative and symbol-laden camera-work all while making it seem ""natural"" (to at least a 21st Century person). Nothing in this film is unplanned or random, including the white noise, jump cuts, and frequent visual chaos

3) I hope everyone saw the ""thing"" splash into the sea during the last flashback; the characters are so self-involved they don't even notice.

4)The whole film is greater than the sum of its parts and hits hard at a lot of contemporary culture and the modern mind-set. It's not about 9-11, it's about the national head-state.

5) Watch this with Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" and the first half hour of ""Saving Private Ryan""--don't forget to watch Forbidden Planet too. Add in the much maligned ""Southland Tales""--another great 9-11 film.

5) One of the sharpest flicks I've seen in a long time--almost an art film

6) Showed this to an interesting pack of people and they all thought it was a work of genius

Oh, Godzilla came out in 1954, nine years after the atomic bombings of Japan--this came out roughly seven years after 9-11. The movie is a fascinating take (or re-take) on the Godzilla fad as a social-psychological phenomenon. Our monster is just a lot more irrational.

Cloverfield is not terrifying. I was not on the edge of my seat. I did not care about the characters. The monsters were not very frightening. It lacks intensity.
Cloverfield is not worth your time or money. The whole beginning of the film is worthless. They wait way too long to bring in the monsters. There's this big part about this guy's girlfriend that is boring and you will not care about that takes up a long time. That beginning part should be introducing you to the characters and making you care about what happens to them, but it is not effective in doing that at all.

As if global warming and terrorism wasn't enough.  ""Cloverfield"" is the military designation codename for an ""LSA"" or ""Large Scale Agressor"" scenario.  The film plays as a firsthand eyewitness video account of a Godzilla-type monster on shore leave in NYC.

If you can suspend the disbelief that no one in their right mind would continue to videotape while smack dab in the middle of such an unbelievablably monumental catastrophe, your enjoyment of this film might increase by a few marginal points.  The hand-held video camera style photography lends a realistic credibility to the proceedings but does nothing to promote any sharp picture resolution.  To me, the notion of rendering this movie in 1080p High Definition makes about as much sense as gold-plating one's toilet bowl.  You'll have the prettiest crapper on the block but so what?  The HD picture only serves to further augment the grainy pixilated imagery so common with low-grade digital video.

Don't get me wrong, the sub-par picture resolution does nothing to diminish the film's ambitious production value.  The 5.1 Dolby True HD surround sound is a revelation.  Crank the volume on this one.  Your neighbors will love you for it.

This DVD is loaded with extras, all presented in HD as well: Director audio commentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, alternate endings, Easter eggs, and three featurettes covering production, visual effects and creature design.  But exclusive to the blu-ray edition is the most impressive feature of all: a Special Investigation Mode which allows you to watch the film with pop-up military intel that gives you background on the creature and the people involved, along with a GPS map of Manhattan which shows you exactly where the creature is in relation to the protagonists and the action taking place on the screen.

This is an all-together solid package but I can't recommend it if you already own the regular DVD version.  For the enterprising filmmaker or digital effects artist, this DVD offers an insightful look into the filmmaking process.",1212537600,2,2200,5.086350974930362

In your typical shoot-em-ups, the hero saves the world from impending doom while maximizing collateral damage to the bad guys. Wow, shocker.

Chick-flicks are dramas where the guy gets the girl in the end.

Scary movies have moments that might creep you out, plenty of things jumping out at you and maybe some ghouls mixed in for good measure, but its still cheap thrills in the end.

Finally, comedies are just some cute way to fit a stand-up routine in with somewhat of a story.

Cloverfield, however, does not fit into any of these categories. It's a refreshing new way to communicate a simple message in a realistic kind of way. The most interesting part is the realism of the movie (save the one leap of logic: the giant monster rampaging through New York). Sure, the government would get involved, and sure, the resulting actions are all logical and probably what would really happen. Interesting movie and worth the investment to see a couple of times.",1212537600,3,1233,4.76056338028169

As one reviewer said, some of the special effects were great, but what's with the hand held camera effect?  ""Blair Witch"" had the same annoying effects, but compared with Cloverfield ... it was still frame!

Where did the monster come from?  Where did it go?  Lots of room for a sequal, but who would ever go see a sequal to this really bad movie?",1212451200,5,465,4.337209302325581

Some people see that as an asset, others want the camera to be steady or for everything to be explained, etc. It's made clear from the very beginning that what we are looking at is supposed to be ""found footage"" and not professionally produced. I think the makers of the film were very clever in the way they conceived Cloverfield and put it together. But the negative responses prove that the easiest way to please as many people as possible is to give them the same old thing that they're already used to.

I'm especially surprised at people who don't like the ending. The ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, but if you really understand what is happening at the end, it makes PERFECT sense.

Yes, the camera was constantly shaking and many scenes had to be followed extremely closely - but the overall effect of the movie was breathtaking.

The first 20 mins was a pain but (just like the Deer Hunter to be fair) it set up the rest of the movie perfectly. I can't remember seeing so many clever ideas and creative concepts thrown at the camera in such a short period of time, amazing. And well done to the writer/producer/director for having the guts and skill to get this cut past the studio without 'explaining' every last single detail - the answers are there if you look closely enough (spoiler... ish  watch the end scene at Coney Island VERY carefully).

My only moan would be the monster seemed to be stalking the lead actor relentlessly out of every person that happened to be in Manhattan - but on the overall scale of things a minor gripe in what was one of the most satisfying movies I've seen in ages.",1212278400,5,987,4.466666666666667
1586948,2,B00005JPXY,"On the surface, this film sounds like a great idea, if trying to be innovative and original.  But, as it plays out, it is not very appealing to watch.  And not just because it's shaky, but because there really is no written story.  It plays out as if it's just something that got captured on an amateur video recorder.  It has us sit through about nearly 20 minutes of  a casual party scene in someone's apartment which is boring as hell even for only 20 minutes.  Finally, the element of shock kicks in and the non-reality finally comes into play. Suddenly, there are monsters in the street and everyone is scared for their lives.  Even the guy with the camcorder seems to think it's more important to keep the video camera running, than to save his own butt which would represent more of a reality in its truest sense.

And just like ""The Blair Witch Project"", a raw looking camcorder based film is sickening to watch on the big screen.  And when it's all over, who would want to watch it again?  Once the ""shock factor"" has passed, the film can no longer be interesting, if it was at all.  You're not going to be shocked again so that one thrill that was there will be lost forevermore.

The blair witch camera angles are my first complaint, the acting was even worse, and the story was so bad it made me want to watch a Uwe Boll film.  I will say that the monster was pretty cool looking and that was the only positive thing about the movie. Let me tell you all the bad things about the movie, first the monster appears out of nowhere and you don't find out where it came from.  The story was so bad, one of the brothers sleeps with a girl before he is going to leave for Japan for a new job.  They have a fight at his going away party and leaves with another guy.  So the monster appears and creates havoc through out the city, so everyone is crossing the brooklyn bridge to escape the monster and he receives a phone from Beth (the girl that he slept with and had a fight with at his going away party) saying that she is traped and needs help.  Right after the phone call the monsters tail knocks out the bridge and kills his brother.  After seeing his brother die guess what he does?  He tells his remaining friends that he has to go find Beth.  So his best friend, his brothers girl friend and some other chick all go with him to save his booty call.  Oh I forgot to mention that there are these little monster that I guess live in the big monster or ride the big monster, again you have no explantaion about this.  So the one girl gets bit by one of this monster and she pretty much explodes later on.  But still after seeing that he still has to go and save his booty call.  Let me say the ending is the most dumbest I have ever seen.  It ends with them in under a bridge in centrel part and saying that they love each other and a bomb hits close by and the bridge collapses on top of them, THE END.  You have no idea what happens to the monster, it just ends like that.  Please don't waste you 1hr 15 min on the film, it is so DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1212278400,5,2039,4.01985111662531

To sum this up, there is no ultimate showdown, which means like the energizer bunny, it goes on leaving you with questions that are yet to be answered.

1586953,3,B00005JPXY,"In January of 2008, audiences were filled with anticipation about a newly released film that most knew essentially nothing about, other than the fact that something or someone is rampaging across New York City in the new thriller from producer J.J. Abrams (""Mission: Impossible 3"") called ""Cloverfield"". The high expectations surrounding this unknown film had been fed for quite some time via successful internet marketing campaigns that teased audiences about what may be coming soon to a theater near them. The film's release didn't disappoint, as soon-to-be fans arrived in droves to see what this mystery film was all about, delivering the 2008 box office year an incredible kick-start. Upon release of the film, word quickly spread that who or what was terrorizing New York was actually a gigantic monster and this film was being heralded as one of the most unique monster movies ever made. Now, ""Cloverfield"" has finally arrived on DVD and Blu-Ray, and after viewing the film, I find myself with a decidedly mixed feeling towards it.

""Cloverfield"" focuses on a group of friends gathered together to say good-bye to one of their own as he prepares to leave for Japan to take on a new executive position at a successful company. However, their celebration is cut drastically short as explosions rock the city. Filled with fear, and an undeniable curiosity regarding what could have caused the explosions the friends head outside to see what they can discover. Unfortunately for them, and most New Yorkers, what they find is nothing short of the seemingly impossible, as a giant monster, as tall as the tallest skyscrapers, is rampaging through the city destroying everything in sight. Now, these friends are on the run for their lives as they try to find any place that is safe from the creature's wrath, all the while trying to find answers as to what the monster is and where it came from; however, no one, not even the military that is desperately trying to stop it, seems to have any clue whatsoever.

Director Matt Reeves (TV's ""Lost"") chose a rather unique approach to ratcheting up the suspense-filled story of ""Cloverfield"" by opting for a significantly limited field of vision via the handheld camera that is used as the only visual source for the entire movie. The last time, that I can recall, this technique was done successfully was with the 1999 surprise horror hit, ""The Blair Witch Project"", so it was surprising to me that Reeves would opt for this same approach of using only one camera to tell the entire story. Many directors have chosen the handheld camera as their camera of choice, although usually utilizing more than one camera; a recent example would be director Paul Greengrass' chilling portrayal of the sad events of September 11th in the film ""United 93"". Whatever the reasons, the decision worked; even giving a person the feeling of being right there with the characters in certain scenes. In the end, audiences simply couldn't get enough of this movie, although the free-moving camera caused some audience members moments of discomfort due to motion-sickness, but even those instances would prove inconsequential in this film's massive success at the box office.

The story for ""Cloverfield"" was written by Drew Goddard, another of J.J. Abrams' crew on the hit TV show ""Lost"", apparently Abrams wanted to keep things in house for this movie, a decision that may have helped keep the details of the film surprisingly quiet all the way up to the film's release to theaters. Goddard crafted a very suspenseful monster movie that managed to work even without showing the monster in full view until the film's closing moments. By relying on the reactions of his characters, and the devastation being done to the surrounding environments, Drew Goddard along with his director's choice for only using one camera managed to keep tensions high and interest piqued from start to finish throughout the incredibly fast-moving, but disappointingly short running time. This is where part of my mixed feelings towards this movie stems from, an average running time for a movie is in the range of 90 minutes to two hours; however, ""Cloverfield"" clocks in at 1 hour and 13 minutes of actual screen time devoted to story (which I felt ripped off by), with an additional 11 minutes of credits (no joke) that scrawl painfully slow across the screen to bring the overall run time to 1 hour 24 minutes, although considering that to be the official run time seems like cheating to me. Not to mention the abrupt ending to the film left me feeling like the movie was incomplete, which was of course a calculated move on the filmmaker's part to attempt to guarantee a sequel would be necessary to this movie, even though the box office receipts turned out to be high enough that a sequel became a no-brainer early on.

Each member of the primary cast of ""Cloverfield"" now has the good fortune of having such a massive blockbuster on their rsum as their first official work in movies. Not bad for a bunch of newcomers, and for the most part each member deserves any good fortune that comes their way from this film, because most of them were surprisingly very good actors for not having much, if any, prior experience in film acting. The only truly disappointing member of the cast was the friend serving as the cameraman, and this was mostly because he was just so annoying with almost every line of dialogue he had throughout the movie, and sadly he was speaking in almost every scene because he was the character holding the camera for the duration. If the cameraman hadn't been such an annoying character, making surprisingly ridiculous comments that never helped matters in the desperate situation these friends have found themselves in, perhaps I would have enjoyed ""Cloverfield"" more definitively, instead of being so mixed on my thoughts of it.

""Cloverfield"" is undoubtedly an entertaining monster film, and I would have to agree with the sentiment that it is possibly one of the best ever made; however, an extremely short running time along with too abrupt an ending, and an annoying cameraman/supporting character leaves me feeling somewhat cheated and unsatisfied by the experience.

""Cloverfield"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1212192000,2,6263,4.948669201520913
1586954,3,B00005JPXY,"After reading various reports of people leaving the cinema halfway through film due to nausea caused by the camcorder effect of the filming I pre-ordered this with some reluctance. However, I found it better than expected. Don`t get me wrong, it is very annoying to have the picture `thrown around 24/7 but after a while I didn`t notice it quite so much. It would have been so much better to have had `normal` footage but that would have taken away the idea of `caught on camera`.
The beginning where the characters are introduced is quite drawn out and I didn`t really care what happened to any of them as they were all annoying but once the film got started I quite enjoyed it. I found myself dying to see the `monster` up close and it didn`t really disappoint. Especially when near the end the one fellow looks around to see it looming over him after you thought it was dead.  I would have liked to see more made of landmarks being destroyed to get a better feeling of the carnage going on around the characters and their world crumpling around them.

This film was meant to be shaky. You think you can run down a street and hold a camera straight??? If so, you're an idiot. I saw this on opening day and I'll never forget how much tension was going through me. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

The story is: A group of people are throwing a goodbye party for their friend going away to Japan. On the night of the party, a monster attacks and terrorizes the city, and 5 people must fight to stay alive. The movie was taken from the point of Hud and the video camera, and this film is done in the very interesting style of filming an account of the attack.

This movie was amazing. Fantastic acting, straight and to-the-point action, wastes no time on character development, and has one of the most chilling apocalyptic endings since The Birds. The ending is rather left open, and that's a good thing, because I'd rather that type of ending than an ending where the monster dies and people celebrate like nothing ever happened.

Another thing I like was how there were NO cliches- there is no scene where the scientist steps into the frame and delivers a boring, 5 minute Shakespearian monologue about the origin of the Monster. You don't know where the monster came from... and that's a good thing.

So overall, in the time of cliche'd and stupid movies like Sex And The City, Shutter, Meet The Spartans, and 27 Dresses, we get a very tight and fast paced film that is very No-BS, has your heart racing, your adrenaline pumping, and your blood rushing. Overall, a very profound movie. And please kick yourself in the nuts if you didn't see this in the theater. I saw it in the theater on opening day and loved it. I own it on DVD. That very day I saw it, I was on the edge of my seat and felt like I was on a nonstop rollercoaster.",1212019200,7,2005,4.336
1587019,3,B00005JPXY,"Well I will start off that the movie is fairly decent story wise but really dissappointed me with the hand held camera perspective.  I know blair witch was an initial success due to some really smart marketing (which by the way seemed to be the exact strategy they used for cloverfield) but seriously the movie sucked the showing I went to everyone demanded their money back and they couldn't give away the DVD's where I was at overseas.  While I know I am not reviewing that regurgitated bile of a movie the escence of cloverfield just reeks of blairwitch to me.  From marketing to filming to not leaving any type of explanation to anything even the fate of the characters mirror the witch (possible blessing in disguise??? I mean if there is a sequel it would be pretty difficult to cast them again).  Rent this one, that is unless you liked godzilla (the one with matthew brodderick or however you spell his name) truth be told I actually prefer godzilla over this heap of monster poo.

On a side note, noting that J.J. Abrams is also directing the latest installment in Star Trek franchise I know a number of trekkies that if gives us a movie from spock's perspective via ""handy-cam"" or what the heck ever they will use in the future to give it that blair witch witch feel... I am fairly confident that they will without hesitation ""blair witch"" him.

The fact that there aren't any really famous actors in it definitely works in the movies' favour cos it seems much more believable.

Aside from this, the panic and mystery surrounding the monster was still done very well. I felt the reactions of the actors to what was going on was  as natural as such a fictitious story could get. That is, if there were actually such a monster plaguing the streets of Manhattan, I believe people would react similarly to the way they did in the film. The monster itself was awesome.

Cloverfield is an excellent American monster movie. A good 21st century update to the 1950's genre of Japanese monster movies.  Character development is well done.. and is no easy feat in a movie which is shot like this one.  The film is presented as a few hours of amateur video tape that was found by the government after a disaster in NYC. To the filmmakers credit, they stick completely this format, never breaking from it once, enhancing the first person experience for all of us. The monster itself is not of the traditional sort, and gives your imagination plenty to wonder about.

I thought this movie was different and made me really think what if? It kept me entertained throughout and the characters were pretty good, but the whole Rob-Beth thing could have been left out.",1211760000,7,651,4.336065573770492
1587111,4,B00005JPXY,"CLOVERFIELD is one of those movies you think could become a cult smash or a video store reliable; it is not one of those that will quietly fade away.
You probably know the conceit of the movie-- a ""goodbye reel"" shot for a farewell party becomes a documentary on New York suffering a genuine Godzilla event. It keeps everything grounded and ground-level, in the very best sense, as the small (and dwindling) group of characters struggle not to beat the monster but simply to survive.
On the big screen, the action is vertiginous (my friend had to leave after about 20 minutes, because the videocam shooting technique was making her queasy). This is less pronounced on the video, though, which is a good thing.
There are lots of surprises and shocks, but keep your eye out for two small bits in particular-- the shot at Coney Island at the very end, and a vocal bit after the credits stop rolling.
CLOVERFIELD is likely to spawn a number of lesser imitations but this one is a keeper.",1211760000,5,983,4.590909090909091
1587112,1,B00005JPXY,"This movie was so bad that's it's hard to find much to say about it, other than that it's worse than Blair Witch. It may be artsy in some peoples' minds to film movies of people filming movies with a camcorder, but that was already badly done in Blair Witch, and it's even more badly done in this one (believe it).

The acting was less than awful, but the plot and storyline were boring and unbelievable even within the genre. The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Why in a country the size of the US, do monsters always attack NY? Why do they never attack places like Idaho? Hasn't the filmmaking industry put NY through enough? Why doesn't the guy doing the filming put down the camera and help his friends? Why doesn't the battery in the camera die? What brand of camera is this? I need one of them. Why do bridges never get destroyed by monsters when no one is on them? Why do historic monuments always get destroyed? Do aliens and monsters really prefer those over all the rundown buildings, even in NY?

The Blair Witch Project at least had an interesting plot even if the movie itself was bad. There is nothing redeeming in Cloverfield. It's one of those movies that don't just leave you wondering if you can get your money back, but instead wondering if you can receive punitive damages for the nausea and the time you wasted watching it.

According to Amazon, people who bought this movie also bought The Mist. If you like to be scared, get that one instead. It was brilliant, horrifying, and very disturbing.",1211673600,7,1528,4.509025270758123

All CLOVERFIELD does is take the ""found"" amateur video to a high tech level, with some impressive visual results, but not enough investment on the viewers behalf. Whereas one could almost believe the mythology of BLAIR WITCH as something that might have really happened, we all know the major event that is depicted in CLOVERFIELD never happened and it was only a movie.  So, why not make it a movie. The shaky hand-held camera is highly distracting for the most part (do not see this movie in a theater if you are susceptible to motion sickness!) and does not allow for the full enjoyment of the special effects. In one of the special features on the disc, one of the film-makers notes the enduring status of the Godzilla monster in Japan and suggests that Americans need their own monster hero.  I submit that Clover is not it based on this movie.  Unlike Godzilla of the Japanese films, the character and origins of Clover is not established enough to make it notable. Perhaps this can be done in another Clover movie, or better yet a remake of this one without the visually annoying hand-held cameras.  By the way, speaking of the special features, the documentaries are fairly interesting so don't forget to watch them if you watch the movie-- they will add to your appreciation of what the film-makers did do with CLOVERFIELD.",1211673600,2,1442,4.7063492063492065

Idiotic. And what was with the sappy ""I love you! I love you too!!"" ending? All monster movies require the willful suspension of disbelief, but this dreck requires that you go waaaay beyond that in order to enjoy it. It also requires that, given all that they are going through, they still have the presence of mind to make sure to record the entire event. The only redeeming quality was that I got to look at the yummy Jessica Lucas for an hour or so.

But ""Cloverfield"" is not perfect; for one the monster is a little video game boss like (but done extremely well) and why oh why is HUD filming his POV of a life or death disaster? He must be a moron! (actually the script doesn't make him smart in the least, so the makers tried to say ""Hey he never dropped the cam to run for his life cuz he really is a moron!"") Well SORRY even a moron would drop the camera to run for his life! So there is a problem there. The makers should have devised a helmet cam device that is somehow written into the plot, but even that sounds gimmicky.

Also, maybe it's technically possible to run a cam's battery for the length of this movie, but this cam ain't filming a T-ball game. It gets dropped numerous times, never appears to even run low on battery life AND the tape itself (or hard drive) survives (spoiler alert ) a nuclear bomb? Amazing! What brand of camera is that? Cuz I want one!

But the plot-dilemma's of the cam doesn't ruin the spirit of fun and horror this movie provides. I would like a little more humor and a tad better acting. But this is fun, different and most important .. entertaining!!",1211414400,4,1284,4.236734693877551
1587171,3,B00005JPXY,"What is this movie about?  Blair Witch Project style filming of a gigantic monster that wrecks havoc on New York City (Godzilla strikes NYC).  Cloverfield is the government name for the incident.  The camcorder is found at some later point and it shows the disaster from the viewpoint of a few ""regular"" people who try to escape and then through various reasons wind up close to the monster.  Somehow these regular people don't put down the camera even under the craziest of circumstances.

There was a lot of marketing about this movie and this got me very interested in the film and it reminds me of a set of books I read long ago from Gregory Benford that started with ""The Ocean of Night"" and then progressed on to ""Across the Sea of Suns."" In them there is talk of animal monsters that are flung to earth by some super advanced aliens to keep humanity down.  All through the viral marketing for this movie, I kept thinking that this was an ""adaptation"" or recasting of Benford's fantastic book series -- who knows though, maybe its just a recasting of Godzilla.

Regarding the movie:

What I loved:
a) The concept -- there is just so much that goes untold that just makes us wonder what this thing is, where it came from, the parasites or baby creatures.  Is this an invasion from space?  Are the creatures sent by some super advanced race to attack us (ala Benford's Across the Sea of Suns)? Is it the product of pollution? evolution? engineering by humans (oh dear god, no not another movie of pollution gives breed to monster)?  Please let it be Benford's vision.

b) The fact that they left enough open for us to speculate

c) The fact that there is so much left to make a sequel about

d) The acting came across as real

What I hated:

a) Jerky filming - this is ala blair witch but gosh everything is jerky the entire movie.  Starts off slow and then jerky jerky jerky jerky -- gosh.

b) The sometimes silly things that were done by characters....like going towards a gigantic monster that is wrecking havoc in NYC (I'd be running away - always away)

b) So little is told, that this movie lives in my imagination more than in the film

c) if they make a sequel and they tell us more, they're going to displease some of us when the monster turns out to be some creation of a polluted world or something that gets awakened when the polar ice caps melt -- etc.

Overall:

a) if you love sci fi - watch this, you'll like

b) if you're a regular person - stay away, you'll hate

c) if you like monster flicks - watch, you'll like

d) if you hate jerky reality filming - stay away, you'll hate

Overall, to me this was just a giant advertisement for a 300millon dollar summer blockbuster sequel if they do it right (but please no more shaky single camera filming) -- give me a story, and infocus special effects --- give me Benford's world! JJ Abrams has the talent, corporate backing, and Benford has the storyline.",1211328000,2,2922,4.435272045028142
1587172,1,B00005JPXY,"If you value your lunch (or dinner) don't watch this movie.  The whole thing is filmed in what I call the ""shakey cam"" style and if your prone to motion sickness you WILL be sick before the movie ends.

Some of the reviews on here say good things about the acting, but I don't see how you can tell if the acting was good.  The shakey cam was so bad that I spent more than half the moving looking away from the screen.  From what I could here the dialogue was mostly ""lets get out of here"", ""Dude where are you going"", and ""Aaaaaa oh god oh god"".

I thought the big monster was goofy looking, and the small ones were rip offs of the bugs from Starship Troopers (another horrible movie).

I wish I could give this movie negative stars.",1211328000,5,733,4.163120567375887
1587173,3,B00005JPXY,"The most impressive component of this movie was the marketing and hype machine that labored day and night, whipping the Internet up into a frenzy many, many months before this film was ever released.  (Why is there no featurette about that on the DVD?  I think that would have been a pretty interesting peek behind the curtain.)

The film itself, while occasionally clever, often lapses into long stretches of irritating and repetetive shouting and poor acting.  (Not unlike it's predecessor, The Blair Witch Project.)  I wasn't much bothered by the much-maligned ""shaky-cam"" cinematography, though.  It thought it was handled well here and brought a visceral excitement and energy to the whole thing.  (But if you're prone to any kind of motion sickness, you should probably avoid this one.)

It's the lack of a quality script that's the movie's biggest fundamental problem.  In order for a ""characters in peril"" movie to work, we have to actually care about the characters.  Which means, they need to be developed and fleshed out into sympathetic and relatable human beings.  That never happens here.  These shallow characters never really deepen.  They start out as petulant, whiny and grating ... and they end up exactly the same way ... only louder and more frantic.  (I suppose it's appropriate that we meet them all at a party in the opening sequence since the small-talk introductions are about as much character work as we get.)  But the problem is, if the audience has a hard time caring about them ... well ... then they're just not gonna care whether those characters live or die.

And if we don't care if they live or die, then we also won't care if they're in any danger.  Which undercuts any potential suspense.

As a result, the movie is reduced to a series of ""BOO!"" type scares that wear off shortly after the surprise.  (I enjoyed those moments very much - they're well executed - but I was also amused at how often a 20-story monster was able to sneak up on our heroes!)

On balance, I didn't mind this movie.  There's a nifty creature design and I thought the ""shaky-cam"" aesthetic worked well for the movie.  But with a better script and more appealing actors, this could have been a much more satisfying, thrilling and frightening movie experience.",1211241600,,2271,4.813953488372093

1587287,5,B00005JPXY,"I think Cloverfield was one of the scariest ""monster"" movies I have ever seen. It was also thoroughly entertaining, as well as, disturbing. Filming the entire movie from a hand-held point of view was nothing short of genious. The effect: it makes you feel as if you're there, part of the action, and not just an innocent spectator. But, there are other reasons why this movie is frightening: 1. there are no big-time actors that play the macho hero who saves the day, so you can't assume or expect that this is going to end well; 2. The new, basically unknown actors are more like everyday people you can closely identify with; 3. Like the actors, you have absolutely no idea what is happening or why this is happening. 4. There are no breaks from the intensity of the action, like changing camera angles or scenes.  You are here, you don't know what is happening, people are dying all around you, there is mass confusion, there are no other points of view, say from the safety of the President's Oval office, or some high ranking general's bunker. In other words, you are given one, and only one, perspective. Unlike most other movies, which switch scenes to put you ""in the know"", Cloverfield gives no answers.
The special effects and sound effects are outstanding, and there is one particular scene that is just too intense to explain. Suffice it to say that when the military suddenly shows up blasting away at the thing, all hell breaks loose, and like the actors, all you'd want to do is duck & cover.  Leave your pre-conceived ideas at the door, shut off the lights and crank up the volume.  Enjoy !!",1211155200,8,1607,4.592334494773519
1587288,1,B00005JPXY,"This was absolutely dreadful. It was totally unrealistic and stupid. I had no idea as to what was going on, first it was this weird party for the entire first quarter of the movie where people where gossiping about the person the party was for. Then an oil tanker explodes and everyone's screaming. Then out of no where this giant bug thing appears (it's really weird) and starts killing people. Then one of the characters wants to go after his friend where the bug is. So they all go after it. Then some mini versions of the bug (WTF? Where did these come from) attack them and injures some bitchy person that the person in charge of the camera is hitting on. Later she has to be killed because she was bitten and there's no explanation. So they come to this destroyed building and someone says that the friend is on the 39th floor. So they then go up to the 57th floor of another building and have to walk across some poles to another part of the building. They then find the person who may or may no be injured. First she was dead, then she was hurt, then they got something out of her, then she couldn't walk, and then she could run all of a sudden. What the hell? So then they get out of the building and find the helicopter before the town gets blown up (Yes, they were going to blow up Manhattan). They find the helicopter (Which just happens to be a block away) and get in. Then they see the bug thing die and then all of a sudden it's alive again. Then they crash for no apparent reason. They all survive the several hundred foot drop without the gas tank exploding, or hitting a building, or any of the many deadly things that would have happened. They just happen to land in central park. Then the bug thing picks up the guy with the camera, kills him, and puts him down (The camera survives again). Then the remaining two people go under a bridge and sum up the story by saying ""I love you"" to each other as the bridge collapses on them. The camera survives several tons of rock and is later found by people. (Wait, didn't they blow Manhattan up? Oops, I guess not.)
Other bad things: It went from the middle of the night to morning in one hour. It was REALLY short, barely over an hour. It made no sense. You couldn't see anything with the camera and by the end of the movie I was about to throw up from the motion.

1587290,5,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is not only much better than I was expecting, it is, in fact, an extremely clever, well-executed, and scary movie. Kudos to the team that produced this film, as it could have gone wrong in so many ways.

Without providing spoilers, I will describe the premise of ""Cloverfield"" as follows: what if a monster movie were real? Now, that may seem like a trivial premise, because any work of fiction attempts to create a sense of reality. But think about it: there are fictional movies about ""real stuff"" (i.e. Howard's End, The Right Stuff, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.) and there are fictional movies about ""not-real stuff"" (i.e. Godzilla, Star Wars, Fahrenheit 911, etc.) Well, what if there were a monster in a ""real stuff"" movie? The effect would be, and is, quite unsettling, and this is what ""Cloverfield"" attempts, through the device of an unedited home movie that presents, in large part, the mundane material of which most such movies are made.

For this reason, ""Cloverfield"" reminds me a bit of Shyamalan's ""Signs"", which I felt attempted to do the very same thing (and which was also very effective). It also reminded me of Stephen King's ""The Mist"" (the novella, not the movies) mostly due to the nightmarish collision of unreality and reality that both share.

One thing that impressed me is that the device used in the film could have easily become contrived or gimmicky if not handled with extreme finesse; everything was spot on. I found myself grinning as the film really got going, enjoying what the filmmakers were doing. The grinning soon went away, as the movie is actually pretty scary.

""Cloverfield"" leaves you wanting more, and with many questions unanswered. (Although, as with other J.J. Abrams works, some answers are there if you look closely enough...) If you love scary movies, and are not a TOTAL BABY about shaky, hand-held camera footage, you will love ""Cloverfield!""",1211155200,12,1911,4.925465838509317

It is definitely not cute to watch all these hideously boring twenty-somethings gossip about each other and play the ""who's sleeping with whom"" game and act as if it's the most profound thing anyone could imagine.
The party which opens the movie is a total bore and so are ALL the characters, most notably the dullard who plays Hud the accidental videographer who records the whole stinking movie on a handicam, very jerkily and with his snide comments and ridiculous rantings heard endlessly on voiceover.
It was a somewhat clever idea to put unknowns into the heart of the action without any explanation about this dinosaur-like monster who is invading Manhattan, but it doesn't add up to a sense of terror or show any uplifting aspects of any of the characters.
The one attempt at selflessness is instead foolishness and completely unbelievable. Rob gets a cell phone message from the girlfriend he's abandoned and who showed up at his party with an alternate date to spite him. Rob then defies all logic and heads back toward where Beth is apparently dying, just to prove he is, after all, a good guy who doesn't desert his ex-lovers.
It's just so much hogwash that viewers need a dose of mouthwash afterwards just to keep the bile from spilling over.
This movie shoud get NO stars, but there is some risk involved in making this kind of asinine nonsense and some of the special effects were reasonably good, but if you're looking for an ""arty"" or ""thinking person's"" horror or sci-fi, you'd be better off taking a nap and waiting for a daydream and avoiding this nightmare of a production.",1211155200,3,1729,4.74750830564784

1587355,5,B00005JPXY,"[ No spoilers, though if you've read many of the other reviews that's probably a lost cause for you anyway. ]

I'll keep this short and to the point: Cloverfield is an almost-entirely successful film in that it achieves exactly what it sets out to achieve, in spades.  All too frequently with movies of this genre you reach the end feeling bored, disappointed, and even cheated, but Cloverfield went beyond my highest expectations.  I'd recommend it without hesitation to anyone who's a fan of movies like this.

Two points about the negative reviews, which frankly astonished me when I first saw them, given how good the movie was.  First, it's true that it's filmed through a handheld video camera and is very shaky, but I got used to that quickly and practically forgot about it as the story hit its stride.  Second, I came to the film knowing absolutely nothing about it except that it might be vaguely X-Files'esque, and I think that made a tremendous difference.  If you know what it's about you may have certain expectations about how it *should* unfold, based on other similarly-themed films you've seen; since I had no idea at all and no preconceptions, I was able to just experience it on its own terms.  Reading through some of the negative reviews, it seems clear that that was often the problem.

In any case, don't listen to the naysayers; watch it and decide for yourself.",1211068800,6,1387,4.721991701244813
1587356,3,B00005JPXY,"Sorry, but the last time I watched something like this I walked away with a headache from all the ""amateur"" camera work and uneven dialog...and I'm being polite. As a college film project; an experiment, if you will, this would receive a passing grade. But to spend an absolute fortune on special effects and then waste it on deliberately bad cinematography, kind of made me sick. The forced dialog also felt about as realistic as the unlikely visit of the pissed-off space monster and its legion of nasty progeny. Nonetheless, I gave this film 3 stars because I actually liked some of the special effects work; the sound, the lighting, the creatures. They were quite good, actually, and particularly from a helicopter above Manhattan where the frat boys and their girlfriends watched the thing rip apart buildings. And speaking of the cast, the fact that they survived longer than any humans in any zombie movie I've ever seen had me rooting for the creatures. Endless creature attacks, helicopter crashes, bridge collapses, you name it. They just kept going and going and going...Anyway, by the end of the movie, I wanted to kill that idiot with the handicam. I prayed for just 5 minutes of smooth footage, but nooooooooo. And then it was over and I thought to myself what an idiot I was for spending a bunch of money on the DVD rather than downloading it for 4 bucks. Whatever, if you liked Blair Witch, you'll probably like this as well. At least you get a pretty cool creature with some attractive, and rather acrobatic, children.",1211068800,2,1535,4.774436090225564

The vid cam (that was one excellent camera, and I want that battery!) film style added greatly to the suspense, and the acting was right on, realistic.  A solid movie with a somewhat predictable, but yet touching ending.  (Speilberg should take lessons from this film-making of scifi).",1211068800,5,401,5.045454545454546

I'm sure that most people simply dislike this movie because of the camera shakiness and, well, I agree... it really gets you and can make you feel dizzy at times but I think it adds to the movie, to the plot and to the whole experience.

Now, if you have never seen it you probably know by now that is about a monster -- that is unfortunate; Amazon should control comments that contain spoilers because a huge part of being able to enjoy the movie is to know absolutely nothing about it. Next, make sure you have a nice TV and a VERY good sound system; that will definitely help you enjoy the movie. Remember, the idea is to watch a movie the way the director intended it to be watched and Cloverfield really demands some powerful sub-woofer ;)

This movie will capture you and will take you into a journey right next to the main characters. The ""apparent"" single shot effect throughout the whole movie is amazing, the special effects are the best I've ever seen (watch the DVD behind the scenes to understand my statement and you will find that most of what you saw wasn't real) and the acting is not bad at all.

Give it a shot because, under the right conditions, this is probably one of the top 20 movies ever made. (Let the flaming begin).",1211068800,3,1318,4.371428571428571

I watched the extras and all I learned is that the monster is a baby, which you don't get from the movie. You don't know what it is, where it came from, why it is here or why the movie is called Cloverfield when it takes place in NY. There were too many unanswered questions. Also, really who would hold on to a stupid camera that long and go back for it when it is dropped. Movie is pathetic, stupid and boring, also has a stupid ending.

There were a couple of times I actually thought that if Hud would quit shaking the camera so much, this might not be a bad movie. The special effects are great, and the acting is not too bad, but I wanted some CLOSURE and gave a low rating because I did not get it. Someone please tell me...

What finally happened to the monster?

Where did the monster come from...space???

What happens to the ""bite victims""??

Aside from these main questions I also wondered...

Why are those girls continuing to run in high heels?

How did the Army get to Manhatten so fast, were they pulled from Iraq???

1587405,5,B00005JPXY,"After reading some of the griefer reviews which indicate people have a big problem with the hand-held camera work, I realized people must have somehow missed the huge marketing and significant coverage Cloverfield received. If it isn't apparent, this is a mega-monster film from the perspective of regular folks with a video camera. That's part of what makes the movie work because giant monsters tearing up Tokyo and New York have been appearing as  special effects extravaganzas for almost a century.

The other part which makes this film work is the mystery surrounding events taking place that, to the studio and creative teams credit, happen in the film, in an online game, and through easter eggs hidden in the DVD. Instead of just spending two hours as a couch potato, there is an opportunity to watch the movie and then get caught up in all the unresolved issues that will make for a great sequel but also provide a significant amount of fun along the way.

Key points:
+ Special effects and compositing don't steal the show, seamlessly integrating well done CGI makes the creatures part of the movie instead of the movie itself.
+ Ground-up perspective gives a claustrophobic sense to Manhattan, leaving viewers trapped in a grid while the monster smashes through whatever is in the way.
+ The monster comes across as a bear cub discovering a bee hive, almost innocent, which is a difficult task considering how little screen time it is given.
+ Every character, whether they are on screen most of the film or just running by, appear equally helpless and in character with the exception of Hud and Rob.

- The two main characters, Hud and Rob are flawed due to the plot requiring they both focus outside the situation (Rob on finding a girl, Hud on filming).
- The protagonist of the film, the monster, took a backseat to the lead characters saccharine sweet quest to save someone.
- It's clear that the studio need for a teen-viewable rating significantly impacted the writing and direction of the film.",1210982400,3,2013,4.809248554913295

Can you imagine if ""War of The Worlds"" was made in this meduim?

1587410,3,B00005JPXY,"I'm not a big fan of giant monster movies, though I don't hate them either.  I watched this mostly because I like J.J. Abrams, the producer.  The first twenty minutes or so are pretty boring, and I wanted to turn the movie off.  The cameraman, Hud, panning the audience during the party, created some moments of queasiness, but overall wasn't that bad - especially compared with later camera effects.  I found Hud to be really annoying and insensitive, and I found myself hoping he would die so I wouldn't have to listen to him anymore.

Other than the constant camera jerking, supposedly made to look like a hand-held video camera in a real-life situation (good job by the creators in making it real), I only found minor flaws, or things I didn't like for some reason.  Spoilers, so don't read if you want to be 100% surprised.

One, the head of the Statue of Liberty seems much too small when it comes flying down the street.  And all the people taking pictures of it?  I think I'd be running away from it.

Rob's need to run right past the monster (who is everywhere they turn) into the city to find his best friend, Beth, was believable on one level -he loves her, after all.  But, I think there comes a point when most people would cut their losses and run away.  Of course, if Rob did this, there wouldn't be a movie.

Beth's ability to run while seriously injured (down 57 flights of stairs, no less) amused me.  I felt she should have been carried or dragged more than she was.

Why is it that in every monster movie, the entire city has to cross a major bridge?  Don't they know the bridge will collapse for some reason?  I wanted to smack them all.  I realize they're on an island, but dang - this is very sterotypical.

One thing my husband pointed out that I was thinking also... Rob's phone call to his mother didn't seem emotional enough, but then he immediately broke down and became more emotional than Lilly.  It was weird that she was remaining more calm while he was not.  Given the relationship in question, I can see why he was so upset, but something about the emotions didn't seem real.

Oh, and how the heck do they NOT see the monster (which I really liked the look of, by the way - I expected Godzilla and was surprised to see something new and creative) in broad daylight until it was standing right over Hud?  Several moments like this, even in the dark made me realize this was definitely a movie, not very realistic.  I think I would have seen that thing miles away, even in the dark, and not been surprised to find it so close to me.

All in all, I liked this.  I will probably never watch it again, though, because the camera angle really got to me.  My husband didn't have a problem with it - it really is subjective.  I recommend this movie to people who like suspense and haven't eaten recently or don't become easily nauseated.",1210896000,,2863,4.4019047619047615

At first I was like no way, please don't tell me this is a Blare Witch Rip (film documented from person holding the camera and leaves the viewer believing the film will get better throughout, but does not). Well at least it was in color.
Negatives:
1) Hudd the individual shooting the film was an annoying character
2)You don't get to know the characters in the film long enough to really care about them
3) Film was shot in  first person and it made me feel that if I had friends that were gifted in special effects it wouldn't take much to make this film(subjective opinion)
4)No real ending, and because the viewer did not get to know the characters the irony doesn't mean very much
5)Overall a fake out viewer waits for the film to get better and there are a few fake outs but it does not. It leaves the viewer disappointed until the credits roll
Positives:
1)The chaos is realistic
2)The irony of how the film was shot over a previous tape
3)The idea onwhich the film was based has potential. If remade with a real ending, better writing, and some serious editing it could actually be decent.

1587529,5,B00005JPXY,"First, I don't understand the barage of bad reviews because of the home video-like filming of the movie.  This was one of the most publicized aspects of this film!  This is not Godzilla or Alien vs. Predator or King Kong.  The movie was made to capture the plight of a group of people as they try to escape the wrath of a huge monster destrying Manhattan.

That being said, this movie was better than I expected.  And that's saying something, because I was amped to see this since the preview in front of Transformers.

I loved the home movie quality that started with a going away party for Rob.  A party that had the normal scenes of a guy (Hud) shyly chasing after a hot girl (Marlena) and the tension between a guy and a girl that are obviously in love but won't talk to each other (Rob and Beth).  Just as the Rob-Beth issue starts getting old, all hell breaks loose.  From that point on the film is incredibly intense.

Glimpses of the monster are seen right away as it dismantles the city.  We get a few closer looks of the creature as our heroes rush through the city.  And I have to say, this monster is awesome.  Nothing like Godzilla, King Kong, or anything ever seen destroying a city.  I recommend watching the extras afterwards to hear the writer, director, and FX folks talking about it.

Without going into plot, I will say that I loved the story-line.  Uncomplicated and straitfoward.  Clover (as the monster is referred to by the director) is on the loose and wreaking havoc.  Will our band of party goers make it out of the city?  Will the creature be defeated?  What the heck is the creature?  It doesn't matter.  This is one of the most original horror/thriller flicks in a long time.  Intense, scary, funny, gory, and intense (did I say that already).

I haven't bought the video yet, but I saw it once in theatres and now have it on Netflix - and I've been watching it about every two days for the past two weeks.  (Actually this last couple times it's been good background noise...)  But I rated the film five stars because it is everything you get for the idea Abrams wanted to put on the screen.

The first thing I want to review, however - more address - is the complaint of the shaky camera.  You've got a handheld camera being held by an amateur.  OF COURSE things are going to be shaky.  People who have complained about this I feel two things for.  One: get over it.  It's supposed to be that way, it's supposed to be gritty and real and even annoying, just like a basic home movie would be.  Two: if it DOES cause you to be sick, I'm sorry.  Perhaps you weren't warned about it when you walked into the theatre.  But that's the fault of the theatre, not the fault of the movie.  So stop blaming the director and the camera operator for it.

I thought the camera work was quite well.  You could even tell the differences based on who was holding the camera.  Rob had a fairly steady hand during the flashback scenes, (though it was shaky near the end - but he WAS being BOMBED), Hud's camerawork improved throughout the film. Jason had a shaky hand, period, because he was trying to learn how to work the thing.  For the complaints about how shaky things were - he was walking, running, ducking, and of course there was this huge MONSTER walking around whose footsteps likely caused at least some minute shaking.  We're supposed to see the film through the camera lens, not Hud's eyes, (an argumentative point given how often he zoomed into Marlena during Lily's testimonial).

The camera should not be blamed for 'making this film bad'.

I was mildly annoyed at the usage of 'monster movie moments'.  Of course, it IS a monster movie, so it is going to follow some of the same tracks.  I do wish the annoying little buggers hadn't shown up when they did though.  The moment the night vision was on, they were visible.  It would have been a little scarier if they had shown up sometime AFTER the vision was on so the audience was over their initial ""He's going to turn it on and the monsters will be there"", and was just beginning to relax.  Then all of a sudden SURPRISE!

What I am most worried about is that they are planning a sequel (or prequel, not sure which).  This movie caught audience attention from its first trailer running, (which I believe was in front of Transformers?), and sheer curiosity factor made for a huge opening night.  (I say brilliant marketing).  But half of the world seemed to like it and half hated it.  A sequel will diminish the power of the film.",1210550400,6,2755,4.41948310139165
1587531,4,B00005JPXY,"I saw Cloverfield twice the first weekend it came out, I thought it was a really good story.  I still don't understand where the monster came from, was it a U.S.Government fabrication that got loose? Where did it come from?

For me, this was a love story.

There are elements of Sci Fi (the monster) and Action (everyone running around screaming and trying not to get eaten and just survive it all), but these elements had to be included to attract those of us interested in Sci Fi and Action.

The love or romance part has to do with the two people involved. They both fight at his going away party, and it's their tape of that one special day together that gets taped over while making this ""movie"".  Thats why you see bits and pieces of their special day at Coney Island every so often. It has to do with him being stripped to the core of his being after losing his brother and observing the chaos around him, and deciding that his love for her is real and he's not going let her go or lose her, especially after her phone call telling him she's in trouble.

The remainder of the cast chose to follow him around in his quest to find her and save her. They all had a good opportunity to leave the city. And I found him to be noble in choosing to go after her.

The Monster - I liked the monster, too bad the writers didn't bother to provide any back story, origin, explanation, etc..

The Characters - A bunch of stupid, self-absorbed yuppies do not make very sympathetic central characters for a film. The main character is the worst of all; only someone named ""Hud"" would be stupid enough to go along with a guy trying to find his ex-girlfriend in the middle of a giant monster attack. I was waiting for him to say ""I'll get my best friends to safety, but I will go back later for my ex-girlfriend, after I stop by the local hardware store and grab a few shotguns, some flashlights, some walkie talkies if anyone is coming with me, hardhats, maybe some climbing gear.."", but that never happened.

The Scene in the Subway Tunnel - Try fighting a large animal with razor sharp claws and teeth, in the dark, with your bare hands. You will lose.

The Military - Wow. Did they even talk to ANYONE in the armed services before writing this screenplay. I was waiting for the AC-130H Spectre to show up (105mm Cannon,40mm and 25mm munitions) - the thing is DESIGNED to take out targets in an urban environment, from high up. Then there's the assortment of air/gas bombs and laser guided munitions that a fighter could carry. My jaw dropped to the floor when I saw infantry SHOOTING at this 10-story monster with M4s and AR-15s..RIFLES?? Then it dropped again when I saw a mobile howitzer (I think it was a M109A6 Paladin) shooting at the monster?? Hmm, let's see, I can deploy the Spectre with its 105mm Cannon or put troops on the ground with a mobile howitzer and its 155mm cannon - to get stepped on..Unbelievably stupid..

More Military Problems - Why would the evac chopper pilot fly low over a free fire zone directly across the monster's path?? That was completely stupid. This screenplay needed alot of work..

1587575,2,B00005JPXY,"I personally think there were a lot of problems with this one.  The person holding the camera for most of the movie was insanely annoying.  Even during the disaster, he was making jokes and saying things like ""ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB,"" and ""You guys see that?"" The monster was continuously being attacked by machine guns, missles, and bombs and it never got a scratch.  Throughout the movie, wherever the main characters were, so was the monster.  How could the monster ""know"" where they were all the time?  During the rescue attempt, the chopper flies close above the monster; how dumb can you be?  Since you only see what the video camera sees, a lot of the story is left out and you only know what the person holding the camera knows; therefore, nothing is explained at all.

1587576,5,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is one of those movies that everyone seems split about. Half the people who watch it hate, the other half love it. And I suppose there a little percentage in the middle who are neutral.
I, personally, thought it was genius. It's been a very long time since I saw a monster movie that not only kept me interested, but made me research it when I got home from the theatre.
If you're interested, the sheer amount of supplimental content on the internet is astounding. Numerous blogs created by characters, websites from evil corporations, and the group trying to take them down.
Featureswise, this DVD isn't anything amazing. It has a few hidden easter eggs, but not much to really clear up any mystery. If anything, it made me question a little bit more.
This film is not, in any way, for people who get motion sickness. It's done in a handheld, 'shakycam' style, making it seem more real.
If you can handle all the movement and whatnot, and like a good monster movie, I highly recommend this to you.",1210550400,2,1010,4.585635359116022
1587577,2,B00005JPXY,"I realize that any review is very subjective, but with this one I just had to write a movie review which is not part of my normal nature.  When it comes to movies, I would consider myself a purest, so when I find myself fast forwarding through a DVD, I feel I must speak out.  I have only seen one commentary (or how they did it), so I have no real idea on what the people who made this were thinking.
At first blush, 'Cloverfield' looks like another remake of 'Godzilla' which takes place in Manhattan, NY. However, instead of a story line shot from many different views (as a usual story), it is shot from the view of a home video camera, trying to capture what was happening to several friends during a disaster of epic proportion.  If you thought the 'Blair Witch Project' was the best movie you had ever seen, you will be blown away by 'Cloverfield', but if you think 'Blair Witch' was a looser, you still might still enjoy this version of ""How to waste 85 minutes of electrons, without really trying"".
If you can get past the first 45 minutes or so, it does become more suspenseful and entertaining.  I must say they did not fall for the old mistake of creating a monster(s) and then showing too much of it, which leaves much more to the imagination and heightens the scare factor.  Hindsight being 20-20, this film would have been much more enjoyable if the Handycam had image stabilization (yes I know they did not really use a Handycam). The camera man was way to much a 'whiner' and had me wasting more time waiting for him to get smushed and replaced, than concentrating on the dialogue and story line.  The idea a character could suffer life threatening wounds and then they simply run away like a fresh marathon runner was a bit campy, but at least (unlike present day Hollywood) they portrayed the US Military as human beings trying to do the best job they know how, which is very atypical at this point in time.

Ground breaking? Maybe, but they should have buried it deep after they broke the ground.",1210464000,,2016,4.4471544715447155

You sure gotta' give those New Yorkers props for resilience.  If they aren't doing battle with space aliens, a bio-engineered plague, or a global warming-inspired ice age, they're fending off some nondescript creature that's come out of nowhere to lay waste to large sections of Lower and Midtown Manhattan.  And, indeed, after ""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" and now ""Cloverfield,"" one begins to wonder just how much abuse one little island should be expected to take before finally crying uncle.

Blending the content of ""Godzilla"" with the style of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the makers of ""Cloverfield"" relate their story entirely through the use of a handheld camera, as a group of twenty-something friends have their cocktail party rudely interrupted by the sudden appearance of a monster capable of tipping over skyscrapers and squashing cars as if they were bugs.  The movie follows a remnant of partygoers as they wend their way through the smoky chaos of the ruined city, with one of them recording the horrors and devastation on a camcorder as he goes.

Despite having a relatively low budget for a film of this type, ""Cloverfield"" does a remarkable job in blending CGI graphics with home video technology.  It may be true that the inky blackness of the nighttime setting helps to cover a multitude of special effects sins (some viewers may be frustrated by the murky indistinctiveness of the monster itself), but, on the whole, director Matt Reeves, cinematographer Michael Bonvillain, editor Kevin Stitt, and a team of highly talented FX and production artists are to be commended for achieving so much with so little.

The advantage of the you-are-there approach that the filmmakers have adopted is that it makes the audience feel more a part of the actual event than if the story were given a slicker, more conventional presentation.  Suffice it to say there's no Will Smith here slapping on a flight suit and zooming off into the wild blue yonder to duke it out mano-a-mano with the creature and singlehandedly save the world.  These are ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and it`s no coincidence that much of the imagery is clearly intended to evoke memories of 9/11.  After all, a world where post-apocalyptic paranoia runs rampant is no place for conventional action heroes.  Therefore, the verisimilitude of the piece is greatly enhanced by the use of relatively unknown players in the key roles (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel).

The disadvantage of this 1st person-restricted approach is that it occasionally leads to repetitiveness in the storytelling, with even the gimmick itself threatening to wear out its welcome quicker than the monster himself does.  The narrow focus is also liable to drive some viewers crazy by not providing any kind of resolution or explanation to neatly wrap things up at the end (to me, this is a strength rather than a weakness).

Finally, theatergoers who were rendered nauseated by the nonstop bobbing-and-weaving camerawork on the big screen should know that the effect is much less vomit-inducing when viewed on TV.

The characters and their relationships may be no more than mere window dressing placed at the service of the story, but that really doesn't matter, for in the case of ""Cloverfield,"" the filmmaking itself is the star.",1210377600,,3420,5.102150537634409

Blair Witch Project and Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon come to mind.

this style of filming has been one of the best ideas in horror, because there are no other styles that make the terror and action feel so real. there were multiple times i got chills down my neck from this movie. its just.. intense.

but.. without the camerawork, it is little more than another monster movie, which isn't a bad thing. it would still be leagues above most in the genre.

it takes a little time to get to know the characters in the opening scenes. i found most of the characters very believable and engaging. i actually cared about their everyday lives, and past together.(the first time in a while a was fearing for characters lives. i usually like the ""villains"") it turns out one of our main characters is leaving to live in china or something for a while, and theres a surprise going away party for him. nows about the time to buckle your seatbelt..

simply put, this movie blew me away. the camera style locks you in for the ride, and won't let go till its over. my heart was racing throughout 90% of the movie. you really are right there with them, dealing with the situation in front of you.. it could be the wildest ride you ever have on the couch.",1210291200,86,1544,4.4070175438596495

Well done!

Still, questions linger.  How did a creature this big make its way into Gotham?  It's too big for the subway.  Did it fly in on the Delta Shuttle?  Or, perhaps more likely, came from New Jersey.

It's vision of disaster aftermath also stirs painful memories of 9/11 as dust and paper fall like snowflakes from the sky.

I smell a sequel coming and hopefully this time they will hire a steadier cameraman but then it will be just another Godzilla movie and Lord knows we could always use another Godzilla movie.

A gaggle of irritating Yuppies have come to bid a fond farewell to one of their friends who has accepted a job in Japan (home of Godzilla, natch). The idea of a hand-held camera, brutally beaten to death in The Blair Witch Project a few years ago, works very well here, as the lens is small enough to capture only parts of what is happening as the Big Apple gets chewed, making the audience's imagination do all of the work. And, as the early Universal horror films used the horrific memories of the maimed and tortured from World War I, Cloverfield uses the memories of the destruction wrought by 9/11. The conceit of the amateur video---no music, just stark reality---brings immediacy to the proceedings that really work.

1587817,4,B00005JPXY,"I was eagerly awaiting this film, especially given the secrecy surrounding its main themes prior to its theatrical release: was it another 'aliens invade the U.S.' flick or what? We now have *some* of the answers!

First things first: if you suffer from motion sickness, you may want to give this film a pass. Adventurous director-and-producer team Matt Reeves and J.J. Abrams make use of the camcorder-POV and give Blair Witch Project a real run for its money. They add realism to this POV by showing us snippets of a video two of the main characters Rob Hawkins and Beth MacIntyre (Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman) shot about a month before being recorded over by accident. I started to call this review *BWP Meets Godzilla*, but that seemed like a cheap shot that doesn't do justice to an interesting, creative, and disconcerting flick that has gained a substantial cult following.

For the first 18 minutes, little of interest happens unless you're into lower Manhattan upscale yuppie drama: Rob's going away party takes a downturn when Beth (from the earlier video) shows up with another guy. Suddenly, everything begins shaking and the lights flicker. Hud (T.J. Miller) - the guy with the camcorder - focuses our attention shakily on a news broadcast reporting that a tanker has capsized near the Statue of Liberty. The group goes to the roof to see if they can see anything. An explosion south of them sends flaming debris raining across the sky driving them back indoors and down to street level.

Moments later is one of this film's best special effects, as the badly damaged head of the Statue of Liberty careens down into the street in front of them. In the distance, the Woolworth Building collapses. The group is driven back indoors again by the wall of dust and debris. Hud's camcorder caught something nasty moving into the city, prompting an ""It's alive!"" What is it?

As the plot unfolds, we learn: a creature the size of a skyscraper has attacked the city. From the character Marlena (Lizzy Caplan): ""It's eating people!"" The group makes a sensible decision to get out, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge with a crowd of evacuees. Rob is trying to contact Beth on his cell. He learns that she is trapped in her apartment, injured and unable to move. Then a more immediate tragedy strikes: the creature attacks and knocks out a portion of the bridge's support structure, sending a large portion of the Brooklyn Bridge down into the river. Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) is killed.

Rob again reaches Beth. He wants to rescue her. An argument ensues over the wisdom of this, but Rob - feeling guilty about how he'd treated her earlier - convinces the group to attempt a rescue. Their odyssey takes them through a subway station and into a tunnel where they must fight off nasty-looking parasites that ""fell"" from the larger creature. Marlena is bitten. At the other end they encounter a military unit that is evacuating the city. While in their makeshift facility, Marlena comes to a bloody end. Rob wants to leave for Beth's place. Those in charge of the facility won't stop him, but everyone leaves at 0600 the following morning. Be back or be trapped in the ruined city.

To shorten this account, the group reaches Beth - in her badly damaged apartment building they must access through the roof from a neighboring tower. She has been impaled through her shoulder on a piece of rebar. They rescue her, then make their way back to the street and to where the helicopters are leaving.

Do Rob and Beth make it out of the city? Watch the film! But bewarned: the helicopter scene is particularly dizzying, and then something happens that will make you jump ten feet. Yes, we get a close-up of the monster before it chows down on our hapless camcorder operator. The camcorder-POV has enabled Matt Reeves to direct this film in a stream-of-immediacy mode, freeing him of the need to explain what the creature is or where it came from. (The Wikipedia entry for this movie tells us that during the final clip of the earlier, recorded-over video, an object can be seen falling from the sky. I watched that scene over and over, but couldn't see anything.)

I have a few problems with the film, which explains the lack of five stars. (1) Rob has just lost his brother. Would he even be thinking about rescuing a girl he spent one night and one day with? (2) The other characters seem oddly nonchalant about Marlena's bite, as nasty-appearing as the parasites themselves. (3) Beth had been impaled on a piece of rebar in her apartment. I can't see three people simply lifting her off of it, followed by her getting up and joining them in getting out of the building and to a waiting helicopter. It is much more likely she would be in too much pain for that, and would lie there until she bled to death. (4) My biggest complaint: I have trouble visualizing a guy running through the streets, fending off attacking parasites, leaping across a debris-encumbered roof, etc., while filming everything on a camcorder.

None of these complaints need prevent your enjoyment of a nice combination of elements with more than a few genuine scares! I'm already hearing rumors about a Cloverfield 2 going into production.",1209686400,3,5215,4.766334440753045

The only reason I give this film a four is that the ending is far too vague.  One does not know if the creature is killed or is still romping around Central Park and New York City.

1587821,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield comes off a pretty decent run in theaters and into our homes on  DVD. I enjoyed this movie in the theater and felt that it did a pretty good job in creating a true-to-life enactment of New York City being attacked by a giant monster of unknown origin and what it would be like to experience something like that first hand. Even on DVD, the urgency of the film's storytelling style manages to come through and even though I had already watched the film prior and it was lacking the jarring effect of seeing it on a huge screen, it still managed to strike a chord of uneasiness with me, helped to no end by several shots which serve to remind the viewer of the tragic events of 9/11. Many people had a problem with the ""shakycam"" style of the film which bears more than a striking resemblance to the mayhem that was ""The Blair Witch Project"". The shakycam in this flick didn't really bug me as much as it did some other folks but to some it may be intolerable. You may want to keep this detail in mind if you suffer from motion sickness in any way. Also of annoyance to some was the cast of twenty-something hipsters who get little to no background development in the film and exist solely to get it in any number of different ways. I sort of agree with the consensus on this but hey, I didn't come to watch a Generation X (or whatever generation this is) angst fest, I came to see New York get destroyed by a giant monster, and that I definitely got. All in all, I think the film is at least worth a watch, especially if you like the giant monster movies of old.

The film is presented very well with great picture and great sound. When the military attacks the creature early on, you'll feel like you're in the middle of a live firefight and it's one of the films best moments. It's kind of funny to think that you'd get a full Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix off of something that is basically supposed to be shot with a home video camera but hey, I won't say anything if you don't.

Watching the bonus features on the disc, I've walked away from it with even more respect for the film. There are docs on the making of the film and some behind the scenes stuff on the special effects which was mind blowing. I was surprised to learn that most of the film was shot in L.A. and that most of the New York scenes were done with bluescreen. Watching the film, the effects blend in seamlessly and the featurette shows just how much painstaking detail went into these scenes. I'd definitely recommend this as must-see viewing to fans of the film. The commentary is worth a listen and contains some interesting insight into the films genesis and production.

In the end, it comes down to this: I wouldn't recommend this disc to the many people who could not stand this film. There's nothing here that will make anyone who hated it the first time around enjoy it this time. I liked it and have no problem recommending it to the people who did though.

Just one thing: that fantastic teaser trailer that played before Transformers, the one that worked up all that buzz for the film? Nowhere on this disc, unless it's an easter egg that I missed. Kinda strange not to include it, if you ask me.",1209600000,2,3195,4.354026845637584

1587823,4,B00005JPXY,"It's always nice to see someone in Hollywood take chances and move outside normal filming practices. Although CLOVERFIELD isn't wholly original, it does have an original feel thanks to the incredibly myopic look the audience gets via its length through one camera lens.

Labeled as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, Cloverfield definitely incorporates portions of both but comes out the other end as its own animal.

The myopic view was seen, as stated earlier, in The Blair Witch Project, which had a handheld camera being buoyed around by an amateur film maker, allowing the viewer to get up-close and personal with the story. With Cloverfield, we get the same experience but with a bit more high-tech status along the way. New York skyscrapers crumble and explode. The head of lady liberty comes hurtling down the street. The Brooklyn Bridge gets twisted and ripped apart like tissue paper. And the ""monster"" causing all this ...well ...you'll have to see that for yourself. I will say, however, that it was nice to only get glimpses of the creature and its `offspring' since that is the way it would truly happen if viewed through one person's eyes.

Which brings us to the Godzilla aspects of the film. Japan has that monster, and J.J. Abrams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>) gives us a new American one here. Unique is size, shape, and color, this new beast is just as tough to kill as Godzilla and has many smaller monsters (about the size of a regular dog) that it sheds like lice. And you don't want to get bitten by one of these lice; trust me! The more unique and intriguing thing about this new creature is that we know nothing about it since the story is all coming from one herky-jerky camera lens. Alien? Radioactive giant? Government experiment gone wrong? Who knows. This added to the realism of the story.

Although I understand the need for character development, I felt that the opening 20 minutes dragged on a bit too long. The love story between Jason (Mike Vogel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumor-Has-It/dp/B000EMGICS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumor Has It</a>) and Beth (Odette Yustman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>) added to the story in the end but was overly forced upon us in the beginning (""We get it! They're in love already!"")

Two other notable items must be mentioned. The first is the realism of the camera movements and the klutzy guy who carries it named Hudd (comedian T.J. Miller). Although why he continued to carry it sometimes bordered on ludicrous, his dopey demeanor helped make this easier to swallow. The second item is the sound quality. Absolutely amazing! The thumps, bumps, and explosions were an awesome thing to hear, and the dolby digital sound quality really shone through.

Certainly something to watch on a big screen TV with a great sound system. This one is sure to please monster movie afficionados.",1209600000,11,3401,6.045643153526971
1587924,2,B00005JPXY,"I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm simply expecting way too much out of movies these days.

From scene to scene, I excitedly awaited for the movie to FINALLY get going. The extremely lengthy character development ultimately proved to be utterly pointless filler.  Aside from some refreshing special effects and military coverage, all I got were letdowns. With such incredible special effects, particularly the military dealing with the creature (and the creature(s) themselves), I cannot believe how stupid that movie was. That's why I have dubbed it ""The Blair Godzilla Project"" - a bunch of nothing leading up to a nothing ending.  Even worse, this movie can be mercilessly picked apart.  I'll only mention a few things:

1. Virtually zero originality in the movie.

2.  WAY too much lame character development (utterly useless filler), way too little of why people went to see the movie.

3.  Another brainless ""everybody freaks out because nobody's older than 30"" movie.

Those are just the minor flaws.  Here's a few to really sink teeth into:

Major Hit 1a:  I want to know what brand of video camera that annoying, needing-to-be-punched buffoon was holding. Any camera that can be dropped multiple times, including from about 300 feet (the headless cameraman scene near the end) and still continue to maintain perfect digital clarity at a professional camera level - but affordable enough for 20-somethings to buy them for recording beer bashes - I definitely want one.

Major Hit 1b:  ATTENTION HOLLYWOOD:  We're sick of ""jerky camera""!  Put the camera back in the hands of a professional, please.  Or at least recognize the fact that today's kids are experts at using handheld technology such as video cameras.  ""Different"" isn't always progress or good.  Sometimes it sucks.  Watching an entire movie where you're virtually unable to focus your eyes or get a good look at ANYTHING is beyond frustrating.  All that wasted money on effects you never get to see more than a glimpse of is just tragic.  What a loss to the work the special effects team did and what a loss to the audience.

Major Hit 2:  Stupid scenes galore. For example, as the military is bombing the creature via B-2 Stealth Bomber, the presumably preoccupied creature (preoccupied with getting bombed) jumps up out of the blast cloud and takes a snap not at the B-2 bomber, but at the harmless camera in the harmless helicopter they're flying in overhead. Yeah, that's remotely plausible and makes sense.  Or the headless cameraman scene - out of an entire city where the creature has been rampaging all night with the US military swarming around it the entire time, the creature just happens to annoyingly and repetitively (and even QUIETLY) pop up on their location and take them by surprise while the military ""loses"" the 300-foot creature long enough for nearly the entire ending of the movie to unfold.

Major hit 3:  The greatest failure of the movie was the dropped ball on the smaller spider creatures, which were actually taken straight out of ""Starship Troopers"" with virtually zero alteration to avoid plagiarism (one of my all time favorite movies that begged to have a sequel made and never got one). I got really excited when I saw them, thinking the movie was FINALLY about to get much better. They had a GREAT creep factor, especially the ""bitten girl exploding"" scene. WAY cool. Though the movie overall is extremely unoriginal, there were still some opportunities to really jazz the movie up and get it moving, the spider creatures being the biggest.  But alas, the letdowns continued and the smaller spider creatures simply disappeared for the rest of the movie.  Poof - gone.  Stupid.  One dropped ball after another.

Major Hit 4:  That ending. Egad.  My wife and I, huge sci-fi connesseurs, were stunned at the lame ending.  I don't require the good guys to win at the end, but a whole movie full of nothing only to wind up with a nothing ending that was a shamelessly obvious setup for a sequel is downright unacceptable. The end actually left us sitting there looking at each other with our jaws hanging open in disbelief. ""You're kidding!""  I can't see how this movie isn't insulting to any thinking human being. This is where it REALLY turned into the Blair Godzilla Project, same exact ending as Blair Witch. I cannot believe the ZERO-originality factor of this movie compared to how many people are impressed by it.  With movie audiences so easily fooled, I should be working as a writer in Hollywood.  Just by not ripping off other movies, I'd be hailed as the new Speilberg and would be best friends with M. Night Shyamalan.

The most aggrivating part for me is bittersweet, so I can't list it as a major hit because it's based on what they got right.  That is, all the filmmaking elements to make this movie absolutely fantastic were there! SO CLOSE to getting it right!  This is hugely frustrating.  The special effects were stunning, the creature itself was fantastic, the realism of the destruction was beautifully done, and even the acting was actually very good (despite my disgust over wimpy/weepy male roles, but I have to remind myself that the movie is about NYC yuppies). And the military scenes were top-notch incredible. EXTREMELY realistic, in fact, something most sci-fi movies totally fail at (like the recent ""War Of The Worlds"", which is downright insulting to anybody in the military that's actually seen combat). What they got right in this movie was stunningly right.  What they got wrong is what's tragic, because it's so overwhelmingly wrong that it ruins the movie.

The concept of a Godzilla theme is so overwhelmingly cool that it is regularly re-attempted at least once every decade.  This movie is just the latest attempt.  Huge progress was made, but combined with huge mistakes.  It could have reighned supreme as the mother of all Gozilla movies.  Sadly, it's yet another blown opportunity to get it right and yet another movie to throw into my ""yet another failed Godzilla attempt"" pile.

At least this one wasn't a liberalized ""misunderstood homeless pregnant mommy"" Godzilla who just needed to lay her eggs all over NYC.  I would have put the remote through the screen.",1209600000,3,6213,4.897607655502393

1587927,4,B00005JPXY,"I didn't get to see this film while it was in the theaters, but when it came to DVD, I puchased a copy without having to see the film.  I am a longtime lover of monster movies, especially the Godzilla series and like the filmakers I always felt America needed it's monster besides King Kong (and that ridiculouse excuse for a Godzilla movie in 1998).  What I found upon viewing was a very interesting approach to monster movie making.  I'm not altogether sure it works, but it still makes for a very entertaining 90 minutes.

I like the handheld camera approach, although it can be a bit hard to watch at times.  I understand that the filmakers had to take this approach because of buget constraints.  It was very interesting to see the whole disaster unfold from the eyes of the victims.  The problem that I have with this approach is that you don't get too many chances to get a really good look at the monster.  Perhaps if a sequel is made, they could mix the handheld footage with the regular style of filmaking.

Another problem I have is the cast with the exception of one girl was a complete waste.  I can't stand the fake pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-trendy and ultra snooty young New Yorkers and to have to suffer through these fools for the first 20 minutes was almost nauseating.  Hud was the absolute worst of the bunch and I did not find him the least bit funny.  Maybe next time out we can get a cast of characters that the public will actually care about.

My final problem with the movie is the design of the monster.  With the way the Cloverfield monster was designed along with the color scheme they used, it's hard to tell what's an arm, what's a leg, is that a tentacle?, and where's the head.  I think the monster needed a little more defining.

Now that all of the bad stuff is out of the way, I thought this was an exceptional monster movie and I would gladly see a sequel.  There's some very real moments of terror and the scenes of devastating destruction are just amazing, especially lady liberty's head rolling down the street.

I would recommend this movie to any monster movie fan.  It may have it's problems, but it may also be the start of a wonderful thing.",1209513600,3,2188,4.452261306532663

They probably did not have enough money to produce this movie so they hide their ill conceived ideas behind artistic license.

1587929,1,B00005JPXY,"First, the simple ""sound bite"": Hated it!

Now, for a bit more commentary....

This ""movie"" represented--to me at least--much of what I think is wrong with the current state of ""television entertainment."" The fact that this work was represented as a ""movie"" (rather than as a long episode of a ""Reality TV"" show) was its only real novelty. I can summarize the good and the bad aspects of this work as follows:

The Good
1- It wasn't too long.
2- The CGI effects of the monsters and the destruction of NYC were surprisingly good.
3- There was some excitement generated by some of the scenes (although in each case they were cliques that were not original ideas by any means).
4- Ah, I was able to rent it for free (I had a coupon).

The Bad

1- It seemed really, really long (and was mostly boring except when the CGI was in full bloom). I suppose that perhaps a case could be made for fast-forwarding through the DVD just to see the CGI scenes.

2- Although the monster part of the story was a tiny bit novel, the ""characters"" and their dramas were not at all interesting or original. Of course, for a generation that's used to the depth of drama in most so-called ""Reality TV"" shows, the ""script"" made perfect sense. Watch the party scene (if you can stomach it) for a second or even third time. Then try to imagine how these characters and their motivations might be portrayed in a ""real"" movie with a real script and real actors. See? This is very-dumb-made-for-Reality-TV stuff could never be translated into a proper dramatic movie. Of course, this is one reason why the producer (the ""Lost"" guy) could get away with making this movie...he didn't need to spend any money on actors or a scriptwriter because he knew so much would be ""forgiven"" because it would, after all, be ""seen"" by the viewers as being ""filmed"" by a kid using a hand-held HD camcorder. Neat, huh?

3- Speaking of ""scripts"" (or the lack thereof), the characters are made to do some really stupid things for some really stupid reasons. There are some very large plot holes throughout, too. The simple motivation of the main male character (the guy who suddenly says ""I've got to go back and get my girlfriend in spite of the fact it will mean all our deaths including my brother who was killed before my eyes"") was needed to keep all the characters in the line of fire. But the fact that the three follow-along characters are actually dumb enough to go along with the ""hero"" simply shows (to me) how stupid kids are today. At the very least, the script is making a cynical comment in assuming that teenagers (or 20-somethings) can be expected to act like sheep in such a ""disaster.""

4- The fact that the lights stay on (nearly everywhere) in spite of the major damage being done to NYC is a very-hard-to-believe plot device. But the plot device of the cellphone that works well enough (and several times at that) to allow the trapped girl to call her boyfriend and plead for his help is absolutely beyond belief. But, again, to the intended audience who are literally tied to their cellphones and iPods and who generally don't care how those things actually work (i.e., they are little radios that depend on big radios working) it makes perfect sense. That is, the expectation of a suspension of disbelief by the intended audience is logical, but only in a cynical sense.

5- Regarding the long sequence of the three characters climbing up the stairs to the top of a building and then jumping over to the almost-ready-to-collapse building in which the hero's ""girl"" is trapped because she is impaled on a piece of rebarb....wow, I'm almost breathless just from trying to explain the crazy plot! As I mentioned earlier, the tag-along characters are represented as sheep who (in spite of an opportunity to get out of town with the military) are willing to follow their ""hero"" just so they can fill some time or ""hang with him"" or be there to capture his heroics on video....(wow: breathless again). Well, here these people are no longer characters--they become actors in a scripted scene. At this point, the audience will ""believe"" anything, therefore the characters can be made to ""do anything"" without regard for their safety or sanity or--dare I say it?--basic physics in the real world. My point here is that because of all the stupid things the kids have done so far in the story we expect (and actually we need) the characters to be able to safely rescue the poor girl (who oddly isn't dead from a loss of blood and who survives being pulled off the metal rebarb that is holding her and can actually manage to walk down the building with ease...). Once they all get back into the building they climbed up in I thought for one vain moment that there was hope that one of the small monster creatures would grab the hurt girl (or all of them for that matter) and stab her to death. If that happened at least there'd be some irony in this story. But no, the secondary hero (who actually is killed later by the big bad monster itself) is able to put the camera down long enough to kill the nasty small monster. And then they all move along nicely and quickly to the bottom floor and out the building. Sweet. What a cool story. Makes perfect sense. No trouble at all; they saved the dude's girl. Naturally.

6- The camera work throughout was both bad and good. It was good in the sense that it captured some of the ""reality"" of a hand-held camera. But, it was bad in the sense that the kid who was operating the camera couldn't have captured the actual video that was shown (i.e., the video was ""too good"" too much of the time). Of course, if this ""video"" were shown as being truly ""Blair Witch"" quality, no one would have watched this movie all the way through. [We have to have some standards you know. This is a movie of the week! We want people to think it is real but not too real!]

7- The resolution of the story (i.e., everyone dies except the one girl who, presumably, gets out on the first helicopter) is so typical of all of today's end-of-the-world scripts. The hero/heroine die for no reason really except because it's in the script. Come on...what happened to the dramas of yesteryear? In the past (before 9/11), stories of the end of the world (from whatever cause) would end in an emotionally satisfying way: that is, most or at least some of the main characters would survive due to their actions or dumb luck. But they survived. We want them to survive....that's the point of these stories. If you don't believe me, go back and study the history of movies and TV scripts (in this genre at least). The hero/heroine survives somehow. Sadly, in the ""Post 9/11"" scriptwriters guide, everyone (except a random one or two) will die. all these stories end up repeating the ""point"" of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And that point is this: most will die, it doesn't matter what anyone tries to do...or is made to do by the scriptwriters...they will die. One or two will randomly be saved, but that salvation has no meaning except for pure chance. And that's where I will end this commentary: this ""Reality-TV"" version of the 9/11 attack on NYC is lame. Skip it.",1209513600,9,7140,4.561622464898596
1587930,3,B00005JPXY,"Anyone seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-2000-Millennium/dp/B00003CXLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla 2000: Millennium</a>&nbsp;or played the video game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-Save-the-Earth/dp/B00024W1TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla: Save the Earth</a>? Boy, if the Cloverfield monster isn't the spittin' image of the monster (Orga) that Godzilla battles in that movie and that game, then the Cloverfield monster is Orga's cousin for sure.

And the Cloverfield monster deals out some serious damage on NYC, just like Orga would (or Godzilla would for that matter). And indeed, Godzilla was the inspiration for Cloverfield according to comments in the Special Features of the DVD by Producer JJ Abrams (also producer of the TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0017HZZP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alias/dp/B000H5V8DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alias</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Felicity/dp/B0009SW83A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Felicity</a>).

Cloverfield succeeds as a cool monster movie, but the shake, rattle and roll of the handheld camera in which the entire movie is viewed make for a miserable viewing experience. Sure, it adds an element of realism, but it is the most memorable part of the movie. In other words, the annoying handheld camera work is so distracting that it takes away from the story that is trying to break through all the jiggling.

The acting is TV actor caliber (no surprise: the movie's chock full of TV actors and it has a TV director), but works pretty well from the perspective that the movie is being told (at least the acting was better than in a Godzilla movie!!!). Cloverfield almost seems like an episode of ""Felicity in the City Meets the Monster."" This is not to say that I still was not highly entertained.

A sequel to Cloverfield has been announced for a potential 2009 release. Let's just hope that Abrams stabilizes the picture for those movies. Let's also hope that the sequel is more about the monster and the forces battling it (like the way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;evolved out of the original), and less about the TV actors and their experiences.",1209513600,3,2534,7.190938511326861
1587931,5,B00005JPXY,"Upon walking out of the theater after having seen Cloverfield, I was dumb-founded with how amazing the movie was. Not to mention the amount of adrenaline that was going through my body, which rarely occurs, and I love the rush!

Just a note to those who saw it in theaters, if you got a headache or nausiated, I ensure you that the movie is easier to watch on a smaller screen and if you had your doubts about the movie after seeing in theaters due to those feelings, I urge you to watch it again on a smaller screen.

Anyways, as far as the movie goes, it was just simply outstanding. The story, the characters, the acting, everything! They took a Godzilla concept and threw in a twist of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and added a shot of steriods. The result of how they created the movie was so real, it was presented to make it seem like it actually happened, making you more intruiged. The movie easily made it to my Top 5 movie list!",1209513600,3,935,4.306818181818182
1587932,4,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is something of a novelty film: it doesn't really have much to add to the horror genre, but should definitely be watched nonetheless.  According to the ""making-of"" documentary, the filmmakers were wanting to create an ""American Godzilla.""  Well, they didn't.  But what they DID do is create a film that is certainly a worthwhile watch, that does have something to say, even if it doesn't quite reach the expectations the filmmakers set out for.

The movie starts out at a goodbye party.  A young man (names are inconsequential, we'll get to that in a moment) is heading to Japan (they didn't make their homages very subtle, did they?).  A friend-who-is-more-than-a-friend shows up at his party (with another guy), then promptly leaves.  While our main character is mourning, something happens.  The earth shakes.  They race to the top of their building.  There's an explosion.  They race down to the street.  The head of the Statue of Liberty rolls by.  They race to the Brooklyn Bridge.  They race...

They race around.  Except for an interesting sequence where they're stuck on a subway platform.  But basically, they're racing.  Which is good--because, if these characters stuck around anywhere for long, we wouldn't give a rat's petoot what happened to them.  The acting wasn't all that bad, really--it's just, the characters weren't likeable.  The movie started out like a soap opera, but that is a bit of a necessity--it MUST start out mundane, for us to realize the significance of what is going on.  If only the characters were interesting...

Nevermind.  The star here is the monster.  And the cinematography.  I've seen complaints that the camera work is too jerky; well, no kidding.  In order to capture what this event would really be like (don't want monsters, okay, substitute a terrorist attack), we must see it through the eyes of the characters involved.  Or, rather, the eyes of ONE character involved--in this case, Hud, a funnyman who is charged with filming the evening's events (then decides to document everything else when the proverbial you-know-what hits the proverbial fan).  This is where ""Cloverfield"" earns its worth--it a horror story told uniquely ONLY from the point of view of the victims...and not even that, but a small group of victims, arguably ONE victim.  It is a movie about a global event told through the eyes of a single character.  If for that reason alone, ""Cloverfield"" will get your mind and blood racing.  Just like its characters.",1209427200,10,2494,5.009756097560976

1588024,4,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is a good movie. It is the best use of the ""Blaire Witch"" method since ""The Blaire Witch Project"" itself. This style keeps the movie from being just a 21st Century ""Gozilla"" remake, which would have to have been as bad as all other ""Godzilla"" sequals and remakes. Here, you are always in contact with the human situation and their disasterous plight - Nevermind if this stuff could ever happen. Who were all those people running through Tokyo streets in all those ""Godzilla"" movies anyways? How many close calls, and phone calls, did those guys make before getting squished by godzilla monsters? I bet they each had a back story. And who cares about a godzilla's back story or motivation? City-leveling, malevolant monsters are unsympathetic brutes and do not get a say. Maybe this movie isn't for everyone, but it would not have been as powerful if shot in the normal way we are used to feature films. The special effects are good. The acting, pacing, also good. The terrible thing is shown enough. Any more footage of it would hurt the realism of the movie. I saw ""Cloverfield"" on a PC screen in relatively low-rez, and still got a kick out of it.

1588025,4,B00005JPXY,"Instead of using traditional movie camera film, the producers of ""Cloverfield"" decided to rely instead on film from a hand-held camcorder to shoot the scenes of the movie.  The result is a fairly scary film, but the camcorder filming is very difficult to watch.

As for the movie itself, Rob (Michael Stahl-David) has just received a cushy new job in Japan.  Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) have decided to throw Rob a surprise going away party.  As the guests begin to arrive, Jason asks his friend Hud (T.J. Miller) to videotape some goodbye messages for Rob.  Among the guests is Rob's ex-girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman), who has shown up with her new boyfriend.  Also there is Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).  Rob and Beth get into a heated argument, and she and her boyfriend leave the party.

Just as the party's beginning to get going, a loud noise occurs outside and all of the lights in Manhattan suddenly go dark.  Something very large has begun an all-out assault on the city.  The startled guests run outside to see a large creature destroying buildings, vehicles and other people. Instead of running away from the creature, Rob, Jason, Lily, Marlena and Hud decide to try to rescue Beth, who's apartment is in mid-town and just happens to be directly in the path of the creature.  Hud has also kept the camcorder running.  What results is a frantic trek across mid-town Manhattan in a desparate search to save Beth before the creature gets there first.  Will Rob and his friends survive, or will the creature get them?

I thought this movie was scary in some parts, but I had a difficult time watching due to the constant jumping of the film.  I thought that the camcorder idea was interesting, but it did make viewing the movie much more difficult than if it would have been filmed in a normal manner.  Also, I was disappointed that I never got a real clear look at the creature.  I thought that the special effects were pretty good, especially the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street.

1588026,3,B00005JPXY,"The main gripe that i have with the movie obviously is the handy cam that they used throughout the movie.  The story was alright mixed with a bit of action as well.  But its too freakin annoying to spend an hour and a half watching this bounce all over the place missing shots and just making a mess of what could've been a half decent idea.  The monster that attacks the city....very, very scary (not really).

Apart from the sproadic action and other things.  Cloverfield just turned out to be a clever idea that didn't come close to equally the sum of its parts or the massive hype that it generated from pretty much all corners of the internet.  That being said i'm not disappointed with purchasing it, but given the opportunity again.  I would probably just rent and watch it for an hour and 20 minutes then promptly return it the next day.

None the wiser to the ending which i must say i didn't even come close to liking at all.  Word of advice if you love movies that have your stomach all over the place to the way a movie's shot this one is perfect for you.  Otherwise don't waste your money believe me.

Stylish and original Sci-fi horror thriller from J.J. Abrahams (""Transformers 2007"" and ""Lost"") is one of the most unique and stunning films in recent memory. It uses a mockumentary-esque feel to it and makes you feel like your part of the movie too with it's DV camera filmmaking and good performances by the cast. This movie plays as a semi-realistic homage to the monster movies of yore and Japan of course, the film is kind of gory at times for a PG-13 rated movie and it's a heart-pounding and suspenseful shocker that never lets go. The monster designs are quite cool even with the little parasitic creatures, this movie launched a major hype campaign before it was released thanks to a clever teaser and movie poster. The film became an instant success and got some critical acclaim, i can't wait for the sequel coming out next year.

1588028,2,B00005JPXY,"So, feeling like a big idiot for spending hard-earned cash to see this garbage film? Did they stamp the word ""Sucker!"" on your forehead as you left the theater? Bought the DVD? Worse yet, did you take a date to this movie and thereby ruined the occasion?

Fear not! You are not alone. Here's an easy way to recoup some lost dignity (though not your cash), maybe even gain a bit of respect: intellectualize and philosophize about it.

First, you must throw out the notion that you saw a horror-sci-fi-monster flick. No, no, no...what you experienced was actually symbolism, social commentary, and psychological analysis. Forget the puerile suggestions of a Sept. 11th allegory; you must delve much, much deeper than that.

Our cinematic journey begins in NYC's Central PArk West with a bit of morning-after nonsense involving our protagonist and this babe. They video tape a date to Coney Island (how quaint), then quickly moves to a SoHo loft party the following month. A lot has happened in the interim: our hero received an uber promotion in his company but this requires relocating to Japan; also, we are subtly informed that our hero and his girl friend have remained incommunicado since that one night stand the previous month. Why? Beats me, but for someone so savvy as to live in a SoHo loft, move up the corporate (we assume) ladder and land a dream job while still in his early twenties, he sure comes across as a Hamlet-esque dolt. But I digress.

On the occasion of this party we meet the next group of unidimensional characters- a ""how-dare-I-be-so-beautiful"" clique of upper echelon Obama voter types. In other words, just the sorta people you'd expect to live and party in SoHo. There's the best friend whose portable camera documents the events as they happen (in the process recording over the tape of the lovers' date to Coney Island, but more on that later). Then there's our hero's brother and two other babes, one of which is truly stunning.

Believe it or not, tension builds at the party (Say it ain't so, TGav!). Our protagonist feels chagrined that his former girlfriend arrives towing some Adonis looking dude and he lets her know it. She storms out. Our hero then wallows in self pity ""woe is me"" moment. Now the fun begins.

Far away explosions, the lights flicker. This being L.A. it must be earthquake...err.. NO...scratch that... This being Kansas it must be tornadoes... whoops..let's try again...this being NYC it must be terrorists. Okies, lets go with that. But of course this is not the case. We are teased with a glimpse of a tail here, a shadow there. Flaming debris falls from the heavens faster than you can say ""a screaming comes across the sky"". Pandemonium ensues. Everyone bolts to the streets below.

Now comes the ""money shot"" of this movie. IMO, a good 50% of gross ticket sales this movie made can be attributed to this one scene ubiquitous in trailers and commercials. Yes, none other than the Lady Liberty head conveniently landing scratched but otherwise intact despite the distance and velocity catapulted (they don't make statues like they used to) just as our heroes emerge outside. Sadly,the director neglected to include dead tourists mangled corpses visible in the crown, which is the statue's observation deck and usually full of people. Granted, the action took place late at night, but would've been a nice touch anyway. Maybe it can be CGed in the BluRay release. But I digress again.

Now, once we realize that what we have here is in fact a monster run amok in NYC and bent on mayhem and destruction, we could've had a nice formulaic H'wood flick. But nooooooo. The director instead turns cerebral and tries to learn us somethin. So furrow your brow, sport a concerned look as you slowly stroke your chin and ponder the double-secret meaning behind this waste of perfectly good celluloid (or videotape, as the case may be).

You see, life gets more complicated the older we are and full of bitter sacrifices. Despite his great professional gains our hero has lost his own liberty, the freedom of choice is kept in check by consequences, in this case abandoning his true love in order to seize an opportunity. He realizes this I think in the alley as they run. His friends, too, chose, to their detriment. Somethings sacrificed, however, cannot be undone. Just don't try to convince our hero of  that. Or his ditsy entourage.

And waht of the monster? What is it? Where did it come from? Notice its inexplicable appearance just after the girlfriend makes her exit and how it follows the group during their forlorn quest. Could it be a symbol of our hero's angst and inner turmoil of love lost never to be regained, of regrets, the chaos of his life in general despite its superficial attractiveness? In the brilliant 1985 movie ""Brazil"", the hero Sam Lowry fantasizes a battle against a giant Samurai warrior, which symbolizes suppressive totalitarianism. Similarly, this creature could be just a symbolic figment of the protagonist's imagination as he sits there morose and all at his own party pondering his past decisions.

Or perhaps he willed it to be real, to destroy the material world which entraps him. Much like in Ghost Busters, but instead of Mr. Stay Puft marshmallow sailor let lose in NY, this time it's the Mother-of-All-Sushi monster giving lower MAnhattan some payback. And how apropos the Godzilla analogy considering he's moving to Japan! Had it been PAris where he was going, I'd have expected millions of arrogant waiters materializing to ridicule everyone's taste in wine thus driving all Americans to suicidal madness. Not quite the dramatic effect though.

It kills his brother, his best friends, it destroys the only shred of innocence and happiness remaining in his life up until then. We see only a few moments here and there of the original tape recording they made in Coney Island when life was still simple and less grown up. Interestingly, this patchy broken glimpse into that day is about as much as we see of the creature itself. We can understand it but never appreciate it in full and uninterrupted.

And in the end? A sense of final happiness as the recording ends and the tape continues with the original footage of an earlier life. So does the indestructible monster finally die, defeated by the couple's admission of love? That depends if you're a romantic or an existentialist.

This was one lousy movie smartly but deceitfully marketed. It is nauseating not because of the faux-amateur hand-held camera technique, but rather by virtue of its amateurish acting, simpleton plot if taken at face value, and arrogant presentation. If I pay to see a brain dead monster flick, then please deliver what I want. I can get plenty of allegory from reading Dante, and there's plenty of honest experimental and enigmatic cinema out there without the need to ambush the public.

1588030,5,B00005JPXY,"The combination of both mystery and hype really intrigued me about Cloverfield before its release; I started seeing TV spots that hardly gave away anything and I saw posters of a headless statue of liberty all over New York City. I'm a huge fan of the TV show LOST, so when I heard the producer of this film was J.J. Abrams, (LOST's creator) I was immediately sold. I went to the theaters opening weekend with two of my friends (both who ironically have motion sickness) and from the moment the film started with the ""Classified"" screen, I was hooked.

From the moment things started going down in the city, I found it hard for my eyes to leave the screen and I was on the edge of my seat. What a thrilling experience! The FX of the monster was nearly flawess (in my opinion, if it looked phony or cheesy, this film would've failed. Period.) The ""Alien-esque"" spawns of the beast were also very well done (one of the characters meets a horrible fate due to one of them.) While my friends were a bit bothered by the shaky-cam, I wasn't annoyed in the slightest... it only added to the realism (like the Blair Witch Project, another movie I found to be creepy and unique.) I actually cared for the characters in this film and wanted them to make it out of this situation alive.

I read a LOT of negative reviews for this film on Amazon, to my surprise, but I guess it really is a love-it or hate-it film. I personally LOVED it and found it to be an exciting and different take on the over-done ""monster invades the city"" films. I felt as though I was in the movie, seeing everything through the eyes of the characters and the ending was perfect. Also, people are complaining about NO plot or not enough information given... um, yeah, that's sort of the point! We see only what the characters see which adds to the exciting mystery of it. It wouldn't make sense if a scientist appeared out of nowhere and explained everything about the monster (put clues together and build your own conclusion.)

If you haven't seen this yet, ignore all the hate and give it a try (with an open mind--and in a dark room with the volume cranked up.) Highly recommended.",1209340800,2,2149,4.449238578680203
1588031,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield is an interesting movie on many different levels. The movie is postmodern; delighting in pastiche and eclectic borrowing. The intrepid viewer quickly sees the affinity between Cloverfield, the Blair Witch, 1950s monster movies, traditional sci-fi, etc. This is not to be derided; it is to be applauded. There is certainly nothing wrong with using a syncretic blend of influences to create an original movie. I think the po-mo attitude is: ""Screw it, it has all been done before. We might as well be open about our borrowing.""
The use of a shaky cam in Cloverfield- alas Blair Witch and Bourne- was a smart move. It creates the intended nausea and vertigo. The psychological state created sets the tone for a fast pased, taut monster movie thriller. On a superficial level, then, the movie is a fairly straighforward and succesful one. No complaints.
On a more symbolic level, it seems fairly evident that the movie serves as a Post-9/11 statement on terrorism. The choice of Manhattan was not abitrary. Indeed, the fact that we never see the monster clearly is indicative of terrorism in general: who are we fighting against? Is terrorism as we percieve it even real? Cloverfield seems to be telling us that blind fear of the unknown drives our population to support wars and foreign adventures that might not be in our own interests. Clearly, in the movie, the military option is untenable and actually does more harm than good. Are we doing the same thing in the Middle East? Is creating a nebulous reification called terrorism, and fighting 'it', feasible, or are we just harking back to the days of the red menace? Whether or not the movie intended to be used as a political statement, the parrallelisms are limpid enough. Hey, it is a postmodern era, free readings of texts should be encouraged, right?

There is much more to this movie than meets the eye. However, what meets the eye is pretty darned entertaining. Did it live up to the hype? No. There is irony in this. Was the hype not manufactured on purpose through various media outlets: the internet, TV, radio, etc.? Are these not the same mediums that hype the ""War on Terror?"" Are either worthy of the hype? I do not think so. Do you think the people hyping this movie were not aware of this? I think they were clever enough to show us just how powerful the media is in our day.",1209340800,,2355,4.716019417475728
1588032,1,B00005JPXY,"This movie is sometimes really annoying.  If the creature was easily identified(i.e. Godzilla), this movie would have rocked!!!  Sadly,  it's some reject from a really bad B-movie.  Damn!!! So much potential thrown away....",1209340800,2,223,5.666666666666667
1588033,4,B00005JPXY,"First, you have to be aware of the one major complaint most people have concerning ""Cloverfield.""  It will give you a headache.  Likely a major one.  As the entire film is shot through a camcorder that one of the main characters (who is running for most of the movie) is holding, there are more ""wobbly"" scenes than not.  Does this take away from the film?  Maybe.  However, the idea of seeing this unexplained destruction through the eyes of a person just like us is fascinating enough to convince me that the headaches were worth it.  It might not be so for you, and I think that needs to be addressed.

Second, be ready for an amazing script.  Drew Goddard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy</a>&nbsp;alum) is at the top of his game, taking us effortlessly from dire soil-your-pants scenes to laugh-out-loud moments without missing a beat.  With dialogue like ""Cloverfield"" has, you'll certainly be quoting the one-liners very often.

Lastly, the execution of the script and the `idea' of ""Cloverfield"" is very impressive.  We get enough clear looks at the monster in question to satisfy the audience, but the true brilliance of this movie is that there is no explanation offered for the monster.  There is no ""he came from space"" or ""he burst forth from the deepest pit of the ocean"" nonsense.  The information we get is what we would get if we were in the main character's shoes, and that's the whole point of the movie.  I think it's fascinating.

So with a script this good and an idea so interestingly executed, I think this movie is definitely worth the (inevitable) headache.

1588112,3,B00005JPXY,"The ""shaky-cam"" has been mentioned by many of you.  I have friends who refuse to see this video because of it.  I personally didn't mind the shaking so much as the obvious attempts to make the camerawork look as bad as possible.

The movie opens at a party.  For the first 15 minutes of the film, there is no monster, yet I find this some of the most annoying camera work of the entire film.  Often times the camera is crooked.  This is SO unbelievable!  Hand a camera to anyone and ask them to film a bunch of people, I doubt the crooked camera happens.  Much more likely is trying to shoot somebody without looking at the viewfinder/ screen only to realize you're only capturing the bottom or side of their face.  Any amateur, in my opinion, would at least hold the camera somewhat upright.

So it's not only annoying, you know it's deliberately exaggerated, making it doubly annoying.

During many of the action scenes, the camera work actually gets better.  When somebody should be running for their lives, using both arms to run faster, the camera is actually more parallel with the ground than when they're sompelace quiet and safer.  I'm not buying it.  I expect the whole reason for this is that the action sequences are easier to animate and are more effective given a somewhat stable camera.

I guess the makers of this film also assume we're so used to so-called ""reality TV"" that people will just talk freely and don't mind the fact you've got a camera pointed at them.  That might happen after several days of being the subject of a reality TV show, but not in real life.  Why would anybody film everything their friends are going through?  Missing is the real reaction these people would have: ""Get that f---ing camera out of my face or I'll ...""!!!

And aren't there certain times where you'd just turn off the camera rather than be burdened with filming?  Like when the parasites are attacking you?  Maybe put down your camera and fight them off?

Thank goodness for what happens to the cameraman!  Why couldn't it have happened at least an hour earlier?

Other than that, the movie was good.  You got a real sense of the panic and the way things might happen.  It was a lot more chaotic than other ""large monster attacks city"" films, where the scientists and military are working together to destroy the monster.  This was a story of the people caught in the middle, not where the monster came from and how he dies.

I don't mind that his origins are unknown.  If something like this were to really happen, we wouldn't have all of the answers in the first 7 hours?  To me, it's scarier about not knowing.

If it just weren't for the amateur film angle, I think it would have been great.  I can see where the makers maybe thought it didn't bring anything new to the table and this was their way of doing that.  The story alone would have worked.  It's different in the fact that you didn't involve scientists and a military command center, just regular people.  But the shaky cam and unrealistic reactions of people took away from it.

Can other filmmakers learn a lesson on shaky-cam?",1209340800,,3101,4.544303797468355

1588117,2,B00005JPXY,"By the word ""trend"", I mean that it seems as if the new ""in"" thing to do in Hollywood films is to have a movie with no ending.

Just like ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Cloverfield"" starts off with an interesting premise, a great story, heart-stopping action.....and then everything abruptly ends.

What's worse, these ""endings"" aren't realy endings at all. Things happen and then they stop happening.

>>>POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO FOLLOW<<<

There is no plot resolution. We are left with so many questions. What WAS the creature attacking New York City? Where did it come from? Was the military able to defeat it? Did the 2 main protagonists survive? The biggest questions of all was ""What was the friggin' point to all of this?"".

One of the biggest gripes seems to have been the shaky camera and nonsensical edits throughout the film which was supposed to give a gritty realism to make the viewer think he or she was watching an amateur video recording of a horrifying event. This type of filming, which has been done before in ""The Blair Witch Project"", really didn't bother me and, to me, DID succeed in giving the film that ""gritty realism"".

The special effects are really quite good and the film does succeed in giving the viewer a sense of dread and horror (or at least, nervousness). You really sympathize with the characters and hope they make it through this horror.

And that's the biggest problem with ""Cloverfield""; YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY DO OR NOT. Sure, SOME of the main characters HAVE to die. It's inevitable in movies like this, but the MAIN characters fates are unrevealed?

What's going on in Hollywood? Just like ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Cloverfield"" seems to think that an interesting premise, good special effects, excellent acting (only applies to ""No Country""), and heart-stopping action is a good enough excuse to make a movie. Nevermind the fact that we should come up with an ending or have a meanigful or at least sensible plot resolution. Let's just film the thing, release a whole lot of hype and media buzz about it, make a zillion, and then laugh at the viewing public as we take their money and give them an incomplete product.

I, for one, am getting tired of it. I LOVE movies, but I want a little bang for my buck. I'm not saying that all of them should be capable of getting a five-star rating out of me (or any one else), but a least let me have the satisfaction of a movie that tells a good story and has an ending. Give me some closure.

Is that too much to ask, Hollywood?

I guess so.",1209340800,2,2522,4.569844789356985
1588118,3,B00005JPXY,"If you don't want to engage in an intellectual analysis of the 'Cloverfield' viewing experience, STOP HERE.

Everyone has something to say about the ""shaky camera"" style and somewhat unlikeable protagonists that populate this film. Personally, I feel that both of these aspects of the film are distinct and intelligent choices. As such, they don't interest me much.

Are they well executed? Yes. Does everything work flawlessly? No. On the whole, if you shut your brain off - and you can stomach the camerawork -, is the film good? Yes.

Now, I have a different and more fundamental gripe with this movie. It boils down to this. The filmmakers think they're smart... but they're not. This is something of a bold -- and loaded -- statement so herein lies my essential argument:

'The Blair Witch Project' for all of its fault is a near-perfect 'found footage narrative.' From the text at the beginning, we learn that three filmmakers went into the woods to film a project about the Blair Witch. A year later their footage was found. The film then asks the viewer to 'participate' in the movie. We play the role of an individual who 'watches' the Blair Witch footage.

It's not tough, I know -- we're doing it anyway -- but it is a critical aspect of our enjoyment. We're supposed to both actually 'be' and 'play' curious. We buy in that the events could be real... that the film could be a real documentary... and that is what makes the movie scary.

'Cloverfield' is the same sort of movie but it doesn't understand what that requires. It asks us to 'play' the role of a viewer of this found footage but never bothers to explain WHY we're viewing it.

Now, before you get up in my grill, allow me to point out that CONTEXTUALLY, in the movie, we know that dozens of news broadcasts from New York were going out live. Hundreds of people had cameras filming the event.

If we lived in this world -- which the movie asks us to pretend that we do -- we would ask ourselves 'WHY?' before choosing to view this film. Why am I watching this one tape about the monster as opposed to all of the other tapes I could be watching?

Why THIS one?

You see, unlike living in a post-Blair Witch world, a post-Cloverfield Event world is radically unlike our own. Just as with 9-11, which this film heavily references visually and narratively, a new vocabulary and a new world view would have rapidly been established by the survivors.

Facts would be known. We would shorthand certain things.

Just as with a new 9-11 doc or a new JFK doc or a new moon landing doc, a post-Cloverfield event viewer would compare and contrast THIS footage with every other 'Cloverfield' video that existed. For us to actually want to watch it, this footage would need to justify itself with a new spin or a new angle to compete in the marketplace.

This film doesn't. In fact, it doesn't even try. Worse, I'm pretty sure they never even realized that, yeah, maybe they ought to try.

So, in conclusion --

These guys think they're smart -- which is always worse than knowing you're dumb.",1209254400,,3053,4.565934065934066
1588119,5,B00005JPXY,"It's not every director who can shoot an entire film with a hand-held video camera and make it engaging. But, for my money, that is precisely what director Matt Reeves has achieved with ""Cloverfield."" I was admittedly quite torn about catching this in theaters last January. For every five people in my immediate circle who were praising this film to the high heavens, there were at least the same amount more who claimed it was just as bad as ""The Blair Witch Project."" Much like that film, the camera does tend to shake. But, when you're running for your life while still trying to document everything you're witnessing, that pratfall is ultimately unavoidable. It did not, thankfully, detract me from investing my interest. And, unlike ""Blair Witch,"" I actually had a visual threat in the guise of a truly unique and terrifying creature to react to.

That same creature, incidentally, makes its abrupt and unexplained arrival on the very night five young New Yorkers decide to throw a going-away party for one of their own. The first fifteen minutes of the film eases you into these characters, giving you just the right amount of insight into who they are and what they're all about. But, once the head of Lady Liberty comes crashing down the street outside their building, the real thrills begin! This ferocious invader, standing nearly thirty stories high, is certainly a formidable threat in and of itself. But it soon becomes apparent to our protagonists that it is not, by any means, alone. The rampaging monster is host to a multitude of smaller parasitical organisms that drop off from its body and scuttle along the ground like scorpions. One bite from these vicious critters, without giving too much away, would make anybody pray for a bullet.

As a lifelong giant monster fan, I had a blast! Roland Emmerich, who ten years ago helmed the ill-received ""Godzilla,"" could easily learn a thing or two from ""Cloverfield."" It was everything that film could and should have been. In terms of overall mood and atmosphere, I would probably rank this right alongside the Japanese classic, ""Gojira."" I admit it may not be everybody's cup of tea, particulary for those who, like me, utterly despised ""Blair Witch."" But there is still much to savor here.

Among that, predominantly, is the special effects team. Had I not, for whatever theoretical reason, realized this was a fictional movie I was watching, I would have sworn somebody had captured a genuine monster rampage on their video camera. And, amazingly, despite the fact this whole thing takes place in Manhattan, the vast majority of the film was actually lensed on Paramount's back-lot in Los Angeles! Talk about an illusion! This is why I so rabidly savor all those ""behind-the-scenes"" featurettes most others, my own spouse specifically, take for granted. The DVD may not retain the same lasting impact of the theatrical experience, as most of my peers have already outlined. But, for the uninitiated, it does offer some invaluable insight into what exactly made this the box-office hit it quickly became. This review ultimately represents my own opinion.

Modern day New York City: Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) has just gotten the job of his dreams with the exception of his having to move to Japan to fill the position. Rob's Brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) have decided to put on a surprise going away party for him including video testimonials from his guests. Jason is supposed to work the camera but he decides to put the job off on Hud (T.J. Miller), Rob's best friend. The party is jumping when all of a sudden there is a huge explosion in the middle of the city and all hell breaks loose. The party goers scatter leaving only Rob, Jason, Lily, Hud and Marlena together. Rob receives a call from his friend/girlfriend Beth, from across town saying she needs help...

I was expecting a little more out of Cloverfield than was delivered. As stated in the title this felt exactly like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"" meets ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>"". The entire movie is shot with a hand held camera which can be a little nauseating at times.

The Good: The concept of the movie was actually very good. Two ideas that had been done before were combined for a fresh take on each. The acting was decent all around. There are some really well played intense moments in the movie. The special effects were done well. They actually did a decent job of building the characters stories in short order.

The Bad: I think there needed to be a little more interaction with the monster. I know it was shot to look authentic but I think some steady cam shots in the movie may not have been a bad addition and would have been a nice break from the headache inducing hand held.

Overall: ""Cloverfield"" is a decent movie with some good intensity. If you couldn't watch ""Blair Witch Project"" because it made you nauseous doesn't bother with this one. If you can stand the Hand Cam, give ""Cloverfield"" a shot.",1209254400,2,2190,5.2457142857142856

1588215,1,B00005JPXY,"I was advised to state that my comments on Cloverfield amount to a spoiler. So... Warning : spoiler. But I actually question if there is a spoiler to this film. In retrospect of having seen the movie I think that the trailer is completely honest. The only thing hidden in the trailer is the exact shape of the ""entity"" that beheads the statue of liberty. What the heck is ""Cloverfield""? It's simple. ""Cloverfield"" is a terrible movie.

Do not waste your time or money seeing this movie. This is a cheap rip off film which can be best summarized as ""blaire witch"" meets ""godzilla"" with an overdose of post-911 fear thrown in. Why induce 911 references and play off that remaining fear? Because this movie is so lame that it needs cheap references to 911 to get any excitement going what so ever. The only good thing you can say is that it is short - only 80 minutes long. But even at 80 minutes it is way too long - exactly 75 minutes too long. I found myself yawning with boredom. No amount of special effects or jerky camera work can save this snoozer.

But a boring horror/scifi film might just end up being simply bad or average. Not Cloverfield. The thing that raises Cloverfield to the status of terrible movie is that it is so incredibly, completely, and utterly unoriginal. Blaire Witch was not a great film - it was however original and creative - if annoying and slightly nauseating due to jerky camera action. It used low budget techniques to tell a scary story. Like it or not there was creative thought and originality in that film. It made the most of low tech.

In 1954 Ichiro Honda's Gojira, ''' (Godzilla for the US release), was a ground breaking film that inspired an entire genre of films, spoke to the horrors of the atomic age, decried the racist occupation of Japan, and honestly foreshadowed the horrors of the 911 attacks. Filmed on shoe string budget in post war Japan, Gojira in it's original uncut 90 minute release was a remarkable and chilling film. Honda used low tech effects to create moving and terrifying cautionary tale of retribution for the horrors of nuclear war. Though modern audiences now jaded by overwhelming overused special effects may have difficulty connecting with the special effects of 1954, Gojira still stands up, and still sends a chill down the spine. The opening credits set the tone, from a completely black screen bold white characters burst forth with the awesome roar of Gojira and the rumble of giant foot steps. In 2008 that roar and those foot steps assaulting the silence of the theatre still inspire real fear. One can only imagine the effect on audiences of 1954.

What does Cloverfield inspire? Boredom and nausea. Nausea not born of anxiety - but rather motion sickness from jerky camera work. Warning! This movie will make you motion sick! So this is a movie that is completely unoriginal. A movie that shamelessly steals it premise from two well known movies. That's pretty terrible. Add to that the fact that the main characters are undeveloped, unlikable, and incredibly stupid, and you have a stunningly bad movie.

Since I have a personal interest in movies about giant monsters who flatten cities I went to see this movie with the hope of seeing something original. Such a premise offers the possibility of a mystery or a surprise... or some clever twist that would pay tribute to the original - the great Gojira. An homage? I mean it seemed so obvious that there was some unknown monster out there tearing up the city - so obvious that no one in their right mind could simply leave it at that - especially after all the hype. Maybe Gojira would show up. There had to be more right? Right? Wrong. I guess all the remakes - Godzilla vs Rodan, vs, Mothra, vs Monster X, All monsters must Die, Godzilla 2000 - just slipped the minds of the producers - is that it?

No this movie is exactly what it is - there is no surprise. Giant monster attacks New York. Buildings crash into clouds of dust that leave New Yorkers coughing and staggering about the post apocalyptic streets were they get eaten. (Oh yeah - plan on seeing a reference to two other famous horror films - ""Alien"" and ""The Thing"") Sheets of office paper flutter through the sky a la 911 footage. Cloverfield is a completely predictable and entirely derivative film that is driven by a highly choreographed well executed marketing campaign - that's all.

I'm tired of the shaky cam.  In the hands of a good filmmaker, when used in moderation, it can be blended into the flow of the film in such a way that it adds just the needed tension, edge, whatever, into the events on screen.  But when used like this (and Blair Witch, Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum, etc. etc.) it is just a cheap gimmick.  I understand what the filmmaker wanted to do, and I think it was an interesting and ambitious idea, but that doesn't mean it will translate into great film.  If you can't watch the film or, worse, you can't make out what is happening in the film, then it is hard to enjoy the movie.

In addition, the fact that it was filmed in the ""first person"" angle you don't get the moments you would normally expect in a film where the filmmaker is tying everything together, resolving questions, working out the kinks and correcting inconsistencies, you are just left with the bits and pieces that you have available.  This led to only one type of plausible ending and it was far from satisfying for me.

While I'm also griping I'll throw out the type of monsters used in these movies.  How is it that they can be so invincible? Mankind can level cities with ease but we can't seem to hurt a giant bug? And the little monsters the parent spawned were hilarious - though I doubt that was intentional.

Still, I gave the movie a middle-of-the-road score because despite not being that good of a movie it is still fun to watch the first time through and there really aren't that many great monster flicks to choose from.  If you can stomach the shaky cam and suspend your belief for an hour and a half then Cloverfield is still worth the watch.

The film is all about Rob, as one reviewer on here mentioned (Puzzle Box), Rob  could've been taken from the cast of the real world.  We see more of Rob in the film then we do of the huge cool monster that decapitates the statue of liberty.  At the beginning we see Rob with a hot girl, but, oh dear, now at his going away party a month later she shows up with another guy.  They have a little falling out and the hot girl and her guy Travis leave, while Rob's last words are good luck tonight Travis.  Rob's brother, his brother's girlfriend, and his best friend (who holds the camera) try to cheer him up, because even though all these people came to his party he is going to sulk in a corner and then go into his bedroom, this becomes a theme.

All of a sudden Manhattan is attacked by the big cool monster mentioned above, and you guessed it Rob just can't let those be the last words he said to the hot girl.  In a nut shell it goes like this:  Dude, I like have to get to her dude.  Everyone feels so much pity for the little drama going on nobody seems to help anyone around them that could have glass in their grills.  SPOILER ALERT.  Rob's brother dies, he kind of looks upset for a second but quickly focuses on the hot girl again. To console his brothers girl he says at least you didn't say good luck tonight Travis to him.  Oh, there is another hot girl that gets bitten by something, Rob doesn't want to let her finish a soda because he's got to get to this girl he hooked up with once, soon her eyes start bleeding and she has to be killed by the military.  Rob's best friend is upset cause he wanted to hit it but Rob basically tells them, um dudes we gotta go to my girl, so they go and feel sorry for him along the way, not thinking at all about their parents or the big picture.

The best friend delivers corny one liners seconds after family members deaths and right after the hot girl he's trying to have sex with just got half eaten by a thing spawned from the beast.  That's basically it, oh, and the girl he's gotten everyone killed trying to get too (even though there was a single file line out of the city by the military) was with another guy cause he didn't call her for months after they hooked up.

The acting was actually good, but, was about a self absorbed, selfish guy who likes to say dude.  The monster and the mayhem were also cool.  If the movie didn't try to be so serious and went a 50s monster movie throw back with a real feel, then ok.  Or, if you want to make it serious give people that are somewhat likable, which can be done with little or no words, less words would have worked better.

Maybe they were paying tribute to the old monster movies that were typically 70-75 minutes long, but I felt a little cheated by that.

While there was room for improvement, overall, I liked this movie.  One thing I really liked is that it isn't a remake or a sequel (we've had more than enough of those).  It was definitely different and had the feel of an old-style monster movie, but with modern special effects.

I get the whole ""you are there"" handheld camera concept, but it got to be distracting and annoying (it's hard to believe the camcorder shown in the film would've had no image stabilization).  The characters were annoying (especially Hud), and who would be stupid enough to go into a monster-infested city war zone to find his ex-girlfriend?  Then again, those who tag along with said idiot would be considered even more stupid.  And how is it that someone impaled on a rebar can be running around with no problems a few minutes later?

The cons aside, the special effects were great, and once the mind-numbing first 15 minutes were over, the movie was quite enjoyable.  I liked the monster, especially its scream, and the parasites were very nice.  For those who complain ""there was nothing about where the monster came from,"" pay attention to the ship in the harbor in the last scene.

My fear is that we are now going to get 314 more movies done entirely in first-person handheld camera mode, since if there's anything Hollywood knows how to do, it's copy other successful films to death.
Kudos to JJ Abrams for giving us a different kind of movie.  If you can handle the jerky camera movement, it's a worthwhile rental.",1209168000,2,1785,4.643312101910828

Fake websites, fake broadcasts of monster attacks on offshore oil rigs. Just tons and tons of stuff. I would say 85% of the people who watched this movie had no idea about this. It's what made the movie so awesome. The shaky cam isn't nearly as bad as everyone says. How many hours of youtube videos have you watched? So don't complain about a shaky cam. This is the best monster movie out since I watched Godzilla back in the day. Also the most original movie I've seen in FOREVER.

Pros: Viral Marketing to the extreme
  Most original movie to be released in theaters I've seen in years
  The situation is realistic. People die. Get over it.
  The monster is awesome!

Cons: Extras should include the entire marketing campaign of the film.

When I saw Cloverfield in the theater, I was very impressed.  The ""First person cam"" approach to this movie really worked well depicting the disaster scenes -- they are very similar to so many real disaster video clips we all see on TV and the Internet these days.  They add to the realism and horror of the movie.

The DVD extras show just how much hard work and technology went into making this movie.  I am convinced that I can no longer believe anything I see on video.  With enough money, green screen and computer graphics matting, anything can look real.  You'll be surpised at how much of the movie was shot on a sound stage and green screen.

I gave it two stars: One for the really good seldom seen monster (very original) and the other for the video camera battery from hell. There are cars that don't have a battery that lasts that long under constant use. If only they'd shown the brand so we could all buy one!

The video begins with Rob and Beth having a romantic fling and switches to a boring party that lasts at least 5 or 6 hours, showing people we don't want to know, discussing relationships we don't care about, until AT LAST we get to the apparent point of it all -- the invasion. It would have been wonderful if then we could have switched to something we could watch without getting a headache, but no. We stick with the freakin' amature video (which is explained as being viewed by the government in an effort to figure out what happened in New York).  So. What happened in New York?  Well, ""something nasty"" showed up, wreaked the city, spawned off a lot of little vicious buggers, the humans are losing, the lovers are running.........

And then it stops. We never find out what the monster is or where it came from. We don't know who wins, if anyone. IT JUST FREAKIN' STOPS.

Here's a thought for the makers of this loser vid: Sell the monster to a real studio and turn 'em lose. Give them the battery to your video camera while you're at it since you obviously have no use for it.

- A movie without content except the city was attacked by monster and people were running around seeking places to hide
- Main characters are idiot folks

1588424,5,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield tends to be met with mixed reviews, but all in all I thought it was a great movie.  It is essentially the journey of four New Yorkers through a Manhattan that is under attack by a Godzilla-like monster, taken from the perspective of a handheld camcorder that is carried with.  While the actors are far from well known, I feel that it gave the film a genuine feel.  Seeing Brad Pitt running around just doesn't make it feel real, honestly.  Some people were not fans of the camcorder, as it tends to get a little wild during action sequences, but I think its usage made the film truly unique.  It's filmed nearly as live-action--that is, it's like watching your own home video, except with a monster frolicking around.

I definitely recommend this movie.  I will say, though, that it is far better to watch in the theaters or on a big screen TV with surround sound.  If you're watching it for the first time, a 13-inch TV just doesn't draw you in as well.",1208995200,3,966,4.48
1588425,5,B00005JPXY,"Normally I'm not the type of person who enjoys intense films (namely ones intended to scare), but at least in my case I believe Cloverfield was an exceptionally well-done monster movie which both surpassed my expectations and seemed to live up to its hype. The concept of the movie is very entertaining: low-budget camcorders and realistic characters applied to the circumstance of a gigantic spider-like creature having itself a less than casual stroll through NYC. Like many have already said, the way in which the movie was filmed was already used by The Blair Witch Project, but I was glad to see this method used on such a promising premise as Cloverfield has to offer. The shaky camera angles that nauseated a lot of viewers were no trouble for me, and were effective in getting me involved in the intensity and realistic portions of the movie. Unlike the scary movies I've seen and despised in the past, Cloverfield took no cheap shots at my sensitiveness to intense films and thankfully was not full of jump moments or excessively gory. Instead it was oriented around heart-pounding scenes of action and a spontaneous plotline which kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time since I was completely unsure of how the movie would end. As it turned out, the ending was very satisfying in spite of the tragedy of it. I felt very attached to the characters and compelled by the action throughout the film, and when I stepped out of the theater I had a rather unsettling feeling of ""whoa"" (but in a good way). There's really no way to describe it with absolute accuracy for those who haven't seen it, so if you have not yet watched this movie I highly recommend it. It's by far my favorite movie of the year thus far. I went and saw it twice in the theater, and unfortunately the DVD release probably can't compare to the bigscreen atmosphere but it's still great to watch at home. I'd rate this five of five stars, and I don't commonly rate movies that high.",1208995200,3,1965,4.601139601139601

1588427,3,B00005JPXY,"Preparations are under way for a farewell bash for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who, in an undoubted nod to ""Godzilla,"" is leaving for a job in Japan. Before he arrives, Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) records video testimonials from assorted guests, including party babe Lily (Jessica Lucas) and guarded semi-acquaintance Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).

Snippets of conversation reveal Rob has never again contacted Beth (Odette Yustman), the girl from the opening scene, who summarily shows up with another guy -- much to Rob's distress. Just as the emotional steam from this conflict is ready to blow, all hell breaks loose outside and, after viewing the initial devastation from the roof, the hipsters put the party on hold in favor of saving their skins.

This early action, as the group joins the panicking, confused and injured hordes on the dark streets, where the head of the Statue of Liberty has been unceremoniously dumped, is the best stuff in the picture; something dreadful is out there, but neither we nor the characters have a clue what it is until one of the characters exclaims, ""I saw it. It's alive!"" Rob, Lily, Marlena and Hud (T.J. Miller), now manning the camera, head for the Brooklyn Bridge, which the beast upends in spectacular fashion while showing a bit of its lizardly monstrousness in the process.

Rob then insists they head uptown to try to save Beth, presumed to be in the high-rise building from the opening scene; Odysseus had an easy time of it compared to what these unprepossessing non-warrior types go through to reach their destination.

Finding Beth with a piece of rebar sticking through her, they manage to all run to army helicopters to escape but do they?

Very clever plot and script that never overstays its welcome, I think it clocks in at a little over 70 minutes, which feels right for this. I love the lack of back story too, if this really happened, no one would know where it came from as it was unfolding!  And the unknown cast worked well for this movie as well.  The computer generated effects are absolutely stunning, I've never seen better.  And unlike the creatures in The Mist, the monsters here are well thought out and rendered.  Very cool that the monster is rarely shown, but not bogus as you do get several good shots of it.  I did have some problems with it, if I was to get picky.  I'm pretty sure the scale of the monster changes by several hundred feet, depending on what shot it is in. And although the Statue of Liberty head bouncing down the street is neat, I'm pretty sure it is way too small to scale.

1588510,4,B00005JPXY,"From producer J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves' Cloverfield came out of nowhere (literally) to make itself known as a modern day monster movie smash.  Revolving around a group of young people in Manhattan caught in the middle of an attack by an otherworldly beast, Cloverfield is a success thanks to the ingenuity of everyone involved, and even more so because the film was so kept under wrap during production.  The filming technique may make you a little nauseous (though not nearly as bad on the small screen), but it is a decidedly effective way to present an otherwise tried and tired story, and puts some inventive and new spins on the monster movie genre.  It isn't anything spectacular in the least, and the lack of any sort of backstory is a bit of a disappointment, but Cloverfield is incredibly effective for what it is, and in that respect alone, the film is a treat.  There are a nice selection of extras on the DVD for a single disc release, including an insightful documentary on the making of the film, alternate endings, and an entertaining commentary from director Matt Reeves among other extras.",1208995200,4,1106,4.774869109947644

Why the film makers thought it was a innovation to film it with a hand held camcorder(BLAIR WITCH PROJECT) is beyond me.
But, I guess my main objection is one of us isn't ""getting it"".
In the ""monster"" movies of the past, there was a reason. Atomic bomb, bad experiments, etc. etc.. In this movie, there are no why's, from where(?) and how come.
Also, is it a law that only stupid people can be in the modern horror movies. You know, the ones who go back for cat, or piece of jewelery or something insignificent worth risking your life for.
One other final note. The movie is 83 mins.( way to long), but 11 mins are the credits.

1588513,3,B00005JPXY,"Okay, now that you've read all of the reviews about the ""shaky"" camera-work, put all of that aside. Most of the negative reviews posted refer to the cinematic release of ""Cloverfield"" which some folks suffered from motion sickness. Odds are, that is not going to happen to you with this DVD release (unless you own that 100"" Sony plasma TV recently rolled out). I saw ""Cloverfield"" in the theater and had no problem, and watching the DVD last night posed no problem at all for my wife who is prone to motion sickness.

That aside, I have to say, ""Cloverfield"" is a fun, and very clever movie. I'm not going to run down the basic storyline as I'm not into spoiling any aspect of the film (feel free to browse through the mulitude of reviews that spell out exactly how the film unfolds if you wish). Besides, by now you most likely know the basics of the movie.
Sure it's a monster movie, a very cool monster movie, told in a unique way. You actually get to root for some of the characters which is odd, considering most of the time in horror films is spent rooting for the monster.

The one aspect I loved about ""Cloverfield"" is that the creature is not ""misunderstood"", or ""a harmless animal who is frightened and doing what it would naturally"". NO the Big-McLarge-Huge monster in ""Cloverfield"" is mean, and sinister. This beast is out to hurt, maim, destroy and eat anything in it's path without mercy. It's big and it's ticked off at us for some reason. Sure there may be little to no backstory on the beast.....GREAT. I don't want to know how, why, or from where this thing decided to attack.

But, of course, DVD viewers get what the theater-goers missed out on, all the obligatory making-of DVD extras that help us understand what we're actually looking at.  Most of the extras weren't that great, but the featurette on the special effects was pretty illuminating -- after watching it I did gain a lot of respect for the technical end of the filmmaking -- how they matched up the CGI to the jerky, mile-a-minute camcorder footage.  Pretty impressive.

This is an okay monster movie: having turned a profit, hopefully JJ Abrams & Co will be able to crank out a sequel where the big bad makes it out of Manhattan and we can see (and learn) more about what makes this bug tick.

In fact, I felt that one of the film's strengths was an excellent sense of timing throughout.  There was just enough footage of the party to give you a basic idea of the relationships between the main characters, and then the action began, driving all of them to the rooftop and from there to the streets.  I put the DVD in just to watch a few minutes before grabbing dinner, and ended up watching it all the way through, and I felt it was tight, edited well, and the pacing was just right.

I also reject the notion that the hand-held camera was too obtrusive or too shaky.  I thought it leant a sense of realism to the movie and I didn't find it to be distracting or even all that noticeable after you watch for a few minutes.

I loved the big action sequences and didn't feel they were overly violent or bloody. The smaller monsters who drop off the big guy were creepy and in a lot ways more scary than the main one.

The unknown or little-known actors did a very good job and unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find them annoying or unlikeable.

The movie is supposed to be a monster attack that is seen through the eyes of people who are there, and that is what you get. It is nothing more or nothing less, but it is still fun. When is the last time you have seen Godzilla up close and personal? Never.

That is not to attack the Godzilla series, because they are awesome movies, but this breathes life into a genre that has pretty much been by the book every film. This offers something different.

1588575,3,B00005JPXY,"Watching this movie on DVD helped a bit with the shaking camera syndrome.  I also had to put the English subtitled on so there is something fixed that I can focus on.
The plot, I get it.  Something attacked New York City, and someone caught it on the camera.  Take the event like a volcano eruption, not much warning (sometimes) then BOOM!  You are later lucky to catch a glimpse of the eruption and a little of the ending.
The camera work is the biggest problem in the movie.  I understand they wanted to make it look like a documentary, but you also have to make it watchable.  If you are trying to make it an ""art"" like many of these reviewers are saying, then make the ""art"" watchable.  So, we the viewing public can appreciate your ""art"".
The Monster worked, and I think the design was pretty good.  The special effects team and the CGI team did a great job (Lucas could use some lessons from these guys) on the destruction of a city.  All the explosions, the army fights, the smokes, the monsters looked great.  The movie got 3 stars from me because of the special effects.
The acting was almost bad.  WOW, was that camera guy annoying, ""jesus dude, did you see that?""  ""God, what was that?""  ""There's some scary s**t up there""... over and over again.  Again, I know... it was shot like a documentary, but still, we have to watch this.  Just a little better thoughts into the script would have been nice.

1588576,1,B00005JPXY,"I can't believe I wasted money purchasing this DVD. The best thing about this movie is that it mercifully ended after 87 painful minutes. (Well, there wasn't ""really"" an ending but at least it stopped.) Normally you'd question why a movie was so short at only 87 minutes, but with this movie, that was 88 minutes too long. Now I know why the tv trailers were so secretive and didn't really show anything about this movie.

The whole movie is filmed as if shot through a home-handheld videocamera. I can't properly express how ANNOYING that was. The non stop ""massive"" camera shake and out of focus shots only make me wish I could get my money back on this piece of garbage. Not only did it ruin the movie, but it just makes you want to launch your refrigerator through your tv. Here's a tip for the producers of this movie - In life and death situations where you're climbing buildings and fighting monsters, the last thing you would do is think to grab the camera and continue filming. What an insult!

The only good part in the movie was when the guy that kept filming with the handheld camera and was screaming ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"", ""Rob"" finally got killed. (Basically the above dialog sums up this entire movie.)

I would have given this movie a negative number for the review, but that's not possible. The plot 'could' have been ok, but the movie didn't follow through on the plot. There's an unknown monster that attacks the city, and oh, by the way, the movie ISN'T EVEN ABOUT THAT! None of your questions were answered, everybody apparently (?) dies, you don't know what happened to the monster or the dozens of 'spawned offspring' it created and the filming just stops leaving you feeling completely cheated.

1588577,4,B00005JPXY,"SPOILERS!

I was expecting a rampaging-monster flick where the creature eventually dies from something really simple, like water, or the bad taste of humans in its mouth.

However, Cloverfield (where did that name originate, by the way?) has much more than a rampage going on.  There's a run for dear life, the willingness to go back for a beloved woman even though she might have been dead already, the grief for a fallen brother and a friend, and a relationship that endures to the bitter end.

I was quite impressed by the way the special effects team made it look as if all of Manhattan was being destroyed; so much destruction on such a massive scale could not have been easy to simulate, even with green screen tech.  And that monster---it was much worse than the one in the far less superior movie The Mist.  Kudos to the monster designer as well.  The image of the camera operator being eaten was quite stunning.

I have no problems with the handheld camera; it really didn't bother me on the small screen, though it might have on a larger one.  The movie does leave one with several unresolved issues to ponder, though:  Where did this monster come from?  Did someone create it in a lab or send it here from another planet?  Why didn't the military nuke the city to make sure it was gone for good?  Why did the bombs they dropped on it have no discernible effect?  What were those smaller creatures that emanated from its body?  Were the filmmakers making an allegory about terrorist attacks or random violence and evil that strikes the most innocent and unsuspecting people?

Good for an hour or so of action and terror.",1208822400,4,1630,4.588235294117647
1588667,4,B00005JPXY,"One time, a movie is announced to be in development which sends fans and moviegoers into a frenzy and hype and constant discussion keep going to the point of its release date. But then, in a sudden realization of ""oh yeah, this was a movie, right?"", people realize a good premise and a neat idea might not make a good film. That film was ""Snakes on a Plane"" where just the story sounded more fun than what the film did with it and in a way, Cloverfield suffered the same fate. First appearing as an enigmatic teaser trailer before ""Transformers"", many people were abuzz about this new film, shot in a unique style with a very familiar genre. But is this a good film, or just a good idea stretched too long?

Rob Hawkins is going away to take on a very impressive job in Japan and his brother, Jason along with girlfriend Lily plan a surprise going-away party for him one night. Documenting the night is ""Hud"", who's kind of a goofball and who also has eyes for Marlena, who doesn't even know Rob but came along anyway. But the celebration's cut short when earthquakes happen, explosions occur in the distance and a roaring sound is heard from down the street.

I always like watching these bigger-than-life movies but there was always something ""filmy"" about it and the great directors like Spielberg and Cameron know how to let the direction tell the story while still maintaining that sense of tension and excitement. Yet, with a movie, entirely shot to make it look like it was on a handheld will have some issues with people. Why does everything look so staged, as if certain glimpses of the monster are just fleeting enough and most people wouldn't shoot the way he does. But it's also fun to see a monster movie in a very compacted style and it helps bring out the reality even when you know they had to break out the computers for most of this stuff. While I personally never got sick of all the handheld moving every which way, some are going to find it distracting the camera never seems to wanna sit still.

Despite that, the film is actually quite exciting and when things get loud and frantic, there's actually quite a lot of suspense and pulse-pounding stuff that goes on and even though it's not completely showing you all you'd like to say, it's quite a blast to watch actually. And forgive the fact that a store-bought video camera will produce a theatre-ready sound experience too since it's nitpicking; although to be fair, there's a lot of weird plot things you can balk at. With quite a few memorable images and sequences, it probably won't make sense all the way through but at least it's fun anyway.

However as a film, it doesn't entertain quite so much since the good rule of thumb for a horror movie is have likable, relatable characters first and then throw them in the fire and even after some scenes at a party, we still don't get a full sense of the characters. While we're not going to exactly have characters all of a sudden monologue after being attacked by a 350-foot creature and there's even some moments for the actors to get a bit emotional, it doesn't really feel enough either.

Let's face it: the big release this week is this movie so I bet most people are going to watch this anyway. Whether or not you like it is something else but I enjoyed it.",1208822400,,3288,4.500837520938023

I'll tell you what was going on; as you kept your eyes fixed to the screen, the producers emptied your pockets of cash.
  I know there is some ""mythology"" and a whole underground thing to Cloverfield, but fact is this- if ANYONE were to spend their time filming throughout an event such as those that took place in Cloverfield, then they would AT LEAST KEEP THE CAMERA STILL FOR ONE MINUTE!

1588674,2,B00005JPXY,"I'm a sucker for any kind of monster movie, and this one looked from the trailers to be fairly nasty. So even when the reviews came in that this was a feature-length gimmick in nauseating handheld with too little monster and too many yuppies--offset by some other reviews that said it was truly scary and that it's all a satire on precisely HOW moronic our single-minded consumer yuppies are today--I had to go see it for myself.

This movie takes the Blair Witch Project idea [which, before that, was the Cannibal Holocaust idea] that what we're seeing is a videotape in the remains of some horrible catastrophe. Yes, the entire movie is in shaky, hand-cam video. We open in this fabulous loft in the Time Warner center. This is the apartment of Beth's dad, which she has just used to sleep with the vacuous Rob. It is he manning the camera, and he wakes Beth up with it and suggests they spend the day at Coney Island, which she has never been to. Then suddenly we're at this party a few months later--the earlier footage was stuff that was taped over for what we're seeing here. It's a fairly clever way to work flashbacks into the story with the stricture that we only see what the video sees. We are now at Rob's going-away party, as he is shipping off for a job in Japan. Rob's brother is taking the video, but soon recruits the blabbermouth moron Hud to assume duties, going around the party and taping video testimonials to what a sweet dude Rob is, Bro. Also on hand are Rob's brother's girlfriend Lily, and a woman Marlene, who clearly wants Hud to leave her alone so she can devote her full attention to her cell phone.

So Beth shows up at the party with a date, and Rob, who has not seen or even called her since they slept together, that once, is angry and at one point implies that she's a slut for having a date, months later, with a guy who presumably calls her and is not moving to Japan. Okay, so Rob is a total tool. He gets worse. And ladies and gentlemen, this is your main character.

Hud tapes Rob and Beth having a private conversation [tool!], then goes inside and spreads the news that they slept together to everyone [tool!]. There's a shot of Rob giving a speech that is interrupted by some other people taping it on their phones and such, and you wonder if this is a comment on our cameras-everywhere documentary society, and perhaps the people who seem only to be able to experience life through the interface of an electronic device. And of course, here we are in the audience, voyeurs watching their experience. Woah: indicted, dude. Totally, bro!

So all of a sudden the lights go out and everyone runs up to the roof, where they see a huge explosion downtown. Then they all run down to the street, where the head of the Statue of Liberty lands nearby, followed by a stream of smoke that it an exact replica of certain 9/11 footage. Our heroes are all like, totally freaked, and end up trying to get across the Brooklyn Bridge to escape. While on it, Rob gets a cell phone call from Beth, alone in her dad's apartment at 59th street, and tries to talk to her as the bridge collapses and his brother is killed. They then run back to Lower Manhattan. Across from them, people are looting an electronics store, and Rob wanders in, looking for a battery for his phone so he can call Beth back, while ignoring the extreme danger and his friends' entreaties and the reality that his brother just died. He finds a battery, attempts to call, then decides that he must make his way up to rescue Beth, that girl he slept with once.

Okay, so are we to understand that Rob is psychotic? He barely knows this woman, seems barely phased by the fact that his brother just died, is ignoring imminent peril, and is about to set off on an idiotic quest to rescue someone who will surely be dead by the time he arrives. I'm still not sure if we're supposed to find this all terribly brave and romantic, because all the signs point to Rob having lost his mind. So then what are we to think when his friends decide to go with him? That they've all lost their minds as well? That they are all such little vacuums who picked up their sense of human values from watching Braveheart reruns on TBS and beer commercials? These questions hang over the rest of the movie and further alienate you from the characters, none of which were that appealing anyway.

SPOILERS > > >
So they pop down the subway at Spring Street and pop up, ten minutes later, at 59th [approximately four miles], having been attacked by the little mini-monsters the big monster brought along for company. Beth's apartment tower has collapsed, and is leaning against another building so, nutcases that they are, they decide to scale the upright building and transfer to the semi-collapsed one--rather than attend to saving their own lives--in an effort to rescue a person whom no one has heard from for hours and is in all probability dead. They scale 57 flights while barely becoming winded [all those Pilates courses really WILL pay off in case of apocalypse!], rescue the woman who, although lying IMPALED for several hours, has not lost enough blood to prevent her from running down the street at full speed just a few minutes later. Talk about urban warriors!
< < < SPOILERS END

Did I enjoy it? Only marginally. There was just too much of the yuppies and not enough of the monster [although the monster does seem to shadow our heroes with uncanny accuracy]. At times the monster is right over there and idiot Hud has the camera trained at his moron friends as they blab and fret. There were some good scares and the monster is freaky, but it's not really showing what you want to see. Oh, and by the way, the screenplay is made up almost entirely of ""Oh my God!,"" ""Rob!,"" and ""We gotta get out of here!""

The conceit of showing the videotape supposedly shot at the scene is not only a way to save money overall, it is a way to deny a directorial presence, to deny that the movie is constructed at all, and while this works to a degree to provide the viewer with a heightened sense of immediacy and feeling that anything can happen, it also reduces the substance of the movie, and lends to the feeling that it's just a gimmick. It also, because there is no ostensible beginning, middle or end [and what there is could only detract from the overall conceit], leaving one with a feeling of, you know, having just watched a bunch of footage. Interesting, maybe, but without the overall shape and depth of a real movie and the resonance it may or may not leave you with.

But the real problem is those insipid characters, and the problem, very distancing to me as an audience member, as to whether they've all had psychotic breaks or they're just phenomenally stupid. Hey, I've seen the movie and I still don't know, so if this is all some brilliant satire I'm not picking up on the clues that tell us that. If not, well, I'm sorry if the filmmakers think that these are intriguing or admirable characters. Matters do not end well for many of the characters involved, and it's hard not to realize that if Rob hadn't been such a dunderheaded sentimental narcissist, and if his friends had a little more spark in their synapses, many more of them would have survived to the end of the movie.

1588728,5,B00005JPXY,"I grew up on Godzilla movies of the 60s and 70s and I have always enjoyed movies like this. I was also someone who followed Cloverfield's viral marketing campaign being caught up in the excitement which the first teaser trailer delivered. Although I have a few complaints about a couple aspects of the movie; for me the movie more than lived up to the hype and JJ Abrams and Matt Reeves delivered a movie that was a terrifying thrill ride.

I understand that the way the movie was filmed was a deal breaker for some people. For me there were times when I did think the shakiness was a bit too much but for the majority of the film the camera technique faded into the background and I was able to enjoy the movie. Being a lover of giant creature features the other slight disappointment was in the length of time the monster was seen in the movie. I say it's a slight disappointment because I do think that seeing only glimpses of the monster throughout the movie did help create that sense of fear of the unknown and the suspense of what may happen at any minute. But I don't think showing the monster a little more than they did would not have hurt. Also a consolation is the fact that creature designer Neville Paige designed a giant monster that was frightening, very original and innovative.

Much has been said about the plot so I will not rehash it here. I did like the acting and the time in the beginning of the movie getting to know our characters was well spent. For me they were characters which I grew to care about. TJ Miller's character of Hud and his unrequited crush on Marlena provides for some humorous moments of comic relief throughout the film. But the main relationship driving the plot of the movie is Rob who finds the courage to face a monster head on in his pursuit to rescue Beth the girl he's afraid to commit to.

1588732,3,B00005JPXY,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!

The visual effects in this movie were very good, and once the action gets going, it never ends.  What this movie REALLY lacks is one original idea.

A group of young adults are video taping a very scary event.  Blair Witch rip off!
A monster destroys New York City.  King Kong rip off!
The monster has alien tick like beings which lay eggs in humans and rip their stomaches out from the inside.  Alien rip off!
The Statue Of Liberty's head is flying down the street.  The Producer admits he ripped this off from an Escape From New York poster.
The Producer takes the ""Cloverfield"" exit on his way to work everyday.  He couldn't even come up with the name on his own.

I especially liked the scene where the guy's cell phone battery dies, and they go to an electronic store to get a new one off the shelf.  ""Hey genius... That one's not charged either!""

In the theater, I frequently found myself saying ""take the Lincoln Tunnel, take the Tunnel out, and run to Pennsylvania!""

Gee, it sure seems like it didn't take that much time to mobilize a Military command force on Manhattan Island complete with tanks, troops in full body armor, and full aerial support on a weekend.

The Military scene leader just let's them go, and tells them when the last helo out will be?  I don't think so.

This movie runs for about an hour and a half.  Most camcorder tapes are only 60 minutes.  The movie should've been a LOT shorter.

On that note, the Human Race tends to be survivalistic.  In a crisis situation such as the events in this movie, I really doubt very many people would maintain the presence of mind to video tape the whole thing when their personal safety is at risk, especially the moron who was doing all the taping.  Example:  A big monster is about to eat you... Do you zoom in and adjust your focus, or do you throw the camera at the monster and run for your life?  I'd pick option B.

While we're on topic, why is it always New York City that gets destroyed in all the movies.  Why can't aliens destroy Dallas?  Now I'd pay to watch Dallas/Ft. Worth destroyed.  We've destroyed NYC in earthquakes, military attacks, aliens have destroyed it with an alien super weapon, monsters of all types have had their way with the island, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, and Howard Stern have all reduced the city to cinders, and New Jersey seems to come out unscathed EVERY TIME.  We've seen this city destroyed so many times, that when it really was attacked, it just seemed like something else on TV during a 24 hour news cycle.

This movie had good acting and great production values.  I just thought it was very obvious that most elements of the film were ripped off from other films, and at times, it was difficult to watch because the camera was too shaky, and it randomly would skip over to what the event was taped over.  Cute idea, but I found it far too distracting for this type of movie.  That said... The action does tend to suck you in, and the visual effects and sound were well produced.  All in all, this would be a great rental.  I wouldn't feel my DVD collection was incomplete without this title.",1208476800,,3142,4.46572934973638

1588734,5,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield was the first media sensation of 2008 and an excellent case study in canny marketing. A teaser trailer appeared in theaters months ahead and featured a few, brief, tantalizing scenes of chaos in Manhattan with no mention of a title or who was in it. The only thing that was certain was that J.J. Abrams was somehow involved. Fans speculated about possible similarities to his TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;or the possibility that he had masterminded a new kind of monster movie. This teaser trailer sparked intense interest on the Internet which the studio brilliantly exploited with snippets of information staggered over succeeding weeks. The marketing paid off and the buzz resulted in a strong opening weekend and decent critical reaction.

There is an audio commentary by director Matt Reeves. He starts off talking about the genesis of the project and how he got the gig. Reeves says that he resisted the urge to have a lot of obvious edits in favour of long takes or invisible edits in order to mimic a film actually shot by an average person who was there. To that end, he points out that the style of the film was meant to suggest that anyone could have shot it. This is an engaging and informative track with very few lulls.

""Document 01.18.08: The Making of Cloverfield"" takes a look at how the film came together amid a shroud of secrecy. The use of hand-held cameras is examined and how it gave the film an authenticity. The on-the-set footage shows how it was filmed, mostly on a soundstage which is amazing because it doesn't look it in the film. We see several scenes being shot and it is fascinating to see how they pulled it off.

""Cloverfield Visual Effects"" examines how they virtually destroyed Manhattan with CGI effects. The fore and middle ground of scenes were real with practical sets while the background was a mix of CGI and good ol' Matte paintings. This featurette takes us through the major SFX set pieces and shows us how they did them.

""I saw it! It's alive! It's huge!"" J.J. Abrams was inspired by Godzilla and its iconic status in Japan and he wanted to do that for America. This featurette takes a look at how the creature was designed and why it looks the way it does.

""Clover Fun"" are outtakes and bloopers as the cast blow their lines and goof around.

Also included are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reeves. There is more footage from Rob's farewell party and more of him and his friends in the subway tunnels including more from the aftermath of the attack there.

There are two alternate endings with optional commentary by Reeves. Both are pretty minor tweaks that did not seem all that different.",1208476800,5,2840,4.99154334038055

It was a blast, the creature is pretty frightening and the parasites are disgusting.  J.J. Adams is a mastermind weaving intricate webs of secrets and playing with our imagination.  This film is beautiful and rich with shocking moments that are truly terrifying.  It's starts off confusing then it picks up the pace and never really slows down.  I have to warn people who will watch this with their kids especially little kids it will make them pee their pants.

1588815,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield"" is a J.J. Abrams-produced monster flick shot in ""The Blair Witch"" fashion. And I am not just talking about its shaky hand-held camera; its elaborate marketing tactics also reminds me of the 1999 maga-hit horror movie that turned out not so scary after all. I wouldn't be surprised if there is talk of making a sequel to ""Cloverfield.""

The difference is, I think, ""Cloverfield,"" in which something huge and ferocious attacks Manhattan, is really scary when it wants to. The film has several nice shots of the monster and its attack with top-notch visual and sound effects. The process of the total destruction of the city is seen from the viewpoint of ordinary people, and some of the shots including the clouds of dust in the street after buildings collapse are realistic, obvious references to 9/11, but frankly I really don't know these references are necessary.

Interestingly, the film's digital camera approach, which is intended to create realism, often makes its images look more artificial. Characters are supposed to be running, but a guy named ""Hud,"" obviously not a professional cameraman, manages to get great shots. He never misses a chance to shoot wherever he is, and he is very good at it, not a shot out of focus. And these people including Hud never really try to leave the city under siege.

But I maybe I shouldn't complain. The story of ""Cloverfield"" is only borrowing many elements from other numerous B-monster films, where a small group of main characters must do something heroic when the crowd is running for their lives, and the military is brave but always useless, and so on, the formula Spielberg did in ""War of the World"" (with the 9/11 references again). Without its digital camera and seasickness, ""Cloverfield"" is just a standard monster film with some nice visual effects.",1207785600,2,1821,4.944444444444445

1588867,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield: The Monster from the Internet

It's been over a week since I took my wife and kids to see Cloverfield at the local cineplex. My wife, who is generally hard to please, liked it. But, she thought the shaky hand held camera work detracted from the overall experience. Both my pre teen children loved it. They seemed generally terrified at all the right parts and ate their popcorn in a most hypnotic manner. My reaction was only slightly more nuanced. I liked the movie, but I just felt like there was too much missing.
My biggest complaint is the camerawork. All the jerky movements and blurred shots got old after the first five minutes. I was bored to tears watching poorly shot asphalt and off kilter shots of running feet. Let's face it, it's a gimmick. The subpar cinematography does not enhance the theatre going experience.
The plot of Cloverfield (or what passes for a plot) revolves around an extremely attractive group of twenty-somethings who brave impossible odds to rescue the male lead's ex-girlfriend. In a major suspension of belief, they head towards the center of the city as a gigantic mutant ravages New York, eating people and knocking down skyscrapers.
This brings me to my next point. Cloverfield's script borders on incoherence because it explains nothing. And, believe it or not, this is what fascinates me the most about this movie.
The main plot points and explanations do not exist in the movie. They exist on the internet.
The producers of Cloverfield have set up a series of internet sites that provide the answers to most of the questions posed in the film. Now these sites all fit into the mythos that the makers of Cloverfield have created. The sites include on line comic books, fake Japanese corporations, soft drink ads and more.  If you visit all these sites and take in all the content provided therein the movie will suddenly come into focus. This is ironic considering how out of focus the actual movie is.
The producers of Cloverfield have taken the ""Blair Witch"" concept and taken it up a notch.
This is not a film release in the classical sense...this is a true multi media event taking full advantage of the internet. Maybe that's why it is hard for me to like this film. It takes personal time and investment to truly appreciate it. You can't just sit in the theatre and watch the movie, not if you want to understand what's going on. You have to research it. You have to invest time and effort outside of the movie going experience.
It has become clear just how conflicted I am regarding this movie. After visiting the connected internet sites I now understand the movie and what it's about. So I'm enjoying the movie more after the fact. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not that's a good thing.
So in the end I will give Cloverfield 4 stars out of five. The film deserves that rating if nothing else for the sheer innovation of its packaging.",1207785600,3,2913,4.654368932038835
1588868,5,B00005JPXY,"This film is absolutely brilliant. The fast paced movement of this film and the pure sense of claustrophobia it creates amazes me. There are so many good things to say about this that I don't know where to begin. I can only mention a few because my review would take too long.  I really feel that ""Cloverfield"" is destined to become a classic giant monster movie. Up there with the ranks of ""Godzilla"", and ""The Host"". I was on the edge of my seat the whole time due to the non-stop action and pure tension. The special effects are outstanding and the editing is fantastic. People have complained about the movement of the camera creating a nauseating feeling.  I say .. Cool. That is what ""Cloverfield"" is about. It's about 4 people who happen to have a camera looking for a way to get out of harms way. Yes, at times it's nauseating to watch because of the movement but that only adds to what the film is. Trust me, this movie is Awesome. Believe all the good reviews that it has received. I only hope that this can be the start of a ""New wave"" of horror films featuring giant monsters. ""The Host"" Kicked butt and ""Cloverfield"" rocked.  Let's do away with the current wave of sadistic torture horror movies and replace it with Kaigu - Giant monsters.

1588869,1,B00005JPXY,"One of the biggest issues for me was obviously...the camerawork. I get it, OK?  I get that it's supposed to be some real live amateur filming of the attack, but it could have been a little more polished.  I got dizzy a few times.  It reminded me of all those YouTube videos where people are recording concerts while jumping up and down. Also, I've seen Blair Witch (you know it'll get compared to it), so this type of filming isn't foreign to me, but in Cloverfield, it was extra distracting.  And my goodness, that camera was stronger than Jack Bauer's cell phone--and we know that battery has yet to really die.

Aside from the technical stuff, it was just a boring movie with bad acting. I can appreciate a good viral campaign like every other business major, but at least have something to back it up. You know it's bad when you have no clue what the monster is, but you're just praying that it stomps all the main characters. Bad acting (what's the going rate for an actor that can say ""Oh my G-d!"" over and over?) accompanied by a lame script (does a movie like this really require the guy/girl drama?).

Cloverfield is simply a weak movie. I don't mind a movie where you have a monster or some crazy happenings and you can't quite figure out why (The Birds is classic, heck so is Tremors for that matter), but Cloverfield just missed so many marks.

It'll be on Starz eventually, so just hold off and save your money.",1207612800,7,1424,4.432950191570881
1588870,4,B00005JPXY,"The basic ""plot"" of CLOVERFIELD is this. A group of twenty-something hip New Yorkers are having a going away party for one of their friends, Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who has received a big promotion at the company he works for and is moving to Japan. The party is going along relatively smoothly until Rob has a brief confrontation with his ex-girlfriend. Shortly after there is a massive explosion and the power goes out. No one knows what is happening and the party moves outside. The frivolity comes to an end when there's another explosion and the head of the Statue of Liberty falls from the sky and careens down the street. Mass hysteria ensues and chaos runs rampant. The core group of friends and a couple of tagalongs attempt to evacuate the city with thousands of other people until the bridge they are crossing is attacked by a giant creature that is just barely glimpsed on screen. The remaining friends want to evacuate, but Rob refuses to leave the city until he can make sure his ex-girlfriend has left her apartment. What follows is a quick and jerky romp through the tunnel system of the city, being chased by fleshing-eating miniature monsters, getting caught in the crossfire between the military and the monster, and just trying to stay alive. The tape being used to cover the event is interlaced with a few scenes here and there of Rob and his girlfriend from just weeks before when they were still a very happy couple.

CLOVERFIELD has been described as a cross between a Godzilla movie and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Though that description isn't completely accurate, it does give a decent assessment of what the movie is like. The monster is never really seen until the end of the movie, but it does a huge amount of damage. The film is extremely shaky and when I first saw the movie several people were overheard complaining about the headache they had. Despite this, I really enjoyed the movie. It was something different and somewhat original and it makes me want to see more. It would be great if the studio did a follow up of the picture or published a book or something explaining where the monster came from and telling the story in a more linear, narrative fashion than the personal-point of view that CLOVERFIELD is. Most people either enjoy the movie or find it a complete waste of time; there are very few people who fall in the middle. If you don't mind shaky camera footage and are looking for a different kind of movie that tells an old-story, but from a newer perspective, give CLOVERFIELD a try. Also, in all honesty the DVD is probably the best way to watch the movie. Not only does it include the film, it's loaded with extras.",1207526400,,2668,4.628691983122363

To make things worse, Matt Reeves took what could have a wonderful creature movie and turned it into a rollercoaster ride of nauseated dizzyness. Now, there's talk of a sequel filmed with a different point of view? Matt Reeves is making a mockery of the Movie Industry in Hollywood.

1588946,4,B00005JPXY,"I had a chance to see this at the cinema and cannot wait for the DVD release. For my money this is an owner not a renter. Now here's the scoop. This movie received a fair amount of press so my plot description will be brief. The film follows a group of twenty somethings when the party they are attending is cut short by a monster ravaging New York City. The entire episode is caught on digicam as a number  of the group set out to see if they can rescue the one guy's girlfriend.
  Most of what people talk about is the jitteriness of the hand-held camera. No question about it, it will help divide the audience. I must say I was mildly annoyed at times, but I can't help but think it might not have been as good were more traditional camera techniques used. You feel like you are there. It DOES evoke many of the same emotions people experienced when they saw the ground-level footage immediately after the 9-11 attacks. When I was young and saw all those wonderfully cheezy Japanese monster movies at the theatre, the camera was always set high so you could see the monster and a lot of buildings. Here you are on the ground and the destruction is raining down around you. It's an eerie feeling.
  There are other nice touches here as well. What are those smaller creatures dropping from the monster. You're not sure until they appear close up out of the dark and attack like rats. The one character gets bit and you're not sure what the outcome will be, and neither do they until they walk into a military/medical safe-zone where a med-tech sees the girl's been bitten and knows exactly what will happen. I thought this was a clever and deft touch. It widens the scope of the events.
  I also liked the way the monster is slowly revealed. The producers figured there was no need to hang on the image. A great argument for less is more. I loved the special effects as well. To me they weren't gratuitous. They did the job they were intended to do. The shots of the crumbling city evoked a tremendous amount of emotion in me. It all seemed so real. Once again, I felt I wasn't looking at a movie as much as I was experiencing something first hand.
  I'm of the school of criticism where movies should be rated within the context of what they are. Yes, this ultimately is a monster movie. These types of movies grab little attention in high circles, but if there were a ""Best Monster Movie"" category in the Academy Awards, this would walk away with a great number of Oscars. For what it is, there are few better.",1207180800,3,2513,4.375536480686695
1588947,4,B00005JPXY,"I always wondered what would happen if you place a giant monster in the streets of NYC - other than complete and utter chaos. This movie is very clever. It's godzilla meets blair witch.

The intro is kind of boring because the movie takes too long introducing the characters. Once you get past that, it's a rollercoaster ride (with motion sickness).",1207180800,,349,4.721311475409836
1588948,5,B00005JPXY,"The thought of telling an oft told story in a different way is very hard to visualize or think of when there are so many fine examples that precede it. However, this movie does succeed in many different ways. The unfolding of the story is where it exceeds most.
The story begins and is carried out almost entirely by a hand held camera. I have to admit, I was ready to exit the theater close to the beginning when the first sensations of something wrong occurred. I was glued after that. What I liked was that the giant beast that destroys New York story was told from behind a camera. What I didn't like was the same thing.
I wish there were more and longer moments when the camera movement wasn't there. Only one scene, when the main characters encounter the beast in central park, where the shot is from a short distance and not from the hand held. It didn't last long, alas.
However, I do highly recommend anyone who enjoys monster movies to see this one. It is well worth your time. It's kinda like Godzilla meets the Blair Witch!",1207180800,,1035,4.395833333333333
1588949,4,B00005JPXY,"I have to say I really enjoyed Cloverfield. Going into the film I had a big concern that you wouldn't get to see what brought such disaster to NYC. Thankfully you did get to see a decent amount of the creature by time the film ended. And you have to love that you weren't watching something that looked like godzilla. Instead of a laughable giant toy you get a really strange looking beast that tears apart anything in its' path.

The story follows a guy who will be leaving for Japan and some of his freinds. They throw him a good luck suprise party when you get a little background on the characters up until the lights going out with a loud noise to follow. As they run out into the chaotic city streets they see the Statue of Liberty's come crashing down while catching a quick glimpse of the giant creature in between a couple skyskrapers. As the story continues you follow four of the characters as they do anything they can to survive and save a fellow friend trapped in their destroyed building.

Overall I say this one deserves 4 stars. I thought for a low budget film they did a tremendous job making it seem as if NYC was in ruins. All the creature action was exciting, very well done and truley terrifying at times. Just the thought of that situation actually happening will give you some chills. Despite the complaints regarding the camera it really isn't that bad. After 10 mins you get completely used to it and should enjoy the show.",1206921600,5,1449,4.443609022556391

1588952,4,B00005JPXY,"I was really blown away by this film. The concept of a hand-held camera filming the whole thing was well concieved and well executed. It really made the film come across on a more personal level, yet it wasn't excessive.

The creatures were truly terrifying and realistic. I hope that the Academy will recognize this with some sort of SFX award come Oscar season.

The acting was what really impressed me, though. Unlike normal movies where the cast pretends the camera isn't there, these actors recognized the camera, and came across as real people in that situation. Very impressive ensemble.

I know a lot of people hated it, particularly the way it ended. At the risk of sounding very corny; I found that one way to appreciate it more is to look at it as a sort of love story. If you think of the main plot line as the Rob/Beth relationship, with the monster attack supporting it, it really is a very good movie.

Every character in Cloverfield represents someone YOU know...The hero who won't let the love of his life die alone, the best friend who copes by cracking jokes, the girl who is paralyzed with fear and her friend who doesn't want to be left alone (and ends up surviving)... Each of these characters do EXACTLY what REAL people would do when the most horrifying disaster we've ever seen starts to unfold.... Why does everything have to be explained to you people??? Oh, that's why, because you don't understand anything that isn't spelled out for you and force-fed down your throats... Everything is there on film even the hope filled ending...

1589014,3,B00005JPXY,"The idea, conceived by producer J.J. Abrams, is brilliant, and the story told here is exciting, riveting stuff. It's tense and, at times, genuinely scary. If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film.

The problem is in the presentation. And it's a biggie.

Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit.

No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very, very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater.

The only way that they can salvage this film is to make a part 2 based on where it left off and use some better actors, a dialogue and a steadier camera. Reminded me of some of the old Grade ""B"" movies made in the 50's and 60's that I have watched. I guarantee you that unless you are a photojounalist and this was your paycheck, that there is no way you would continue to shoot and hold onto a camera when you are crapping your pants to get away and save your life.",1206403200,7,602,4.025
1589016,5,B00005JPXY,"I remember it well. Walking into the movie theater in summer of 1999 with friends and being so excited about seeing a little indie movie called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>. When I had seen the trailer I thought how cool the concept was: to show a movie from a video camcorder perspective (so we're there with the frightened documenters). Well, that was the only cool thing about that movie. The story, character development and direction were the worst thing I had ever seen. I remember the movie ending and feeling cheated as well as if I had just lost 86 minutes of my life I could have been seeing something much better. ""Blair Witch"" was also a joke to me because I had been camping in those same woods (in Burkittsville, MD) as a younger kid and there definitely was no spirit or ghost or killer there. And then the one good thing that came out of the ""Blair Witch"" movie faded back into obscurity: the cool idea that a movie be shot from a character's perspective a la typical video camcorder.

Then came J.J. Abrams (creator and producer genius of shows like ""Felicity,"" ""Alias,"" and ""Lost""). While visiting in Japan promoting his movie directorial debut ""Mission: Impossible III,"" with his son, he saw Godzilla toys and thought that America should have its own version of the infamous radiated lizard. He contacted his crew at his production company Bad Robot. They in turn hired writer extraordinare Drew Goddard (who's written TV episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Angel,"" and ""Alias"") and director Matt Reeves (who's only directed the David Schwimmer sleeper ""The Pallbearer"" and a few episodes of ""Felicity,"" which he co-created with Abrams). I knew with Reeves, Goddard and Abrams involved that they would bring to their latest project -- entitled ""Cloverfield"" (named after the street near Abrams' office) or ""01-18-08"" (the movie didn't have an official title; even when the teaser trailer was shown before ""Transformers"") -- what was sorely missing in ""Blair Witch."" They were going to emotionally invest in the characters and have the audience feel close to the main characters with screen time.

Like most trends, they hired a cast of unknowns or up-and-comers that hardly anyone has heard of: Lizzy Caplan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mean-Girls/dp/B0002IQJ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mean Girls</a>), Mike Vogel (2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B00018D44K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>), Jessica Lucas (ABC's cancelled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-As-We-Know-It/dp/B0009F43DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life As We Know It</a>), Odette Yustman (ABC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/October-Road/dp/B000U1ZV2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">October Road</a>), the wonderful new comedian T.J. Miller (ABC's ""Carpoolers""), and excellent leading man Michael Stahl-David (NBC's cancelled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Donnellys/dp/B000S8CLR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Donnellys</a>). The producers and writers did well with imbuing this film with palpable characters who remind us of ourselves and people we know. Each character in this movie has their own story (and relationship) which is introduced creatively well in the beginning by recordings (thanks to Miller's everyman character Hud) of each character's interaction at a going-away party for Rob (Stahl-David). Also, interspersed throughout the tape -- when the current party/disaster recording is turned off -- the audience sees previously recorded footage of Rob and his love interest Beth (Yustman) on a special day together. Just when you think the movie is going to continue with these relationships, then all hell unexpectedly breaks loose.

The brilliance of this movie is its ""Blair Witch concept"" of showing the film as if it were merely found film footage (no credits at the beginning, only in the end). Of course, this film is on a much bigger scale than ""Blair Witch,"" with a monster terrorizing Manhattan. And while that seems unrealistic, it's the only unrealistic thing about this movie. What the characters do and say, the way the movie plays out is completely realistic. Unlike ""Blair Witch,"" even when there are no attacks or action sequences, ""Cloverfield"" keeps your eyes peeled to the screen; out of the entire packed audience I saw this film with, no one said a word, cracked a joke or even got up to go the bathroom. This movie is everything a disaster movie should be! A thrilling ride of adrenaline and a heart-wrenching story of survival and human emotion, ""Cloverfield"" strikes all the right chords from fright to bravery to even humor. It shows the horror of the event from the point of view of the common man on the ground who's merely trying to survive the catastrophe. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws</a>&nbsp;(with the shark, throughout most of the movie) and the original theatrical release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Empire-Strikes-Back/dp/B000FQJAJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Empire Strikes Back</a>&nbsp;(with the Wampa in the ice cave), where the ""monsters"" are not seen for a long time during their screen time, this movie uses that same approach of not showing the monster in its entirety or at all. And that works extremely well for building up the terror for the audience. I won't tell you what the monster looks like when you finally do see it, but I will say it looks nothing like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B000FA4TLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;or any interpretation of it. Of course, there also has to be another monstrous threat and it comes in the form of what I can only imagine are the equivalent of ""fleas"" for the monster, but are our size and have very big jaws and teeth. When these monsters are introduced to the lead characters (and thus to the audience), it matches the same terrifying, pulse-pounding moment in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;when Bill Paxton's character holds up the alien locater and sees that the aliens have completely surrounded them in the tunnel and are soon going to attack.

""Cloverfield"" was a wonderful monster/catastrophe film and I could easily see it at least three more times in the theater ... if not more. Kudos to Abrams, Reeves, Goddard and crew who pulled off a groundbreaking new form of cinema that the folks attached to ""Blair Witch"" tried desperately to achieve, but painfully failed. The detail that went into the effects as well as the camerawork (some done by actor Miller himself) was so flawlessly executed that I felt as if I were immersed in watching an actual documetary. I'm sure plenty of knock-off straight-to-DVD movies will soon be surfacing with Cloverfield's success, but none will even come close. Everything works with ""Cloverfield"": the story, the acting, the character development, and the direction. If this seems like the kind of movie you're in to but still aren't sure about it, go see it without hesitation! I'm sure there won't be another like it that's this good in a very long time. I've never been so wowed by a movie of this genre and can't recommend it enough. SEE IT! However, there is one caution I must tell you: You'll leave the theater wanting more. More information about the characters, more follow-up, more movie (director Reeves even hinted at looking closely at the background at the very end of the movie for something in the Coney Island scene and staying until the very end of the credits for a voice clip from a radio transmission)! This movie is phenomenal! Like me, most viewers will want to see ""Cloverfield"" over and over again. And that's a true mark of any film's success.

And for those skeptical that this DVD release will be what studios did for the DVD release of ""Zodiac"" and other blockbusters in the past -- releasing a regular version with no special features one month, then only to re-release a DVD loaded with special features 6-7 months later (this is referred to as ""double-dipping"") -- the special features for the upcoming DVD release of ""Cloverfield"" have been revealed by Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment as of March 18. Now let's just hope they go with some better, more cooler packaging than the stupid poster art; something that fits the style of the movie (I want a ""top secret"" government slip case and package to make it look like it's an actual piece of government evidence). Here are the special features:

1589017,5,B00005JPXY,"When reviewing Cloverfield obvious comparisons to movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;are easy to make, but this film is so much more then a simple monster bash. Cloverfield is a wild mix of Godzilla like monster fun, blended with The Blair Witch Project camera style and Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition) like suspense all blended together to make one of the most perfect monster/disaster/horror films of the modern day.

First off lets give some credit to the incredible job the producers did marketing this film. For all the months leading up to its release potential viewer's searched the internet for clews as to what this film may be about, all to no avail. No movie I've ever seen has been surrounded by so much mystery. What is it really about? Is it a giant monster? Aliens? Government tests? What? You really have to see it (or read reviews on Amazon) to find out.

The movie is shot completely, from beginning to end, on a hand held digital camera that different characters take turns filming with throughout the course of the movie, very much like Blair Witch Project. Although this can take some getting used to, and yes it did make me extremely dizzy and disoriented, the artistic benefits from filming a movie in this way are obvious from the beginning. Viewers are able to see enough of the action and disaster to satisfy the biggest action junky, yet enough is left unexplained that the movie doesn't at any time seem fake or scripted. You are able to see the entire story as it unfolds though the eyes of a very small group of people which allows you to identify and ultimately sympathize with them. As well as giving the movie a more personal effect, the home camera gives this movie a very post 9/11 feel. We've all seen the shots of the WTC falling in NYC and people running for their lives as the dust from the towers quickly moves down the street engulfing everything in its path. Watching the Empire State Building fall to pieces before your very eyes will bring back memories of those fateful days in 2001 when our lives changed forever. The camera style also gives this movie a very Jaws like effect. The director of this film was able to show just enough of the monster to satisfy his audience, yet also hide it enough so that by the end you still aren't quite sure what it was or what it looked like. Although there are some shots where the monster thing is in full view and staring right at the camera, it is still hard to see because the camera is of such ""poor"" quality and doesn't allow you to see much. The monster is hidden in full view, a brilliant way of building suspense that is as scary as it is original (at least in the giant monster genera).

Despite the very blatant references to 9/11 it is very refreshing to see a film that is brave enough to re-create that fateful day yet stay neutral on any political commentary. Cloverfield does not exist to pass judgment on anyone, or to give its own opinions or views on 9/11, instead it tries, and succeeds in my opinion, in showing how the events took place from the eyes of those who witness it. The movie focuses on the disaster itself, separating itself from all the political commentary and conspiracy theories that followed, and for that I give it major props for that.

Although the movie steers clear of a lot of political commentary, it does not hesitate to give us a generous helping of social commentary. What does everyone do when the see the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street? They take pictures on their camera phones of course, and then they huddle around the video camera to get a glimpse of what it was that just invaded their city. What do people do when the cops and military are preoccupied with fighting off the giant monster? They loot electronic stores and steal TV's and radios, a clear reference to the chaos that followed disaster in New Orleans and to a lesser extent Baghdad after the US invasion. People watch spongbob squarpants along with news footage of the destruction of Manhattan. Its the little things like this that are what sets Cloverfield above Godzilla and King Kong (Widescreen Edition) (as much as I love Peter Jackson) and makes it something memorable and special.

But this movie doesn't get bogged down in its social commentary and 9/11 references. in its heart of hearts Cloverfield, for all its artistic filming style and commentary, really just wants to be an action/horror movie. From the second the monster shows up in the city to the very end every minute is filled with gun battles, fighter jets flying overhead unleashing their rockets into the city, and old fashioned giant monster destroying the city fun. This is what Godzilla should have been, instead of being a Hollywood style movie, shot in a very unoriginal and cheesy style with an unimaginative script and plot, Cloverfield manages to give action on a monumental scale yet show its audience relatively little of what is actually going on. The scares in this movie resemble those found in movies like 28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition). There is a scene about halfway though the movie that takes place in an underground tunnel in almost complete darkness with all the light coming from a few dim lights in the ceiling and a night vision scope on the camera, reminiscent of similar scenes in last years sequel to 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition). This movie does not rely on cheap scares that any idiot can do, instead it slowly builds up tension and manages to keep its audience tense and scared throughout its entire running time.

Believe the hype people, this movie not only lives up to the mystery and excitement of its trailers but surpasses them. This movie has all the potential to become the next great cult classic and join the ranks of horror greats from history. Move aside Godzilla, there's a new giant monster in town.

1589019,4,B00005JPXY,"First and foremost, the buzz created by Cloverfield is well deserved. There will be people who dislike the acting, cliffhangers, or even the filming techniques. What can't be denied, however, is the epic nature of this movie, and the way in which the viewer is drawn into the chaos.

Cloverfield starts off with the beginnings of a surprise party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David). Everyone is getting together in his swanky Manhattan loft to see him on his way to a new career opportunity in Japan. His friend Lily (Jessica Lucas) and his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) are playing hosts, and it is a joyous event throughout. Then Rob's love interest Beth (Odette Yustman) shows up with a date.

The party continues on, but it's clear that Rob is not himself. It's evident because the film's humor source, Hud (TJ Miller), is filming every detail of every guest, and happens to catch a fight between Rob and Beth. Aside from that, Hud keeps gravitating towards Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), a girl in which he's extremely interested. They have evidently met several times before, but Marlena doesn't remember Hud, and definitely doesn't want anything to do with his company or the camera.

And then all hell breaks loose.

Manhattan shakes. The ground rumbles, and the tremors are palpable throughout the city. Lights go off, screams ring through the air, and it's too close not to remember the events of 9/11. The residents are frightened out of their minds. Despite initial reports of an earthquake, in no time at all, we learn that not only are the massive sounds and tremors not earthquakes, but instead they are the ear-splitting footsteps of some gigantic monster attacking the city, destroying everything in its path.

The party-goers dash for the street, where they see fireballs, massive chunks of buildings being ripped from hinges, and the Statue of Liberty's head come flying down the street like the view from pins at giant's bowling alley.

An epic battle ensues in which the group goes into the heart of the battle, as Rob, Lily, Hud, and Marlena go to find Beth, who left for her apartment after the fight. They brave the unknown, monsters that are beyond imagination, and darkness through which nothing but fear can be felt. Drawing perfectly upon fear of the unknown and the loss of sense and perception, the group makes and incredibly dangerous and scary decision to travel through the shutdown, blacked-out subway tunnels. As they're making their way through the city, they are caught in the middle of heavy fire; the military has brought countless troops, artillery, rocket launchers, and jets to saturate the monster's surroundings with bombs. It becomes clear in no time that the military is losing the battle.

The true genius of this movie is in its concept from beginning to end. The buzz leads to the anticipation; the usage of a handheld camera for the entire movie's filming style leads to the realistic chaos. In fact, the shaky, spastic, sometimes confusing camera shots are perhaps the movie's strength and weakness at the same time. While lending towards credibility, it leaves the audience wanting to see more, changing a point of view for the hopes of a split second's more viewing time. I wanted to scream a Hud - despite his diligence - to focus a bit more on the action, to ignore the fear for even a split second so I could see the monster and the destruction. The panic and fear are both understandable and realistic.

The ending leads to a desire for more. The viewer is left wanting, needing to find a more complete resolution. When I watched it at the theatre, perhaps 50 people waited through the entire list of credits for a hope of an extra scene, maybe a hint about the actual ending, even the slightest bit more information. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another monster movie, or a cheesy Godzilla movie shot through a handheld camera. It's incredibly intense and provides shock, suspense, fear, and surprise around every corner. It's wonderfully mysterious, completely original, and sets a new standard for the horror movie genre.",1206230400,16,4088,4.880403458213256

  godzilla 98 was the crappiest monster movie ever made with dragon wars in their to. cloverfield has put the fans of the monster films back in their seats. for its time godzilla 54 made in japan was the best and lasted in my opinion as the best all the way to cloverfield.
  matt reeves and jj abrams made the best monster movie for this generation and maybe the next. i just hope when cloverfield 2 comes out in 2009 (rumor) it doesn't get corney like godzilla.

I could deal with the hand held camera, though it really got to some.  What made this movie a total bust was the plot.  It was slow to begin with, but when the action started it picked up.  However it doesn't give you anything! Where the monsters came from, if they were destroyed, how they were destroyed... nothing.

The only plot it follows through on is the romance.  That plot was old and tired, same old, same old.

Oh yea, the thing I hated most: Everyone dies!  I'm not exaggerating.  I mean everyone in the movie.  Not only that, one girl is bitten by the smaller monsters, she begins vomiting and so the military hauls her away yelling that she's been infected.  They never explain what the infection is, what it does to the host.

The creatures were truly terrifying and realistic. I hope that the Academy will recognize this with some sort of SFX award come Oscar season.

The acting was what really impressed me, though. Unlike normal movies where the cast pretends the camera isn't there, these actors recognized the camera, and came across as real people in that situation. Very impressive ensemble.

I know a lot of people hated it, particularly the way it ended. At the risk of sounding very corny; I found that one way to appreciate it more is to look at it as a sort of love story. If you think of the main plot line as the Rob/Beth relationship, with the monster attack supporting it, it really is a very good movie.

I had a great time at this movie.  Some detractors have knocked it for having pretensions of artiness, but I had just the opposite impression.  This is a stripped down, no-frills monster movie.  I appreciated the device of seeing the action from the perspective of the man in the street.  We don't know where the monster came from, and we don't care.  I was also undisturbed by the shakiness of the camera; in fact, I hardly even noticed it.  Unsteady camerawork makes sense in this ""found footage"" sub-genre, adding a sheen of realism to a fantastic situation.

1589092,5,B00005JPXY,"So the camera is swinging and lofting and lurching about like a rabid bat on a blood bender, whirling and gyring and wheeling and ducking and lurching about the facial topography of a bazillion pimply, bleary eyed denizens of a New York cocktail party.

I'm getting dizzy. I'm getting a little sick. I'm really relating to the character Marlena (tasty Lizzy Kaplan, who suffers a fate that shouldn't happen to a sick dog) in the movie, who does an on-screen puke. Blarf. I'm thinking I've made a terrible mistake. I'm thinking there's 90 minutes of my life I'm not going to ever get back.

I'm wrong.

Because about 11 minutes into this thing, right about the point where the lead (Michael Stahl-David, as Rob Hawkins) is mooning about the loss of his newly beloved Beth & commiserating with brother Jason and buddy Hud (T.J. Miller soldiering on as the cameraman, by sheer chance and naivete), there's this batrachian howl of rage, or fury, or hunger, constipation (or all of the above) out over the water near Liberty Island, and the whole flick goes wild.

""Cloverfield"" is a work of insurgent genius: it's about a lonely primal howl of a very different sort---the howl of impending Extinction. And lemme tell ya, baby, it's never easy to be the scouting party headed down Dinosaur Trail.

""Cloverfield"" is what happens when man---with his 24/7 Internet and email, his up to the second cellphone coverage (except when Giant Monsters Attack!), his field artillery barrage of News on the Move, his pointless cares and useless concerns---gets rudely shouldered over in the Great Galactic Food Chain.

It's a movie of totally immersive apocalyptic art, the horror film as nerve jangling stimulant, a kind of hyperkinetic cinematic terrorism. It is brutal. It is scary. It is vicious.

And it pulled off something I considered impossible---it disturbed me. Boiled down to its guts, it's a different kind of Ground Zero, and it certainly taps edgily into the horror of 9/11: when the New York Life Building collapes, there's this great moment when a street sweeping wall of smoke and debris comes plowing down the alley and a gaggle of fugitives hunkers down behind the counters and aisles of a darkened pharmacy they've commandeered as a lifeboat against the Terror, and it sorta sets the tone.

It's a story of the Day the Earth didn't just stand still, but screamed and ran like a rabbit, and of the Monster who really took Manhattan and used it as an All-you-Can-Eat buffet table.

The remarkable thing JJ Abrams and his director Mike Reeves have done is a brilliant little trick of cinematic wizardry, by which he transforms the handheld shaky-came from annoying barrier to excruciatingly intimate portal into a once sane, recognizable world battered into Nightmare Territory.

There are some true shockers here, some things that shook me up: the glimpses of a smoke and destruction shrouded Thing working its destruction high up among the lofty spires in the clouds; the frantic shots of a writhing hateful brood which drip off its carapace like snaggle-footed lice and perambulate wildly on the ground like carnivorous Mexcian jumping beans; a girl popping like a blood blister behind the immodest blue screen of a biohazard tent; the terrible spectacle of a highrise buckled in on its neighbor or a battle-tank squashed like an aphid.

Some killjoys have posted unexpurgated screenshots of the Creature (or at least Critter #1) in all its warts-and-all CGI glory, waving dismissively that the thing is not the least bit scary.

Don't listen to them---besides, what does a still shot prove about menace? Take a gander at a photograph of John Wayne Gacey: he hardly looks like the human shark he was in 3-D life. Set him in motion, unchain his black heart and unshackle his free range menace, and the proposition is entirely different.

So it is with the menace and creeping doom of ""Cloverfield"", possibly the most engaging horror flick I've seen since ""Aliens"": it's less about a Giant Monster (though happily boasting not one, but several, and in a few varieties) and far more about the kind of total Madness that tears off the mask of Civilization and lets us see the bony grinning face of Apocalypse.

""Cloverfield"" is a wicked little mainline of pure malice and surprisingly nasty cold grue, the paranoid, deeply deranged 21st century's backhanded french kiss to Godzilla and Global Terror.

Even though is shorter than other monster movies, I found it entertaining enough. You can feel more the excitement of the story, because is filmed in in a style like if you where there filming everything with your camara
and that gives the movie more sense of realism. The movie has a couple of fun material and the audio is pretty good. And is nice to find a monster movie which has secondary monster characters, in this case, those giant ticks(or parasites, Im not quite sure) which the monster was dropping around.

1589165,4,B00005JPXY,"It took a while for ""Cloverfield"" to come to the Zenith City.  I am not sure if it has to do with the fact that we only have two movie theaters, both with ten screens apiece, or the fact that this particular chain has been fighting some of the studios over money (we had to wait over a month for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd/dp/B000TLTUL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd</a>"" to come to town.  So instead of going the first weekend I did not check out ""Cloverfield"" until today, which means I had seen the stories about how the movie was making physically ill because of all the hand held camera work.  Ever since the small craft searching for Luke and Han in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Empire-Strikes-Back/dp/B000FQJAJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Empire Strikes Back</a>"" came over the ridge and the landscape dropped away I have been away that such things in movies can make my head explode.  It is one of the reasons that I only saw the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bourne/dp/B000W07EKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bourne</a>&nbsp;movie in the theaters; I knew I could never make it through the other ones except on the small screen.  So what ever made me think I could happen ""Cloverfield"" is beyond me.

Yes, this is all my own damn fault.  I should have gone directly to the back row of the theater, but I only went back about three-quarters, and when my daughter offered to buy popcorn I should have said ""No.""  I did make a point of not watching everything in the opening act of the film (i.e., before the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the street), so that I could watch the good parts.  But it turns out that the good parts include the camera work most likely to make you look at that popcorn bucket as the world's most accommodating barf bag.  All told I probably watched a third of the movie, and half of that indirectly; however, I did listen to the whole thing and managed to sneak a peak at all of the key scenes while my head was spinning and chills went through my body (I have been listening to some of the radio dramas included in ""Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection,"" so I have recent experience with coming up with pictures in my head, even when it is spinning like a top).

Basically, ""Cloverfield"" takes ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"" approach to a giant monster movie.  For most people the only point of reference on the later will be ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>,"" which is pretty disappointing, but us older folk we can think back to not only the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gojira/dp/B000FA4TLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gojira</a>"" movie, but ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beast-From-20-000-Fathoms/dp/B0000B1OGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms</a>"" and films of that type.  The film I am reminded most of is Spielberg's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-the-Worlds/dp/B00005JNTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of the Worlds</a>,"" because it also keeps the focus on a small group trying to survive, with only the vaguest sense of what is happening; no multi-starred generals ordering troops to their deaths or scientists postulating on where the beastie has come from.  Our vantage point is a farewell surprise party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who is heading for a job in Japan.  His brother Jason (Mike Vogel), hands over the video camera to his bud Hud (T.J. Miller), and because of what the camera shows us we are able to pair the three boys up with three women: Lily (Jessica Lucas), Beth (Odette Yustman), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).  After midnight there is an initial explosion that has everybody running for the roof.  The next thing they know, everybody is running for their lives.

Of course, any sane, rationale human being would ditch the frigging video camera early on once the world goes to hell in a hand basket, but Hud is not the brightest bulb in the world and in a world where everybody stops in the middle of a monster attack to whip out their cell phones and take pictures, there is a sense that documenting the end of the world as we know it could be a good thing.  So, yes, it is a conceit that becomes pretty unrealistic by the end, but without it, there would not be a movie (Besides, the stupidest decisions of the night belong primarily to the guilt-ridden Rob).  The bigger concern with such movies is how things hold together once the monster shows up; it was almost a given in 1950s black & white science fiction movies that once the monster showed up and we got to see what it looked like things would quickly head downhill.  I think the best part of the movie come before we see the creature, with all of those images reminiscent of 9/11, but I was not disappointed by what the CGI put together.  It is just that my preference for movie monsters are more the size of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing-from-Another-World/dp/B00009NHC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing from Another World</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00000ILDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>.""

The opening pretty much indicates how this is all going to end, and the movies runs less than 90-minutes, which was a blessing.  ""Cloverfield"" is a one-trick pony, but once things start happening here they happen pretty much without respite and you have to admit that it provides the rollercoaster ride it promises, including the whole bit of making you physically ill.  The results are not great, but it is not like giving Hud a steady-cam would have improved the experience enough because such monster movies always have gaping holes in logic.

1589168,3,B00005JPXY,"Ever since we saw the teaser trailer for this film, ""Cloverfield"" has been something we've been waiting to see. More for curiosity then because the movie looked genuinely good, but hey, you have to admit that we haven't seen an advertising campaign like this in a long time. Imagine, an advertising campaign that made you WANT to see the movie! Gee, wonder why this movie did so well at the box office? Think Hollywood: What can we learn from this film? Anyway, despite all the hype and curiosity this film has garnered, it's not a great film. What it is is a great representation of the monster genre. A movie that targets a niche market, but is made well enough that it sheds some light on what the appeal to the genre is in the first place, and it doesn't make fans of the genre feel dumb for watching it.

""Godzilla"" this is not, and the movie is better off for it. What the producers did to make their film unique to know that we don't go to these movies to be intellectually involved, we go to be entertained. So out goes the story, out goes the motivations, and out goes the history of why the monster is created. There are only two things you need to know: The characters are having a going away party, and a monster starts attacking the town, therefor rudely interrupting the characters fun. There, what else do you need to know? I guess I could tell you that the movie is filmed from a digital camera, that shakes and wobbles as if the person holding the camera has never held a camera before. The result may make those with queasy stomachs nauseous with motion sickness, so you might want to keep that in mind before seeing this movie in a theater.

If there is an annoyance to be had in the film, a real annoyance, then I think it would be the motivation. Basically, the main character decides he's going to go deep into the city and save his girlfriend. The rest of the friends, as well as the camera, follow him. At some point you'd think they'd give up after little monsters pop up, military response fails to prove effective, and the bridge falls down. When they actually get to the girlfriends apartment complex they find it leaning on another building, and the main character decides he's going to go up there anyway. I know the movie needs to reach an eighty minute point, but this quest seems more and more crazy the longer it goes on.

Even though this is a monster movie, the characters should have enough sense to know that the likelihood of succeeding in this quest puts the whole team at risk for a cause that seems doomed from the start. Ah, but now I'm contradicting my own advice. There is very little reason to care about the story, only the action. And what action there is, well it's very effective. Very intense and very scary at times. This is a movie you'll want to see in a theater, for no other reason then for the audience participation.

Those closest to him are his brother Jason (Vogel), Lily (Lucas), Marlena (Caplan), and Hud (Miller).  Hud is videotaping the events when all hell breaks loose outside in downtown New York.  Buildings fall down, others explode, and the Statue of Liberty's head comes rolling down the street.  Hud keeps the camera rolling because ""people will want to know what happened.""  Soon it becomes apparent that the source of the commotion is a giant monster that is scared and apparently immune to anything the army uses against it.  Rob  and his gang must rescue Rob's crush Beth (Yustman) and get out of town before the army takes extreme action.

""Cloverfield"" is ""Godzilla"" meets ""The Blair Witch Project"".  The hand-held camera approach brings a fresh experience to the monster in a big city story.  Some may dislike the jittery camerawork, but it adds an immediacy to the story and makes you feel like you are in it.  The movie doesn't cheat either with shots of the monster.  It is shown in all its ugly glory a number of times from a distance and very close up.  It is like no movie monster previously, and it is a scared creature making its way through a strange world.  And that only makes him more dangerous.  ""Cloverfield"" is a fresh take on an old story, and I recommend checking it out.",1202774400,6,1437,4.5984251968503935
1589170,4,B00005JPXY,"I had no problems watching this film. I originally saw it at the cinema, and then again on blu-ray, and each time, I didn't feel sick, or dizzy. The majority of reviews on Amazon are one or two star reviews complaining about the camera, which quite possibly will put people off from seeing the movie. It's a film. It's a bit shaky. Get over it already.

Normally, I do get put off by all the hype surrounding movies. All the teaser trailers (the statue of liberty's head lying in the street), the internet buzz, the fact that nothing was really given away before the film was released. Too much hype can ruin a movie in my opinion. But after seeing this at the cinema and on blu-ray, I have to say, I liked it as much second time round, as I did first time.

I will agree with some other reviewers that the characters annoyed me. The only character I really liked was Marlena, played by Lizzy Caplan. (If you're thinking she looks very different from Janice Ian in Mean Girls - it's the same girl! And if anyone saw the cancelled second season of Tru Calling, she's in that too.) The rest of the characters irritated me majorly and were mostly unknowns.

Some reviewers have compared to this to The Blair Witch Project. I hated Blair Witch project. It only got good in the last 10-15 minutes. What I will say about Cloverfield, is that it keeps your attention right the way through the movie, without failing once. The film is visually stunning, to begin with a leaving party, which is quite rudely interrupted. A couple of the scenes towards the beginning reminded me of scenes from 9/11. The monster was also extremely well done, quite often if you see a monster, all the mystery & intrigue is taken away, but it's only when it's actually caught on camera close up, that you realise all the brief glimpses throughout the movie doesn't do the monster justice. The one brief glimpse will have it burned into your brain forever. Put it this away, it's in the same ranks as the predator, the alien, all the other great movie monsters. Wow what a creature. It's like lots of different parts of other creatures!

The first person viewpoint was an interesting concept, not something I thought worked in Blair Witch. You never really get to 'know' Hud that much, as you know the rest of the characters. He's only briefly seen compared to the rest of the characters, as he's always behind the camera. But since he had a bit of a thing for Marlena, it worked in that sense! And there's always shots of feet running, and very fast shots as the camera tries to catch everything that's going on. Put yourself in that position - you're not going to be running from a big scary monster, and stop to make sure the camera was off so you didn't record your feet? Or take your time to record footage on your left, when something more exciting is happening on your right? (For example.)

The effects are amazing, and work well in cinema and on blu-ray. The only thing I really didn't like was the 'flashback' scenes. (The other footage on the video camera pretty much.) They were OK, but it just didn't work quite well in my opinion.

Cloverfield is over very quickly, it seems, it passes in a breeze. After first watching in the cinema, I was not amused about walking down a dark road in order to get my bus home. Thankfully, I did jump as much as I did in the cinema when I saw the helicopter scene second time around.

Overall I would recommend Cloverfield. Ignore the reviewers who complain about the camera - watch the film, emmerse yourself in the feeling that you're in control of the camera, and what you would do in that situation, and you'll get on quite well.",1202688000,,3652,4.474474474474475
1589171,3,B00005JPXY,"Well, ""The Descent"" or ""The Host"" is not.  This movie doesn't rewrite the monster-movie flick but the amusement-ride-film.  By now yo know what it is about: what if the next alien-monster-disaster destroying New York was filmed by a bystander for us to see?  Nice initial idea, but not enough thinking about what to do next.  Why not go to the extreme and use the videos other people made that day?  Alternating between them?  Some bystanders filming others?  A journalist with his cameraman so as to get somebody with a motivation to get close to the monster? (a cliche, but a logical way to do it).
Well, I didn't like them stealing from ""The Descent"" (night-vision moment in the subway), but it was worth my 3 US dollars (cinemas in Argentina are cheap if you go at the matinee).",1202601600,2,782,4.6231884057971016

Everyone by now knows the premise of the filming of a loft party being interrupted by the arrival of a giant monster in Manhattan, so I won't go into loads of description over that. I'm a firm believer in the fact that the camera is the eyes of the person watching the film and with Cloverfield (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;before it) we are put right into the central character's shoes as he stumbles around the darkest corners of the city with his ever diminishing group of friends.

It's been repeated a million times, but I too believe that what we DON'T see is scarier than what we do. Once you bring the monster out of the shadows all the mystery and fear evaporates. For the majority of the movie we never really get to see all of the monster, perhaps a tentacle here or a foot there, but not much of the whole thing. We do get to see a lot of the ugly parasites that cling to its body however.

There are some brilliant and eternally memorable scenes in Cloverfield, the best being hard to nail down but I loved the idea of entering a crooked skyscraper via the deserted tower that it's leaning against. What a truly unique set-piece.

Of course the movie is going to have it's critics and there will be plenty who are not satisfied with the ending. JJ Abrams has said that he plans to do a single sequel from another point of view, but I feel this will ruin the magic.

In fact, JJ Abrams' marketing campaign and back-story has already tarnished the film for me a little bit. He has stated that the monster comes from the sea but I prefer to not know for certain where it comes from. I imagined it coming from outer space myself as the idea of a random creature arriving from the infinite darkness of space to far more terrifying than a monster from the limited environment of our own oceans. And the viral marketing is way out of hand. Let me put set it all straight.

Rob Hawkins has been made vice president of a company in Japan. That company is the Slusho soft drink firm. Marlena is seen drinking plenty of Slusho at the beginning of the film. The parasites on the creature apparently eat the secret ingredient of Slusho deep in the ocean. They smelled this on her, which explains why she is the only one of the group who is bitten. The near-unnoticeable 'splash' in the water at the end of the film is part of a satellite which has fallen out of space and apparently wakes up the monster somehow.

What a load of garbage! Is Rob Hawkins the center of the universe or something? Why is all this contrived crap revolving around him? Why they came up with this drivel instead of leaving it all unexplained is beyond me. Nevertheless, I will still be looking forward to the sequel next year.

The Blu Ray features a brilliant 1080p 1.78:1 picture with Dolby TrueHD and loads of extras. It's a must buy!",1202601600,,3715,5.06873977086743
1589243,3,B00005JPXY,"I really was hoping for a more classic monster film not unlike the godzilla films but with a newer twist. well I got part of that deal. the cgi monster scenes and building destruction were all done very well and quite realistic. However, the camera jerking around about every 15 seconds truly does seem to dizzy you a bit. (this was the directors idea to make it seem as if amature filmographers were filming this. the effect is realistic but still annoying) which bothered me and the sound can get almost Nerve grating with the background talking at the party to the screaming. then there is truly a lack of a story other then as of you were watching someones turned in film of a monster attack on new york without having ben edited by the news station. although there are some highlights to this film such as watching a tank and military with bazookas etc running around new york (considering 9/11 was surprised to see a tank!) also as I stated before some of the city destruction scenes were stunningly done and very realistic. also the critter itself was a really new type of monster that you really would want to run from very quickly. and the little ones were just so spider like and nasty as to truly make sure if the big one didn't make you run those should. not these kids though. the main character (who's unfortunate going away party this was) absolutely HAS to get to his EX-Girlfriend to save her from this beastie that has demolished a good part of new york. that's a little much for me. this film was done in a very annoying ""Blair witch project"" style with jerky camera motions (if you get motion sick bring drammamine) and while was done way better, can not garner more then 3 stars from me because the sound and annoying video just killed a good 2 stars off this one for me.

CGI: excellent special effects 5 stars.

Video quality: 1 star horribly annoying jerking motions throughout the film (too add realism but still...) 2 stars could have been done realistic without being a complete nooblet to filming. my cousins kids can do better.

Sound: Horrible in most of the beginning and towards the end cannot hear the people too well due to the background chatter and noise (again for realism and it makes it seem real but about as amusing as watching a poorly filmed home video) 1 star

acting and Overall: acting was ok about what you would expect from most of the kids (with the daft exception of the guy and his ex.) and the film while really superbly done in some spots has so many flaws I cannot give more then 3 stars to a film that finally had the potential to be a masterpiece.

1589244,5,B00005JPXY,"I find it a very appropriate time period to release a film such as Cloverfield, a movie that documents that self-preservation is now less instinctive than ensuring the survival and safety of a loved. And to me the reason bring this up is because of these disaster-ridden times in a post-911 world, terror could rear its' ugly head at any given moment and it wouldn't matter your social, financial or even status of power at that point; all that would matter is what matters most to you. Here in Cloverfield the concept of a gigantic alien (or to those who love to debate `aliens') may seem far removed from anything that could happen in reality but the scenario played out is indeed plausible.

The story of Cloverfield is rather simple we are introduced to Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is a twenty-something hot shot corporate who is off to the shores of Japan to start a new career path. The first 15 minutes are documented with Rob holding the camera then passing it off to his older brother Jason (Mike Vogel). Eventually Jason meets HUD played by T.J. Miller (notice the clever name as in Heads Up Display) who they pass the camera off to. Jason tells HUD to hold the camera and have everyone give testimonials about what their thoughts are about Rob leaving overseas. Eventually after making his rounds in the party HUD goes outside after Rob is pissed off about hearing that his ex-girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman) brought over another guy. After HUD and Jason sit down and consult Rob about his girl troubles we hear a loud explosion and for 5 minutes of suspended time seem to be in a New York 9/11 all over again. What could have possibly did this? Eventually Rob, HUD and Jason get stuck with Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) and Jason's girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas).

What really drives me to feel Cloverfield is how it isn't told in a similar fashion as most movies of its' kind are. Instead of the main characters who have connections with authorities such as the military and eventually all uniformly come together to neutralize the problem (or as in this case the monster at hand). Instead these are normal everyday people they are helpless and all they could possibly do is just try to survive. It goes back to that thing that the importance of protecting those close to us is greatly magnified in a situation like this. So Rob with all 4 of his friends begin running with everyone else to escape only for Rob to get a voicemail on his cell phone from Beth who says she is not ok. I give props to truly great usage of sound and editing, this beloved brainchild has been woven together to truly create a great sense of hysteria and pandemonium. When the military first make their way and HUD is holding the camera in hand all he can do is watch Rob, Marlena and Lily from afar as bullets fire loudly in the air. Call it horror for a modern-day Youtube generation but there is no denying that the way the film was shot will cause indefinite polarity between views. For some, the Blair Witch Project style camera is a work of sheer art making this movie that much more realistic since we only get to see what's on the camera. Then there are those who will feel a great deal of discomfort and nausea in which there have been reports of people leaving the movie early due to wanting to vomit or dizziness. I fall more into the first category and truly feel the cinematography couldn't have been expressed as well without delving into this type of medium.

Not being able to see everything in perfect scope is perhaps what I find most endearing about Cloverfield. You never get a good shots of the monster as it's a je ne sais quoi (difficult object to define) monstrous deviation. We never hear of its' orgin or why all this happened. Was it something harvesting and manifesting its life under water surviving off of Slushos' ingredients? Or was this something the government made? Oh wait I know it came from space? There you go Cloverfield is shrouded in so much mystery and don't even get me started on the ending. Which in itself could leave some scratching their head thinking what the hell just happened in the last 84 minutes. That my friends is what I like most about this movie, it's attempt at taking the shackles off and breaking conventionalism. It could have spoon-fed us every detail and end the appropriate Hollywood fashion but that would make it nothing more than a doppelganger of every other monster affair.

Granted Cloverfield isn't perfect, it's a rather short film and I couldn't help but wonder if there was more than one monster...the one that HUD captures in the end on his camera is a lot shorter than the one tearing down the walls of NYC. Regardless though the movie casted more unknown actors who don't act or say the most appropriate lines because they are regular individuals reacting to a situation such as this...just imagine if Tom Cruise or Johnny Depp were running wild in the streets of Manhattan (you would get War of the Worlds). Great special effects, shaky camera that some will love and some will hate, a excellent sense of mystery and never truly finding out what is going on coupled with top notch sound make Cloverfield a real treat in an otherwise bland January when most movie goers don't have much to look for. It all must have done something to most movie goers and many critics and movie aficionados are still trying to recap what they just saw.

1589245,5,B00005JPXY,"This movie is only part of another movie and if you put it into relation to the other pieces - sequel in 2009 (as stated on IMDB), the many related web sites and the facebook sites of the characters - this is a brilliant concept.
The movie itself, is only one part of the whole show. If you look it at as a stand-alone product, it may deserve 3 stars but if you take the concept and the things to come into account, it gets 5 from me.
JJ Abrams is following his very successful LOST scheme - open endings, mysteries, hints. And he just re-invented the monster movie genre which I thought was dead. What could have come after dozens of Godzilla, The Thing, The Blob and so on movies? It was over.
However, he made a refreshing start, entertaining the audience, making people curious for more.
I see this movie as a - usually - small part of a monster movie. Remember the lost video footage found by the military at the beginning of this kind of movies? Not showing too much but giving you a glimpse of the monster.
Well, that is this film in my understanding. But not only a short clip, it is nearly a full movie, but still parts are missing.
What did I learn from this story? I know now a part of the story - only a part. But I want to know the whole story. What will I do? Watch the sequel. Meanwhile I check all the hidden sites and hints in the Internet.
Brilliant marketing concept and instead that somebody holds a sign right in my face reading in big red letters 'BUY THIS', I have to get involved, do something on my own to find the clues to satisfy my curiosity.
Wow, this is brilliant marketing and very entertaining too.
Coming back to the movie itself, the story has been told several times but not in this way and that makes it original plus the things to come and the bread crumbs in the Internet.
Also the movie is pretty close to reality and is told logical. I couldn't find any major plot holes. The actors are very believable in their roles and the props and FX were just so well done, that I was completely in the movie.
Therefore a 5 star rating from me - besides the shaky camera, but this is part of the plan and stirs the discussion.
I can also recommend to read the FAQ for the movie on IMDB - very interesting.",1202428800,,2234,4.20979020979021
1589246,4,B00005JPXY,"I went to see this movie right after a visit of a modern art museum. This movie caught me still in a creative mode/mind so I give it 3.5.

The scenario begins with a lost-and-found tape recording a party of the protagonist's friends as a spider-liked monster spawns its attack in NYC.

The whole movie is presented by a video camera with an amazing battery life and features with a night vision?! Inevitably, you will experience some motion sickness while watching this flick as well as a mind-twist--a theme of this movie. Friendship? Romance? Or a 911 of a mutation monster?
At the end, it even leaves a clue for a sequel in the video tape, and I can't help but wonder what would that be? Another video taping story?

The credit should give to this brave director who makes it fun to watch as if it's a virtual reality SciFi game and laugh about several lame actions and conversations.",1202083200,5,887,4.53125
1589247,5,B00005JPXY,"Because everyone and their dog has a cell phone with a camera--or a handheld video cam--there is no doubt the next horrific catastrophe will be captured on video for all the world to see (on YouTube).  Which is why CLOVERFIELD, despite its wacky premise (a Godzilla-like monster/demon destroying the Big Apple), struck me as so very real.  As soon as the ""event"" began to happen, I immediately and effortlessly suspended disbelief, and got into this movie, which fascinated through every frame.

I've heard comparisons made to ""Blair Witch Project""; yet Blair was laughable sophistry (we're supposed to be scared because the characters find little props in the woods).  CLOVERFIELD shows us the real deal--there's definitely a monster under the bed, and he's a force to be reckoned with.  We follow a group of friends (who ad lib superficial, melodramatic lines, but come on, people say stupid stuff when they're frightened) who don't run from the monster. . .they run towards all the terror to ""rescue"" an injured ex-girlfriend.  All the while, destruction and carnage reign supreme (the special effects are spellbinding), and our friends pay the ultimate price for all their dodging and weaving.  The climactic scene is a definite eye-opener.

With its queasy, handheld camera motion, CLOVERFIELD looks and feels all too real.  Which makes for one very entertaining night at the cinema--motion sickness or not.

1589248,5,B00005JPXY,"Saw Cloverfield a few days ago, and felt compelled to review it. This movie was awesome. Other reviews I've read have criticized the film because the characters aren't particularly memorable or likable. Granted, but I think that criticism misses the point and misunderstands the genre. Horror movies have gotten a lot of mileage out of thin characters, and this one is doing the same thing. (bonus points for choosing NY hipsters as the monster chow)

The point of the movie is not the characters, it's the whole idea. Movies like Cannibal Holocaust and Blair Witch Project have used the recovered footage conceit before, but Cloverfield takes the prize because of how well JJ Abrams and co. seemlessly integrate very convincing effects and quality production. Anyhow, to wrap it up, this move is intense and a lot of fun. Check it out and don't take it too seriously.",1201910400,,868,4.904761904761905
1589249,4,B00005JPXY,"I was very skeptical about Cloverfield. I'm extremely critical of anything new that comes out of Hollywood, especially when it's a story of destruction taking place in New York (Plenty of originality there, eh) I even walked out of 'I am Legend' and got a refund because I've had enough of paying for movies that are worse than popular TV, but I'm glad to say that Cloverfield delivered on its hype. There was a time when movies used to do this often, partly because no CG meant more effort on the script and story, partly because I was about 8 years old, but either way, blockbusters do tend to disappoint. When Cloverfield began I was thinking 'Oh no, this is obviously scripted which takes away from the realism, the editing is far too  precise for it to be be just a guy with a camera and it looks like it's shot on film rather than video' which also bothered me, but none of that matters. There are still things that niggle at me in places, but overall the film eases you in well and when everything kicks off, it's one of the most exciting rides I've experienced in the cinema. I can imagine Cloverfield theme park rides opening up in Universal studios much like the amazing Alien Wars experiences that are apparently still scattered around. There's plenty of imagination and it stuck to the widely known but frequently avoided rule that what you don't see is more interesting than what you do see. See it in the cinema, it's a thrill ride, however the film suffers from a tacked on final few minutes which feels like an alternative/extra ending, and it brings the believability of the film down completely, and left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth because it was just so pointless. But aside from that, very well planned and directed and I recommend it. And I hated the camera shaking in the Bourne Films because it's just as easy to hold the camera still. In this however it didn't bother me in the slightest. Added to the claustrophobia of the film. Not a great masterpiece (Although there are masterful moments) but it is what it says it is and that's very rare nowadays, so check it out.",1201910400,,2106,4.513089005235602

If you got bitten, you would seem okay but sometime later you will feel faint and explode.  The characters did a very good job portraying the action.  The scene at the end doesn't give you any insight except death so you have to see it and find out everything in between.

1589251,5,B00005JPXY,"Just like many of you, when I saw the preview for this film I instantly dubbed it ""a must see"". What can I say? Something about the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the streets of Manhattan had me hooked. More importantly I couldn't wait to find out what exactly was causing this carnage. So it was with great expectations I strapped myself in for what was sure to be an incredible ride.

Now I could go on and on here about who the cast is but you would have no idea who I'm talking about. That's one of the things that really make this film work. There are no mega-stars on screen threatening to steal the spotlight from the story. I'm a huge fan of J.J. Abrams' work thanks to both Alias and Lost, so I was excited that he produced the movie. Everything he touches lately seems to turn to gold and this movie is certainly no exception.

The story is actually very simple. The entire film is shot from a hand-held camera giving us the point of view of a small group of friends who are trying to get out of New York. As the story unfolds we learn that a monster is destroying the city and the military is called in to stop the beast and evacuate the citizens. As these friends try to flee for safety, they unwillingly find themselves closer to danger.

This is not a film that offers answers and explanations, but rather we are only exposed to the minimal knowledge these friends have. They don't care where this monster came from or how it can be stopped. All they want to do is get out alive and help each other get there. I've read several reviews where people hated this aspect of the movie, but I have to admit it really worked for me. I love when filmmakers and writers think outside the box and Cloverfield is an excellent example.

The special effects and production value are top-notch and I found myself constantly wondering how they filmed certain scenes. This is one movie that will really immerse you into the experience and several times I had to remind myself to breathe because of the intensity. The subway scene in particular is breathtaking and wonderfully terrifying.

There are lots of reports out about the jerky camera shots causing people to feel nauseous. Unfortunately, I can testify that this is indeed true. Whatever the condition is called, I have it. Several times I found myself having to look away from the screen because of the motion sickness I felt. However, the movie was so good and so involving that I couldn't look away for long and was able to fight through it. This move made me sick and I loved every second of it!",1201737600,,2566,4.427966101694915
1589252,4,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"", the new film from producer JJ Abrams (TV's ""Lost"" and ""Alias"", director of ""Mission Impossible III""), is an interesting, very successful experiment in filmmaking.

Rob (Michael Stahl - David) has just received a promotion and a new job in Japan (wink, wink). Before he leaves, his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas), arrange a surprise party in Rob's midtown Manhattan loft. Jason videotapes the day, borrowing Rob's video camera and videotaping over a tape Rob made of a special day he spent with Beth (Odette Yustman) a week or so earlier. When Rob arrives at the party, his best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is in charge of videotaping the events, so Rob will have a keepsake. Everyone is having a good time until Beth shows up with another guy. But Rob barely has time to think about this when the entire building shakes. Everyone rushes to the roof and they see an explosion and chaos near the Hudson River. They rush inside and the news is carrying a story about an oil tanker hitting the Statue of Liberty. They make their way to the street and an explosion a couple of blocks away causes panic. Soon, the head of the Statue of Liberty comes crashing through and pandemonium reigns. Rob, Jason, Hud and Lily try to get someplace safe and they soon realize New York City is being attacked by a large beast. Soon, Rob receives a teary cell call from Beth, who left earlier. Rob is determined to make his way to her apartment and help her. As they proceed, they run into all manner of obstacles and no one is safe. At least Hud is smart enough to keep the camcorder rolling during their journey.

The problem with so many monster movies is the filmmakers show the monster way too soon. This is problematic for a variety of reasons. If the monster is, in the slightest, unconvincing, there is no hope of creating any suspense with the audience. Once they see an actor wearing a big rubber suit, or a CGI creation moving awkwardly, nothing else in the film will seem real enough and all hope is lost. If the monster is convincing, and we believe in it, showing it too soon also robs the film of suspense. Once we see the creature, we are no longer thinking about what the creature might be, what caused it to be created, what are the creature's motivations. This opens the rest of the film up for scrutiny. Trust me, most filmmakers who are making a monster film, don't want to invite this scrutiny.

Abrams and director Matt Reeves conceived an idea in which the entire film is presented as a Government file, top secret, and obtained from the videotape Hud and Jason shoot throughout the day. Because this is all handheld camera work, the camera turns to look for the source of noises or destruction. The monster destroys something, causing a noise or disturbance, and then Hud and the others turn to look. Naturally, the monster isn't still standing in the same place. If they are lucky, they capture a bit of a leg or a tail on the video before running away. They use this technique in a smart way; because we are watching someone's camcorder, it takes a long time for us to get a good look at the monster, allowing the film to ratchet up the suspense, putting the main characters in a number of situations keeping us on the edge of our seats.

The filmmakers have also smartly cast a group of complete unknowns to play the principals in the film. Because we don't recognize any of the actors, we more readily accept they are young people living in New York, we more readily accept they are attending a surprise party for their friend Rob, we more readily accept we are watching a camcorder recording this party and all of the horrific events after it.

This film wouldn't work as well if recognizable actors populated the world. ""Move Jessica Alba, move, the monster is about to get you"" is just harder to make work than ""Rob, you really shouldn't go down that dark subway tunnel"". Who's Rob? He's the guy whose going away party was interrupted by a monster attacking the Statue of Liberty. Wait, that's not real? Oh.

Thankfully, with the advent of digital camcorders, the images in ""Cloverfield"" are quite good, pretty clear. This isn't ""The Blair Godzilla Project"", filled with grainy, dark images. This camcorder captures a lot of detail and gives us a pretty good view of the destruction, of the terror, of the aftermath of this monster's visit.

As Rob and his friends make their way through New York, they meet various obstacles along the way, frightening, dangerous obstacles, adding to the suspense of the film. They work through these moments, trying to remain safe, trying to remain alive, trying to get to Beth.

As the film begins, we watch as Rob and Beth wake up in bed together and make some plans to visit Coney Island. Then Jason and Lily at the market, buying some things for the party that night, interrupt the images. They quickly fill us in on the details and it becomes clear Jason has borrowed Rob's video camera and he is clearly videotaping over something else. Throughout the film, these moments with Rob and Beth come through, whenever Hud stops the camera, or there is a brief interruption. Watching these moments of Rob and Beth together help to explain why he is so intent on finding her, making his way through the hazardous streets of New York under attack. These moments also help to add one more moment to the film, making the fact we are watching a handheld camera recording all of these horrific events all the more credible.

The film also moves at a fast pace. After spending some time with everyone as they prepare for the party and then meeting everyone at Rob's big night, the monster attacks. These early scenes are necessary to give us the framework for the story. We have to have someone to care for and go on this journey with. But once the monster attacks, our group of partiers is always on the go, trying to stay alive and as far away from this creature as possible. At 90 minutes, the film never lags, providing us with a bit of a roller coaster ride.

""Cloverfield"" isn't for everyone; I know a lot of people who can't watch a few minutes of handheld camera work, let alone an entire film. But it is a very good, interesting filmmaking experiment managing to create more suspense and terror than most monster films.",1201737600,,6318,4.603019538188277

OK, the basic premise for this film is a group of 'Dudes' in manhatten are having a whale of a time at this guys leaving do, when a huge godzila-like monster starts rampaging through the streets. The good guy(forgot his name, sorry!) had a mini fight with the girl he loves and now amongst the devistation, departs on a rescue mission with, umm this moody chick and this other chick and Hud, the guy thats filming all this, who has a severe case of the shakes at the most passive of times. Now, its a good film, it really is! If you could get through blair witch you can get through this, just. If not, i don't reccomend it. I left with a headache, but hey I knew it was going to be a bit choppy. The 4 pints of cider didn't help, but its wanna those films that you just need to go along to. If you suffer from motion sickness don't go, it as simple as that.",1201651200,,869,4.087719298245614
1589294,5,B00005JPXY,"First and foremost, enter this film knowing that you're not going to get any answers. No brilliant scientist or smart mouthed guy is going to explain what is happening halfway through.  The main characters know about as much as we would know if this was happening to us. That's one of the brilliant touches with Cloverfield, that nothing is spoon fed to us.  I'm a bit bored with movies that over explain everything so Cloverfield's ambiguity and less-is-more attitude is refreshing.

Outside of that, this is one of the most original (after giving props to Godzilla and Blair Witch Project) and exciting monster movies I have seen in a long time that exceeds the hype surrounding it. Yes, there's some shaky camera work, yes the character's actions are a bit far fetched and yes it raises more questions than answers (did the soldiers shoot the girl or did she explode?) but I didn't have a problem with that at all.  I was on the edge of my seat, my heart machine gun pounding against my chest, from the first explosion to the last. This is what a movie going experience is all about:  complete immersion in the story from first frame to last.

My only beef is Hud. He says Rob's name at least a half million times during the course of the movie which drove me slightly crazy. I was half expecting him to profess his undying love for Rob or something.

CHeck this one out if you love monster and sci-fi movies, especially ones that are done very well.  I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD.",1201651200,,1502,4.4963235294117645

It felt so real, because of the first prospective style, that I felt like I was there with them. The camera jerkiness is appropiate and not as overwhelming as I expected. There is a little bit of everything in this movie; Some shots of the falling buildings and running crowds will unfortunately remind you of the 9/11 tragedy, so watch it at your own discretion. The small nasty looking creatures are similar to some oversized face huggers from the movie ALIENS and some shots in the movie will remind you of that. Yes there is virtually no explanation about the origins of the monster and it's actions, but this is not that kind of movie. I also felt that the end was not disappointing either (definitely open for a sequel), this is an amateur movie shot by a bunch of people who were unlucky enough to get stock right in the middle. By the way, the monster is seen enough to get an idea of what it looks like, and it is about as big as godzilla but the arm span is much wider. Overall:EXCELLENT!",1201564800,2,1165,4.398148148148148
1589296,2,B00005JPXY,"The giant alien rips off the head of the statue of liberty from downtown manhattan.  Downtown Manhattan, and not ellis island.  The seemingly invincible giant alien/monster spews little clones of the arachnids from starship troopers which are not invincible.  Add to that the fact that the movie seems like it was filmed by a fish flopping around on dry land, and we have a movie.  The holes in time with no holes in story, the lack of story anyway, as the whole movie is based on character reaction, and the classic runny nose ""I'm sooo scared"" scene from the handheld camera, and we have a legendary source for bad-movie jokes.

Aside from all that, the movie was ambitious.  It was creative and outside the box.  It attempted to show power and emotion in reality as opposed to romanticizing a story, and it's use of effects of taping over a previously recorded tape was a nice way to add to development.

I say it's a completely bad movie, but it's still much more worth your admission price than several of the multiple oscar winners of the last few years.  The kind of movie they attempted here should be watched, and remembered for their ambition to make a good movie that doesn't follow the standard formula.

I have to admit, I've been wanting to see this ever since the viral trailer of the Statue Of Liberty's head flying along the NYC streets first hit the web. And while the movie is pretty darn good for what it is, the hype may have crippled my expectations.

The first 10 minutes are an introductory send-off party for Rob, put together by his galpal Lily and brother Jason. Rob's bud Hud is given a shaky videocam to gather testimonials and work up a sweat over Marlena. All his rather self-absorbed friends cluster in the apartment for a late-night booze-up and to spout off bad dialog. Seems Rob's being promoted to some hotshot VP position in (he heh) Japan, when his girlfriend Beth shows up and it's made clear she is about to become an ex. Just as Rob is pouting about crappy girlfriends blowing him off, a very Japanese monster crash lands in Brooklyn with a such a clatter, so everyone rushes outside to see what is the matter. The aforementioned Statue Head goes flying and, before you can say World Trade Center, a collapsed building has our vacuous party-goers (with Hud still holding the camera) fleeing a wall of debris racing up the street.

So just like those old 50's B Movie Monsters of old, ""Cloverfield"" substitutes a creepy lizard for our anxieties about creepy Islamofacists. After being forced to watch these yuppie wankers party for about 20 minutes and not giving a rat's beak about them, the movie suddenly kicks into high gear and never lets up. Since everyone else here has griped about the single camera theory, I'll add my two cents. It Was Not Necessary. I mean, even the less expensive DV's these days have stabilizers. However, the racing-up-the-street shots and the subway tunnel piece add to the panicky, claustrophobic nature of ""Cloverfield,"" as does the stumbling comments by our remaining four bewildered would-be rescuers. Seems Rob got a call from ex-Beth, he's feeling valiant in the face of danger, and he somehow manages to convince Hud, Lily, and Marlena to follow him on a rescue mission.

That is the plot, in a monster-shell. Hud dutifully films away and cracks bad jokes, but the humor does help blunt the sharpness. The effects - aside from the Dramamine Camera Work - are pretty stunning, too, like the apartment buildings crashed into each other that our rescuers are forced to scale. The military battles are crazed and frenzied, and the mini-monsters that drop off the Mother Monster are inventive. The Monster itself is given added bonus points for being more scary by NOT being seen, then when Hud finally gets a good look at the creature near the movie's end, it really does shock you.

The ending was a bit corny, frankly. The Coney Island underlying recording seemed contrived in a movie that is already all about the gimmick. Along with the dizzying camera work, it's the sole other bum note in a movie that nails its genre desires right on the head. By keeping ""Cloverfield"" to a very taut under 90 minute running time (take out the cuss words and this would have been a Sci-Fi channel movie of the week), it drags you along for the thrill-ride and stops just before you get tired of its one trick filming style. By then, you're tabulating the influences and trying to backtrack, which made this a satisfying if somewhat unfulfilling movie for me.",1201392000,2,3855,5.173076923076923

1589299,2,B00005JPXY,"The idea, conceived by producer J.J. Abrams, is brilliant, and the story told here is exciting, riveting stuff. It's tense and, at times, genuinely scary. If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film.

The problem is in the presentation.

Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit.

No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater.

1589300,4,B00005JPXY,"Internet buzz and rabid speculation surrounded Cloverfield for months, prior to its release on January 18th 2008...The question is: Now that it's finally here--Does the film live up to all of the hype? I say Yes.

The Story: On the night of May 22, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) throw a surprise going-away party for Jason's brother, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), after he lands a big job promotion that's gonna relocate him to Japan. Just prior to the guest of honor's arrival, Jason asks ""Hud"" (T.J. Miller) to chronicle the festivities of Rob's last night in the U.S. with a hand held camcorder. At first, he is quite reluctant to do so, But as soon as he notices that the object of his affection, Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), is in the room, Hud's ready to roll.

Shortly after Rob finally arrives, an argument erupts between Rob and his friend, Beth (Odette Yustman), and Rob confides to his close friends that they had hooked up a month ago. Rob is mad because Beth has arrived with a date. Beth is upset at Rob for not calling her after getting together. She leaves the party abruptly. Hud and Jason then encourage Rob to pursue a romantic relationship with Beth despite the fact he's leaving the country.

Suddenly the building rocks with earthquake intensity as loud animal-like noises can be heard outside. From the roof, the friends see a large explosion in the distance and they flee to the street where the head of the Statue of Liberty crashes to the ground. Several more explosions and glimpses of a ginormous creature are visible in the distance... The small group of pals decide that the best way to ensure their survival is to leave Manhattan--But first--they must rescue Beth.

The Film: Word is that J.J. Abrams was in line to direct this monster tale, but because he decided to helm the Star Trek reboot, Matt Reeves was asked to step in...No worries though, Cloverfield has plenty of Abrams' style all over it...

As written by Drew Goddard the script is exceedingly straightforward and uncluttered--which is one reason why it works. The beginning of the film took me right back to September 11, 2001, with it's stark dismantling of Lady Liberty and scenes of folks running for their lives as utter chaos rains down everywhere.

The media has made a big deal over the fact that the ""always in motion"" cinematography has hit some viewers in the gut--causing disorientation and dizziness--I had no trouble at all with that aspect of the film. I was too caught up in the plight of Rob and company...

The filmmakers offer just enough of a glimpse of the monster so that we the audience are intrigued to know what the characters are facing-but they wisely keep that to a minimum--Allowing the characters to carry the load rather than special effects or CGI. To that end, the cast does a great job of keeping it ""real"" amid the unreality of it all...

It's impossible not to think of the 1999 film The Blair Witch Project which Cloverfield patterns itself after, for sure. From its mysterious marketing campaign, the style of filming--Using no name stars--to its ""ambiguous"" conclusion. It's all there.

To me, there's nothing wrong with letting the viewer try and figure things out...Not every flick has to explain the who what and why-for it to work. I just hope that despite the film's success-everyone resists the temptation of a sequel, ala`Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. My way of thinking is that that would only serve to to diminish Cloverfield as a film--if there is a sequel--Leave it alone guys...

As is often the case with TV's Lost--Cloverfield poses more questions than it answers. But unlike the serialized drama-I am totally OK with that...

For what it is, it's a great monster movie that is a worthy trip to the cineplex...",1201392000,,3781,4.76605504587156
1589301,3,B00005JPXY,"Think ""Blair Witch"" meets ""Godzilla"" meets ""War of the Worlds"".
A monster attacks NYC and You Are There... thanks to a group of twenty-something yuppies who happen to be making a home movie when the attack occurs. They leave the camcorder rolling--""to document the event""--while they run for their lives, from one scary gory scene to the next.  Ok, that wouldn't really happen, but hey, this is a sci-fi horror flick, so let's pretend and see where things go...

The film is nothing more than the video shot by the characters as the action unfolds.  It's a creative device that provides great realism.  We see events occur from the eyes of those experiencing them, complete with jerky camera movements, as the filmmaker reacts to horrific events.  You really do feel like you are there, with all the fear and shock of living through a nightmare.  Which begs the question:  why would anyone want to see anything like that?  But for those that enjoy films of this genre because they are adrenaline junkies and like to be scared out of their wits, this film will be all that you could want.

Yet there are problems with sticking to the camcorder perspective.  First, the camera is poorly operated, meaning all during the film everything is tilted, jerky, blurry, etc.  It's hard to sit through 90 minutes of that.  It's also difficult to get to know, or care about, any of the characters when all you know of them comes from brief poorly-filmed video clips unfolding in real time.  The plot line involves these characters bravely trying to rescue each other and save themselves.  It could have been emotionally powerful, but we feel strangely detached, because we haven't connected with these people and we are watching all the action through distracting camera shots.

But the biggest limitation is that we can only ever get a narrow view of what is a grand spectacle, and we can never know more than what the characters know.  Think of it:  a monster is traipsing through Manhattan yet all we can see are glimpses of it through a jerky camera.  As a sci-fi fan, I wanted to know more about the monster:  where did it come from, what were it's intentions, what could the government do against it, etc.  The film tries to compensate for those limitations by allowing the characters to see TV news reports and go up in a helicopter where we get a bird's eye view of the destruction.  But it wasn't enough for me.  My questions were never answered, and I found the ending very unsatisfying.

Sci-fi horror films of an era can reflect the collective fears of the time.  During the 50's, it was the Soviet Union, showing up as aliens threatening our way of life.  This film clearly draws inspiration from the attacks of 9/11.  The monster represents our fear of the terrorist threat, arriving without warning and taking aim at symbols of our culture (here, the Statue of Liberty) before trying to destroy everyone and everything for no apparent reason.  In that sense, perhaps the film is merely a reflection of our collective anxiety, and there are no good answers.  If so, then the film succeeds as a realistic and scary portrayal of a nightmarish event.  Still, I would have preferred a more satisfying story.",1201392000,,3205,4.724324324324324
1589302,1,B00005JPXY,"I just finished watching this movie at the UA Cinema in Hong Kong.  I left about half way.  My wife stayed.  The entire movie was shot with a camcorder (or envisioned to be) so throughout the entire movie you are watching - constant shaking and upside down images, it was someone walking and running with the camcorder on.  Not a good way to make a movie that anyone would be able to watch without getting sick.  I tried to watch this movie and got sick due to the perceived ""motion"" of the camcorder.  The story is poor and the actors are all novices.  I thought the National Tresures movie I recently watchere in this same Cinema was bad, but this one is much much worse.  Totally lack of story and lack of any conclusions.  I would not recommend anyone with a sound mind to have to sit through this bad movie.  It is not worth 5 cents.",1201392000,12,838,4.280254777070064
1589413,4,B00005JPXY,"Perusing a number of reviews about this film, I've come to realize that a lot of people are giving it three or less stars because they felt that it was ""overhyped.""  However, after watching ""Cloverfield,"" I saw that it met my expectations as a somewhat experimental monster movie.  J.J. Abrams merely planted the seed last year with that brief glimpse of footage from what we would learn to be as Hud's ""documentary"" on the last night that his friend, Rob, would be spending in Manhattan before heading off for Japan.  It was the viewers of said clip who ran with it and created such a stir that a large portion of the population wanted to see this mysterious movie.  That's what you call good advertising in my book.  I praised ""The Blair Witch Project"" for doing the same thing a few years back even though that movie wasn't half as good as ""Cloverfield.""

With that said, ""Cloverfield"" is just what it claims to be:  a monster flick shown from the point of view of a lowly citizen running for his life from a danger he knows very little about.  There is no great leader of the city to protect the people.  There's no young scientist to find a solution to the very big problem.  There's not even a cocksure military leader, just a couple of run-ins with soldiers almost as confused as the primary characters.  Does it work?  Yes.  Are there flaws?  Yes.  That doesn't stop the viewer from enjoying the film, however.

Director Matt Reeves utilizes noise, chaos, uncertainty and pitch black scenery to get into the viewer's head.  On a number of occasions during the film, I caught myself trying to look around the corner of the camera in order to see what was happening.  Viewing the situation through the lens of a digicam makes the viewer seem to be a ""part"" of the action, even though everybody was securely tucked in their seats, most likely stuffing there faces with popcorn (I know I was).  Sure, one could argue that anybody with a little bit of common sense would drop the camera to help their friends, but then again, there wouldn't be much of a movie to watch, would there?

Characters such as the goofy Hud (T.J. Miller), Lily (Jessica Lucas), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), draw genuine sympathy from the crowd as we learn just enough about them to care for them.  Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is likeable, but comes across as a bit selfish when the others are in danger.  Jason Vogel (Hawk) and Odette Yustman (Beth) are excellent in their roles, but aren't part of the primary group as long as the rest of the characters (don't let that revelation make you sure of their demise, either).

Abrams also throws in a couple of twists on the traditional monster movie that weren't touched on in the film's trailers.  When you see them, you'll realize that there's even more to this film than one would think.

Overall, ""Cloverfield"" does deliver on its hype and stealthy ad campaign.  I wonder if some of those who are upset with the film are really upset with themselves for getting pumped up over a movie that never truly revealed enough details before its release to give the viewer any specific expectations.  As stated before, this movie is nothing more than it proclaimed to be in the months prior to its release.  I highly recommend it to fans of monster movies, sci-fi flicks in general, and those who like to see a ""what if"" scenario come to fruition.",1201219200,5,3365,4.610084033613445
1589414,5,B00005JPXY,"The real goal of any movie worth its salt is to draw us head-first into a reality that is not our own.  To help us inhabit new places, sometimes fantastic, sometimes harsh and gritty, but always powerful.  Stories are really beside the point.  So are easy answers and resolutions.  No movie that has ever made a truly lasting impression on anyone did so solely because it had a cool plot or a nifty twist at the end.  There's always something more there; something that makes you lose yourself for a moment and become someone else, somewhere else.

The world has grown so jaded, and people so skeptical, that this isn't easy to do.  J.J. Abrams, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B000P6YNSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alias/dp/B000H5V8D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alias</a>&nbsp;fame, is a man with weird and wonderful ideas, and he has created in ""Cloverfield"" a movie that isn't deep or profound, but which resonates with powerful humanity, which ripples with very believable terror.  I haven't felt this enraptured and excited by a film since I was thirteen years old, back when I didn't care so much how meaningful and thoughtful a movie was, as long as it managed to grab me without letting go.

I will say this right now: shame on you if you whine about the shaky camera work.  Boo to you if you moan about the lack of a plot.  And go soak your head if you complain about the frustrating lack of clear images or action scenes.  By now, you should already know that this flick is filmed documentary-style, through the lens of a single camera carried by one very confused and harried citizen of New York as that city undergoes attack from some unknown thing or things.  Those of you with tender tummies and a susceptibility to vertigo should stay away.

Too bad for you, because you're missing one hell of a ride.  Universal Studios makes millions out of roller coasters designed to make us feel like we're in a movie.  Reality television shows have spent years pretending to showcase real people at their worst and best.  ""Cloverfield"" bypasses all of that with the most gorgeous ease, seducing you into a young man's going away party (he's leaving on the morrow to work in Japan, a clever nod to the Godzilla inspiration this movie banks on and surpasses), and then completely knocking the socks off of you with a series of horrific moments that are captured in the queasy, quake-y quaver of a handheld camera.

It's a monster movie, first and foremost, but it's done in true J.J. Abrams style, with a flippant attitude toward anything but the common sense and scalding fear of the characters who are holding the camera.  There may be some who might harp about how unlikely it is that a single man would videotape the systematic destruction of New York for seven straight hours while his life is on the line; in a world where every cell phone has a camera and most people are dying for their chance to be in the frame, where news reporters place themselves on the frontlines of major wars just to catch a scoop, where websites like Youtube fester with millions of snippets of people being everything from goofy to grotesque, I say the movie rings quite true.  Besides, I say again, it's a monster movie.

Like no monster movie I can recall seeing, ""Cloverfield"" provides what they all wish they could: the fear of really and truly being there.  The panicked confusion.  The hasty shock and dust-soaked amazement.  Monster movies of yore have tried to scare us silly by giving us the horrific grand view of things, when few besides superheroes and dictators ever experience life with the grand scheme of things in mind.  We are individuals, with our precious loves and single lives, and when New York rumbles with fireballs and fear, what really scares us is the threat to us and our loved ones.

""Cloverfield"" sidesteps the grandiose issues of military might or radioactive origins.  It doesn't give us harried politicians wondering what's to be done.  It even pointedly avoids discussions of longterm, worldwide impacts.  ""What is that?"" one of the characters screams.  The cameraman, in one of the movie's best lines, dismisses the question by simply saying, ""It's a terrible thing.""

Terrible it is.  Let the movie hold your hand, and it will usher you into that powerfully personal wonder and horror that so many of us forget can still exist.  Viewing this movie, I got sick, I was disoriented, I squinted to see through the fuzzy frames and the agonizingly distorted camera work.  It was hard to watch.

I would turn around and watch it again in a second.  And I'd probably love it just as much.",1201219200,21,4752,4.970886075949367
1589415,5,B00005JPXY,"There are many things being said about Cloverfield and most of them are good.  I don't want to retread many of the points other people have made, but because I saw this last night and absolutely loved it I'm probably going to cover some things that have already been said.  Suffice to say, Cloverfield, along with perhaps the South Korean monster movie gem&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Host/dp/B000PKG8TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Host</a>, is without a doubt the best monster movie to come a long in a very long time.

It had reached that degree of horror and suspense for me but time will tell.

Cloverfield is intentionally framed in a very unique way.  The audience becomes aware that what they are watching is supposed to be real recovered footage taken on the film's main character's camera.  His name is Rob Hawkins and some of the earlier footage on the camera shows him with his girlfriend Beth.  The more recent footage shows a surprise going-away party in Manhattan that Rob's friends and his brother Jason threw for him after he got a promotion. He is ultimately relocating to Japan.  We find that Rob is no longer with his girlfriend at the time of the party, and just as Rob's friend Hud (the guy filming most of Cloverfield) and his brother talk him into patching things up with Beth, something goes very wrong in Manhattan.  What happens after we meet these people, and maybe even begin to care about them for 84 minutes, is where the horror begins. I'm not going to say anything else about the film, because it is entirely worth seeing without knowing anymore than I have already revealed.

The comparison's to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/William-Castle/dp/B00000K3U3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">William Castle</a>-like marketing gimmicks of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;a decade ago are fair comparisons in many respects, but given that movie's long-term unpopularity I think it is important to step in and acknowledge that Cloverfield is far different in many ways as well.  I firmly believe it will have great longevity.  It uses this sort of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cannibal-Holocaust/dp/B000C4BBXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cannibal Holocaust</a>/Blair Witch Project style not as a way to market it to us as if it is real, but to merely place a monster movie in as realistic a frame as possible.  For that, it does work.  I don't think great acting was as necessary here for me because I wanted to believe it was real, so some of the acting that may have been bad was forgivable enough to forget.  Although, Lizzy Caplan who played one of the main characters Marlena was actually very good.  Call me a thrill-seeking cinephile searching hard for a scare, but I wanted to buy into Cloverfield and I was sold to it very quickly and very easily.  No reason to be cynical when all I came to see was a fun monster movie.  It is more than fair to say I got what I wanted.

Many critics are also mentioning the parallels with the attacks on 9/11.  I think it was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ebert/dp/0740771795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ebert</a>&nbsp;who said the film ""evokes"" 9/11 and that is right on point.  It does evoke feelings during those attacks and I'm not sure if Cloverfield would have been filmed the same way without it.  For many young American's the only similar large scale tragedy we have seen was thru the lense of a news camera on the day of those attacks, and Cloverfield uses that effectively to force us to empathize with a city under attack by a gargantuan monster.  In Cloverfield we get the news coverage, the exploding buildings, the frantic behavior in not knowing what is happening and what could happen next, the poisonous dust from collapsed buildings filling the streets, and perhaps most iconic of all was the destruction of another New York landmark, the Statue of Liberty, which is handled by this monster in the exact same way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/0783241895/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>&nbsp;handled Thulsa Doom.

So there is more than one way to put this monster movie formula into a convincing paradigm and the makers of Cloverfield are quite resourceful in doing so.  The film also somehow managed to tell a nice little story.  There was a lot happening in Cloverfield and certainly more than enough to keep you very entertained for an hour and a half.  It was a great cinematic experience and I offer my highest recommendation.",1201219200,8,5127,5.781914893617022

1589417,4,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield (Matt Reeves, 2008)

The main reason that Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying, besides being the first January-horror-film release in recent memory that's actually good, is that it does exactly what it sets out to do-- entertain. Sure, there may be better movies out now (or, if you don't live in ""limited areas"", will be better movies out in the near future), but Cloverfield isn't trying to be a No Country for Old Men or There Will Be Blood-- it wants to be a fifties monster movie fifty years on, and it does so in great, glorious detail. It's a movie that's short (eighty-four minutes), sweet, and, after an overly long piece of setup, to the point. It wants to make you laugh, it wants to make you jump, and in a few scenes it wants to make you cringe, and it accomplishes all of these things without any deep, reflective moments or other stuff that so often seems out of place in a horror film. (Think about, since the comparisons are coming thick and fast, Heather's monologue on the rock five or ten minutes into The Blair Witch Project. None of that sort of malarkey here.) In some ways, there's a better comparison to be made to, say, ""The Most Dangerous Game"" than to The Blair Witch Project here.

The secondary reason that Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying is that TV director Matt Reeves got around the need to figure out how to make the small screen-big screen transition by taking a relatively original idea-- having the entire film told from the perspective of a video camera (and yes, it is the entire film, going The Blair Witch Project three or four better)-- and filtering his story through it. When your whole movie comes through the lens of a handheld video camera, you can pretty much blow off all the differences between small-screen and big-screen directing. This is normally the place in the review where I'd start complaining about the technical details. You're not going to get any of that here; the handheld-video-camera angle throws them all away. I will file something like a reverse complaint, however; the sound mix in this movie, which is one of the reasons you must go see it on the big screen, is way too good for a handheld production. Reeves may have nabbed his video ideas from The Blair Witch Project, but the sound mix is straight outta Doom3, and it's awesome. The other big point in the handheld-video-camera approach's favor is that there is no third-person-omniscient here, so all we know is what the characters know. I've heard at least two reviewers complaining about this. I don't understand why, because usually we're all complaining about the exact opposite. We only know what they know, and that's the reason this film is so effective; while, yeah, there is one big-reveal scene towards the end, I'm willing to forgive it given that the big-reveal scene in most monster movies since the special effects budget started outstripping the promotional budget in Hollywood monster movies is ""the last half of the movie"". We actually see very little of the nemeses in this movie, and that's one of the big, big points in its favor, for reasons I'll get into a much greater detail below. Besides, the structure forces Reeves to focus on the idea that a monster movie should be about the humans, rather than the monsters. It's a beautiful sight to see.

The tertiary reason-- reasons, I should say-- Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying is that despite my assertion at the beginning of this review that the film's entire goal is to entertain, there's so very, very much more going on under the surface here. The trick is that you don't need to consciously grasp any of this stuff to enjoy the flick; you can just look at it as a monster movie and it will still be fun. The rest is just gravy. In this case, the first thing to address is the obvious comparison everyone's making (and interpreting differently)-- what's the movie saying about the Most Overrated Event in Human History(TM)? I'm going to offer a perspective I haven't seen yet, and one I hope is more welcome than the others-- that the ability of a filmmaker to destroy New York City in a movie, and the ability of movie fans to enjoy watching New York City be destroyed, is a sign that we're all starting to get over the obsession and get on with our lives. After all, monsters have been destroying cities in movies for decades, and movie fans have been loving it. The second one that really struck me was that Reeves took a relatively unknown stable of (mostly) TV character actors and made them into serious star material; the characters' actions and reactions here never feel fake or forced. The third is that there's a confusion factor here that there shouldn't be, given that we're supposedly seeing objective evidence captured on a video camera. Some will use (and, no doubt, some have used) this to trash the movie; I see it as something entirely different. As I said before, we know only what the characters do; there are very few points, however, where the characters aren't questioning the evidence of their own senses. Why shouldn't the viewer, as well? A lot of the things that don't quite add up are stuff you wouldn't really think about much consciously (like, how big is the main bad guy, anyway?), and they're anchored by a relatively solid grounding-- the geography of midtown Manhattan, which is concrete and unassailable. Now, I'm not entirely sure, since I'm not Matt Reeves or scriptwriter Drew Goddard, but I think this was intentional, and it's great.

In short, the first major film event of 2008 turns out to be a monster movie. How cool is that? ****",1201046400,,5606,4.7115188583078496
1589418,3,B00005JPXY,"Last night, my gym buddy, feeling rather restless towards the evening, invited me to join him in movie watching.

I recall having watched a fascinating teaser trailer of a sci-fi action movie, named 'Cloverfield' on cable television, where the Statute of Liberty had its concrete head blown off.

So, we headed down to the Jurong Entertainment Centre together to watch the movie.

The movie did not start off even with the movie title or the names of principal actors & actresses from the opening scene.
All we could see at the very beginning segment was a quick flash-by placard showing 'Bad Robot', followed by captioned scenes of the Central Park in New York.

There were some muddled messages about a video footage & the US Department of Defence.

All this while, the movie had continuously very jerky & erratic images, as if we were watching a cheapskate home-made movie from a hand-held camcorder.

All I could figure out was this scenario:

A young guy, Hud, was apparently assigned to take some live video clips of a sending-off party for his best friend, Rob, who would be going off to Tokyo soon. Some of the party goers were given the opportunity to say something nice about Rob. The setting was Lower Manhattan, New York.

His girl friend, Beth, suddenly appeared with another guy. There was a quarrel, & Beth left abruptly. In between, the camcorder went into rewind mode, where we could see fleeting images of Rob having a good time with Beth.

Sometimes, we could see Hud focusing the camcorder on a beautiful damsel, who somehow fascinated him during the filming.

All these captured as well rewinded images went on for some fifteen or twenty minutes.

Actually, I was about to stand up & go down to the management office to give them a piece of my mind, thinking that their guy in the projector room probably screwed up something.

Then, came some sort of a thundering earthquake, which apparently rocked the whole building, where the party was held. Naturally, I stayed back in my seat.

Frightened, & puzzled, all the party goers went down to the streets. In the next moment, some tall buildings started to crash down. Sad images of the terrorist strike on the World Trade Centre flashed through my mind, as I watched the crumbling of skyscrapers.

Strangely, our friend, Hud, continued to capture everything happening around him on his camcorder, while his close friends were desperately struggling to understand what was going on.

For some split seconds, the camcorder actually captured fleeting images of something live, but definitely gargantuan, moving about in the background. What the hell was that, I was thinking. I was sure all those guys out there felt the same.

The next scene was rather chilling, with the dislodged concrete head of the Statute of Liberty suddenly crashing & rolling on to the streets.

Suddenly, amidst the chaos, everybody started to run &/or hide in a nearby supermarket. The streets were ripped apart. Worst still, the Brooklyn Bridge was eventually demolished by 'something out there'.

The movie continued with the four or five original party goers on the run from 'something out there'.

Hud, seemingly dedicated to his assignment, continued to capture every running &/or escape scene on film. He was adamant, as he felt that 'people gonna want to know . . . & how it all went down'.

The next few scenes showed some soldiers appearing on the scene, with tank support, & battling the gargantuan creature lurking in the background of tall buildings.

Then, Rob suddenly received a phone call from Beth. She was in trouble & needed his help, but her location was right inside the danger zone. Rob decided to back trek, to commence a frenzied search for her, against the wishes of his friends. For some strange reasons, the friends decided to tag along. They then moved precariously through the darkened subway tunnel, with rats running around, to reach Beth's location.

Along the way, they encountered some fast-moving spider-like creatures in the underground.

One of the lady friends got bitten quite badly.

They finally reached the tall building where Beth was located. They went up to one of the top floors on foot, as the lifts were out of order. Rob eventually found Beth. Together with Hud, who continued to lug around with his camcorder, & another lady friend, they scrambled down the building very quickly to reach a helicopter pick-up point, as arranged earlier with the rescuing soldiers.

Luckily, they made it to the two rescuing helicopters. From the hovering helicopters, they could see that the gargantuan creature was being blasted with bombs from military aircrafts.

Unfortunately, that damned creature was still alive.

All I could see subsequently was that one of the helicopters was chewed up by that monster. It then crashed into a grass patch, probably near Central Park. There were many dark images that followed, which I could not make sense of at all. Next, I could see the dark image of Hud's dead body, apparently with a twisted neck.

Then, the whole movie just ended there & then, with credit titles starting to come up on screen.

We walked out of the movie theatre, more dazed & lost than disappointed.

Throughout the ninety minutes of movie time, the Godzilla-like monster was not actually seen in its entirety, only being viewed from different angles, as if the audience was supposed to piece everything together. Along with the monster, there were snippets of those little creepy spider-like monsters running around.

The whole movie was quite disorienting. I still could not figure out what was all about. There were too many unanswered questions. There wasn't any proper closure.

Acting-wise, all the actors & actresses were practically unknown, as far as my gym buddy & I are concerned.

The cinematography, with all the jerky & erratic images from start to finish, was horrendous, to say the least.

Come to think of it, there wasn't any music in the background, only ambient sounds such as creeks & thumps.

Sometimes, I felt that the dialogue between the characters really drove me bonkers, e.g. ""Oh, My God, you know Superman, too? Geez, I'm feeling the connection . . . Have you heard of Garfield?""

Until now, I still couldn't figure out the connection of the movie title, 'Cloverfield' with the theme or story plot of the movie.

Surprisingly, this movie was a J J Abrams project, the same brains behind the 'Lost' & 'Alias' TV suspense series. A lot of viewers raved about them. To be frank, I hardly watch the two series, as I generally don't like to waste my time following story sequence week after week.

All I can say is this. Human beings still possess redeeming values. Despite personal risks, as well as seemingly insurmountable odds, we sometimes will go all out to help our loved ones &/or other fellow beings in the pursuit of survival. Maybe, that's the principal message of the movie. I really don't know.

On hindsight, I should have told my gym buddy to go & watch 'American Gangster', starring Denzel Washington & Russell Crowe.",1201046400,4,7051,4.873534338358459
1589419,4,B00005JPXY,"It's already a clich&eacute; to call CLOVERFIELD the ""Blair Witch Meets Godzilla"" movie.  But that's about as accurate a snapshot of this film as you could want.  The entire experience is seen through the point of view of one guy who starts out by filming his friend's going-away party and becomes his video of the attack on Manhattan by a Godzilla-like monster.

This method accomplished several crucial things:

1) It allows the movie's very low budget to get stretched even further and in fact, makes the low budget a non-issue.  Everything looks a little grainy in this film...and if the filmmaker's can't afford to SHOW you something, you can just HEAR it.
2) It injects a new life into a tired genre.
3) It actually becomes a little poignant, because occasionally the film fast-forwards and we see snippets of the video that was on this particular tape BEFORE this monster video was taped.  These snippets show the early days of the love story between two key characters.  The way CLOVERFIELD is made allows these scenes to be integrated in a completely organic way.
4) It creates a ""you are there"" feeling that makes the film work...much in the way this method made BLAIR WITCH work.

The story itself is nothing new.  Big monster attacks big city.  Mass destruction ensues.  The military is ineffective.  Many people get squished.  But what creator J.J. Abrams has managed to do is find a new way of telling the story that makes it seem at least a little fresh AND makes it almost real time and quite visceral.  You are ""on the ground"" as events unfold.  Just like the main characters, you get NO information on where this thing came from, what might be happening anywhere else in the city or the world, etc.  The movie doesn't have to answer any questions, because the videographer of the movie wouldn't have gotten any answers either.

It's fast-paced, funny at times and absolutely scary at times.  You'll jump more than once and you'll have a good time.  Your brain will be engaged for a minimal amount of time...you see this film at a gut level.  In terms of accomplishing what it set out to do, CLOVERFIELD gets close to knocking it out of the park.

There are weaknesses, of course.  The film is very short (less than 90 minutes) and even then, the opening scenes at the party feel like padding.  Yes, we get to meet the characters who become central to the rest of the film...but watching a bunch of strangers partying is about as exciting as it would be to see a home movie of a friend's party.  Also, the actors are mostly unknown, and they aren't the greatest.  No one gives a true stinker of a performance but neither is there much above average.  (The one exception is Lizzy Caplan [best known for MEAN GIRLS], who gives a little depth to her role.)

Finally, my biggest problem with the low-budget was that Manhattan wasn't crowded enough.  If something like this happened, the streets would be absolutely choked with people.  But the crowd scenes make it seem as though the city has been mostly abandoned already.  You just have to go with it.

So CLOVERFIELD is solid, exciting entertainment.  It won't be a classic, but it does rise above its genre trappings through its inventive setup and a few truly jolting scenes.

This film had a gimmick for itself beginning with the magazine poster art we saw last year, in the Entertainment Weekly magazine, of the beheaded Statue of Liberty and New York City being ripped into.

  By the way, if you see ""Cloverfield"" in a movie theater right now, you will see a teaser for STAR TREK with the voice of Leonard Nimoy.

It is not Godzilla.
  No pictures were released of the monster, creating the curiosity that you would have to see the movie to satisfy your itch.
  The Cinemark theater I went to posted a warning that this film was shot with the hand-held camera technique (a la the college experiment film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>) and that the shaky motion of this film might make you sick.
  I was just fine when I saw the film, but I really did not care for the jittery hand-held camcorder technique.  While it does create the illusion that you are right there with the group of five friends, you never really get a good still look at the monster as the camera keeps moving.
  This film would have been much better if it were filmed in the normal way.
  The film begins with a surprise party for one of the guys who will be leaving to go to Japan. This hand-held camera thing really goes on too long at this point to really enjoy the film, but when some of the people go outside for a while, the action begins. It does scare you a little bit.
  We  follow the 5 young adults (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, Lizzy Caplan, T.J. Miller [who holds the camcorder], Mike Vogel) as they run through Manhattan in terror and fright.
  The film only runs at 84 minutes.

Use the technique of ""Blair Witch"", throw in a dash of ""Alien"" and a big heaping footprint of ""Godzilla"" and you've got ""Cloverfield"" which clocks in at a brief but intense 84 minutes. J.J. Abrams and his collaborators writer Drew Goodard (a writing alum of Abrams' ""Lost"" and ""Alias"") & Matt Reeves (another long time Abrams collegue who also shot ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" as well as episodes of ""Lost"")put together a wild ride of a monster movie recalling ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" and, more importantly, ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" with its focus on a famous city terrorized by a larger than life creature.

WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!

The film is told from the point of view of Hud who is documenting his best friend Rob's going away party. It seems that Rob is the new VP for a company in Japan and the big celebration put on by his brother Jason and his girlfriend. Rob has a blow out with best friend and long-time crush Lei. Then all heck breaks loose as the Creature begins tearing apart Manhattan and bowling with the head of the Statue of Liberty.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Cloverfield"" looks quite good on DVD. While this single disc edition doesn't have as many extras as I had expected (Best Buy has a bonus disc with a 24 minute behind-the-scenes featurette composed of, naturally enough, camcorder footage!). We get an audio commentary track from the director (he discusses how Abrams was inspired to create ""Cloverfield"" after going to Japan and seeing a store full of Godzilla toys. He though we deserved our own giant lizard, too), outtakes, deleted scenes, a pair of not-so-different alternate endings AND an amusing Easter Egg.

""Cloverfield"" isn't a deep film and isn't meant to be. While it does make reference to 9/11 because of the stark images of destruction and our knowledge of that event (as well as the characters reaction to what is occuring around them), ""Cloverfield"" doesn't take that analogy too seriously instead focusing on scaring and startling us. Still, the Creature as terrorist (when is a terrorist NOT a monster?)provides us a window into a world rocked by destruction and a glimpse into the sometimes brave sometimes idiotic reaction of human beings in a crisis situation.

The characters are pretty well drawn considering that our only knowledge of them comes from what we see via the camcorder (including footage that survived being taped over--a very clever way to give us a backstory on the main couple)but the technique means that there are limitations--we know only what the group of characters we are stuck with know becoming part of their group via the camcorder and Hud's occasionally insightful and idiotic musings.

""Cloverfield"" will never be ""The Godfather"" but it's a very good film within a genre that has varied from the idiotic (""The Giant Gila Monster"") to the exceptional (pick any of the ground breaking monster-on-the-loose movies you'd like)and it is an enjoyable ride. If it is the cinematic version of junk food, it's extremely tasty and enjoyable junk food. Could it have been improved? Sure--we could have had better acting, character development, background which the director could have introduced in the same format as the other stuff but for its limited scope and ambitions its a fine film (that's even comparing it to Abrams' other film projects from ""Regarding Henry"" to ""MI:3"" or ""Lost"").

""Cloverfield"" takes the film as amusement park ride one step further than many others have with its jittery camera work and ""you are there"" approach to documenting the destruction of ""Manhattan"". We see just enough to fear for our heroes and just enough to be thankful it isn't real. ""Cloverfield"" isn't a great film but it is a great deal of fun.",1200960000,2,3869,4.887195121951219
1589422,4,B00005JPXY,"WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD

Anyone who says that there is no Hell should visit the place I grew up, southern Georgia, in the month of August.  Aside from the oppressive heat,  some things I remember vividly are the fire ant mounds that would infest our property.  One of my chores as a teenager was to break them up and pour poison into them.

I occasionally wondered how the tiny creatures felt as they watched a giant invader, huge beyond their comprehension, destroying their carefully built tunnels and raining death down on them.

Not that they didn't fight back; they launched waves of their best warriors against me.  But their poisonous bites were to me nothing more than irritating stings, and I was all the more gleeful in my annihilation of them because of the minor pain they caused me.

I now know how the little devils felt.

Cloverfield is a film about a young, hip group of Manhattanites whose world is demolished by a monster that lumbers beside skyscrapers, almost matching many of them in height.  We learn little about this beast, other than it's very big, very tough, and very, very pissed.  The military tosses tons of conventional firepower against it, but it just keeps coming.  In fact, in one scene that must have been a nod to Godzilla, we see the creature's foot step on a tank, crushing it like a tin can.

Making the situation worse are a horde of smaller critters, about the size of large dogs, that have invaded the city as well.  Watch out, don't let them bite!  As one character found out, the results can be explosive.

I won't give any major plot details, but be warned: things don't end happy
for our friends, who are recording all of this on their trusty camcorder.
Also, the question of whether the monster is ultimately slain or not remains open, as do queries about its origin and nature.  Like so many of life's tragedies (car crashes, cancer, etc.) the beast comes without reason, without mercy, and without escape.

I think this is one reason for the movie's popularity: it taps into the fears we all have that terrible events will unravel the fragile security of our lives and rob us of all we hold precious and sacred.

The utter lack of resolution is the reason I dinged the film one star.  This movie cries out for a sequel, or at least some explanations from its creators.  In the absence of certainty speculation abounds, however, and I offer some below for interested parties:

During the movie Hud mentions the possibility that the monster came from an ocean trench, and I think this a strong possibility.  It did, after all, rise from the sea.

Also, its extremely tough hide and near-invulnerability to bombs and bullets could be due to its having to withstand the tremendous pressures it would deal with on the ocean's bottom.

It obviously breathes air, indicating it probably uses some gill/lung double system.  It also suggests that the military would have been better off forgetting the tanks, bombs, etc. and just nerve-gassing it.

The mini-monsters that plague the city were, in my opinion, the giant's equivalent of lice, hair mites, etc.  Just as we have tiny bugs that hitch a ride with us in our follicles, lashes, skin, etc., so does it.  My good wife suggested the possibility that they were the critter's offspring, dropped across the city so they could grow up to be just like mom.  Now that's a scary thought.

End of speculation.  But I do have one more thing to say.  I had no trouble watching this movie, and I hate roller coasters.  The remarks about its jerky quality were, to me, vastly overblown.  It does come across as something shot by a terrified amateur film maker who is fleeing for his life, but, hey, that's exactly what it's supposed to be, so what's the problem?

Highly recommended for horror, monster and SF fans - or anyone who likes a good scare.",1200960000,3,3841,4.663690476190476
1589463,5,B00005JPXY,"So of course everyone is aware of this movie due to the mysterious advertisments that surrounded it months before the name was even revealed... So the question began, ""Can it ever live up to the hype?""  so two nights ago (the day after it was released) I went and found out that, yes, it absolutely could.  Now I won't say anything negative to those who hated it or thought it was merely 'so-so' because no movie will ever be loved by every single human being, but I will say why I loved the hell out of it.

1) I love how it was set up to be a story about people living through a monter invasion and not the actual monster itself.  No, you never get told what the monster is, no you never find out where it came from, no you don't see much of the monster throughout the movie.  BUT! You never find out what it is and where it came from because the characters never do, and you don't see much of it in the movie because the characters don't see much of it (due to running for their lives) but don't worry, cause nobody will leave the movie and wonder ""What exactly did the monster look like?""

2) I love how they took a totally crappy, lame plot (basically a love story about one guy loving a girl but never telling her who then decides to go into a deserted city with a HUGE creature on the lose to rescue her) and set it in these wonderfly suspensful situations that actually make it acceptable. Sit through the ten minutes of story setup and noisy partying and BOOM! (literally) the action kicks off with a bang. After that it's a truely suspenseful tale of a group of kids running from an unknown creature big enough to use Miss Libery's head like a football.  And also, it's not just the massive beast they have to fear, cause it didn't come alone.

3) I love the scene where they decide to travel through the subway tunnels, through the pitch dark with nothing but a whimpy camera light. I actually think this whole scene is what made me love the movie so much. The way the writers wrote the dialouge and the actors acted, you can just so clearly feel them go from scared to terrified even without the presence of the monster. There's also a very humorous conversation between the camerman and his love interest about Superman and Garfield.

4)I love that this movie gets away with being just slightly over an hour long, maybe 75 mins. I hate movies that can't pull enough story together to atleast fill a 2 hour movie.  Cloverfield is the one, and possibly only, exception. I can't of anything that could've been added on for more time, honestly. It's a short, exciting, run for you life film and it's perfect that way.

So I guess I'll wrap it up by saying Give the movie a chance, and if it's possible go see it on the big screen cause I think it's gonna lose some of it's 'magic' on a regular television. It's short, it gives zero answers to all the important questions, it has no underlying story or overall message, what the camera shows does leave alot to the imagination, but it is entertaining enough to pull it all off. I really think it deserves these five stars...",1200960000,,3082,4.342608695652174

There's not always a ready answer to things that happen.  And often the answer we are given is not the truth.

Something evil and horrible is afoot and it is awesome in its destructive power and relentless in its anger.

The main thing is to live long enough so you can figure out what's going on and how to respond.

It's interesting that in the movie, the official government answer is the ""Hammer Down"" policy that isolates, seals and ""writes off"" Manhattan.  And so the terrorists win.  Now that's really scary. But that's just Act I.

This terrific little monster movie demands a second and third act.

1589466,3,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is about equal parts 9/11, ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", with the latter providing the technical model, the center film providing the manifest content, and 9/11 providing the questions that are put forward and left unanswered by the film.

If you haven't heard, ""Cloverfield"" is the story of a group of 20-something Manhattanites whose late night party is spoiled by the arrival of a monster in New York that goes around killing people, knocking over tall buildings, collapsing bridges and wrecking things a la Godzilla.

The production is cleverly modeled after Blair Witch Project, with the entire 90 minutes of goings on filmed by a hand held camera. The computer-generated scenes of monsters, wreckage and the headless Statue of Liberty (check out the scene that comes up with this title) are all done very well. I doubt they took the computer-generated scenes then filmed them a second time with a moving camera to get the ship on the rolling seas affect; it was compelling however completed.

The narrative story is full of exciting moments, one of which -- a moment where the hero has saved a damsel in distress and escapes midst up close warfare between the giant and the military -- left my heart pounding and my breathing accelerated when quiet returned in the theatre. The sound effects also work to the advantage of this actioner, which won't be very cogent when you see it on your television unless you have a screen at least 60 inches across.

The storyline, as we know from films just like this one made half a century ago, isn't about an actual monster; it's about the war on terror. Just like the dinosaur that invaded New York in the 1953 sci-fi classic, ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" -- which was a metaphor for communism -- the monster that invades New York this time is the reincarnation of the 9/11 terrorists come for a return visit.

That beast from the 1950s was killed by the military and we were all saved from the ravages of communism. Here, the outcome is less clear. Because of the way the story is told, it is clear in the filmmakers mind that terrorists are winning this war, or at least making a dent in our way of life. Because of the way the movie ends, it is unclear if they think we (members of the good old U.S.A.) are making headway against our 21st century worldwide adversary.

Even without the metaphor, ""Cloverfield"" is an exciting afternoon at the theatre and, for people prone to seasickness, a wild and dizzying ride. If you choose to see this film, and discount the supplementary metaphor, this movie won't make much sense and will leave you frustrated. When you put all the parts together, you'll see it's a contemporary story told pretty well in the clothes worn a half-century in our past.",1200873600,31,2767,4.730290456431535
1589467,5,B00005JPXY,"In spite of my anxiety over its months-long hyping, I found that ""Cloverfield"" met and exceeded my expectations. The film kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. My stomach was so tight that I had lost any interest in eating after the film. Or maybe that was the extreme ""video-verite"" shaky camera handling.

""Cloverfield"" follows a group of successful 20-something New Yorkers, whose celebration of the imminent departure of one of their number is interrupted by the arrival of a horrific, building-bashing monster. The conceit of the film is that is was recorded by a group of five people who split off from the party. Following some Gen-Y (""Y"" for YouTube) impulse to record everything, they drag their camera along through military counterattack, destroyed buildings and over-the-top mayhem. The medium gives the film a gritty man-in-the-street feel, and also gives the filmmakers a perfect rationale for not telling us where the monster comes from and what it wants -- we know only as much as the film's participants can see.

But the film also has other strands and layers, which take it a notch above other monster films. The film is imagined in layers - we are movie viewers in a theater, watching a film located and studied by the military, which was shot by a group of New Yorkers, which itself was recorded over another (and important) piece of tape. The filmmakers carefully attended to the complicated layers of human relationships, which in a few visual strokes early on, built up a surprising amount of emotional complexity. Smart, serious, hunky Rob is crazy for gentle, gorgeous Beth, but is distraught that she attends the party with a new beau. Goofy, loyal Hud is nutty about snide/reclusive Marlene, who gives him as much attention as she would a 6-foot tall cockroach. Rob's bro Jason is madly in love with Lily. Each is played by a newcomer, so there's no star power to distract from the thesis that Bad Things Will Happen To Ordinary Well-off Young People. The whole going-away party episode may seem stuck on to some, but it is integral to the relationships that develop between the characters throughout the film.

The film's effects were eye popping and very in-your-face: buildings collapse, bridges are wrecked and cars are stomped aplenty. The army has its hands full, and more. The monster, especially in the film's first half, is seen only in snippets. As with any monster movie, the less seen of the beast the better, and when we do get a fuller view, it's a bit of a letdown. But through all the carnage and devastation (Manhattan gets TRASHED!) the characters' initial (and realistic) shock and confusion gives way to a simple, logical yet foolhardy rescue attempt.

Maybe because of their anonymity, the actors were able to meld into a realistic group, rather than fighting for star standing. And thanks to the excellent writing and directing, the characters were recognizable types. Though I hardly knew the characters, I nearly wept when one lost his life. And I laughed as Hud, Rob's boisterous and randy best friend, spent time running at the mouth or (between horrifying escapes from the monster) hitting on hard-to-get Marlene. These touches gave the viewer a delicious sense of the complexities brewing even in the most terrified of brains.

The 9/11 links were understated, but omnipresent. So much so that some viewers might wonder if ""Cloverfield"" was a subtle allegory of that attack and the military response to it. Nevertheless, the parallels were sometimes unnerving -- an unexpected danger shocks an unprepared city; paper floats from damaged buildings; a skyscraper collapses and sends dust clouds into the street; evacuees clog bridges; the city canyon's walls echo the wailing sirens of emergency vehicles. If they meant nothing by the parallel, the filmmakers at least mined the store of commonly-held images of that day.

""Cloverfield"" had a few plot holes and implausibilities--horrific injuries do little to slow down important characters?. But the film maintained its consistency throughout, and never found really stupid reasons to keep the camera rolling. For a great film about the way a group of unprepared, ordinary people react to a vicious and implacable threat, ""Cloverfield"" has few equals. A great time and a smartly-done film.",1200873600,,4300,5.032303370786517
1589468,2,B00005JPXY,"Just one minute after this movie started, my stomach started to drop. I thought, NO, please God, don't let this be a Blair Witch one-camera movie!  But so it was. For nearly an hour, you're forced to watch the totally amateur cam recorder operator film the ceiling, the floor, the ground, never getting anyone in focus. When he does, the camera shakes and revolves and tilts until I nearly barfed. You'd think that at least for a movie, J.j. Abrams could have created a fairly experienced cam recorder operator character? Just as bad,you're forced to sit through more than 20 minutes at the beginning of a party in some very boring party in NYC and several of the no-name cast members talk into the camera. And when the hero of the movie is determined to save his girlfriend in the mddle of Manhattan, you're forced to follow the camera up 65 floors in a destroyed building before you finally find the love interest. About the only dialogue I could make out was the non-ending ""My God! My God! My God!"" The monster was cool looking but you wish you could have seen more of it. And now let's take up a collection for J.J. Abrams to hire a professional cameraman and crew for his next project.",1200873600,15,1191,4.513888888888889
1589469,3,B00005JPXY,"With the advance buildup that ""Cloverfield"" received, the unveiling of the actual product was bound to leave some, if not most, viewers feeling cheated or disappointed to some degree.  For months (it seemed) the trailer teased and tantalized with thrilling, often incomprehensible, images of chaos and destruction in Manhattan, as frantic, attractive twenty-somethings scurried for their lives amidst fiery explosions and the indelible image of the Statue of Liberty's head crashing and rolling to a stop near terrified onlookers.

Utilizing the conceit that the entire adventure is caught on a partygoer's camcorder, ""Cloverfield"" immediately conjures up memories of the ""The Blair Witch Project"", that late nineties megahit that seemed to polarize viewers into ""love it"" or ""hate it"" camps.  I liked ""Blair Witch"", although the concept of the student's terrifying journey being captured via their own video cameras was stretched very thin at times, particularly during the meltdown scenes, and those scenes when the students appeared to be in mortal danger.  However, the young people in ""Blair Witch"" were film students so it was possible to go along with the idea of their incessant filming.  With ""Cloverfield"" it's not that simple.  The protagonists here are not apparently film students but regular, young New Yorkers throwing a surprise party for one of their own, a golden boy named Rob, who has accepted a job in Japan.  Since Rob is leaving the next morning, the girlfriend of Rob's brother insists that the entire evening be captured on camera for Rob to savor in the weeks to come.  As everyone now knows, the party is seriously interrupted by something that is big and mean and clearly unhappy.  Lower Manhattan is ripped apart, the Brooklyn Bridge is demolished, Miss Liberty is decapitated, and romances are tested, friends die--and hardly a moment is left unfilmed.  Hud, the assigned cameraman, and Rob's best friend dutifully records every single moment, even as he is running down flights of stairs, jumping from one collapsing building to another, being attacked by some really icky spiderlike entities in a subway tunnel--it just doesn't work.  The only way to make this believable would be for Hud to have the camcorder strapped to his head, but that isn't the case.  I really didn't mind the fast, jerky movements of the camera--for me, it added a sense of urgency and excitement to the film. Most of all, it added much needed intimacy to these characters' plight, since we are seeing this crisis through their eyes, specifically through the eyes of Hud. However, even this does not do much to endear the characters to the viewer.  Actually, I found them to be somewhat uninvolving, at best, and irritating, at worst.  I was especially irritated that Rob would allow his good friends to traipse all the way to 59th Street from downtown with the beast from hell (and his minions) hot on their tail while Rob tries to rescue his almost-girlfriend from another unknown peril.  I was also irritated at the really stupid decisions that these characters continually make throughout the film.  Most of all, I was irritated because I really wanted to like this film and, while it isn't awful, it could have been so much better.  It's sort of like ""Friends"" meets ""Godzilla"", without the character development of either. That's not the fault of the pretty, but little known, actors--they do the best that they can with a lame and predictable script.  The special effects were good, and sometimes even great.  The few glimpses we get of the monster are effectively creepy, but the truly chilling creatures are the aforementioned spidery things which are, apparently, parasites that have attached themselves to the larger beast.  They are fast and deadly and you can't see them coming until they're right on top of you!

With J.J. Abrams attached as producer, I (perhaps unfairly)expected ""Cloverfield"" to be a better film. Having said this, I will probably rent it and watch it again when it comes out on DVD, just to see if I like it any better the second time.",1200787200,,4076,5.017804154302671
1589470,4,B00005JPXY,"This film is a true spectacle. No more. No less.
Boosted by a remarkable marketing campaign (which involved the five-minute snippet involving Lady Liberty's head rolling down a New York street, as well as misleading Japanese ads, and fake international news reports of oil rigs being mysteriously sucked down in the middle of the ocean) the film had fans lined up, eager to finally see the source of all destruction, the infamous Cloverfield monster. Producer J.J. Abrams (of MI:III and Lost fame) and first-time director Matt Reeves had a lot of expectations to live up to. And boy, do they deliver.
""Blair Witch"" meets ""Godzilla""? More or less, but it's more than that. While the makers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" understood that what you don't see is a lot more frightening than actually showing something scary, their film was all anticipation, with no resolution, and we as the audience felt cheated at the end.
It's a tricky concept, one that Shyamalan's ""Signs"" also tried to sustain, and almost did, but the alien revealed at the end was a lot more plain than the ones our imaginations envisioned. In terms of keeping us on the edge of our seats ""Cloverfield"" works perfectly, wisely panning away at the most interesting moments (Holy... did we see it? Was that a...? Argh, we want to see more!) up till the end, when we get a glorious long shot of the thing... and it's damn frightening. It could have been even more frightening, but as the US PG-13 answer to Japan's Godzilla, this will do just fine. More than that, in the midst of all other Hollywood blockbusters, ""Cloverfield"" stands out as one of the better ones of the past decade or so.
Like ""Blair Witch..."", the whole film is based on 'found footage' in what used to be Central Park, NYC. The first twenty minutes is all build-up, and for those who complained that the characters are shallow and self-absorbed, well tough, welcome to the real world. Have you been to college recently? Plus, this film is all about the idea that it's found DV footage, and as that it works brilliantly - it puts aside such strained necessities as character development, as well as the origins of the monster (which makes it more enthralling). All the actors (young unknowns, which adds to the effect) are ultra-realistic. I especially liked the inter-cut previously recorded footage of the main character and his girlfriend having a romantic time, which keeps coming in as a shocking contrast to the current horrific events.
So everyone's partying at this dude's good-bye party, and then - boom! - all goes to hell. From then on it's pretty much non-stop action, and from the Brooklyn-Bridge destruction sequence, to the subway-tunnel chase (was there a more effective use of night-vision recently?), director Reeves knows exactly what buttons to push, and when to push them.
Sure the film is not without its flaws. Some dialogue feels forced and scripted (though not much), some events a bit too coincidental, some of the things the characters survive make you scratch your heads in disbelief...
But it's rare nowadays that a Hollywood monster blockbuster even aspires to be artistic (Batman Begins comes to mind). It's especially rare for a Hollywood monster flick to have such immediacy: certain shots from ""Cloverfield"" - a lone horse in the midde of Manhattan; a dark skyscraper leaning against another, the city burning in the back - are quietly devastating, alluding to our post-9/11 fears, our worst nightmares of an unknown terror. Oh, and there's that one helicopter-scene... But you have to see it for yourself...
""Cloverfield"" made me smile. Here's a film that took some risks, and is exhilirating based purely on that - the originality is like a breath of fresh air, in an industry chocked up with clone-like mega-budget stinkers (hello, Michael Bay). ""Cloverfield"" is a helluva experience, full of sound and fury and a contagious sense of fun its filmmakers must have had coming up with it.
And this comes from a guy who's seen his share of spectacles.",1200787200,,4019,4.88579795021962
1589471,4,B00005JPXY,"The movie that what seems like everyone has been talking about since the middle of last year finally arrived this past Friday in theaters. Cloverfield could be the monster movie surrounded with the most hype to ever be made. Don't confuse that with being the biggest monster movie ever made. It just has the most hype. If you couldn't tell by the trailer, the main premise of the film is that a monster attacks Manhattan. There isn't much story after that, but the beginning of the film goes a little something like this:

Rob is leaving for Japan since he finally got that promotion he's been working so hard for. His friends have decided to surprise him and throw him a big going away party. As a token to remember them by, Lily wants her boyfriend Jason(who's also Rob's brother), to film testimonials from everyone at the party wishing Rob the best of luck in Japan. Jason winds up passing the duty onto Hud, who only takes the job because he finds out Marlena will be at the party whom he has a crush on. Things aren't so good for Rob though as he's in love with Beth. They used to date and Rob even filmed a romantic weekend they had(which you see snippets of throughout the movie). After that weekend though, Rob didn't contact Beth since he was going to be leaving for Japan. Beth took that as a sign that Rob wasn't interested and moved on. She shows up at the party with another guy named Travis. Rob and Beth get into an argument about the way things left off between them and Beth and Travis wind up leaving because of it. Rob winds up sulking about Beth until Jason and Hud go to talk to him. They basically tell Rob that he needs to go after Beth since he's in love with her. Then a loud crash is heard and all the lights go out. That's when all hell breaks loose.

From here on out, the film revolves around a) the monster attacking the city b) everyone running for their lives and c) the military trying to take it down. There's a scene where Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud are running in the street and they wind up right in front of the monster, then the military comes out of nowhere and just starts blasting it with all the firepower they have. That's one of the most intense scenes in the movie. Worth the price of admission alone. The real gem of the film is the fact that it's all shot with a handheld camera. There is that risk of having motion sickness. It actually affected me a bit in the beginning, but you actually get used to it once the action starts. The camcorder makes things more personal. You get to follow one group of people as they try to survive this mayhem. If it was shot as just a normal movie, it wouldn't be nearly as good. It'd basically be like every other monster movie anyone has ever seen. The acting is also done very well. You believe the horror they're going through. It's the type of film that makes you feel like you need to go back and see it again because you know you missed something.

I did have a few nitpicks about the movie though. The main one being that it felt like it took forever for things to start happening. The motion sickness thing also bothered me more during Rob's party than it did when the city was being destroyed. The other big one was that you never really get a clear shot of the monster. You get glimpses of it and enough to make out certain body parts and how many limbs it has, but even when you finally get to SEE the monster while it's bright outside...the monster is too dark to make out all the details. Don't get me wrong, you still see some of it. I guess I just wanted to see all of it in plain daylight. My other minor nitpick was the ending. It just felt...kinda rushed or something. It wasn't fulfilling. I guess it was to Rob and Beth's story, but it felt like there needed to be something else. Something more.

Some people were upset that the movie didn't provide any answers. Things like where the monster came from and why it's attacking aren't explained in the film. I hear the viral marketing campaign provided a lot of answers and I wish I would've taken part in it when I had the chance. I've caught some of it, but not enough to fully understand everything. The thing is though...you don't really need any answers. You're seeing the film from Hud's point of view. You know what they know, which isn't much. The film accomplished what it set out to do and that's make a pretty good monster movie. And who says everything has to be explained right away anyway? Sometimes once the origin of something this massive is explained, then it's not nearly as good. Sometimes it's better not knowing.

So, bottom line, I really enjoyed Cloverfield. It's actually one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. I actually liked the monster and I'm considering going to see it again. I've already read about a few things I missed the first time around. I'm wondering if there's anything else. I also left out a few things intentionally. A few key parts to the movie concerning the monster, how certain characters die, etc. I have to leave something for you when you see the movie, right? Despite having a few flaws, I think it lived up to the hype. I do plan on owning it once it's released on DVD and I'm more than willing to see a Cloverfield 2...if that rumor is true.

1589472,3,B00005JPXY,"I really wanted to give this movie 4 stars but there are a lot of questions that are never answered and things normal people would not do in real life if this really happened. I mean the movie is trying to make the audience feel like its a real disaster going on why not give the characters some common sense too. What bothered me the most is what the characters did. I understand everything is happening so fast and everyone is under stress but just some of the things they do in the movie are just so stupid.

I like the blair witch/Godzilla approach to the movie it adds to the suspence and makes you feel like your right there. The only problem is would a person really record all this on a cam corder? Probably not but its a movie so anything goes.

The movie is only 113min. long pretty weak after all the hype. I would have liked it to been at least a couple of hours. It takes to long in the beginning and before you know it right when it gets really good its over.

The creature is awesome looking and very original. It actually looks scary and very intimidating. The sounds in the movie were really cool and added to the intense moments and all the chaos. This movie really had you on the edge of your seat. It's a good movie but the majority of the bad reveiws is that it ended to soon and were all just mad because we wanted more. lol This movie really feels like your on a theme park ride. The ending is the worst part of the movie that leaves you stunned and pissed off. Overall don't listen to any bad reviews go watch it and judge for yourself. Love it or hate it It's one hell of a ride.

1589532,5,B00005JPXY,"When I saw the trailer for this movie several months ago, I couldn't wait to see the film.  As time passed, however, I grew worried that perhaps this film could turn out to be another ""Snakes on a Plane""----all internet hype and buzz with absolutely no payoff.  This time, thankfully, the buzz was correct.

  As a kid I grew up enjoying monster movies and its been a long time since we've had a really good film showing a city in danger from a horrifying and mysterious force that can destroy everything in its path.  Recently, Peter Jackson gave us ""King Kong"", who is a sympathetic figure taken from his home and placed in an alien environment against his will.  Jackson, an amazing director, made a good film but the first hour of his film was dull, until we finally reached Skull Island and met the giant ape.  1998's ""Godzilla"" didn't give us the scare I'd hoped for either.  It showed promise but in the end didn't deliver the thrill that I experienced as a kid with the old monster movies.

  ""Cloverfield"" changes all that.  Producer JJ Abrams and director Matt Reeves look to enhance the monster genre with a more realistic and updated look and feel.  While I admit, I was anxious the first 20 minutes to get to the action and a bit frustrated with the shaky ""hand-held"" camera format, I grew accustomed to the filming and was lost to the suspense once the creature and its path of destruction was revealed.  Also, I like the fact that the cast is pretty much unknown, thus providing no distraction from the true star of the film, the monster and the carnage of New York City.  Reeves gives us just enough glimpses of the monster to pique our interest but not overwhelming us with a CGI monster that might come off too unrealistic.

  Some people are obviously aggravated with the lack of facts and answers about the monster, its origins, its survival or destruction and other questions that the film didn't answer.  For me, I enjoyed the fact that we didn't know everything and this aspect of the movie only added to the mystery and suspense of the film.  I don't think we need answers to everything to truly enjoy a storyline in a movie or television show.  Sometimes, our imagination can fill in the blanks better than most directors can and the unknown can really be more frightening than the truth.

  To sum up, this time, a movie lived up to its much-hyped trailer.  Congratulations to Reeves and Abrams on an interesting and thrilling movie that does justice to all celluloid monsters in the history of Hollywood.  I'll be interested to see what extras are included on the dvd, which I will be buying.  Highly recommended!",1200787200,2,2640,4.6072961373390555
1589533,5,B00005JPXY,"If you'll notice, most of the bad reviews here focus on the shaky camera movement and the unanswered questions as to the origin of the monster.  When I first saw Blair Witch when it came out in theaters, I absolutely loathed it because of the shakiness of the camera.  But upon subsequent viewing, it has since become one of my all time favorite horror movies.

Besides the fact that obviously the camera will be shaky if the person filming is constantly running away in terror, if you stop expecting the movie to be another bland. orchestrated, run-of-the-mill, choreographed Hollywood movie, you'll get past the shakiness.  In fact, the realness of the camera movement makes the movie, in my opinion. It is one intense thrill-ride.  As soon as you think it's gonna let up, BOOM!  Something else sends you reeling back into their nightmarish world. The way that one of the main characters meets their fate, I'll probably never get that image out of my head.  Seeing Manhattan destroyed through the eyes of a home video camera made it look so real, I can't even describe the feeling.

I am an end of the world, apocalyptic movie nut, so I was expecting a lot when I went in to see this movie, and it exceeded my expectations.  Is it just me, or is it true that from the time the attacks started, the camera basically never stopped rolling? That makes it even more amazing.  I loved the realism, felt like I was there.  I loved the surprises, LOVED the monster, and loved the people.  BEST movie I've seen in a while!  Did anyone else laugh at the noises the mini-monsters made when they attacked?  My girlfriend and I laughed hysterically!  We definitely got the humor.

I wish more movies were made in this fashion.  I didn't want it to end.  But the ending, oh!  Heartbreaking!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Put aside your expectations and you will not regret the experience you'll have watching this movie.  It lingers with you long after you leave the theater.",1200787200,,1955,4.622093023255814
1589534,1,B00005JPXY,"From all those trailers and commercials of Cloverfield, I was real excited to see this. It gave the intense feeling other monster movies use like Alien. However, many fall backs keep this (probably) great movie from reaching its potential. For one, the camera is very shakey; I understand the producers are trying to give the authentic point of view feeling, but they overdid it and made the camera bounce up and down and moving very rapidly. The beginning was horrible...party scene was tasteless and very long. As I said, don't watch this movie if you know you are sensitive to motion. I left early because I almost threw up, and I'm just giving you sound advice. Hope you find this helpful.",1200787200,12,693,4.735537190082645
1589535,4,B00005JPXY,"Last year when ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" was released several reviewers commented that the hand-held camera movement made them dizzy. Well, I wasn't even aware of the camera in ""BU"" as the story and performances were so solid. But from the minute that ""Cloverfield"" began I was more than aware that the character Hud (would parents really name their son after a disrespectful, often vile cad?), who was capturing all the action with a digital camera, was indeed filming. By that I mean the Hud's camera jerks, flips, flops...just as it would when an amateur is filming. So far so good. The camera movements make sense on a real-life level but all the putzing around of the camera made me physically ill...to the point that I had to look away several times as I thought I would barf.
On the positive side: the physical production is amazing and the use of pretty much unknowns sets up a situation in which the moviemakers have to do their homework with the script, character-development-wise in order for us to invest our interest and time.
There is nothing earth-shaking about the story per se: a monster attacks and goes about demolishing New York City while focusing on a small group of good looking young Lower Manhattan types who take flight as the monster goes about its rampage: everyone is beautiful, everyone is sensitive, emotional and humane which sets this film apart from others of its ilk: these people are young but they are smart, upwardly mobile and more importantly care for each other. It's refreshing, really.
""Cloverfield"" is extremely well thought out and plotted. It is also stylistically sophisticated and well written. It's definitely worth the 10 bucks and an hour and a half of your time. Check it out.",1200787200,64,1725,4.850847457627118
1589536,5,B00005JPXY,"Why Cloverfield works is because it gets right what so many monster movies get wrong.  I'm not talking about the Blair Witch gimmick - Cloverfield would have still worked without that.  Cloverfield is a good movie because it takes its premise seriously.  Yes, the idea of a giant monster destroying a city is inherently ridiculous, but so what?  The American Godzilla failed because Emmerich and Devlin didn't try - they just padded out their endless movie with lots of lame humor and watered-down scares.

Cloverfield avoids the obvious pitfalls and clichs of monster movies: the inept public official, the general who just wants to blindly shoot at the monster no matter what, the scientist who explains it all.  The premise defies rational explanation, so Cloverfield just skips that part.  It relies on the oldest trick in the book: creating characters who you care about.  (You think other filmmakers would catch on to that?)

The story is about Rob, a yuppie New Yorker who is moving to Japan (inside joke) the next day.  Beth, his would-be girlfriend, shows up at his surprise party with another man.  They have a terrible fight and part badly.  Then something (possibly a terrorist attack) happens.  Beth calls Rob to ask for help - she is injured and can't move.  Rob then has to travel through the chaos to get to her.

The gimmick in this movie works brilliantly.  All the footage is from a camcorder found ""in the area formerly known as Central Park.""  The brilliant thing about it is that the footage of the monster is ""recorded over"" the tape of Rob and Beth's first romantic day together, which allows for backstory.  (Watch the background when they are on the Ferris wheel.)  Yes, it is implausible that the camera is always on to catch just the right crucial information, but that is simply part of the premise.

I find myself thinking about this movie much more than other such entertainments.  It is obvious that Rob loves Beth deeply and I was heavily invested in his quest.  This is the type of movie that will improve with repeated viewings.",1200787200,,2063,4.768361581920904

The only thing to critize is that then ending could have been better. Watch it all the way through the credits!

1589538,5,B00005JPXY,"Unfourtuantly, I have to start this review a little negative.  Personally, I loved the movie, my parents went with me to see it last night and my dad was impressed, my mom couldn't watch it due to motion sickness.  Pretty much it has the same type of filming that the ""Blair Witch"" had, which was unsteady shots and jearky, which was expected considering the film was supposed to have been shot with a good old fashioned cam corder.  Pesonally, I liked the raw look given by the cam corder, it made me feel like I was actually a part of the movie and for it to have the effects that it did made it seem so realistic.  Now, enough about the filming, let me talk about the movie itself.  The acting was very believeable, the story very structured, and it was especially creepy considering the creature didn't ever have a name or origin.  The actors in this film touch a point that I have been pondering for quite some time.  It is a known fact that prehistoric fish, that were thought to have been extinct have been discovered, and also there is the lock ness monster.  The point given by the camera man is if these things exist what more is out in the water just waiting.  Overall, there are many scenes that are breath taking and very unexpected, pretty much when the head of the statue of liberty rolls down the street with bite and slash marks on it, you realize then anything is possiable, and truthfully it is.",1200787200,3,1414,4.407692307692308
1589539,5,B00005JPXY,"I know many people want films to be neatly summed up and explained. For some films that is necessary and important. For a film such as ""Cloverfield"" the more that gets explained the more you take away from your audience and the less they can go home with.

This film lets the mind race and wander as to what on earth is actually going on. Since no clear explanation is given, audience members are permitted to speculate and wonder. This film gives just enough info that I felt wholly satisfied, while at the same time leaving enough exposition in the dark as to make me truly feel I was in and amongst the chaos. People that do not like this type of filmmaking should steer clear of this.

The visual echos of 9/11 are very obvious. Some people thought they were done in poor taste. I disagree. I think they gave the film more realism. Actually anything less than what we know reality to look like now when large buildings fall would have been criticized as unrealistic. This film was very realistic looking. Also the film spoke to the state of our society, our fears, and our paranoia. The ignorance the film made you feel is the very real ignorance we all have as to what is actually going on in this world and how we feel helpless in the face of many giant disasters, wars, and people of power. This is not political, rather, it's just timely and reactionary. Godzilla was a reaction to the atomic bombs, as were many atomic films of the day. Aliens attacking us are fears we may not be alone and what is out there may be worse than us. recent disaster films are reactions to 9/11 and what the future may hold. Ultimately all these types of disaster films find their roots in very base human fears of man against nature. We know we are insignificant despite all our progress and these types of films speak volumes about that.

The comments the characters made in the film were just as stupid and lame brain as the ones the audience members were making in the theater, hence more realism. Real people are not actors and do not act cool in crisis. People react in ways that contradict reason during crisis. Going after a loved one is very realistic. People go back for pets so to track down a girlfriend is not much of a leap. As far as friends following, well... suspension of disbelief may be required. Since I was sitting in the theater trying to accept a giant monster destroying Manhattan...well... accepting a few friends tagging along to rescue some dudes girl was not hard to accept.

If you need everything explained, if you don't like shaky camera work, if you hate Godzilla films, and if you thought ""Independence Day"" was great, then stay away from this. You will hate it.

There were stretches of this film that were utterly intense, and I have the fingernail marks in the arm from my girlfriend to prove it.  I will admit I am a big LOST fan so I was excited about Abrams' first mainstream film attempt.  At the end of the day, this was the most fun I had at the movies in QUITE a long time.  I recommend seeing it now for the shock value, before most of the content penetrates the media in trailers and previews as I anticipate this movie will become very successful.

1589611,5,B00005JPXY,"When I write a review for a book or a movie, I usually give a plot summary.  Since all of us either know what this is about or can very easily find out, I'm not going to bother.  What I am going to do is point out some of the criticisms against this film and do my best to debunk them:

1.  The camera movement is too shaky-

True, it is very shaky and shaky to the point of being annoying.  Then again, how is the average person supposed to keep a camera steady while running away from a monster the size of a luxury liner?  Or from nasty dog-sized spiderlike vermin whose sting can literally make a person explode?

2.  The dialogue is bad-

When confronted with a life or death situation, do we:

a.  Think of what Shakespeare or Marcel Proust would say?
b.  Say only what is necessary and just try to stay alive?

Cloverfield tries to speculate as to how REAL people would handle a giant monster attacking their city.  Real people don't have cool one-liners for every occasion.  That's life.

3.  We don't learn where the monster comes from-

After all the ridiculous explanations (extraterrestrial origin, radiation, etc.) we have been given over the years, do we really need another one?  Keep in mind that the main characters are not scientists or government insiders, they are just common people who are learning as they go along.  But mainly, their primary goal is just to survive.

4.  We only catch momentary glimpses of the monster-

No argument here.  If I was more artistically inclined and someone were to ask me to draw a complete picture of the Cloverfield monster, I would not be able to based on what I saw from the film.  Since the shots come from a cell phone camera, how could anyone get a perfect view?

Take my explanations or leave them.  This movie in my opinion is the best giant monster film since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws</a>.  For having such a relatively small budget ($30 million), the effects are stunning.  The scenes in which we see the city's devastation actually looked realistic.  I also found the treatment of such a seemingly lowbrow subject matter to be surprisingly dignified and literate.

Cloverfield does not try to be the next Godzilla film.  After the 1998 fiasco, that is something for which we all should all be grateful.",1200700800,8,2371,4.818407960199005
1589612,5,B00005JPXY,"""Cloverfield"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.

It reminded me of being at ground zero on 9-11.  The acting was pretty bad too in some cases.  Unfortunately the worst was the guy holding the camera- terrible actor. And it would have been deeper if we had a little more information about the creatures.  The stupid jocks we're following around are too stupid to think much about it.  They stole the running rat scene from 28 Days Later, and let's face it- they stole the whole camera thing from Blair Witch.

First off lets give some credit to the incredible job the producers did marketing this film. For all the months leading up to its release potential viewer's searched the internet for clews as to what this film may be about, all to no avail. No movie I've ever seen has been surrounded by so much mystery. What is it really about? Is it a giant monster? Aliens? Government tests? What? You really have to see it (or read reviews on Amazon) to find out.

The movie is shot completely, from beginning to end, on a hand held digital camera that different characters take turns filming with throughout the course of the movie, very much like Blair Witch Project. Although this can take some getting used to, and yes it did make me extremely dizzy and disoriented, the artistic benefits from filming a movie in this way are obvious from the beginning. Viewers are able to see enough of the action and disaster to satisfy the biggest action junky, yet enough is left unexplained that the movie doesn't at any time seem fake or scripted. You are able to see the entire story as it unfolds though the eyes of a very small group of people which allows you to identify and ultimately sympathize with them. As well as giving the movie a more personal effect, the home camera gives this movie a very post 9/11 feel. We've all seen the shots of the WTC falling in NYC and people running for their lives as the dust from the towers quickly moves down the street engulfing everything in its path. Watching the Empire State Building fall to pieces before your very eyes will bring back memories of those fateful days in 2001 when our lives changed forever. The camera style also gives this movie a very Jaws like effect. The director of this film was able to show just enough of the monster to satisfy his audience, yet also hide it enough so that by the end you still aren't quite sure what it was or what it looked like. Although there are some shots where the monster thing is in full view and staring right at the camera, it is still hard to see because the camera is of such ""poor"" quality and doesn't allow you to see much. The monster is hidden in full view, a brilliant way of building suspense that is as scary as it is original (at least in the giant monster genera).

Despite the very blatant references to 9/11 it is very refreshing to see a film that is brave enough to re-create that fateful day yet stay neutral on any political commentary. Cloverfield does not exist to pass judgment on anyone, or to give its own opinions or views on 9/11, instead it tries, and succeeds in my opinion, in showing how the events took place from the eyes of those who witness it. The movie focuses on the disaster itself, separating itself from all the political commentary and conspiracy theories that followed, and for that I give it major props for that.

Although the movie steers clear of a lot of political commentary, it does not hesitate to give us a generous helping of social commentary. What does everyone do when the see the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street? They take pictures on their camera phones of course, and then they huddle around the video camera to get a glimpse of what it was that just invaded their city. What do people do when the cops and military are preoccupied with fighting off the giant monster? They loot electronic stores and steal TV's and radios, a clear reference to the chaos that followed disaster in New Orleans and to a lesser extent Baghdad after the US invasion. People watch spongbob squarpants along with news footage of the destruction of Manhattan. Its the little things like this that are what sets Cloverfield above Godzilla and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JO20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;(as much as I love Peter Jackson) and makes it something memorable and special.

But this movie doesn't get bogged down in its social commentary and 9/11 references. in its heart of hearts Cloverfield, for all its artistic filming style and commentary, really just wants to be an action/horror movie. From the second the monster shows up in the city to the very end every minute is filled with gun battles, fighter jets flying overhead unleashing their rockets into the city, and old fashioned giant monster destroying the city fun. This is what Godzilla should have been, instead of being a Hollywood style movie, shot in a very unoriginal and cheesy style with an unimaginative script and plot, Cloverfield manages to give action on a monumental scale yet show its audience relatively little of what is actually going on. The scares in this movie resemble those found in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>. There is a scene about halfway though the movie that takes place in an underground tunnel in almost complete darkness with all the light coming from a few dim lights in the ceiling and a night vision scope on the camera, reminiscent of similar scenes in last years sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>. This movie does not rely on cheap scares that any idiot can do, instead it slowly builds up tension and manages to keep its audience tense and scared throughout its entire running time.

Believe the hype people, this movie not only lives up to the mystery and excitement of its trailers but surpasses them. This movie has all the potential to become the next great cult classic and join the ranks of horror greats from history. Move aside Godzilla, there's a new giant monster in town.

1589615,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield brought a neat perspective on a monster flick, in more ways than one. The hand held camera work was pretty hard to watch at first. Mainly, the first character using the camera was just really bad at it and shot a lot of random things like feet. Much like you would expect to see from some of your friends videos ;) All of the bad camera was intentional. It does get better but still maintains the very hand held sensation. One of my friend's wife really didn't like the cameras throughout the movie. However, the cinematography didn't bother me much, must be from all my years playing first person shooters.

It is impressive that this film was made on a budget slightly more than $30 million (which in all reality it is sad that $30 million is considered a small movie budget these days). The effects were surprisingly well done and the monster is not as illusive as you would imagine from a lower budget film. The film manages to show it throughout the movie (at least once it is revealed). The monster did have one unique trait that came as a surprise to me. I'm not going to say what it is in order to avoid spoiling anything for you.

As far as the story goes, the movie doesn't provide as much closure or details about the incident as I would like. My guess is that they'll do something special when the film is released on DVD to address this. On the other hand, the lack of closure did make for a more interesting conclusion and it was nice to see a deviation from the typical American movie ending. Cloverfield is a relatively short movie but does provide decent character introductions and a plot.

They movie does manage to bring some humor to an otherwise non-humorous story through one of the camera guys. This humor is done well enough not to detract from what's going on because it fits right in with one of the character's mentality.

It is hard for me to say whether or not I liked the movie. I didn't really have an expectations going in- mainly due to the secrecy of the story and my avoidance of reading any potential spoilers. I do believe I liked the movie but its not a must see or a movie that I would buy. At the same time, I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid watching it if they were intrigued by the previews. So my recommendation is go see if it you think you are interested so you know for your self what all the hype is about. You may just really like it.",1200700800,,2393,4.3467561521252795

1589617,5,B00005JPXY,"J.J.Abram's boldly tells the story of those civilians who flee the city under giant monster attack from all those films in the 50's. The classic and contemporary Godzilla movies tell the story from the scientist and the army's perspective, never the little guy, only the big picture. ""Cloverfield"" focuses on those little guys and sells it by having the film done in blocks of ""real time"" video, which must be difficult to orchestrate on such mass extra fleeing-scenes. This is plenty brave to have a major picture without any major stars (another aspect that adds an edge of reality to the project), without music soundtrack (naturally, although Godzilla fans should stay for the end credits which include a revamp of the ""Tokyo Evacuation March"") and the boldest aspect: without a camera tripod. Like `em or hate `em there's little time to worry about that as the pace of the film is pretty rapid, and overall the film is a trim hour and a half (probably the best given the unorthodox visuals). Naturally, there's no ""big"" explaination offered or omniscient narration to clear things up, but honestly would the ""little guy"" really get one? I'm still waiting on the tidy epilogue following Katrina.

The big question: How does the monster look?
The Answer: Pretty cool, pretty original, but it really is less the point, than the reactions mand behavior of our fleeing cast. And just to make things creepy--er, there are smaller critters to be found in Manhattan in addition to the daddy-mama-monster.

Again, ""Cloverfield"" is the tale of some survivors of a giant-monster attack, survivors who need some advice on how to behave in a monster movie:

1.) Never go BACK into the city, during the evacuation
2.) Never take the Subway tunnel to go BACK into the city during evac.
3.) Once in the subway tunnels, follow the fleeing rats!
4.) Monster bites are bad!
5.) Listen to the army guys.
6.) Don't try to video tape the entire event.

1589691,5,B00005JPXY,"After witnessing (and pondering and questioning over) an insane teaser trailer before summer's ""Transformers,"" and then going on film boards and searching for any information, I've been slightly hooked on ""Cloverfield"". I'm a fan of J.J. Abrams' work (mostly ""Lost""), love creature-features, and most of all, mystery surrounding films. Never before have I seen such a better marketing job than ""Cloverfield"". Everyone was left in the open, making up their own ideas for what exactly was destroying New York City, where it came from, and most importantly, what it looked like. In other words, the hype was huge for this film and going into it, I knew that it just couldn't meet my expectations. Well, it did just that and possibly exceeded them.

The film opens in New York City, where a goodbye-party is being held for Rob (Michael-Stahl David), whose leaving the country for a job in Japan. At the party, his best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is given the task of filming the entire get-together. Throughout his ""documenting"", we observe Rob's brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Ford) flirting and being cute with each other, Hud's crush on a girl named Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), and finally, Rob's dilemma with his best friend, Beth (Odette Yustman), who he recently just slept with and has feelings for (which he hasn't told her about, of course). Anyway, Beth and Rob get into an argument and she leaves the party in a hurry. As Rob is talking about his relationship with her, the party is interrupted by what seems like an earthquake. The party-goers rush to the streets only to see the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty land in the streets. From this point on, we know that whatever caused the earthquake is no earthquake and whatever it is, it's big and not of this world. The army comes in to evacuate, but Beth leaves a message on Rob's phone, telling her that she's in trouble and needs help. With Hud, Marlena, Lily, and his brother in tow, Rob decides to head towards her apartment, away from safety and right into the path of the monster's destruction.

The plot is fairly simple and not entirely original. A monster attacks New York City, while people try to outrun and live throughout the destruction around them. The core of the film though is not exactly the monster, but more the love story between Rob and Beth. It's not shown in a melodramatic, sappy way and there's not much dialog between the two characters, but it keeps the film together (I mean, if there wasn't a connection between the two, Rob wouldn't go into the city and there would be no movie). Rob is a person that many guys can relate to (wants to tell his feelings to the girl he's always liked) and that makes him even more believable and the audience can understand his actions because of this. Since their relationship is strong, the film becomes even more intense as you want to see both of them and Rob's friends make it through the ordeal.

Speaking of Rob and his friends, they are played by mostly unknown actors, which also helps the film. Not one actor is really well known save for Mike Vogel (""Poseidon"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake) and that really helped me identify more with who they were as characters in the film instead of who was playing them. Michael Stahl-David does a great job as Rob and you feel for him as his friends begin to die even while he's still determined to save Beth. The best actor in the film though is definitely T.J. Miller. He brings a much needed amount of comic relief as the film's camera-man, but also layers of drama that I didn't expect to see from him (one scene of his, in particular, was quite heartbreaking). The rest of the cast do a fine job and were all believable, great in their roles, and you didn't want them to die.

Another issue to bring up about the movie is how it's filmed. It's all done with a video camera that someone's dad would use to film his son's baseball game. At first, this can be nauseating (the party scene), but you get used to it and it really attributes to the greatness of the film. By shooting it in this style, everything feels real (even if it is CGI), because it's shown in a perspective that everyday people have experienced. Also, since the film is from one view, the audience is on the ride with these people and you follow them through the streets, tunnels, buildings, and more, as the creature attacks them and others. Two scenes, in particular, are intense, mainly because of the use of the camera. One takes place in a subway tunnel with something else besides the main creature (I'll get to this later) and the other, in the streets, as the group tries to run to safety, the creature closes in on them, crushing everything in its path. As much as I was apprehensive about the filming style, I'm happy to say that it makes the film even better than it is and gives it a mood that no other creature feature will be able to imitate.

Finally, the main reason most people will see this movie is for the monster and let me say, it does not disappoint. I'm not going to give away much about what it looks like, but all I'm going to say is that it's huge, walks like a bat would, eats people, and little creatures climb off its body. These little creatures are the ones that make their presence known in the subway scene (mentioned above). These things are fast, vicious, and their bite leaves a not-so-pretty consequence. The monster definitely lived up to the hype for me and its little minions just added to the greatness about it.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting was top-notch, the filming style was unique and original, the special effects were amazing, the story was simple, but effective, and finally, the monster was amazingly done. As much as I loved the movie, I have a feeling that I'll never get the impact I did when I first watched it. I may be wrong though. After all, I didn't think the movie would live up to my expectations and I was wrong about that. It's not a classic by any means, but it gives you exactly what you came to the theaters for - a scary, intense, thrilling ride. And a darn good one at that.",1200700800,2,6154,4.564705882352941
1589692,4,B00005JPXY,"I don't understand the movie-going public anymore.  Every time I see a movie I go into it open-minded and willing to go along for the director's ride.  And in this case, ""Cloverfield"" is literally a ride.  It seems like it'd fit right in with any 3-D or interactive theme park ride, like Universal Studios' ""B2tF Ride"" and ""T2 the Ride.""  Why did the a-holes behind me need everything to be explained?  This film is basically a civilian's account of a Godzila-esque attack and it works on that level.  It doesn't explain why the military was able to mobilize so quickly, why the creature exists, why it attacks NYC.  What we care about is Rob, Lily, Hud, Beth, Rob's brother, and Marlena.  This is a human survival movie not unlike ""Body Snatchers.""

Terrible dialogue?  The only thing I found unrealistic about the dialogue was the fact that no one cursed, which I guarantee I'd be doing if poop hit the fan like it did in the movie.  And as far as Hud's inappropriate interjections of humor, I bought it.  As a storytelling device, this movie with no humor would not have been as enjoyable as it ended up being.  Those awkward moments of laughter work for the audience to break the tension.  As a character, Hud says stupid things just to break the tension a little bit so he can feel a sense of normalcy in this ludicrous situation he's in.
Of COURSE of you don't get sucked into a movie you're going to find flaws in it.  The camera is shaky because that's how it would really be handled in that situation!  The dialogue is bad because this is supposed to reflect real life, not a movie.  This movie preys on our 9/11 memories becase it's what would happen to us even if it were really happening.  We'd all be going ""Jesus God, not again.""  Those who hate this movie because the destruction is too real looking and is based on the 9/11 destruction, what did you expect from a movie about a giant monster attacking New York City?

A lot of words and a lot of hate for the ciritcs aside, I dug this movie a lot and it is truly a heart-pounding experience I haven't had since I rode my last roller coaster.  If a movie ever needed a seat belt, this one is it.",1200700800,2,2160,4.390428211586902
1589693,4,B00005JPXY,"I noticed most of the negative reviewers on here seem to be comparing Cloverfield to the Godzilla mess of a decade ago. That right there should tip you off to quit reading. I of course had to see what all the fuss was about after all the hype and monster concealment. The camera was too jerky, but it really didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I liked how you felt as if you were in the movie the entire time. Even the end credits leave you feeling like you watched real events on a tape someone left behind. The acting was pretty good for the most part and the CGI monster/New York City destruction looked real.

If you get motion sickness easily, avoid at all costs. Otherwise, you can't miss this experience.",1200700800,2,723,4.3161764705882355
1589694,5,B00005JPXY,"First of all, all of those people complaining about how this movie didn't reveal any answers about the creature, you obviously didn't get the point.  This isn't a standard monster movie.  It's a pseudo-documentary of the chaos.  And not told from the perspective of the military, Department of Defense, emergency personnel, the president, etc.  but from the point of few of just a bunch of regular twenty-something year-olds having a going-away party for the main character, Rob, only to have it become the worst day of their lives.  To use a good analogy, a lot of people have compared the destruction of NYC in this movie to 9/11.  In all of the camera footage that was being filmed by regular people such as tourists right as 9/11 was happening, was there any mention of Osama Bin Laden, Al Queda, trade embargoes and bombings of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, etc.  No, there wasn't.  It was just chaos and terror all around.  The same thing is happening here.
  Also don't believe all of those reviews who say that there's nothing likable about the cast.  From the very beginning it's obvious that Rob cares about and even loves Beth.  WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!  The film even begins with a previously recorded segment of about a month ago where Rob wakes up and eventually wakes Beth up, whom he just slept with.  It's revealed that they're heading out to Coney Island that day as she has never been there before.  Cut to a month later with a new recording been done over the other one.  This one is Rob's brother, Jason, and his girlfriend, Lily, setting up a surprise going-away party for Rob as he's leaving for Japan.  The assign Rob's dunderheaded, yet lovable friend, Hud, with the task of gaining testimonials from people wishing Rob good luck.  Which Hud accepts once he learns that Lily's friend, Marlena, is going to be at the party.  Marlena is a bit of a loner, but it's obvious that Hud likes her, even though she doesn't remember him from the few times that they've met.  It's funny the way that he badly tries to hit on her and get her to say something for the camera. Eventually Beth shows up with her own date in tow, which leaves Rob distraught.  Jason and Hud get Lily to reveal that Rob and Beth, who had been friends since high school, slept together a few weeks ago.  However Rob didn't call Beth again after their day at Coney Island.  Rob says something insulting to Beth's date and he and Beth then get into a fight with her storming back to her own apartment.  Hud and Jason then try to cheer Rob up when suddenly a huge tremor occurs.

  WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! All the electricity goes out for a few seconds and then when it comes back on, everyone sees the news about an oil tanker having been destroyed.  They go up to the roof and then see an explosion.  They then all go down to street level where they see the head of the Statue of Liberty tossed into their street along with an eventual glimpse of some skyscraper-sized monster.  And then all hell breaks loose.  At first all of them try going across the Brooklyn Bridge with throngs of masses only to have the tail of the mysterious monster destroy the bridge, taking Jason's life.  When the others get together to cope with the horror of Jason's death, Rob says that he needs to go see Beth since she called him saying that she was trapped in her building.  It's obvious therefore that he loves her, which makes the ending all the more tragic.  You care for the friends who follow him out of loyalty even when he tells them that they can follow the Army out of Manhattan.  You really come to care for Rob and Beth since they both love each other.  You also feel sorry for Hud, whom himself is cares for Marlena and tries to cheer her up with jokes after she saves his life, ultimately at the expense of her own, as some bites that she sustains end up doing her in (which is then disturbing to Hud).  Hud was an extra treat for me, as he provided some of the light comic relief that was almost a mirror of one of my friends whom I saw the movie with.  Me and the others were teasing him about it all throughout the film.

  As for the monster.  What can you say about the monster?  It definitely wasn't Godzilla (as rumors leading up to the film's release said it was).  Throughout most of the movie you only see short glimpses of its appendages and tail.  It's also revealed that parts of its body fall off and turn into big spider-like creatures which then attack people (they're the ones that do Marlena in).  A few times we see the creatures face and jaws open wide, but only briefly.  It isn't until five minutes to the end when we get what in my opinion is the money shot of the whole ordeal.  Early morning in Central Park after a helicopter crash, Hud finds himself underneath the behemoth looking up, to which the creature looks down at him and you see a perfectly clear view of the monster's ugly mug with Hud shuddering in horror just before it does him in. END ALL SPOILERS!

  Ultimately the movie is a great mix of terror, tragedy, and light humor at a few times, and even some romance (but not heavy-handed and cheesy, but rather brief, subtle, and genuine).  It wasn't Godzilla, but it blew away that ridiculous Godzilla movie of a decade ago.  You would feel any empathy for this monster, but will instead feel that it's something that came straight from hell.  The only legitimate reasons that I could think of for not seeing or liking this movie is if you have a bit of a queasy stomach for overly shaky cameras and footage that brings up the memory of 9/11.  Otherwise, YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

P.S.  For those you that might want some answers, near the end when the video show the lovely couple of Rob and Beth at Coney Island a month ago, off in the horizon you can see something falling from the sky into the ocean.  Most likely it's the monster itself.",1200614400,,5892,4.452336448598131
1589695,1,B00005JPXY,"That's a first for me, and I've been going to the movies for close to 40 years!

 The film jerked around almost constantly throughout the entire movie! It was so bad that a warning was posted all over the place at the movie theater that I attended. The sign read: "" Warning! This film will can cause motion sickness similar to that of a roller coaster ride!"" I have to admit, I thought at first the theater must be kidding, but when I ended-up having to close my eyes through 75% of the movie, the warning was a gross under statement! And it was unbearably annoying!

Then the acting was terrible! Everyone came across as two-dimensional cardboard, with a pretty face! The beginning of the story reminded me of a dull soap opera until the monster strikes, then it reminded me of a cheap, Made-in-Japan, 1950's style, monster movie! How dull and tedious can you get?

I guess the worst part was how much the destruction was made to remind anyone without amnesia how horrible the 9/11 disaster was! What a filmmaker will do to make a buck! Members of my own family missed being killed or injured by the skin-of-there-teeth or from dumb luck! Do I, and tens of thousands of other movie goers, who were directly affected by 9/11 need to be reminded of this real life horror when we go out to be entertained? Memo to future filmmakers: Try and have a little imagination and wreck a different city next time!

And to think the director of this film, J.J. Abrams, is the same director working on the new Star Trek movie. I can just imagine what a muddled mess he's going to create if Cloverfield is the best he can do!

This is, without a doubt, absolutely one of the very worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life! What ever you do - don't bring your children, or someone with post traumatic stress issues, an inner ear infection or prone to migraine headaches to this movie! You'll be doing them a very big favor, indeed!

1589696,5,B00005JPXY,"First and foremost, the buzz created by Cloverfield is well deserved.  There will be people who dislike the acting, cliffhangers, or even the filming techniques.  What can't be denied, however, is the epic nature of this movie, and the way in which the viewer is drawn into the chaos.

Cloverfield starts off with the beginnings of a surprise party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David).  Everyone is getting together in his swanky Manhattan loft to see him on his way to a new career opportunity in Japan.  His friend Lily (Jessica Lucas) and his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) are playing hosts, and it is a joyous event throughout.  Then Rob's love interest Beth (Odette Yustman) shows up with a date.

The party continues on, but it's clear that Rob is not himself.  It's evident because the film's humor source, Hud (TJ Miller), is filming every detail of every guest, and happens to catch a fight between Rob and Beth.  Aside from that, Hud keeps gravitating towards Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), a girl in which he's extremely interested.  They have evidently met several times before, but Marlena doesn't remember Hud, and definitely doesn't want anything to do with his company or the camera.

And then all hell breaks loose.

Manhattan shakes.  The ground rumbles, and the tremors are palpable throughout the city.  Lights go off, screams ring through the air, and it's too close not to remember the events of 9/11.  The residents are frightened out of their minds.  Despite initial reports of an earthquake, in no time at all, we learn that not only are the massive sounds and tremors not earthquakes, but instead they are the ear-splitting footsteps of some gigantic monster attacking the city, destroying everything in its path.

The party-goers dash for the street, where they see fireballs, massive chunks of buildings being ripped from hinges, and the Statue of Liberty's head come flying down the street like the view from pins at giant's bowling alley.

An epic battle ensues in which the group goes into the heart of the battle, as Rob, Lily, Hud, and Marlena go to find Beth, who left for her apartment after the fight.  They brave the unknown, monsters that are beyond imagination, and darkness through which nothing but fear can be felt.  Drawing perfectly upon fear of the unknown and the loss of sense and perception, the group makes and incredibly dangerous and scary decision to travel through the shutdown, blacked-out subway tunnels.  As they're making their way through the city, they are caught in the middle of heavy fire; the military has brought countless troops, artillery, rocket launchers, and jets to saturate the monster's surroundings with bombs.  It becomes clear in no time that the military is losing the battle.

The true genius of this movie is in its concept from beginning to end.  The buzz leads to the anticipation; the usage of a handheld camera for the entire movie's filming style leads to the realistic chaos.  In fact, the shaky, spastic, sometimes confusing camera shots are perhaps the movie's strength and weakness at the same time.  While lending towards credibility, it leaves the audience wanting to see more, changing a point of view for the hopes of a split second's more viewing time.  I wanted to scream a Hud - despite his diligence - to focus a bit more on the action, to ignore the fear for even a split second so I could see the monster and the destruction.  The panic and fear are both understandable and realistic.

The ending leads to a desire for more.  The viewer is left wanting, needing to find a more complete resolution.  Perhaps 50 people waited through the entire list of credits for a hope of an extra scene, maybe a hint about the actual ending, even the slightest bit more information.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another monster movie, or a cheesy Godzilla movie shot through a handheld camera.  It's incredibly intense and provides shock, suspense, fear, and surprise around every corner.  It's wonderfully mysterious, completely original, and sets a new standard for the horror movie genre.",1200614400,,4080,4.890829694323144
1589697,2,B00005JPXY,"The movie ""Cloverfield"" is good at what it does. Remember all thost great scenes in Alien, for example, where the wreckage and bodies are piling up, the lights are flashing, and there's this great suspenseful moment with The Thing not yet emerged from the shadows? This movie does that scene really well.

That's all it does. Really. That's it, front to back, beginning to end, but with bouncy hand-held cameras and yelling. That's all.

The end.

1589698,4,B00005JPXY,"Ever since I was about 4, I have been a diehard fan of giant monster movies. Godzilla, of course, was my favorite. I have fond memories of going to Hastings to rent another monster movie almost each week. As I grew older, my appreciation never ceased, but I began to long for a big-budget American monster movie. My wish kind of came true.

That ""wish come true"" came in the form of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;starring Matthew Broderick. Yes, the movie was a multi-million dollar American film. Yes, the main monster was Godzilla. No, it wasn't very good at all. Godzilla (or GINO) wasn't about an almost-indestructible monster wreaking havoc in New York and striking fear into the hearts of horrified victims. It was an over-sized lizard that just wanted to be left alone, so it could lay its eggs. As a film by itself, it was okay, but as a ""Godzilla movie"", it was an insult.

After that, no one in America even TRIED to touch a monster movie. It was left to the Japanese again, as well as Korea who began to experiment on the genre, to make the monster movies. Over the next decade, many good and succesful (and bad and unsuccesful) monster movies were released, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-2000/dp/B00003CXLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla 2000</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-Mothra-and-King-Ghidorah-Giant-Monsters-All-Out-Attack/dp/B0000VAGXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah - Giant Monsters All-Out Attack</a>, Godzilla's 50th Anniversary film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-Final-Wars/dp/B000BMY2L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla - Final Wars</a>, the recent Korean film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Wars/dp/B000YDOOEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Wars</a>, and the much-more-succesful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Host/dp/B000PKG8TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Host</a>. With newly-growing interest in the U.S. (and even an American theatrical run of Dragon Wars), the time was ripe for another attempt in the U.S.

It started with a trailer attached to the new live-action Transformers film. The trailer showed the general skeleton of the beginning of the film and did not reveal its name, only saying that it was a new film from J.J. Abrams and ""1-18-08"". Many viral sites and further speculation of what the title could be quickly brought the hype to unbelievable heights. But one thing was certain: it was the first giant monster movie to be made in America in 10 years and that was reason to see no matter what the title.

""Cloverfield"" is finally here and this is what I thought about it:

***SPOILER WARNING***

First off, one of the biggest aspects is the fact that the entire movie is shown through a standard home video camera. I would like to say that I have never seen ""The Blair Witch Project"", so I wasn't distracted by comparing the two, like many others seemed to have been. Those that may not have enjoyed The Bourne Ultimatum's shaky camera will hate this move. I went to see this with two friends and one was fine, but the other got nauseated and left the theater even before the 1/3 mark. This didn't bother me too much, having a very strong stomach, but after a while, even I felt a little weird. So those of you who have weak stomachs, at least wait until it comes out on DVD.

The next aspect I want to point out is (what else) the monster. Now this is the reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars. Through most of the movie, the monster remains hidden and when his full profile does show up, blink and you'll miss it. When a few good shots finally showed the full monster, I kind of wished it had stayed hidden. I didn't think it looked very imposing, as I thought it would at first. To counter some of those rumors that the monster was an enourmous walking whale, they were WAY off. The monster is basically a giant spider monkey with no fur, gills and a reptillian tail. It did, however, remind me of some of the more outlandish Japanese inventions from back in the day, so maybe that's what Abrams was shooting for. Much more frightening though, were the creature's offspring. It was these that brought all of the horror aspects to the movie. They were much more spider-like than the giant ""queen"" and for some reason reminded me of Shelob from the ""Lord of the Rings"". Their reproductive system also reminded me of the horror film ""Alien"".

Next up, the plot...okay so maybe there isn't much to it. A guy by the name of Rob gets a surprise going away party the night before he leaves to go to Japan. The party is crashed, however, by a giant monster that emerges from the ocean and attacks Manhattan. There you go. The fact that there isn't really a plot makes sense, however, since a dude that just happens to have a camcorder isn't going to try to make an all-out epic film with a plot and all around something that is happening at this very moment. The movie really acts like it really happened, complete with a prologue and epilogue saying that this footage is government property and was found in ""former Central Park"". Overall, I think this could serve as a good ""prologue"" film for a much longer possible series. This theory is better supported after the credits, with a garbled radio transmition that, when said backwards, means ""it's still alive"".

Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gojira-Godzilla/dp/B000FA4TLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gojira / Godzilla</a>before it, this film simbolizes the fears that the country has recently experienced. Godzilla represented the fears of the nuclear bomb, while ""Cloverfield"" represents the recent 9/11 attack and the fear of another attack. Much of the destruction, I noticed, resembled what was seen on that fateful day, complete with a lot of flying dust and bewildered people lulling around the streets.

If you're a fan of monster movies and don't care about shaky cameras, see this movie NOW! It was very much worth the ticket price and I walked out, hoping that ""Cloverfield"" would receive enough praise and money to inspire a sequel (which so far, it's going along the right track).",1200614400,,6494,5.5241448692152915
1589699,5,B00005JPXY,"After months of media hype, the J.J. Abrams-produced ""Cloverfield"" finally hit theaters, and the movie definitely delivers. ""Cloverfield"" is, without a doubt, the best monster flick yet made! I won't go into details about the plot, but it is very intense, exciting, and quite scary at times, with good performances from a terrific cast. The use of a P.O.V. style of film-making makes this film all the more believable.
I won't go into detail about the main monster, except to say that it is fantastic! The only spoiler I have is this: along with the main monster, there are also hundreds of little creatures, and they are terrifying to behold as well! This film definitely puts ""Godzilla"" to shame. This is a terrific film that fans of sci-fi, horror, and monster films will want to see! One of the best ever made!

1589779,5,B00005JPXY,"There are monster movies and then there's ""Cloverfield,"" a film that many have correctly described as a cross between the ""Godzilla"" films and ""The Blair Witch Project."" Rather than conventional movie cameras and conventional movie camera tricks, a handheld camcorder is utilized for this film, meaning that the visuals are effectively reduced to shaky close ups, choppy cuts, and problems with lighting and focusing. But camera tricks are only part of what makes ""Cloverfield"" so incredible: here's a film that reinvents the grade-B atomic films of the 1950s, first be eliminating the cheesy science fiction of outer space aliens, undersea creatures, and genetic mishaps, second by including a plausible and tense character story. This movie is not about camp--it's all about panic, fear, and the terror of a monstrous giant destroying New York City.

The film's real genius is in its mystery. Much like the characters, we too are completely in the dark about the situation, and we remain so even after the film ends. What exactly is this creature? Where did it come from? Why is it attacking? Since these questions are never answered, your guess is as good as mine. And that's exactly the way it should be, since the science-related explanations of films like ""Godzilla,"" ""Them!"" ""Mothra,"" and ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" are so worn out and ridiculous. We don't even get a real sense of what this creature looks like, although we are treated to some brief glimpses and a silhouetted long shot near the end of the film. I'll spare you a description, simply because I want this review to be just as elusive and enticing as the film's ad campaign.

The human story is appropriately simple and insignificant, given the fact that we only care about the action. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) has received and accepted a job opportunity from Japan; his friend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), and his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), see him off with a surprise party, one that would have been a blast were it not for Rob's would-be girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman) showing up with another man. Assigned the task of capturing testimonials with a camcorder is his friend, Hud (T.J. Miller)--he quickly forgets his assignment and begins filming everything, including the inevitable fight between Rob and Beth. Hud also begins following a girl named Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), who doesn't know anyone at the party that well and doesn't seem too comfortable with Hud or the camera.

Everything comes to a grinding halt when the ground momentarily shakes, causing the power to fluctuate and an oilrig near the Statue of Liberty to collapse. The news reluctantly speculates that an earthquake has struck New York City. But the truth is quickly revealed, and at that point, all hell breaks loose; an explosion across the river sends up a massive fireball, forcing everyone at the party to run out of the building. Soon after, the head of the Statue of Liberty comes skidding down the street, and that's immediately followed by the collapse of a massive skyscraper. The resulting cloud of dust and debris engulfs everything, forcing Hud, Rob, Jason, Lily, and Marlena to take refuge in a convenience store. While there, Marlena says something to the effect of, ""I saw it! It's alive!"" No one has a moment to question her because ground-splitting footsteps are shattering the windows.

This is only the first in a series of terrifying events documented by Hud, who never once switches the camera off. The Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed as thousands attempt to cross it. Smaller, scorpion-like creatures fall off the giant monster and begin attacking; we eventually learn that being bitten by one of them isn't a good thing. Military units are swamped, not only because of their depleting manpower, but also because of the number of injured civilians. As the city crumbles, Rob gets a frantic cell phone call from Beth, and he realizes that she's trapped within the city. Feeling guilty over the fight they had earlier, he vows to find and save her, no matter what. Hud and the others follow more out of fear than anything else, which is understandable since the thought of being separated in the middle of a disaster is horrifying.

Some of the most frightening moments take place underground, with the main characters traveling through New York's subway system. Who knows what could be lurking in the dark corners of the tunnels, away from the noise and chaos on the surface? And even if they do make it, what will they find when they emerge? Will there be anything left to find? Will something be waiting to find them? It's this maddening sense of uncertainty that makes ""Cloverfield"" more than just a monster movie rehash: there's genuine suspense coursing all throughout, and for once, it's BECAUSE of the gigantic monster, not IN SPITE of it. You know this is true when Beth's apartment building is finally revealed--it's leaning against a neighboring building like a domino ready to fall.

We occasionally see bursts of old camera footage showing Rob and Beth at Coney Island, which was effective given their current emotional drama. It was also effective for the movie as a whole; I instantly recognized the escapist potential of this film when I saw its first teaser trailer back in July, but even after months of insider rumors and speculation, I never once thought that I'd be using words like ""brilliant"" to describe it. But the reality is that it is brilliant: brilliant as a horror film, brilliant as a thriller, and brilliant as a reinvention of the monster movie. ""Cloverfield"" may actually be one of the greatest monster movies ever made, a taut, unnerving, and completely original fright fest that doesn't lose itself to campy science fiction. It's set a new standard: The monster movie that subsequent monster movies will be compared to.",1200614400,9,5831,4.957055214723926

Hand-held cameras aren't supposed to be hd they're supposed to look rough and realistic so of course the screen will be blurry at times. But the story and the action was put together very good to where you would have been scared even if it was Bambi attacking you. And as far as the unanswered questions like where it came from thats retarded too. This is just supposed to be recovered video footage. Not a whole plotline planned out. So of course all the blanks won't be filled in and if they were that would make the movie completley cheesy and just a joke. Dont expect the best movie of all time but don't expect it to be as bad as people in this post say it is either. I keep seeing all this nonsense about godzilla, this is not a godzilla movie. Godzilla was cheesy and emotional to where he was almost your friend. Not to mention this monster looks very original and nothing like godzilla at all. This monster is scary as hell and ruthless and doesnt get exposed enough to where you get attached to it. And why are people bashing the hand-held camera thing? The preview clearly shows thats how it was filmed so if you hate that then don't go see it, and shut ur mouth. But if ur open to creativity and new movie ideas then youll probly enjoy it.

1589781,2,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield focuses on a group of friends just prior to and after an attack on Manhattan by a giant monster. The entire film is presented as seen from a handheld video camera. As a viewer, you only see and hear what the friends and their camera does, so confusion and ignorance are the order of the day, just as the producers intended.

Many of the basic concepts of Cloverfield were well conceived. Keeping the focus on a small group and seeing things from their perspective helps build suspense and mystery. When you do see it, the monster looks great and is as powerful as you could ask for. There's never any doubt that this thing is incredibly dangerous and scary, and it is not a clone of any previous monsters.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie left a lot to be desired. The video camera is always in motion, often spinning wildly around and around, bobbing, pointing at the ground, pointing at someone's shoes, out of focus, bouncing, and generally doing anything but just letting you lose yourself in the movie for more than a few seconds at a time. The cast is equally annoying as they are both stupid and unlikable even before the attack. The party scene at the beginning drags on for far too long and does little to make viewers care about the group. Once danger starts, they consistently put themselves in harm's way and do things that only a moron would consider.

I wanted to like Cloverfield. I grew up on old monster and always loved them even though I was frustrated by the obvious low quality.

1589782,1,B00005JPXY,"Whatever you do, don't believe the hype.  ""Cloverfield"" is a truly terrible movie, a piece of absolute garbage.  The only reason I gave it one star is that Amazon's rating scale doesn't allow you to give negative (as in below zero) ratings.

The worst part of the movie is the cinematography.  ""Cloverfield"" is shot documentary-style through the point of view of some guy with a video camera.  Not only does it make it impossible to see much of anything clearly, but the camera jerks around so much that it will give motion sickness to even those with the strongest of stomachs.  Whoever thought that such an approach was a good idea was horribly, horribly mistaken.

Even if they had used ""normal"" cinematography, the plot is non-existent.  People bash the 1998 Matthew Broderick version of ""Godzilla"" all the time, but at least there was some semblance of a plot and some sort of explanation for why the monster existed at all.  ""Cloverfield"" offers none of that.  Worse still, there is no attachment between the viewer and the characters--you don't care whether they survive or not, and you know they won't from the very way the movie opens.

All through the movie, I kept thinking, ""Maybe the monster itself will be cool.""  Wrong.  It takes forever for them to show a good shot of it, and when they do, even that is a major disappointment.  All in all, I wish I could recover the money and the hour and a half of my life that I wasted on this movie.",1200614400,23,1453,4.5813953488372094
1589783,4,B00005JPXY,"Basically, this monster flick is a bonafide summer extravaganza masquerading as a wintertime release. And, yes, it's eardrum-busting loud and special effects heavy, but, amazingly CLOVERFIELD also has its deep waters. At a frenetic hour and a half, this film of survival in the face of the unthinkable doesn't have time to get mired in big-budgetism or blockbusteritis. So what we get instead is a taut and compelling pseudo-documentary style monster movie. Kind of. That's actually the backdrop. The film actually is more a focused story on a group of young people attempting to live thru a cataclysmic and unfathomable event. And that's the blessed key right there. CLOVERFIELD doesn't forget about the people, makes you pull for them to come thru okay, makes you all caught up in the throat when they don't. Least it did me.

The film opens innocently enough as a group of young Manhattanites throw a farewell party for their friend, who's spending his last night in New York before he jets out to Japan for his new gig. The next 15 minutes or so clue us in with relevant scenes as we get to know the main characters and what's important to them. But, soon enough, news on television begin to cover an oil tanker just capsized in the New York harbor, and that's the start of it. Then comes the tremor, followed by a power outage. If you've caught the trailer, then you've seen folks scampering out to the roof, then pouring out into the streets, where the crap truly hits the fan.

""People are gonna wanna know how it all went down,"" declares the goofy would-be documentator as he holds fast to his buddy's camcorder and records the next several harrowing hours. It is thru this camcorder that we see this movie, treating us to a ground's eye view of the mounting panic and confusion and noise and fear and just the utter destruction left in the wake of the rampaging whatever-it-is. Because of the camcorder device, raw and shaky and frenetic, and utilized amateurishly enough to be realistic, there's an element of credibility which curtails the cheese factor of a typical monster movie. There's certainly a sense of immediacy here, and a decided impact felt. Bridges collapse, buildings topple, the head of the Statue of Liberty caroms off the side of an edifice, hurtling onto a crowded street. The military do their best, but don't fare too well. And there are other worrisome things out there to fret about, as evidenced by a frightening sequence in the subway tunnels. Reduced to witnessing events at a street level vantage point, pressed in squarely with the frantic victims and onlookers, a palpable feeling of helplessness and insignificance sinks in.

CLOVERFIELD is a disaster movie as experienced thru the eyes of a young group of friends, never mind that the disaster is an unnatural one. No over-the-top heroics here by the cast, no vanquishing the behemoth or saving the city. Situations like this, the things that matter are quickly become well-defined. These Manhattanites are no world savers. They're mere mortals, concerned with personal survival and the survival of their loved ones. The brunt of the plot involves one character who means to brave the warzone to rescue a trapped loved one. His friends are loyal enough to accompany him. And because the movie takes the time to establish its cast, we're right there with them.

Several SPOILERS follow.

Exceptional CG work, of course, with most of the pretend stuff focusing on the wrack and ruin of Manhattan. And how does the monster look? Well, for most of CLOVERFIELD, there are only fleeting peeks at the raging monster, a tail here, a few limbs there, then a blurry shot of what might be the monster's head. Not until almost near the film's end do we get a close-up look of the big honking creature. This is all good, as, personally, the film-long tease ratcheted the suspense way up. I also liked that there wasn't an explanation provided for the monster, what it is, where it came from, all that. And when the closing credits roll around, we're left in the dark regarding the big picture. Was the monster ever vanquished? We know parts of New York are thoroughly devastated, as indicated by the film's introductory on-screen text. But I like that I might never find out. Meanwhile, now and then, we glimpse cutaway sequences of a happier time in the lead character's life (recorded on the same tape in the camcorder). These provide brief and bittersweet counterpoints to all the terror and is a reminder that, despite the f/x and the cool concept and the awesome featured creature, it's the moments of humanity in the film which keeps us invested, and sometimes on a visceral level. Go see this one.

1589784,2,B00005JPXY,"I have to say I wanted to like this movie. Since I saw the first trailers last summer this has been on my ""must see"" list. The viral marketing was interesting and I really thought this would be an incredible hit. Unfortunately, it just doesn't fly like it should have.

Yes, the idea of a movie shot entirely from someone's video camera is a good one...but then you reach those points in the movie when you know there's no way on earth you'd sit there and keep filming while this stuff was going on. Any normal person would drop the camera and run for their lives. And yes, the monster was unique, I'll give points for that. But the point of going to a movie like this is to find out some simple answers: where did the monster come from? Why did it choose New York? What made it attack? These are the questions you START the movie with. They are the same questions you'll END the movie with. The movie ends with such abruptness you'd think the director just said, ""Ok, that's the budget, let's go home.""

There are good qualities too. The movie is genuinely suspenseful at times. The jerky camera movements can give you a headache after a while, but it really gives authenticity to the experience. You feel like you're a part of a real disaster occurring around you. Still, the ending just ruins the movie for me. I felt like I'd watched an episode of a great television show, and I'd be hyped for next week's episode...except there isn't one coming. Makes me a little leery about how Lost is going to end now.

See it if you'd like, but don't expect perfection.",1200614400,15,1562,4.416666666666667
1589785,4,B00005JPXY,"Before I start my review, I feel it is pertinent that you all know that I grew up a Godzilla fanatic. So obviously, Cloverfield was barking up the right tree with this reviewer.

Cloverfield is a difficult movie to figure out. At times, this movie truly entrenches you into a new realm of science fiction monster movies. Cloverfield's style is what Roland Emmerich's Godzilla should have been. Told in a War of the World's fashion, the story is told from the perspective of a bunch of average Joes. No marine biologist or ""worm guys"" in Cloverfield, they react more than often in the exact same ways that the audience would. Michael Stahl - David outshines the rest of the group and actually saves the movie from clich bad acting. Another important element of the film was a use of a nearly invisible script. The actors do, for the most part, seem really be reacting to all of these events.

No science fiction movie is going to be a success without a great monster. This beast is visually stunning and very refreshing in a genre that is most of the time by the book. Without revealing too much, there are also little creatures that play a huge role within the movie as well. Much like Jaws, the movie relies a lot of quick appearances and over powering dominance on the NYC. Too many monster movies depend on showing the monster non stop to show its monstrosity, but inherently, the more a monster is shown, the more flaws that are revealed. Describing what the monster looks like would only be an injustice to the reader. As a monster fan, I would not do that to you.

The difficulty within the movie is the fact that darn handheld camera is both the movie's greatest accomplishment and greatest crutch. Its style really helps you connect with some of the characters and feel stuck with the group. The hand held camera also allows the monster and its critters to be more threatening because of their lack of detail. Like any movie that is based on hand held camera use, the style wears out its welcome very early in the movie. About 45 minutes in, motion sickness medicine doesn't sound like such a bad idea. Another problem with the hand held camera is who is holding the camera. T.J. Miller's ""Hud"" had to be one of the most annoying characters to give such a prominent role. His efforts of comic relief are both unrealistic and worst of all not very funny. I was cheering for him to be killed the entire movie.

Overall, I would say the good outweighs the bad with a great monster and great effects. I would rank it as just as good or better than last year's sleeper, The Host. J.J. Abrams said in an interview that he was visiting Japan with his son and stopped by a toy store, and they were bombarded with Godzilla toys. J.J. decided America needed it's own monster. Unlike the cuddly King Kong, J.J. wanted to create something unrelenting and very insane. I would say for the most part that he succeeded.",1200614400,,2912,4.530418250950571
1589786,2,B00005JPXY,"This is by far the most over-hyped movie I've seen ever. No wonder they made this movie mysterious in the beginning of last year. There's no real story here. I thought this movie was going to be a spin off of Lost series after the SWAN hatch imploded at the end of season 2 possibly releasing a part of the ""Black Smoke Monster"". A lot of other Lost fans thought so also. But I highly doubt that. It's just another re-hashed monster flick where some giant creature trashes Manhattan Island. Instead of the perspective of Army and Marine grunts, Air Force pilots, and scientists, it takes the perspective of a bunch of young yuppie New Yorkers as they try to survive the monster and fight off it's bug like minions They're probably like remoras on sharks or small birds on rhinos. We don't get an explanation of what the monster is or what its little bug looking minions are doing when they bite someone. The monster doesn't even look like the old Japanese Godzilla or the new American Godzilla from 1998. It's not H.P. Lovecraft's Call of Cthulhu or Voltron. Everyone has seen this type Monster movie before. There's nothing new in this film. It'll probably end up in the Svengoolie show on Saturday night. So don't waste your money on this movie in the weekend. In the later half of the movie after we discover that it was indeed a monster, I was rooting for it to eat the people up, bite their heads off, and tear up the L-trains and subway trains like King Kong and eat the transit riders up like a bag of Jelly Beans and M&Ms. The ending was very ridiculous. At least Beth and her ex-boyfriend should have survived and live happily ever after. The title was also corny. I thought ""Cloverfield"" was the code word for the movie not the actual title. They should have came up with a better title like ""Escape from New York part 2"", ""Mars Attack 2: their pet left behind"", or ""It Came from the Sewers"".",1200614400,18,1902,4.468390804597701
1589787,3,B00005JPXY,"When one thinks of ""Cloverfield"" the awesome ""hyped-up"" trailer comes to mind. The teaser trailer was very well-marketed and does grab our attention. J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible, Lost)definitely knows how to arouse the curiosity and attention of moviegoers. Now, the only problem with hyping up a film so much is that it either works or it doesn't. Hype can definitely work in putting people on theater seats but once word gets out that the film is ""anything but..."". Well, again, kudos to the producers who thought of the gimmick.

The film's premise is looked at from the scope of POV of a DV camera during the farewell party for one bound for Japan executive Rob (Michael Stahl David). Suddenly, an unknown force rocks Manhattan. Wild fear and panic ensues as the military attempts to stop the gigantic menace on its path of destruction. Rob and a group of partygoers attempt to navigate through the city to save Rob's one true love; Beth. They find little hope as the rampage of the ""unknown"" force blocks all exits.

""Blair Witch Project"" anyone? Yes, the film takes on the camera style of the hugely successful horror film. Director Matt Reeves uses a single DV camera to take the audience into the heart of a monster film. Cloverfield is an ambitious film, it tries to escape from the usual clichs and stereotypes that have plagued monster films before. Sadly, while the style did work for ""Blair Witch"", this film came off a little short. I do commend the producers for trying to widen the scope of a very limited premise in resorting to the video camera to emulate raw panic and fear. What made ""Blair Witch"" stand out was its ability to delve into the emotion of the unknown and the unexplained. ""The Mist"" already explored the unknown and while the ""Cloverfield"" does have a lot of emotions involved in the proceedings, I tend to look at things a bit differently. The gigantic monster is shown from time to time through the camera, and frankly it looks like the monster came from ""The Mist"". Even the once-again, spider-like creatures looked like they came from the aforementioned film by Frank Darabont.

""Cloverfield"" does attempt something different, the routes it took seem so ineffective. The film tries to give the viewer the feeling of REALITY through the video camera, but somehow, it fumbles its premise halfway through. It still fell to the usual clichs inherent in a sci-fi monster film: display of military might, evacuation and panic, a love-sick hero with unexpressed love, dwindling hope, death and destruction, the usual heroics. The film employs obvious editing tricks to attempt to give the backstory of Beth and Rob's romance with the camera acting screwy that it rewinds from time to time. The film tries its best to make something so groundbreaking with a monster premise and while its producers/directors' hearts are in the correct place, the film's execution becomes nauseating. Quite frankly, the DV camera feels more like a ""GIMMICK"" than a REAL INHERENT part of the film. In ""Blair Witch"", at least, the characters are lost in the woods and they wish that a DV camera may give some light to what happens to them, which makes the video camera relevant.

After all, who can hold a camera while your friends are being attacked? Why pick up the camera again after you drop it after you get attacked? (A metal bar would be more viable) Why hold on to the camera when you are scaling a tipped over rooftop? What kind of MORONIC stupidity is it for someone to keep on recording what is happening under the shadow of raw panic and hysteria? What kind of insensitivity is it to keep a dumb camera in play in the face of your friends' suffering? In REALITY, time is of the essence and the survival of your friends are the most important. REALITY dictates the video camera to be thrown aside for survival. After all is said and done, in this situation, the video camera is a useless piece of recording; for in REALITY, the whole world would know when a 200+ ft. monster is attacking a city. The camera needed to be turned off!

To its credit, at the very least, there are some intense and scary moments in the film that are reminiscent of classic invasion films. The special effects are nicely done and the movie is indeed loud. The explosions are felt and pure destruction does save parts of the film. There is also some blood and gore. (although some of it happens off camera) I sure wished that the military encounters with the giant creature and the spider things were more explored. Actually, it would have done well if it was a reporter's first-person perspective who captured the footage of a heated encounter. Unfortunately, the director depends on crude humor and serious attempts at a sob story to generate sympathy. The film requires a large suspension of disbelief that contradicts its atmosphere to emulate a feeling of reality.

Ultimately, ""Cloverfield"" could have survived without the single video camera gimmick. It could have just stuck to the basics of a monster film and still turned in a generous box-office take. Its attempts to emulate ""REALITY"" in the first person view may be its strength but its execution is also its greatest weakness. The pure ""gimmick"" of a single video camera tries to give the viewer a first-person view and/or spectator's point of view is an attempt to hide the hollow plot that it could have just as well be a spin-off of the far superior film; ""The Mist"". If you think about it, ""Cloverfield"" is what is happening in New York when ""The Mist"" took place in that small town. I am certain that this film will have its following who will say there is a deeper context and hidden subtle details where there is none. It does have the message of ""seizing the moment"", life is short, and love is powerful.

But the next time someone says it is so original and groundbreaking, ask yourself this: How would I feel if a friend kept running around shooting a camera while we're running for our lives? Just enjoy it for what it is, a typical monster flick and it happens in New York again.
In truth, The Korean hit monster-family film; ""The Host"" and Darabont's ""The Mist"" is a lot better. Heck, at least, ""Cloverfield"" was better than the U.S. made ""Godzilla"" movie....

It's ok, nothing spectacular but will definitely appeal to some. [3 stars]",1200614400,3,6314,4.733636363636363
1589788,3,B00005JPXY,"Cloverfield (2008) - Matt Reeves

Going into the movie, I was not expecting anything out of the ordinary, which is ridiculous in itself considering the movie is anything but ordinary in its conception.  Actually, to be more specific, the plot itself is extremely banal, and I could honestly care less for most of the characters.  What is in fact most unique about the film, and by far its most interesting ""character"", is the hand held camera.  By basically viewing the action through the eyes of the holder of the camera for the duration of the film, the audience literally becomes a part of the action.  In fact, ideally, we feel everything the characters feel: their fears, hopes, excitement, etc.  However, unfortunately, the film has a few major flaws that, I feel, prevent it from achieving the status of a truly great movie.  Instead, it ends up becoming an extremely interesting diversion.

First of all, and this is the problem with a lot of movies that are extremely ""gimmicky"", the gimmick is TOO much the focus.  In other words, developments in the plot happen not due to character, which is how it should be, but seemingly only for the sake of coolness.  What ends up happening is the plot and characters end up feeling contrived, cliche, and even relatively light.  And when I say ""for the sake of coolness"", I mean that when a specific plot point occurs, what I feel is happening in the director's mind is ""Oh, it would be cool to have the characters do this, so that the audience can experience this, too.""  The problem with that concept is that in its execution, a lot of the plot points end up inevitably weak, at least in the context of the film.  For example, Rob saving Beth is relatively ridiculous because as an audience member, you never feel that they truly loved each other in the first place.  In other words, the only reason to have Rob save her, and to have Hud (the holder of the camera) follow, is to lengthen the effect of the gimmick, which is an obvious tactic because the film is relatively short in duration.  Therefore, what ends up ultimately happening is that Cloverfield, instead of being a truly great film, ends up being a lesser film filled with great moments.  And yes, it has a few truly great moments.  I refer specifically to the first sequence that starts with the explosion that the characters witness from the balcony and ends with the flying head of the Statue of Liberty.  The helicopter flight to escape the city is an example of another fantastic sequence.

So, overall, the movie is definitely a worthwhile watch, and I recommend it without hesitation.  Just do not expect anything more than a visceral thrill ride, and you will be fine.  Oh, and do beware that the camera movement can be extremely jarring and potentially nauseating.
