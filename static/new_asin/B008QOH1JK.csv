8529626,5,B008QOH1JK,"To the lady who wrote that Tarzan isn't even in it (ha ha), she must not have known that in the 1960s ""Climb it, Tarzan"" was a slang expression that meant (basically) ""Screw off!""

Anyway, I thought this movie had a bevy of beautiful ladies (many scantily clad or not clad at all), a cool production design, innovative direction by Jared Masters, and excellent attention to period detail. ""Climb It, Tarzan!"" is a great throwback to the movies of Russ Meyer, Lewis H. Gordon, Albert Thomas, Joe D'Amato, Jess Franco, Tinto Brass, et al.

So if you (like me) loved the campy exploitation and sexploitation (a sub-genre of exploitation movies) B-movies of the 1960s, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out!",1355875200,4,712,4.733870967741935
8529627,1,B008QOH1JK,"Terrible terrible movie. Don't waste your money. It's not even worth buying to make fun of. It's just bad. Buy something else.
If you want something thats bad to make fun of, try a HeMan Christmas special. thats so bad its funny! Where Climb it Tarzan is just plain bad.
Seek elsewhere for entertainment.",1355875200,,304,4.648148148148148

You want eight more words to tell you how bad it was.",1355616000,,113,3.75
