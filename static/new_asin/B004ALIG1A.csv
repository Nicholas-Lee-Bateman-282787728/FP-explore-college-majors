Funny and sweet.",1383091200,,136,5.2272727272727275
8420432,5,B004ALIG1A,"The way the daughter learns to accept her father, the way he learns to accept change & go w/ it, the acceptance of gays by his homophobic teammate all go a long way to making this story a keeper.  I have lent it out to all kinds of people & it has not failed yet to win them over.  It is humanity in a small box!",1379548800,,312,3.712121212121212

8420434,4,B004ALIG1A,"Well made, simple, escape film from Sweden.

It was not made to be the second coming of Citizen Kane. Yet, there are great perspectives on parenthood, competition, sexism, sport, relationships, friendships, homophobia, and other social issues.

At some point this film went from an escape ""movie"" to something with care, heart and soul!

Swimsuit Issue is a fun ride.

In the end, we are immersed in the film and we want to see more!

GREAT JOB!",1303862400,,445,4.802631578947368
8420435,5,B004ALIG1A,"""The Swimsuit Issue"", the latest film from Swedish director Mans Herngren, was a big hit at last year's Tribeca Film Festival.  I was hoping to see it in U.S. distribution.  It has a fine and original story line -- a group of thirty-something guys lose their arena hockey playing space and switch sports to fit what space is available.  It happens to be a swimming pool; and the new sport for the disenfranchised aging jocks is synchronized swimming.  A lot of grief follows as the sport is rarely practiced by men and for most, a masculine form just doesn't provide the same level of grace and beauty that the women's sport does.  For the guys on the new team--a disparate group that has more slackers than hotshots--it becomes a matter of pride and way to prove to themselves and their families that they are not chronic losers.

The film has a lot of heart and humor.  Director Herngren skillfully gets the best out of a very good cast and avoids the slapstick and melodrama that could have torpedoed the story line.  While the film has a recognizably Swedish context, its appeal is universal and should be popular with any audience.  Recommended.",1292457600,3,1150,4.681592039800995
8420436,4,B004ALIG1A,"I found this story to be an enjoyable adventure, but not an adventure in the sense of fantasy, no, a modern adventure with a group of people changing -or challenging- the social norms within their country. The story's beginning was somewhat slow and I wasn't sure how I felt about it but about halfway through and especially while looking back I would recommend this film, for I did enjoy it.
