8225479,5,B000WTO4HO,Solid video...lil fast paced... But packed with lots of techniques. And NOT boring like most fishing instructional videos,1419811200,,121,5.777777777777778
8225480,5,B000WTO4HO,"Great movie  for those wanting to fish Golden Trout wilderness and Kern River Drainage, a must have to see the beautiful journey to great upper Kern Fishing.",1401926400,,157,4.814814814814815
8225481,5,B000WTO4HO,Guy Jeans deliver's some great information with an excellent dash of humor.  Perfect for anyone planning to travel to this area and do some fishing.,1397433600,,148,4.92
8225482,2,B000WTO4HO,"Nicely filmed, but be warned--this short video doesn't really doesn't tell you much about the Kern River at all, just how to use four different techniques on it. A first time visitor to the Kern would probably have to hire this guy as a guide to figure out the spots he was fishing.

It would have been better if they would have shown some maps of the area relative to other features nearby; they could have discussed what times of the year are best--things like that. If they'd have spent at least an hour and discussed some of those things, it would have been way more useful.

I am glad I bought a used copy from an Amazon vendor--otherwise I would have felt pretty ripped off.",1337644800,,680,4.388888888888889
8225483,4,B000WTO4HO,"This movie is incredibly informative and wonderfully filmed. The fishing action is covered in tremendous detail without giving up the ""treasured"" spots to the masses. If you want specific details, you can call the fly shop, but knowing your prey and catching is covered in detail.
If you're looking for GPS coordinates, this won't help a lot, but to the thousands of people that fish this river regularly, it is a pleasure to watch. Highly recommended and truly a well edited piece of film work.
Thank you Guy and Tysun for your incredible work.",1246320000,2,545,4.808510638297872
8225484,1,B000WTO4HO,"The video is short and covers 3 techniques that can easily be learned through reading about setting up their fly rods. I did not learn anything from this video that I was hoping too. There is no direction as to where to fish on the lower Kern River but only images of the host fishing an area he deems as a good spot without any reference to where the area is. The lower Kern River runs 40 miles and there is nothing that provides which stretches to fish or anything. If you are looking for details about where to fish on the Kern, this video does not provide that. If you are looking for what is working on the Kern, call the fly shop. If you are looking for a ""how to"" video, go to youtube.",1240358400,3,692,4.095588235294118
8225485,5,B000WTO4HO,"Wow!!! Even if this DVD wasn't made by my very talented son Tysun McMullan,  I would really be impressed .... I have never fished the Kern River but, because of the excellent production, I am ready to go see for myself. The video makes you feel like your are there. Shot with love and care, this inspiring film is not only instructional, it is filled with the beauty of the area as well.  The flyfishing guide, Guy Jeans is personable and knowledgable about the area and Tysun McMullan does a fine job of capturing the scenic beauty of the Kern River. I have seen lots of flyfishing videos in my day and they are often flat and sometimes boring. This one is alive and full of vitality.. Even if you are not a fisherman, you will enjoy the scenic and artistic value in this amazing video.  Great original music... I think you have made a classic fly fishing film. I look forward to the next one.",1195948800,,894,4.373493975903615
