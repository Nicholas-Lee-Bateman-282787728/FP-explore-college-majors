8531031,5,B008VL05LE,"I have loved this version since I was a kid and was glad to find it streaming here! Tracey Ullman's narration, especially in her hyperbolic French accent, is funny and strange. I think it's a good test for kids today to watch after living in a world of hyper-real Pixar/Disney/Dreamworks productions. There is no animation, just a panning across of illustration. It is simple and lovely.",1398816000,2,387,4.878787878787879
8531032,1,B008VL05LE,Poor quality. Poor narration. The kids thought it was boring. Didn't even make it through the whole film. Don't bother.,1389225600,,119,5.0
