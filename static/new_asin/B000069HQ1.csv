1733046,2,B000069HQ1,"Oh yeah! I forgot to laugh when the guy does something with the eyes. Jeez! Give me a break. If this was an attempt to make a really funny Teen Comedy, heck it failed. The acting is okay, but the theme is really poor which eventually leads to the downside of the entire movie. I mean check this out. A high school kid, is a no-body in his prior school and suddenly becomes a somebody in his new one, by doing really stupid stuff, like poking kids in the eyes,and doing something weird with his own. I really Admire Tony Hawk but his intervention in this movie really has no meaning! Overall, a very corny movie with a very corny theme!!",1029283200,2,636,4.264462809917355
1733047,2,B000069HQ1,"THis movie had such potential, and the first half hour ior so is actually quite entertaining.  But beyond that this tale of Rags to Riches fails to impress beyonf that.  The antics of Dizzy Harrison proves to be monotonouse.  I mean the stereo typical bully who girl friend ditches him, the best friends who break apart and than get together in the end.  The fact that he is revealed for what he is in the end and ends up with the girl anyways this is a been there done that re hash of so many things in the past.  Further proof that an origional idea can go so wrong with so many things to steal from out there.
If you want an origional comedy that truely satisfyes than go for Super Troopers, but beyond that don't waste your time with this.",1028678400,,743,4.24113475177305
1733048,5,B000069HQ1,"I went into ""The New Guy"" on May 10 (opening day) not really expecting a lot. To be honest, I was afraid it would end up as another ""Meet The Parents"" or ""Dude, Where's My Car ?"", movies that looked really funny in their respective trailers, yet they turned out to have had all their really excellently funny moments spoiled by those same trailers. I feared the same fate for ""The New Guy."" Still, it stars Eliza Dushku, and that reason alone gave me the courage to give it a fair chance. And, I gotta tell ya, it was really a pleasant surprise ! It stars DJ Qualls as Dizzy, a member of a rock/funk band and the kid everyone picks on at his high school. One thing leads to another, and he ends up in jail with Eddie Griffin (""Armageddon,"" ""Undercover Brother""), who shows him how to really get people to notice him, this time for the better. He shows up at a rival high school and quickly becomes recognized as the coolest guy there. Eventually, he catches the eye of the head cheerleader (Eliza Dushku), and the two hit it off really well. Of course, when you're new and have everyone's attention, those who used to rule the school are bound to get jealous and look for any kind of dirt they can find on you. Again, this movie was a big surprise for me, especially the skimpy outfits Eliza Dushku wears, and I will be so bold as to label it one of the most fun movie experiences of the year. Perhaps most surprising of all is the ending, which will catch first-time viewers off guard and likely send them falling from their chairs with laughter, and is perfect for the kind of movie that ""The New Guy"" is. Rated PG-13, it does not have as much foul language as other teen comedies like ""American Pie,"" but it does contain scenes of serious injuries to a man's most personal area. A definite must-see for fans of comedies and of actress Eliza Dushku, who is looking as hot as ever.",1028592000,4,1882,4.349431818181818
1733049,1,B000069HQ1,"Teen comedy has become much of a hit-and-miss proposition, but this really takes the miss factor to a new level, making me miss the likes of SHE'S ALL THAT. The gags here are rarely funny, just mostly tedious and/or cruel. For those of us who had any school social difficulties, it's just hard to watch, with virtually no reward for hanging in. Hopefully NOT the wave of the future!",1027641600,2,382,4.550724637681159
1733050,2,B000069HQ1,"If you enjoy movies in the ""teen melodrama"" genre, The New Guy is actually pretty decent. The story, about a teen who rebuilds his image with the help of a prison inmate, has a constant feel-good vibe to it. The script is occasionally funny with deliberate nods to the cliches of the genre, and is sometimes plain bizzare. DJ Qualls is a likeable lead, without the arrogance of most actors who take these roles. And of course, there's Eliza Dushku, the main reason I saw this movie in the first place. She's beautiful, talented, and her swimsuit montage is definitely the movie's highlight! Hopefully though, she'll find more ambitious projects in the future.
So I liked The New Guy, but I still can't recommend it. For the movies few original moments, the rest of the stuff still feels pretty cliched and predictable. Worse than that, the movie is badly filmed, without the lively colors or brightness of She's All That, Bring it On, or American Pie. It has an amateurish look, and this is what really hurts the film. There are many plot holes, like how Qualls and Eddie Griffin can move around so freely in prison. While this might have been a deliberate gag, it feels more like sloppy writing. The gags are simply okay; they're funny to the point where you might find yourself smiling a lot, but few go the extra distance and make you truly laugh out loud.
Worse still, the DVD looks like a bare-bones effort. If the DVD had included some good bonus features (com'on, there HAS to be outtakes of Eliza Dushku from the swimsuit scene!), I would have gladly added another star. If more bonus features are revealed later, then consider another star added and my full recommendation to buy, but as it stands the movie by itself is not worth the cost on DVD. If you're an Eliza Dushku fan, like I am, then the movie *is* worth the cost, but ONLY after rigorous price-comparison shopping.
This DVD should only be purchased by Eliza Dushku fans, though since the film is moderately fun in a non-sensical way, everyone else should at least give it a rental.",1026518400,,2052,4.624657534246575

1733252,4,B000069HQ1,"This movie has not aged quite as gracefully as some of its peers from the same genre and time period, but it still has its merits. There are worthy performances here from DJ Qualls, Eddie Griffin (as a crazy-eyed inmate), and a young Zoey Deschanel. The jokes and premise have grown a bit stale, and I could see how heavily influenced this movie was by the heavy hitters of its time (like the ""American Pie"" series, for instance). Nonetheless, there is actually a very heartwarming story buried in this (presumably) low budget teen comedy, about being true to oneself and loving that person, as opposed to being consumed with gaining the approval of others. And this movie was actually a bit before its time, because it aggressively addresses the issue of high school bullying, rightly condemning it.

However, this just isn't a laugh-out-loud movie, when compared to the best of its peers during the early 2000s (with top honors going to ""Not Another Teen Movie"", which has oddly proven to be rather timeless). I certainly got some enjoyment out of it, and I think others who were in high school/college during the filming of ""The New Guy"" will also be able to glean some nostalgic value from it (wow, that wonky soundtrack takes me back).

Final notes: There are some downright bizarre cameos which I enjoyed, including Vanilla Ice, who has been driven to violence, and Tony Hawk, who is desperate to show off his skateboarding skills. If nothing else, it can certainly be said that this is most likely the only film in which will we ever see Lyle Lovitt take a flaming marshmallow to the eye (yes, that actually happens)!",1364774400,,1624,4.75531914893617
1733253,5,B000069HQ1,"I love this movie. It is very very funny. If you enjoy comedies you will enjoy this movie. The film tells the story of high school loser Dizzy Gillespie Harrison. Dizzy is an unpopular, high school band geek going through a hellish senior year. In an attempt to make a new identity for himself, Dizzy gets himself expelled from his high school, learns how to be cool from a prison inmate, and enrolls at a new high school under the alias Gil Harris. He is quick to make new friends and soon gains respect from jocks and geeks alike, uniting a once divided school and greatly improving its football team. Eventually, Gil has to face his demons from his old school when they face each other in a football game.",1335139200,,708,4.453846153846154
1733290,5,B000069HQ1,"I originally rented this movie because Eliza Dushku was in it. I loved her in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I even liked her in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. So, I rented The New Guy, expecting Eliza Dushku to pretty much be the only good thing about this movie.

Boy was I wrong.

DJ Qualls is excellent as the teen that starts off as the nerd who seems helpless to stop being victimized and humiliated by his peers in high school and transforms himself into a strong, confident, masterful teenager who can look after himself. Eddie Griffin is great in his role as the scary (but helpful) prison convict who teaches DJ everything he needs to know to survive, succeed, thrive and strike fear into the hearts of his enemies in high school. It's not realistic. It's far too outrageous for that.

Quite a few of the techniques that DJ learns wouldn't work in the real world, (like making entire crowds of people flinch when you give them a crazy look) but that's not really what this movie is about! This is one of the ultimate feel good movies! This is a movie about a guy who started off at the bottom of the food chain and made his way to the top! It's a movie about a guy who went from under-dog to over-dog! It's a movie about a pathetic nobody and re-invented himself to become the most popular kid at school!

If nothing else the soundtrack is pretty cool.  The amount of interesting gues stars is fun to track & you'll get a recap in the end credits.

There certainly isn't much here that is going to make you go gaga (unless we're talking about Eliza Dushku) but there are some genuine laughs here, especially from DJ Qualls who is one of those people that is just plain funny to look at.  Qualls plays a dork who is belittled and accosted at his school rather regularly until he is briefly jailed for misbehavior and given a mental makeover by a fellow inmate.  Upon release he tries out his new persona at a different school with surprising results until a bully attempts to uncover his past.  Aside from Qualls unattractiveness and Dushku's hotness, there isn't much to write home about.  Some of the gags work very well while the majority feel stale and or just not very well thought out.

What could have been a huge dud turns out to be surprisingly funny and charming because of a good cast, an energetic soundtrack and a few differences in the clichd story line. The quirky DJ Qualls in the title role gives an enthusiastic performance and cutie pie Zooey Deschanel is always a treat. If you like these types of films, this one is much better than I expected it to be. It's not original, but it is a charming entry in the genre.

1733330,3,B000069HQ1,"I remember my first time I changed schools when I was young.  It was hard, it was emotional, and by George, I never quite think I ever turned back into the boy I once was.  Changing schools is hard when you are young - or at any age - but was the film ""The New Guy"", clich ridden from the beginning throughout the end, needed to help those under-privileged tweens prepare themselves for a choice they probably had no decision in?  Why I am rambling instead of immediately jumping in why so many others denounced this film?  To be honest, and this will probably shock you, I felt a soft spot for this film.  It could have been the multitude of cameos.  Maybe it was the shockingly impassioned DJ Qualls, or maybe it was the fact that this reminded me of a different time in cinema where movies were made to just be funny.  ""The New Guy"" felt like one part ""Can't Hardly Wait"", one part ""Empire Records"", with one part actually feeling like a dud Pauley Shore movie.  You probably hate me already, but these elements clicked with me.  Now, this wasn't Oscar-caliber in any way shape or form, but it did hold my attention, made me chuckle, and made me appreciate classic 90s (early 00s) tween comedy.

The plot surrounding this film could be found anywhere.  Qualls plays Dizzy Harrison, a nobody determined to be someone this year in school.  A debacle - of which will not be mentioned - sends him screaming to the nurses office and eventually into jail.  It is during his moments of detention that he meets with Luther (the low-point of the film Eddie Griffin), who teaches him to act like he is a different person.  It sticks, Dizzy goes to another school under the pseudonym of Gil Harris - wins the hearts of the students, a hot cheerleader named Danielle (Eliza Dushku), and nearly looses all of his friends.  Will he be able to live the high life he has created, or will his past catch up to him?  If you cannot answer this question, it is obvious you need to start watching more movies.  Like I said when I started this, the plot isn't something you want to spend your Sunday writing to Grandma about - it is the passion of the characters, the enthusiasm of the creators, and the easy-going spirit of the film that actually hooked me more than I anticipated.  I liked the jokes.  I liked laughing at Lyle Lovett getting hit in the eye with a flaming marshmallow, I liked the fact that Vanilla Ice was playing a FYE-esque employee with a mean streak, and I loved whenever those O'Connell boys were on the screen.  Something about these moments took me back when comedies prided themselves on weak plots and cameos galore.  One could almost say this was a precursor to the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, except better executed.

The plot is feeble.  That has been established already.  The plot wasn't bad, it was just clich ridden to the point where you could care less what was going to happen (because it was predictable prior to it happening), but wanted to see our characters - Qualls, Dushku, Deschanel, Lovett, O'Connell, and more (Gene Simmons as a Reverend?) - were headed.  I can't say that I loved the characters, but they kept my attention on screen more than I thought.  I think what impressed me about this film was that it didn't rely on crass body humor to progress the plot, the jokes (while weak) did have some moments of creativity to them.  Someone tried to give this film a cult standing, but failed - but not without going out fighting.  I applaud this attempt.  The characters worked well together.  Whether you were waiting for another priceless cameo or just watching Qualls bumble around Dushku, I was following it.  This combination was perfect with a cool beverage, a warm evening, and a desire to laugh.  There wasn't any high level of expectation - and I think that is where ""The New Guy"" succeeded.  It knew where it wanted to be, and it didn't strive to go further.  I have been hesitant to see ""Borat"" because of the hype that everyone applauds to it, so in this instance the bar has been set too high.  For ""The New Guy"", I knew very little about it outside of the previews that I had seen in other films for this one.  I didn't want to see this movie, but when it arrived, I wasn't scared to put it in my DVD player.  I was happy.  This was a chuckle filled film.

Another element that I really enjoyed was the parody connection.  ""The New Guy"" parodied other films of that year (or older/younger) and you just don't see that anymore.  Outside of the obvious parody films that have been released lately (shall we never speak of ""Epic Movie"" again), Hollywood tends to avoid this in modern cinema, but for this critic is has always made me laugh.  Why do you think I own ""The Critic"" series?  I thought this really enforced this film's standard - again - without going over the preset bar, it brought a new level of comedy to the surface and writer David Kendall coupled with the direction of Ed Decter did a great job of keeping performances low, cameos high, and intelligence mediocre.  There was a level of understanding that this was a decent film, but it didn't want the general public to know it.

Overall, I could complain about the bad parts of this film all day, I could also speak highly of other parts that I just seemed to cobble up like leftover cake, but I am not.  I will suggest this film to friends and family, let them be grumpy with me for a bit, but I liked this movie.  It is not one that will be added to my collection, but for the time and place that I am currently at ""The New Guy"" hit the spot.  Qualls isn't the greatest comedian, but his comic timing is genuine.  His matching with Dushku was preposterous and we all knew, but we went along anyway because it was a comfortable clich.  I like the comfortable clichs.

Don't skip it, but don't knock it till you see it.  Surprise yourself.

Dizzy Harrison(Qualls)is a loser and having a terrible senior year. He gets himself expelled by doing some crazy and fairly entertaining acts. He gets trained by his prsion inmated(led by Eddie Griffin)and sets off to his new high school to rule it. He quickly does and falls for the lead cheerleader Danielle(Dushku). She has a thing for ""Gil Harris"" as he's known at his new school. The movie then becomes the cliche teen movie it is as Dizzy is faced with the moral problem of being who he really is or losing everything he's worked so hard for. Geesh I wonder how it ends.

I like DJ Qualls. He's such a weird looking guy you can't help but like him. His best movie is still Roadtrip, but he does alright in his leading role here. His dancing is pretty hilarious. He's a funny guy and doesn't disappoint.

Eliza Dushku is gorgeous. Her dancing for her two minutes makes the movie for me. She's likeable as well. She's kind of a stiff in this flick, but that can be blamed on the poor writing.

It's a fun predictable movie. It's not as raunchy as alot of the teen movies so younger crowds can watch it. It's a good movie I'm not embarrased to say I own it. Check it out and enjoy yourself.",1168387200,2,1347,4.270588235294118

The cameos, as it has been said in other reviews make this movie stand out a little more than say Mean Girls or American Pie. Gene Simmons as a Baptist Preacher, Vanilla Ice as a record store clerk, Lyle Lovitt as the Blip's dad, and Henry Rollins as the Jailhouse Warden do give this flick an edge. Seeing Lyle Lovitt getting shot in the eye with a flaming marshmellow is almost worth the cost of admission.

However there is one thing that needs to be pointed out that no other reviewer has said. Everyone likes the cheerleaders, but I think the hottest babe in the movie was the red-headed school doctor. What a cutie with those pig-tails. She is a red hot mama and if I was the dad, I would have made my move.

Yes some of the humor is low brow. I mean what librarian anywhere would grab it, hold on to it, and say ""It's mine now!"".

Now that those weirdos are gone, let me tell you why I love The New Guy.  This movie isn't very good, and that is its strongest point.  It exists to make fun of teen melodramas with a great assembly of random guest stars, completely mediocre cinematography, some movie mocking moments, and general randomness.  This movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and neither should you.  The whole thing is like a litany of ""When really odd people do odd things and more odd random things happen to them"".  If this sounds like you, someone you know, or someone you used to be, then you'll enjoy this movie.  If you can relax, have no expectations, and just let it flow I garentee you'll spend the film doubled over.  It features over the top geeks like a midget tuba player, a couple ugly-pretty girls, a fat black kid, and a greasy haired Asian guy.  The soundtrack adds to every humorous moment by sounding like an Oscar winner meeting a NOW thats what I call music CD.  Most of the guest stars are not big names, but that one guy from that one 80's band or that one tv show.  And they pop up in the most random places, like Lyle Loveitt with a marshmellow burning in his face and Jermiane Dupri's excellent delivery of ""whose the [...] now?"".  DJ Qualls does a wonderful job in the title role although you're probably going ""who the heck is DJ Qualls?"".  Eliza Dushku is hot hot hot.

Gil Harris is a not so typical High School geek.  He plays funk music with a band of fellow outcasts calling themselves blips, as in radar blips.  When he is humiliated at school the first day of his senior year, he flips at a mall, and is put in jail for the night.  Where he meets his anti-hero mentor, the hillarious Eddie Griffith.  There he has an epiphanie, high school is a lot like prison.  So if he treats it like prison, he will survive.  So he gets kicked out of High School, and creates a bad boy persona.  Not only does he survive, but he thrives, becoming the most popular kid in high school.

The story isn't anything new, a nerd learns he is strong and becomes popular, but it doesn't follow lame pc and sensitive story ideas.  The humor is twisted and warped, but not overly crude or mean spirited.  The casting was near perfect, and the acting good all around.

Sure, the story is lame.  But DJ Qualls has the quirky charm he had in Road Trip.  Eliza Dushku probably could have starred in a much better indie flick.

This is a relic of the 80s that was made 15 years too late. It's been years since I've seen a movie so predictable, so idiotic and so formulistic. Its concepts of social behavior and teen life are so old fashioned and pathetically prototypical, the makers of Saved By The Bell would have laughed. Fine, you say. It's just a stupid comedy. It doesn't have to be smart. But hell, at least make it funny! There were maybe two or three good jokes throughout the whole thing. A couple of decent actors (Eddie Griffin wasn't bad, and Zooey Deschanel is strangely charming) and some good cameos (Tommy Lee, David Hasslelhoff, Vanilla Ice) don't make up for a lousy script, a pathetic lead actor and bland, uninspired directing (the line - directed by a co-writer of There's Something About Mary should tell you all you need to know).

However a  guardian angel of sorts appears in the guise of a prisoner named Luther (Eddie Griffin). With Luther's expert guidance Dizzy gets himself expelled from school (For the mortal sin of purposely snapping a mop in half. Oh my, how anti-social); and with an image makeover Dizzy begins afresh at a new school as ""Gil Harris""- the Baddest Mofo on campus- complete with a new 'do that's described by Luther as 'Brad Pitt in ""Fight Club"" crossed with Anne Heche in ""If These Walls Could Talk""'. Scary.
With Dizzy/Gil's revamped image comes  a newfound confidence- and what guy wouldn't possess that if he were suddenly warranting the attention of the hottest girls in school?- BUT on the downside shallowness, fakery, and rejection of his old (and true) friends. Any fool can guess what the outcome of this CINDERELLA-esque story will be.

DJ Qualls is ""The New Guy"" - Dizzy.  But before he becomes the New Guy of West-Highland High, he's just one of many brutalized nerds at another school (a sure sign that the guys who write these sophomoric rants aren't exactly bowled by the tragedy at Columbine anymore).  After a catastrophic episode of bullying involving Dizzy's genitals and his school's 80 year old librarian, Dizzy manages to get sent to prison, where his love of funk music earns him the odd friendship of Luther (Eddie Griffin).  Released from prison, Dizzy is remade into Gil, with a different hair and clothing style, but still essentially the same guy.  Utterly unknown at his new school, and with the help of the geeky friends that sing funk with him, Dizzy sets out to become the ultimate delinquent, get the girl and conquer the jocks at his new school.  Relying on pluck, but mostly dumb luck, Dizzy/Gil suceeds, or is meant to long enough for his past to come back to haunt him.  In the meantime, his maverick ways energize the school - which hasn't won a football game in 5 years (since the President's father....was president) - to become a focal point of goodness (instead of lions lying down with the lamb, geek and jock coexist without serious injury - to the geek side anyway; and friends who haven't exchanged a word since the gap of coolness became a chasm between them, reunite).
Beside from the obligatory sexual suggestions, and forgetting how ""American Pie"" conquered our fear of Columbine, ""New Guy"" is actually a pretty harmless movie.  The story stretches credibility, not with the stunts Dizzy/Gil endures, but by having his new schoolmates prove so utterly gullible to his unimaginative schemes (including one scene where he motivates the team to victory riffing on George C. Scott's ""Patton"" monolog; R. Lee Emerey's DI from ""Full Metal Jacket"" would have been a more daring choice).  The cool groups of Dizzy's new school are so ready to allow Gil into their restricted class, it's not even a class at all.  Despite it's thin story, ""New Guy"" manages to pull of a lot of fun.

1733481,3,B000069HQ1,"The New Guy, just one of the many teen movies we were being slapped with monthly a few years ago. But now they're just sporadicly released, and I guess that's making them a little better. For The New Guy, although not flashy or star-filled, was an entertaining flick.
 The story is a twist on the ""fish out of water"" plot with the main character, Dizzy, transcending from ""a blip on the radar screen"" to one of the most mysterious yet undeniably hip students at a high school. His transformation is done by a prison mate who - and I found this weird - could be visited frequently. There were actually a lot of weird plot hole instances in this movie, but they're easily overlooked for the film has a sense of stupidity about it. Which could annoy some, but make it entertaining enough for others.
 DJ Squalls was perfect for this role, and although not an A-list actor, he handles himself well and has a bit of comic timing. Eddie Griffin is - as always - annoyingly funny, yet his act is toned down here and his humour is felt a bit more than normal. Eliza Dushku carries us through with the lead female, and she's luscious as always. I've got to note that there were some interesting cameos throughout the entire movie.
 While the DVD is almost featureless (a music video, the trailer, etc.), The New Guy is a good buy if you enjoyed the flick itself.",1041206400,,1353,4.44758064516129
1733522,3,B000069HQ1,"It seems I'm not the only one who reluctantly rented this movie when I couldn't find anything more appealing.  Still, it turned out to be worth the effort.  Dizzy, the lead character, is a loser at his school, at least until he is turned around by a convict who takes pity on him.  Now, he's at a new school, parading as a guy named Gil, and trying to fit in.
The previews for this movie looked absolutely horrendous, but it was actually pretty funny.  Granted, there were a ton of forced jokes that were downright ridiculous, and that left you wondering what kind of idiot would write such a script.  Still, despite this setback, there were many funny moments.
The cameos are great--I laughed when I saw Henry Rollins, Tommy Lee, Vanilla Ice, and David Hasselhoff turn up.  As I said, the movie has a certain kind of forced humor to it, but there is enough entertainment value to watch it at least once.  You may not want to own it, but you won't be wasting your time (at least not too much) by watching it once.",1039737600,5,1013,4.385026737967914

No, I'm not going to say it's a great movie and laugh your butt off kind. And yes, it's a teeny flick. But it's worth watching it at least once. The moral isn't all that good, if there was one. Why do you always have to have morals anyways? The cameos are good and funny. I had a few laughs at those. Especially Tony Hawk and Vanilla Ice.

He comes back with a tattoe and a new hair cut and meets the jerk's girlfriend(Eliza Dushku). She starts throwing her boyfriend aside and paying atention to the New Guy!

1733526,1,B000069HQ1,"I haven't caught a ""teen"" flick in a long time, and am glad to say that I don't need to catch another one for another very long time. No, I'm far from being a teen, and I know this film isn't for me. And I wouldn't think of expecting anyone to try to ban this type of film. I would think this kind of movie would die out on it's own because there's nothing there, but they keep getting made.
Well, I guess there is something there, and that something is the sight of pretty teenage girls in outfits skimpy enough to titillate but keep the rating at PG-13. The movie is so blatant about it there is one scene where the girlfriend is shown in about a dozen swim outfits within the span of two minutes for the sheer purpose of pleasing our hero, and we assume, the target audience.
Of course they throw a moral plot hook about how you shouldn't lie at the end of the film for it's official justification. But that's after an hour and a half of every bodily function joke one can think of.
The point is, if the reason you go to see the movie is to see scantily-clad young ladies, the world offers you a much better product with magazines, the Internet, and heck, even a lot of TV shows. If that's what you want, seek it there, as it's cheaper and less time-consuming. If you're going to invest eight or more bucks and a few hours of your life into something, see a movie where you can get the same out of it if you leave your brain at home.",1037664000,3,1436,4.132142857142857
1733527,4,B000069HQ1,"The absurdity is what makes this movie so funny.  They makers didn't try to address any ""hard hitting"" issues, they didn't try to over dramatize things.  If I want ER, I'll watch ER.  If I want Schindler's List, I watch it.  When I want a movie with a good simple story that still makes me laugh after I've seen it with my 4th group of friends in a week I'll watch this movie.  DJ Qualls did a great job, I just wish his big song number at the end went a little longer.  Eddie Griffin was great, and a laugh a minute.  And what can I say about Eliza Dushku, beautiful, ... and it was fun seeing her in a ""good guy"" roll.  Buffy and Angel fans will be presently surprised.  The movie also boasted a fun group of cameo rolls.  It's fun to try and spot them all.  A nice light fun hearted flick.",1033084800,2,792,4.04516129032258

1733529,4,B000069HQ1,"I didn't see this flick at the theaters because of critics, so I rented, and for my 4 bucks it was worth it. Now, I'm cynical about buying movies...it has to be good and/or cheap. For me it's gonna be both :). I laughed so hard I think my neighbors thought I was on some type of drug.
 This movie wasn't made to emulate all the other teeny bopper movies. Instead of seeing high school through the eyes of Ultra jocks and the Ultra preppies, you see through the eyes of Dorks. Who, in my opinion didn't seem all that dorky...granted they wouldn't have been able to sit at my lunch table ...but then again they wouldn't have been tormented either. The story itself is believable beyond belief. If you've ever been a transfer student, then you know what I mean.

Granted...with every movie there is cliches, the mass humilation...geek gets the hot girl...
But geek turned cool-rebel-thug-guy goes through a grand and menancing entrance thanks to new found friends at the state penn (Eddie Griffin,Jermaine ""JD"" Depree)elude that he is the new roughneck on the block, but gets his [rear] kicked in the first few minutes of being the ""new guy"" that was simply hilarious.
What I liked most about this movie is DJ's character was able to be himself to an extent. Most teen movies project their characters as the more popular you get the phonier you get. The only problem that the main character faced was do I dis my geeky friends or do I pull them into the new found popularity? At this point in the movie he doesn't realize that he could've befriended Freddy Kruger and everyone would've been fine with it.
Terrific movie with a great spin on teen movie cliches....and plenty of interesting Cameos....Seeing Vanila Ice as a clerk at the music store is hilariously reality imitating life...see it for that if nothing else...too funny",1032480000,,1827,4.670807453416149

  The storyline was horrible! Dizzy, the school dork , DJ Qualls, gets tossed in jail for breaking a mop, I mean come on! And he gets schooled on how to be a ""bad boy"" by all the inmates there. I know it the story sounds funny, but, really it's not.
  He tranfers to a new school, new look and all, and shows what a punk he is. In the end everything kind of muddles into place.
  Well, if you want to see a funny movie, don't get this one, it's a let down! Get Road Trip or American Pie, they will have you rolling on the floor!",1031011200,4,693,3.8450704225352115
1733561,3,B000069HQ1,"I wasn't expecting much at all when I sat down to watch The New Guy, and although it was by far no masterpiece, it wasn't quite as bad as I thought.
As a comedy, this movie fails on most levels. Most of the jokes fall flat and the situations are clichd. In fact, the first half of this film is abysmal. I had already given up on the film being even salvageable until the second half brought in some redemption.
Yes, it becomes a little cheesy, but it puts a few twists on the usual storyline. It avoids the usual ""rags to riches"" template in which the unpopular nerd has something happen and becomes popular and disses his old friends, then everyone finds out his secret and he becomes the same old nerd but now values his old nerdy friends. The New Guy follows the first half of the formula, but then takes a nice departure. Sure it's still on the predictable side, yet it is sweet and uplifting.
In fact, it is the charming cast of characters that save this film in the end from a one star fate. DJ Qualls is very likable as the nerd, his friends seem like people you'd want to hang out with in high school, and several cameos are amusing. Also, Lyle Lovett as the nerd's father is quite entertaining.
If the jokes were actually funny and the filmmakers toned down the cheese factor at the end, this film would make a good teen film. If you like teen movies, it's worth a rental. If you don't like them, stay away. This one offers nothing for you.",1030838400,,1449,4.291970802919708

1733563,3,B000069HQ1,"Let's all face it, the true great teen comedies came out in the 1980's..'sixteen candles, breakfast club, ferris bueller, Heathers...""
I did laugh a few times in this, but i was then wretching. What is it with teen comedies today? So many of them are crude and disgusting.
""The New Guy"" at least has a message: be yourself.
DJ Qualls, who was the really geeky guy in Road Trip, plays Dizzy. He wants so badly to fit in, he does anything in his power to do so..  He ends up in jail after some minor charges brought against him in school, and is schooled in how to be cool by Eddie Griffin, who was funny in this. He doesn't even have to say anything, he has great expressions. Such as the EYE...
Dizzy has his real friends, and then makes new friends at a new school after being expelled.  Elisha Dishku, who I remember from the t.v. show ""Buffy the vampire slayer"", plays Dizzy's new friend who takes him under her wing, and helps him become ""in"". Eventually the jig is up, and everyone finds out the truth about the new guy...This is typical-- very predictable but at the same time is sort of funny in a stupid way.
Country singer, and sometime actor Lyle Lovett plays Dizzy's father. He is actually pretty good in this.
This is cute for a few laughs, it's not the worst of it's kind. It's hardly a classic. I think a younger audience than myself and fans of Elisha will appreciate this more.",1030060800,,1393,4.374517374517374

DJ Qualls who starred in Road Trip which was an excellent movie also plays the lead character in this movie.

Only a few funny parts, and lack of any real acting (with the exception of Eliza Dushku), and just general predictability made this one not worth seeing again.",1029628800,,415,4.135802469135802
1733566,1,B000069HQ1,"Last night I had the, well, I won't say pleasure so let's just say occurrence, of watching ""The New Guy"" on DVD.
Yeesh.
As most people who know me, or at least read what I write about movies on occasion, know that I'm pretty forgiving about movies. I don't expect Shakespeare when it's not meant to be Shakespeare. It's a good way to be, as there are lots of movies out there that aren't great by any means but have their charm.
The New Guy ain't one of them.
It's about this kid who enters his senior year hoping to be more than just a loser, gets horribly embarassed, goes to prison for a day or so for no real reason, gets the idea from an inmate he befriends that if he gets expelled and sent to a new school, he can start acting all tough and crazy and be popular, does so, and becomes so before the inevitable unveiling of who he used to be by the bullies at the old school. And of course all is forgiven because even though he supposedly has a reputation as a crazy killer of a guy at the new school, he still has a heart of gold.
Throughout the movie we also see him in and out of prison, just visiting it appears, but still allowed in among all the kind-hearted inmates. And we see Jerry O'Connell and his brother who are way too old to still play high school guys. And we see football games that play out in mere minutes. And we see Eliza Dushku trying out bathing suits. That was the good part. The only good part in the whole movie.
No wait, there was a second, Zooey Deschenal was in the movie.
Do yourself a favor - don't see this movie. Don't be stupid like me. If given the choice between this movie and unnecessary dental work, choose the movie, but at least think hard about it before doing so.",1029542400,2,1712,4.159638554216867

and the Part of the problem with The New Guy is that it's an R-rated film trapped in a PG-13 body. Like so many movies today, it is squeezed into a rating that will allow it to cater to teenagers, even though the material screams for more irreverence. the scene has to be staged so that you know what's happening without really seeing it, and that causes the whole joke to collapse under its own weight. By being so careful not to show too much, the editing totally distracts from what's happening. It feels awkward when it should be hilarious",1029369600,,708,4.496124031007752

The plot is good, it's just that they didn't fufill the funny part. Boring jokes, stupid commentary and bad acting, all leading up to an amazingly predictible ending.
