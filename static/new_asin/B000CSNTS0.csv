8101778,3,B000CSNTS0,The movie was so so. Kids didn't really watch it. Maybe I'll try again in a few years when their older.,1366848000,,103,3.9523809523809526
8101779,5,B000CSNTS0,"I saw the 2011 version of the Ohmies show in New York in last January with my two young nephews. They love it. They sang along with the music, danced and were so engrossed with the actors on stage they copied every move they performed. The show teaches young kids yoga movements without ever telling them its exercise. It's a musical for children that both kids and parents can love because the characters are fun to watch and the lessons educational. I bought the DVD disk because my nephews really were enthusiast about the show and they didn't sell copies at the theater. It appears that a new cast album will be coming out later this year and that this version was developed when the show was created several years ago.  No matter, my kids love it just the same.  Now everytime I go to my sisters house, the boys drag me to the TV to watch the show with them over and over. It's funny, the show has made me a hero with my nephews and their parents.",1303516800,,952,4.312849162011173
8101780,5,B000CSNTS0,"The story of their journey to see the sun is interesting, the songs are catchy and my four year old loves to get up and do all the yoga poses with them! I find myself singing the songs constantly! I love the Ohmies!!",1234742400,,216,4.046511627906977
8101781,4,B000CSNTS0,"Entertaining for adults and kids alike no matter if they're familiar with yoga, or not.  The songs are fun and catchy, especially the ones performed by the dogs!!  What a great way to get little ones up and moving, or just introduced to world music.  We liked this DVD more than  the Jamarama Live DVD...The Ohmies full show seems so interactive, educational, and fun!  I hope they tour and do this full show...the kids will love to see them (so will we!!)",1206662400,2,456,4.512195121951219
8101782,1,B000CSNTS0,"I had high hopes for this, but I was pretty disappointed. Poorly produced and annoying, especially the butterfly. My 2 yr old (who knows and enjoys performing yoga poses) lost interest in about 2 mins. I wish I hadn't wasted the money.",1197676800,,235,4.619047619047619
8101783,5,B000CSNTS0,"I had heard about the stage play for kids with the Ohmies from friends, and to be perfectly honest I thought, hmmm, a kiddie musical incorporating yoga moves?  Really?

Don't bother trying to imagine it.  You have to experience the DVD.  It is one of the most innovative, remarkable musical projects  that I have had the pleasure to share with my little ones.  The music is rockin' toe-tapping world beat, the story line actually activates the viewer in actions and songs that they can participate in while watching.

Not only were my kids totally mesmerized and transported, but it actually had a message - about conquering your fears, about friendship, not to mention the fact that the musical taught my son and daughter actual yoga moves along the way.

All I can say is genius, genius, genius.  Well produced, well worth it...",1134691200,5,830,4.788732394366197
