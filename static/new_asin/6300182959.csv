7804002,5,6300182959,"I used this tape when it first came out on cassett!  I used it to lead a regular jazzercise class in the condo building I was living in at the time and all the women, mostly elderly, absolutely loved it!!  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun and get in shape.  Judi is the real deal, she's funny and energetic.  I'm going to buy it again because I don't know what happened to that old tape, so glad it's still available!!",1444262400,,439,4.129411764705883

7804005,5,6300182959,"I have Judi Sheppard Misset's stretch and tone tape which I've been enjoying so much. I remembered doing one of her jazzercise tapes in the past and decided to order this one. I was pleased to find that it was all new to me--I'd never done this one and it really got me moving, sweating, heart pounding. I'm 66 and I decided that maybe I've been too gentle with myself lately--this tape really made me feel as though I'd had a workout. I was better with the actual aerobics than I was with the sitting exercises towards the end. Some of them would have played havoc with my back so I spent some of the time doing fanny tucks and crunches since I'd already had plenty of stretching and toning with her other tape today. I'm looking forward to doing this often. I think it will move me into high gear.",1373328000,4,799,4.298013245033113

7804007,5,6300182959,I did this Jazzercise for years in my younger days and then I stopped. But after a few years past I missed doing it so when I found it I ordered it:),1364774400,2,149,3.6875
7804008,5,6300182959,I have this video and it is one of those that is fun to do.  It is a good workout too. And Judy knows what she is doing.,1213315200,,120,3.2857142857142856
