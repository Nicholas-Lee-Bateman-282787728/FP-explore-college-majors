8718165,5,B00KGKPM84,"I have been a lifelong train fan, but this is my first purchase of this type. The production could have easily, ahem, jumped the tracks - camera lingering to the point of boredom, tiresome or corny narration, etc. - but everything held together well. The minimal narration was informative (British narrator?) with some historical factoids thrown in. The shooting locations and camera work were handled well with track-side landmarks subtly integrated into the shot - I'm a Louisiana native, and I felt the look and feel of the area was captured accurately. Picture and sound were excellent, particularly considering the difficulty in capturing the needed dynamic range of volume. Top-notch production.",1449446400,,701,5.324324324324325
