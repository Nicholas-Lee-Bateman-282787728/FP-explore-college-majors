2570856,1,B000FKP0K0,"Very disappointed in the content of this DVD.  Despite the color/cover photo of this DVD displaying the Rocket-powered ME-109, very little content of this DVD has to do with War-weapons-technology.  Instead, the DVD's primary focus is NON-weapons technology (i.e., medical research, the invention of the tape-recording-machine, etc...).  Only in passing is the V1 & V2 mentioned.  And only a few minutes are devoted to the Me-262 and other early & original jets created by Heinkel. Very very disappointed in this DVD.",1363392000,,517,5.345679012345679
2570857,5,B000FKP0K0,"Bunkers - and bunker buster bombs - received plenty of attention during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and this episode of Modern Marvels provides a good summary and background into bunker construction, as well as the bunker mentality, past and present.  It also provides some valuable insight into the ways bunkers have changed the way we fight wars over time.  The documentary opens with a look at ""Project Greek Island,"" the massive bunker complex hidden away beneath the first-class Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.  Built in the late 1950s, this massive underground structure was designed to serve as an emergency relocation center for all the members of Congress.  The most amazing thing about this bunker is the fact that its construction remained a complete secret, even to all the men and women who enjoyed the comforts of the resort during that construction, under the cover of a new west wing and golf course.  Amazingly, the Greenbrier's secret was not revealed until 1992, when the Washington Post spilled the beans in a treasonous article, leading to the site's almost immediate decommission.  As this documentary shows, the only safe bunkers in today's day and age are those no one knows about.  This includes the famous bunker located beneath Cheyenne Mountain, which we also get to take a look at courtesy of this program.

Bunkers are comparatively new on the scene, but the mentality behind them is not, so the documentary spends some time providing a summary on the history of fortified positions, going all the way back to the forts of the 14th century.  We see how advances in weaponry (such as the cannon) and fortification technology (such as steel fortified concrete) have shifted the balance of power between fortified defenses and siege weaponry.  The upshot is that accurate artillery is the Achilles heel of even the most fortified bunker.  According to the documentary, the first true bunkers were built by the Germans in World War I - small, steel reinforced concrete bunkers into their trench lines.  This, of course, let to a veritable explosion of bunker construction in the years following that war.  Witness the Maginot Line of bunkers which, of course, failed to stop the German onslaught in World War II because the Germans merely circumvented France's lines of defense altogether.  We see how the Germans made heavy use of bunkers themselves, though, with particular attention paid to a highly protected submarine base at Lorient.  Even Britain's ""Tall Boy"" bombs could only penetrate a few feet into the structure, a fact which led to the absolute destruction of the town of Lorient itself in an effort to cut off the seemingly indestructible submarine base from supplies.  Another World War II bunker that the Allies failed to destroy was the famous one underneath the German Chancellery.

The aforementioned bunkers, we are told, were never destroyed by Allied bombs because they simply weren't accurate enough.  That is no longer the case, as plenty of military-supplied video from the war in Iraq shows quite vividly.  We're treated to a look at our GBU-28 bunker buster bombs and an explanation and several demonstrations of their effectiveness.  It's somewhat ironic that the nuclear age ushered in a new wave of bunker enthusiasm, with many Cold War Americans building fallout shelters in which to duck and cover, when no bunker can truly withstand a direct hit from a nuclear weapon.

With its virtual tour of several significant bunker sites and its discussion of bunker defenses in context of the history of modern warfare, this truly makes for an excellent episode of Modern Marvels.  Anyone interested in military matters should find this documentary quite entertaining and perhaps even educational.",1227830400,,3771,5.117455138662317
8124351,5,B000FKP0K0,"This DVD is intended for a general audience and, being an engineer, I would have preferred more technical depth.  But there's still plenty of good information in this presentation, and some of the engineered facilities which are described are simply amazing - impressive examples of what engineers can accomplish.  I enjoyed this and will be sharing it with my professional colleagues.  I can recommend it to anyone else interested in levees as well.",1454457600,,450,5.136986301369863
