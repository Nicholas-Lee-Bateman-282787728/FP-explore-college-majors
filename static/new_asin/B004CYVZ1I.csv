4330187,4,B004CYVZ1I,This workout is great - especially when you are short on time.  It's been a good addition to my typical yoga DVD's and strength training.,1301702400,,137,4.48
4330188,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I really like this workout because she's casual and doesn't make it so serious, but you're still getting a great workout. :)",1301356800,3,124,4.681818181818182
4330189,5,B004CYVZ1I,Not your traditional yoga practice but what a GREAT workout!!!  I Love this video!!!!!!! Now I can see why Jennifer Aniston is so in shape.,1301356800,2,139,4.56
4330190,5,B004CYVZ1I,"This DVD is AMAZING! definitely works everything and I feel so great when I am finished, really love Mandy's attitude and outlook :) this is so great that I bought it for my daughter!
definitely would recommend this to anyone!",1299628800,5,226,4.675
4330191,3,B004CYVZ1I,"I have to admit what tipped the scale towards buying this DVD was Jennifer Aniston's recommendation on the back cover. I don't know if I will get her body type from this video, but here's hoping (or more likely praying).  I also have never done any videos with this instructor and was looking for something different.  I thought when I bought this that it was actually something new from Giaim.  I should have known better.  It is actually a repackaging of a DVD called ""Mandy Ingber's Yogalosophy Workout DVD.""  At least it is new to me. The DVD has two workouts, one a 55 minute and the other a 35 minute routine.  There are some things I really like about this DVD and some things not so much, so I'm going to break it down into categories.

combining yoga + strength: 4 stars.  Although this is not a new concept (see Exhale Core Fusion workouts), I like how she alternated between a yoga move and a strength training move. The moves were vey simple and nothing new, but you get a workout of the entire body.  Some moves are static (you stay in one position) and some dynamic.  Some sample moves are downward dog, squats, cat/cow, leg lifts.

Information about form, breath, and how posture can help: 2.5 stars.  I say TMI!  Although you can never have too much info about form and breathing, a running commentary about anything that pops into your mind about yoga is not relaxing to me or helpful after the first time.

Cuing: 1 star.  Although I think the moves are easy enough for a beginner, someone new to yoga is going to get frustrated by this video.  She says she is going to do 8 reps of everything, but doesn't. This inconsistency wouldn't matter, except she doesn't work alternating sides evenly so you have to keep count.  Plus, she will tell you which move to do on the first side, but then forget to tell you she is moving on to the next set.  Because you don't know the exact number to expect, you have to watch her and that can take you out of the pose.

Overall, I would say that the pros outweight the cons for me, but may not for everyone.  You can turn off the instructor and since the cuing isn't that great you won't miss much.  I like combining stregth and yoga.  I was sore the day I did this DVD which is why I decided to make it a yoga day, and it worked the kinks out of my muscles.  I did feel the burn during some of the strength moves.

I recommend this DVD to people who want to try a different yoga practice or who like exhale core fusion (although debatable whether it's as good as ECF).  Due to some of the cons, I recommend trying to rent it or buy it used first.",1299110400,122,2602,4.282786885245901
4330192,5,B004CYVZ1I,"Yogalosophy is the best workout I have had in a long time. Great for beginners or for those that have been exercising for awhile! Jennifer Aniston recommends the workout and you can see why!  THis is a must!! Mandy's philosophy is to have fun and enjoy! SHe is so ""down-to-earth"" and fun!  I highly recommend!",1299110400,4,309,4.6
4330193,5,B004CYVZ1I,I have never really done Yoga before and am physically fit and have worked out all my life.  This DVD is great!  2 workouts on the DVD. I did the 35 min workout and it was challenging yet not too hard for first timers.  My heart was beating at a higher speed even 10 mins after the workout and I broke a sweat!  You will feel good after using this DVD.  I highly recommend throwing this into all your home workouts to add that extra challenge and also speed up your body transformation!,1299110400,33,486,4.182795698924731

4330196,2,B004CYVZ1I,"I finally got around to trying this dvd out this weekend. While I'm sure she's a great happy hour companion, I don't care for her teaching method. She talks SO much, just rattling on and on. She even talks about how much she talks. I found it rather irritating. Also, for several poses, she holds a lot longer on one side than she will with the other when you switch sides from right to left. This mistake goes beyond personality.

It is a really tough workout, veering on a very narcissistic side. Her mantra is certainly not one I would ever use! In short, everyone does yoga for different reasons, however this philosophy isn't one of mine.",1467676800,5,643,4.495726495726496
4330197,2,B004CYVZ1I,"Buyer beware, same DVD under two different covers and Amazon prompts you to buy both with the book. Mandy recorded the routine twice, once while talking and once while silent. Both were edited together terribly. For example: In the sun salutation she says to stay in the pose for eight breaths but you only have time for two before jumping forward. One lunge is held for one minute and 35 seconds where the other side only for 35 seconds. The repetitions are also different from side to side which is annoying.",1467158400,5,510,4.615384615384615
4330198,5,B004CYVZ1I,Great product only really has 2 routines on it,1466899200,,46,4.222222222222222
4330199,3,B004CYVZ1I,"This was a bit disappointing. I bought it because I found a workout this lady did on Pinterest and I loved it. This workout is a good workout, but the truth is that it's not yoga-y enough for me. When I buy a yoga video titled ""Yogalosophy"" from Gaiam, I don't really expect lunges or repetitions or that whole thing. It's more like Pilates, or like some type of yoga crossover workout. I don't mind strength or power yoga classes, but this was almost like a strength-training video that happened to use a few yoga poses as its springboard. So, it was fine, but not awesome. Also, it had a few mild curse words in it, which was annoying. I buy workout videos to work out at home because I'm a mom with kids and it's easier. I assume I'm not the only one. I don't want to be working out with my kids hanging out in the family room with me and have to hear the word a** repeated several times in a row, or whatever. It's annoying.",1466812800,2,928,4.189944134078212
4330200,2,B004CYVZ1I,"I decided to try this DVD after doing her Yoga class on Pop Sugar, although it was a little fast paced for my taste. However, this is NOT yoga, she may do some Yoga poses, but this is really Pilates. Her voice is not calming and she constantly chatters, while you can choose to do the Express workout without audio you don't know which move is coming next. A lot of lunges and squats which is fine if you wanted a toning repetitive movement type exercise, but not if you wanted to do actual Yoga. I like the Crunch Yoga videos and was hoping to find something similar, this is NOT it!",1460592000,3,584,4.223214285714286
4330201,4,B004CYVZ1I,Really enjoy Mandy's workout!  I appreciate her lighthearted instructions and she doesn't take herself too seriously!,1459382400,,117,6.3125
4330202,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I think if you are looking for a ""Yoga DVD"" you will be disappointed.  Because it is not a traditional yoga video.  Which is why it's called Yogalosophy!  It incorporates yoga poses with things like squats and lunges, to give you a really incredible toning workout.  I agree with the reviewers who didn't like her mantra:  ""I love my ass!""  That is bizarre.  But, you can make up your own mantra and go from there.  Other than that, I found Mandy to be sincere, caring, and eager to help you tone your body.

I like that she has a shorter workout (of 35 minutes) as I am just getting back into shape after back and neck injuries.  This workout felt good (and was horrible at times because my muscles were shaking!  But that's a good thing).  After this shorter workout, I go to the ""Extras"" and do her Stretch.  It feels wonderful.

The absolute worst thing is when you get a workout DVD and feel nothing from it.  Yet, you don't want it to be so challenging that you never put it in the DVD player again!  This is right there in the middle, which is fantastic, and you can take breaks at any time and she even encourages it so you don't feel like a failure by taking a break.  I really like her!!",1459036800,2,1197,4.248888888888889

4330206,4,B004CYVZ1I,"Really enjoyable, but definitely challenging. For most people, yoga should flow and add to a sense of a little difficult, but rejuvenating. This one: not so much. However, at the end I did feel challenged and felt pretty accomplished. I use this video as part of my challenging routines when I am looking for more physical change.",1449187200,,330,4.807017543859649
4330207,4,B004CYVZ1I,"These are some real deal poses here, they will make you stretch, strain, and balance like never before.",1447632000,,103,4.777777777777778
4330208,1,B004CYVZ1I,"My first review ever on anything Amazon. Please don't waste your money. All the 1 star reviews I've read tell it like it is. I too wish I had listened because it's as bad as people say. It's not yoga. It's body toning with - oh yeah, I should mention the word yoga - thrown in! Her moves are o.k. but you really have to study the DVD before really knowing where she's at during the routine. I too have had to look up several times to see where she is in the move and then I'd have to rewind because she was way ahead without cues.

I was very disappointed about the mantra ""I have a great ass, I have a great ass, etc."" and my personal favorite, doing plis to work your inner thighs so they won't touch each other when we stand or walk!  Really? That's all there is to focus on. Yoga isn't about having a great ass or ensuring our inner thighs don't touch!  For me, yoga has become a place of accepting myself for who I am in the body I was given and how to better take care of myself spiritually, physically, and mentally. Definitely not getting that message in this DVD. Also, when an instructor where's shorts that are WAY TOO short for any grown adult, you know her focus isn't on helping you but rather promoting herself! God I really go nervous that she would flash me when she did her plies!!!",1446422400,9,1300,4.171314741035856

4330210,5,B004CYVZ1I,"I really love this workout. Mandy is great. She is great at explaining the form and how you should be feeling it. This is the first time I've ever done lunges and felt it in my tush and not in my knees -- which I'm thrilled about!! I love the blend of yoga and more traditional moves, like the lunges, and she goes at a really great pace, not too slow or too fast. Plus -- and this is a great plus :) -- Jennifer Aniston has the prettiest arms I've ever seen, and Mandy is her instructor, so if I can achieve that, I will be oh, so happy :) Love Jennifer Aniston's cute intro, too :)",1443916800,,583,3.9491525423728815

4330223,5,B004CYVZ1I,"After reading Mandy Ingber's book, ""Yogalosophy,"" I ordered the DVD to complement the book. Both together have guided me to a new path of holistic wellness.

4330224,5,B004CYVZ1I,"I love, love, love this DVD. Easy for a beginner, which I mean.  When I started out with a 'beginner yoga dvd' I was discouraged b/c I was not able to do what they did,  nor did I find it relaxing!  Mandy does a wonderful job easing your way in and you can feel yourself getting stronger and confident as you work your way to the harder poses!!!",1437523200,,345,4.044117647058823
4330225,3,B004CYVZ1I,"i like this gal, she is funny and lighthearted in her teaching style but this isn't really a yoga DVD it's a workout that that barrows some yoga technique. Not bad not what I expected from the title though.",1437177600,2,206,4.3076923076923075

4330231,5,B004CYVZ1I,"OMG! I LOVED this DVD! I just tried the 35-minute workout for the first time, and I absolutely enjoyed it! I saw some reviews that gave criticism to the ""lack of cueing"". I had no problem with this. If you keep your eyes on Mandy, listen, and pay attention, you should have no problem following along. I can't wait to do the workout again on Wednesday! I will be giving a results review in a month. I can tell this workout is gonna get the job done! I am worked! Mandy is alright with me!",1430697600,,488,4.147368421052631
4330232,5,B004CYVZ1I,Great deal!,1430352000,,11,5.0
4330233,2,B004CYVZ1I,"Mandy seems like a sweet and positive person, but there is not enough cueing, and some of the camera angles of her were weird.  At one point, you only see her from the waist up, which is not good for a video of this nature.  I will give it a few more tries, but I can not recommend this to anyone.  I have to say, I got more out of her free 30-minute ""bikini"" workout video on PopSugar Fitness (YouTube), which is what made me purchase this Yogalosophy video in the first place.",1429833600,,478,4.118279569892473
4330234,3,B004CYVZ1I,"The option for Yogalosophy Express with Cueing is too wordy. Mandy talks too much.. It should focus more on the moves and not on how she looks and how she thinks her butt looks. If you choose the Yogalosophy Express with music alone, its great, and I like the motivational words on the screen but in some poses I have to turn my neck around to see what she is doing because its just instrumental. It would be better with guided poses, and no personal statements. Jennifer Aniston didn't need to be featured in the intro or on the back of the DVD.. people would have bought it anyway.. there didn't have to be a celebrity on it. All in all, the actual movements were great and burned! It really would have worked better if 1-Mandy didn't talk so much, 2- If the movements were guided, no personal info about her body needed, 3- If the movements lasted longer then half an hour (maybe 50-60 minutes) and finally if after the Yogalosophy Express there was a longer cool down.. I felt like she went from strenuous burning poses to just a basic cross legged slow-breathing then that was it. Just think basic.. it works better.",1427155200,,1121,4.4731707317073175

4330236,4,B004CYVZ1I,I'll start by saying I do really enjoy the workout. I'd say it's really more of a yoga pilates fusion than yoga though. The music is good. As others have said Mandy is very annoying.. I listen to her and think why didn't she re-record this? Or edit that out? Some of the things she says are just ridiculous. But bottom line I bought it to exercise and the workout is good!,1425340800,,372,4.180555555555555
4330237,1,B004CYVZ1I,"I can't even think of anything slightly positive to say about this video. It is *not* a yoga video, that is for sure. She talks to the audience as if they are beginners but does not give any kind of instruction on the yoga poses themselves which I would imagine would be really frustrating for someone just starting out. She does not tell you when she is changing poses and I got behind very easily. Also, a personal pet peeve was that she was renaming some yoga poses (like 'lightning bolt' and 'cat/dog') so when she did remember to tell you she was changing poses I still did not know what she wanted me to do.

The second part of the video contained various strength training moves, more like pilates, which would normally be fine for me and some of the moves did make me feel like I was getting some kind of workout. But the things she was saying in this section were very offensive to me. She was basically fat-shaming and talking about how your thighs shouldn't touch and getting a dimple on the side of your butt. She said several times that the sole purpose of working out is to look good. And this is not the case *especially* with yoga, looking good is a secondary bi-product of your practice. Yoga is controlling your body and breathing and learning a lot about yourself along the way. It makes me sad to think someone would pick this up and think this is what yoga is.",1425340800,,1381,4.373540856031128

4330239,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I haven't actually done the workout yet, but having said that, my one criticism so far is, I would rather not have music accompanied by lyrics when I'm doing yoga ... there are parts of the dvd that have just instrumental music to go along with the exercises, so I'm happy about that ... Mandy has a lovely way about her so I think I can get past the music during those segments, but something she might want to think about for the future ... the music with lyrics are distracting and kind of annoying ... sorry, just sayin'",1423612800,,524,4.303030303030303

Try it first with her speaking and if it gets on your nerves play it with music only, there is an option for that. She knows what she's doing but talks a LOT, and mantras like ""I have a great a**, I have a great a**"" are more silly than helpful. This is some good yoga for strength, you will feel it in your legs. If you just do it for learning the exercises and are a beginner or intermediate you'd like this, experts might not find it too challenging.

4330253,1,B004CYVZ1I,"Yeah...definitely not the best yoga DVD out there. I REALLY wanted to like this DVD, but, as some people have already mentioned in their reviews, her practice and mantra are kind of superficial (''I have a great ass'', ''love your ass'', etc.). It's also really hard to follow because she does not always tell you when to switch sides/positions, so you have to sort of look at the screen often, which makes it stressful and less enjoyable. I have nothing against a hard yoga workout, but this one is so focused on apperances and not on the whole mind&body experience.",1408579200,2,567,4.68

4330258,2,B004CYVZ1I,"This is an ok DVD. It really wasn't what I was expecting. I practice a traditional Yoga, and looked for something I could also have at home. It was ok, but more of a focus on Yoga being strictly a body-shaping exercise, with some strange language used for a Yoga class. (I understand she was trying to be funny, and probably is to many.)

4330266,1,B004CYVZ1I,"I was so excited to receive this dvd, only to be totally disappointed.  First of all, this is not a Yoga video. There is no flow, there is no real instruction. Instead, there are separate, quick exercises in the midst of constant adolescentesque chit chat (""but if you are thinking about someone you have a crush on, that's okay too.."")  As if the stupidity in her comments wasn't bad enough, she then insults the viewer's intelligence by sharing her mantra ' ""I have a great a$$. I have a great a$$"" ... then throughout the workout keeps reminding us of how great she thinks she looks in her shorts.  All delivered in a highly annoying, nasaly voice.

You cannot do this video and focus on your workout without watching her, as she provides little to no instruction. More than once I found myself doing an exercise, just to look up and see she had moved on to something else without a word. It's as if she was making it up as she went along.

I'm not a super fan of Jennifer Aniston (I don't really care either way) but I did think that with her backing, the dvd would be good. Not. Even. Close.",1397520000,7,1096,4.352941176470588
4330267,3,B004CYVZ1I,"First, this is not a yoga video.  If you are seeking a true yoga experience, look elsewhere. Otherwise, you will be disappointed, as I was.

Although there are yoga poses in this DVD, it's more like calisthenics, or ""toning"" exercises as Mandy calls them.  Yes, there are some horribly cued sun salutations on this, and she uses one Sanskrit word - Namaste.  Yes, there are some warrior poses.  Yes, there's a pigeon pose.  However, this is such a mish-mash of things that I think it's more like ""Yoga mixed with gym exercises for those who think they want to do yoga but they find they can't calm their mind to do yoga.

One thing that annoyed me is that this isn't a flow. It's definitely broken into chapters, yet all the chapters aren't available on a menu, just some.  No chapter moves smoothly into the next.

And seriously, no savasana?  These yoga DVDs without savasana are annoying.  For those of you making yoga DVDs, if nothing else, have a five to 10-minute savasana that's guided and use instrumental music in the background.

The positives include Mandy, the music and the setting.

Mandy is fun, and she seems sincere. Honestly, the ""I love my butt"" comments that others complain about are all said in fun, and not in a narcissistic way.  I hope she makes another DVD, but one that is more yoga and less exercise. Plus, she's over 40, and who wouldn't want to look as good as she does?

The music is great.  A lot of smooth jazz or R&B.  I absolutely love the music.

The setting is on an ocean and it's very peaceful.

I bought this from B&N, but I wish that I had been patient enough to get it from Netflix or borrow from the library.  I doubt I'll ever do it again.",1397260800,,1683,4.420195439739413
4330268,5,B004CYVZ1I,"My best friend recommended this DVD to me a couple of weeks ago after raving about how amazing it is. As soon as I put it in, I could tell she was absolutely right! Mandy Ingber is such a pleasure to watch and makes you feel nothing but comfortable and relaxed and she takes you through the exercises. She even sympathizes with you while doing some of the more exerting exercises and poses, but manages to help you either laugh or work through it! Already after two weeks, I've discovered muscles I didn't even know were there. Just like Mandy, my mantra as I do these exercises now is, ""I have a great ass!""",1396396800,,608,4.342105263157895

I've been doing yoga and pilates almost daily for about 2 weeks and have seen tremendously quick leaning, strengthening and toning results, so I had a base of strength for this and it is really good.

Worst of all, the practice did not end with shavasana. Any practice without ending in shavasana is NOT true yoga. If you're looking for a workout DVD, according to her, ""To get a nice butt,"" this might be good for you, if you're looking to start a true home yoga practice/experience, then I would definitely pass on Mandy.

I'd highly recommend any of Ashley Turner, Tamal Dodge, Seane Corn or Rodney Yee's yoga practices.",1393891200,,554,4.711340206185567

I did not enjoy how she was all about working out to get a nice bum and body. I believe we should work out to better our body for health purposes not to look a specific way. To me yoga is about connecting to our selves and loving who we are and I did not get this vibe from this video. Some other yoga videos I enjoyed much more were Aim True yoga and Bethenny Frankels yoga videos.,1393804800,,494,3.95

4330293,5,B004CYVZ1I,"I am overweight, but not significantly, and I was afraid to try this.  Admittedly I bought the DVD because Mandy Ingber is Jennifer Aniston's trainer.  I love Jen and I remember Mandy from a movie when I was a teenager.  I was worried the moves would be too fast or that I would be uncoordinated or out of sync.
That was far from the truth.  Mandy moves at a pace that is just right, with several opportunities to rest.  I could really feel those muscles working, and literally burning, but not in a bad way.  The arm and abdominal poses were very difficult and I couldn't do a couple of them, so I tried to maintain it as long as I could.
I like Mandy's funny comments such as ""I have a nice a$$"" and ""you can think about the guy you have a crush on"" and ""If you're still doing this you're a champ.""  Very motivating.  I also like the beach scenery.  Very calming.
The best part about this workout is that I could really feel my muscles working but I SWEAR they were NOT sore the next day.  I was absolutely amazed by that!",1384646400,,1024,4.178571428571429

4330296,3,B004CYVZ1I,"I went in search of a good yoga DVD because my knees have been giving me heartache from years of weight-lifting, running and biking.  This girl starts out the first program on the DVD with tons of lunges and squats (exactly what I need to avoid) and they were not what I would call traditional yoga poses.  I couldn't get past her ultra corny comments, just irritating.  (For example her first mantra is something like ""I have a great ass.""  Really, I'm not joking.)

Thinking that the second program on the DVD might be better, I tried that one the next day.  That seems to have more traditional yoga poses, less irritating talk, but no direction.  She guides you through the first part of the pose, then repeats the poses several times without telling you when to shift your pose.  It isn't possible to look up and watch her and do the poses correctly in order to go at her pace.

Yogalosophy is not your typical yoga workout. It is relaxing but it also helps strengthen your core and every other part of your body. I really found it stimulating. It's relaxing enough that you're not huffing and puffing like doing aerobics but let me tell you, you feel it the day after.

I don't regret buying this DVD. It's perfect for those days I want a routine that isn't as strenuous as a high impact one but with just about all the benefits.

Well, this is much more gentle, yet I work up a sweat.  Plus, the instructor is just fun!  She is happy, smiley, and positive.

This is one of my new favorites. I think it is neat that the editors used 2 different ""cuts"" into one: one where Mandy is talking, the other where she is not. There were a few times where the handheld aspect of some shots made me lose my balance (haha!) but it was fine.

I wasn't expecting a peaceful, meditative, type of yoga DVD, I knew that when I decided to buy it, but I was expecting it to be better cued throughout the DVD (I was hoping the negative posts on here were just being blown out of proportion).  The right thing for Jen and her bud to do is RECALL THESE DVD'S and offer a new one with much improved cues!!!  It's THAT awful folks, so awful I am considering going back to Team Jolie!!!

All the advertisement about Jennifer Aniston makes you believe she has a significant role in this DVD, but all she has is a 2 min intro.
The work out itself- I didn't try the express workout, but I did try the extended workout. I'm glad I'd warmed up beforehand with a few cat/cows and sun salutations because Mandy went into a lot of poses without warming up that part of the body.

Also, she doesn't cue the sequences, and you're lost unless you keep looking at the screen- which can be quite annoying and even detrimental, since you're not always facing the screen.

The focus on toning is so heavy that she should say 'inspired by yoga' for this DVD. A lot of emphasis on the legs/hips/abs, but not much to relax that part after you work it.

She shouldn't try to be a yogi- it's ok if she's really a high-society trainer, there's nothing wrong with it. But she can't pull off being a yogi when she's repeating ""I love my @$$"" over and over again.

I did one workout, and I think that was the last one.",1370217600,2,1216,4.391111111111111

4330383,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I purchased Mandy's ""Yogalosophy"" (not my favorite name!) first because of how Jennifer Aniston spoke about how much she helped her during a difficult time in her life, not only physically (let's face it, Jennifer Aniston already looked amazing), but mentally.  And that's what I was looking for.  Would I like to look like JA?  You betcha!  Do I think I ever will?  Ummm...no.  But I've been pleasantly surprised at how effective this yoga/workout is!  A good, challenging workout that flows nicely into the yoga positions I'm used to.  All with the very important reminder to breathe and focus.  There are a couple of times Mandy has seemed a bit irritating to me, maybe a little ""I'm all that"" kind of impression, but I find myself liking her more and more and accepting her (the her I ""know"" just through a DVD!)...and when my daughter and I do the workout together, we have a great time.  ""Do I look like Jennifer yet,?"" I whisper breathlessly....""getting close mom!"" is her reply.  No wonder why I love my girl!  Definitely buy this one!",1370131200,4,1043,4.701657458563536
4330384,5,B004CYVZ1I,The 30 minute workout on this video is perfect for continuing to create a change with my body during a time when fitting in a work out is challenging.  I've tried other 30 minute workouts during the time I've been losing weight when an hour long workout just wasn't going to be possible during times when my schedule has changed.  While these other 30 minute workouts I've tried still kept the weight off I had lost they didn't allow me to continue to lose weight and inches.  This video also has a longer 55 minute workout I have not had a chance to try yet but intend to do so in a couple of weeks when my schedule will allow for longer workouts again.,1370044800,,654,4.258064516129032
4330385,1,B004CYVZ1I,Not at all what I expected.  I think this DVD is boring.  it also focuses on the same body parts all in a row.  To me it's more doing exercises versus Yoga.  Yoga for Dummies is by far much better!,1368144000,,197,3.85
4330386,5,B004CYVZ1I,"This is a wonderful hybrid workout - I really feel that I'm working my entire body and working it well! It left me with the *good* sore feeling that comes from hard work. It's also challenging but not so much so that the exercises cannot be completed even if some modification is necessary (like dropping the knees to the floor for push-ups).

I also really love Mandy. She speaks sort of like a girlfriend would; like a real person and not just an instructor. You SHOULD be thinking of what you're hoping to accomplish by working out and I love that she reminds me of that. She makes me want to feel the burn right along with her and she manages to make that burn feel sort of fun, too.

I would recommend watching this DVD through once before beginning so you can see what she's leading you through. She spends more time on one leg during the beginning instructional part than on the other so you just need to balance the time (counts) on each leg accordingly. No big deal, really. Or start the workout the next time on the other leg. ;-)

4330387,1,B004CYVZ1I,"I just hated it.  I appreciate her positive attitude towards herself and her body but it just came off like she was mugging for the camera and screaming for attention when what I really needed her to do was TEACH.  Her descriptions of the moves seemed to be ""hmm, ok, here's what you should do"" rather than a well-thought out curriculum.  I wanted a dvd with short and long sessions depending on the time I had available.  I did the short instruction with cues and then tried to move to the longer version after a day or two and was completely frustrated.  Unless you're dislocating your neck to stare at the screen while you're doing some of the poses, you won't know when she's moving on to another rep or oose in the longer version.  It was just impossible to follow and I had to just turn it off after about 10 minutes (and I'm a pretty patient person).  I then resorted to a yoga program I recorded from tv.  For no money, I got FAR better instruction and cuing.  This is definitely NOT the right product for a beginner, certainly, and, while well-priced, I wish I had made a different selection.  It's particularly disappointing because I'm sure she has a lot of great knowledge to share; too bad she didn't.",1367366400,10,1214,4.452488687782806

She is always ahead of me.  And she does talk too much.  I will have to try it without the commentary.  Seriously, even if you are not a fan of Jennifer Aniston, who doesn't want a body like hers? If Mandy's version of yoga is how JA got her body, I'm all for it.  I'll just have to memorize the poses and how long she stays there, or just do it at my own pace - which is what yoga is about.",1367280000,,569,3.7394957983193278

Then, you stay static in that position for the next I-don't-know-how-many-minutes while she talk about her mantra...""I have a great ass, I have a great ass"". Yeah. On top of it all, her voice is incredibly annoying.

4330404,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I kind of freaked out a little when I ordered this because some of the reviews were (in my opinion) a little harsh. I have been doing yoga for about 6 years and I love it. This is not a yoga dvd for yoga purists. In my mind, if you're a yoga ""purist"" - whatever that means - you're probably not doing yoga dvds anyway. She's not a guru. She doesn't claim to be. She is putting forth an approach that utilizes the clear benefits of yoga asanas along with tried and true toning techniques to give you a full body workout that is beneficial despite the fact that it is low impact.

It is clear that regardless of her approach, Mandy is knowledgable about yoga practice. Yes some of her cuings are a little unorthodox and it's not like a yoga class where you have a soft spoken yogi help move you through the asanas and then reward you with a minute long shavasana at the end. What she brings is a knowledge of yoga and helps apply it in a way that will help you see results.

A lot of people complained about her talking. I actually found it refreshing - like having your friend instruct you through a workout. She's really funny actually. A couple of times I wanted to say ""yeah, ok I get it you have a rockin' bod"" because she would say things like ""This move is the reason I look good in these shorts"" which, she did look good in those shorts, but that's a given. I think after a few times doing the routines you should be able to do it without cuing and then you don't have to listen to those funny little lines!

This is a pretty tough workout. I consider myself relatively fit - with a dance background and a regular routine of yoga and cardio. There were a couple of times during the routine that I had to take a small break. You don't realize how hard your working!

A couple of reviews said something about it being a little ""Jane Fonda-esque"" in the approach. Again, Jane Fonda had one of the best selling workout routines of all time and a freakin' hot body so ... is that so bad?

I came across this review of Yogalosophy that sold me: [...]

That is not what yoga is about.
Proper yoga will result in toning.  Although it will also include thorough relaxation and self-acceptance.  I did not gather that from this video.

This is what started my obsession with yoga!  Now I have more DVDs but most days I do this one still because it's just the perfect balance of yoga plus toning exercises and cardio for a really good workout.  And I see results extremely fast!

Mandy is very funny to listen to which I like and is fine but I feel like it cut into the quality of this workout.  Cueing was not great half the time I didn't know what I was doing or she would be standing there just talking I felt nearly bored.  I feel like Mandy could be a great trainer she has great exercises just if they would just flow better together I'd be more happy.  I am hopeful that she will come out with a new dvd at some point with some of these issues fixed.  I really like her but I'm not sure if I do enough to keep this dvd.

I have a wide collection of yoga DVDs from Rodney Yee, Sara Ivanhoe (my personal favorite), Kristen McGee, Suzanne Deason, etc.  This is - by far - THE worst yoga DVD I've ever had the displeasure of using.  I got it for Christmas, did it once & cannot bring myself to do it again.  The cueing is non-existent and she talks WAY too much!  I didn't mind her tongue-in-cheek remarks as much as I minded her inattention to the practice itself.  If you are looking for an innovative approach to yoga that focuses on muscle tone, I'd highly suggest Exhale's Core Fusion Yoga.  I rented that from the library and I was very pleased to get from it what I thought I'd be getting from Yogalosophy.  No, no, & no to this DVD!",1357516800,,765,4.300699300699301

anyway, i was truly afraid to try yoga but mandy explains it well and ita not too long of a workout.
i am out of shape and 52. its very hard for me but i can see that if i can stick it out, this might just pay off!!

4330480,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I did this workout for 4 weeks (3x a week) and I saw great results in my butt and abs. My butt is smaller and my obliques are more defined. This workout is fun and fast paced, it gets your heartrate going and you will sweat a little.
This is a combination of toning and yoga so for instance, she's go from Crescent pose into Lunges. A totally new way to do yoga, not only is it effective but it's very fun as well!
The Fully Loaded Challenge is about an hour long but it goes by so quickly. This is a very relaxed practice, like all yoga workouts should be, and the cuing is little vague, sometimes she'll go into a pose without explaining it or telling you to go into the pose. Once you do this workout enough, you'll get used to it and not need to cuing. She keeps it fun and she is very quirky and cool, which makes the workout a lot more enjoyable.

I would recommend this workout to anyone looking for a challenging and fun yoga workout, (and someone looking to tone the stubborn part of their glutes) because it is simply the best.
I hope Mandy comes out with more yoga workouts in the near future, I'm hooked!",1346112000,,1116,4.166666666666667

I've been doing light yoga on an off for a few years, but I haven't really been consistent because I always feel the need to do cardio or strength training instead. I really like that this is a blend of yoga and body weight exercises. I feel like I get in a solid yoga practice but also get some strength training done as well.

4330495,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I agree with a lot of the other reviews I read prior to purchasing this DVD.  It's fast paced, has some great toning moves you will not find in other yoga videos (it's like yoga and pilates in one to me), and it's not the super-serene Buddhist style yoga that dominates my workout library.  I enjoy her humor and lightness throughout the video, but if you are hardcore and are looking to chant and light candles during this DVD, it may not be for you.  I didn't think her poses or exercises were outdated in the least, and were in fact quite challenging!  The 30 minute routine goes by pretty quickly too so it's a refreshing workout where you know you accomplished something.  I look forward to doing the longer segment, but I generally only workout at lunch and 30 min is about all I can spare.  FYI - I am currently in my 8th month of pregnancy and was still able to do nearly everything in this video with confidence and w/out overdoing any muscle group.

The only complaint I have is the cuing, like others have said, it kinda sucks.  She doesn't give a lot of direction and in the beginning, I found myself having to look up a LOT to see if she had moved or switched sides.  Her counting is not completely consistent, which doesn't drive me nuts, but it can be annoying if you are a stickler for a perfectly clean workout.  Once you get used to the routine and know the moves, it shouldn't be a problem to follow along based on memory.  That's about the only thing that takes this from 5 stars to 4.  I really enjoy it and I think if put into a regular routine, it will definitely tone your body and hit some tough areas that are not easy to fix!",1340928000,,1652,4.259615384615385

However, I need a reliable back-up for when the gym/studio classes aren't available. I LOVE this DVD. It is a serious workout. While it's not ""easy,"" it is easy to follow - no weird or stupid moves (I hate the Brazilian Butt Lift DVD). Mandy is more ""Hollywood"" than the average Yoga teacher (philosophical quotes, breathwork with long OHM's), which I find very motivating. To me, there is calming, rejuvinating Yoga and there is cardio/get a serious Yoga-body Yoga. This is the latter. There is no doubt in my mind, you do this workout every day, you WILL get great results. The good thing about it is that it is enjoyable enough to actually do it every day.",1340496000,,755,4.438848920863309

I would consider myself intermediate+ and have been doing yoga for over 10 years...yet after I practiced this DVD for 2 weeks (about 4 days a week) I found new strength (mentally and physically) and really looked forward to doing it.  My arm strength and core have improved dramatically. My legs look more defined.  And seriously, as she promises, you do get a little dimple on the side of your butt. Mandy brings a real positive approach to it too...some of the things she says (even if you don't like her delivery/sense of humor) have resonated with me and have brought more positive to my workouts and days.  I have done Rodney Yee's Power Yoga Total Body for years because I feel it works my entire body and relaxes me...but this added a little spring to my step with the same results.  She's totally inspiring and that's important. You will feel this one. Like others, I really really am awaiting a second.",1334275200,,1029,4.510752688172043
4330499,2,B004CYVZ1I,"I was excited to get this video knowing that Jennifer Aniston trained with Mandy but it is a big disappointment.  There is supposed to be a section with cuing and a section without cuing (music only).  I watched the ""cuing"" section as this was my first time using the DVD and unless your eyes are glued to the screen, there is no way to know what she is doing.  She doesn't tell you which leg to move, she's already out of a pose before she starts talking about the next and although this may ultimately be a good workout, my neck is aching from having to stare at the screen from various positions to see what she's doing next.  I am a yoga teacher, so I do know yoga but without proper cues, I'd also have to be a psychic to do well with this DVD and to really be in the flow of this workout.  I tried the sun salutation segment to see if it was any better and in fact it's worse on the cuing.  She doesn't even completely walk you through one sun salutation letting you know when to come out of downward dog before moving on to the next.  Imagine having to torque your neck in downward dog just to see when she's finally out of it and on to the next sun sal?  I am thoroughly disappointed.  Who tests these DVDs before they are put on the market?  On a good note, she is funny, adding humor with her ""I have a great ass"" mantra, but the lack of cuing gives this a generous two star rating for me.  I will still use it because I paid the money for it, and I'm imagining after about two weeks and having jotted down notes, and having a strained neck, I may have things memorized enough to just do the workout without her and the DVD.  I think the only thing selling this DVD is knowing that Jennifer Aniston has worked with her.  I just want to ask Mandy and her  producers of this DVD to PLEASE REMAKE THIS DVD WITH PROPER CUING!!!!  It's good stuff, other than that!  P.S.  Other than a quick 10 second intro by Jennifer Aniston, she's not in it...if that's in any way what may make you think to purchase it.",1334102400,10,2011,4.12853470437018

In addition to swimming 2/week, I try to work out another 2 times (such as, other types of yoga, a Jillian Michaels workout, or a 2-mile jog).  I have now incorporated this DVD into my weekly workout to focus on toning my arms/abs, in particular.  Yogalosophy requires you to hold the position & breathe.  It is challenging to make it look flawless as Mandy, but if you try your best, you will feel that good ache in your muscles the next day.  Don't be too hard on yourself -- go at your own pace and just do your best.  Mandy does not demand perfection and she is forgiving; she makes the workout fun with her quips!  I would recommend it for people who have dabbled in yoga & are comfortable with exercise, generally.",1333584000,,876,4.465408805031447

4330503,4,B004CYVZ1I,"This is pretty good.  It has some good strength mixed with yoga.  You can turn the cues off or on which is nice.  I like her ""real"" conversational style & less mystical (for lack of a better word) approach.  Beware the word *ss which she uses in the butt exercises a few times.  Some might find it offensive.  I am not offended, but I have a young child in the house sometimes when I work out and choose not to do this video when my daughter is here (which is a bummer if that is the one I want to do).",1331596800,,502,3.9207920792079207

Give it a try!",1328400000,2,361,3.75
4330521,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I started out not liking this video because she does not give cues throughout the sun salutations.  Yes, I would like to know when you want me to go into downward dog, cobra, etc.  Sometimes yoga teachers can have their own spin on Sun Salutations so I found myself doing them with my neck turned towards the TV.  Not ideal.

However, the more I did the Extended workout (55 minutes) the more I enjoyed it and worked up a sweat.  Essentially she is taking poses from yoga and holding them for extended periods of time, pulsing, etc. to build strength.  For example, crescent pose is held for awhile to build up a burn and create heat, then she moves into pulsing lunges for about 8 beats. The deeper I got into the DVD, the more I realized it was more like Core Fusion, and less a flowing practice.  If you are looking for a Vinyasa, this is not the DVD for you.  This is more of a toning and strength building practice.

However, it was challenging and I did feel the burn and work up a sweat. The music is nice and she has a good presence.  I watched the bonus sections first to get a sense of who she is and I loved her concept of a Vision mat (essentially printing your vision board on your mat so it is right there with you while you practice).  I thought that was a really cool idea.  She explained her mantra when doing lunges ""I love my ass"" which made me laugh.  I give it 4 stars, all and all a good challenging practice.  I took off a star for the lack of instruction throughout the sun salutations.  If you are new to yoga, I would watch the Sun Salutation bonus section first.

Namaste.",1328054400,4,1599,4.227722772277228
4330522,5,B004CYVZ1I,"I checked this dvd out from the library and let it sit here for a couple weeks.  Today I popped it in and a few minutes after finishing the workout, came here to amazon to order my own copy... that's how much I loved it!

I didn't do the section that starts with sun salutations, she says to either do that or warm up with a different cardio.  I did 25 minutes of 'Sprint 8' intervals on the elliptical before doing the main Yogalosophy section with cues.  I feel so great right now!  I will definitely be doing this combo again and often.  If you don't have an elliptical, I would warm up with some walk/jogging on a treadmill, outside, or better yet on a rebounder.  Check out Peak 8 or Sprint 8 intervals too.

Another reviewer mentioned the ""thighs shouldn't touch"" comment as dangerous for those with EDs.  Mandy wasn't espousing that view, she was making fun of the 80s type magazines that said things like that.  (Anyway, they probably shouldn't for most body types).  I am sensitive to remarks like that, but I didn't get a negative ED type vibe at all, I heard a healthy ""like your body as your work to improve it"" kind of message.",1327622400,3,1140,4.380952380952381

4330524,5,B004CYVZ1I,"I've done the work out twice, and I really like it.  I definitely felt the benefit of the toning moves and the yoga poses.  She moves you through sun salutations first, then a yoga pose followed by a pose related toning exercise for, 2 sets of 8 reps with pulses, and then on to the next pose.  I think it's perfect for active rest days, where you want to do something (like provide a nice stretch to my very tight hip flexors) but you're still recovering from the previous days hard core workout.  She has a light hearted, humorous approach to working out, but also encourages you to push yourself and pay attention to what your body is telling you.  I read some other reviews who were harping on her butt mantra, etc. and all I can say is lighten up!  The only thing I wish she would have done a better job of is cueing during the more complex parts of the sun salutations because it's hard for me to look at the screen to see the next move.  I find the older I get, the more I need to incorporate yoga and this is definitely going to be added to my workout rotation.  I hope she brings out more workouts!",1327190400,,1107,4.188679245283019

She makes multiple insensitive comments about the body (thighs should not touch) and praises her own body multiple times. Also, she makes fun of yoga, WTF!?!!  I think she has taken beautiful yoga poses and transformed them into dreaded punishments by holding certain poses far longer than is done in regular yoga and by combining them with things like lunges and squats.  Yoga works the mind and body.  This DVD may get you the great butt this lady brags about but it won't bring you any kind of inner peace. Decent workout video, I use it without the commentary just to avoid listening to this instructor.",1325894400,4,763,4.54014598540146

Okay I literally JUST did it and still in my workout clothes and yes they're sweating but I don't care I just had to write this review!!!!! I am a yoga teacher and I really think this video is for everyone!!! Given the cues are not really great and I can see someone that does not practice yoga may have a hard time with sun salutations but just watch it a few times and you will be right on track!!!! It doesn't really matter if you have a spiritual yoga practice or just like for purely a workout this is a video for you!!! Spiritual people are spiritual no matter what practice they are doing and this DVD is not spiritual at all so it is perfect for others as well!! I just really cannot say enough great things about this DVD. If you are on the fence...... come to this side and buy the DVD today!!!! wooohooooo!!!,1325808000,,897,4.22093023255814
4330527,3,B004CYVZ1I,"First, a quick background on me. I have been doing yoga in a studio nearby for almost a year...so Im not really a true beginner, but I am far from advanced!

If this review were just for the workout I would give it 4 (if not 5) stars. Its not a super fancy workout, or anything wild and crazy, but it definitely works you out. Basically, she takes yoga poses (like crescent) and has you pose for 8 seconds, once youve held the pose you do 8 of some toning moves that are similar to the pose (like lunges). Again, its not anything super crazy or unheard of, but the workout feels pretty darn good and works muscles in different ways than yoga alone.

All that being said, I really do not enjoy her instructing style. Instead of explaining the moves and what shes doing both in the poses and for the toning, she talks about whatever pops into her head like how amazing her butt is, or how its neat that birds flew overhead. I don't think it would bother me so much if she could explain when the pose was changing, when to switch sides, how she was doing a pose, etc despite her ramblings....but she doesnt. I had an especially hard time when I tried the 55 minute workout for the first time. For example, in the beginning where you are doing sun salutations, there is essentially no instruction. I would recommend watching the video once before trying to follow along and perhaps muting the video when you've worked up to it.",1325721600,9,1423,4.366037735849057
4330528,3,B004CYVZ1I,"I actually liked the exercises on this video.  What I didn't like was the instructors constant inane talking.  This might have been ok had the talk been about the poses.  However, she mainly talked about how much she loved her body and the fact that she hoped she didn't flash anyone with her tiny little shorts.  Because many yoga poses are done without being able to see your tv (i.e. downward dog, plank, etc.) it's extremely hard to follow a yoga instructor that refuses to say what pose is coming next.  There is an option on the dvd to practice with music only.  I haven't tried this yet but it has to be better than the alternative.  My advice? Go with Rodney Yee",1325635200,5,670,4.3983739837398375

I have practiced, at home, with Rodney Yee's dvds in the past and was curious to try Mandy's.  I had heard of her through various articles, etc.  After fully reviewing the ""video"" first, I thought this would be a good practice.

A few problems - Mandy's shorts are too short.  I'm not a prude, but it's rather indecent.  Her music selection is alright, but not very relaxing.  Her pace is too fast.  She changes poses without giving enough preparation and there I was in down dog and Mandy was already standing at the top of the mat!!!!  Whilst jumping back from mountain to plank, I heard a pop in my knee!  I've never heard this before.

I'm not crazy about her 'yogalosphy'.  Even in her explanation of this self created word, I was confused.  I think she's darling, but not the real deal.",1325548800,6,911,4.4156626506024095

There is one section I do like - the express yoga. If you are looking for a quick and good workout centered around yoga (but not totally yoga)then the express yoga section is good. And because she does talk to much, after about a week or two you will know the flow enough to switch to the option of just having music play during the express yoga.",1319673600,2,596,4.102564102564102

4. renames yoga poses to suit her (""This pose is called cat-cow, but I call it cat-dog"")
5. thinks ""it's yoga as long as we stay connected to the breath"", with no explanation as to what ""staying connected to the breath"" really means (and, obviously, what yoga really means)
6. condescending toward yoga (""They say this pose opens the heart, but, <smirking> I don't I know about that.  Well, I guess I 'feel the love'  <laughter> ""
7. no instruction on entering/exiting poses, little to no cueing as to when to change poses/exercises

4330534,2,B004CYVZ1I,I have to say that I was very disappointed with this video.  I have been practicing yoga for over 6 years and I was looking to carryout some of my practices with a guided video.  Mandy Ingber uses nice flows however when you choose the complete workout she does not describe what pose to move into.  So here I am in one pose and she's moved on to the next.  It's rather hard to look at the television while you are in downward dog and know that she has moved on to the next pose.  Well another video that will sit on my shelf!,1317686400,8,526,4.019230769230769
4330535,4,B004CYVZ1I,"I bought this dvd because in the last few months, I've been getting into yoga and pilates to supplement my running.  With Jennifer Aniston's name attached to this instructor, I was definitely willing to try it out.
I also read some favorable reviews.

I've tried many, many yoga dvds and this one has a very strong emphasis on toning. I would have liked it to have a bit more in terms of stretching, but it's good and will definitely give you a workout.  I prefer dvds that actually make me feel like I did some exercise

The instructor, Mandy Ingber, talks you through the video, which is helpful. She says some funny things and makes the painful moments more bearable and fun.

I would definitely recommend this workout.
If you would like another recommendations, I'd go with Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown. I do these two dvds regularly and they def give me a workout! Another good one is the 15 minute workout with Mariel Hemingway and Rodney Yee. Skip the Denise Austin one. I wasn't impressed.",1316476800,2,1000,4.659090909090909

The series and flow would be great for any intermediate to advanced power yoga student, but the instructor fails to offer prompts throughout the sun salutation series.  So unless you have your eyes on the screen (which is difficult when you're in downward dog), the user can miss the visual cue to jump or step forward.  This happens a frustrating amount.  The only way it is workable is to simply give up on expecting to be told when to look up or jump forward and flow at your own pace.  I would recommend a Baron Baptiste yoga DVD over this one because Baptiste keeps a steady flow of instructions even when his students are inverted, so you always know how long you'll be in a posture and when to prepare to move.  I would definitely not recommend this video for anyone who is just starting out in power yoga; you'll just end up frustrated and possibly injured as you look up to determine what you should be doing.",1314576000,3,954,4.485549132947977

There is an option to turn off the narration--at least for the 30 minute workout. I like the flexibility that you can select the full hour, segments, or the shorter workout. Regardless, you can get a challenge, and she has options for those with knee and back issues. I got it for a song, and only 2 weeks of use 2-3 times per week helped me improve my scores on a military physical fitness test. Thumbs up.",1314230400,2,614,4.3478260869565215

I've purchased yoga DVDs in the past but had not found one that I like yet.  Some are awfully serious, and I don't want to look like the instructors.

Mandy offers a running commentary (also a version with music only) which is enjoyable and encouraging.  Just when my muscles were staarting to burn, she's offer up a goofy commentary, which was distracting from the burn.

Her ""mantra"" is a kick!  She says ""I have a great ass.""  I want mine to look like hers!  I wish Mandy were my personal yoga instructor, but I'm not moving to LA anytime soon, so this will do.

I have not yet tried the fully loaded challenge, because so far I'm happy with the 35 minute workout.  I like to do this workout before a run - did it before running a 10K and was not at all sore (except the soles of my feet!)

4330593,4,B004CYVZ1I,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.

YOGALOSOPHY purports to be a blend of traditional yoga postures and toning exercises.  The DVD features a 35-minute ""Express"" workout plus a longer ""Fully Loaded"" option; the latter adds ""Breakout Segments,"" or additional chapters which are also featured under the Extras submenu.  The Main Menu of the DVD reads as follows:

Introduction -- Mandy Ingber
Introduction -- Jennifer Aniston
Yogalosophy Express with Cuing
Yogalosophy Express with Music Alone
Fully Loaded Challenge
EXTRAS

Ingber is working out alone on a large patio-type area overlooking the ocean.  The background music is quite eclectic, a mix of vocals plus jazzy and almost techno tunes.  For the 35-minute Yogalosophy Express, Ingber oddly combines both live cuing and voiceover instruction, with names of the exercises appearing on the screen.  She states that she will be doing ""eight of everything,"" including eight breaths followed by eight repetitions and then eight pulses--this is the basic format, although Ingber sometimes deviates slightly from this pattern.  The exercises in the Express workout are as follows:  calf raises -- squats/crescent lunges -- temple/pli squats -- down dog w/leg lifts -- cat/cow -- fire hydrant -- bow -- superman -- plank/push-ups -- side plank -- floor tricep dips -- bridge/pelvic tilts -- reclined twist -- abs work (crunches into boat/v-ups) -- brief seated meditation.

As noted above, the Fully Loaded Challenge is an extended version of the Yogalosophy Express practice, as it includes add-on chapters which are listed under Extras.  The entire Extras submenu appears as follows (I have added approximate times in parentheses):

Sun Salutation (7.5 minutes)
Rock Block (3.5 minutes)
Balance Challenge (3 minutes)
Stretch (6 minutes)
Mandy on Breath (<1 minute)
Mandy on Yogalosophy (<1 minute)
Mandy on Vision Mat (2.5 minutes)

The first four of these segments are incorporated into the Fully Loaded Challenge practice.  The routine begins with the Sun Salutation.  Ingber takes the sun series at a nice, measured pace, adding a pause of five breaths in down dog and building up to hops forward/back as well as three-legged plank.  (Note:  it is easier to follow Ingber here if you have your mat perpendicular to your television rather than parallel to her.)  The ""Rock Block"" is a series of warrior poses which Ingber holds for five breaths per pose.  She moves through warrior 2, reverse warrior, and side angle, and then repeats the entire series on the other side.  Next is the Balance Challenge sequence.  Ingber begins with a knee hold, moving into tree pose and then continuing to balance on the same side for warrior 3 and front leg extension; she finishes on the second side.  Following the balance work, Ingber moves through the entire Yogalosophy Express portion.  Finally, she concludes with the Stretch segment.  The postures in this series include lunge, pigeon, one-legged forward bend, cobbler's forward bend, and full forward bend (no savasana), bringing the complete Fully Loaded Challenge to 55 minutes total.

I've been practicing yoga for almost ten years now; personally, I usually turn to yoga to stretch and relax, not to ""work out.""  Given this, I wasn't particularly expecting to enjoy this DVD, as I don't generally click with power yoga or other quick-moving vinyasa-style yoga practices.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that what Ingber offers is quite different.  I found that the toning exercises, which are performed at a moderate pace, flowed very nicely from the yoga postures, making this an excellent yoga practice for building strength.  I enjoyed the overall tempo and never felt that it was either rushed or too slow.  Of course, those who do tend to prefer fast-paced yoga practices are likely to be disappointed with this DVD.

There are several other caveats worth mentioning as well.  First of all, Ingber's cuing can be a bit difficult to follow, as she does not always alert the viewer to when she is switching to the next move/next side.  If you are used to counting on your own, that will help, as for the most part, Ingber does stick to the 8-count format; also, as noted above, turning your mat to face your television may be beneficial as well.  Another major issue is Ingber's personally, which came across as lighthearted and tongue-in-cheek to me but which might rub some people the wrong way.  The most salient example of this is during the squat sequence, when she states that she has a mantra that she uses:  that mantra is ""I have a great a--,"" which Ingber repeats several times.

In conclusion, I would recommend this DVD to those who do not take a purist approach to their yoga practice, who want a yoga routine that is challenging without being fast-moving, and finally, who do not mind some irreverence from their yoga instruction.",1305072000,151,4992,5.063647490820073

The moves are fine but the directions are too vague. You're constantly sacrificing the pose to look up at the tv and make sure you haven't missed the next pose.

I have a great ass"" over and over again, because I do yoga more to FEEL good and feel strong than to get a great ass. If she got a great ass, I guess that's a bonus. But it was a little irritating. That said, I'm not offended by off color words, it's just not the type of yoga mentality that I'm used to, but that's kind of the idea.  It's a new way of doing yoga - in her own unique way.
