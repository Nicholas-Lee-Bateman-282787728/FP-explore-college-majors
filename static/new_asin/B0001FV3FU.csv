SYNOPSIS--
Hikers take shelter from a rainstorm in a cave and meet an archaeologist (Nagel) who uses ancient wall art to tell them a story of two prehistoric tribes and of Turnak (Mature), son of the Rock tribe's chief and Loana (Landis) daughter of the Shell people's leader.

The Rocks are an ill-mannered, violent bunch while the Shells behave more peacefully. Loana teaches Turnak her peoples' ways, and ultimately both groups merge. But first there's monstrous earthbound and flying lizards, plus an earthquake and volcanic eruption to survive.

As of 5/09, ""One Million B.C."" was not available on DVD.
The superior 1966 remake, ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. stars Raquel Welch and has special effects by legendary Ray Harryhausen.

1996152,5,B0001FV3FU,"This movie is not a special effects extravaganza, the dinosaurs are not impressive, and the lapses in chronological realism are obvious.  What it does have, however, is a simple, very enduring story, one that has been told many times and in many different contexts.  Man, in essence, can transcend racial and sociological, even evolutionary, boundaries, when forced by a primeval environment, or nature's awesome power, to embrace his fellow human beings in order to survive, all differences be damned.  This is a simple, entertanining and wonderfully done, for the epoch, tale of how man's humanity to man must surface if, under the most trying circumstances, the human spirit, and the human species, is going to be able to survive and evolve, one primeval step at a time.",1204588800,11,773,5.070866141732283

1996167,5,B0001FV3FU,"As caveman movies go, 1966's One Million Years B.C. has had the top spot locked in for over 50 years.  Shot on the primordial Canary Islands, the film combined Ray Harryhausen's singular stop-motion dinosaurs with Raquel Welch's now-iconic fur bikini.  Produced by Hammer Films - and spawning a few lesser but still entertaining sequels - it was a match made in fantasy fan heaven.  But Tumak and Loana's prehistoric adventures actually began nearly 30 years earlier in the 1940 version of One Million Years B.C., starring Victor Mature and Carole Landis in the lead roles...and a terrarium full of lizards standing in for the carnivorous (and admittedly unconvincing) dinos.

Directed by Hal Roach, whose copious work in the silent film era ironically made him a perfect match for the dialogue-free material, rumors suggest the assistance of none other than D.W. Griffith behind the camera.  But whoever gets the credit, there's a lot of praise to be passed around.  From the whirling dervish camerawork to beautiful matte paintings and model-sized cataclysms, the film actually looks more polished than it's more cinematically advanced remake, with a creative stage-bound production design that echoes the best of King Kong's skull island sequences.

Those familiar with the Hammer version will find the story itself remarkably unchanged.  Tumak (Mature), part of a tribe of brutal Rock People, is kicked out of the clan by his own father (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.), only to fall into the arms of Loana (Landis) and her kinder, gentler tribe of Shell People.  Tumak's anger-issues and bad table manners put him a few rungs lower on the evolutionary ladder, but his survival skills are heralded by all when he fights offs a dinosaur that's been pestering the village.  Jealousy, however, soon sends he and Loana packing, where they fight off even more oversized reptiles, only to wind up back with the Rock People, whose crude lifestyle is in desperate need of an upgrade.

Both films end with a volcanic eruption, but Roach's staging has the edge.  In fact, the bubbling lava and heaving landscape shots were recycled frequently by other productions looking to save a buck.  It's a real showstopper that almost makes up for the phony ""lizard-saurus"" special effects used throughout the rest of the film.  Similar to later efforts like Irwin Allen's The Lost World, even small children would be unconvinced by slapping a dorsal fin atop an alligator or monitor lizard.  But the scenes are photographed so well, with some amazing compositions that put our cave people in jeopardy, one is able to appreciate the technical skill that went into overcoming the budget limitations.

That said, One Million B.C. never looks cheap; it's a lavishly designed production from start to finish.  Even the modern-day prologue, involving a team of Alpine explorers stumbling to safety inside an archeological cave site, starts the movie off on an atmospheric note.  Relatively rare in its complete form, this newly restored print from the UCLA film archives will be a revelation for most fantastic film fans.  The hi-def transfer is so clean and detailed, it's like finding a complete T-Rex fossil in your backyard.  Extras include a large still gallery and well-informed audio commentary by Toby Roan.",1513468800,3,3289,5.11214953271028
1996168,3,B0001FV3FU,"One Million B.C. is set in the prehistoric age. Dinosaurs, punishing nature and an erupting volcano are obstacles young Tumak (Victor Mature) must deal with, as well as trying to unite the uncivilized Rock Tribe and the peaceful Shell Tribe. Carole Landis plays Loana, daughter of the Shell Tribe chief, and Lon Chaney, Jr. takes time off from his horror films to star as Tumaks rigid father and leader of the Rock Tribe.

This Romeo & Juliet romance is amusing to watch today, with its special effects as primitive as its setting. It was one of the first films to incorrectly depict dinosaurs living in the same period as early man, but dinosaurs were a big draw, especially a few years after King Kong thrilled audiences. Unfortunately, producer Hal Roach lacked the budget to create stop motion dinosaurs  and relied instead on real lizards, photographed in close-up to look enormous and optically combined with the actors. The effects are hardly convincing by todays standards, but it did receive receive an Oscar nomination for its special effects.

Victor Mature set the template for actors such as Steve Reeves who, a decade and a half later, made a series of popular action adventures, always bare chested. One Million B.C. has a thin plot, and is more a travelogue of life in the prehistoric world than a satisfying action drama. The romantic slant seems forced and is not at all convincing, but it still packs some thrills for the twelve-year-old in all of us.

Bonus materials on the Blu-ray release include a photo gallery, commentary track, and original promotional recording.",1513123200,,1589,4.940074906367041
1996169,5,B0001FV3FU,"UCLA Film Archives did a great job restoring this film. There isn't a blemish to be seen and the image is very sharp. Certainly this is the best the movie has looked since it came out in 1940. I was surprised at how closely the famous Hammer Films remake followed the original, until the last 15 minutes or so. One Million B.C. is an underrated classic. Hopefully this new VCI release will garner it the respect it deserves.",1512691200,3,424,4.448717948717949

1996175,5,B0001FV3FU,extremely excellent film.  Showcases Victor Mature and Carole Landis to excellent advantage.  Remade in 1966 by Hammer Films with Raquel Welch.,1508716800,,143,5.761904761904762
1996176,3,B0001FV3FU,"Ive never been a huge fan of caveman movies but I recognize that they have their place. For me the two best were ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. because, well, it had Raquel Welch in a skimpy outfit and I had just hit puberty. The other as CAVEMAN with Ringo Starr, a hilarious movie that should be sought out. That being said I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie.

The film opens with a group of lederhosen travelers seeking shelter in a cave while hiking only to find an archeologist inside checking out some markings on the wall. To pass the time he begins to interpret them for the group. Naturally those in his story look like members of this group.

The story is fairly simple yet fills the movies time well. Were introduced to a tribe of rock dwelling cavemen who have little concern for one another. Its a rule by strength caste system. Our hero is Tumak (Victor Mature), the son of the tribes leader. This tribe wanders in search of food with tree limbs as clubs. When Tumak kills an animal and they go to eat, he offends his father and is banished from the tribe.

Tumak wanders and fall unconscious into a river which takes him downstream. There he is discovered by Loana (Carole Landis), a member of the shell tribe. She calls for help and she and her tribe take him back to their cave. Once awake Tumak finds this tribe completely different from his own. They share food, help one another and have fashioned spears from the branches and stones theyve found.

Eventually Tumak falls prey to his old way of doing things and steals a spear from a tribe member. This causes Loanas father, the head of the tribe, to cast him out. Tumak takes Loana with him and they are on their own. They come across two dinosaurs fighting one another and when Tumak sends Loana for cover, she is found by his old tribe. Tumak comes to her rescue and begins to teach his old tribe the lessons he has learned from Loanas. An eventual unification of the two tribes is in the works and if you didn't see it coming right from the start youve not seen many movies.

So is the movie any good? Is it entertaining? The easy answer is yes to both questions. One has to take into consideration that the movie was made back in 1940 long before CGI created creatures took over movie screens. A combination of animals and people in costumes as well as rear projection footage of larger lizards made to appear enormous made this film a spectacle for audiences of the day. So much so that the film was nominated for an Oscar for special effects.

The dialogue once we get into the story could be posted on two pages if that. It is the visual story that is going on here not the words being spoken. This provides a chance for actors to perform with their body language and motions rather than their oratory skills. And it works quite well.

The print being offered here is the best available and probably not seen this way since the film was originally released. Digitally restored by VCI you won't find a better presentation. This version also has a commentary track by film expert Toby Roan as one of the few extras. There is also a stills gallery with tons of ad artwork and stills from the film.

This might not be the first item you pick up off a shelf to purchase when you go shopping but for film fans it will be something to treasure. Its a piece of film history, more so than the story it tells.",1508716800,7,3379,4.37799043062201

1996179,5,B0001FV3FU,"Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  I remember seeing this movie in the 40's and loved it.  Of course, it was through the lens of a 10 year old kid, While the later version of this movie is technically better, with better effects, etc.  in its simplicity, I love the 40's version better.
There is a sincerity in the acting, the story-line that was so true of movies in the 30's and the 40's that disappeared when technology improved.
Didn't know that this was Victor Mature's earliest movie and he is great!
Simple emotions, simple story line, and great acting is what this version is all about.  I never dreamed I would be able to see this again since it hasn't even been available in  bootleg copies sold by many companies.
I am grateful to go back to my 40's childhood and revisit my happy childhood.  While this movie was not award-winning, it was a perfect movie for a 10 year old kid who would remember it for the rest of his life.  Different strokes for different folks!

1996182,3,B0001FV3FU,"This is an adventure filled prehistoric movie where you will also come across many scary creatures and wild fights of cavemen and very little conversation. The story is about two prehistoric people; one, the brutish rock people, and second, the peaceful shell people. This film, produced by Hal Roach has many scientific inaccuracies. One million years ago, there were no humans, in fact humans are around for a little more than 100,000 years and the dinosaurs were extinct 65 million years ago. They couldn't be in a movie that was about one million years ago, and how come that the cavemen have a domesticated dog? Notwithstanding these inaccuracies, it still generated lot of interest in 1940 when this movie was released, partly because it is a fantasy with lot of action. When I saw the fights and brutality with all those monster creatures, it made me remember another horror movie, King Kong (1932). The special effects of King Kong is lot better than this movie. Overall, this movie is OK to watch, and Carol Landis and Lon Chaney Jr. do wonderful jobs in their roles. For a pre-historic movie, Carol Landis is surprisingly fully clothed with almost no nudity in the film.",1405555200,11,1180,4.846534653465347
8011821,4,B0001FV3FU,"At last someone has put out a viewable version of this Caveman classic. While by no means a great film it still has its moments and a starring role for Victor Mature in his second film plus Carole Landis, and Lon Chaney Jr. as the brutish head of the cave clan. The special effects consist of using alligators and lizards with fins glued to their backs to represent dinosaurs Irwin Allen style. The highlight is the fight scene between an alligator and another reptile that has a finish that looks all too real. This sequence would be featured in many a B-film made later on in the 40's and 50's whenever they needed to pad out the running time on one of their prehistoric quickies. When all is said and done the film still elicits charm and innocence and the 2 leads have a nice chemistry. The Bluray picture is for the most part pristine and undoubtedly the best copy thus far. So if you like cheesy dinosaur flicks then don't miss this cult caveman vs dinosaur classic.",1524614400,,972,4.466292134831461

Extras include a photo gallery and commentary by Toby Roan. Given the status and reputation of the film I would have liked an informative booklet, but you can't have everything!. The film? Frankly I was just a bit disapointed. I haven't seen it for possibly 20 or more years and I had forgotten, looked at today, how, miscast Mature and Landis are. Victor gurns and looks baffled and has good stunt double, but in no way convinced me. Poor Carole Landis (an actress I like) just doesn't work. On the other hand... Plenty of viewers don't agree! I found the SFX very good and the matching of monsters and characters worked well. Sets are imaginative and quite threatening. I also feel obliged to say that I found one of the fights between (real?) lizards rather too unpleasant, but I am a softie (sometimes). All in all this is a classic of it's kind and well worth a look, though what first time viewers might think - who knows. I mentioned subtitles...You may not need them. There is a prologue with actors about 6-8 mins, but when we go back in time there are just grunts for 80 minutes and seeing ""Greuff"", Neecha"" Banoona"" etc many times can get a bit annoying!",1518134400,3,1304,4.600858369098712
