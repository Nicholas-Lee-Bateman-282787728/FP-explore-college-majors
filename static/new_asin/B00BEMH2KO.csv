5609311,5,B00BEMH2KO,"Simenon would be pleased by the performances given by Bruno Cremer in this series. The supporting staff is outstanding, as well, and the background bring a strong aura of realism to most of the episodes. If you have not yet met Chief Superintendent Maigret, you are missing one of the most believable characters on DVD. Simply put, these are the best detective stories you can find on DVD.",1368144000,2,389,4.735294117647059

5609313,2,B00BEMH2KO,"I just purchased this set of Maigret episodes and was disappointed to see that the distributor did a poor job in packaging these DVDs. The box cover for the first 3 episodes (43-45) was incorrect. It is instead a duplicate of the box cover for the last 3 episodes (46-48). I have tried to contact the distributor, MHz Networks, but they have failed to respond to my messages and email.",1365724800,4,385,4.514285714285714

5609329,5,B00BEMH2KO,"The Great French Actor Bruno Cremer IS Inspector Maigret.  Set in the early 50s just after the war this series captures the seedy aspects of France before it became a tourist mecca. The culture, the language, the mores, the people of France - always fascinating and alluring.  Highly recommend this entire series! the mysteries are truly puzzling; Maigret has a special talent that figures out who did what.  I watch while on my treadmill; I have to read the subtitles anyway so...  Keeps me walking, running, walking...",1405555200,,520,4.942528735632184

and his compassionate side comes through as well.",1402444800,,157,4.448275862068965
5609331,5,B00BEMH2KO,"A much needed version of Georges Simenon in the vernacular, so to speak. Subtitles are a little odd but then you'll be speaking French by the end anyway so who needs 'em?",1394323200,,170,4.34375
