7785785,5,B01HDHA9GW,"Amazing concert with great sound. I love Justin's commentary throughout and the story behind the songs. The bonus track, The Wind of Heaven music video is simply breathtaking. It's worth getting this DVD for just that song.",1468713600,7,223,5.054054054054054

7785798,5,B01HDHA9GW,"Justin alone with just his two wonderful backups is better even than the Moody Blues together, and this DVD is terrific, though the BluRay of another recent concert is slightly better.  Wish this were BluRay too, but N/A.  What a voice and what an ear for beautiful melodies.  Progressive Rock at its finest.",1502236800,,308,4.773584905660377

7785801,5,B01HDHA9GW,"If you love Justin Hayward and the Moody Blues, this is a must have. Mike Dawes guitar work is amazing. Justin's version's of classic MB tunes is top notch. I am personally very pleased with the purchase.",1490486400,,204,4.54054054054054
7785802,3,B01HDHA9GW,"I hesitate to say anything negative about one of my favorite artists - a true master - but I have to ask ""why?"" about this disc. I think most of it was done better, earlier on ""Spirits Live"". You will get a few more of the new songs, if that is what you're most interested in, but I thought ""Spirits"" was a lot more fun and entertaining. In my humble opinion the camerawork was better, the editing was snappier and the sound mix was better. It also had four performers instead of three - the extra keyboard added greater richness to the sound. And it also included an extra hourlong documentary on Justin on tour which was interesting and educational. And a color booklet! ""Capitol"" is OK, but I'd rather watch ""Spirits"".",1488585600,11,721,4.46969696969697
7785803,2,B01HDHA9GW,"I bought my copy directly through Justin's website. I was also at this concert and was excited to see it was recorded and released. Likewise I was dismayed at it not being available as a blu-ray. The video quality is just ""OK"". On the back of the DVD case this release claims to be a ""DVD9"" which means it is a dual layer DVD able to contain over 8 gigabytes of video and audio,. Much to my surprise there are only 3.9 gigabytes of data on the disk. This means it is not even a full DVD5 and is half the quality (video bitrate) of a DVD9. Maybe there was a screw up in the original recording or it was process incorrectly. This might explain why there was no blu-ray. The Spirits Live blu-ray disk is 38 gigabytes as it should be. Sad that this product falls short. On the bright side it's better than a cellphone video or nothing at all. I sent an email to David Minasian to see what the explanation is for such a low bitrate. Maybe it can be corrected and we could get replacement disks. Fingers crossed.",1488240000,3,1006,4.217616580310881

7785813,5,B01HDHA9GW,David Justin Hayward is one of the finest musicians and vocalists to evolve from the British rock 'n roll music era.,1483142400,,116,4.571428571428571
7785814,5,B01HDHA9GW,Justin is one of the all time great singer songwriter guitar players and I've felt that way for more than 37 years. I've seen him play live a couple times with this small group and enjoyed every minute so it's nice to be able to recreate those experiences. This and his Coach House show are among my favorite live dvds. If you combine these with a burned disc of his three songs on every Moodies disc from the 60's and 70's you'll have a great overview of some of his best work which is second to none.,1482537600,,502,4.185567010309279
7785815,5,B01HDHA9GW,"It was tempting to give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the format.  Where is the Blu-ray?  The concert is excellent, especially Justin performing songs that I've waited a long time to see him perform in a setting such as this, i.e. I Dreamed Last Night.  Perhaps ""Driftwood"" will be added to his next concert set list.  Anything from Justin is welcomed, but please give us Blu-ray's & HiRes Audio.  If you have a copy of ""Spirits LIve"" which is available on Blu-ray and enjoyed it, this concert is similar and makes a nice addition to any Justin / Moodies fans collection.",1481846400,,578,4.519230769230769

7785817,5,B01HDHA9GW,"This is a great concert by one of our finest singer-songwriters. At 70 years of age Justin still has a beautiful voice and his lyrics are timeless. He sings plenty of Moody Blues standards as well as a good selection from his 2013 solo album Spirits of the Western Sky. He is accompanied by Julie Ragins, who also plays with the Moody Blues, on keyboards, percussion and outstanding backing vocals. Mike Dawes is a genius guitarist and really makes Justin's concerts special.",1481328000,2,475,4.804878048780488
7785818,5,B01HDHA9GW,"Plain delighted that we periodically get to enjoy new releases albeit not all tracks are new compositions.  It's just as lovely to have fresh collections of old tunes revisited and rearranged.  Obviously the songs on this setlist are significant to the songwriter; it's a pleasure to listen to them again nostalgically and with that added insight.  This is an artist who has an affection for his oeuvre, remains engaged in his craft, and continues to evolve 55 years into hitting the boards.  Respect his commitment and longevity, as well as the fact that he still tours and seems to enjoy it more so staging it his way in intimate venues.",1481328000,,639,4.781818181818182

7785838,5,B01HDHA9GW,"This is another great concert film by Justin Hayward, produced by David Minasian, in between his Moody Blues tours. Basically this is a repeat of the Spirits Live format,  with some new songs thrown in the mix, and a little story telling by Justin in between songs. Mike Dawes and Julie Ragins are on stage with Justin once again. The concert was recorded in Clearwater Florida, to a very receptive audience. The song listing is as follows. 1. Tuesday Afternoon 2. It's Up To You/ Lovely To See You 3. In Your Blue Eyes 4. The Western Sky 5. You Can Never Go Home 6. Watching and Waiting 7. I Dreamed Last Night 8. One Day Someday 9. The Eastern Sun 10. December Snow 11. What You Resist Persists 12. Your Wildest Dreams 13. Forever Autumn 14. Question 15. Nights In White Satin 16. I know You're Out There Somewhere 17. Blue Guitar 18. Who Are You Now. And includes the Bonus Music Video, The Wind Of Heaven, which is a new and beautiful song well worth the price of the DVD for Justin Hayward fans. All in all this is a very enjoyable concert. Justin's voice only seems to improve with age. His vocals are always spot on, as is his guitar. And with Mike Dawes complimenting Justin on guitar, and Julie Ragins on keyboard and backup vocals, it's more like being at a Moodies concert doing a semi acoustic set. For True fans of the Moody Blues, and Justin Hayward, you'll want this one in your collection too. I have every one Justin has ever released, as well as the Moody Blues, and I can honestly say I enjoyed every minute of this DVD. I'm sure you will too.",1478476800,12,1562,4.367697594501718

7785842,5,B01HDHA9GW,"Would Say, Up and personal, a Very Exceptional Performance. I Have Been a ""The Moody Blues"" FAN Since the 70's and Definitively, the Poetry Written by Mr. Hayward, Qualifies Him in the History Records in This World for His Philosophical Terms and for His Level of Conscience as A Human Being, Being Far Above;  Some and Some, More over the Thousands of Years of We Have Inhabited Earth, This Wonderful Place that Many Seek to Destroy, but Very Few Seek to Live By and Save and  To Me, Mr. Hayward Represents Humanity in His Compositions, and So do all The Moody Blue fans As well, and All The Members of the Group. Wish, I would Have Been at This Concert, but Listening to it Brought Many Memories back. I Own the Seven and the Eight on CD's and a Couple of Others after That. There's Mr. Hayward in one of the Newest of his Explaining Where He and His Brother Share a Room, and Looking out Composure later Came; Pretty Cool, He Will Link You and You Will become Human Once Again. Then, Again Very Personal. Enjoy  SEE IT . Really Enjoy It !",1477785600,6,1041,4.355670103092783
7785843,5,B01HDHA9GW,Very good concert. I really like the stripped down arrangements of many of my favorite songs of his.,1477699200,,100,4.611111111111111
7785844,5,B01HDHA9GW,"If you are a Justin Hayward fan, you will love this show. It was shot at  The Capitol Theatre in Clearwater, Florida. I actually attended this show. I saw the camera guys many times, but didn't realize it was being filmed for a DVD. Imagine my surprise when I saw this for sale and saw myself in the ""movie"" The set list is great. Including many Moody Blues classics and songs from Justin's solo career, including ""Forever Autumn""  an all time favorite that I thought I would never hear live. I have been a Moody Blues fan for 50 years and would go see them (or him) again any time. His voice just gets better and better. (He just turned 70) Love The Moody Blues, love Justin...highly recommended.",1477440000,22,697,4.4375
7785845,5,B01HDHA9GW,This is an incredible DVD from start to finish. If you love the Moody Blues and Justin Hayward you will enjoy this wonderful concert given by him. I saw him in person last year and now I can enjoy it any time thanks to this concert release. His voice is just as good and strong as it was when the Moodies first came on the music scene.,1477353600,2,335,4.014925373134329

7785849,5,B01HDHA9GW,"I bought one of these previously, but then bought two more for gifts through Amazon. It is similar to Spirits Live, but still different enough to enjoy. I LOVE having the video presentation of The Wind of Heaven on there. I have watched it over and over many times, and it has become one of my favorite songs by Justin Hayward. There is plenty of other good music on this DVD in addition to that special song. The friend who I gave it to also has enjoyed the DVD immensely. It is so much fun to know that you can give this DVD with complete confidence knowing it will be enjoyed by almost everyone.

I also recently obtained Justin's CD All the Way with the same song and enjoy hearing that, as well as many other good songs.",1476576000,3,725,4.253623188405797

7785852,5,B01HDHA9GW,"Justin's voice is still great and the acoustic format gives the older songs a new twist without losing the original arrangements.

7785854,5,B01HDHA9GW,"Absolutely a five-star DVD with a five-star performance by veteran rocker Justin Hayward and his very talented back-up band, musician/singer Julie Raggins and guitar virtuoso Mike Dawes. The tunes are varied enough to encapsulate some of Hayward's solo efforts, a couple of collaborations, as well as well-known and well-loved Moody Blues favorites and also some deeper cuts. For long-time Moody Blues fans as well as more casual fans or anyone who appreciates great music and great performers. The whole thing is so beautifully done, you can't help but be moved by it.",1474934400,3,569,5.195652173913044
7785855,5,B01HDHA9GW,"5/27/18 additional comment. I previously commented about the lack of an HD offering. Well i just grabbed the HD download from Amazon Video and it looks pretty darn good. (Original posting) Superb, just like the Spirits Live concert, mostly the same music, but a handful of different songs,on a different night, different pants and shirt and it's all good. Don't get me wrong. I love this stuff and have zero complaints. I would buy it again in a nanosecond. I have seen the Moodies maybe 7 times all the way back to 1970. The Moodies I knew and loved on stage ceased being the Moodies over 20 years ago and became almost like a tribute band. They didn't look like the Moodies any more and John Lodge's music is a little too starry eyed, lovey kissey, schmaltzy ""head in the clouds"" for me, (sorry John Lodge lovers) but Justin still has it. Now a days, this and Spirits Live is as close as we will come to a Moodies performance from the man who wrote and sung the lions share of what we remember from the classic Moodies era.  While the ""DVD only"" release looks almost Blu Ray quality, I still want to know why there is no Blu Ray available?",1474848000,17,1141,4.407582938388626
7785856,5,B01HDHA9GW,"Another excellent concert film by David Minasian, For those who have been to one of Justin Hayward's recent solo shows this will bring back great memories...and for those who haven't been to one of the shows, this dvd is the next best thing to ""being there"".

8765064,5,B01HDHA9GW,"I have to state up front that I have been a Moody Blues fan since 1969 when the magical sounds of On The Threshold Of A Dream poured across my bedroom when I was 17 years old.  I've aged since then, but my love for the Moody Blues and Justin Hayward have only grown as I've crossed the inevitable life transitions of love and loss.  Nostalgia matters more these days perhaps than before.  In any case, this DVD is pure magic.  If you want to be transported back to those days when life was a bit simpler and filled with hope, it really just takes one play of this DVD.  I am beyond amazed at how Justin, Julie, and Mike are able to recreate the sound of a complete band with such incredible fidelity.  I could go on and on about what makes this DVD so special, but beauty is always in the eye of the beholder.  For less than the cost of a movie for two, you can take a journey back in time with these 17 songs, presented with all the grace and beauty that the Moody Blues did back in the day.  Special kudos to Julie Ragins and Mike Dawes for honoring this music with impeccable musicianship.  I can not imagine that any Moodies fan would be disappointed in this compilation of some of the most touching songs that Justin Hayward ever wrote.
