7970142,4,B00006JDRR,"Carry On Constable was hysterical - and much better than I had expected.  However, Carry On Teacher really missed the mark by a mile.  Enjoyable to watch - but nothing up to CARRY ON CONSTABLE or CARRY ON SEARGENT or CARRY ON DOCTOR.  Later in the series there were some hits and misses - but I didn't expect this ""miss"" so early on in the series.",1423008000,,347,4.2272727272727275
7970143,5,B00006JDRR,"Two hysterical movies, it is British humor at it's best. Carry on Constable has a good story line and great cast. Carry on Teacher was slow at first but turned into hilarious fun. Both well worth the money if you like British comedies.",1390435200,4,235,4.488372093023256
7970144,3,B00006JDRR,"The ""Carry On"" series was a long running (31 movie) series of British comedies featuring good natured but daft characters with a lot of slapstick, comedic misunderstanding, not bright characters, and at times almost constant mayhem. Even a confirmed Anglophile like my wife tires of them quickly ... Bernie and Wooster they are not.

In Carry On Teacher, a student body goes to great lengths to keep a beloved teacher from being offered a job elsewhere. In Carry On Constable, three inept replacement Constables fill in during a flu epidemic, and don't get much effective crime fighting done.

The comedy style is very reminiscent of The Three Stooges, which you may be more familiar with. There is less overt bopping on the noggin than the stooges, but also fewer direct laughs in my opinion. However, the same sense of out of control events pervades both sets of films.

If you must have these, I would certainly recommend that you find the low priced used sets to purchase.",1316131200,7,976,4.832335329341317
7970145,4,B00006JDRR,"First saw this many years ago and laughed and laughed at the picture of teaching it portrayed.  I still love it, but the advances in cinema production and writing make this a little out-dated.",1221350400,2,192,4.647058823529412
7970146,4,B00006JDRR,"Carry On Teacher was the third entry into the long-running British comedy film series and was an amusing one at that. The series was well underway having enjoyed International success with its predecessor, Carry On Nurse. This is a gentle, light-hearted comedy, distinctley reminiscent of the St. Trinians series. When a headmaster of a school decides to leave for a new post, the pupils do everything to sabotage his chances because of his firm popularity with them. Two school inspectors arrive, both with diverse ideas on discipline (Rosalind Knight and Leslie Phillips) to assess Mr. Wakefields (the headmaster - played by Ted Ray) progress with the school. And so cue all the predicatble slap stick mayhem such as the staff getting hopelessly drunk after the staffs tea is laced with alcohol, doors falling down when opened, superglue on chairs etc. Predictable yes, but good clean, old-fashioned fun that still manages to raise a smile. Amongst the cast are some of the familiar Carry On faces such as Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Charles Hawtrey, Hattie Jaques (playing a ferocious, no-nonsense school mistress) and Kenneth Connor playing his usual bumbling, accident-prone self which became something of his trademark throughout the series. The ending has a surprising twist of sentimentality and although this entry could hardly be anything else but a Carry On film, it still is quite untypical of some of the later entries in the series.
Carry On Constable was a turning point in the series as it marked the first apperance of Sid James. Surprisingly he doesn't play his usual rogue-like, lecherous old man role as he always did in later entries, instead playing a fair, down-to-earth, good old fashioned policeman who is continually undermined by his superior. Still his performance was a breeze of fresh air in the series. This is basically Carry On Sergeant transferred to a police station. None of it is beleavable of course, but there is certainly plenty of fun to endure and this is perharps one of the best of the black and white Carry On's. Leslie Phillips, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey and Kenneth Connor, all play the blatantly incompetent trainee police-officers who make a mockery of virtually every task they're given but all turns out good in the end of course - after all this is a Carry On film. Amongst the rest of the cast include Joan Sims as super-efficent WPC Gloria Pasworthy (who Kenneth Connor falls hopelessly in love with in the film), Hattie Jaques as a down-to-earth, understanding officer who enjoys a close friendship with Sid James and an amusing cameo from Joan Hickson playing a loveable, typically English eccentric who is forever drunk and getting arrested on drunken-disorderley charges.
Carry On Teacher and Carry On Constable features the series in its prime. Both are as corny as ever and distinctley British but the cozy, old-fashioned feel of the films have an undeniable timeless quality. Recommended.",1035849600,16,2958,5.088477366255144
