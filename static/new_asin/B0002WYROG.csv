2128672,4,B0002WYROG,"This entertaining DVD by Greg Koch shows a man with great chops instructing how to play some of his (mostly) intricate, varied in style, original songs. he plays each song with his band and then shows how he gets some of his licks and sounds. You'd want to be a damn good player to watch this and then be able to do what he does. For me, a pretty average amateur player, there's not much that is going to help improve my playing, but there are some techniques worth a try. But the man is funny and he sure can play.

2128673,5,B0002WYROG,"This is a great DVD.  The guitar style spectrum is covered here with country, blues, and rock, with tips and tricks to enhance your own style.  Greg uses Fender Strats and Telecasters (my favorite guitars) throughout the video and explains and demonstrates his unique style in a way that you can pick up on with a little practice and not be totally discouraged.  This DVD is filled with humor, great teaching and superb pointers for expanding your technique.  If you are a fan of Greg Koch or would want to make your playing really stand out, you need this video.",1135468800,11,563,4.6
8033792,2,B0002WYROG,Disappointing. Not like his you tube videos. It is gristle - not meat.,1439251200,,70,4.461538461538462
8033793,5,B0002WYROG,"If you like Greg Koch tunes and want a little behind-the-scenes for some of his more well know stuff, this is a great DVD.  A delve into the mind of the master. I like the DVD vs his books a little bit more because you get to see what he's doing first hand, really watch as he breaks things down, as well as having some insights from the man himself as to what he is thinking and how he is approaching certain concepts.",1436140800,,419,4.048192771084337
8033794,3,B0002WYROG,It works!  but could use some better written material,1414108800,,53,4.888888888888889
8033795,5,B0002WYROG,"To start with Greg Koch is a very gifted guiter wizard. He makes me laugh watching him play with his crazy comics which makes it fun. If you try his DVD you must be a very good player to be able to play like him. He packs in alot on every DVD. I like this guy. This is not for beginners.

8033796,5,B0002WYROG,"There is a world full ''GREAT'' musicians, but Greg's humor injected personality definitely sets him apart. I attended one of his seminars. He is a master on his instrument and very enjoyable to be around.'' GUITAR GRISTLE '' is what Greg is all about.",1386460800,,252,4.75
8033797,5,B0002WYROG,Tasty licks from the master of Gristle.  Koch is always entertaining and plays a great guitar.  Not for beginners For sure,1382227200,,122,4.761904761904762
8033798,4,B0002WYROG,"The kind of stuff that I want to learn from Greg.  Bluesy, rock, weird sounding but still rooted and classic.  Not jazz, not fusion.

The only I would have added is a tab sheet to make the learning faster.  Even though Greg explains all the tricks and licks slowly, still the fingering is not easy to figure out sometimes.  For guys like me that do not have much time to study a tab would speed learning the fingering up a bit.",1369612800,,427,4.222222222222222
8033799,4,B0002WYROG,"Greg is a very good teacher, I found it easy to follow along.
I am going t o purchase a few of his other video's.",1252022400,,113,3.56
8033800,4,B0002WYROG,"To say Greg is wacky is an understatement, I'm pretty sure he's completely insane and is indeed ""a beast of the night, if you will...""

Always entertaining and helpful, Greg packs a lot of information in this 1hr 12 minutes of skullduggery.

Greg works though 6 of his tunes (Zoinks, Spank It, Torn Asunder, Death Of A Bassman, Tonus Diabolicus and Chief's Blues) and within the context of these tunes covers topics as varied as; Fun with a B Bender, Chicken & Hybrid Picking, Behind the Nut shenanigans, The blues (how to play them and avoid giving them) and so on.

Each group of techniques he discusses is demonstrated in a band setting then it's close up intimate time with Greg as he walks you slowly through the licks, sometimes even showing you extensions or other options for licks he played in the band setting.

While this is definitely not a beginners video, for intermediate to advanced players there so much to work with here, learn the tune or just pick up some cool licks here and there, it's up to you. All in all, the greasy guitar gristle Greg dishes out is well worth the look and listen.

Guitar Debauchery at its finest!

Rating: 4 out of 5.

Hang on, why not 5?  Has nothing whatsoever to do with Greg. The DVD seems poorly authored, at the end of two of the sections the menu system fails to return you to the songs menu which I find odd since it works for other selections. More annoyingly however is that sometimes it is hard to make out what Greg says if he's not talking directly into the lav mic. The difference in levels is so astounding that you have to ask yourself if the mix engineer has ever heard of compression. Nit picking for an instructional DVD I know, but still.",1219708800,5,1703,4.453376205787781
8033801,5,B0002WYROG,I really liked this dvd.  I have followed Greg's column in GuitarOne for some time that basically motivated me to purchase this dvd. Greg plays some tunes from his cd and then breaks it all down and shows you how to do his licks. He covers most styles of playing you will learn some cool tricks from his lessons.,1168473600,2,312,4.288135593220339
