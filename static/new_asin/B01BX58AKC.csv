7670845,5,B01BX58AKC,"The odd, inspiring and bittersweet true life family mystery stumbled into by film-maker and artist Jane Anderson (note  Anderson didn't direct this documentary, her own family's story, but she did co-write and produce, and serves  charmingly  as our on-camera guide through the tale).

Anderson grew up inspired by the art of her great aunt Edith, but not knowing much about her.  Now, many years later, Anderson is slowly unraveling Ediths story, finding she had life that was as full of twists and turns as a fiction novel.  Among the key elements; Edith had a female companion for many years, and the implication is that Edith was very likely gay, something that would not have gone over well with her upper class family and their acquaintances of the time.  Connected to that perhaps  or perhaps not  was Ediths being committed to a mental institution in 1924 at age 57 by a seemingly crooked family lawyer, and basically disappearing from the face of the earth thereafter.

While the film cant answer all the mysteries of Ediths journey, its fascinating, touching and fun  watching Jane and her wife Tess slowly uncovering bits and pieces of Ediths story  her happy days as a young but ever more accomplished an influential artist in Provincetown, as well as finding pieces of Ediths terrific work that had been squirreled away or 'lost' in attacks and trunks after it was all taken from her when she was committed.

A tale of discovery, self-discovery and re-discovery that is touching, sweet, and in its own quiet way, quite amazing.",1460332800,4,1540,4.899613899613899
8751878,5,B01BX58AKC,Loved the movie and ordered cards with her paintings on them. Love her style.,1518220800,,77,4.571428571428571
8751879,5,B01BX58AKC,"I had never heard of the outstanding artist, Edith Lake Wilkinson, and I bet you have never heard of her either.  The hunt to find out what happened to her and her art is a journey worth taking.  Wish I could see Edith's work in person.  Stunning colors and intriguing life story. Enjoy.",1514246400,,287,4.377358490566038

8751882,5,B01BX58AKC,"An artist's story, a woman's story. Riveting! We have come so far in fifty years, but the stories of those who came before must be found, told, and remembered.",1502755200,,159,4.517241379310345

8751884,3,B01BX58AKC,"I'm not giving away plot since it is a documentary but I will be noting specific points so I guess that still constitutes spoilers.

For the first half of the film it felt self-serving for Jane Anderson. She reminded me of one of those people who you can tell them of an experience you've had and they can tell you the same thing that happened to them and proceed to tell you in detail their own story. What little she knows and shares of Edith somehow comes back to Jane. Just about the moment I would be ready to turn it off, the focus would go back to Edith. However, I was still ready to turn it off since it was all speculation when it suddenly got interesting.

The film's greatest flaw is trying to tell a story about a woman that little is known. Even though evidence is shown that she was at the heart of the Provincetown art community creation in 1915, she has been written out of the history so 98% of what is discussed is speculation. Jane uses phrases like, ""You can imagine..."" or ""Edith would be..."" but this is not fact. Jane hires a ""renowned"" psychic to try to get answers from Edith -- that was ten wasted minutes of a psychic who obviously knows her mark.

Right around the half-way mark up until the psychic the focus remains mainly on Edith, her artwork and historical art movement of Provincetown. It is a fascinating study of a woman who may have had her rightful place in art history stolen whether intentionally or not. Since speculation runs rampant in this documentary, I would speculate towards not since Edith seems to have been forgotten by the very community she associated with for years. When shown in group pictures, she stands towards the back or, even if in the middle, seems more like a wallflower. Amongst her fellow artists she may have not been noticed by many or forgotten when she was gone for many years. Who knows? No one watching the film. Basically, I wouldn't attribute it to anything nefarious.

While they tried to make a case that she was put away into an asylum because of her homosexuality, the fact that her lifestyle had been consistent for many years without issue and she was only put away when she was wanting a lifestyle that would hamper George Rodgers (the trustee of her accounts) ability to continue siphoning money from her accounts, it is a more plausible reasoning that he had her committed to cover up his crime. It is also more plausible when you consider that the reason for incarceration was paranoia. If she was claiming the lawyer was stealing from her and he was saying, ""See what I mean -- I'm taking care of her and she thinks I'm stealing"", then it stands to reason the asylum would trust a male lawyer over a female artist. Essentially, I think Jane made a bigger deal out of Edith's homosexuality as a way to, yet again, bring the narrative back to herself.

The film had some redeeming qualities so I wouldn't give it less than three stars but four or five stars is too much for a documentary that falls short on facts.",1499126400,,2998,4.483516483516484
8751885,5,B01BX58AKC,This is one of my most favorite documentaries ever. I absolutely love Edith's work and the love that Jane Anderson and her wife obviously have for her. This documentary is such a beautiful way to honor her legacy. I've ordered three of Edith's paintings and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of more. This is truly Must See TV.,1491523200,,326,4.637931034482759
8751886,3,B01BX58AKC,"Fact is there is a body of artistic work created by a woman who was locked away in 1924 for an unspecified mental illness and who died in captivity. There is a lawyer who put her away and drained her bank account. These are the facts as presented.

But this documentary does not focus on the work itself - the only tangible evidence that this woman - Edith Lake Wilkinson - existed. Instead it uses this lost woman's life to construct an essentially political narrative of oppression and rediscovery, bolstered - due to lack of actual evidence - on the testimony of a psychic. It puts sexual preference, which no longer matters and never should have mattered, ahead of art which has always mattered.

Is this how Edith Lake Wilkinson would wish to be remembered? None of us knows. The dead are....dead. We cannot talk with them. One of the very few ways we can glimpse human consciousness beyond death is art. Animals leave behind, at best, remnants of their bodies. Humans can leave behind things they have created. Nobody can speak for this deceased woman the way her art can. Let her speak. Nobody can presume to speak for her as her art can.",1484438400,5,1145,4.580487804878048
8751887,5,B01BX58AKC,"This was a riveting story.  Our last name is Wilkinson and we also have artists in the family, wondered if we are related the reason that I purchased this.",1478908800,,155,4.344827586206897
