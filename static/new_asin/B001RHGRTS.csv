3776003,5,B001RHGRTS,"It has been worth the wait. A few years ago when Seasons 3-5 came out on DVD, I snapped them up immediately. I loved this show when it was originally on air in the 90's, especially the first season. The quality declined a little every year, and like a snowball rolling down hill got progressively harder to watch until Season 5 crashed and buried itself in an avalanche. Seasons 1 and 2 were held up in a rights dispute, which is now apparently resolved, and not a moment too soon! Season 1 is here and we can only hope that Season 2 is right around the corner.

Technically there is nothing fancy here. Five discs, with commentaries on some of the episodes, it looks good and sounds fine on my DVD player. Not as sturdy packaging as the older DVD sets, but pretty standard nowadays.

What you get is one of the best independent scifi shows of the last 20 years. Its smart, well written and well acted. The story arc unfolds deliberately, with little tidbits of information bearing on the central theme- what are the Taelons doing on Earth?- thrown out in each episode. But there are a few plot twists, and sometimes one piece of information given in an earlier episode is changed or taken back in a later one. The viewer is constantly trying to shift their focus like a kaleidescope, linking story threads, ideas and concepts, trying to see the hidden pattern. My wife, who had never seen the show before, was hooked immediately, and I am excited again, noticing subtle nuances that I had forgotten. She is already bemoaning the fact that we have to wait for Season 2.

The one thing that has really struck me watching the first season is how much of Season 3 really does build off the original premises of the series. After Season 1, the show was radicaly changed; new and changed characters and a simpler story line with more emphasis on action. Surprisingly, since I didn't really remember all the events and details of the first season, some things that are touched on in Season 1 come back in the later seasons, providing more continuity than I was aware off. I am looking forward to rewatching the later Seasons, as much for what the producers did right as what they did wrong.

In the meantime, I am going to fire up the DVD player, sit back and wonder why I cant have a CVI and a skrill.",1242172800,3,2296,4.47255369928401
3776004,5,B001RHGRTS,"From my viewpoint, this series is second only to Babylon Five in being the best sci-fi series made.  Now I'll be holding my breath till they release Season 2, since I've owned the last three seasons for several years.",1241740800,,217,4.564102564102564
3776005,4,B001RHGRTS,"As with many other fans, I have the ADV release of seasons 3,4 & 5.  I was disappointed that after the dust settled with who really owned the rights to season 1 & 2, the winner released season 1 in full screen and only stereo.  The 3 seasons from ADV are in widescreen and dolby 5.1.  The resolution on the ADV seasons also look cleaner.  I wonder how long we'll have to wait for season 2 to complete our sets.",1241654400,28,410,4.0875
3776006,5,B001RHGRTS,"The first season offered Babylon 5 storytelling quality. Rich characters, even characters who you think of in terms of good/bad, black/white, will throw you for a curve. The main character, Boone, begins his journey into the Taelon mystery with a clear delineation of the Taelons as ""bad guys"" only to discover that Taelon/human relations are much more ""shades of grey"" filled with individual (human and Taelon) agendas.

All of which is tossed out beginning season two for a straight forward good human, bad Taelon, let the fighting begin and ""oh yeah can the women of the show wear tighter sweaters and shirts?"" Welcome to late 90s syndication sci-fi/fantasy storytelling. Keep it simple, keep it sexy.

Rather than ranting on; I'll merely offer you a single season one episode, ""Sandoval's Run"". Watch that Sandoval character in that episode versus the schemer and megalomaniac they turn him into in the later seasons. Season one Sandoval is a much more interesting character versus the one dimensional ""bad guy"" he turns into.

I remember back in the beginning of the season two days, a bunch of us fan boys and girls threw a fit on the usenet group over the simpler storytelling (dumbed down) the show descended into only to be told by a show rep the the creators were worried the season one storytelling complexities would chase new viewers off in later seasons who didn't follow it from the beginning. Well the new direction chased me off.

If you saw later seasons and didn't like it or thought it just never lived up to its full potential, try season one. I love it so much I bought it...

Earth: The Final Conflict seasons 1 and 2 have been held up in a ""rights"" war. Basically, two studios were fighting over whom owned the rights to the series' first two seasons. Seasons 3 and 4 were not in dispute and therefore no ""conflict"" (forgive the pun,) held up their releases. Finally, it looks like all that legal crap is resolved and Season one is coming.

I was able to watch uninterrupted, and really get into the show. Is it great, well now that depends on your point of view. It originally aired in syndication that should tell you something. But, the originator was great ""Gene Roddenbury"" The first 4 seasons are very good. I can't say great. The 5th season was not so good, but I own just to complete the series. There are some great parts, but not overall. Very good yes. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a very good show. If it were better, I would have given it 5 stars. The premiss is simple these aliens from another galaxy have come offering all kinds of things medicine, peace, etc. They become the center of the show. And, of course there are ulterior motives behind their being here. Hence the final conflict in the title. Should you buy it, yes you should if you are a sci-fi fan, or like Gene's work. Bear in mind there is less action here then star trek, this is more subtle. That is not to say there is no action, there is plenty of action. so, enjoy.

3776148,3,B001RHGRTS,"It could have been a contender, but it ended up being nothing but a bum.

I think reviews in here are overly praising of Season One mainly because of how bad the show became.  Season One had potential.  Much like Babylon 5, the first season seemed to be building the characters and the atmosphere.  Season One wasn't blow your heads off great, but it felt as if it had something to tell down the line.

The characters were interesting, the production pretty good.  There was plenty of intrigue and questioning, you weren't too sure what would happen.  Then they literally kill the series in the Season Finale, they would never recover.

Problem with Season One is that it was exposition, with some suspense.  It never developed into a must see thing.  I gave it a chance, liked it enough (but didn't love it) to try Season 2, but the show devolved as many have said, from a much less impressive Season 2 to downright depressing Seasons 3 and apparently 4, 5.

This show doesn't go anywhere.  You won't get a Firefly feeling after watching the first season of this.  Don't bother with this.  Season One is pretty good, but it leads no where.",1315526400,8,1140,4.551724137931035

3776152,5,B001RHGRTS,"The replacement of the show's star Kevin Kilner; spelled the end of what could have been a great TV show.  Listening to the director's commentary by Rod Roddenberry( son of Gene Roddenberry), I have to say the execs tried to make this another Star Trek.  A show about first contact has been done before, however this one was much different.  The aliens weren't trusting of us. Unlike many a space saga this one was the reverse.  There was a cold war between both planets.

Kevin Kilner gave this show credibility that a young actor/model could not.  If you want to see 22 episodes of what could have been a great saga, this season was the one to purchase. After season 2 the show suffers the reboot syndrome. Each subsequent year the producers and writers attempt to fix Earth:Final Conflict.  Season one was an example of what they did right. If only the powers that be stayed in that direction.",1296777600,,896,4.59748427672956
3776162,4,B001RHGRTS,"To glance at Earth: Final Conflict, you would likely be overcome with the sensation of ""been there, done that"" either through earlier shows Alien Nation or V, all of which sound remarkably similar in their synopsis.  However, the trademarked title card precursor ""Gene Roddenberry's"" is a hint of the supremacy fans of science fiction staples such as Star Trek can expect in E: FC.  And I can report with confidence that the entire first season delivers on that potential with one caveat: The remaining 4 seasons never manage to capture the magic of the first (reviewed here) and, as you will discover below, thanks to some legal snags in securing the DVD rights to the property, maybe this isn't such a bad thing after all.

Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict, developed on notes and story ideas the late Star Trek creator left behind, turns a common premise into a complex, character-driven tale of tensions between a race of highly evolved aliens who have arrived to Earth with intentions of serving mankind with knowledge and technology.
Co-developed and co-produced by Roddenberry's widow, actress Majel Barrett, Earth: Final Conflict aired for 5 seasons between October 6 1997, and May 20 2002.  The story, unlike the rest of Roddenberry's properties, is set on Early in the 21st century when a race of alien beings (the Taelons) arrives on Earth after existing in orbit for several years. In exchange for refuge on our planet, the Taelons offer humanity access to their advanced technology and knowledge base. As a result, concepts such as disease, war, and global pollution are all but eliminated. Despite such seemingly good intent, there are some individuals highly suspect of the Taelons true intentions and hence an underground resistance movement is organized to ""watch the watchers"" as it were.

Perhaps the true brilliance of the show, at least as far as the first-season is concerned, lies in the simple realization that the conflict isn't a black & white/ good versus evil affair but rather an account of two groups of beings each doing what they feel is right in the name of survival.  Developed as a serial, the ongoing story does a spectacular job of keeping the viewer guessing as to which side they should be supporting in the struggle.  Often times I found myself convinced I had things figured out only for a later plot twist to force me into questioning my earlier conclusions.

The first season starts off a little shaky, with episodes that often resemble the formula found in series like X-Files, where a slightly peculiar mystery demands the expertise of double agents (and main characters) William Boone and Lili Marquette to close.  By the last two discs of the first-season, however, the show settles into a very impressive rhythm, arguable the finest of the entire 5-year run, with emphasis on grander schemes and solid scientifically intriguing concepts.

I mentioned before that the first-season is typically regarded as the finest (and some fans go as far as to say the only worth even watching) and the reason for this is actually quite clear: E: FC works on the idea of character-driven drama and behind-the-scenes drama resulted in an unusually high turnover rate among the regular cast, due in part to contractual disagreements between the cast and the producers.

As a result, nearly all the show's major characters were killed off or otherwise removed within a season or two of being introduced. In fact, the only character to appear as a series regular during all five seasons was FBI Agent & Taelon liaison Ron Sandoval (Von Flores).  Additionally directorial duties were often shuffled in subsequent seasons, with each new director brining a distinctive style to the show's look & feel.

So unstable was the formula that the fifth and final season of the show became radical departure from the storyline setup in the previous four seasons; with the Taelons being replaced by a new and more openly hostile alien race! In this case a group of interstellar energy vampires called the Atavus; a move that outraged dedicated fans of the mythos and crushed what desire to stay tuned remained in viewers whose interest was already waning due to the constantly rotating cast.

Now here's where things really get interesting.  Back in 2003 ADV Films released the third, fourth and fifth seasons of Earth: Final Conflict on DVD as these were the only seasons they managed to secure the distribution rights for.

Six years later (May 5, 2009), Universal Studios Home Entertainment finally released Season 1 on DVD for the first time ever.  The box set spans 5 discs and comes in at a runtime of 855 minutes.  Extras are abundant and include cast and crew commentary tracks over several key episodes and a handful of featurettes and retrospectives involving many of the original actors and production members.  Universal Studios also owns the rights to the complete second season of the program but at present, have announced no plans to release a DVD box set domestically.

In conclusion, recommending the complete first season box set of Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict is very easy thanks to solid storytelling, believable drama, interesting concepts, and a very thorough Universal Studios DVD box set treatment (the icing on the cake is the extremely welcoming MRSP of the set: Under $15 brand new at many retailers).  However, the mindset required going in is to literarily convince one's self that this is the only season of the program that ever existed due to the fact that the second season never came to DVD and the out of production (ADV Films' released) third, fourth, and fifth are now nearly-impossible to find.  As a small consolation, fans of the show are adamant about the notion that this was the best season anyway and after completing the box set last night, I must concur with their admiration.",1275523200,22,5862,4.966292134831461
3776163,5,B001RHGRTS,"EFC began as superior adult science fiction with a great story line, excellent screenwriting, great characters with strong acting, and a sense of mystery that few series of any genre have equaled.

The first season follows Roddenberry's original creative line and was kept on track by his widow, Majel Barrett.

Unfortunately, the producers felt that THEY could do better by changing the cerebral first season show to a simple action line in subsequent seasons with attractive, young and one-dimensional characters simplified for the assumed ""stupid"" audience who obviously would have found season one too difficult to comprehend.

If EFC had been allowed to continue on its original story arc with the the original cast and characters, it could have been a strong contender for best SF series ever.

So... enjoy season 1.
Don't waste your time with any other seasons. They drop to idiotic in season 2 episode 1 and proceed rapidly further down into the icy depths of TV hell.",1263513600,6,976,5.043478260869565

This season takes you through the labyrinth of organized sophistication.  The season one is about dispersement of technology; whose got it and who does not!

3776165,5,B001RHGRTS,"SO, I like many others have waited what seems like centuries to get season 1 & 2. I have seasons 3-5 from ADV(yeah I snatched them up as soon as they were released) but I was so desperately looking for season 1 & 2. Now I know why I couldn't find them anywhere. Like many of Gene's works I have always come in on the 4th season so here is a prime example of someone who came in late but understood everything but WHY the tealons/companions came to earth. So I will finally get to see them. Funny I was just saying at the Vegas convention how much I wanted season 1-2 and wow Season 1 is released and Season 2 releasing soon. So excited can't wait to view them.",1252713600,2,660,4.084615384615384
3776166,5,B001RHGRTS,"When it came out originally, I thought that Earth:Final Conflict was some of the best television Sci-Fi ever made.  Now watching the first season again on DVD, I can confidently say that it might have been some of the best television ever made, period.  Comparisons to Babylon 5 are plentiful, and they would be accurate.  E:FC's first season hinted at a very broad, heavy hitting story arc, and the characters were nuances on top of nuances.  During the commentary on one of the early episodes, someone mentions that Kilner is having to play Boone from five different emotional angles in one scene, and they are right--all of the characters have a mix of good, bad, selfish, selfless, etc that never really let you feel who the good guys and the bad guys are.

It's bittersweet, though, because this will be the only season I purchase.  I know there was some decent material in later seasons, but there was nothing of what I loved.  The characters were flattened out (or replaced), and the arc is either forgotten or, when they do decide to move it forward, thrust in our faces.

I like to believe that Earth:Final Conflict never made it past season 1.  Because of that, it was one of the best television shows ever made.",1250812800,8,1222,4.6465116279069765
3776167,5,B001RHGRTS,"If you're curious about this series, but don't have a lot of cash to spend, I recommend limiting yourself to seasons 1 and 4.  Why those?  Well as others have pointed-out very little happens in years two and three, which fell into a kind of Gilligan's Island syndrome.  In every episode the characters discover a way to beat or expose the visiting Aliens as evil, but at the end they fail to achieve their goal, and there's a ""reset"" to return everything back to the status quo.  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  Seasons 2/3 are boring to watch.

But seasons 1 and 4 put in the effort to advance the story.  Season 1 basically asks the questions and sets-up the mystery, while season 4 provides the answers with an ultimate conclusion to the Alien/Human story.

So that's what I have in my collection - 1 and 4.  Taken together they resemble Babylon 5 or Deep Space Nine in complexity.  The other seasons I owned at one point, but I eventually sold them off since they were so inferior.",1248480000,23,978,4.505681818181818
3776168,5,B001RHGRTS,"It was nice to finally have season 1 of Earth Final Conflict available on DVD.  In my oppinion it is the best non Star Trek Gene Roddenberry created series.  I have had season 3 and 4 for years but unless you have season 1 and 2 you're at a lost.  It has a story ark that begins in season 1 and plays into season 2,3,4,5.

I don't know whether the word is cheesy or campy to describe this Season One or EFC.  at any rate, I adore Gene  Roddenberry and respect what he was doing in the script.

The writing on this season and the next were the best of the five. BUT, I own 3, 4, & 5 already and have repeatedly watched and remembered my first impressions. The price is extremely reasonable.

the cool thing was is that After pre-ordering it for free via A gift card waiting another 2 month I finally received it on the Same Day as the New Star Trek Movie came out. Now how is that for timing. As you can see, Season 3,4, and 5 have been out for a whole and Is getting harder come by,So here is your chance to get clout up with this Awesome! Series. Season One was every thing I remembered it. This is because of the licensing in that Season 1 and 2 are owned by universal and 3,4, and 5 are owned by ADV films.

Looking at the later seasons I sometimes wander why they killed of the original main actor ""BOONE"". All there is lift now is For Season 2 to come out. I will be just a eager to fill that big gape. This Series was A head if its time filled with great story are, lots of action and over flowing plots. A great show as all Gene's creations are.

Once again Gene dives into the posabilities that humanity has so much to offer and needs to be open minded enough to admit we also have so much to learn. The yin-and-yang that is humanity and how dealing with another spiecies could bring out both the best and worst in us.
Thought provoking, involving Sci-Fi, that doesn't dumb things down but helps raise our minds to a new understanding of not only what posability lies in our future, but also the posabilities that lay within each of us.

The mystery of the ture motivations of the friendly alien visitors known as the Companions/Taelons remain engaging throughout the five year series.  For the first time, the original first and second seasons are becoming available to american audiences.  The EFC second season has already been released in PAL format.  We will see the second season in the US.  For those who love intelligent science fiction, Earth the Final Conflict (EFC) will meet those needs.  Every episode builds on the last.  Each episode is an individual story, but reveals portions of the five year story arc.  The fifth season is the final revalation and unveils the secret of the Taelon/Jaridian war.
