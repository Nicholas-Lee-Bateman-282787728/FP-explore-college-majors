365597,4,6301750721,"This review  is for the Blu-Ray release of 'The Monster of Piedras Blancas' released by Olive Films in July, 2016.

Up until this release....this movie was very difficult to find but you could find it if you were willing to purchase a bootleg. I was looking forward to this release because I had only previously viewed this movie from a poor bootleg copy. I was not disappointed.

My rating for this movie is based on the print quality and the movie itself taking into account the time period and the budget.

BLU-RAY: The transfer is very good though not perfect. The picture had a slightly grainy look throughout. There are occasional imperfections...mostly tiny static like spots that appear throughout also. But overall it's nice to have such a nice print available for such an obscure 'B' science fiction movie from the 50's. There is, however, a downside to such a nice print. When the picture is this clear on old science fiction movies, all the imperfections come out. For example, the monster suit looks slightly less realistic. In one scene in particular, the scene where a crab is picking at a severed head, a string is very obviously attached to the crab. This was for the purpose of moving the crab sharply after it is shot. Overall, I am quite happy with the picture.

EXTRA'S: Almost nothing here. You get subtitles, if you count that as an extra, and that is it.
If this release had had some decent extra's, a commentary track, making of documentary, etc. I would have given it 5 stars.

PLOT/SUMMARY: The movie opens with a scene of a monstrous hand getting some food from what appears to be a dog dish. The dish is lying amongst rocks on a rocky beach. This is followed by a scene in which a lighthouse keeper is yelling at two boys to stay away. Then we get the opening credits. The next morning the Rinaldi brothers are found dead and decapitated with all the blood drained from them on the beach. The bodies are brought to the Kolchek's store to be put in his refrigeration room till the bodies can be examined. Kolchek is a superstitious sort and warns all the townpeople of the 'monster of Piedras Blancas' that is supposed to live near the lighthouse. The townspeople seem to think the lighthouse keeper knows something but is keeping to himself. The lighthouse keeper's daughter, Lucy,  is dating Fred, a marine biologist who lives in town. The lighthouse keeper gets into a spat with Kolchek about meat scraps. Kolchek is supposed to save them for the lighthouse keeper's dog but he has sold them to someone else. The lighthouse keeper gives Kolchek a warning and tells him he will be responsible. That evening the monster visits Kolchek's in search for food and kills Kolchek. The next day during the funeral for the Rinaldi brother's, Jimmy, a little boy discovers Kolchek's body. At the scene, what appears to be a scale is found. Fred and Doc come to the conclusion that it comes from some sort of undersea life. Eddie a local, is put in charge of watching Kolchek's store. Shortly thereafter, a little girl is found murdered by her father. The body is brought to the local diner and the constable and Doc go looking for Eddie when nobody can seem to find him. The constable enters the refrigerator and a scream is heard. Everybody approaches the refrigerator and the monster comes out holding Eddie's head. He is struck with a cleaver by a local before the local is knocked out. Another scale is found on the axe. The townspeople get together and hunt for the monster. Another man is killed on the beach and another badly injured.
Meanwhile, the lighthouse keeper is recovering from his injuries after he was knocked unconscious the night his daughter went for a swim. After she tells him she feels like she was being watched he goes out to take a look. He insists on getting out of bed to tend to the lighthouse. He is afraid of what might happen if he doesn't turn the light on. He's afraid somebody will crash into the rocks and get killed by the monster. Lucy, doesn't want him to go so he is forced to reveal what he knows. He tells her that for many years he has been leaving food for the monster but he has never seen it. He just knows that it is living in the caves by the lighthouse.
The bottom line here is that the monster is now killing people because he was hunting for food after the lighthouse keeper failed to leave the meat scraps a few evenings earlier.
Ultimately this all leads us to a showdown between the lighthouse keeper, Lucy, Fred and the townspeople at the lighthouse.

PRODUCTION: According to 'Keep Watching the Skies' by Bill Warren, the movie was not shot at Piedras Blancas but was shot at Point Conception.

The movie stars veteran movie actor Les Tremayne as Dr. Sam Jorgenson and Forrest Lewis as Constable George Matson, Don Sullivan as Fred, John Harmon as Sturges, the lighthouse keeper and Jeanne Carmen as Lucille Sturges.

There were a few seconds of stock footage used for whatever reason. This occurs when Fred and the constable leave the cave when they here some commotion coming from the beach. The film is of very poor quality and they are wearing different outfits and they both have hats. Why this was deemed necessary for just two seconds is anybodies guess.

THOUGHTS/CONCLUSIONS: The scene where the monster walks out of the refrigerated room with Eddie's head must have been startling in it's day. I doubt very many people had seen such a thing  in 1959. Despite some criticism that the head looked fake, I thought it was pretty decent and actually looked very much like Eddie.

Another surprising scene for the time involved Lucy walking out of the ocean in the nude. Although you couldn't see her private parts due to dark shadows covering her front. Later on there is a scene of her undressing and she is wearing just a skimpy bra. Once again, for the times, this must have been surprising.

The idea for this movie very obviously sprung from 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon.' I hate calling movies a 'rip-off' of another picture but that's what it basically is. I'd rather say it was 'inspired by.'

I felt the acting was decent for a very low budget movie. The male lead, Don Sullivan, plays the lead in another 'cult' 50's science fiction movie, 'The Giant Gila Monster.'

I felt that it was a good idea to not show the monster for most of the movie. Even though this sort of thing was often done to hide a poor costume, it is still effective. The costume was decent but the actor wearing it seemed to have a very tough time moving around in it. It was obvious that he was struggling to move and it was a good idea to have the monster shot a few times which could partially explain his inability to move on the stairs and try to knock the door down (which he manages to do anyway with very little effort!)

There weren't that many obvious plot holes or gaps of logic as there are normally in a movie of this type. One is when the light house keeper, after being knocked unconscious by the monster, states that perhaps the rumors are true of a monster. He obviously knows that it is true as he has been feeding the monster for many years, including in the opening scene! He then remains quiet even after bodies start regularly showing up.

I felt that finding the second scale was basically useless. Maybe there was a rewrite somewhere along the line. Afterall, the found the second scale after everybody had already seen the monster. It's not as if they didn't have the murder mystery solved at that point.

Does the monster actually die at the end. He is thrown off the lighthouse top but lands in the water. He is, we are told, an amphibious creature. The assumption is supposed to be that he dies but logically he may not have. I suppose this could have led to a sequel?

CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS:  I give this movie a slightly generous 4 1/2 stars because there was basically nothing available before. I'm giving the plot 3 stars. However, it gets only 1/2 star for the extra's (subtitles). Overall I give it 4 stars. OK...I know it should probably only be 3 stars but I'm giving it an extra star just because I want to.

Recommended for anybody who is a collector of 1950's science fiction movies. Recommended for anybody who likes the movie because it is easily the best version available.

Thanks to Olive Films for releasing this movie on Blu-Ray.",1490486400,,8351,4.5824396782841825
365598,4,6301750721,"My rating is based on my overall 'viewing experience.' That includes the first time I'd seen this film - about the mid-60s, on television - as a kid. There was one particular (infamous) scene which literally gave me nightmares for a couple of days.
As for the film itself, it's a standard 1950's monster film - essentially a ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"" wanna-be. The notable thing about this film was it's (for the time) *excessive* gore (though today that would basically be called a ""jump scare"").
The quality of this DVD version is very good. I've seen some of the, uh, 'sketchier' versions - most of them being extremely dark. However the clarity of this version is extremely good.
Bottom line:
Is this a great film? No. But if you're a fan of the cheesy monster flicks from that era, I'd say this is a must have. I will say that the price (I paid about $12) is a little high, but if you really want a copy of this, that price seems like a bargain.",1488672000,,961,4.404494382022472

My old, worn,VHS-quality dupe is shamed---and thrown in a fire--- after T=H=I=S resolution-upgrade.
The aspect ration has been REFORMATTED to fit modern TV screen, so there's, obvious, information
that's missing from the top and bottom of a few scenes. I prefer to do my OWN cropping, so THAT'd be
MY only complaint. Some scenes are, purposely [atmospheric] grainy. The source-material is adequate.
This is more of an, adult, ""Creature From the BLEAK Lagoon"" film than a standard '50s Saturday Matinee.

365770,5,6301750721,"This is my review of the new Blu-ray edition by Olive Films.
MOPB is one of my all-time favorite low budget creature films of the 1950's, and I am so happy someone finally took
the trouble to transfer a beautiful print to Blu-ray. The PQ is outstanding, I can see details I never knew existed.
Dark and washed out scenes that were on the bootleg DVD and the VHS are Crystal clear here, and I can finally
get a really good look at the rubber monster suit. There is also a bit more film footage in this disk, the beginning of
the film is complete. It looks like they found a pristine print and used it to transfer.
The aspect ration has been modified to fit modern wide screen TV's, so there is noticeable top and bottom frame
cropping in a few scenes, but I approve of their decision to do it this way.
I can even see the grain in a few scenes that where they were apparently pushing the camera aperture to compensate
for low light. The print used here is very clean, no pop's, frame drop-outs, scratches, etc.
I see very little digital enhancement noise, and there are a few scenes that look grainy because it was shot that way.
I had given up hope that anyone would do this obscure film justice on Blu-ray, but Olive Films stepped up to the plate.
If you are a fan of this film, or love old low budget creature movies, you need to have this disk.

365801,5,6301750721,"BOTTOM LINE: This is a fun little chiller that fully delivers the promised goods - unlike many other flicks of its type - and at 71 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's got a creepy-cool monster, nice location photography and some surprisingly decent thrills & shocks for an older film. If you enjoy old school man-in-suit beasties then you're gonna love THE MONSTER OF PIEDRAS BLANCAS. 5 STARS!

THE STORY: There is a legend whispered among citizens of the quaint coastal village of Piedras Blancas. A strange and terrible creature is said to lurk in the dangerous surf and stalk the lonely cliff-side caverns far below the remote lighthouse on the edge of town. Just a silly old wives' tale and nothing more, right? Then one evening a couple of local fishermen wash ashore - drained of blood, their heads torn off and their bodies clawed to pieces. The tiny hamlet is rocked by waves of shock, fear & disbelief. The horrific murders seem too ghastly to have been perpetrated by a man, even a crazy one. Could there be more to those gruesome campfire stories than anyone ever dared to believe??? As the body count continues to rise, it's up to the cantankerous constable, a disbelieving local doctor and an eager young marine biologist to get to the bottom of the grisly goings-on before it's too late. Maybe they should talk to the reclusive old hermit who's worked for years as caretaker of the remote lighthouse out on the cliffs. Surely he must have seen or heard something... living by himself way out there.

THOUGHTS (contains spoilers): A terrific little independent shocker from 1959 with enough atmosphere and a few surprising visual jolts of its own to set it apart from, and in some ways above, its scaly brethren. The film features stalwart character actors Les Tremayne and Don Sullivan, both of whom turn in solid, sincere performances, even when dealing with absurdly silly dialogue and less than competent co-stars. While many other creature films were studio-bound product, TMoPBs independent production gave it its own unique flavor. The film is shot almost entirely in & around Point Conception, California, adding tremendously to the feel of haunting loneliness and the cozy small town look of the picture. The production suffers the usual low budget woes common with such fare but the film is peppered with some delightfully quirky characters, like the town grocer with a taste for the macabre, the cranky lighthouse keeper, and Timmy (perhaps the world's fastest sprinter with a leg brace since Forrest Gump); these plus a grotesque, well-executed monster help make this movie one to remember. The creature suit is an amalgamation: equal parts original design & confiscation, (including the feet from the ""Metaluna Mutant"" from THIS ISLAND EARTH & the claws from one of THE MOLE PEOPLE). The end result makes for a truly disturbing, properly menacing aquamaniac. While the producers wisely keep him in the shadows early on, they aren't afraid to show The Monster in all his slimy, drooling, reptilian glory during the final reel.

This independent film from VanWick Productions also dared to push the envelope a tad. In one scene early in the film, the lighthouse keeper's daughter & her boyfriend picnic on a secluded section of the beach and eventually make (off screen) love; her ample curves strategically concealed by a rumpled blanket as she naps in the afterglow. Later that evening she goes for a solo moonlight skinny-dip, and although obscured from the shoulders down we watch her undress completely, culminating with her casually tossing her panties up on the rocks. Pretty risque' stuff for 50's-era kiddie matinee fodder. But the penultimate sequence, one which both hardcore & casual fans remember most, is the garish scene where the monster is interrupted while snaking in a local grocery store meat locker. When surprised by the sheriff it knocks him out of the way and lumbers out of the ice box door towards the camera... with the bloody severed head of its most recent victim clutched in its long-taloned claw! These scenes helped differentiate TMoPB from other monster fare that filled theaters & drive-ins of the 1950's. The erotic titillation & genuine shocks - while decidedly tame by modern standards - most likely had many young moviegoers back in the day sniggering amongst their buddies one minute, then jumping & screaming in their seats the next.

THE BLU-RAY: Looking far better than it ever has in previous Public Domain releases, THE MONSTER OF PIEDRAS BLANCAS can finally be appreciated in all its beautiful black & white glory. No more murky, blobby shots or blurry out-of-focus scenes; you can clearly read all the street & building signage now, and even the product labels on the food items in Kochek's grocery store! The techs at Olive Films have done an admirable job here. This Blu-ray transfer (from a presumably high quality source print) shows no noticeable signs of dirt, debris, film scratches or damage, nor any annoying pixelation/artifacting, and only the slightest hint of crush (video noise) in some darker scenes. Honestly, TMoPB really looks wonderful here on this hi-def release. Sound is strong although at times the dialogue is slightly overpowered by the musical score & sound effects, but at least there are no obnoxious pops, hissing or jumpy projector stumbling. An English subtitle option is thoughtfully provided for the hearing impaired. Sadly however there are ZERO extras; not even a copy of the theatrical trailer.

The biggest gripe with this release is the film's presented aspect ratio. Movie purists should be aware that the film has been re-framed to fill widescreen TV's, with a 1.78:1 ratio. Those who've never seen it before will probably not even notice, but I've watched this old flick several times over the years and there are certain scenes where I could easily tell that cropping had occurred. Does this make the film unwatchable? Of course not, but it dredges up all the headaches we moviephiles went through years ago, before widescreen TV's became the norm, when movie prints that were originally in widescreen had their sides cropped into a 4:3 shape, for then-normal television viewing. Now it's going in the other direction and I personally find it as deplorable as ""pan & scan"" cropping was back in the day. Just leave the films the way they were originally presented! Other than that, I have no complaints about this Olive Films release of THE MONSTER OF PIEDRAS BLANCAS. It's one of my all-time favorite 1950's-era monster movies and it's wonderful to finally see it all cleaned up and looking so nice.",1468281600,,6622,4.989140271493213

365803,5,6301750721,"It's one of those films that must have distracted America from the threat of space monsters, atomic monsters, and old monsters.  And it was filmed in Cayucos, where I grew up, and I remember the town and the coast just the way it's filmed. Morro Rock, Pelican Rock, and Whale Rock plus the pier-which is still there...worth watching and inviting the gang over for the viewing. It does need to be on DVD!",1354060800,,403,4.52054794520548
365804,4,6301750721,"I saw this movie on late night TV way back in 1962 (I was six) up in Saratoga Springs, NY on what was called The ""Weirdo Late Show"" (WTEN channel 10). Several scenes stuck in my head for years until I finally got to see it again. I thought I'd be disappointed, but no! It actually still had an impact, and it does have a couple of rather gruesome scenes for the 1950's.

The monster is shown a little at a time and the film is just moody enough to make it work. The beach scenes also look properly eerie. The on location lighthouse scenes are similarly interesting, although it's the ""Point Conception"" lighthouse and not the real ""Piedras Blancas"" lighthouse (probably because the ""Point Conception"" lighthouse had a more unusual look).

Some of the acting is a bit off but the characters (especially the lighthouse keeper and the store owner) are fun to watch, not to mention the always reliable Les Tremayne.

Obviously influenced by ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", overall this is entertaining for those who like a good monster flick. I have an old copy and will certainly get this if it shows up on DVD and/or Blu-ray.

UPDATE (9/14/16): Just received my copy of the Blu Ray release. Watched it and it looks great. Very crisp and generally with natural film-grain. On thing I noticed was how much easier to read all those signs and product packaging on Kocheck's store. The Blu ray is in 1:1.78 although it looks more like 1:1.85 on my set. At any rare, I'm not sure if this movie was originally done on matted widescreen AR but it looks pretty natural.

Unfortunately, there's no extras. (There is an English subtitles option).

As a video presentation, I doubt if the movie could look better. If you're a fan, this Blu ray is well worth adding to your collection.",1339891200,,1772,4.591772151898734
365805,5,6301750721,Last time I saw this flick was 55years ago. In the Savoy Movie Theater we called the  DUMPS  off 187st Bronx N.Y.. It sacred the heck outta me back then. Was nice to see it was released on VHS tape. Wish it was DVD. But I still enjoyed watching the Movie after all these years. Ah the good old days.,1316736000,,299,3.966666666666667
365806,5,6301750721,"THE MONSTER OF PIEDRAS BLANCAS is one of those 50s monster movies I remember seeing over a million years ago. I just watched the video version again 5 minutes ago, and man oh man, this one deserves a DVD release (or download, or something, anything)! Where is this classic? I mean, with all of the ultra-cheeeze out there, you'd think that this one would be a no-brainer! Anyway, TMOPB has both Les Tremayne (WAR OF THE WORLDS, THE MONOLITH MONSTERS, ANGRY RED PLANET) and Don ""banjo-lele"" Sullivan (THE GIANT GILA MONSTER, TEENAGE ZOMBIES)! It also has one of the better sea monsters ever to swim out of hollywood! This critter even has a penchant for decapitating its victims! So, if you want head-cheeeze, you can't go wrong w/ this baby! The finale in the lighthouse is a classic monster movie moment, and simply must have influenced a young John Carpenter! His lighthouse scene in THE FOG is reminiscent of this one, especially atmospherically. Great stuff!...",1278288000,,965,4.8545454545454545

Nice clear and not grainy picture. I'm not sure if there are extra's on the disc but for ten bucks it,s a winner. Thanks to Olive Films for not colorizing it like some people want. It would ruin the film doing that. I have always liked the movie and I'm very happy there is a factory copy finally to add to my collection.",1243209600,,495,4.11340206185567
365808,4,6301750721,"This is a good 1950's era monster movie. Like others have said, it does drag in a few places. It's from Republic Pictures, which you don't see many horror films from this company, usually war or westerns with John Wayne and such. It does have a scary breathing and loud heart beat when ever the monster is around. This film for me, was a lesser known of the genre so it intrigued me to get it. Good to get for the collection.

7815391,5,6301750721,"Not bad low-budget late 50's so-bad-it's-good horror flick.  A surly, anti-social lighthouse keeper keeps a mysterious creature (that he never sees) fed and cared for.  When he can't feed it mayhem ensues and townspeople start dying violently.  When the monster finally makes an appearance, WOW!  It's just a man in a monster suit but the face is UGLY.  Filmed on location in a seaside town it is at least atmospheric.  The town is so small that even though it has a church it doesn't seem to have a pastor.  At the gravesite ceremony the town doctor is reading from the scriptures.  The DVD is excellent quality.  The Olive Films DVD is beautifully restored, but it has absolutely no extras.  Not even the trailer.  Other than that highly recommended.",1512864000,,752,4.796875

Total B 50's horror at it's best. The plastic monster costume, the local actors and the terrible acting. So bad it's Great.
