8170586,1,B000MQ4WLK,"I was led to ""Mama's Foot"" by an episode of Good Mythical Morning that discussed movie poster art and outrageous plots. The film had such an unusual plot I had to see it. This is an extremely low budget comedy about two loser twin brothers Gary and Cary (TaettaChip and Tyrell Banks) from South Central LA who have to raise $1,000 in two days or their mama's diseased foot will have to be amputated. (So surgery is cheaper?) That's pretty much the whole movie. There are many scenes that are supposed to be funny, but most of them fall flat. The entire production is very amateurish, and while some might find humor in some of the jokes, most depend on extreme stereotyping, and it largely doesn't work (though the scene where the sons have to decide who's going to rub Mama's foot is a highlight).

One of the reasons the film fails is because it's totally unfocused and careens wildly from one subplot to another. To raise the money the boys first decide to fraudulently use Cary's girlfriend Darkeisha's (Racquia West) EBT card to buy chili ingredients, but after half an hour of that the boys are denied entrance to the contest and that subplot fizzles entirely. There's then an insurance fraud subplot where an automobile accident is alleged to have rendered one of the boys unable ""to poop straight"". This almost works but fraudsters can get defrauded too as it turns out, sending the plot back to square one. After an obligatory basketball game without a contextual reason to exist (ditto the twerking contest rehearsal and the random drunk lunatic in the Army shirt), the whole cast shows up for an epic rap battle to win $1,000. I won't tell you who wins the rap battle (and 30-album recording contract!), but you will be unsurprised to learn that Mama retains all of her appendages intact (and gets a new boyfriend in the deal).

The film has an absolutely terrible ending, though a chili cookoff rap over the closing credits is unique. After seeing this movie I never again need to hear anyone pointlessly roll their R's, nor do I need to hear the word ""Cuz"" ever again. I like independent films from lesser-known filmmakers, and I want them to succeed in all genres and facets of the medium, but ""Mama's Foot"" is a trying experience to sit through. It's about 80 minutes long, which is much too much. If they had made this as a short film with more focus, and edited a lot of the extraneous stuff out it would have worked much better. As it is the most entertaining part of the movie for me was the outtakes over the closing credits which are in many cases funnier than the finished scenes in the film.",1471392000,,2614,4.583333333333333

8170588,5,B000MQ4WLK,"Mama's Foot is, quite simply, the most important, albeit tragically unheralded cinematic masterpiece of our time. The film masquerades as just another low budget ghetto farce, but this reviewer wasn't fooled for one minute; Mama's Foot is actually a thought-provoking and scathing look at America's healthcare crisis and how that crisis adds to the tragic plight of the elderly. The Soderbergh-like cinematography and acting style combined with the stark locations and spot on dialog make for an entertaining yet eerily troubling 80 minute experience like no other. Do whatever it takes to watch this under-appreciated gem. Now that's it's no longer available for streaming, your best option is this DVD, but I, along with the rest of the film world cognoscenti are eagerly awaiting the Blu-ray and UHD versions with baited breath.",1456876800,2,831,5.303030303030303
