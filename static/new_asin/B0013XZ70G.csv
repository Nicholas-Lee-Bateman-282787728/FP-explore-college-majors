3120978,5,B0013XZ70G,"Mill Creek Entertainment has done it again!

While some may consider the inclusion of movie serials to be a bit of a cheat on this set, one can argue that movie serials (and radio) served as a starting point of sorts for the early years of episodic television and, of course, the serials did eventually make their way to television's airwaves.  Perhaps the only major omission of a show with a paranormal flavor that is in the public domain and is not included in this set is Boris Karloff's limited series ""The Veil"" which, possibly, could have substituted for one of the serials.  Regardless, this 12-DVD set includes a mixture of some very common, some not so common, and some downright rare shows.  Arguably, the biggest ""find"" on this set is the inclusion of 24 episodes of ""Captain Z-Ro"" and, to the best of my knowledge, this set marks the commercial DVD debut of Boris Karloff's ""Thriller,"" a series that many fans have long desired to see on DVD.  Perhaps the inclusion of the ""Thriller"" episode ""The Return of Andrew Bentley"" might prompt further consideration for an official DVD release of this series in the future.  And those who previously purchased Mill Creek's 4-DVD set of 50 ""One Step Beyond"" episodes will be delighted to know that of the 16 episodes included here, only one episode (""Where Are They?"") is repeated from that earlier box set.

Among the unsold pilots, I enjoyed the second incarnation of ""The Shadow"" titled ""Invisible Avenger,"" which was filmed on location in New Orleans in the late 1950s and was eventually released theatrically, and ""Tales of Frankenstein.""  Don Megowan, who appears as the monster in ""Frankenstein"" also appears in the live action version of ""Captain Fathom,"" which plays like a low rent version of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.""  One also wonders about the possibilities of ""Destination Space"" had it been picked up as a regular series by CBS.  Though a bit on the talky side (especially in the middle scenes depicted on earth), the pilot featured solid performances from TV veterans like Harry Townes, Charles Aidman, Edward Platt, Whitney Blake and Gail Kobe, and had the backing of a major studio, Paramount.

As is the case with compilations of public domain shows, the audio/visual quality is all over the map and reflects a variety of sources such as kinescopes for the live shows and unrestored 16 millimeter syndication prints for many of the TV show episodes.  While none of the episodes that I have viewed so far are unwatchable, this is definitely not a set for videophiles, nor those expecting state-of-the-art special effects.  In fact, the special effects are downright primitive when compared to today's special effects and CGI.  But considering the low budgets for most of these productions, it's obvious that the SFX people were trying to do the best they could with the limited resources available to them and that's part of the charm of watching these early Sci-Fi TV efforts.

The variety of the shows included in this set is so broad that there is bound to be something to appeal to almost anyone who even remotely enjoys science fiction.  This set  is highly recommended for classic/vintage TV fans and those who enjoy the early days of science fiction on the small screen.  My rating is closer to **** &  for this release, just missing a full five stars given the variable audio/visual quality.",1239667200,159,4592,4.867609254498714
3120979,5,B0013XZ70G,"I run the Sci-Fi Lists website and I have to say I am more than happy with this outstanding collection of public domain TV episodes and cinematic serials. Despite what one other reviewer said, some of this stuff is extremely hard to find anywhere else... especially the 24 time-tripping episodes of Captain Z-Ro. When you add in the TV version of Flash Gordon (14eps) and the well-produced Rocky Jones (23eps) there is no escaping the fact that this set is value for money.

Criticism of the inclusion of cinematic serials is also unfair. They were repeated mercilessly during the early days of TV, with the good quality transfers of the Commando Cody adventure Radar Men From the Moon being the pick of the bunch. For sheer low-budget joy check out failed pilot Here Comes Tobor and the three nifty 'Synchro-Vox' Cambia animated series. The episodes of the various TV anthology series are also generally very well selected on the basis of their sci-fi content. No Captain Video, Tom Corbett or Space Patrol--but the cosmically canny sci-fi artefacts on offer are out of this world!",1237852800,66,1082,4.880434782608695
3120980,4,B0013XZ70G,"Any reviewer stating that this collection is a rip-off couldn't be more wrong in my opinion.  Mill Creek is a wonderful company that is one of the first distributors to provide public domain material at a budget, affordable price.  Their price structure is the same for all their 150 episode box sets. If you can wait a little while you will be able to pick this up for around $16 or less.  I couldn't recommend their other TV classics enough.  Their 3 Western and Detective releases are wonderful, and should be sought-out.  I have been asking Mill Creek to release a Sci-fi set this past year and they are now doing it and I couldn't be happier.  Since they are releasing public domain material, they have to stick with what they have available. I'm sure they are putting the serials on the set to not only fill space, but they must have thought they would fit in nicely with the Sci-fi theme.  I can't wait to watch some of these old episodes again.  Looks like good family fun.",1229558400,46,981,4.47191011235955
3120981,2,B0013XZ70G,"Now, it's true, there are a few programs here that might be worth viewing, but there are two serials stuck in the collection that can be downloaded from public dormain websites; Radar men from the Moon and the Phantom Empire.  The price might be too high for this collection even if the majority of programs are basically pilot programs (ie The Shadow).  If the price was lower minus the serials it might be worth looking into.
However, for my money, I won't buy it.",1229472000,6,466,4.535714285714286
3120982,4,B0013XZ70G,Good collection of T.V. stuff. Some not so great but the Tobor is worth it.,1226534400,,75,4.066666666666666
3120983,5,B0013XZ70G,"Absolutely love this set. If you've ever bought any of Millcreek's stuff before, then you know what you're getting. Some gems, some obscure stuff and some that's just notable for it's historical value. And all of it is always entertaining. Quality of the prints if passable, and for the price you can't really complain. You're getting 150 episodes of old sci-fi goodness, sure to keep you entertained for hours to come.",1474070400,,419,4.915492957746479

3120986,5,B0013XZ70G,"Among other things, this has the best print of The Phantom Empire that I've seen. All of the serials in this set look good, plus there are cool old shows like Captain Z-Ro that I didn't know existed! I have watched several episodes of all of the shows, and spot checked the serials (which I've seen before.) While you're not going to get restored prints, everything looks at least decent.

3121035,4,B0013XZ70G,"Mostly low-budget and cheesy, but fun, sci-fi TV programming from the 1950s and 1960s. CAPTAIN Z-RO is a pretty intelligent and educational show that must have been fun for kids back in the day. ONE STEP BEYOND was a Twilight Zone-style show supposedly based on true stories. CLUTCH CARGO, SPACE ANGEL and CAPTAIN FATHOM were examples of ""limited animation,"" a cost-saving method popular in the early 1960s.

A few serials from the 1930s are included, probably because they were shown on TV during the early years: the amazing UNDERSEA KINGDOM, and PHANTOM EMPIRE (gloriously silly - is it a western or a crime thriller or sci-fi?) RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON is a spirited Fifties copy of those campy serials.",1406592000,2,706,4.883333333333334

3121040,2,B0013XZ70G,"I took a chance on this one for $10 with Prime, and it's generally pretty lame. I was hoping for some Ed Woodesque ""so bad its amusing anyway"" type of entertainment and it's just mostly bad in a boring, irritating way. Captain Z-RO makes an attempt to be educational to the little children, but boring conversations in a ""space ship"" are still boring conversations and the kid is a terrible actor and rather odd-looking to boot so I can't even begin to explain that. The TV ""Flash Gordon"" is better but not by much. I will say that the ""Space Angel"" episodes are the best of the lot; I didn't care for it when I was a kid in the 60s but watching it from an adult's eyes I have to say its kinda trippy...LOL...And ""One Step Beyond"" has a couple nice episodes.

The Phantom Empire--has a young Gene Autry and started the whole singing cowboy thing i think.  also has Wheeler Oakman, and Warner Richmond who are seen in the Lost Jungle with Clyde Beatty, the famous lion tamer.  that one was good for its day if you are forgiving.  Wheeler was also in Darkest Africa which was the second Beatty serial.  Which, If you find you like The Phantom Empire you might like Darkest Africa which has a storyline i found to be one of the fun ones.  i am on the forgiving side but it was a decent adventure/jungle serial for its day.

Radar Men from the Moon--invaders from the moon.  good to see the moon men keep up with mars here.  can't not enjoy an invasion.  clayton moore (the Lone Ranger) is a henchman in this.  roy barcroft is retik the leader of the moon's invasion.  if you like this rocketman concept after watching this, you will want to know that there are three other serials with a rocketman.
those are all cliffhanger movie serials with several episodes not tv but good sci fi stuff if you like old sci fi.

Rocky Jones, Space Ranger--good if you like old sci fi and like it not so dark but more lighthearted and nonviolent.  i'm comparing it to the Tom Corbett, Space Cadet and Space Patrol i've seen on DVD with the quality rating of this comment.

Tales of Tomorrow--sci fi for those of us who have seen every twilight zone episode and are forgiving.  it's a little bit like a very early tv twilight zone.

Captain Z-Ro--educational sci fi.  if you're forgiving you can get into the concept.  you travel back in time and see historical figures in the majority of these.
and there is one great episode of General Electric Theater with Ronald Reagan and Cloris Leachman.  a little hard to hear with its audio.  but a worthy contributor to those anthology shows if you've watched all the episodes of the great anthology show the twilight zone already.

3121052,4,B0013XZ70G,"I don't regret buying The Classic Sci-Fi TV collection but I think that science fiction fans should be warned that the twelve disc collection could be very rough sledding for those who are looking for good science fiction that has stood the test of time; those who are more interested in early television shows will like the collection much better.

 The Flash Gordon material is in poor shape but even if it were remastered it would only seem quaint; the actors playing Flash, Dale, and Dr. Zarkoff are the only actors in the series, filmed in West Germany, who were Americans and most of the other actors have German accents which is sometimes amusing but always distracting. The Captain Z-Ro material is aimed at the youngest elementary school children and the production values are primative, as is the writing and acting; I've watched a few episodes and I sincerely doubt I'll ever watch the remainder. The one Step Beyond episodes are arguably the best thing representing regular series in the collection and many of the 18 episodes still stand up fairly well but that series is one of the newest (a relative term) represented by the collection. Rocky Jones, Space Ranger is arguably the most watchable material in the entire collection, but Mill Creek has included about half of the three-episode adventures in edited form disguised as movies on other collections, so the risk of duplication is possible for those who have other Mill Creek products; since I'm able to compare both versions, I favor the original versions in this collection; the special effects in the Rocky Jones material was superior in its day but to anyone used to blue screens and CGI the effects will look amateurish. The Lights Out episodes really bring home the idea that television was originally regarded as radio with pictures and while it is to the credit of the actors and the director featured in the four episodes that they could work within the limitation of the medium in its infancy when everything was live and there were no retakes, anyone who is looking for contemporary production values, or even the production values of the late fifties television, will skip the episodes; Tales of Tomorrow features much the same sort of production values but with better preservation, stories, and a better class of actors.

 Movie serials were often shown by independent stations in the afternoon after school let out, back in the fifties and sixties, so the three serial included do deserve a place, but three may be overkill. I'm in the process of watching chapters of ""Radar Men from the Moon"" every Saturday and I am enjoying it but I like most serials; I have a truncated version of ""The Phantom Empire"" which was hacked up and re-edited so it could be passed off with another title (""Melody Ranch"") as a movie in another Mill Creek package, and I'm glad to have the original version even though I will admit the Gene Autry vehicle is a poorly done serial. I haven't looked at ""Undersea Kingdom"" but I have seen it before and I know it is mediocre of its kind, at best.

 The rest of the material in the collection is basically filler, but at least the anthology material does show that some fantasy and science fiction was aimed at a more mainstream audience. I've never cared much for made-for-televison limited animation cartoons and I watched one ""Captain Fathom"" and one ""Space Angel"" cartoon apiece before deciding I wouldn't be watching any others. The ""Clutch Cargo"" cartoon was interesting with its superimposure of a real mouth speaking dialogue over cartoon faces but it also struck me as jarring and disturbing. The selections from various anthology shows range all over the place but none are outstanding although it is interesting to see actors like Vincent Price, Joanne Woodward, Sheldon Leonard, Cloris Leachman, and Michael Rennie in the one-off format. The unsold pilot episodes are interesting, but apparently the episode of ""Thriller"" was included to fill out the fifth disc after ""Here Comes Tober"" and the live version of Captain Fathom were removed for copyright reasons. I did enjoy the pilots for ""Tales of Frankenstine"" and the 1958 Shadow pilot and I wish both had been developed into series, but they serve mostly as reminders of wasted potential. ""Johnny Jupiter"" features puppets and is aimed at a pre-school audience, and was obviously included as filler.

 All-in-all, the collection is uneven and almost none of it would appeal to a casual viewer of science fiction. Serial fans and those with a deep interest in early television will consider the set worth the price of ownership, but I doubt Mill Creek will find many viewers who will consider Classic Sci-Fi TV a bargain.",1360368000,3,4696,4.89070351758794

3121061,4,B0013XZ70G,"I agree the packaging of this product is lacking.  Paper sleeves in a large plastic box which tends to break in shipping.  My first set arrived with a badly broken box but the disks were undamaged.  The replacement was undamaged.

This is a very fun set!  Many of the programs on this set are either difficult to obtain or much more expensive elsewhere.

""Tales of Frankenstein"" is a Hammer Horror pilot that went unsold.  Unless the production expense of the show were a barrier I don't understand how this one failed to make the cut.  It's excellent!  It plays like a Hammer film but in 30 minutes.  It's one of the many rare gems on this collection.

Overall A/V quality is good to very good for these programs except for those done with kinescope.  Those are only fair due to the nature of that process.  Many prints are the best of the respective programs I've yet seen, especially the serials.  The exception are the remastered episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Step-Beyond-The-Official-First-Season/dp/B002DMJM7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Step Beyond: The Official First Season</a>.

While many might argue about the inclusion of the serials on this set these were shown on many Saturday TV Matinee programs as pre-movie ""shorts"" or post-movie fillers.  The episodes of ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger"" feels like a TV successor to these type films.  Good prints of the 3 serials are most welcome!

Sadly, the set seems to have gone into a ""second printing"" and the unsold pilot ""Here Comes Tobor"" (1956) has been dropped in favor of 2 more episodes of ""One Step Beyond"" (now 18 total).  I can only assume this was due to a rights issue.

The additional episodes of ""One Step Beyond"" are:

""The Clown""
""The Dark Room""

While some may consider the inclusion of movie serials to be a bit of a cheat on this set, one can argue that movie serials (and radio) served as a starting point of sorts for the early years of episodic television and, of course, the serials did eventually make their way to television's airwaves.  Perhaps the only major omission of a show with a paranormal flavor that is in the public domain and is not included in this set is Boris Karloff's limited series ""The Veil"" which, possibly, could have substituted for one of the serials.  Regardless, this 12-DVD set includes a mixture of some very common, some not so common, and some downright rare shows.  Arguably, the biggest ""find"" on this set is the inclusion of 24 episodes of ""Captain Z-Ro"" and, to the best of my knowledge, this set marks the commercial DVD debut of Boris Karloff's ""Thriller,"" a series that many fans have long desired to see on DVD.  Perhaps the inclusion of the ""Thriller"" episode ""The Return of Andrew Bentley"" might prompt further consideration for an official DVD release of this series in the future.  And those who previously purchased Mill Creek's 4-DVD set of 50 ""One Step Beyond"" episodes will be delighted to know that of the 16 episodes included here, only one episode (""Where Are They?"") is repeated from that earlier box set.

Among the unsold pilots, I enjoyed the second incarnation of ""The Shadow"" titled ""Invisible Avenger,"" which was filmed on location in New Orleans in the late 1950s and was eventually released theatrically, and ""Tales of Frankenstein.""  Don Megowan, who appears as the monster in ""Frankenstein"" also appears in the live action version of ""Captain Fathom,"" which plays like a low rent version of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.""  One also wonders about the possibilities of ""Destination Space"" had it been picked up as a regular series by CBS.  Though a bit on the talky side (especially in the middle scenes depicted on earth), the pilot featured solid performances from TV veterans like Harry Townes, Charles Aidman, Edward Platt, Whitney Blake and Gail Kobe, and had the backing of a major studio, Paramount.

As is the case with compilations of public domain shows, the audio/visual quality is all over the map and reflects a variety of sources such as kinescopes for the live shows and unrestored 16 millimeter syndication prints for many of the TV show episodes.  While none of the episodes that I have viewed so far are unwatchable, this is definitely not a set for videophiles, nor those expecting state-of-the-art special effects.  In fact, the special effects are downright primitive when compared to today's special effects and CGI.  But considering the low budgets for most of these productions, it's obvious that the SFX people were trying to do the best they could with the limited resources available to them and that's part of the charm of watching these early Sci-Fi TV efforts.

The variety of the shows included in this set is so broad that there is bound to be something to appeal to almost anyone who even remotely enjoys science fiction.  This set  is highly recommended for classic/vintage TV fans and those who enjoy the early days of science fiction on the small screen.  My rating is closer to **** &  for this release, just missing a full five stars given the variable audio/visual quality.",1239667200,159,4592,4.867609254498714
3355476,5,B0013XZ70G,"I run the Sci-Fi Lists website and I have to say I am more than happy with this outstanding collection of public domain TV episodes and cinematic serials. Despite what one other reviewer said, some of this stuff is extremely hard to find anywhere else... especially the 24 time-tripping episodes of Captain Z-Ro. When you add in the TV version of Flash Gordon (14eps) and the well-produced Rocky Jones (23eps) there is no escaping the fact that this set is value for money.

Criticism of the inclusion of cinematic serials is also unfair. They were repeated mercilessly during the early days of TV, with the good quality transfers of the Commando Cody adventure Radar Men From the Moon being the pick of the bunch. For sheer low-budget joy check out failed pilot Here Comes Tobor and the three nifty 'Synchro-Vox' Cambia animated series. The episodes of the various TV anthology series are also generally very well selected on the basis of their sci-fi content. No Captain Video, Tom Corbett or Space Patrol--but the cosmically canny sci-fi artefacts on offer are out of this world!",1237852800,66,1082,4.880434782608695
3355477,4,B0013XZ70G,"Any reviewer stating that this collection is a rip-off couldn't be more wrong in my opinion.  Mill Creek is a wonderful company that is one of the first distributors to provide public domain material at a budget, affordable price.  Their price structure is the same for all their 150 episode box sets. If you can wait a little while you will be able to pick this up for around $16 or less.  I couldn't recommend their other TV classics enough.  Their 3 Western and Detective releases are wonderful, and should be sought-out.  I have been asking Mill Creek to release a Sci-fi set this past year and they are now doing it and I couldn't be happier.  Since they are releasing public domain material, they have to stick with what they have available. I'm sure they are putting the serials on the set to not only fill space, but they must have thought they would fit in nicely with the Sci-fi theme.  I can't wait to watch some of these old episodes again.  Looks like good family fun.",1229558400,46,981,4.47191011235955

The price might be too high for this collection even if the majority of programs are basically pilot programs (ie The Shadow).  If the price was lower minus the serials it might be worth looking into.

CAPTAIN Z-RO is a pretty intelligent and educational show that must have been fun for kids back in the day. ONE STEP BEYOND was a Twilight Zone-style show supposedly based on true stories. CLUTCH CARGO, SPACE ANGEL and CAPTAIN FATHOM were examples of ""limited animation,"" a cost-saving method popular in the early 1960s.

A few serials from the 1930s are included, probably because they were shown on TV during the early years: the amazing UNDERSEA KINGDOM, and PHANTOM EMPIRE (gloriously silly - is it a western or a crime thriller or sci-fi?)

3355537,2,B0013XZ70G,"I took a chance on this one for $10 with Prime, and it's generally pretty lame. I was hoping for some Ed Woodesque ""so bad its amusing anyway"" type of entertainment and it's just mostly bad in a boring, irritating way. Captain Z-RO makes an attempt to be educational to the little children, but boring conversations in a ""space ship"" are still boring conversations and the kid is a terrible actor and rather odd-looking to boot so I can't even begin to explain that. The TV ""Flash Gordon"" is better but not by much. I will say that the ""Space Angel"" episodes are the best of the lot; I didn't care for it when I was a kid in the 60s but watching it from an adult's eyes I have to say its kinda trippy...LOL...And ""One Step Beyond"" has a couple nice episodes. But overall I recommend passing on this one.",1400976000,,803,4.324503311258278

Pretty old but in its own way cool.

3355542,4,B0013XZ70G,Wasn't exactly the TV show as I remember it.  Looking at some of the earlier movie serials that were likely put on TV.,1371168000,,118,4.130434782608695
3355543,4,B0013XZ70G,"another fantastic box of goodness. if only for Scott McCloud, Space Angel, I would recommend this box set! really fantastic, vintage stuff.",1367625600,,139,5.363636363636363
3355544,4,B0013XZ70G,"Undersea Kingdom--it has Ray Corrigan who does a decent job, Monte Blue (who was a sheriff in Key Largo and in a couple of Lone Ranger episodes too), Lon Chaney, Jr., and C. Montague Shaw who was in Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars--I liked him.

The Phantom Empire--has a young Gene Autry and started the whole singing cowboy thing i think.  also has Wheeler Oakman, and Warner Richmond who are seen in the Lost Jungle with Clyde Beatty, the famous lion tamer.  that one was good for its day if you are forgiving.  Wheeler was also in Darkest Africa which was the second Beatty serial.  Which, If you find you like The Phantom Empire you might like Darkest Africa which has a storyline i found to be one of the fun ones.  i am on the forgiving side but it was a decent adventure/jungle serial for its day.

Radar Men from the Moon--invaders from the moon.  good to see the moon men keep up with mars here.  can't not enjoy an invasion.  clayton moore (the Lone Ranger) is a henchman in this.  roy barcroft is retik the leader of the moon's invasion.  if you like this rocketman concept after watching this, you will want to know that there are three other serials with a rocketman.
those are all cliffhanger movie serials with several episodes not tv but good sci fi stuff if you like old sci fi.

Rocky Jones, Space Ranger--good if you like old sci fi and like it not so dark but more lighthearted and nonviolent.  i'm comparing it to the Tom Corbett, Space Cadet and Space Patrol i've seen on DVD with the quality rating of this comment.

Tales of Tomorrow--sci fi for those of us who have seen every twilight zone episode and are forgiving.  it's a little bit like a very early tv twilight zone.

Captain Z-Ro--educational sci fi.  if you're forgiving you can get into the concept.  you travel back in time and see historical figures in the majority of these.
and there is one great episode of General Electric Theater with Ronald Reagan and Cloris Leachman.  a little hard to hear with its audio.  but a worthy contributor to those anthology shows if you've watched all the episodes of the great anthology show the twilight zone already.
none of these reviewed above are violent and i was glad i watched them.",1367366400,6,2225,4.498753117206983

3355549,4,B0013XZ70G,"I don't regret buying The Classic Sci-Fi TV collection but I think that science fiction fans should be warned that the twelve disc collection could be very rough sledding for those who are looking for good science fiction that has stood the test of time; those who are more interested in early television shows will like the collection much better.

 The Flash Gordon material is in poor shape but even if it were remastered it would only seem quaint; the actors playing Flash, Dale, and Dr. Zarkoff are the only actors in the series, filmed in West Germany, who were Americans and most of the other actors have German accents which is sometimes amusing but always distracting. The Captain Z-Ro material is aimed at the youngest elementary school children and the production values are primative, as is the writing and acting; I've watched a few episodes and I sincerely doubt I'll ever watch the remainder. The one Step Beyond episodes are arguably the best thing representing regular series in the collection and many of the 18 episodes still stand up fairly well but that series is one of the newest (a relative term) represented by the collection. Rocky Jones, Space Ranger is arguably the most watchable material in the entire collection, but Mill Creek has included about half of the three-episode adventures in edited form disguised as movies on other collections, so the risk of duplication is possible for those who have other Mill Creek products; since I'm able to compare both versions, I favor the original versions in this collection; the special effects in the Rocky Jones material was superior in its day but to anyone used to blue screens and CGI the effects will look amateurish. The Lights Out episodes really bring home the idea that television was originally regarded as radio with pictures and while it is to the credit of the actors and the director featured in the four episodes that they could work within the limitation of the medium in its infancy when everything was live and there were no retakes, anyone who is looking for contemporary production values, or even the production values of the late fifties television, will skip the episodes; Tales of Tomorrow features much the same sort of production values but with better preservation, stories, and a better class of actors.

 Movie serials were often shown by independent stations in the afternoon after school let out, back in the fifties and sixties, so the three serial included do deserve a place, but three may be overkill. I'm in the process of watching chapters of ""Radar Men from the Moon"" every Saturday and I am enjoying it but I like most serials; I have a truncated version of ""The Phantom Empire"" which was hacked up and re-edited so it could be passed off with another title (""Melody Ranch"") as a movie in another Mill Creek package, and I'm glad to have the original version even though I will admit the Gene Autry vehicle is a poorly done serial. I haven't looked at ""Undersea Kingdom"" but I have seen it before and I know it is mediocre of its kind, at best.

 The rest of the material in the collection is basically filler, but at least the anthology material does show that some fantasy and science fiction was aimed at a more mainstream audience. I've never cared much for made-for-televison limited animation cartoons and I watched one ""Captain Fathom"" and one ""Space Angel"" cartoon apiece before deciding I wouldn't be watching any others. The ""Clutch Cargo"" cartoon was interesting with its superimposure of a real mouth speaking dialogue over cartoon faces but it also struck me as jarring and disturbing. The selections from various anthology shows range all over the place but none are outstanding although it is interesting to see actors like Vincent Price, Joanne Woodward, Sheldon Leonard, Cloris Leachman, and Michael Rennie in the one-off format. The unsold pilot episodes are interesting, but apparently the episode of ""Thriller"" was included to fill out the fifth disc after ""Here Comes Tober"" and the live version of Captain Fathom were removed for copyright reasons. I did enjoy the pilots for ""Tales of Frankenstine"" and the 1958 Shadow pilot and I wish both had been developed into series, but they serve mostly as reminders of wasted potential. ""Johnny Jupiter"" features puppets and is aimed at a pre-school audience, and was obviously included as filler.

 All-in-all, the collection is uneven and almost none of it would appeal to a casual viewer of science fiction. Serial fans and those with a deep interest in early television will consider the set worth the price of ownership, but I doubt Mill Creek will find many viewers who will consider Classic Sci-Fi TV a bargain.",1360368000,3,4696,4.89070351758794

On these Sci-Fi DVD's the picture is smooth and there is little little loss of action but they lack sharpness making hard to see details.  It is if they are just a bit out of focus.  For the money it is acceptable.,1294790400,5,425,4.146341463414634
3355558,4,B0013XZ70G,"I agree the packaging of this product is lacking.  Paper sleeves in a large plastic box which tends to break in shipping.  My first set arrived with a badly broken box but the disks were undamaged.  The replacement was undamaged.

This is a very fun set!  Many of the programs on this set are either difficult to obtain or much more expensive elsewhere.

""Tales of Frankenstein"" is a Hammer Horror pilot that went unsold.  Unless the production expense of the show were a barrier I don't understand how this one failed to make the cut.  It's excellent!  It plays like a Hammer film but in 30 minutes.  It's one of the many rare gems on this collection.

Overall A/V quality is good to very good for these programs except for those done with kinescope.  Those are only fair due to the nature of that process.  Many prints are the best of the respective programs I've yet seen, especially the serials.  The exception are the remastered episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Step-Beyond-The-Official-First-Season/dp/B002DMJM7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Step Beyond: The Official First Season</a>.

While many might argue about the inclusion of the serials on this set these were shown on many Saturday TV Matinee programs as pre-movie ""shorts"" or post-movie fillers.  The episodes of ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger"" feels like a TV successor to these type films.  Good prints of the 3 serials are most welcome!

Sadly, the set seems to have gone into a ""second printing"" and the unsold pilot ""Here Comes Tobor"" (1956) has been dropped in favor of 2 more episodes of ""One Step Beyond"" (now 18 total).  I can only assume this was due to a rights issue.

The additional episodes of ""One Step Beyond"" are:

""The Clown""
""The Dark Room""

Both of these appear on the Mill Creek&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Very-Best-of-One-Step-Beyond/dp/B000RPCT5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Very Best of One Step Beyond</a>&nbsp;set as well as a few other PD collections.

As far as Mill Creek adding the following Movie Serials:

Radar Men from the Moon

The Undersea Kingdom

I'm glad they did.

To top it off even--- They've included an episode of ----Clutch Cargo!!

I have wanted them for my collection anyway---these titles are a great bonus.
I would have paid 11.99(which is what I paid) for just those serials in the first place.
Yes many are in public domain, but downloading can be pain.
