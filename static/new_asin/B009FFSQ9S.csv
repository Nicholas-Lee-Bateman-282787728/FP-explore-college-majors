5324204,5,B009FFSQ9S,"Of all of the branches of service honored for service on D-Day The US NAVY was left out. This film shows that after many years someone woke up and initiated a depiction of the Navy's role on that terrible day of combat.. A beautiful statue of three ranks of sailors was beautiful cast and now stands in the area of the battleground honoring those sailors.

A sailor of another war that followed this one..........Korea",1427328000,,418,4.648648648648648
5324205,5,B009FFSQ9S,"Fantastic historical account, and one that you do not hear about often when the battle in Normandy is discussed, of the U.S. Navy's role and the horrific outcome which would have been much more different had not those ""Tin Cans"" gotten within spitting distance of the shoreline.",1424822400,,278,4.9361702127659575

5324211,5,B009FFSQ9S,"The Navy was a big reason for the success at Normandy.  They also valiantly shared in the loss of life.  This was a tearful reminder to us all what these brave men went through on June 6, 1944.",1403481600,,193,4.052631578947368
5324212,5,B009FFSQ9S,"This is a well narrated presentation about the US Navy's participation in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day and the statue commissioned to represent US Naval involvement. Follow the designer, Steven Spears, as he creates the design and attends the commemoration ceremony in Normandy. The original footage offers a glimpse into the D-Day invasion. Interviews and photographs add a personal dimension. Many in Normandy still honor the memory of those who fought and died during the invasion. Their comments are poignant as they express their sentiments. Their stories have been past on from generation to generation. The events of 6 June 1944 are still taught in their school system.

Recommended for those with an interest in military history and for beginners. Also recommended  for those with an interest in WWII monuments and their locations.

Suggested viewing: David Winters ""Hang Tough"" (Tim Gray).",1389052800,,903,5.345070422535211
8540968,5,B009FFSQ9S,"Beautiful is the monument for these men of untold bravery.  Their spirits so valient as they dutifully ran  directly into the gunfire they knew was there,  God bless them.  LET ALL GENERATIONS KNOW WHAT THEY ENDURED FOR OUR FREEDOM.",1530144000,,232,4.871794871794871
8540969,3,B009FFSQ9S,"The first 40 minutes is mostly a documentary. It is good, but nothing new. The narrator sounds a bit constipated, and is reading in a style similar to the silly newscast voices we hear on TV today - sentences blurted out with heavy phrasing on different segments. No real person talks that way.

The last 20 minutes seems to be a discourse around the new sculpture that some artist made for one of the D-Day landing sites. I skipped through most of that.",1484265600,,454,4.469879518072289
8540970,5,B009FFSQ9S,I give it five stars as a documentary that covers a story no others have covered.  It was all the forces working together that made this whole war come out as a victory.  Nice to get another group of stories from the Naval side of things.  Great story great cinematics of the battle.  Really well done.,1456531200,,302,4.339285714285714

8540973,2,B009FFSQ9S,"Maybe I'm missing something here, but it shows on the side of the monument a list of all the ships who fought in the campaign. Probably a third of those ships were actually United States Coast Guard Cutters operated by Coast Guardsmen, not the Navy. Not to take anything away from the Navy, but hey, give us something other than the scraps. If you're Navy, congratulations, I mean no disrespect to you. But if you are a Coastie, it's just typical of what they do to us. ""Simply Forgot Us"" instead of ""Semper Paratus."" Go watch The Guardian instead.",1451606400,,548,4.545454545454546
