1046845,1,6305556806,"Please give us a proper CD Twilight Collection on the 40 th anniversary of this greatness. How about releasing a collection by beginning with the first episode then next the number  two episode and then on.
How about making use of this brilliant idea of mine and stop  releasing strange collections of this nature.",969667200,13,314,4.796296296296297
1046846,3,6305556806,"I have to agree with the other reviews, its great to have a collection of wonderful TLZ episodes but the packaging makes this a poor collection, stardard CD boxes, packed into a Cardboard box, hardly makes for a Good  Giftpack, nor a great way to celebrate an Anniversary. Poor show Panasonic",948844800,8,292,4.7254901960784315
1046847,1,6305556806,"It's not necessary to discuss the series. They are classics, they are good BUT the preparation of this set is the most awful thing I've ever seen. First the DVDs are placed in a standart CD box, and the look really  terrible next to other DVDs. There are no subtitles which are very  necessary for foreigners like me. After seeing such a set I cannot say  ""happy new 40 years"" :-(((((((",947635200,19,386,4.408450704225352
1046848,4,6305556806,"I agree that the selection of episodes in the gift pack (as is also true of the regular DVD releases of TZ episodes) represents more of a random sampling than an only-the-best selection.  Nonetheless, I'm quite pleased  with the overall quality of the included episodes.  While segments like  ""Probe 7--Over and Out"" are mediocre at best, the collection  still includes classics like ""Time Enough at Last"", ""A Game  of Pool"" (with terrific performances from Jack Klugman and Jonathan  Winters), and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.""  Of the 19 episodes, I  find 15 of them to be well worth owning--not a bad ratio.  I'm also  impressed with the Rod Serling documentary included in this set.  Rather  than an insipid fluff piece about how wonderful TZ is (which is  unfortunately the more common type of ""documentary feature""  usually included in DVD products), this is a satisfyingly in-depth look at  Rod Serling's entire career which aired on PBS as part of the  ""American Masters"" series.  A nice bonus.
I do agree that the  packaging is sub-par.  No liner notes, and all discs are crammed into 2-CD  jewel boxes.  This is unimpressive for an ""anniversary tribute""  set.  These drawbacks are purely cosmetic, though, and do not detract from  my enjoyment of the set.
The transfer is generally well executed,  capturing the contrast and detail of the often striking black-and-white  cinematography.  At its best, TZ is like classic film noir distilled into  24-minute doses.  The two episodes originally shot on videotape instead of  film for budgetary reasons (""Night of the Meek"" and ""Long  Distance Call"") fare less well, but this is to be expected.
So:  Overall, a good sampling of episodes with a satisfying bonus documentary.  I thoroughly enjoy it.",946684800,39,1751,5.049295774647887

7891411,1,6305556806,"This set has no special intrinsic value; it is the first half of the TZ Volume 1 DVD Collection, which only goes for seventy bucks at most retail outlets; I say again, don't pay almost one-hundred bucks for 50% of what you can have at under seventy! Additionally, there is noting special about this set; the DVDs aren't even packaged per standard--they're in CD jewl cases, loosly packed in box...",1106784000,6,397,4.685714285714286
7891412,3,6305556806,"If you are a serious collector -- or if you are shopping for a gift for a big fan of this show -- then you really should investigate the ""Twilight Zone Collection"" box sets.
The entire series is available in a total of 5 sets. This 40th Anniversary Gift Pack is not comprehensive enough for a serious collector. It contains exactly the same material as Vol 1-5 of ""Collection 1,"" which goes beyond that, all the way to Vol 9.",1043625600,29,425,4.325
7891413,1,6305556806,I cant believe how cheaply they packaged this set.  I have a twilight zone collection and each volume is packaged in a classy DVD cover.  I was expecting 5 volumes that had the similar package.......WRONG......They have put these DVD's in a cheap plastic CD holder that is a totally different size and look than the rest of the collection.  I would rather pay the difference and get the volumes individually.  WHAT A CHEAP WAY TO PACKAGE THIS PRODUCT.  ESPECIALLY WHEN MOST OF US BUY THEM TO COLLECT.  TALK ABOUT DISAPPOINTMENT!,1034985600,31,528,4.811111111111111
7891414,5,6305556806,"'Twilight Zone's Next Century  ' Its A Great Book Better than the original Twilight Zone. Written and created by a ex-step son of James Serling's Rod Serling's 1st cousin. Michael J.Sudore Author Of Twilighjt Zone's Next Century.
Buy this book its a great novel. Some people think Sudore is a actual Blood relative of the Serling's because he looks like Rod and he has his imagination. Some people think he has powers because he come up with these stories from the top of his head.
A story out of his book is about the Witch who becoomes fat she eats a piece of pie, and she explodes into seven witches all seven inches tall all the same existance of the witch.
I don't want to spoil the book or tv stories of sudore's read it all, his stories are out of this world. and they are new.",1031788800,2,784,4.333333333333333
7891415,5,6305556806,"Twilight Zone is one of the most creative pieces of Americana. What Serling succeeded in doing was to combine a first rate scifi imagination with a concern for the human condition and the basic questions of existence. He questions, he doubts, he moralizes, but without overt preaching. Instead, he gives us his imaginative tales that combine suspense and innovative plots, meaningful characters and strange circumstances. All this entertains and teaches a lesson at the same time. And you are likely to learn something new from Serling's biography, which is also included in the 40th Anniversary Gift Set. Owning The Twilight Zone is like owning a piece of America.",1015286400,3,665,5.166666666666667

""I have seen every episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" ""Its a Great Wild Tv Show.""
""I have purchased the book's ""Twilight Zone Companion""  ""Twilight Zone 2000, ""Tz2k"" Written By, Rod Serling's ...
  ""Author Mark Zicree, did a perfect job on the book  ""Twilight Zone Companion,"" It tells all about the Tv Show right from the very first episode.""
""The Next Twilight Zone 2000"" ""TZ2K Book, has all new stories that I thought, I was never going to see in this life time.""
 ""I was surprized because you all know there is nothing but re-written and re-runned movies, like the stories in book's and Tv inc.""
""This book is really great just like Rod Serling's "" Twilight Zone classical show,"" Only with bran new stories that are wild, and there very interesting.""
""I know one thing ""The Twilight Zone will never die, the memories of Rod Serling remain along with his great tv show  ""The Twilight Zone,"" that still airs on the scifi tv station.""
""Now that this book is out in the web, it's carring a ""Next Twilight Zone,"" right into our living rooms and dens and bedrooms and 30% Percent of the population doesn't even know it exist.""
  I'm guessing!""Which means the Author of this book is well trained by Rod Serling, and he asking for a 50 Million dollars in contract's to air his stories on Television, or he says he will just sell the book on the street corners, or perform Tv Commercial's to adverise the book ""Tz2k.'
""I know one thing, When this book does become fully exposed in the United States Of America, it will sell out fast, The Graphics on the front cover are very attractive. and the stories inside the book are supernatural, meaning they are really good, there new, wild, bizzare, fascinating, entertaining.""

7891418,5,6305556806,"Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect and integrity. Ahead of his time and somewhat less respected because of the genre he worked within and made him famous, he is now recognized as one of the great pioneers into the realm of sophisticated storytelling combing intellect and emotion. His great vision and realization, ""The Twilight Zone"" remains a testament of his contribution to the Arts and Humanity. It has been said ""Man does not live by bread alone."" This 40th Anniversary Gift Set is very representative of ""The Twilight Zone"" television series. There are 19 episodes included. They are not all classics but they do show the diversity of the series held together by a common theme and I think that is what strengthens this set. The 90 minute feature, ""ROD SERLING: Submitted For Your Approval"" which I originally viewed on Public Television is also included. It is one of the best biographical documentaries I have ever seen. Of the 19 episodes included there are some truly great titles such as ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,"" ""Kick the Can,"" ""Night of the Meek,"" ""Two,"" ""I Sing the Body Electric"" and ""Walking Distance"" and ""The Lonely,"" both with heartfelt and endearing Bernard Herrmann scores. This is a good way to start collecting ""The Twilight Zone"" on DVD. These transfers are excellent and truly have to be seen to be appreciated.",987292800,40,1366,4.892241379310345

Save for four or five selections, the rest are just throwaways.  Where's ""The New Exhibit"" or some of the other underrated hour-long episodes?  We'll have to wait and see, I guess.
