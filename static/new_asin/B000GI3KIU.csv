8132343,5,B000GI3KIU,"When Manhattan Transfer's first album came out (back in the 60's/70's), I was hooked.  I've bought all of their CD's & as many DVD's as I could find through the years.  There are not many groups that have the staying power that this group has had.  Only one other comes to mind & that's the Rolling Stones.  I had always wondered why they never did a DVD of their Christmas performances, but (in any case) it's well worth the wait.  The song arrangements, their harmony, their professionalism makes them top-notch and a better performance that you can't find anywhere else.",1278201600,,573,4.69
8132344,5,B000GI3KIU,For those who like the manhattan transfer as much as i do then this is the dvd for you. It has all the classics from their two christmas cd's and i love the way they are deck out in their suits and dresses and the music is wonderful.,1193443200,7,233,3.875
