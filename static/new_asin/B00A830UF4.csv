8548141,5,B00A830UF4,"Okay, I'll admit it: I love these two movies. ""Bill & Ted"" is so utterly silly and dumb that if you don't laugh, you're taking life way too seriously. I'm not addicted to ""Dude . . . ,"" but it makes this DVD an excellent double-header for an evening when you just want to relax. Keanu Reeves looks about 14 years old, which makes sense. At his age now (50-ish?), he looks 35. Must be that red pill.",1497830400,,398,4.115384615384615
