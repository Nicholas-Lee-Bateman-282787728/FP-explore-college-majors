3669299,4,B000FS2WJY,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars was the fact that it was older footage. However, there were some cases and people I never knew about, which kept me watching. Glad I did, it was very interesting to hear normal, down to earth, ordinary folk talk about extraordinary occurrences with aliens. Entertaining without any bells and whistles, worth a watch.",1497139200,,352,4.786885245901639
3669300,5,B000FS2WJY,"I loved this 2 hour documentary a vEry informative  movie. I was not sure of any of the gentlemen discussing the UFO subject I quickly did some research and felt 100% satisfied with the info comparing it to my own experiences and reading over past 30 years. COMPARING to David Icke, Jim Marrs leaders in conspiracies theories Bravo !",1496188800,2,333,4.6440677966101696
3669301,4,B000FS2WJY,"This slow-paced but fascinating documentary (almost 2 hours long) features several of the classical UFO contactees: George Adamski, Daniel Fry and Howard Menger. We also meet Desmond Leslie, who co-wrote ""The flying saucers have landed"" with Adamski, Howard Menger's wife Connie Menger and several people who were friends or followers of Adamski or Menger. Briefly, ""UFO Secret"" also shows Zecheriah Sitchin and Richard Thompson. No sceptics are included on the show, not even token ones. This is for true believers, romantics and people with a nostalgic longing for the simpler times of benign space brothers, long before the alien abductions and wild conspiracy theories.

I learned a few things from this documentary. In a previous review, I suggested that Steven Greer is a new look contactee. However, judging by ""UFO Secret"", the new look is pretty similar to the old look.

Adamski claimed to have met Pope John XXIII and the UN Secretary-General U Thant. He further claimed to have briefed scientists on the UFO question, and talked to representatives from both the Pentagon and NASA. He really *did* meet Queen Juliana of Holland. Adamski's followers talked about free energy and how vested interests in society wanted to stop this knowledge from coming out. There was also some confusion over whether Adamski's aliens were physical or spiritual beings, with Adamski insisting on the former, while preaching a message of a Theosophical nature. This sounds eerily similar to Steven Greer, down to the details!

Howard Menger also made incredible claims. Apparently, he retro-engineered an alien craft together with government scientists. The project was top secret, and as a patriotic citizen, Menger agreed not to disclose anything and even to drop out of the UFO subculture. Unfortunately, the documentary doesn't say when the interview with Menger was made - if it was recently, I suppose it's possible that the old contactee decided to don the mantle of Bob Lazar. He retro-engineered himself, so to speak.

Another interesting aspect is the constant contradiction (already mentioned) between seeing the aliens as physical, and seeing them as spirit-beings. This seems to have been something of a sensitive issue with Adamski. At one point, Leslie suggested that perhaps Adamski's colourful journeys to other planets were really a form of astral travel, but Adamski would have none of it. It would only ""confuse the issue"", he said. Clearly, Adamski wanted to be seen as a kind of nuts-and-bolts UFO researcher, perhaps as a cover for his Theosophical message.

Menger is even more contradictory, but perhaps (in a sense, at least) more honest. At one point, he calls the aliens ""angels"". He admits that there was something strange about his own trip to the Moon in a flying saucer: it seems to have taken ten days, but Menger was just as clean-shaven when he came back as when he left. Menger proposes that perhaps he never left the Earth at all, and that the ""travel"" was somehow done with the aid of incomprehensible alien technology. Holograms? Or astral travel...? A friend of Menger reveals that the alien he and Menger encountered in a wood in New Jersey looked like an apparition, rather than an actual physical being. On the other hand, Menger's aliens are extremely human-like (one of them looks like his wife!) and he did claim to have retro-engineered a physical UFO.

This curious contradiction could, in the best of cases, be explained by Menger having a genuine spiritual experience at some point in his childhood or early youth. This experience was then embellished with ""physical"" traits as time went by. Leslie is quite perceptive (or wily, if you are a sceptic) when pointing to Paul's statement about a journey to the third heaven in the New Testament. Paul didn't know whether he was in his body (physical) or out of his body (spiritual). Of course, the credibility of the contactees would be somewhat strengthened if they would claim to have had spiritual experiences - instead, they constantly ""confuse the issue"" with their talk about alien craft, free energy, retro-engineering, contacts with the government, etc.

Ironically, ""UFO Secret"" is beset with the same contradiction. It certainly sounds as if the narrator considers UFOs to be physical, alien space ships from other planets (perhaps even planets within our own solar system). However, several of the people interviewed at the beginning of the program are religious. Thompson is a member of the Hare Krishna movement, and his book ""Alien Identities"" looks at the UFO phenomenon from a Hindu perspective. Sitchin claimed to be an independent researcher, but at bottom his group seems to have been just another New Age sect, with Enki as God as Sitchin himself as prophet. Leslie at one point actually mentions the Theosophists!

""UFO Secret"" might not be the most exciting UFO documentary around, if want you want is action, excitement or infotainment. Another reviewer called it ""boring"" (a Star Wars fan, presumably). However, if you have an unnatural obsession with the more ""fringey"" strands of the UFO subculture, this might be precisely what you are looking for.",1351900800,6,5164,5.117437722419929
3669302,5,B000FS2WJY,George Adamski is as misunderstood now as he was in the 50's and 60's. If people will pay attention instead of looking for Hollywood style special effects they may learn something. Desmond Leslie and George Adamski created quite a body of information based upon both research and George Adamski's direct contact with our brothers from other planets. Keep an open mind. You may learn something very valuable.,1276992000,,407,5.08955223880597
3669303,1,B000FS2WJY,I found that this CD was Boring.  I don't recommend spending the money to get this DVD.  The DVD was released in 2006 but all of the interviews were from years ago.  There was occassional interesting facts but for the most part it was a sleeper.,1167177600,3,245,4.282608695652174

8316069,5,B000FS2WJY,"Fear mongering is what Religions and Governments do in order for them to enslave a people in that the people choose their slavery so that their Government and their Religion can be the savior; therefore, expect for Governments and Religions to scream ""Look out! It is the Aliens from outer space and they are the devil"" just like Governments and Religions say about Recreational Cannabis, and that the people should allow their Government and their Religion to have full control of the People's freedom; then the Governments and Religions will move into a higher phase as slave-masters in which the slaves will not revolt from their slavery, and then the end result is a New World Order with a New Slave-Master, and it worked successfully by using the strategy known as fear mongering, and it deceived The World unlike any other! Imagine Adam and Eve as innocent Aliens placed on Earth in which Human Beings were already here, and Human Beings were corrupt with Religions and Governments, and Adam and Eve were converted by Religions which would be The Talking Serpent because it talks to you in conversion, and Adam and Eve were now Religious to the Human Beings' Governments which would be The Tree Of Knowledge Of Good and Evil, and now Adam and Eve are slaves; then look at what happened to Jesus Christ for he was an Alien as well, and the hated him because he would not act Religious and they verbally attacked him calling him a alcoholic winebibber, and a glutton always celebrating with the sinners, and Jesus Christ then fought back, and the Religions and Governments then murdered Jesus Christ. Now ask yourself, ""Who truly is the 'Real Devil and Real Satan' on this Planet Earth?"" And notice your answer is Religions and Governments; thus, The Talking Serpent which are Religions, and The Tree Of Knowledge Of Good And Evil which are Governments, and to no surprise ""they are death!""

8316071,2,B000FS2WJY,"Focuses almost exclusively on one of the original UFO hucksters, George Adamski.  Adamski claimed that he was taking rides on alien spaceships back in the 1950s, many years before the modern era of ""alien abduction"" and other such close encounters of the fourth kind.  This documentary tries hard to portray Adamski as a credible contactee; more than that, it eventually portrays him as an alien-human hybrid who acted as an intermediary between alien and human cultures.  In actuality, Adamski was more like a cult leader (like a benign Charles Manson), inasmuch as his followers and friends would emphatically verify his UFO ""miracles"" for decades beyond Adamski's death.  However, this documentary importantly omits the many, many times that Adamski was proven to be a fraud and a huckster.  Similarly, the featured early contactee Howard Menger is portrayed as a credible figure, but his failings are deliberately omitted, also.  Menger was more like a copycat of Adamski, but Menger actually backtracked and revised his stories over the years, eventually modifying them into religious experiences.  To be clear, this film is trying to SELL YOU on the histories and legacies of George Adamski and Howard Menger; but it's not providing the whole story.",1510444800,5,1255,5.245

I rated the film at 3 stars.",1497225600,,305,3.9672131147540983
