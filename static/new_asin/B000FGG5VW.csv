If I had seen the front I would have known that this is definately NOT what I wanted to order. I'm a college student just trying to get her fav Disney classics on DVD, I guess I'll just have to hope I can use it in my classroom one day. *tear*",1219104000,,384,4.0
8621607,1,B000FGG5VW,Since I am new to this I didn't realize there were different versions of Sleeping Beauty so I was disappointed when I received it and it wasn't the Disney version.  I bought it for my granddaughter and the only good thing is that it is short (about 30 minutes).  I would not recommend it.,1191283200,25,288,4.314814814814815
