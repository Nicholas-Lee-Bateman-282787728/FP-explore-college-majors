211308,4,6300147967,I really enjoyed this movie.  I borrowed it from my university library and now I can't wait until it is released on DVD so that I can buy it!,1046995200,7,141,3.8620689655172415
211309,5,6300147967,"Sure wish this was available in widescreen DVD format. A sweet little film, if a bit predicable and pushing saccharine. Perhaps Conti's best performance, though, and Giancarlo is wonderfully understated.",1040515200,11,203,5.8
211310,5,6300147967,"This movie was never noticed in theaters, and is not available on DVD.  I stumbled across it by accident  - it sounded like fun in a rental store.  It was not only fun, but Pope Leo is a warm, real character who brings life to the church - and to real meanings in life.  Catholics and non-Catholics alike must respond when he tells someone making excuses, ""Ultimately, we are responsible.""  This has become a family quote.  It is easy to watch, but also makes you think, and can be taken on many levels for the spiritually minded who question right, wrong, the meaning of life, spirit, truth.  I love this movie!",1006560000,22,612,4.45945945945946
211311,5,6300147967,"This is a wonderful film with great sensitivity, humour and fun which gives one an insight into 'a few days in the life of the Pope'.  The acting and the humour is superb and one quickly comes alongside the Pope with encouragement when he breaks out of the 'closet' and the closetted environment he is unwilling to conform to.  Throughout the film one is drawn into and carried along the emotional triangles that develop.  As the film is centered around the inhabitants within a small Italian mountain village one gets drawn into their life situations which gives one a good sense and experience of genuine Italian culture and behaviour that left me thinking I knew them personally and intimately.  The film is a wonderful celebration of Christian principles and is responsible for my 3 children becoming Christians.  I have seen this film twice and would dearly love to have my own personal copy as every time I have watched it something new is gained from it and, to this day I still reflect on the content.",995414400,25,1009,4.7102272727272725

211329,5,6300147967,"I saw this movie years ago on its release. Terrific story line and is a mix of drama and humor delivered as no one but Tom Conti could do.
It will make you laugh and cry and celebrate humanity through the eyes of a man tasked with the daunting responsibility of of the highest recognized spiritual leadership role in the world.  So happy to have this in my collection.",1465862400,,368,4.333333333333333

Just been on holiday to Rome and visited the Vatican, so would have loved to watch this film now I'm back home. Tom Conti is outstanding in a memorable and moving story.",1443657600,,277,3.9642857142857144

211369,2,6300147967,"Definitely a ""meh""!  Tom Conti is a good actor, but this story of a Pope who sneaks out of the Vatican to see the real world is just too bland and TV movie-ish.  Not worth the time.",1441497600,,181,3.864864864864865

211371,4,6300147967,"If the Vatican made a Hallmark film, this would be it.  Warm and fuzzy, predictable, overly simplistic, and enough saccharine to gag Shirley Temple.  If this kind of stuff doesn't float your boat, watch it purely for the joy of seeing Tom Conti.  He says more with his eyes that Olivier ever could with his whole body and soul.  His scene with his temporary landlady are absolutely touching and soul stirring.  It has been said that Conti is the Giancarlo Giannini of Britain -- and what a pleasure it is to see them acting together, although Giannini could have been given more scenes in this viewer's opinion.

I don't like these kinds of films as a rule -- but this was a true pleasure.",1440979200,,689,4.516129032258065

211474,5,6300147967,I had this same film on vhs and now on dvd.  It's about a pope who feels dissatisfied and is looking for something but doesn't know what.  There are some excellent scenes in this film and is a film that nearly everyone can watch and really enjoy.,1400198400,,246,4.212765957446808
211475,5,6300147967,"I loved this years ago and now finally have my own dvd.  It's funny, touching, and Tom Conti plays the kind of Pope you'd love to have come to dinner.  Pope Francis must be modeled after him.",1399507200,,191,4.135135135135135

211478,5,6300147967,I am just thrilled!  This is my favorite movie of all time.  I thought we were going to have to keep our VHS player forever so I could continue to play this movie.  I happened to Google it today and WHOO HOO it is now available on DVD!  Did someone hear us fans and realize there was a market?  However it happened I am so glad it did.  This is my go-to movie when world events get me down too much.  I watch this movie and feel a bit better.  Thank you thank you to whatever group decided to put this on DVD!!!!!,1397952000,,513,3.912621359223301
211479,5,6300147967,"I saw this film in the late 80s, and it permanently fixed itself in my mind for ever.  My VHS tape wore out years ago, so words can not convey how happy it made me when I found it available on DVD here.  I just wish it was available via Amazon Instant Video.

It is a must see film.",1396569600,,282,3.7457627118644066

211481,5,6300147967,Saw this movie many years ago and had been looking for it in all media. Tom Conti is superb in this role and it's easy to liken his character to our new pope Francesco. Thanks!,1395446400,,176,4.057142857142857
211482,5,6300147967,This is one of the marvelous movies that everyone should see. I don't get tired of seeing it. A must see,1395360000,,104,4.0
211483,5,6300147967,"We had seen this movie in the theatre years ago, when it first came out, and we liked it very much then. Now, with the new Pope Francis, literally creating a stir because he has ministered to the poor on the streets of Rome, we decided to revisit the movie. We are glad we purchased it, because it is one of those films that you like to show others. Very well acted. A delightful, meaningful film.",1392163200,,397,4.2368421052631575
211501,5,6300147967,I wonder if Pope Frances has seen it.  He'd like it.  A very good movie and one that we remembered for years so ordered it again.  Not disappointed.,1391731200,,148,4.214285714285714
211502,5,6300147967,The acting is great. The scenery is great. The subject is great. I would recommend it to everyone. No shootings. No explosions.,1390867200,,127,4.818181818181818
211503,5,6300147967,This is one of Tom Conti's best little movies.  I won't describe the plot or anything.  It is almost unavailable but deserves a wider audience.,1389830400,,143,4.68
211504,5,6300147967,One of my most favorite films. It is almost so true to life in following the activites of the newly elected Pope.,1389052800,,113,4.181818181818182
211505,5,6300147967,This is a timely release of a great movie about a pope who wants to touch the real world.  It is touching and funny at the same time.,1389052800,,133,3.75
211506,5,6300147967,"An enchanting story that made us both laugh and cry.  The film was made as fiction, but now?!?  Maybe not so much!  Tom Conti portrays a gentle and loving pope who wants to know how people live outside the walls of the Vatican, and ends up going incognito into an isolated village to live...  `Have you seen the Pope lately?' is a great story line.  Maybe at night someone at the Vatican is now saying that for real.  God Bless Pope Francis!  Loved this movie and highly recommend it.",1388707200,,484,4.370786516853933
211507,5,6300147967,"We waited a long time for this DVD to surface, but it is worth the wait.  It is a great movie to share with family and friends, and it has a wonderful story line with some great lessons.  Tom Conti plays an inspirational pope who could have taken lessons from Pope Francis, except Pope Francis came later.  This movie is not religious, and may not be theologically correct, but it offers a practical model to build ""the Kingdom of God"".",1388707200,,436,4.425
211508,5,6300147967,"Tom Conti as the Pope...  after a year, he is feeling disconnected from 'the people' because of the necessary responsibilities of the position...  he accidentally locks himself out of the Vatican (he is wearing civilian clothes), and decides to 'go walkabout' and reconnect with 'the common people' he had become a priest in order to serve...

a wonderful story...  I recommend to anyone and everyone...

211509,5,6300147967,"Given the actions and suspected excursions among the poor outside of  Vatican walls of the current Pope, this older film almost seems like a ""prophetic"" story about what a Pope could be. Tom Conti plays a Pope so pastoral and humble that he has a hard time keeping the distance from the people that his Vatican ""keepers"" try to impose on him. Through a funny accident he ends up locked out of the Vatican in ordinary clothes. Instead of trying to get back in, he goes off in search of a way to reconnect with the people while the Vatican brass tries to cove for him in pathetic and comic ways. This little film is sweet and seemed completely implausible when it first came out, but now it seems astonishingly possible and real. Try it! You'll be surprised.",1388448000,,756,4.478260869565218
211510,4,6300147967,"This is probably my all-time favorite film. I own two copies on VHS -- purchased at a premium after the film was out of print. I wanted one copy to lend out and one to keep safely at home. For years I have eagerly waited and hoped for the film to be released on DVD, so when I saw that it finally had been, I ordered it without hesitation.

The film itself gets 5 stars from me because it has everything -- drama, comedy, spirit, bad guys vs. good guys, a touch of romance, and even a bit of syrup. Have tissues handy.

The DVD version gets 4 stars from me because between my hearing loss and the strong accents of some characters, I have always relied on the captions on the VHS to fully understand the dialogue. But the DVD has no captions! Who takes a captioned film from VHS and puts it without captions onto DVD?! Who? I'll tell you who. MGM is who.

I will be very cautious about buying MGM DVDs in the future!",1387152000,,916,4.134831460674158
211511,5,6300147967,Tom Conti is always worth watching.  He brings life to his characters and he always seems to pick worthwhile scripts.,1386547200,,117,4.85

211514,5,6300147967,I showed this movie to some friends about the time Pope Francis was elected.  It seemed appropriate as the humility of both men is very evident,1384819200,,143,4.5
211515,5,6300147967,I am so glad this movie is now available on cd.  I saw it many years ago. It has a great message.  I suggest you give it a try.,1379808000,,127,3.3448275862068964
211516,5,6300147967,"This is a really sweet film about faith, relationship and hope.  Tom Conti is gentle and humorous as the Pope who misses everyday ""hands-on"" ministry to people and longs to be ""in the trenches"" again.  When he gets the opportunity to be anonymous and help a small village, he takes it, much to the chagrin of his staff at the Vatican, who must cover for him in his absence.  This leads to many humorous scenes, but also many tender and poignant scenes in the small village, where he is working to restor dignity and hope among the defeated townspeople.  I also appreciated this film for its respect of faith, and its portrayal of the struggle to hold on to faith in the midst of life's difficulties.  All in all, a very sweet and meaningful film.",1378339200,,746,4.496296296296296
211517,5,6300147967,LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie.  It truly is what religion should be all about.  Well done! Belissimo !  I highly recommend it.,1378166400,,122,4.454545454545454
211518,5,6300147967,"What a splendid film this is, for believers and skeptics, for churched and the unchurched. Without spoiling the story, I'll just say that when the Pope (deftly portrayed by the irresistible, hunky Tom Conti) escapes his confinement and enters, incognito, the lives of his parishioners, truly wonderful things happen. A thoroughly enjoyable film that works regardless of how the viewer feels about organized religion.

211523,5,6300147967,"I  have  little  to add it is a  wonderful  film--Graham Greene-- wrote  a meditation  called ""The Last Pope""  In which the Pope is  such a man as Tom Conti plays,  Happily  this film  does not inhabit  ""GreenLand"" still,  this film like  Greene's  little meditation points to  what the Pope  should be; the  servant of  servant of  God.  Oh  I think  folks  who  are non believers or of  different confessions will like it--it has great  sweetness",1372377600,,448,4.613333333333333
211524,4,6300147967,"I really like to watch Tom Conti in movies, one of my favorites being Shirley Valentine when he played the Greek love interest opposite Pauline Collins.  But never mind, in this movie he is the youngish Pope Leo XIV.  The story is that the pope is feeling detached from the rest of the world and during an audience comes into contact with a young deaf girl from a small village that is without a priest.  She asks the pope to send them one and he agrees.

By a sheer accident of fate, while Pope Leo is doing some gardening in old clothes he accidentally gets locked out of his home in Vatican City.  He has no money but for once he feels free as he gets tossed in the Trevi Fountain after a successful football game. After all, these Italians love their game and know how to celebrate. After finding his way to the small village of the young girl, he discovers more than just a missing priest, and this is where the story really starts to take place.

While a lot of this plot seems unbelievable, there really is a message underneath all of this.  During his stay in the village, Pope Leo strives to discover what it is that he is really meant to do.  What it boils down to is instilling motivation and hope into a group of people who have lost their way.  Not only has the village become dilapidated and run down, there is an old aquaduct that no longer functions and no one seems motivated to remedy that.  Some of the reasons come in the guise of a group of ruffians who seize control of the villagers.  How can the people stand up to such bullies?  For one, you must believe in yourself and have faith.  Everyone is tested, including the Pope.

There are a lot of funny moments in this film.  I loved the one scene where a member of the curia says, ""The Vatican Bank needs more investors,"" and describes ways to do this.  The Pope replies ""And what should we give to the most wealthy investors?""  ""Sainthood?""",1371686400,3,1914,4.331460674157303
211525,5,6300147967,"I ordered it because it reminds me of the simple style of our wonderful new Pope Francis! How lucky we are to have him at this time of sorrow, hurt and hard life styles.

I've told so many people about this movie.  Tom Conti plays a young Cardinal who is elected Pope.  He feels so unworthy to be Pope and has difficulty accepting the luxuries of the Pope's life.  He escapes the Vatican and goes to a poor village where no one recognizes him.  He helps these people build a water supply to their village. Conti is so great in this movie.  His character is so warm, humble, and funny.  This is definitely a feel good movie with a point.",1368835200,3,618,4.2956521739130435

After a 25 year stretch in which this film was only available in VCR format, we were grateful that Amazon offered the film via a made-to-order DVD format.  The quality is excellent; however, the product does not include the ""extras"" that have become standard on today's DVD or Blu-ray.

The film's plot is a gentle message about unconditional love, self-doubt and restored hope.  Conti does an excellent job of portraying a man who is a ""seeker"" like many of us - and in his search for some semblance of meaning, he encounters an out-of-the-way rural village whose residents are in need of his inspiration as much as he is in need of their affirmation.

Romantic, sentimental - and yes, a bit schmaltzy - but an ensemble cast of actors who tell a great story!",1368662400,3,830,4.696551724137931

Tom Conti does a great job of conveying the humanity of a newly-elected Pope dealing with the frustrations of his office and longing for renewed contact with his people.  His serendipitous reunification with them produces some scenes that not only give us pause for reflection on how we might deal with similar situations, but hope that good, in the end, will triumph over evil.

SINCE THEY DIDN'T HOTLINK TO PURCHASE THE DVD(R)IT CAN BE FOUND HERE: 'http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Grace-Tom-Conti/dp/B007HCI4H0'. PLEASE ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have just spoken with the MGM 'Home/Video'(owns the DVD rights only) spokesperson 'Kim' who stated that this is now on the MGM Classics DVD list to be released. (Many Thanks to Kim for the info) Apparently MGM and other studios are using Amazon's service 'CreateSpace.'
I've managed to find the following info associated with it:
'DVD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com.' AND, 'Important Note: This film has been manufactured from the best-quality video master currently available and has not been remastered or restored specifically for this DVD release.' I used the MGM Classic film 'Cold Turkey' that has been released in this same way from Amazon for those quotes so see it for yourself.
Well, this is still great news for us all to finally have a decent quality DVD release so keep checking back on Amazon for its release. In the meantime, 'Have You Seen The Pope Lately?",1287532800,8,1227,5.424083769633508

It's appeal is not an overly sentimental presentation of the ""old god becomes human theme."" Instead it takes a man who happens to be pope and allows him to temporarily abandon the vestments of his position. The central character has all the flaws of any man and makes mistakes that in some instances result in trajedy. Tom Conti's performance is outstanding. His character is both passionate and sensitive but like the rest of us struggles to make the right decisions and take the best action. The results are not predictable. You will laugh and cry but above all else it will challenge your views of what constitutes good and evil. And in the end...(I'll let you decide).",1230076800,,797,4.782608695652174

211717,5,6300147967,"This is a sweet fable.  That such an important personage as the Pope could become emeshed (incognito) in the lives of ordinary village people is a romantic notion, and yet it works, as we see this Pope reluctant to abandon his new friends and concerns while his staff in Rome struggles to put a face on his absence from the Vatican.  The Pope has gone AWOL!  And yet he is more of a Pope than any of his predecessors.  He teaches, guides, and loves his people, even reawakening faith in a lapsed priest, and rids the village of its villain.  Tom Conti as the Pontif is a lovely, lovely man.  That voice!  Please watch this.  And Please, would somebody produce the DVD???.

211718,5,6300147967,"A friend recommended this to me years ago, and when I saw the video, I loved it. Later my wife bought the VHS for me, but I hope that it will be released on DVD one day.

Although listed as a comedy--and it does have a strong humorous flavor throughout--it is a powerful drama about spiritual growth, hope, despair, love, and self respect. Reminiscent somewhat of ""Shoes of the Fisherman,"" starring Anthony Quinn, from several years earlier, this is the story of a Pope's returning to his roots of being a pastor and helper of mankind--something he found difficult, if not impossible, to do in the Vatican. Somewhat by accident, he embarked on a spiritual journey and once again proved that he was a true priest of God.

If you haven't seen this movie, please do so. It is somewhat of a ""sleeper"" and may be difficult to find. Quite frankly, I don't know why it didn't get more visibility.",1188000000,,889,4.55
211719,5,6300147967,"I remember seeing the preview to this movie when it was released in the theaters, and thinking, ""Sounds Funny!"" Well, we may have been a little mislead by that. However, this movie shows what we all must go through at one time in our lives: Self-Realization. As the Pope, is Leo really doing God's work? As a figurehead, maybe. But that's not why he became a priest. His lack of opportunity to help others, and the guilt that it brings to him is sparked by a small girl from a remote town who comes all the way to Rome to tell him that her town has no priest. His heart aches, and when he finds himself locked out of the Vatican and dressed pretty much like a bum, his impulse is to find this town and see how life can be infused back into it. Along the way, he meets bullies, theives, and love. This movie could have gotten ugly, and we could have seen the Pope in bed with a beautiful young woman, whom he understandably finds very attractive. Instead, we see a morality tale, where he won't be stopped from helping these people when they don't want to help themselves. He suffers a tremendous loss when a boy from the village is mudered, but through his death, the town once again comes alive. They do in fact have a priest in their town, and with Leo's help, he finds God again. There are plenty of smiles in this movie, but I am more touched by the story of a man who truly wants to help his fellow man. I know this is a little known show. Too bad. There are so many good lessons to be learned. But as is has no wild sex scenes, or guns blasting, most people aren't interested. I wish there were more shows like this one. After watching it, you feel like even you may make a contribution to someone's life that will change it forever, just like Leo did.",1184976000,2,1758,4.2195845697329375
211720,5,6300147967,"This film is not just a must see, it is a must own.  You will definitely want to bring out this film over and over to see again.  From its creative, unique plot, funny lines, irony, beautiful scenery, marvelous acting, and wonderful, not just feel-good but make-you-think message,  you will want to add this movie to your favorites list.

Saving Grace delights, inspires and gently admonishes the viewer to find and be faithful to the things in life that really matter, despite the naysayers and obstacles that mount up to try to obscure the simple good all around us.  This film is the opposite of in-your-face religion; instead it is about all of us finding the love and goodness in the rough and simple places all about us, rather than in the high places.

When I stumbled onto this movie some years back in a video store, the film quickly became a favorite, that I regularly showed to family and friends, and to youth groups.  All loved it, both the guys and the girls.

I would always bring it out Saving Grace to view when I became overwhelmed or beaten around by life.  To my great remorse, my VHS copy was lost when I loaned it out and never got it back.  That was several years ago.

Now I am on this site looking for a copy on DVD to buy, and grumbling because it doesn't seem to be available.  Once I find the DVD version, I will purchase at least 5 copies,for myself and to give as gifts to family and friends.  I hope the powers that be come to their senses and make this beautiful film available on DVD.

211724,5,6300147967,"Tom Conti's ""Saving Grace"" is a largely unknown, underrated movie, perhaps because it was made abroad and most of the casts were unknown actors (save Tom and a young Edward James Olmos). However, the plot of the movie and the story line was excellent.

It tells the story of a future Pope Leo XIV (played by Conti), who was isolated from his flocks, living in Vatican and surrounded by Vatican bureaucrats he had to deal with everyday. He wished that he is able to travel outside to see how his people live their lives and deal with real-life problems. One day, somewhat unexpectedly, he got his wish. He accidentally got locked out from the Vatican and decided to travel to a rural and impoverished Italian village that suffered from all the disasters and misfortune one can imagine (epidemic, unemployment, chronic poverty, failing infrastructure, etc). He decided to attempt to rekindle the spirit of the local people by (at first) single-handedly rebuild an old malfunctioning village aquaduct. Soon, he started to win followers from the young hopeless residents of the village, but he also encounters many obstacles and learnt a great deal about himself and how his ministry supposed to be like during his time in the village. This experience transforms the way he conducts his Petrine ministry in many ways.

This is a must see movie for Catholics (or anyone for that matter) that often thought that the Pope, the bishops, and the clergymen were often out-of-touch with the concerns and problems of lay Catholics. I wish the experiences of Leo XIV could happen more often in real life and transform the way Popes and bishops govern the Church. But till then, you should watch this movie, enjoy it, and pray that the transformation told in it would occur in our Church today.",1150934400,4,1780,4.871287128712871
211745,5,6300147967,"I saw this movie about 15 years ago, and I've been thinking about it ever since.

The plot, in a nutshell:  the Pope gets locked out of the Vatican, and is not recognized when he tries to get back in, leaving him free and forced to wander Italy incognito.  He stumbles into a poor village and is soon enmeshed in the lives of the struggling inhabitants, and struggles with his own crisis of faith.

The movie is very well done; well acted, well paced, visually appealing.  The story line is broadly appreciated.  My 80 year old, poorly educated Italian-immigrant grandmother laughed out loud, and chuckled about it for days afterwards.  My university professor non-religious father-in-law appreciated it almost as much.

It is truly a tragedy that this movie isn't widely available.",1128988800,9,782,4.916030534351145

The Giannini character says God doesn't exist but he hopes that's not true. The movie makes you believe that, if God does exist, it would be a wonderful thing. And maybe God does exist.

But it's not a religious movie, it's a movie about people and a movie that's wonderfully done . . ""Full of wonder"" . . hmm.",1107993600,7,524,4.127450980392157
211749,5,6300147967,"I think this is the most underrated movie I know of. And I frankly don't understand why it's not a major hit readily available on DVD. It's very well directed and cast -- I especially like Giancarlo Giannini (sp?), but Conti and Olmos and others were great too. However, the real power of the movie derives from the quality of Celia Gittelson's story. It's intelligent, warm-hearted, deep, and very funny. I watch it on sad evenings before I fall off to sleep, and life's not so bad.

I can't help using this as a forum to explain what I see in the movie.

The Pope grows heavy from being an abstraction -- longs to return to the life of a priest where he can do some concrete good for concrete people. And suddenly he finds himself with an opportunity to wander in the world incognito.

This of course leaves room for all kinds of hysterical lines by people who don't know who he is (""You can go straight to hell. Who do you think you are?"" or ""Maybe he's a priest?"" ""Naw, a priest would tell us we go to hell for this.""), and how his friends at the Vatican try to cover for him (""You got a job?... With all due respect, your Holiness, can't these villagers sort their own rags?"")

And there's one concrete thing that he wants to do. He -- the most significant -- is guided to it, by one of the most insignificant a deaf girl from a small village (Isabella) who has taken the step of leaving her home to find him... and this act somehow demands that he respond.

It's the story of how the Christ figure (who I regard as our own true self) comes to earth and lives among us; how he works; what doubts, fears and confusions he has; what matters to him; what effect he has on various types of people. It's an explanation of the mechanism whereby mankind is redeemed.

The mechanism is to go to a place where people are defeated, take on some arbitrary project which represents a positive step, and simply act. The extent to which you know what you're doing is irrelevant. What matters is the intention.

The Pope chooses in this defeated village to rebuild the aqueduct. He knows nothing about construction. And as none of the important people -- the adult males -- will help, he gets his help from those whom society deems insignificant -- orphaned children, widows.

And then you see the incredibly venomous and destructive reaction which his actions evoke in the negative forces in the society. They begin by burning the partially reconstructed aqueduct. At this point Isabella's beautiful, sane and soulful mother -- with whom he is falling in love -- asks him, ""So what are you going to do?"" ""I'll build it again."" ""He'll just burn it again."" ""So I'll build it again. And when he comes back, I'll be here. I'll be waiting for him.""

It maybe sounds stupid, but on several occasions in life, I've felt defeated -- my actions seem to be in a void, no one notices -- and this movie somehow helps me to get off my duff and 'rebuild the aqueduct'... restore my faith that my intention is heard somewhere in the ether, even if I can't see the results.

I find myself these days also relating the film to world politics. It's an essentially European film, and it restores my faith somehow that despite all their criticism of the US these days, Europe does understand the mechanism of nihilism and restoration. Europe too is on some level understandably defeated. And for all her doubts and failings, I believe the US is a positive force in the world...

The second attempt to burn is headed off by his band of ophaned boys whose allegiance the Pope has usurped from the main bad guy (Olmos). In the third burning, the incredibly charming leader of the gang is killed. He's the sacrificial lamb which spreads the Pope's intentions among the community as a whole. The Pope now feels defeated, but the community fills in.

And then there's the one town drunk, Abalardi, who lives on the outskirts, tends sheep, and is the only one who recognizes the Pope for who he really is. (""Please excuse the sheep. They see so few Popes... They fired you or what?"" ""No, I hadn't thought of that. No, they didn't fire me. Maybe God did..."" ""I can put your mind to rest on that... there's no such person."") Abalardi has the best role, and it's acted perfectly. At last the Pope asks, ""Who are you, Abelardi?"" I can keep a secret.",1093564800,96,4309,4.47515923566879
