8653500,5,B00JRB01IY,"We absolutely loved the Ultimate Pet Party Collection we received as NCircle Entertainment NSiders.  It is different from any other children's DVD we own.  Filled with real life action of live animals, my kids were glued to this movie.  I loved the fact that they learned little tidbits of information while watching too.  They loved seeing all the cute animals and have been asking for a new pet since watching!  The fact that 4 DVD's, with a variety of animals, are included for one low price makes this a great movie for any child or family.  We can not say enough good things about the Ultimate Pet Party Collection!  Our four kids range from 2 years old up to 9 and each one enjoyed this set.",1410566400,,697,4.484126984126984
8653501,5,B00JRB01IY,"We have children ranging from ages 2 years to 8 years old and these DVD's were well loved by all of them! I am always excited to find a DVD (or set of DVD's in this case!) that all our children can enjoy. Our 2 year old loved watching all the animals, and since most kids love animals she quickly fell in love with this great set of DVD's. The simple fact that these videos contain many of the common pets/animals such as puppies, kittens, horses, etc., made it even more interesting for the younger children. The older kids were more captivated by the facts and the educational aspects of the DVD's. They love picking up all sorts of little tidbits of information, and these DVD's made learning fun and exciting! It's a great way to both provide some quality entertainment for your children and to also have them learning about certain animals as well! The Ultimate Pet Party Collection is great for little animals lovers and as I mentioned above, probably my favorite features include that it entertains a variety of age groups at once, and it does a great job of mixing fun and education!

8653502,4,B00JRB01IY,"The Ultimate Pet Party Collection is a 4 DVD set containing over 4 hours of animal antics! If you have an animal lover in your home, these DVDs will surely entertain. This set includes Kitten Party, Puppy Party, Pet Party and Animal Atlas' Fun on the Farm. Various types of cats are introduced in Kitten Party, but for the majority of the running time the viewer gets to watch these furry felines frolic and play. Puppy Party introduces us to a wide array of different dog breeds, and there is lots of playful puppy fun we get to witness throughout. Pet Party is a fun overview of the domesticated animals that we call our friends, from hamsters to birds to fish, there is something for everyone. This DVD also has a ""Who Am I?"" game in the bonus features. These discs contain lots of factual tidbits that teach kids about the interesting creatures we encounter. My almost 3 year old really enjoyed watching all the critters featured on these DVDs. The Animal Atlas ""Fun on the Farm"" disc brought everyone's attention to the television screen. My 6 and 7 year old boys found this DVD most intriguing because there seemed to be more of an educational focus. We learn about where some of these animals originated from, about common traits shared by the domesticated and wild species, and we are even given some fun trivia questions as an added challenge. If your little ones are interested in animal science or just enjoy watching cute and cuddly creatures, then you will want to add this DVD set to your collection!
