3588357,5,B001FRNB62,"Hey-
Let me add my voice to those approving of this set. Great stories, great guest stars, top-notch writing that is adult and production values that are first-rate. I recently reviewed ""The Deputy"", and what a pleasant contrast this set is. Calhoun is outstanding as Bill Longley. Only Chuck Connors as The Rifleman or Hugh O'Brien as Wyatt Earp are comparable in western roles on TV.  By all means, buy this set before it goes out-of-print. Now, how about a Bat Masterson set?",1234310400,4,478,4.759036144578313
3588358,5,B001FRNB62,"I've been waiting for The Texan to be released in a viewable format for many years, & this DVD set is just what I was hoping for. The show is fairly well-produced, outdoor locations are used for about 80% of the scenes. The theme music is one of my three favorite Western theme songs: it's mysterious yet exciting, especially the part played over the end credits. Rory Calhoun is a very good actor, & he's supported by many well-known character players of the time. The Texan is a tough show, there's typically even more violence here than Shotgun Slade, which was known for its violent content. The basic premise of the show is simple & straight-forward: Everyone knows Bill Longley, he's The Texan, the fastest gun in the West. But despite that knowledge, someone always provokes him into a gunfight & is killed in the process. Nothing fancy here, just a pure, unadulterated Western, served up 1950s style. Highly Recommended!",1234137600,6,928,4.80625
3588359,4,B001FRNB62,"I have watched thirty-five episodes (5 discs) thus far of this set. I normally won't do a review until I've watched the complete set but 10 discs with 70 episodes is a lot of viewing. What I have seen thus far has not been disappointing. I can't help but make a comparison to Timeless Media Group's release of The Deputy several months previously, that set was a debacle, the quality was not very good. So, it was with trepidation when I decided to purchase this set. The quality of The Texan is extremely good, oh, there's a flaw here & there but nothing I've seen thus far has detracted from my enjoyment of it. It's not quite on the level of a major studio or network release but it's still very good.

Rory Calhoun stars as The Texan, Bill Longley. There was a gunfighter of some renown by the same name in the West, he was from Texas but not the nice guy portrayed in this series. There was no other supporting cast; it's Rory Calhoun only. He was also a co-executive producer so he had his own money sunk into this.

I fondly remember the series from the late fifties & early sixties but I didn't remember any particular episode. Honestly, I don't remember seeing this series anywhere on television for more than 40 years. It's been my experience in recent years with so many old television series released on DVD that these 30 minute dramatic & western series usually feel rushed, that is, a lot of  shortcuts were done in the script in order to keep it within the 30 minute framework. I'm not saying things were done sloppily, though sometimes they were, but that the time frame didn't allow much character development nor story development. In most cases I haven't felt that way about the 35 episodes I have watched. For the most part they were quality scripts & well done.

Surprisingly, I saw Louis L'Amour involved in two of the stories. The first he got story credit & the second he got screenplay credit. The second one (can't remember the episode's title) actually had the character, Chick Bowdrie, which L'Amour had written many short stories about. I just thought it unique that L'Amour would include one of his characters in an episode. At the end of the episode Bowdrie declares to The Texan he's going to become a marshall because of what Bill Longley had done.

They were plenty of ""name"" guest stars though few of major prominence in the episodes. They include: Neville Brand, Harry Dean Stanton, Mike Connors (Mannix), Michael Landon (Bonanza), Alan Hale, Jr., Jack Elam, Ellen Corby, Brian Donlevy (he was a major), Lon Chaney, Jr., Cesae Romero, Dorothy Provine, Denver Pyle & Strother MArtin. These are in just the first 35 episodes, some more than once.

There are eight missing episodes & I've yet to hear why they weren't included in this set. There isn't any bonus materials, not even subtitles. You can get this set for a good price if you shop around so do so. Fans of the old fifties television Westerns should get this.

I finally have completed viewing the entire set. In the final 35 episodes I saw two episodes that weren't in as good of shape as the rest. They weren't unwatchable so that's okay. Rory Calhoun even wrote one episode; it was a theme that's been done many times. Longley befriends a down-and-out man & is talked into teaching him how to become a fast draw but ends up turning on the Texan. Calhoun really did a fine performance proving he could act.
Season two of The Texan had a change in its approach: The Texan wasn't as much of a drifter & held several jobs, much like in the series Cheyenne. There's an extended string of episodes involving the same supporting cast. The longest string has Longley working with a railroad construction company. He also is hired as a trail boss on a cattle drive. In at least two or three episodes he's working for the governor of Texas as an undercover man. There's even one episode that appears to be an near exact duplicate of an episode that was done earlier in the set.

Apparently there were 37 episodes for season 1 & 41 episodes for season 2 though this doesn't seem right. From an online source it appears that these episodes are in order of broadcast but this doesn't seem quite right either. The string of episodes that involves the railroad construction are broken up by an episode or two between that particular extended story line.

Missing episodes: Season 1, episode 10 ""Desert Passage""
  Season 1, episode 22 ""The Eyes of Captain Wylie""
  Season 2, episode  3 ""Cattle Drive""
  Season 2, episode 10 ""The Reluctant Bridegroom""
  Season 2, episode 16 ""Rough Track to Payday""
  Season 2, episode 26 ""Borrowed Time""
  Season 2, episode 31 ""Ruthless Woman""

In The Texan, Calhoun played Bill Longley, an American Civil War veteran from Texas who roams the West helping people in need --- Often the plot would center around Longley helping an old friend or a relative of an old friend --- He was known by name and reputation as a fearsome gunfighter, and his reputation both saved time and caused him trouble --- Longley a level headed ""cowboy"" always on the move --- He never looked for trouble but it usually found him --- Trouble may have found him but he was so fast with a gun that it never stuck around.

The Texan ran for only two seasons -- After the 79-episode run --- Calhoun co-produced The Texan in partnership with Desilu Productions, the production company founded by Lucille Ball and her first husband, Desi Arnaz, Sr. --- Calhoun returned to starring and co-starring in ""B"" Westerns, and making occasional television appearances --- In Calhoun's later years, he starred in several B-Westerns --- He also found success as a screenwriter, producer, director, and rancher.

After the The Texan was canceled, he continued to appear in both television and film throughout the 1970s and 1980s including; Rawhide, Gilligan's Island, Hawaii Five-O, Alias Smith and Jones, Starsky and Hutch, and Motel Hell --- In 1982 Calhoun had a regular role on the soap opera Capitol --- He stayed with the series until 1987 --- His final role was that of grizzled family patriarch and rancher Ernest Tucker in the 1992 film ""Pure Country""

Every episode is uncut and unedited and the best superior picture quality from the original 35mm nitrate negatives. In other words, you will not find better anywhere else.

The guests include Neville Brand, a young Michael Landon, Andy Clyde, James Drury and many others. If you hesitate because people often are too critical (champagne taste and a beer budget wallet) take my word for it as a guy who is picky about his DVDs.

3588365,4,B001FRNB62,"""The Texan- The Best Of"" is a release by Timeless Media Group of 70 of the 78 episodes of this Western television series starring popular Western movie actor Rory Calhoun. In ""The Texan,"" Calhoun played Bill Longley, a ex-Confederate soldier who came home after the Civil War to find his plantation burned down and his wife dead. He then began to roam the West, using his considerable gunfighter skills to help old friends or new friends in trouble.

It is a shame that eight of the episodes of this series were not found or were incomplete so that the complete series could not be released. This was a very entertaining TV series. Calhoun's charm, plus his many years of experience appearing in Western films, made ""The Texan"" interesting and engaging. Like the best Western heroes, Calhoun could play serious and comic scenes with equal aplomb, and made Longley a believable and enjoyable hero.

One can only hope that the other eight episodes of the series will be found and be usable in a future release.",1221955200,27,1008,4.7542857142857144

3588371,4,B001FRNB62,"The Texan was a well-scripted western series that ran for two seasons (1959-1960).  The original episodes, of which there were actually78, not 70, were filmed in 35mm, full screen, black and white, and presented in Dolby Mono in this offering.  Being a no-frills item, you have the choice of playing all the episodes on a disc at once, or choosing them individually.  There are no chapter/scene pauses an no bonus material.

Rory Calhoun played the feature character,  Bill Longley, and was also a co-producer of the series. He performances were augmented by a veritable treasure trove of character actors and future stars. The episodes are not presented sequentially, they are not numbered (and there are no runtimes). I they were, the Purchaser would realize that the following episodes were not included:
S1 E10:  Desert Passage
S1, E22: The Eyes of Captain Wylie
S2, E3:  Cattle Drive
S2, E 10:  The Reluctant Bridegroom
S2, E16:  Rough Track to Payday
S2, E 26:  Borrowed Time
S2, E31:  The Rustlers Woman
S2, E36:  The Mountain Man

The packaging is a wide clam-shell, with 4 spindles that hold 8 discs and a spot for the remaining two discs on the inside of the front and back covers.  The graphics are good, but the design is misleading. The front and spine of the box say ""The Complete Series"" and the back indicates that there 70 episodes (again, there are actually 78).  There was some minor damage to the cover and spine art, but not bad enough to return the set. One disc hand minor scratches that did not affect playback (it was loose inside the back cover and was flopping around inside when I opened the box).

The transfers were clear, although a few imperfections that apparently couldn't be corrected were present. Again, not enough to make the set returnable. Each episode's greyscale gradation was consistent (some episodes were lighter than others, mostly likely due to the condition of the strips they were transferred from): all were clear and crisp.  The intro to each episode appears to have been copied from the same source and is lighter than some of  the episodes it is attached to. The audio is very clear and crisp and sound level was good throughout.

If you are fan of The Texan, wax nostalgic for oaters with good story lines, and don't mind a bunch of missing episodes, this is a still a good investment for the price. Would love to given  it a 5, but 4 is not bad either.",1503792000,10,2407,4.685714285714286

3588378,4,B001FRNB62,"Back in the late 50s and early 60s, a crowd of television westerns dominated the TV airwaves, and Rory Calhoun, a movie matinee idol starred in and produced this series, which had a 2 year run on CBS, often co-starring many frequent famous guest stars, such as Alan Hale Jr, James Coburn, Jack Elam, Denver Pyle, Mike Conners, Harry Dean Stanton, among others.

My top 12 TV westerns of this period are :

1  Gunsmoke with James Arness and Dennis Weaver
2- Bonanza with Lorne Greene, Michael Landon, Pernell Roberts and Dan Blocker
3  The Rifleman with Chuck Connors
4  Walt Disneys Zorro with Guy Williams
5  Daniel Boone ( and Davy Crockett) with Fess Parker
6  The Big Valley with Barbara Stanwick, Richard Long, Lee Majors and Linda Evans
7  The Virginian with Lee J Cobb, James Drury, Doug McClure and Roberta Peters
8  Wanted Dead Or Alive with Steve McQueen
9 - Have Gun Will Travel with Richard Boone
10  The Rebel with Nick Adams
11  Rawhide with Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood
12 Wyatt Earp with Hugh O Brien

And then there were the other westerns. Mostly B-type , that include Wagon Train, Cheyenne, Gene Autry Show, Bronco, Laramie, Cimarron Strip, The Lawman, Sugarfoot, The Dakotas, Zane Grey Theatre, Death Valley Days and Rin Tin Tin (not on DVD), among others. The Texan falls into this second group, an interesting series with 7 episodes each on 10 discs, I never really saw this show on TV when it first aired, so its another nice western series to add to my collection.

The only  slight problem I have is with the inconsistency of the picture quality in this set, either the episodes have vibrant black/white sharpness ( 8/10) or they are more on the greyish/white quality ( 6.5/10).

3588414,4,B001FRNB62,"Somehow or other I missed watching this half-hour BW Western when it was first on TV, so buying this box set was somewhat in the nature of a gamble.  Rory Calhoun was a surprisingly versatile actor who seems all but forgotten today--not conventionally handsome, but he profits from a tall, lean build and glossy black hair in a natural widow's peak.  As Bill Longley (the actual name of a vicious and ruthless gunslinger of the Old West), he drifts from Arizona to Montana, distinctively clad in black and white and companied only by a beautiful piefaced black-and-white overo pinto, and comes to be known as ""the Texan.""  Though it's widely known that ""his gun's not for hire""--many lawmen are friends of his, and others know and respect his reputation--he lives by doing deputy work, shotgun guarding on stages, bossing trail herds, troubleshooting for express companies, guiding wild-horse hunters, and serving as second-in-command on a telegraph-stringing crew and troubleshooter/assistant project engineer on a railroad track crew.  He ferrets out the truth of murders and robberies, finds and helps a nine-year-old boy traumatized to muteness by his father's murder, takes the part of a beleaguered Mexican attempting to establish a peach orchard and a bullied Hungarian peddler, kills a man in self-defense and discovers that the law obligates him to support the victim's widow and her children until she remarries (and that the very attractive widow--who's also the sheriff's daughter--has eyes for him), poses as a preacher to break the hold of a ring of bad guys on a town, tracks down a man inexplicably pretending to be him, has a reunion with two old friends from the Confederacy one of whom is married to the other's former fiancee, heads up a fractious posse whose members decide they'd rather split the recovered loot than return it, unwittingly walks into the middle of a feud between an outlaw and a retired lawman, and has many other adventures, some unique in my experience of Westerns.

Distractingly, the dating of the series is all over the map: at various times we see a check dated 1872, a headstone 1871, and a poster 1873, hear references to ""five years after Appomattox"" (1870) and to the deaths of Wild Bill Hickok (1876), Sam Bass (1878), Billy the Kid (1881), Ben Thompson and King Fisher (1884), and find Bill working with a railroader who speaks of going on to build a line across the Dakotas (1873) and bossing ""the first herd"" from Texas to Denver (probably c. 1859-60).  (Of course, the writers--who include Frank Gruber, Louis L'Amour, Samuel A. Peeples (a.k.a. novelist Brad Ward), Irving Wallace, and Calhoun himself (who also co-produced the series)--may simply be randomly selecting incidents from a long career.)  Guest stars include such stalwarts of the era as Michael Dante, Alan Hale Jr. (who appears no less than five times), James Drury, William Schallert, Morgan Woodward, Paul Fix, Andy Clyde (twice), Ray Teal, Michael Pate (twice), Ellen Corby, Paul Brinegar, Ralph Moody, Douglas V. Fowley (amazingly young, or at worst middle-aged), R. G. Armstrong, Trevor Bardette, Stuart Randall (who makes no less than three appearances as three different sheriffs!), Charles Gray, Peter Whitney, Robert J. Wilkie (a four-timer), John Doucette, Myron Healy (three times), Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez (twice), perpetual Indian Frank deKova, Anthony Caruso, B-Western legend Bob Steele (as gunfighter Luke Short, whom Longley kills--the real one didn't), John Dehner, James Coburn, Malcolm Atterbury, Jack Elam (three times), Denver Pyle, Brian Donlevy, Cesar Romero, Dorothy Provine, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand, Strother Martin, and a very young Michael Landon.  It's worth noting that some of the episodes seem to be recorded out of sequence: ""Trouble on the Trail,"" on Disc 7, should be watched before ""Showdown at Abilene"" (both are elements of one of two three-part series); ""End of the Track,"" also on Disc 7, actually belongs with ""Buried Treasure"" (Disc 8), ""Captive Crew"" (ditto), and ""Showdown"" (Disc 9), all of which, in approximately that order, comprise the railroad-building arc.  I also found, disappointingly, that each of the ten discs in my particular set had a rather bad flaw in exactly the same place, a problem I hope the company will be willing to rectify (Timeless Media does occasionally have difficulties with its pressings, but is usually very decent about making good).  (Be sure you buy this ten-disc set rather than the two-disc tin if you're interested in getting anything like the full series, though there are still 10 segments left out.)",1295568000,3,4609,5.149732620320855

3588416,3,B001FRNB62,"I'll be murdered for this but I got sucked into purchasing this set based on the over the top praising of the brilliant picture quality. I'm guessing these reviewers are comparing this to bootleged video or other some sort of 3rd generation videos because frankly the image quality is mediocre with some exceptions. the first disc has two SOLID episodes with actual blacks and whites...which are "" The Man with the solid Gold Star"" and ""Jail for the Innocents""...the other 5 are lacking in contrast.  What that means is they don't have any SNAP or pop....a lot of gray but no real strong black or brilliant white...they are FLAT.

If you are a fan of the series I'm sure you'll be happy to have at least this workable version but to compare this to say ""RAWHIDE"" or even ""CHEYENNE"" for picture quality would be ridiculous and even the Lone Ranger set from several years earlier puts this to shame in picture quality.  The second disc opens more promising with the first few episodes showing the contrast one would expect from original negatives and living up to the praises of the other reviews..but alas...episodes with flat contrast and no snap also begin appearing half way through this batch of 7.

by the way...I bounced clear out to disc 7 to catch a favorite of mine James Coburn in a guest role but alas its another of the muddy washed out flat episodes.

As far as the series....and acting and story lines...I did not view it when it aired so I don't have nostalgia attached but I found it only okay....not in the league of Rawhide, Cheyenne, or Gunsmoke by any means..or Maverick.

Buyer be ware....rose colored glasses are being worn by the overly excited reviewers here when it comes to picture quality anyway.",1261353600,12,1722,4.685430463576159

3588426,4,B001FRNB62,"Finally finished viewing the entire 70 episode collection. Calhoun gives a good performance as the lead character throughout, and Timeless Media did an adequate job in assembling the collection. Wonderful theme music and atmospheric settings.

However, I was astonished at how badly the series deteriorated during the second season, and I cannot explain what the cause of the problem was. Somebody either gave up on maintaining the quality of the series and lost interest or the money supply dried up. This is hard to understand, as Desilu helped to co-produce the series, and usually put out a quality product.

First off the second season was marred by by two endless storylines. The first involved a cattle drive, probably inspired by the popularity of Rawhide. Way too many fakey scenes filmed indoors on phony horses, instead of realisitic on location shooting.

The second boring storyline took place at a railroad spur construction site. This seemed to go on for 5 or 6 episodes, and was a chore to sit through.

What really annoyed me about the second season was that many of the episodes are stuffed with stock footage from the first season. The last episode on the collection is virtually an entire reprint of an earlier episode with a few new scenes thrown in for good measure. Some of this nonsense is hilarious. In one of the episodes Longley in appointed deputy marshall and given a badge. As he races through the canyons tracking down some gunman, scenes from the first season are spliced into the episode. So in one scene Longley has a badge on his vest, in the next the badge vanishes, only to reappear in the next scene.

It is sad that the program disintegrated as badly as it did for the second season.

Give the first season an A, the second season a D.
