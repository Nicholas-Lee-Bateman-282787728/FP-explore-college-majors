8445278,5,B004WLP4NQ,"I enjoy watching this series! It shows a family who loves God and are raising their children in a loving; Christian home. People have a lot of negative things to say about this family, but why? What have they done that it so terrible that they get called ignorant or any other negative term that people have been calling them. Those negative comments belong to people who think that just because they are a Christian family that they are supposed to be perfect...ONLY GOD IS PERFECT! Like any other PERSON they make mistakes and have differences of opinions that they are fully entitled to. I have never once heard them say that you have to believe all the things that they believe. I have heard them clearly state-on multiple occasions- that this show is just a way of showing people how their family chooses to live. Negative people don't hear that part! Their trials were handled in the proper manner and- just like any family- they have dealt with heavy situations that are private. How many parents can control their grown son or daughter...none! Your children make mistakes and bad decisions like their son did, but you they handled it with grace and are getting through it as a family. I commend them for that. People are quick to put down the Duggars but give rave reviews to shows that glorify drama, fighting, cursing, bad behavior, addictions, violence, destruction, confusion,and negativity! If you do not like this show do not watch it...but, leave them alone! Would you like for people to judge the way you live and constantly call you names for you just living your life? I think they are handling their trials very well. They are people who are giving those who are interested in how they live insight into their lives. That's it! The only people who can judge ANYONE are people who are perfect...ARE YOU PERFECT?",1501027200,,1829,4.71875

8445281,1,B004WLP4NQ,This is a horrible show. I don't know why anyone would spend their money on this junk. It's a bunch of uneducated bigots running around and preaching bigotry and missogony.  It's heavily edited to cut out anything that hey don't like and full of fake set up scenes.  If I could give it a negative star I would.,1446336000,2,310,4.327586206896552
