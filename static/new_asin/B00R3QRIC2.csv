8693965,4,B00R3QRIC2,"The film and the print are outstanding. However, the music track is the worst I've ever heard on a silent film.",1487808000,2,111,4.333333333333333
8693966,4,B00R3QRIC2,"Like P. Muncie, I don't know what I really thought of the soundtrack of ""Variete.""  It was certainly different!  It had a certain ""cabaret"" feel to it, as if you were imagining a night club in Germany duing the 1920's.  I don't know if I liked it or didn't, but it was interesting.",1466726400,,281,4.264150943396227
8693967,5,B00R3QRIC2,"I can understand Arnold P.'s complaint about the music. I was both annoyed and fascinated by it, leaning to the ""fascinated.""  But don't hesitate to own this truly great film by waiting for another iteration to appear.",1448928000,,218,4.891891891891892
8693968,1,B00R3QRIC2,A word of warning. The accompanying music works against this wonderfully restored great silent film and totally destroys the viewing experience. I would wait for another edition with a more appropriate score.,1442275200,2,208,5.53125

8693970,4,B00R3QRIC2,"A fine melodrama about love, betrayal and murder with thrilling high wire displays and innovative camera work. I have been waiting for this to appear on DVD in an acceptable transfer for years. It also includes the bowdlerized edition prepared for the US market.

I do not understand why we were not given more than one soundtrack option, however, because the accompanying soundtrack from the Tiger Lillies with its hectoring tone (like having Joel Gray's character from CABARET offering sneering musical commentary throughout) can be very annoying. I found that turning down the sound helped; the Tiger Lillies sounded better to me sotto voce.",1437782400,4,644,5.1923076923076925
