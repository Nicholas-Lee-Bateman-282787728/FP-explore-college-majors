1811701,4,B00007J6DN,"Hard to belive that a Gerry Anderson puppet series will be released in the United States first instead of the United Kindom! Especially this series that only aired on NBC from 1963 to 1964, and short clips used on Dennis Miller's short lived talk show. Filmed in black and white, this is the point Anderson's supermarionation shows started to steer towards Outer Space themes that would be used a lot in later shows such as Thunderbirds, Captian Scarlet, UFO, Space 1999 ect. Certainly a kids show, it's still amazing to see the effects the production crew managed to pull off, it also serves as proof that with each new puppet series, the sets, effects, puppets, and stories were improving until they finally peaked with Captain Scarlet, Anderson's finest hour. I myself have only seen short clips of this rarely scene series, and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this box set, visible wires, kiddie stories and all. I wonder if A&E will do the same thing with Supercar?",1042675200,7,981,4.776470588235294

1811720,5,B00007J6DN,"Good fun for kids and adults to.  Yes, you can see the strings.  Although most American adults have lost interest in outer space, children are still interested and will enjoy the shows.

I found the extras on the DVD's to be interesting.  It featured some of the people involved the original production.

This is really good entertainment for children say, 3 to 10, and adults over 30.  It will go over the heads of most teenagers.

Highly recommended.",1408233600,,452,4.717948717948718

1811746,5,B00007J6DN,"This was one of the early Supermarionation series created by Britons Gerry & Sylvia Anderson, and one of their best.  Puppets were nothing new to television, but the Andersons explored the potential of marionettes and special effects to a whole new level.  While the stories do amount to little more than kid's stuff, they are dramas with plots and characterization, and on par with '50s ""real people"" sci-fi series like Captain Midnight, Space Patrol, and Rocky Jones.

Having watched episodes on a black and white TV as a young boy, I didn't know that the series itself was filmed in black and white, but this is not disappointing (later Supermarionation series like Thunderbirds were in color).  It's still great fun to watch the space adventures of Steve Zodiac and crew on the Fireball XL5.

Folks familiar with Team America: World Police may find it interesting just how advanced the Andersons' Supermarionation was over 50 years ago.",1395014400,,940,5.0

1811748,5,B00007J6DN,"Gerry Anderson's ""Fireball XL5"" holds up surprisingly well over 50 years after its creation (1962)!  Not as well-known as the ""Thunderbirds"" series, ""Fireball XL5"" (which came before ""Thunderbirds"") is lighter and has a bit more humor.  But it also is a surprisingly influential bit of pop-culture sci-fi, especially when it comes to ""Star Trek"" and the original ""Star Wars"" (all-metal planet, anyone?).  The recent movie send-up of this hi-tech marionette technique, ""Team America,"" employed many of the same British puppeteers that Gerry Anderson used on ""Fireball XL5"" and ""Thunderbirds.""  Really great classic television.",1377302400,,625,5.688172043010753

1811766,5,B00007J6DN,"The passing of Gerry Anderson, which occurred the day before I write this, prompts me to write this brief review now. Having already encountered Supercar on television in the early 1960s, I was thrilled to learn that a newer series was slated to be aired by NBC. In my youth I was a regular Saturday morning couch potato bud, and Fireball XL5 immediately became the favorite of my junior high years. The Andersons' production techniques had improved from Supercar, but some shortcomings were still evident. Still, the character interactions were a joy if a bit trite, and to watch the stories play out in space was a dream come true. So is the release of this comprehensive set, which I keep figuratively under lock and key. Whether for the fun or the fun plus nostalgia, I recommend it.",1356566400,,787,4.7101449275362315
1811767,5,B00007J6DN,"I love this set!  The video is crisp, the sound is great and it brings back wave after wave of nostalgia from my childhood.  Fireball XL5 was the first of the Anderson series that I ever saw; every Saturday morning!

If I have any complaint about the disk set it would be the lack of a ""Play All"" feature.  You can't just start playing the episodes and let them run, one after another.  You have to individually choose each episode to run it.  Other than that, I love it!",1356480000,,471,4.235955056179775

1811770,5,B00007J6DN,"The series: 5 star, it's great. My only disappointment is that Amazon says: Closed-captioned. Well... you can forget about it. There is nothing like that.
  Sincerely, K.",1319500800,,170,5.2592592592592595
1811771,5,B00007J6DN,"I saw Thunderbirds at a video store once and thought, ""I thought the name of the show was Fireball XL5,"" but I wasn't really sure. I watched this show when I was about 3 or 4 and I can only remember one scene, and I even thought it was in color. When I ran into it on Amazon I ordered it immediately. I'm getting some flashbacks as I watch the episodes, it used to be kind of scary. My kids were skeptical at first but they like it. I'm surprised at the very sharp image quality. Just because it is old and BW doesn't mean it is all fuzzy and poorly lit. The alien landscapes are awesome. It's a welcome analog respite from all the current digital effects.",1306368000,3,656,4.1328125
1811772,5,B00007J6DN,"Highly enjoyable, and the episodes bring back terrific memories of watching this when I was small.  The stories are simple (so far...), but imaginative, and suitable for kids.  Film quality surprisingly clean and sharp, especially for B&W TV in 1962.  Sure, Steve's a little stiff -- but he's a puppet, what do you expect?  (And just TRY to get that excellent theme song out of your head...)",1297987200,2,391,4.791044776119403
1811783,5,B00007J6DN,"THIS IS PURE FUN, FUN, FUN! And being in black & white makes it even more special. I really like the different

1811784,5,B00007J6DN,"OK..so i am a kid still at heart , but i really love this:) The quality of the shows are beautiful black and white, and strings and all just make it better , and fun to watch. I remember watching this show on saturday mornings , and i just couldn't figure out how they did it...i was 6 at the time. This again was made for kids...so ppl should not review it like it's star wars or something..just sit back , and enjoy the stories , and try to remember the carefree days of when you first saw it:)I recommend it to anybody , and there kids:)
  By the way...i know bout the ""is go"" is for thunderbirds , but it just sounded good here as well.",1295308800,3,640,4.031496062992126
1811785,5,B00007J6DN,"What a way to relive my childhood, than to watch a television show that was on every Saturday morning and running outside with my brothers and pretending to be the characters from the show!! Many memories came back as I watched each episode, smiling at the characters Zooney and Robert the Robot. It came at a good time for reminiscing!",1289952000,2,336,4.616666666666666
1811786,5,B00007J6DN,"Great- quality is great- more so when you consider that the last time I saw these was using a '60's TV using standard VHF transmission, including all of the resolution killers of the time degrading the quality of the image.
It is almost weird to see such crisp video and hear quality audio.
Thanks for putting this together- brought back a lot of memories.
My granddaughter (6) LOVES it too. We have spent many an hour watching together.
Our favorite is the Aquaphibian episode- which, as I remember, was the subject of a Monday morning discussion with the kids on the school bus when I was in High School.
Worth it's weight in gold!",1286496000,2,633,4.56140350877193
1811787,5,B00007J6DN,"Okay,  I have better things to do with my busy life than to review this product. Other than to share with others my recent observations of this creative effort and how it may have been the germination of my love of things sci-fi.
My earliest memories as  a child were sitting and watching this program with my older brother.  He was 13, I was 3.  We would watch Clutch Cargo,Sally Starr, Gene London and Fireball XL5 together.  I found the images and stories from Fireball scarey but intriquing.  I can remember seeing the images of the Fireball XL5 taking off, seperating, flying though space, and landing and importing them directly into my imagination, to be downloaded to my toys, and imaginary journeys with my rocket ships.  Everything that I could pick up and ""fly"" through space, my mind's eye viewed as a  space ship.  Later, my wife and I used to joke about these marionettes and their faulty and comical motor skills.  Many side splitting evenings we would refer to these marionette plays parroting their movable bottom lips, exagerated eye brows, and the numb motions of their hands.  When I saw this set on line,it was probably the quickest Amazon purchase decision I have made.
One weekend evening, we opened the box set together, and watched several episodes...and I can tell you, though it had been 40 some odd years since this show was aired, and when we last saw them, we both had a joyful trip down memory lane.  Who can remember the early sixties...this brought us both back.
I am an avid sci fi fan.  I read sci-fi..I am a card holding Trekker...I was first in line to see Star Wars...read and understood Dune in JR High. Fireball
XL is seminal.  It set the theme for Lost in Space...Star Trek...Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica.  Just watch the episodes....It is all the same!  It may be blasphemy to suggest that Gene Roddenbury stole some of the ideas from Fireball XL5... but the similarities are uncanny.
I have one more observation...was a connection that I had with my older brother.  He viewed these videos...and it brough him back to 1963 too.  I wonder how many connections these videos will make for you.  Buy them.  They will bring you back.",1286236800,5,2176,4.691292875989446
1811788,5,B00007J6DN,"Can't add anything more to the other great reviews.... I was born in 1954 and saw this as a kid on TV.  The theme song made me smile from ear to ear to the extent that I thought my face would break (I always thought the song was at the beginning of each episode, but it is not.... it is at the conclusion of each show).  I was amazed at the quality of the DVD's and the packaging.  This is an A&E product.  I think it was made in Britain originally.  The special features have a narrative by one of the gentlemen that did the puppet's voices.  I agree with the comment someone else offered.... as good as this is I didn't need the entire series.  After watching just a few episodes my nostalgia was more than satisfied.  Too bad they do not offer just a single DVD of episodes (but again the price is very fair for this mega set).  I highly recommend Fireball XL5.  My 7 year od grandson thinks Fireball XL5 is great too, but prefers Starwars!",1282003200,2,943,4.188888888888889
1811789,4,B00007J6DN,"Somehow when I was ten years old this was a fabulous adventure. Steve and Venus racing to board the Fireball, a dramatic lift off, the race to save the(pick it) world, solar system, universe, galaxy, etc. from the evil............(always Eastern European accents with a monobrow) bad guys. But our guys won because they have pure hearts and good intentions.........

It works four or five or ten times........and then gets boring(which surprised me, I love this sort of space opera). The quality of the B&W video is excellent and the sound quality is good considering that these were done in the early 1960s on a (literally) shoestring budget.",1279152000,,643,5.009345794392523
1811790,5,B00007J6DN,"I used to watch this program as a very young guy, today even thou it's a little corny and a very LOW tech production, by today's standards, it still was great at that time and it brings back some great memories. If you loved the show when you was little you will probably still love it! Hope this helps.",1276646400,,303,4.1525423728813555
1811791,4,B00007J6DN,"If you ever saw this show, as I did, when it was first released for the TV in black and white, you might have thought you would never see it again. It comes from that time-warp of my impressionable youth. It was broadcast in Australia a few years after release in the UK, and in time for the USA and USSR space race of the mid 60's. We had Century21 comic books and hardcover annuals to follow up.

The clarity is high in DVD format. Plenty of quaint puppet strings are visible, but the characters, dialog and stories are all I remembered. My kids started watching with me, and asked to see another episode. We will slowing go through all 39 of them. I heard one voice over episode by David Graham and it made me laugh.

If you ever remember seeing and enjoying an episode of this in your youth, you will probably enjoy this DVD set all over again. Certainly better than I remembered Captain Scarlet or Supercar, which now seem flat and bland by comparison. This is on a par with Thunderbirds.",1273708800,,993,4.3621621621621625
1811820,5,B00007J6DN,Never saw this set of Anderson shows when I was growing up but it is very interesting in that it was the only one of his that had both intro and ending music. Good but will bore the pants off of the younger generation. Specially since the science is almost non-exsistant!,1271721600,,271,4.333333333333333
1811821,4,B00007J6DN,"When people think of Gerry Anderson's ""Supermarionation"" series from the 1960's, they think first of ""Thunderbirds"", then ""Captain Scarlet"", ""Stingray"", or even the first Supermarionation series, ""Supercar"".

Few think of ""Fireball XL5"", even though it was the only Supermarionation series to be broadcast in the United States over a network (Saturday mornings on NBC from October, 1963 until September, 1965). Here in the 'States, all of the other Supermarionation shows were syndicated to individual television stations.

Perhaps because it was in black-and-white, ""XL5""'s hasn't been widely seen in reruns. And that's a shame. This is, in some respects, the most entertaining of the Supermarionation series.

I purchased this as a Christmas present for my younger brother, who was four-and-a-half when this series premiered on NBC (in fact, it's one of the first TV shows he recalls watching when it was first on the air). He loved it then, and he loves it now.

Granted, Dr. Venus occassionally got sexist treatment from the other characters (she was a Doctor of Space Medicine, but still had to fix dinner), principal villians Mr. and Mrs. Space Spy had Russian accents (this was the Cold War era, remember?), and the characters used ""oxygen pills"" instead of doning spacesuits and helmets for spacewalks (likely because it was too much of a bother to design space helmets with holes on the top for the various puppetry strings and Supermarionation wires to go through). But overall, this is a quite entertaining series.

One of the best things about ""XL5"" were the visual effects of XL5 and other spaceships taking off, in flight, and landing. These were quite elaborate for early 1960's television, and were done by Derek Meddings, who continued with Anderson through ""UFO"" and went on to do special effects for many classic movies of the 1970's, 1980's, and early 1990's. Had ""XL5"" been produced in America, the show might well have won an Emmy for best visual effects had there been an Emmy award in that category then.

Anyone who is a fan of the classic Gerry Anderson Supermarionation shows but who has never seen ""XL5"" should go out and buy this DVD set. You'll be happy you did!

By the way, the 4-star review is mine. My brother would rate ""XL5"" six stars on a scale of one star to five stars!",1262908800,4,2308,4.93298969072165

1811823,5,B00007J6DN,I fell out of my chair when I noticed Fireball XL-5 on DVD!!!  Some of my earliest and most fond Saturday morning memories are of watching this show on an old tube TV!!  Apparently I have too much free time as I managed to watch the entire collection in a few weeks.  Now I am out looking for the other two series Anderson made.,1257724800,,328,4.09375
1811824,5,B00007J6DN,"The things I remember most about this program from reruns is the music. I really loved the beginning theme and the ending theme. Other than that, the rest is a blur--except that I seem to recall that I enjoyed some of the shows because they were cool.

Enter the 21st century and the Fireball XL5 DVDs are released and I picked up the set from the subliminal memories I had of the show. I still don't remember a thing about any of the episodes but what a great surprise and fun it was to view the first DVD and get totally floored by the scripts, the production values, and the characters in this series.

Ok, the silly strings always show in the episodes, but the actors take their parts so seriously that you start to imagine that the marionettes are actually live. The shows exhibit quite a lot of sophistication in the stories as the XL5 crew visits different planets, meet up with space aliens, and interact with each other.

The ensemble cast of Steve Zodiac, Matt, and Venus form a tight bond that predates the threesome in the original Star Trek series. There are some scientific goofs in the series such as the crew going out into space without space suits (what, they breath in a vacuum?) but I suppose if they are 100 years into the future, perhaps they had a force-field around them. ;)

In any event, each episode is truly enjoyable for me and I am totally in awe with the ""special effects"" the great writing, and voice acting. I'm only up to the second DVD so far, but I'm totally looking forward to view the rest of the set.

If you want to see how it was done before CG, pick this set up and marvel (and laugh) at how it was done in the past. In any event, the character actors believed in what they were doing and this totally shows through in the episodes. Hardly a bit of camp or cheese. If it did, it would have made me a ""tootie"" for buying it. :D",1252540800,,1868,4.295454545454546

Fireball XL-5 uses many tricks, gimmicks, innovations and logic to bring the future to life.  I won't give any of the good stuff away, but in this show, you will see things that appeared in Star Trak, Star Wars, etc.

It is wonderful to relive an important part of my childhood, while at the same time, realizing that so much created for this series was borrowed by other more recent shows.  This should definitely be part of any Sci-Fi fan's collection.",1243555200,,710,4.603174603174603

I would make sure to watch the episodes each Saturday on our round-tubed RCA Victor black and white television, and wouldn't give a hoot if there were puppet wires showing, or the effects were ""cheesy"" according to the great technology of today.  My school lunchbox, and a toy that I played with until it totally fell apart were both Fireball XL5.  I had an actual model of the ship which fired plastic rockets, and included the minature hover craft and our two heroes.  The vehicle would separate into two pieces making it even more ""neato.""  When the DVD box set came out, I was totally surprised.  I had no idea that this show was even still in existence, as well as remastered into some fine memorabilia.  I made sure to add it to my collection.  The memories that it brought back were incredible, and my younger relatives have enjoyed watching such a vintage show.  My brother came to visit and as a surprise I pulled out a disc of the show, and it was like the old Saturday mornings once again.

1811833,5,B00007J6DN,"It is 2062, and the World Space Patrol, set at Space City, watches the skies with its fleet of XL spacecraft. The hero of the half hour, Colonel Steve Zodiac, is the pilot of Fireball XL5, the interplanetary rocketship protecting Sector 25 beyond the Solar System from alien invasion. With Steve Zodiac in command, his crew consisted of Venus, a doctor of space medicine, Professor Matic, the science officer, Venus's pet Zoonie the Lazoon, and Robbie the Robot, the rocket's mechanical co-pilot. I was 6 when Fireball XL5 aired and ever since I've been a SciFi and realSci fan, going on from XL5 to the likes Dr Who, Lost in space, the moon landings and a PhD in astrophysics. However despite the oddities of the witty 60's script, the spaceship Fireball XL5, and its accessories like the hover scooters, are a fantastic iconic design (particularly in the colour stills). The storylines are quite strong for a kids series, and the aliens are quite convincing - although we seem to see many of them again quite soon as the fishpeople in Stingray. In many ways Fireball XL5 is has a younger feel to it than later Anderson projects, so I expect boys nearer 5 to 7 would appreciate it most (or those now around 50 who first saw it at this age). I quickly bought this DVD set when it was going particularly cheaply on Amazon.

My son at 6 really took to the two XL5 videos I had, and like me he really really loved the Steve Zodiac song sung by Don Spencer at the end of each of episode, and we often used to have sing-alongs with it in the car. Although it was nice and thoroughly `modern' to let Venus (voiced by Sylvia Anderson) leave the nappies and washing behind and come along as part of the crew, it's not long before the good Dr of Space medicine is making the coffee or tripping over and screaming for male assistance. Typical Dr Venus quote `Oh I am a Tootie' - which I presume must be some sort of 2060's space bimbo. So Venus provides the backup for the two batchelor men, like doing the ironing, cooking, cleaning up after them, while also juggling a highly succesful career. Typical Professor Matic quote 'Now now, Venus, none of your feminine intuition. Let's stick to the facts' - I expect they had to cut what happened next.

My only regret is that the XL5 series hasn't been colourised in the same manner as the early B&W Bewitched episodes, as the XL5 spacehip would look great in colour. My son (now 9) hasn't taken to the whole XL5 series as he now can't tolerate the black and white TV - however he absolutely loves the B&W AP Films co-production `Torchy the battery boy' from 1958 so perhaps he is actually both too young and too old at 9 for this level of SciFi sophistication. What do I care I bought the series for my 50th birthday - and he's happy with Joe90 and Terrahawks in full `HudsonColour'. And even now ""I wish I was a spaceman, the fastest guy alive. We'd Fly around the universe in Fireball Xl5. Way out in space together, conquerors of the sky, My heart would be a fireball, a fireball, and you would be my Venus of the skies.""",1167782400,11,3062,4.44661921708185
1811834,5,B00007J6DN,"During the 1960s Gerry Anderson produced a series of ""high tech"" puppet shows using a series of innovations collectively named Supermarionation.  Cinematic special effects such as rear projection and travelling mattes were combined with circuitry enabling a puppet's mouth to respond to sound track cues.  The result was an amazing series of programs:  Four Feather Falls, Supercar, Fireball XL5, Thunderbirds, Captain Scarlet and Joe 90.  Each show was a quantum leap over the previous one in terms of sophistication, due largely to a remarkable gang of geniuses such as Anderson, Derek Meddings, Christine Glanville, Reg Hill and Barry Gray who stayed and evolved together for most of the decade.  Although the ""heart"" of Anderson's ouvre may be the great hour-long Thunderbird episodes, my favorite will always be Fireball XL5.

I nearly jumped out of my seat upon seeing a ten second clip in Tom Hanks' That Thing You Do.  At that moment my childhood came rushing back and I was once again in front of the TV on a Saturday morning, munching cereal and following the adventures of Steve, Matt and Venus.  On a 19 inch black and white set the strings didn't show, a papier mache ball was a convincing planet and a converted B-58 airplane model was a frightening alien spaceship.

There are wonderfully goofy things here that only a kid would understand.  An ultramodern spaceship carrying cargo packed in wooden crates is laughable to adults but perfectly sensible to a ten year old boy whose world includes both watching television and building tree houses.  Characters that could exist in deep space with only an oxygen pill for support stretches credibility, but we hadn't had 8th grade science yet and everything was still possible.  Even to this day there are a few episodes (Invasion Earth and XL5 to H20 for example)that rivet the attention.  In fact, after 40 years Fireball's unpretentious tone still wears better than some modern science fiction, including the often cringe-producing Star Trek or most of the Irwin Allen schlock.

The importance of Fireball in the history of television can be debated ad infinitum, but let's leave that to those who didn't see it as a kid.  For those of us 50-somethings who grew up with this (these) shows, it's a part of our childhood, as real as reading the back of cereal boxes.  1962. Kennedy in the White House.  A Chevy in the driveway.  Good Housekeeping on the coffee table.  John Glenn circling the earth.  Steve Zodiac exploring the universe.  Ah, life is good!

P.S.  When will Four Feather Falls be available to U.S. audiences?!",1147392000,14,2587,4.951276102088167
1811835,3,B00007J6DN,"I inquired about the series years ago and was told whom ever had the rights to it, they were sitting on it. I was floored when I saw it here.

BUT, the price is out of line.  $50 for 39 episodes of a B&W puppet show??",1137110400,4,217,3.6956521739130435
1811836,5,B00007J6DN,"Okay, you have three key officers:  a captain, a doctor, and a science officer.  Oh, and the chief engineer is a Scotsman!  Does any of this sound familiar?

For the 1960s, the original Star Trek series is hailed for breaking feminist ground by allowing 'wimminfolk' to answer phone calls on the bridge and change bedpans down in sickbay.  On Fireball XL-5, Dr. Venus is a brilliant space doctor who often makes key contributions to the success of the missions.  She participates as a fellow adventurer, and not simply as a 'damsel in distress.'  She even flies a supersonic jet and saves a space general's life!

Yes, Dr. Venus gets coffee for Steve Zodiac.  But he's busy flying the spaceship and can't leave his station, and her act is not submissiveness but simple kindness and courtesy.  Remember when men and women liked to please each other?  It seems to me that she is far and away one of the best feminist role models to emerge from 1960s TV sf.

Meanwhile, a few years later on the 'non-sexist' Star Trek, Captain Kirk commands a spaceship where the females all wear miniskirts, the yeoman falls into his lap every time the Romulans attack, and he saves the universe again and again by bedding alien females.  Steve Zodiac may have joked, ""Just like a woman!"" but he always showed Venus genuine respect, while Captain Kirk may have limited his remarks to a smirk but blatantly treated women merely as objects . . . if not playthings.

Yes, Fireball XL-5 is nothing more than a children's show.  It is also nothing less than a ground-breaking television series in the science fiction genre.  It certainly paved the way for the portrayal of more realistic human interest stories in science fiction, and that contribution shouldn't be overlooked just because you can see the strings.",1135036800,17,1790,4.7817589576547235

1811838,5,B00007J6DN,"Fireball XL5 was the second fully-developed Supermarionation series, Supercar being the first. But it was the first Gerry Anderson show to air on a major network (NBC) in the United States. The exploits of Colonel Steve Zodiac, space doctor Venus, professor Matt Matic and Robert the Robot made a big bang in their Saturday morning time slot, and ran for three years. The puppet strings are not as visible as in Supercar, but Fireball XL5 was slow in getting off the ground, and in many ways Supercar was a better show. Unlike Supercar's dynamic opening theme, Fireball opened with moody instrumental music and dramatic shots of the rocket. Professor Matic sounded too much like Supercar's Professor Beaker, but voiceovers make or break a puppet show, and Beaker was the better character. Supercar's casting was better also, with Jimmy and Mitch the monkey for comic relief. The obvious exception was the addition of Venus in Fireball XL5. By the fourth show Fireball had hit its stride, introducing an alien mascot character in the role of Mitch, and a few sparks between Steve and Venus, as hinted at in Barry Gray's clever closing song, smoothly sung by Don Spencer: ""My heart would be a fireball, and you would be my Venus of the stars."" Here are all 39 episodes digitally restored in glorious black and white, along with various extras on each of the five discs, including voice actor commentaries, photo galleries, and ""The Noble Art of Fireball XL5,"" a featurette with comic strip artist Mike Noble.",1108857600,17,1506,4.909803921568628
1811839,5,B00007J6DN,"Those words at the closing credits bring back so many childhood memories. Written by Barry Gray and sung by Don Spencer, an Olympic hopeful from Down Under (did you know he's also Russell Crowe's Father-In-Law?!!), he'd released the song in the UK as a single in 1962 (called ""Fireball""), complete with an extra verse at the end that was edited out (it takes away from the theme for the show). In the early part of 1963, he even performed the song LIVE (in concert) on an LP (One Night Stand on Columbia) which also featured John Leyton, Mike Berry, and Mike Sarne.
Out of all the Gerry Anderson SupermarionatioN puppet epics, this is my favorite. Though the characters my have outgrown this aging 50-year-old, I know I'll still enjoy the nostalgia of it all.

This is a great treat to anyone who wants to relive the children's programs of their youth. It is not sophisticated like ""Thunderbirds"", though.

I suspect that in the case of Fireball XL5, potential audience numbers come into play here. Black and white programmes are always perceived to be low-tech. nowadays, which is a shame. I also wonder just how many people actually remember the series.
I watched Fireball XL5 here in England as a child. For me, it will always be the best of the Anderson productions, partly I suppose because it brings back many fond childhood memories. I certainly think that the programme was ahead of its time and it's clear that it formed the platform for the likes for Stingray, Thunderbirds et al.

I disagree with the first review left here...When ANDERSON did SUPERCAR, this series and STINGRAY... GERRY ANDERSON was hitting his peak, in my opinion.  These are the shows that were much more interesting to watch because they were character driven and had very colorful secondary characters and villians.  I also like the more 'CARTOONY' designs used.  The later series became more about special effects and vehicles.  Not to say THUNDERBIRDS and CAPTAIN SCARLET are not GREAT shows...they are.  I just prefer the earlier work like FIREBALL XL-5.
Also, a clip from this series most recently appeared in the TOM HANK'S film 'THAT THING YOU DO' and everyone knows about his admiration of space series, etc., which this falls into nicely.
This is a GREAT series!  AND I am sure it will look much better than the PAL VHS transfers which have been the only things available until now!

As with earlier releases, all 39x 25-minute monochrome episodes are contained on 5x DVDs in their original series broadcast order when the show aired in 1962-63 (although the production order differed from the broadcast order).

This package however has two big bonuses which set it apart from earlier releases:

1. Disk 6 containing some superb extras:

 The documentary A Wonderland of Stardust on the making of the series featuring almost all the surviving members of the original production team including Gerry & Sylvia and explaining the origins of all the ground-breaking ideas embedded in the series like Robert the Robot, the 2-part Fireball spaceship, the 'jetmobiles', thruster packs and so on

 An excellent documentary Drawn in Supermarionation about the comic-strip spin-offs in TV Comic, TV Century 21 and other print media which extended the life of the show and the characters for years after the TV series ended production

 The colorised episode A Day in the Life of a Space General which is fabulous (why couldn't the entire 39 episodes be given this treatment?)

 Bill Mevins Supercar home movie

 Contemporaneous ice lolly adverts, image galleries and pdf material

2. An outstanding 80-page color booklet crammed with text explaining the detailed historical context of Fireball XL5, how it evolved and was produced, how the series continued to have a rich continuity of life in full-color comic book strips for years following the demise of the TV series, plus a plot guide to all 39x episodes. The booklets front cover is a facsimile of the classic full color TV Century 21 weekly comic showing its shop price of 7d (GB0.03 in todays money, about US$0.04!).
