4125578,5,B003HFDJLW,"Bunnies are of course prolific breeders.  But they can also make for some extaordinarily brutal killers.  Slasher fans need to hop! hop! on this dvd quick.

Writer/director Chad Ferrin (Someone's Knocking At the Door) is quickly establishing himself as a cult horror stud.  This movie is darn near perfect, melding violence, nudity, and touches of dark comedy with some very likeable protagonists and despicable villains.  Just some great writing, acting, pacing, characters, camerawork, bloody effects--this is all done in a very stylish, original fashion.

It's Easter time.  Mindy is the single mother of her 16-yr-old son Nicholas, who is mentally-disabled and has a hard time coping with the loss of his father.  When Mom brings home her new boyfriend Remington, the young kid instinctually puts up the red flag.  Then when Mindy leaves for work, we get to see first hand what a total scumbag this dude really is.  He invites over some prostitutes and other degenerate sleazeball buddies and the party is about to get bloody.  A mysterious killer in a bunny mask is ready to hunt, and it's more than Easter eggs that are going to dye.

Easter Bunny Kill! Kill! is undeniably a spectacular low budget gem!  4.5 stars.  Highly recommended to all you fans of deranged blood-splattered cinematic chaos and mayhem.",1283644800,4,1314,5.051162790697674
4125579,5,B003HFDJLW,"Where do I start? This movie has it all and I mean it all. ""Special Kid"" who's obsessed with Easter, a hot Nurse mother, a sleaze bag boyfriend, a pedophile, a Mexican named Horhay, and much, much more. This movie was shot with very little money, but is worth millions. I can't speak too much about the movie without spoiling all of the surprises...and there are many surprises along the way. This movie was the best I've seen in a long time that tried to capture the intenseness of exploitation, but what separates this one from the others is that it actually does it, at times it was like watching a movie from the exploitation era. And the ending is a truly great ending that needs to be seen to be believed.",1278115200,6,711,4.393939393939394
4125580,4,B003HFDJLW,"This is a re-release!!
Meaning; this was released a while ago (by Plan 10 pictures) with a different cover,
but was discontinued by the manufacturer.
Apparently though - it's getting a re-release by ""Vicious Circle"",
who has been putting out an excellent assortment of brutal indie horror flicks!!
(Sympathy, Hanger, etc.)
Since Ferrin's, all too amazing,  ""Someone's Knocking at the Door"" garnered some praise,
(including my own) EBKK got its re-release,
so now it's finally available on Amazon!!
The plot involves a single widowed mother Mindy
(Played wonderfully by Charlotte Marie who does a great job of capturing that motherly vibe.)
with a mentally handicapped 16 year old son named Nicholas (played by Ricardo Gray).
She's dating Remington (played by Timothy Muskatell who really does an amazing job of being the bad guy),
a real dirt-bag of an ex-con who has some dastardly plans for 'ole Nicholas.
I also love whoever played the pedophile, don't know the actors name, want to say Trent Haaga,
but he was so creepy he actually induced worms under my skin.
When the mothers around Remington puts on his phony fatherly facade.
But when the mother's away... well the bad guys will play,
that is until a figure in a bunny mask shows up to turn this suburban nightmare into a suburban bloodbath.

The gore is certainly present, but it's not mind-blowing, so don't be expecting to clean brains out of the carpet - but it is plentiful.
I will admit I did love the use of power tools. = D
Nothing says horror like power tools. (drill, circular saw, etc.)
Great acting on everyones part.
I would have rather seen a child actor playing the part of Nicolas.
That would have made the movie infinitely more intense.
But that's just personal taste.
Anyway a few other characters are thrown in, prostitutes & thieves, for fodder,
which only adds to the bloody mayhem.
The setting - a house under renovation - seems an odd choice until you consider the weapon-choice
& the fact that this is also a family under renovation
In the end though it makes perfect sense.
In terms of slashers this was actually really good for an independent,
and you can really see that Ferrin is building up to something truly amazing. (Someone's Knocking at the Door)
This is a slasher that walks the line between horror & horredy
- chock full of one-liners you'll find yourself quoting again & again.
Well my wife quotes it anyway. = )
Better than something like ""All the Boys Love Many Lane"", but not as good as let's say ""Red Velvet"".
If you liked Silent Night Deadly Night, you'll like this one as well.

4125581,2,B003HFDJLW,"The story is about a kid named nicholas who has some cognitive problems, his mom says he is MRCP (it's not a normally used term for what he has) . He lives with his mother, Mindy, who is dating a criminal Remington , who is always nice around the mother, but horrible to nicholas behind closed doors. Nicholas loves Easter, and for some reason his mom leaves him alone with Remington, on Easter.  Nicholas' father died on Easter, so this is probably why Nicholas is attached to the holiday. Mayhem ensues when Remington invites his pedophile friend over for a party (sigh), while he goes out to get ladies.
SO! this movie is a pile of trash, it's filmed horribly, it's like they stole all these techniques from other horror movies, but failed. The editing is a total joke, there was a scene with a guy on the toilet for over 3 minutes (this does happen in real life, but do we need to watch him sit there listening to music, we get it, he is using the bathroom and trying to find toilet paper).
Some other scenes just drag on and on and on, i don't care to see Remington walk down the hall in his briefs, i don't care to see Nicholas dance for a good four minutes to a scratchy song. It's gore factor is a waste, they tried to do more than they could do, which was sweet, but it fell flat.
The only thing remotely good about this movie was the acting, and that truly is not saying much. If you are a fan of slasher movies, you may not like this because there isn't much gore, it's mostly hallway shots and rabbits.",1436659200,,1514,4.256944444444445
4125582,4,B003HFDJLW,"I enjoyed the guts outta this movie. It was fairly well acted. A bit predictable but fun all the same. I was pleasantly surprised. It's probably forgettable and not at all deep, but worth your time for an hour and a half of entertainment.",1434931200,,238,4.431818181818182
4125583,4,B003HFDJLW,"I was bored and decided to watch this on Prime yesterday.  It was so original and funny.  The actor that played the 16 year old son was my favorite character even though he pulled a Tropical Thunder and went ""Full R*t*rd"".  It's definitely a low budget film that has a 70's horror vibe but that is why I liked it. Definitely will become a cult classic.",1434240000,,352,4.303030303030303

4125586,5,B003HFDJLW,"What can I say?  I loved this movie from start to finish.  Congratulations for rising above such a ridiculous title and giving me a movie that I seriously did not know what to expect from frame to frame.  Delectably sleazy, darkly hilarious and perversely unsettling, and ultimately...a heck of a lot of sleazy fun!

4125587,1,B003HFDJLW,"I watched this movie with some friends during our ""B Movie Night"". I never expect much out of the movies we watch but this one so far was the worst. There is a 20 minute scene of the rapist guy on crutches walking up the steps and stumbling at his car. They prolong the scenes because the plot is so short. It reminds me of when I wrote a paper in middle school and needed to make it 3 pages so I adjusted the margins and the font and added useless lines of meaningless text to fit the criteria. As exciting as someone stumbling at their car for 10 minutes can be, if they actually trimmed it down the movie would be like 30 minutes long but I wouldn't feel so angry having had to watch the whole thing just to find out what happens. The ending is probably the only reason why I gave this movie any stars at all. It was nice to see a warm twist.

The plot of this movie is about the extent of a porn but instead of having sex people are getting murdered for 10 minutes each scene with power tool. They never really leave this house where all the killing is happening. Often times there were points of the movie that were staggering so much me and my friends shouted ""I hate this movie"". We only agreed to finish it because it was half way over and we needed to see where it was going.",1335139200,,1284,4.075098814229249
4125588,1,B003HFDJLW,"The story is not bad but the acting over all is grade Z. Were oh were did they find the actor who plays the handicapped kid in this movie (Ricardo Gray) ? Ricardo Gray should find another job and I mean that from the bottom of my heart, this dude can not act a lick. Remington (Timothy Muskatell) is the main character in the film and he is good as a crazed grifter hell bent on doing what ever he feels like at any cost. Mild nudity, lame gore and all around debauchery is not enough to keep this turd afloat as this movie is bad from start to final end. Stay away.",1306800000,,566,4.017699115044247
4125589,5,B003HFDJLW,"EASTER BUNNY KILL! KILL! is one of the best low-budget, cult films I've seen in quite some time. Filled w/ black / silly humour, gore, and a general atmosphere of filth, EBKK packs a gooshy wallop! If you crave classic films like STREET TRASH, SLIME CITY, BASKET CASE, or BRAIN DAMAGE, then Chad Ferrin's (SOMEONE'S KNOCKING AT THE DOOR) festive foray into the horrors of EASTER should be a dream! Ferrin has a true eye for what makes a fantastic cult movie. While watching EBKK, I felt as though I'd been transported back to some grimy, 1970s-80s grindhouse theatre! I loved every bloody second of it...",1296691200,,604,4.7075471698113205
4125590,5,B003HFDJLW,"Finally!  The film we've always crazed for our holiday film viewing.  We have Christmas films, like Silent Night Deadly Night and Christmas Evil.  We have New Years Eve covered, with New Years Evil.  Thanksgiving is all taken care of with, Thankskilling.  So it makes obvious sense, that finally a Easter film would come along that would be able to satisfy our horror cravings during the holidays.  So gather up the kids, and set them all in front of the television, and enjoy Chad Ferrin's uber disgusting, Easter Bunny Kill Kill!

Easter Bunny Kill Kill is utter filth, and sometimes we all need to get dirty.  This low budget NEU holiday classic is about a young African American handi-capped Easter bunny fetishist, named Nicholas.  His mother, a single hard working nurse who's just met a very charming gentleman by the name of Remington.  What you don't know about Remmington, is that he's a sleazy disgusting criminal who guns down gas station clerks with a 12 gauge and an Easter bunny mask.

As Mindy and Remmington's relationship progresses forward, she asked him to move in with her and Nicholas.  Nicholas's tard-tuition right away senses that this guy is no good.  At the last minute Mindy is called by the hospital to work a double shift.  Remmington kindly offers his new girlfriend his help in watching Nicholas for the night.  And this is where you're gonna start to feel uncomfortable.

With the doors wide open, Remmington decides to ""make a buck or two"" off of Nicholas, so he calls up a child molester friend of his, tells him to ""come over and play with the retard"" and ""bring the drugs.""  As the tensions between Remmington and Nicholas reach an all out fail safe, there's a knock on the door, and the fun begins.

What happens after, is an all out super disgusting gory vomit fest, that leaves a massive body count, that includes several of the key players and some dead nude hookers  Forcing the viewer into a complete 360, the film brilliantly and quite hilariously twists from this epic of filth and depravity into this sweet light hearted happy ending, that's almost borders on classic Monty Python.

Easter Bunny Kill Kill is a pretty low budget film.  However,  it looks great.  The performances from the cast are disturbingly brilliant, including a last minute cameo from Trent (Tromeo & Juliet) Haaga.  Easter Bunny Kill Kill is a true exploitaton film, that should be enjoy'd after everyone in your family has just finished your Easter dinner.  Which makes me ask, how did a religious holiday somehow become associated with a rabbit anyhow?",1283990400,2,2573,4.819634703196347
8397062,1,B003HFDJLW,This was not only beyond a B movie it was a flat out horrible and not in a good way. I had to keep slapping myself to stay awake because there was so very little action.  Too far and between to keep my interest.,1492214400,,211,3.7954545454545454
8397063,1,B003HFDJLW,WTF!! I am very patient when it comes to sub-par horror flicks but I lasted a total of 30 seconds before I had to turn this movie off! I think I killed a few brain cells watching the 30 seconds.,1467504000,,194,3.875
8397064,4,B003HFDJLW,This little nugget is good for exactly what it claims to be.  I know that it has its problems and that there are a few but it never did leave me bored or not entertained.  The Pedophile was as creepy as I could ever expect one to be.  The moms Jerk to put it lightly boyfriend was as annoying as I would need him to be for me to cheer when he died.  So yeah its not that different or special.  But its definitely not boring and worth the little bit of time invested but if you watch movies like this you probably have a little time on ur hands.,1466985600,,544,3.909090909090909
