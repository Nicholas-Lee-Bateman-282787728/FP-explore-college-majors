8581737,4,B00CHBC0RG,"Offender was a good movie, possibly a great one, but I can't make that distinction, feeling like I missed a good portion of it. The story is solid and the acting is terrific, but Offender is a British film, and some of the accents were so thick, that I had a really hard time with the dialogue. The story centers on Tommy Nix (Joe Cole), a man on a mission, to avenge the savage beating of his wife, and the death of his unborn son. Tommy has a problem though, all the men responsible are already in jail. Acting on impulse, Tommy decides to get arrested, and sent to the same facility to enact his revenge. Being that this was a British film, I was not familiar with any of the actors, so I really didn't know what to expect. After seeing the film, I can tell you this much, remember the name Joe Cole, because this young man is destine for stardom. He gives one of the most powerful performances I've seen all year. Cole's performance is really what separates this film from similar stories. Tommy Nix was not a superhero, but what he has to endure at this strange prison, leading up to the exciting conclusion, was really something to see. Offender seemed blend originality with several similar story lines. It's easy to see the influence of  Payback, Oz (The TV Show), and Sleepers, while watching this film. The writers took just enough to enhance the film, without making it seem like they were ripping anyone off. I really enjoyed this film and it's star Joe Cole, but I feel as though the thick accents and mumbled dialogue took something away. As someone who isn't used to hearing it everyday, it made the film somewhat difficult to understand at times. It's still worth seeing, if only for Cole's performance. Maybe the next time I watch it I'll put on the closed captioning.",1390780800,,1785,4.5092592592592595
8581738,1,B00CHBC0RG,"We couldn't hardly understand a word that was said, the music was horrid, and just a bunch of mess.  We couldn't sit through even half of it.  I was simply going off of how many stars it had and the way I read it seemed like a good plot.  I think I'll stop paying attention to how many stars something has as this is not the only movie that people gave a very undeserving high rating.",1375660800,,384,4.026315789473684
8581739,2,B00CHBC0RG,"Heavy accents, really hard for my wife and I to understand what they were saying. The movie is weird and I would wait to rent this one until you run out of all options for movie watching.",1371168000,,187,4.081081081081081
8581740,5,B00CHBC0RG,"Nix's quest to avenge the murder of his unborn child was captivating. Convincing performances, excellent production values and an entertaining story make Offender a film worth watching.",1369180800,5,185,5.888888888888889
8581741,5,B00CHBC0RG,"Don't get fooled by the cheap-looking DVD art.  This is an amazing independent film.

Offender clearly serves as a tribute to violent jail classics like Scum (1979) and Bad Boys (1983).  The action is old-school and gritty, the soundtrack always keeps the energy going, and the acting is actually surprisingly good.  Joe Cole does a great job as the unsmiling avenger, making sure everyone pays for their crimes.

This film is definitely worth buying.",1369180800,5,451,5.04054054054054
8581742,5,B00CHBC0RG,The film is very well made. i really was not expecting it to be that great but the director and cast have done a great job making this film. The film is raw and gritty like a modern day SCUM. Check it out when you get a chance.,1369180800,3,227,3.75
8581743,4,B00CHBC0RG,"This is a very good film which I was very surprised about as there have been a fair few Brit duds of late. This stars Joe Cole as Tommy Nicks, he is `a father to be' with his girl who is also a probation officer in one of the less upmarket parts of London. After the London riots she has a slight spike in workload and gets herself into a position where she might pose a threat to the local vilainary. So they take swift and Draconian action, resulting in Tommy's world being blown upside down.

He is left with nothing but revenge on his mind so tracks them down to a Young Offenders Institution (YOI) and gets himself incarcerated to exact retribution. On the way he will have to deal with nasty screws, nasty inmates, nasty cops and some very nasty goings on indeed.

This then is a sort of `Scum' meets `Death Wish' and it is all done very well with a not very well known cast. There are some issues with plot and factual procedures re the police and even in the YOI, but that does not really mar what is actually a visceral and gritty piece of cinema. Special mention has to go to Shaun Dooley as nasty Prison Guard, Nash (`The Woman in Black'), who plays the ambiguous loser with aplomb. The language is all urban street and so for some they may wish they had sub titles, but it actually eases off as the film progresses and it all adds to the realism. Whilst it is violent, it does not play on those incidents as this is actually a moody thriller and the tension and underlying violence is palpable throughout.

The music is good, the direction is good and the acting is well good as some might say, all of the kids have attitude and pimp rolls. There is a walk on by a mad Scottish guy called Genghis played by new comer Brian Vernel and he was bloody genius, so keep an eye out for him. All in all a very good Brit Crime Thriller and very well worth checking out; writer Paul van Carter has made a very decent follow up to his 2010 offering `Shank' and I hope this film does even better.",1357689600,8,1996,4.219895287958115
