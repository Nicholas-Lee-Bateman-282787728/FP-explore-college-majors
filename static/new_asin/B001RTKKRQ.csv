3778500,5,B001RTKKRQ,"This is a unique film that shows a different side of Japan, in a way like the original Japanese version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shall-We-Dance/dp/B0002V7S34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shall We Dance?</a>, but what makes this film even more special is that this is a Hollywood movie about the cultural side of Japan.

Obviously I'm not going to spoil the film by revealing the plot, so I'd like to concentrate on other things. If you have been to Japan and have experienced the ramen noodles, this film will make you smile all the way especially after the ramen restaurant appears. The experts know that this kind of slightly old and 'scummy' restaurants serve the best ramen! If you watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tampopo/dp/B000GG4RMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tampopo</a>, you must have seen how serious Japanese people are about ramen noodles, and that the whole thing about good ramen is discussed at a philosophical level!

My favourite part of this film is that the role of the Ramen Master is played by a brilliant brilliant actor, Toshiyuki Nishida. He is a VERY well-known and my favourite Japanese actor, but unfortunately people outside Japan haven't had much chance to see his work, because this film is his first ever Hollywood movie appearance. His appearing in Hollywood scene was long overdue, but at last he has arrived!

Brittany Murphy is lovely, too, and through learning how to make good ramen with her very tetchy Master (Nishida), she starts to see what is really important in her heart, and there is this wonderful moment of eye contact when these two stubborn guys who don't understand each other with language can exchange something in their hearts.

I'm glad that this kind of film that shows an ordinary life of a working class Japanese man has been introduced in this way, because as far as I know Japan has a lot more than just gadgets, bullet trains, karaoke, ninja or samurai. Hope you'll enjoy it!

Just one minor point I didn't appreciate much was the music that is played each time the ramen shop appears, because it's so Chinese! I think the idea is that this tune is used as a 'theme' of this shop, which is the central stage of the whole film, but in my view the music is slightly misleading!

FYI, you might recognize the Ramem Master, Toshiyuki Nishida, from his famous role as lovely 'Pigsy' in legendary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monkey-1979/dp/B00211YJT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monkey (1979)</a>, which has had a large cult following in the UK and in Japan, and is still shown late at night sometimes in those countries.

Hope this helps! (I miss ramen now!)",1244937600,8,2761,5.436915887850467
3778501,5,B001RTKKRQ,"This romantic comedy owes its inspiration to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tampopo/dp/B000GG4RMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tampopo</a>&nbsp;the critically acclaimed,  gently quirky Japanese film about a female mastering the masculine art of ramen noodle soup making.  Brittany Murphy is really quite good as a rudderless 20-something American abandoned in Toyko by her boyfriend. She happens upon a ramen shop and is inspired to master the art of making the perfect Ramen soup.  There is a lot of attention to detail in set design and costume, although Ms. Murphy's shoes are probably not what kitchen help would really wear to put in a 12-hour day.

The Ramen Girl has some subtitles due to its authentic Japanese cast which lend the feel of an art house flick.  Another nice touch is a soup making competition in which actor Tsutomu Yamazaki, who was the truck driving mentor in Tampopo, turns in a comic turn as the judge of the soup making competition.  I believe this movie has enough charm to appeal to a wide range of viewers and if you really like it, hey, check out Tampopo as well.",1243641600,91,1137,5.359550561797753
3778502,5,B001RTKKRQ,"An American girl on her own in Tokyo. Sounds like LOST IN TRANSLATION but it's nothing like that movie. I was really moved by this lovely story of a young girl looking for some sort of meaning in her life. She finds it in the most unexpected place of all, a Japanese noodle shop. Movies about food have a special charm and this one doesn't disappoint. It has the feeling of a modern fairy tale. It's kind and gentle and wise. The girl played by Brittany Murphy has more or less given up on life and love and ever finding a purpose in the world. She's come to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend who turns out to be a louse. He dumps her and heads for a job in Osaka. In her lonliness, she is drawn to the neighborhood ramen shop where she finds comfort in the food and the ambient warmth of the place. The owner is a drunken tyrant who keeps begging her to get out and go home. But going home would mean utter defeat and humiliation. She decides instead that she wants to learn to cook ramen. Along the way, she meets the local Japanese customers, is befriended by some rather aimless ex-pats, and meets a lovely young Japanese man. All contribute to her learning to dedicate herself to something that gives her life some meaning, even if that something just happens to be noodles. The cast is superb. The direction, design, color photography all contribute to making THE RAMEN GIRL a first rate viewing experience.",1243468800,7,1410,4.406130268199234
3778503,3,B001RTKKRQ,"This straight to video film starring Brittany Murphy might not be everyone's cup of tea, but this indie film managed to win me over in spite of its formulaic structure and initially silly premise.

This is the story of a lost 20-something trying to find herself and essentially grow up by learning the ""fine art"" of making ramen in Tokyo. Many reviewers are comparing it to the delightful Japanese comedy TAMPOPO, and you could definitely say the premise was inspired by that film. However, I'd call this film more of a ""Lost In Translation"" light. The characters are engaging (an outstanding comedic Japanese cast) and as a foreigner who has lived in Tokyo I can tell the screenwriter and director both have a pretty good understanding of the Japanese people and their spirit.

""The Ramen Girl"" is a bit formulaic in some of its plot points and characters, but it's ultimately heartwarming. I'd recommend ""The Ramen Girl"" as a second course to ""Lost In Translation"" for anyone who wants to have a ""white-girls who find themselves in Tokyo"" movie marathon.",1243123200,5,1056,4.861111111111111

3778507,3,B001RTKKRQ,"Hollywood has an irritating habit of placing white saviors in ""exotic"" communities. ""Dances with Wolves"" is one example, ""The Last Samurai"" is another (who learns the samurai arts in one winter spent in a mountain village, anyway???). ""The Ramen Girl"" is a variation on the theme, with hapless white girl Brittany Murphy, whose boyfriend dumps her in Tokyo, deciding she's going to be a legit ramen chef. The story is ultimately unbelievable, but the film is saved by Toshiyuki Nishida as the crusty, cranky restaurateur who verbally abuses Murphy into respecting the traditional ways of Japan. The film also has some insight into the aesthetic of ramen-making, and a little bit of what Japan is like (the scene where Murphy and her new Japanese boyfriend visit the Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum, a wonderful place, is pretty cool).",1503964800,,830,5.110294117647059

3778522,5,B001RTKKRQ,"Easily Brittany Murphy's best role in her short life!  A somewhat self-absorbed, spoiled and very entitled American girl is living in Tokyo with her boyfriend who has decided she is more of a liability than anything else when it comes to his ability to being able to pack his whole life into a single suitcase and go where the wind may take him.

Suddenly alone in this foreign land making her living as a proofreader of English in the corporate world, she longs for something more meaningful, something for which she can develop a passion, something into which she can pour herself and her love!

Late one night, lonely, sad and full of self-pity, she is drawn to the light coming from a single business still open in her neighborhood, a very modest, very simple Ramen shop that somehow beckons her to come inside.  Where she is curtly told in a tongue she cannot understand, ""CLOSED! GO HOME"" and having no comprehension of what was just said, instead of leaving, she sits down and cries--Equally unaware of what she is saying to them, the owners of the Ramen shop try to figure out what is going on, why she is there, and more importantly, how to GET RID OF HER!

And get rid of her they do.....but not for long.  No, She has found her calling, against hundreds of years of tradition and culture, she has decided that she must become a Ramen Chef (an honor unimaginable to most Japanese women) and--without really consulting them, she decided that they--the owners of the shop, who do not speak any more English than she does Japanese, they will be her teachers, her mentors, her sponsors in this new passion to become a Ramen Chef...in movie that will have you tearing up one minute and then laughing out loud and the hijinx so typical of Brittany Murphy.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie!",1488067200,2,1791,4.5956112852664575
3778523,5,B001RTKKRQ,Outstanding!  Enjoyed very much.,1487980800,,32,7.0
3778524,4,B001RTKKRQ,"This is probably one of Brittany Murphy's least-known films, but one where she stands alone as the central character. It has charm and warmth, but unfortunately, Murphy was a little typecast as the ""girl who has followed her guy somewhere; guy unexpectedly dumps her; and now what? with her life as she learns she must buckle down and grow"" -- so her character's initial storyline and character development will not be particularly surprising.

However, despite that, I found a lot to be charmed about by this movie. Maybe it's my own deep love of ramen, and how I would enjoy getting to learn how to make really fantastic ramen from scratch, but like the soup itself, this film ends up feeling warm and comforting. The majority of the story takes place within a small ramen shop, with a colorful cast of regulars. Murphy's character eventually grows up, of course, and one wants to see her ultimately succeed. It is an enjoyable movie and one that will sneak into your heart.",1487808000,3,976,4.741176470588235

Like a dileegish bowl of ramen, Robert Allan Ackerman's masterpiece will encompass you in steam and leave you warm and slightly damp. No wonder this was the last film he ever directed! Once you've reached perfection, there is no use in continuing. In fact, I wonder if he died. Brittany Murphy's performance was 80% perfect 10% perfect and 10% PERFECT. I've never seen anyone grip a cigarette like that, such grace and disregard. She was on the bring of tears for most of the film, which made my cat and I also shed some salty wet ones.

This is just a little note on the buying options available. I had seen this movie many times before actually purchasing and noticed that in the version I bought (DVD May 26 2009) has some minor language editing. Two such examples: in the beginning when Ethan is leaving, in the original version Abby tells Ethan to go F*$! himself, while in the version I received, Abby tells him he's a jerk. Another such example is when Abby is locked outside and calls Sensei an a*shole, and again she edited in calling him a jerk. Does this editing ruin the film? No, but if such modifications bother you, please take note.",1470268800,,738,4.556390977443609

The many deleted scenes were a mixed bunch - some magical realism (including a tengu song and dance number!) and a great deal more on Gretchen. I can see why they cut them - while good scenes I think they would have disrupted the flow - but I'm glad to have seen them. If nothing else, we have a reason the ramen girl was so stubborn about her Goddess Ramen beyond simple orneriness.

Story line is a young woman abandoned in Tokyo, by her loser rock boy friend, tries to find her footing in the Ramen business. She becomes the kitchen scut to become a Ramen chef, from the local and tyrannical Ramen master, Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida) and his fearful but loving wife, Reiko (Kimiko Yo).  There is something that the husband and wife team bring to the movie, so opposite of Brittany Murphy, that melds the 3 into a family.  Extremely heart warming.

It's about finding one's true path in life, one's passion. Yes, there's romance, but it's not the main plot of the story.

3778601,5,B001RTKKRQ,"Love, love love, this movie. Brittany does an amazing job as a character who is so lost that only soup can save her. At moments it's a little trite, but I think that's sort of the point and it works. The dynamic between her and Toshiyuki Nishida is powerful, hilarious, and ultimately quite tender. It's when he takes Abby to his mother's home that you really see how much he cares about her finding her path, even though he hasn't openly said yet how much he wants her to succeed. During this scene, it's a little beyond the rational suspension of disbelief that Abby and Maezumi's mother appear to understand each other perfectly, but it feels like such a forgivable ""offense"" when there's so much about this movie to enjoy.",1452643200,6,726,4.592307692307692

How f*&#ed up is it to travel to Japan or another country to be dumped by your boyfriend/girlfriend & stranded in the middle of nowhere?

3778647,2,B001RTKKRQ,"The first 10 minutes or so of the film are cute. There are 4 or 5 scenes where cultural aspects of Japanese/Tokyo life are well-represented. The cinematography isn't bad, despite the many close-ups of Murphy's frog-like face. Murphy's acting is consistently awful. The story itself is infantile, completely unbelievable, makes no pretense of being emotionally, culturally realistic or honest, paints a deservedly damning picture of Americans, pays tremendous disservice to ramen, noodle shops and ramen culture, and is simply embarrassing, predictable and blatantly self-serving. Since Murphy was one of the producers, we needn't waste much time wondering how or why this movie came into being. Why did I see it? I heard a well-known Japanese ramen chef mention it at a lecture as one of the few films (Tampopo is the benchmark) that deals with ramen, though he too didn't recommend it highly.",1427760000,,893,5.251748251748252

3778729,1,B001RTKKRQ,"I'm rather SHOCKED (""Shocked I tell you!"" ha ha - movie reference here, hee) at the overly generous number of four and five star reviews here. This was one of the more painful movies I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. It's pretty much a blatant rip-off ... ahem ... a retelling (hee) of the absolute genius Japanese classic ""Tampopo"". The circumstances and characters are changed, but the premise is pretty much the same. However, all similarities end there. ""Ramen Girl"" is cheesy, boring, annoying, and just poorly done all around. ""Tampopo"" is a many threaded story that's funny, smart, satirical, well informed (about food, wine, snobbery, culture (pop and haute), Zen, etc), sensual and sexy, and just oh sooooo yummy. It's a fun and goofy celebration of the senses that weaves and wends in a million directions yet is totally cohesive and lucid, AND entertaining as heck. A final nice touch is its super simple last shot of a baby breast feeding on a park bench, tying up the whole movie so neatly with a quiet tacit ""Aha!"" moment: The origin of the food and sex relationship. ""Ramen Girl"" on the other hand is the classic product of bad Hollywood aesthetics, dominated by cheesy cliches, barren imagination, bad writing, bad acting, and super annoying characters (yuck!), obsessively and compulsively dumbing down anything that might upset their ""perceived"" brain dead audience. Perhaps for those who had never seen ""Tampopo"", the insult might just be that of a bad movie. For those who LOVE ""Tampopo"", this borderlines on criminal and responsible parties should be subject to severe punishment (like being forced to watch their own freakin' cr@p movies non-stop for ten years). Sadly, this reminds me of another Hollywood assassination of another gorgeous film that they had no right touching. ""City of Angels"" was supposed to be an American remake of the indescribably beautiful German classic by Wim Wenders, ""Wings of Desire"". Instead, it turned out to be floating toxic turds that burned my retinas, insulted my intelligence, and has scarred me for life, ha ha. Hollywood should really learn their own limitations and leave all the more subtle forms of art, life and living alone. They were soooo far out of their depths yet they had no idea of their own ineptitude. Gag. Gag on top a gag. But it's not funny to anyone, except - I suppose - to those who are continuously rolling in the dough regardless of how bad they are. So the joke's on us.

Cheers All! Didn't mean to be such a bummer here. But sometimes, a man's gotta stand for something and just plainly speak his mind, ha ha ha ha.",1408320000,,2617,4.841517857142857

We are never told until nearly the end why the old ramen chef is so depressed and gruff, but it becomes clear and is the focus of final rise to glory.

3778753,1,B001RTKKRQ,"Very disappointing movie.
Not unlike the dish, on which the movie revolves around.
There is much fanfare about Japanese ramen as if it had some kind of magical taste and magical attributes. But the fact is, it's a rather primitive broth of miso with sometimes the unfortunate addition of pork belly slices (adding straight up grease to the mix).
I can only concede that the noodles themselves have some redeeming value. Sometimes.
The flavorless, congealing-as-you-dine concoction itself can't be redeemed even with the udon spice flakes. (maybe with sriracha, but that's for pho. Sorry.)
Getting back on track, the whole premise of the movie is like the broth. Primitive. Flavorless. Boring.
They add in (what I assume they imagined would be) some touching scenes to add some texture and meaning to the story, but just like the pork slices, they just add useless fat.
Brittany Murphy is like the noodles, she provides some value to watching.. the eye candy anyway. (this may or may not work for everyone. If Brittany Murphy isn't eye candy for you, feel free to knock off another star)
I suspect some japanese tourism groups have funded this movie to some extent.
If you inexplicably just love japan and anything japanese, then you'll just slurp it all up.
Otherwise, it's a terrible way to waste your time.",1407283200,,1308,4.923076923076923

Also, it only seemed to be about the soul of the broth....is there a noodle soul too? This movie has elements of the French Chocolat set in Japan.",1403395200,,251,4.8604651162790695

3778836,4,B001RTKKRQ,It is sad that the actress is not longer alive but It is a interesting movie.  I wanted to enjoy a family night and I will recommend to others. Good innocent drama.,1402444800,,164,4.125
3778837,3,B001RTKKRQ,"Such a pity that after that movie where she said I'll never tell to Michael Douglas from a nuthouse padded cell, Brittany Murphy wasn't rewarded with a long running network series about a former ingenue stripped of all illusions a la post sentinel Kitty Pryde.

Instead we have this intentionally inappropriate and unbelievable eager to please awkward schtick.  So does she really feel this way or is she faking it?

Brittany Murphy had very big dark Italian eyes.  But they click from intelligent in repose to cloaked when she cracks a fake smile.

Tammy Blanchard is a standout as a redheaded child playing jaded and bears a striking resemblance to Danielle pane baker.

So this movie which is not really watchable  is more about expats faking it in the land of the rising sun and friendly faces are probably crypto Koreans and Taiwanese.

This actress and her sad face are as jarring and intentionally out of place as to not be a mistake as today's google news insertion of Japan's dismay at the United Nations recognition bid of comfort bid in all news articles related to diaoyutai:

3778844,4,B001RTKKRQ,I loved this movie but found it hard to think that Brittany Murphy was no longer alive. She was a very talented young lady and the movie proves it.,1401926400,,147,4.103448275862069

The ending was bad. The beginning was bad. The middle was bad. I slept worst than the ramen master guy. Seriously. If you have too much time on your hands, then maybe consider watching this. If you treasure life even a tiny bit, don't waste your time watching this. It's not a feel good movie, it's a WTFWASTHAT?! movie.",1401667200,,479,4.517241379310345

3778860,3,B001RTKKRQ,"I watched this because it had a 4 star rating.  I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.

It isn't a bad movie and it is entertaining enough to keep watching.  But, the 4 star rating is too high.  The ideas in this movie are much better done in ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and ""Babbette's Feast"", or even ""Simply Irresistible""... right down to the emotions of the chef being conveyed to the diners (people weeping or laughing).  Ultimately, the biggest problem with the movie is that Murphy's character is really not all that likeable a person, and the transformation from lost ditz to beloved and talented chef is not well played out in the film.  I watched it through the to end, but I won't watch it again and won't be recommending it to friends.",1401148800,,745,4.4411764705882355
3778861,5,B001RTKKRQ,"This was a very cute movie. Watched it with my teenage daughter and we both enjoyed it.

3778863,4,B001RTKKRQ,"As a guy who hates chick flicks, I really liked this.  Parts of the story are a little weak, but the overall story is quite funny.  Men, watch is with your lady and you'll score points.",1400457600,,185,4.111111111111111
3778864,4,B001RTKKRQ,Stumbled on this one to my delight!  English subtitles for the Japanese and worth it!  Miss this talented actress.

3778866,4,B001RTKKRQ,"But this movie was surprisingly good. Watched it after a mention of the film by Anthony Bourdain on his Hokkaido episode of No Reservations. Cute, funny, positive with a minimal plot. An easy watch to bring a smile to your face. Initial hallucination scene reminiscent of Amelie and several stereotypical characters makes for predictability to an extent. No reason to compare this to any other film since it is it's own story, though it certainly shares many similarities to a plethora of east meets west movies. Long story short: Decent movie, will make you hungry.",1399766400,,566,4.968421052631579

3778868,2,B001RTKKRQ,I would have almost rated this a 3 star but couldn't give it that much. Worth watching if you just want to watch a movie,1399766400,,120,3.84
3778869,4,B001RTKKRQ,"Sad to watch this sweet girl who died so young. But as for the film and the entertainment value, I enjoy Asian movies, this one was no exception. A life lesson for this young gal on an unexpected journey in Japan",1399680000,,212,4.195121951219512

3778871,4,B001RTKKRQ,"If you're in the mood for. Kight-hearted and touching movie, yu may like The Ramen Girl.

3778873,3,B001RTKKRQ,"This movie was better than I thought it would be. It's not necessarily funny, but it's quirky and entertaining. Be forewarned though, there are a lot of subtitles. I assumed that because this starred Brittany Murphy that it would be in English. Parts of it are, but it is primarily subtitles.",1399248000,,292,4.745098039215686
3778874,3,B001RTKKRQ,"I thought this movie had a unique plot line, even though it is based off of another movie. However there were so many little things that just kind of got left behind, like in a way it was like Psycho, the way psycho just leaves you hanging on some parts. However it is a fun quirky watch, especially if you're a Brittany Murphy fan.

Overall it was okay, I didn't particularly laugh at any parts, I smiled a lot but that's it.",1399075200,,426,4.195121951219512

3778886,4,B001RTKKRQ,"A great little film showing cultural differences, character growth, and of course a happy ending. The copy I received was edited with the profanity removed. It was relatively seamless and natural, though there are one or two places it feels awkward. Not disappointed as I wanted this for my collection and doesn't kill the film at all. The Japanese is fun to try to make out as well!",1397779200,,383,4.647058823529412

3778890,3,B001RTKKRQ,"I enjoyed it, but it didn't seem very original.  The lead supposedly grew from her slacker state to someone more disciplined, but she always appeared motivated and determined, so you never really saw the growth.  It is funny to see the Japanese subtitles of dialog she doesn't understand, though.",1397260800,,296,5.020408163265306
3778891,3,B001RTKKRQ,Not great but just enjoyable. Girl who gets stranded in Japan and chooses to study under a Ramen master who is a seemingly horrible person. She sticks it out and well I will let you find out. Nice little movie when there is nothing better.,1397088000,,239,4.333333333333333

3778895,5,B001RTKKRQ,"This is far more than the synopsis alludes to.  This is a tale of self-discovery.  Our heroine is a needy, ""successful"" but adorable and sweet emotional wreck who finally decides to take the plunge towards independent adulthood.

A fish out of water tale, with the tiniest touch of magic, the film focuses primarily on the relationship between the main character and her teacher (with just a little romance on the side).  The acting in the film is excellent--particularly that of the Japanese Chef--her ""sensei"", who plays his role with the perfect blend of irascibility and vulnerability.  His character could have come across as just a bully--and he comes close several times, but the actor manages to convey a complex human being, one who is hurting and determined not to let anyone else in.  If anything, the script is about the human spirit and our need for connection and purpose.  What makes the film overall is the lack of stereotypes; there are no generic characters here.  They all feel 3-dimensional and very, very real.  Moreover, it is a film that defies conventional expectations.  It's quietly entertaining.",1396051200,,1122,5.0162162162162165

I love the grumpy guy and the persistence from Brittany Murphy's character.  This shows a flip side to what is more common here in the US.  Here we have immigrants who struggle to learn the culture, laws, language and what is socially acceptable.  I enjoyed seeing her wanting and willing to learn to be accepted and worked hard to learn the art of the Ramen.  Brittany Murphy and the cast did a fantastic job.

3778918,5,B001RTKKRQ,"When I first started watching this movie, I was expecting a typical, formulaic romantic comedy and I figured I'd get bored quickly, but decided to give it a chance in the hopes that the setting of Tokyo and a story involving ramen would add something different. I was so pleasantly surprised!

This isn't a romantic comedy at all, even though it usually gets lumped in with them. It's a story about a young woman's journey to independence, self-discovery and self-awareness when she finds herself alone in a foreign country. The cover is also misleading, and gives the impression of an American movie that might make fun of Japanese culture. This movie never does that. It embraces Japanese culture and values.

The relationship that is really highlighted in this movie more than any romance is the one that forms between master and apprentice as Abby (Murphy) undertakes the study of Ramen. Watching these two characters from different worlds finding ways to work together and communicate while not being able to say a word in each other's languages is funny, frustrating and also very touching. Overall it's a lighthearted, feel good movie, but the story is quite beautiful and has some inspirational lessons. Everyone should watch The Ramen Girl!",1391212800,,1249,5.028985507246377
3778919,3,B001RTKKRQ,"But to say this is a good movie is going a bit far.

This is NOT Brittany Murphy's best work by far.

The movie is well done and the shot composition is interesting but the story itself is a little lackluster.  Pointless characters are introduced then dropped.

The main character is whiny and pigheaded and you just want to shake her.  The romance is awkward and uninspiring.

And really after being in a country for over a year, the character should know Japanese better.

I have not recommended it to my friends nor would I watch it again.",1391040000,,542,4.469387755102041

3778921,3,B001RTKKRQ,"I enjoyed this movie, but Brittany Murphy was too...how do I put this.. ""doe eyed""?  I have seen two, maybe three, movies where she didn't act so ""DUH"". This particular movie would have been better with another actress, IMOP. Otherwise, it was a great take on a subject not seen often. I don't know why, but it felt a little ""Kill Bill-ish"" to me as well as Karate Kid. Now I must make a bowl a Ramen noodles. It certainly won't compare to the real thing, but I try to perk it up by adding some Chinese 5 Spice, extra veggies and perhaps some hot chili flakes-Ooh, some garlic chili paste would be yummy as well. OK, now I'm really craving it.",1390608000,,643,4.270491803278689

Laughter, sadness then right back to laughter again. you as the viewer will identify with how Brittany's character feels and you feel all of the pain and sadness with her.

The sensei teaches her about spirit, about heart - the two most important ingredients in making ramen - or anything in life. A highly underrated, overlooked movie.  Recommend as a tribute to Murphy.

This film has undertones that are meaningful to life such as finding a place in the world through hard work and perseverance: The Ramen Girl is more about a persons self discovery than it is romance. Other themes include developing an awareness for other cultures and moving on from being stuck in ruts from which we sometimes see no exit. On some levels this is an ecnouraging film about living life and it is definitely worth a view.,1371168000,,516,4.681318681318682

3778974,2,B001RTKKRQ,"The premise seemed interesting, but the movie was painful to watch in many parts.  An American girl travels to Japan to be with her boyfriend who abandons her soon after her arrival.  She is left with the keys to his apartment and as she tries to make sense of her life she is drawn by the lights in the ramen shop across the street.  She comes up with the idea to devote her life to ramen and basically forces herself onto the proprietors so that the chef will teach her how to make ramen.  She starts off with cleaning duties and eventually learns how to make ramen, but not before many excruciating scenes with her arguing with the chef (who only speaks and understands Japanese) in English.  Even after she has been in Japan for a year her understanding and ability to speak Japanese is no better than when she arrives (and we're to believe she was Phi Betta Kappa!)  I just wanted to knock her in the head and tell her to have some respect and learn the language and culture before she starts complaining that sensai isn't teaching her how to make ramen!  And while I realize this movie is a lighthearted take on the fish-out-of-water story, it was so completely unbelievable that I was disappointed I wasted my time on this movie.  The acting was fine, especially the Japanese chef and his wife, but Brittany Murphy's acting was a bit one-note for most of the movie.",1370390400,,1372,4.481927710843373

Her boss is very harsh on her at first, he is a tough, old-fashioned no-nonsense type who rubs her the wrong way. Eventually, she begins to appreciate him (and consider him a father figure), and the story-line goes from there.

(Meanwhile, next to me in bed, my Murphy-loving girlfriend was eating it all up as straight ""drama."" Sigh.)  Ditzy Brittany should have stayed with her Tokyo copyediting job, which apparently consisted primarily of editing bathroom signs, changing ""flash"" to ""flush,"" which is a telling inside joke about the two pejorative ways to view this silly movie.",1359590400,,771,4.840909090909091

Something like a loser, and bereft of obsession and purpose, she rediscovers both when she is inexplicitly drawn to the noodle shop across the street.  She is hungry, but for more than food.  This is NOT Abby's being ""in search of a career"" or her ""deciding"" to make noodles.  It's about redemption.  Abby leaves messages on her boyfriend's phone for awhile, but when Sensei Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida) finally agrees to teach her the art of Ramen and smashes her cell phone, she does not look back.  Abby learns the technique in time, but her Ramen lacks ""spirit."" The sensei's wise old mother tells her she must put love into it.  ""I don't know anything about love ...It disappears... and all that's left is pain and sadness."" Then begin by putting in tears, the old woman tells her.  She means it metaphorically, but a few tears do find their way into the broth and the effects on Abby's first tasting committee are hilarious.  Tsutomu Yamazaki, who was the Yul Brenner type truck driver in Tampopo, did a very funny turn as the doddering Grand Master of Ramen.  Abby acquires an admirer along the way, Toshi (Sohee Park), who is being transferred to Shanghai for 3 years.  He asks her to come with him.  She will not.  Why do you go when you hate the job, she asks him.  Because in my culture one does not put self first, he answers.  It is deliciously ironic that Sensei Maezumi's son put ""self"" before cultural expectations, much to his father's shame, and ran off to Paris; but here is this stubborn girl also obsessed with self who happens to be the one he can't get rid of.

It's not a perfect movie; there was a low budget air about it and for some reason it was not promoted, as if the producers didn't think anybody would go see it anyway.  But you can certainly see Brittany Murphy's talent.  It's a shame about her.  If only she cared for herself the way Abby learned to.  View this rather strange, endearing film as a fable.

This was not about an American girl needing to find ""a new way of life"" because her boyfriend dumped her, nor do I believe the film was ""inspired""  by the film Tampopo, wonderful as it was.  Where Tampopo was sly, Ramen Girl is ingenuous.  Where the cook in Tampopo was motivated by economic necessity, Abby's (Brittany Murphy) attraction to the noodle shop is almost mystical (the maneki neko raises its paw to beckon her to salvation), and in her first bowl of Ramen she is saved.  From then on, her purpose is to master and dispense this cure for the soul--she is a kind girl.  Determined, too, even in the face of rejection by the crusty sansei (Toshiyuki Nishida).  She could go home--her parents offer to send her the ticket--but to what?  A new boyfriend asks her to come with him to Shanghai, and only the year before she was begging the prior boyfriend to let her come with him, but now she has her ""self"" to live up to.  Maybe her quest to make perfect Ramen is a metaphor.  I think it's a comforting little film.  Something about Brittany Murphy's face in sorrow--she really was quite remarkable.  She was one of the producers of this, too, which indicates some taste and vision.  The ambiance of the shabby shop and bleak rainy streets is artistically perfect.  As for the film's portrayal of Japanese culture, read the other 4- and 5-star reviews by persons who have actually lived there.",1348704000,,1425,4.603174603174603

3779058,4,B001RTKKRQ,"Anyone who has been lost in Japan can appreciate this movie - bewilderment about the the world around you, not understanding what people are saying, frustration with the strict Japanese way... It captures that aspect of being a foreigner in a strange land really well. It was a bit contrived, and if you thought about what was happening too deeply you would probably not enjoy it, but it was cute. I thought it really helped to understand Japanese (especially the Osaka-dialect), as you can only get so much meaning from subtitles. But even without any understanding of Japanese, you can still get through the movie and appreciate it.

I wasn't familiar with Brittany Murphy before watching the movie, but she did well playing the ignorant foreigner who insists on breaking through the Japanese barriers. The chef, Toshiyuki Nishida, played the domineering Japanese male to a T. (Yes, it's a stereotype, but there are a lot of grains of truth to the rigidity of older Japanese males and how they expect things to be.) Her blind drive to succeed at something, combined with his inflexible views on how things should be done, drive the movie. Again, if you watch it in the most innocent frame of mind as possible, it's cute. If you are prone to picking apart a movie's faults, you'll probably move on quickly. Appreciate it for what it is - a cute movie about a girl trying to succeed against highly unlikely odds, and learning about herself along the way.

As a sidenote, I found it funny that Thane Camus got credit for his appearance, when his entire role was speaking in Japanese next to Brittany for a few seconds at her office. Funny guy, best known for his English role on Karakuri TV, but unless you paid attention really, really closely you would have missed him.",1341532800,,1770,4.724919093851133

3779060,3,B001RTKKRQ,"After watching this movie, one leaves with the impression a Ramen Noodle dish is an exquisite work of Japanese art. Remember the line where an excited father says the Ramen ""master"" (who always looked like he was ready to pass out) blessed his son's Ramen noodles, and thus the father proclaimed he ""finally"" had a future?

It all sounds good and all, but fact is Ramen dishes originated in China, not Japan, but found migrated over and were domesticated for Japan's population. A serving of ramen is high in carbohydrates and low in vitamins and minerals. Also the soup broth tends to be extremely high in sodium - so it's not exactly a healthy dish. Ramen noodle dishes are not even that popular, comparatively speaking. In Japan, they're not number one (Udon), or even number two (Soba), but take up a distant third among Japanese noodle dishes.

But who'd know any of this watching the movie? Producers probably didn't want the movie would lose all it's cultural ""charm."" Guess that's Hollywood for ya.",1341187200,,1006,4.809248554913295

Here's something funny about this film.... they spent $32 million making it. The same budget as Source Code starring Jake Gyllenhaal, which was a box office blockbuster and went on to make $147 million.. Just goes to show a movie about time travel in an alternate timeline >>>>>>> cooking ramen.

A hot American blonde becomes a ramen chef by
1) cleaning a toilet in a ramen shop in Japan
2) repeating ""I don't understand"" in English to a Japanese guy, who doesn't speak English
3) taking off to New York and opening her own noodle shop, where she puts cucumbers and tomatoes (WTF?!) into ramen, and, of course, the shop does well, because it's Hollywood.

This movie is yet another lie about how you can succeed in a foreign culture without learning its language or customs

Even the cover photo is ignorant and modeled more after kung fu movies, than anything Japanese. That gesture is reserved for just before eating or praying, and she is doing neither. (The hands should be in front of the face, head down, elbows close to the sides.)

Survival strategy for those who have watched it, or are about to watch it despite my attempt to save you:  :::  watch Tampopo ::: It's amazing, funny, instructive, educational, one of the best movies about food, with great actors playing well developed characters, and a ""training sequence"" in cooking, which is almost like a martial art : )",1332547200,7,1121,4.6938775510204085

Its hard not to feel for the characters, and I must say, I thought that the over all story line flowed really nicely. I wouldnt change anything about the movie, and even thought I felt like Brittany Murphy's character could have made more of an effort to actually learn the language lol.

Its a very basic story.. girl comes to Japan, boyfriend leaves her and she is heart broken. Something draws her to a Ramen shop and she decides to learn how to make it. Her teacher speaks no English and wants no student but begrudgingly accepts her in time. The American in turn finds a calling, which she lacked before. The story spans a year.. this is where the makers kind of failed.. I had no idea so much time passed until they just told you outright. And the girl was still not speaking Japanese or even bothered to learn much.. very disappointing.

If this had been an anime.. it would have ROCKED! But as a movie, well they shoudl have made the passing of time more evident.

The engine of her journey is of course ramen making, but it could be anything that one must commit to not just with mind, but with heart to succeed.  There are many wonderful sequences in this film, as when Abby and her grumpy sensei visit his mother to learn to reconnect with cooking from your heart; when the stoic grandmaster passes judgement on Abby's ramen through a series of understated gestures and facial contortions, and when Abby metaphorically ""puts her tears"" into her ramen and, so doing, brings her customers into cathartic states of sobbing.

I really liked this one. I wanted to give this movie 5 stars, but I see there are some plot holes in the movie, and the ending with the chef isn't my cup of tea. But, 4 stars is still pretty awesome as well. Before I actually watched the movie, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie actually surprised me at the end, so I had to give it at least 4 stars.

Brittany Murphy acting was very top notch in this one. I believed that she wanted to really learn how to make ramen and be a student of old chef, Toshiyuki Nishida. She worked really hard putting up with being a student of his: cleaning the pots, the pans, and the bathroom. She had to carry and lug all that heavy stuff around. Then, for her enough, she got to try to make the ramen broth soup. This usually turns out bad and gets dumped. The first attempted wasn't even tasted and straight out dumped. lol

For the rest of the movie, we did get introduced to a few more people. There is a another American guy and girl that were in the movie, but after a few scenes we never saw the guy again with no explanation. Also, with the girl she was shown in a few more scenes, then she wasn't seen again too.

What I didn't like about the movie was that old chef had to retire because he lost the bet he made with the other old chef. Then, Brittany had to go back to America because she could longer work for him. Before Brittany left, there was a scene with the people on the street lifting her up onto a platform and the old chef giving her a japanese lantern. I hated this scene because it showed that Brittany is too above her teacher now. I kept on looking at Brittany face and it looked like she was way over and done with her teacher. The teacher looked sad and about to cry. He really looked like he was reaching for her to show him some kind of respect for him helping her. This was sad I thought.

What surprised me at the end of the movie, Brittany gets her Japanese boyfriend back. I was just expecting Brittany to make her ramen shop and ended like that. But, I wasn't expecting that Japanese guy to come back to her. He seemed too way Japanese to just throw down his whole life and career and go back to Brittany. Him doing that in real life wouldn't happen, but that was a great thing to see for a movie ending. 4 stars!",1316304000,,2304,4.122494432071269

Review in a few lines:
I never much cared for Britanny Murphy but I love foodie movies and I love ramen and the Japanese culture so despite her playing yet another one of her ""I'm a weepy, pouty but sweet and kind hearted gal with spirit"" characters, I really enjoyed the film and put up with her because of the other characters - especially the Ramen Sensei playing the standard ""gruff, surly tyrant who is really a sweetie deep down in side"" character, and because I have a fetish for watching people enjoying a truly good meal. Like any good foodie movie, be aware that after watching this movie you will immediately want to go out and get yourself a bowl of some good authentic ramen noodles.  I should have known better but I just finished watching this movie at 7am in the morning so I'm going to sleep off my hunger pangs and then wake up and immediately run off to my local ramen shop.",1315008000,2,1002,4.376344086021505
3779100,3,B001RTKKRQ,"This movie has a lot of charm and almost won me over in the end, but ultimately, its many flaws proved too great for me to truly recommend it.  If you are capable of extreme suspension of disbelief you may be able to appreciate the good here but it takes a lot.

The story is so rich in potential, it is hard to imagine how it could have gone so wrong.  Murphy's character, Abby, begins as rather shallow and airheaded but the story tracks her growth into a mature and capable young woman, and Murphy plays the part quite capably.  The story is full of narrative about the history and philosophy of certain aspects of Japanese culture (I can't verify if the narrative is factual in its history but it makes for a very interesting story).  The problem is, the mechanics of the story are simply not believable.

Abby, after being abandoned by her boyfriend in about as cold and heartless a manner as one might imagine, decides to stay in Japan in hopes that he will return.  While certainly not a wise decision, that alone is believable enough.  It starts to break down, however, when she decides to dump her job in favor of learning to make Ramen from a man with whom she cannot communicate and who thinks she is a lunatic.  She does this in spite of the fact that her initial experience with the job has her receiving frequent abuse, has her spending all of her time cleaning everything from pots to toilets, and all of this in a situation where she can't even know if she is to be paid anything since she can't speak enough Japanese to even know if he has agreed to hire her in some capacity.  Her ""understanding"" that he will teach her to make Ramen is based upon almost nothing except some hand gestures and a phrase or two from an English/Japanese dictionary or phrasebook.

Her ""teacher"" or ""sensei"" is no more believable -- initially one might guess that he simply chose to exploit Abby's naivet by giving her every crappy job he could think of until she finally got fed up and quit.  Instead, he eventually truly does try to teach her, but given that much of what he tries to teach her is verbal and she doesn't speak Japanese and he doesn't speak English, it seems incredible to imagine that any two people would go through this day after day without one of them deciding that some form of interpreter might be essential to making any further progress.  Somehow, however, we are given to understand that progress is being made anyway, though in the timeline of the movie it seems almost like she spends months getting nowhere and then all at once she is close to success.

While I suspect that the communication barrier was intended to play into the part of the story about the essence of ramen-making being a heart/spirit activity and not a head activity, it just doesn't wash.  Too much here makes no sense, and as wonderful as is much of the acting, and as interesting as the basic tale might be, the illogic of it all kept jumping to the fore, no matter how many times I tried to suppress it.

In spite of its flaws, I gave it three stars because it did come close to winning me over, but I can't quite recommend it.",1306108800,,3128,4.43280977312391

3779111,5,B001RTKKRQ,"This film really catches the essense of life in Japan for a newly arrived gaijin (foreigner).  I lived in the greater Tokyo area for nearly two years, and I've been in plenty of small noodle shops.  The one in this film completely catches the spirit and flavor of those places, and, at the same time the film captures the essence of the Japanese.

It is extremely difficult for most foreigners to understand the mind-set of the Japanese, but the crusty, old, ramen chef protrays it extremely well.  You have to master the technical skill and the art of whatever you do if you are to be successful and find peace and inner harmony.

I loved hearing the Japanese language again, and I'm glad that the decision was made to subtitle the film and have the Japanese characters speak Japanese and the American speak English.  It's been a very long time since I've heard much Japanese, and it was good to hear it again.  And, I remember what it was like when I first arrived in Japan, and could thus empathize completely with the culture shock experienced by the ramen girl.  I wish everyone could have that kind of experience.  After a while, though, even though I knew I would never be able to become totally Japanese, I knew that I could understand and feel the Japanese spirit.

This film is not really about cooking ramen, it is about finding peace and balance within yourself, with others, and with the world...ramen was only the means for telling the story.

It's true that people can teach each other a lot, and it's sad that often Americans think that they have the corner on the market of the best way to do things, because that's certainly not true.  But, when people give and take, the end result can be beautiful and delicious.

3779112,4,B001RTKKRQ,"After being dumped in Tokyo Brittany Murphy seeks a purpose in life by becoming a master ramen chef.  In the process she faces culture clashes and romance problems before finding peace.

This is a strange mix of Japanese and American production values.  Some parts are typical romantic comedy and fish out of water cliches, other times we have typical Japanese stock characters and cliches and subtle jokes that many non-Japanese will miss.  For once the setting actually looks like Tokyo, warts and all, not like a Japanese fairy tale.

The movie also suffered greatly in the editing process, subplots and supporting characters just disappear halfway through.  There's almost a half hour of deleted scenes on my DVD which improve the film greatly.  I assume that like most non-blockbusters the Ramen Girl had be to cut to 90 minutes to allow for more showings in theaters.  It would be greatly improved by a 2 hour director's cut.

That being said, it's better than a lot of America-Japan comedies like Gung-Ho and Mr. Baseball.  Murphy's performance is excellent, she really makes the film work.  Toshiyuki Nishida's performance as a drunken ramen chef is similarly good.

3779117,3,B001RTKKRQ,"This wasn't a bad film & in the memory of Brittany Murphy, I wish I could give it 4 or 5 stars. However, even though it is cute, it isn't a great film.

The film surrounds Abby, a flighty young girl who decides to fly to Tokyo in order to be with her boyfriend. When he dumps her a few weeks later, she's left without any direction or purpose in her life. It's then that Abby discovers a ramen shop outside of her boyfriend's apartment (which she inexplicably remains living in), & after a few meals there, decides that she's going to learn ramen. The path to learning isn't easy, as Abby will soon discover.

This was a cute film & the crown jewel in this film is easily the setting. Tokyo is a beautiful city & the charm of the ramen shop shines throughout the film. Everyone in the film does their best in this film, but in the end even they can't improve what is ultimately a shallow script.

If they'd spent more time building up the secondary characters & developing the romance subplot more, then I think that this would have been a better film. The movie directors try to make Abby's ramen quest the main plotline, which is important- I'm not trying to deny that at all. It's just that like a bowl of ramen- or in ANY dish, you need to pay attention to the accents of the dish. If you don't season it right or if you skip steps, the dish will end up bland & ordinary. I would have liked to see more of the secondary characters of the ramen shop, maybe even show some sort of resolution to their problems. Plus, as another reviewer stated- we never actually see Abby learn how to make ramen broth or noodles. Sure, we see her setting the ingredients in the bowl after everything is cooked, but we never see her learning how to make the noodles or brew the broth. Since it is easy to mess up something as simple as noodles (I've tried making them before, so I can vouch for this), I find it hard to believe that Abby was able to pick up on everything so immediately- ESPECIALLY since she spoke practically no Japanese.

I will also add a small pet peeve of mine. Abby spends the good part of a year there, but learns very little Japanese. She appears to have learned some by the end of the film, but since the film emphasizes her NOT speaking any Japanese, it is a little surprising to see her go from non-fluent to somewhat fluent. This didn't ruin the film at all, but it just made it that much more unbelievable. It would have been nice to see her attempting to learn the language.

Overall, this was a cute & mostly harmless film. I looked at like a bit of junk food. You know that it isn't anything filling, but it is still fun to experience once or twice. It isn't Murphy's strongest film, but it is still pretty cute.",1272758400,,2730,4.2727272727272725
3779118,4,B001RTKKRQ,"Having seen some of the reviews here and elsewhere, I was skeptical and half ready to kill this movie after 10 or 15 minutes.  The performances of the Japanese cast I thought were well done, but Brittany's left a little something to be desired...  She was hit and miss, some scenes she was outstanding, others, just kind of lackluster.  I would've given it two stars since I had no laugh out loud moments, but I, too, was a transplant, an American living in Germany from 1987 through 1991, and my 6 years of Spanish did not do me much good except for when I travelled to Spain...  And this brought back a bit of that nostalgia for me, that fish out of water feeling, because i, too, learned what made me who I am while in a foreign country and not speaking much of the language...  Not that i didn't try, but the younger generation of Germans spoke better english than most Americans I know, so I never had much of a chance to learn more...

She was cute in it, if not consistently inspired or inspiring, and while some of it felt overly contrived, most of it was pretty easy to watch.",1269734400,,1085,4.320197044334975
3779119,4,B001RTKKRQ,"To understand, and ultimately to appreciate, this movie, you MUST have spent more than a little time in Japan.  If you have lived among the Japanese, shared food at their tables, been in their homes, and attempted to learn their language, then you will REALLY enjoy this movie.

To the reviewer who said: ""Moreover, there is one laughably bad scene with Maezumi's wizened mother in which Abby becomes mysteriously fluent in Japanese"" - That comment alone means that you missed the whole movie, the whole point of the movie, and the essence of what that particular scene meant.

I watched this movie by myself, and when done, immediately showed my wife and son THAT particular scene.  I told them before watching it that IF they could truly understand this scene, then they would have an inkling of what it is to understand Japan.  You most obviously missed the point.  I feel sorry for you.

Much has been said about the plot, so I won't rehash that.  I will just say, that if you laugh when you see a wall of vending machines, know what a hyaku-en is, and/or have ever eaten a ""real"" ramen IN JAPAN, then you will most certainly like this movie.",1268784000,2,1146,4.583333333333333
3779120,2,B001RTKKRQ,"Brittany Murphy's untimely death casts a pall over this strictly by-the-numbers 2008 direct-to-DVD comedy. She exudes a certain charm in the title role, an aimless American named Abby, who attempts to master the art of ramen while stuck in Tokyo after her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her, but there is also something vaguely disorienting about her comic performance here. She isn't helped much by the pedestrian direction by Robert Allan Ackerman, best known for his TV-movie work (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-with-Judy-Garland-Me-and-My-Shadows/dp/B00005U8QP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life with Judy Garland - Me and My Shadows</a>) or the derivative script by first-time screenwriter Becca Topol. Neither is able to capture the particular idiosyncrasies of the Japanese culture in a way that would make this fish-out-of-water tale work effectively (like Sofia Coppola did so well in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation/dp/B00005JMJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation</a>). In fact, the clichs and contrivances come fast and furious, so much so that the Tokyo setting becomes rather moot.

The poorly paced storyline has Abby's sudden break-up leading her to a neighborhood ramen shop within view of her unusually large city apartment. She is treated to a bowl of ramen by the shop's curmudgeonly owner/chef Maezumi and his ever-patient wife Reiko. For reasons unexplained, Abby becomes obsessed with learning how to make the ramen even if it means an apprenticeship that amounts to slavery under Maezumi's dictatorial guidance. Predictably, it becomes a contest of wills as to whether Abby will last. The brief scenes showing the ramen preparation may remind some of Juzo Itami's 1985 cult comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tampopo/dp/B000GG4RMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tampopo</a>, and similarities are intentional. However, this film fails to make the time-staking process uniquely appetizing. A romantic subplot is introduced as a disposable diversion, but it's hamstrung by the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Sohee Park, who tepidly plays a young Japanese executive who conveniently needs to move to Shanghai for a three-year assignment. Moreover, there is one laughably bad scene with Maezumi's wizened mother in which Abby becomes mysteriously fluent in Japanese.

All these episodes lead implausibly to a visit from the Master Chef, who will make the final judgment as to whether Abby is ready to succeed Maezumi as a true ramen chef. Veteran Japanese actor Toshiyuki Nishida plays Maezumi as a cross between Danny De Vito at his most anxious and a barking bulldog. Two actors from Yojiro Takita's award-winning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Departures/dp/B002SF9YNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Departures</a>&nbsp;appear here - Kimiko Yo plays a far more traditional role this time as Reiko, and Tsutomu Yamazaki in familiarly taciturn form as the revered Grand Master. His appearance is obviously quite deliberate since he played the Shane-like figure in ""Tampopo"" a quarter century earlier. Impressive as the younger Judy Garland in Ackerman's earlier TV-movie, Tammy Blanchard appears inexplicably as a world-weary American-born bar hostess. But this is Murphy's movie all the way, and her sincere if overly angst-ridden approach seems wasted on such a vacuous story about finding one's place in life, a theme handled with far greater emotional dexterity in ""Departures"". An extended ending, seventeen deleted scenes, and the original theatrical trailer provide the extras on the 2009 DVD.",1268611200,4,3728,6.307843137254902

3779123,4,B001RTKKRQ,"The late Brittany Murphy shines in this heartwarming movie about self-discovery. Abby (Murphy) moves to Japan to be with her boyfriend but when she gets dumped, she finds herself in a fix. Unwilling to return to the States, thinking she still has a chance to make it up with her BF, Abby finds a new purpose in the ramen place across the street from her apartment. One rainy night, a despondent Abby wanders into the ramen shop after closing, and starts weeping. The chef Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida) and his wife are puzzled as they can't speak English and Abby can't converse in Japanese, so they offer some ramen to comfort her. It does that and more - inspired by the wonderful taste of the ramen, Abby is seized by a sudden desire to learn how to cook ramen, and like an annoying gnat, keeps harassing the chef until he finally takes her on as his apprentice - but not without giving her a really hard time (Abby's initial duties include cleaning the kitchen and the dirty toilets as well as waiting on tables).

The heated exchanges between Abby and Maezumi make for great entertainment- Maezumi as played by Nishida is an irascible taskmaster, who hides a lot of pain beneath his prickly demeanor. Abby, portrayed brilliantly by Murphy, is an initially naive, lost soul trying to find a purpose in life, and struggles to adapt to a foreign environment - not speaking Japanese doesn't help either. There is also a cast of secondary characters, such as the American woman who works as a call girl/mistress, the handsome, young Japanese executive who forms a relationship with Abby, the chef's wife, and a few eccentric regulars at the ramen place. The story does not get overly sappy, and the story, though predictable, is not without a couple of twists. The story might not be original, but it certainly is well-cast and the leads make this an engaging watch. I took away one star because I felt some of the secondary characters deserved more development, e.g. the call girl/mistress who just disappears half-way through the movie. On the whole, this is an interesting, and uplifting drama about searching for one's path in life, and showcases Brittany Murphy's acting talents to good effect. The movie is in both Japanese and English, with a lot of Japanese dialogue accompanied by English subtitles.

It is very realistic and true to life if an American would cook ramen in Japan.  The personalities of the shop owners are portrayed to the ""T""  The humor is true to life as well.  You don't need to have lived in Japan to understand and appreciate that their culture is not unlike this movie portrays.  The wife wanting to become close to Abbey and siding with her and the shop owner and his tough exterior, drinking habits and loathe of Abbey in the beginning shows that most older Japanese men truely do not show their emotions and are very guarded with them as well as their secrets.  Once you get to know the charactors and understand them the appreciation for this movie grows by leaps and bounds.  Even in this day and age to befriend a Japanese national you must prove yourself to the fullest extent humanly possible and once you have broken the ice you have a friend/family for a lifetime.

After relocating to Japan and being dumped by her boyfriend, Abby (Murphy) drowns her sorrows at a local Ramen shop.  Delighted by the traditional dish of noodles, vegetables and pork, Abby resolves to learn how to cook the meal herself...triggering an hilarious battle of wills with her reluctant ""sensei"" (Toshiyuki Nishida) in the process!

Beautifully filmed on location in Japan, THE RAMEN GIRL is an adorable movie and Ms Murphy does a lovely job in the lead.  On the downside, Becca Topol's screenplay is rather disjointed, peppered with too many characters who start off strong but seem to go nowhere (Tammy Blanchard as Gretchan, Daniel Evans as Tom, etc.).

Only when she visits a local ramen shop does she discover something she enjoyes doing, despite her tyrannical teacher's dislike for her.  Her persistence pays off over the course of the movie, as the other characters begin to appreciate her.

I did watch the alternate ending in the Special Features too and think the right decision was made to use the one that was included with the movie. I really love watching Brittany Murphy - she's cute, a great funny girl, serious when she needs to be.

Now  alone in a foreign culture where she doesn't speak the language she wanders into a little ramen shop in search of a little nourishment for both body and soul. All appears lost until that first taste of ramen prepared by the abrasive chef Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida). Within moments everything has changed and her life's path discovered. And what is that path, ramen. Unfortunately Maezumi has no interest in training a new apprentice, specially a talkative, overzealous American girl who won't take no for an answer. Then of course the fact that neither of them speaks the same language doesn't help matters either.

Will Abby's dream be fulfilled or will Maezumi eventually convince her that she's doesn't possess the inner harmony to fully comprehend the profound nature of ramen. It's a tale of east meets west, male versus female, loss and acceptance, and so much more.

Critique: I was totally surprised that I liked, correction loved this film. Why you might ask? Because I am not a fan of Brittany Murphy (nothing personal Brittany). However the wonderful, unique story-line, the magical atmosphere of the ramen shop and the stellar performances of Toshiyuki and Brittany (YES, Brittany I admit it) kept me entranced from beginning to end. The film is reminiscent of another wonderful film, 'Mistress of Spices.' The similarity is found not in the story-lines but the exotic, mystical atmosphere created for the spice store and ramen shop.

Definitely an enjoyable watch delivering lots of energy, strong humorous elements and a subtle mix of pathos that elevates the film to the status of something more than just a pleasant comedy.

Brittany Murphy as a woman in her 20s trying to find her way in life was a great character.  She follows her non-committal boyfriend to Tokyo where he abandons her in a movie that although echoing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation/dp/B00005JMJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation</a>, has a better story to tell.

The first time, she is magically drawn to it.  The interaction between her, the owners and patrons of this place are the best part of this film.

She decides to become a great Ramen Noodle cook, which is a difficult task to master.  The fact that there is a huge language barrier makes it more difficult. The plot of this movie is absorbing and commands the viewers attention.

Somehow, all the great parts (fascinating characters, solid plot, absorbing western meets eastern tale) do not equal a great movie overall.  There was something missing from the finished film that crushed my initial high expectations.",1253923200,,1493,5.971830985915493
3779132,2,B001RTKKRQ,"My experience tells me that it is not a good sign if a film with a big-name star receives only a limited theatrical release before disappearing without a trace. The star I am talking about is NOT Brittany Murphy - though she is top-billed in ""The Ramen Girl"" - it is Japanese actor Toshiyuki Nishida. The respected veteran is famous for his hugely successful movie franchise ""Tsuribaka Nisshi,"" but perhaps some might remember him as the ""Pigsy"" of Japanese TV series ""Monkey."" Despite his name, the film never received wide theatrical release in Japan. This is quite unusual - imagine a Tom Hanks movie released only in LA and you know what I mean - and the reason is simple. ""The Ramen Girl"" is not very good.

Brittany Murphy is Abby, who has followed her boyfriend Ethan (Gabriel Mann) from America. Ethan leaves her, however, and shocked Abby is attracted to the bright light nearby her apartment room. It is a small ramen shop run by a headstrong master Maezumi (Nishida), and Abby, looking for a new way of life, decides to work at the shop to learn the art of cooking. Naturally Maezumi refuses, but persistent Abby wouldn't leave and the shop master reluctantly agrees.

Certainly the storyline is forced, but not without potential. I don't think stubborn master like Maezumi, who has been doing his job for more than forty years, would take Abby (or anyone else, American or not) as a pupil so easily, but Nishida is a talented actor, very good at comedy, so the film still had a chance.

Alas, the director never allows him to do what he can do. Not surprisingly, grumpy Maezumi yells at Brittany Murphy's Abby, who is not a fast learner, but the film is no fun to watch as it lacks humor and pathos that this kind of story needs. This is not the wall-painting training of wise Miyagi-san in ""The Karate Kid"" which has a meaning in it. Maezumi's pointless ""training"" (like Abby scrubbing a toilet bowl) doesn't convince us.

Abby's character is also a problem. The idea of a broken-hearted American woman who wants to learn ramen cooking is not very credible. Moreover, the film never gives her a real trial. It takes a lot of effort and tenacity to acquire skills of ramen cooking (or any kind of cooking for that matter), but the dialogue-ridden film never gives her a chance to show her cooking prowess. What she has to learn is explained away simply with a word ""tamashii"" or soul. And a teardrop, too.

""The Ramen Girl"" is helmed by Brooklyn-born Emmy-winning director Robert Allan Ackerman, who has also directed plays in Tokyo many times. The film's screenplay is written by Becca Topol, who, according to the film's home page, spent one year in Japan while studying in college. As to the production design of the ramen shop and the owner's house, it is perfect. You can find such small ramen shops around the corner anywhere in Japan.

However, the film, it seems, misses every opportunity to use their knowledge about the country and its culture. Cooking ramen plays a significant role as metaphor in the film, but in ""The Ramen Girl"" somehow you don't see the details of ramen cooking they should know. How did Abby learn the skills? How did the master teach her?

There is nice supporting acting from Kimiko Yo as Maezumi's wife, and Tsutomu Yamazaki as the grand ramen master (both actors seen in ""Departures""), but the lagging pace of the film doesn't change. Subplots about the characters played by Tammy Blanchard and Sohee Park are so weak and forgettable.

The film needs a more capable director and writer, who can create a cinematically dynamic narrative development, or more credible story and characters. This is s huge disappointment for me. ""The Ramen Girl"" could have been a much more engaging drama with someone else as director. Toshiyuki Nishida, one of the best actors in Japan, deserves a better film than this.

By the way, there is really a ""Ramen Museum"" in Yokohama.",1253232000,31,3910,4.721407624633431

I rented this film.  And for my 5 bucks I was decently entertained.  It wasn't a fantastic film experience that will change your life or anything like that.  But it was an entertaining movie.

The main character is a disaster of a human being who has no real purpose in life.  She eventually finds purpose by visiting a local ramen shop and seeing how a simple bowl of soup is capable of bringing joy to people.  She finally decided to finish something she's started for the first time in her life and becomes a dedicated student to a ramen chef.

I found the main character to be somewhat unconvincing.  She seemed a bit too aloof and unrealistic for my tastes.  The entertaining vs. annoying was drawn upon racial lines.  All the japanese characters were interesting and/or amusing, while the white characters were neither entertaining nor believable.

I did enjoy the fact that most of the japanese characters spoke japanese.  All too often in films the fluency of english is exaggerated because many an audience is too lazy to read subtitles.  And I also enjoyed that Murphy speaks a minimum of japanese and her employer speaks minimum english.  The struggle to understand each other with a dictionary and pantomime seemed real.

The lead actress, Brittany Murphy did not seem as natural or convincing in comparison but she gave an acceptable performance. The lead character's ex-pat friends were basically cardboard cut-outs, but they didn't really matter to the story so the movie still worked. It felt like the director could have done a bit more with this movie (made it longer, added more detail), but it would have required much more subtlety from Brittany Murphy. Instead he chose to rush the lead character's development and paint it with primary colors and relied on the Japanese cast to hold up the movie (and they were up to the task).

3779136,1,B001RTKKRQ,"The long and short of it: Don't waste your time. Acting is terrible, plot line is nonsense, and premise for a movie is lacking.

SPOILER ALERT

I'm not sure who should be more offended after watching this movie; caucasian expats, japanese people, or those with an IQ level above 90.

Brittany Murphy plays the main character Abby, and I'm not sure if the audience is supposed to feel bad for her stupidity, or if we're supposed to hate what she embodies in an American example. Her character is extremely hard to like, portraying American expats (and Americans in general) as shallow, silly, and moronic. Her boyfriend leaves her, and she (as expected) falls into a deep despair, fulfilling the stereotype of the typical dependent girlfriend who is ""helpless"" without her man. Her character is so infantile, idiotic and pitiable (in a sad way) that it's hard to stomach her antics.

One night, the wind blows mysteriously through Abby's apartment, leading her to the ramen shop across the street. In what seemed to be some kind of bizarro love scene, Murphy's character falls into some kind of trance and decides she MUST learn to make ramen.

Her ""sensei"", who agrees to teach her ramen noodle making, speaks only japanese. Abby speaks only English. For at least the first half of the movie, it might as well be monolouges as Britney Murphy rambles on in English to someone who only speaks Japanese, and vice versa. Neither understand each other, but somehow they find the ability to stare at each other while the other one rambles on.

The depiction of American expats is nothing short of ridiculous and completely asinine. As an expat myself, I found this stereotype to be way off base, and not even slightly funny. One expat is hooking for a living. What???????? In my 10 years overseas, I must have missed the part about expats falling into prostitution (abusive prostitution at that). I really cringe for all expats that watch this movie.

I honestly cannot say enough about how horrible this movie was. Please, spare yourself. I'm just curious who Britney Murphy is related to, or in a relationship with, that could have possibly resulted in her starring in a movie. There is no way she'd actually be hired on her acting ability alone.",1247961600,15,2242,4.8077922077922075

- Great acting

- Great use of the language barrier: I love the fact that it never disappears, yet mutual understanding sets in; I love the realism with which the actors react to each other's speech - in fact I wondered if they improvised and did not in fact know what the other actor was saying.
- Good nuance to the main character
- They should have showed Abby becoming a ramen chef in more detail
- They should have focused on the old chef's story more

3779140,2,B001RTKKRQ,"I watched The Ramen Girl because Amazon recommended the movie to me based upon my various viewing history.  I saw the little video blurb on the product screen and was interested enough to borrow the title from a friend.  I'm glad I borrowed instead of bought - this movie was horrid.

The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is the Japanese cast.  Toshiyuki Nishida gives a stellar performance as the ""grumpy old man"" stereotype while Kimiko Yo adds a nice touch of heart in playing the loving wife. Nishida did have quite a few lines in the movie which had me laughing, but unfortunately the rest of the movie was poorly written and the acting ability of the leading star left much to be desired.  Hikari Okada as the old mother was a very heartfelt touch - too bad the scene was ruined by Murphy.  Tsutomu Yamazaki's cameo as the Grand Master of ramen was a very nice nod to the Goro character of Tampopo as well.

Imagine taking the base story that is Tampopo - the urge to find and make the best bowl of ramen that you can - and then dumping in a giant dose of ""Generic American Romantic comedy plot #01"".  While Tampopo made you feel for the characters and the possibility of a perfect bowl of ramen made by a chef of such skill that it made the eater find a little bit of true happiness at the end of the bowl, The Ramen Girl bludgeons you over the head with it and attempts to tell you that a bowl of ramen can make you physically cry or laugh out loud, depending on the skill of the chef.  Subtlety is obviously not in the director's (or Brittany Murphy's) reppitoire.

On the foodie side of the house, I was even more disappointed.  There was no talk about the ingredients, the time or heart it took to make the perfect bowl of ramen.  The deepest that this movie got was to say ""Cook from your heart, not your head!""  While that line (or similar) work for many foodie movies, it doesn't work when it's the only piece of advice offered through the entire film.

There are also 501 subplots in this movie that have zero relation or resolution to the main trunk of the story.  There's the boyfriend which disappears after the first 15min of the movie, never to be seen or heard from again.  There's the original job, which she apparently leaves with no notice - but is able to keep her apartment without getting paid for a month.  There's the hooker and the homosexual drunk - the hooker which is a sorry attempt at playing a mirroring device vehicle for Murphy's character, and the homosexual drunk which appears to serve no purpose at all except for maybe comedic interlude (which he fails at).  There's the ""rival"" ramen maker and the ramen Grand Master challenge - neither of which actually flesh out to be anything substantial, but they sure do get built up like it might be.  The two ladies who lack happiness and the love-lost boy-who-doesn't-have-a-chance-with-the-hot-American-girl.  Yes, all that is packed into the movie for no apparent rhyme or reason to most of them.  Oh, apparently the ramen chef has a son - but it's ok, everything is magically made better by the end of the movie.

I can only recommend this movie if you're seriously jonesing for a fix of Japan.  This isn't a movie for a foodie nor for a serious Asian cinema fan.  This movie is the equivalent of watching the Richard Gere version of ""Shall we dance?"" and comparing it to the original Japanese version.  Except with much lower production values and acting ability.  I am being serious when I say you could have replaced Brittany Murphy's entire dialogue in this movie with her oft-repeated phrase, ""I don't understand,"" and you wouldn't have lost much at all.

If you've watched this movie and you haven't seen Tampopo, go see it and you'll understand how this movie should have been made.",1246838400,7,3800,4.517543859649122
3779141,3,B001RTKKRQ,"This movie is less about the culture and cuisine of Japan but more about Brittany Murphy having an emotional breakdown.  It's also censored for language which you may either appreciate or find annoying.  I was also disappointed with the film's ending.  Abby does not win the master chef's approval when she creates an American fusion dish- ramen made with corn, tomato, and peppers in addition to the traditional ingredients, straying from the traditional recipe.  Also you never get to see her wearing a kimono like the cover art suggests.",1245801600,3,540,5.033707865168539
3779142,4,B001RTKKRQ,"Ramen Girl follows the familiar pattern of somebody in their mid-20s who is lost in life and finds herself in a foreign country. In this case, the finding is odd. Brittany Murphy's character finds her calling in ramen. In particular, she wants to learn how to cook the perfect bowl of Ramen. She asks a Japanese chef who speaks no English to teacher her, an American who speaks no Japanese, how to make Ramen.

The movie was actually pretty funny. It includes frequent scenes of a Ramen master slapping Murphy on the head for being a bad student. It definitely works as a lighthearted date movie. However, overall it did seem a bit chopped up and hasty. It seems as if some key plot developments were skipped over or overlooked. For example, it never is really clear just when Murphy learns how to cook Ramen. Also, throughout the movie, I kept wondering why nobody ever bothered to get a translator who could sort out the mess. Despite this, you'll probably get a few laughs out of their arguments.",1245628800,,999,4.612359550561798
