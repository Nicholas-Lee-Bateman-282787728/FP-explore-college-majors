7795244,5,0983950512,"I purchased and returned this DVD twice.  Each time it came in a very cheap DVD case so that it was loose and moving about freely in the case and was scratched.  The little of it that I did get to see was a very poor quality copy.  Such a shame - it's content would be valuable to our groups.

ADDENDUM: I've since received a new copy of the video ""Men and Their Grief""  It's been a valuable addition to our library of grief resources. It helps men see firsthand that they are not alone in their feelings. It is worth noting as well, that there is a follow up video ""Men and Their Grief 20 Years Later"" that follows these men through their grief journey.",1388966400,,654,4.158730158730159
