8219179,5,B000VKKV2Q,"Takes the human ancestral connection to the max.  And who better than Charlotte Rampling to tell us what she thinks of the modern homo sapiens male?  Being a 'French' farce doesn't hurt either, considering the fantastic number of self-indulgent French male actors in past similar roles --- could also reference Natalie Baye for reversing male-female roles in 'extra' affairs --- could go on and on ---",1436572800,,401,5.0606060606060606
8219180,3,B000VKKV2Q,"Okay, I admit it: I'll watch anything with Charlotte Rampling in it. She's got an incomparable elegance and the most hypnotic eyes of any actor. But I guess I missed the reason for her obsession with Max. Given her husband's lack of appreciation for her, I could understand any number of kinds of affairs. But why a chimpanzee? Nevertheless, the sheer absurdity of it combined with my inability to figure out what was going to happen next and how the thing was going to end kept me tuned in. I'll show it to a select group of friends and hope they don't pelt me with rotten fruit.",1419292800,,580,4.429906542056075
8219181,4,B000VKKV2Q,"This 1986 film co-written and directed by Oshima stars Charlotte Rampling, Anthony Higgins and Victoria Abril.  The American poster claims ""a love triangle of primate proportions."" Is this the greatest ape/human love story since Kong and his American girl friend's tragic tale?  Absolutely.  But this disturbing romance - if it can be called that and I think it can -- about a British diplomat (Higgins) in France whose wife (Rampling) takes a chimpanzee, Max, for her lover lives up to -- and goes beyond --the not so subtle hype of poster and DVD box.  Is this a farce or a satire about how difficult relationships can be?  Maybe and maybe not.  What it does is present an outrageous situation in the most understated and ordinary terms.  I was reminded of the best of Buuel's works and discovered a writer, producer and an actor were frequent collaborators with the sublime master.",1319328000,5,884,4.8533333333333335
