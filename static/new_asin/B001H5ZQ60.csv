8307914,3,B001H5ZQ60,"""Props: Vol 2"" is a short and fast paced workout at about 32 and a half minutes.  Many of the exercises were easy, with a few challenging ones.

Here are the 3 props or equipment required.

1. Flex band (thin and long stretchie, not the round rubber tubing)
2. Fitness circle resistance ring (also known as the Magic Circle)
3. Two toning balls (small, light-weight balls)

Moira Merrithew and John Garey alternate as instructors and both demonstrate.  They are the two little figures on the bottom right of the cover.  (These two should be more prominently displayed on the cover rather than the young woman and man who are not in the workout.)

Instruction and exercises did not flow as smoothly as it should have because the props and the instructors were constantly changing throughout the workout.  The instructors were not always harmonious and the exercise sequencing needed improvement.  On a positive note, it is a decent workout and I did see a few variations of certain exercises.

8307915,4,B001H5ZQ60,The workout is about 35 minutes.  It goes by very fast.  I wouldn't call it intermediate though I'd say it's more of a beginners workout with strength training built into it to keep it more interesting.  I find a lot of Stott Pilates workouts a bit slow in progression this one was faster which was a good surprise.,1288915200,2,315,4.396551724137931
8307916,5,B001H5ZQ60,"I definitely recommend this DVD! I tried this workout for the first time this morning and am in love! I have been doing pilates regularly for almost 6 years now (mostly Winsor Pilates, but have recently branched into Stott Pilates for some variation) and have started adding props to challenge my workout. Usually Stott Pilates is a bit slow paced for my liking, but this workout quickly moved from one exercise to the next! (Definitely woke me up quickly for my 6am workout.) And, the exercise were challenging and had new aspects that my other Stott Pilates DVDs do not have. (I also have several of the strecth-band workouts and magic-circle workouts by Stott and Winsor.) The instructors had you switch among the band, circle, and toning balls throughout the workout, mixing it up and prohibiting bordom. (I love what pilates does for my body, but sometimes it can get boring.) The DVD contains a great combination of workouts. I have not tried ""Stott's Pilates with Props vol. 1"" and even though it may be easier than vol. 2, I think I will purchase it next because vol. 2 was so much fun!  Best Stott Pilates video yet!",1228780800,10,1125,4.681818181818182
