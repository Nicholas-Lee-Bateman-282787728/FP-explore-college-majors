8221494,5,B000W7LLIQ,"Chet Baker was someone I kind of passed over in my "" education "" of jazz. I wrote him off as just a "" pretty boy playing a trumpet"".
Boy, did I get that wrong. I purchased my first cds with Chet, and I realized how wrong I was. Then I got the Jazz Icons with Chet
Baker, and I had to see and hear more. So, in getting this one, it only re-enforced my appreciation for Chet Baker. This is one of
those delightful performances that is in and intimate setting, that really focuses on the interaction and nuance of the playing. You can
really understand how playing in close quarters and being able to focus on what they are doing, really inspires them. Now many of
you have concerts at big venues have this large audience and many people you can see are really not interested in the music. They
just happened to be there, or they were just killing time. I have been at casino venues, where people are walking back and forth right
around seating area, and it's distracting sometimes to me, think how it must, at least at times, break a musicians concentration.",1405814400,,1056,4.338383838383838
8221495,5,B000W7LLIQ,"Rhythm, beat, sound, tempo are incredibly fine tuned for this informal living room session.  What's impressive most is that there is no drummer!  The pianist and bassist carry the weight of the percussion and they do this flawlessly.  In a normal trio or quartet setup, the bass is just ""felt"" along with the steady rhythm.  However, this format leads to an appreciation of the bass by enabling the listener to focus on each note through unique tempo and key changes.
Chet's playing is ""hitting on a cylinders"" in this session.  He looks good and it is obvious that he is full of ""natural"" energy.  Fans of Baker know his history with drugs, but I get the feeling in this session, he is completely clean and the music that is delivered is a reward.
My favorite tune is ""Love For Sale"".  The rhythm/beat is modern, even by today standards).  I applaud Chet for taking the ""Cool Jazz"" sound to a different level at this point.  I recommend this DVD to anyone that loves Jazz and particularly to those that are not familiar with Chet Baker.",1364515200,3,1037,4.592391304347826
8221496,5,B000W7LLIQ,"This dvd, recorded in the last year or two of Chet Baker's life, is a good example of his music acttually reaching even a higher level than in his early years.",1361836800,3,159,4.161290322580645
8221497,5,B000W7LLIQ,"This was shot in the Sonet Record library (Sweden) a year before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHET-BAKER-LIVE-AT-RONNIE-SCOTT-S/dp/B000JJSKWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHET BAKER LIVE AT RONNIE SCOTT'S</a>&nbsp;was shot. Michel Grailler, here on piano, was also Chet's accompanist on that video.

What sets this video apart is the informality - it truly is as though shot in a living room - and the small talk among musicians between songs.  While there is an informality (and intimacy), the music itself is not shortchanged. Each musician pours his heart and soul into each selection.

It is interesting is how much younger and vibrant Chet is here - a year later at Ronnie Scott's he appeared to have aged considerably.

The set list is eclectic to say the least, ranging from bebop (Tempus Fugue-It and Nardis) to a Cole Porter tune (Love for Sale). The entire list is: Candy, Love for Sale, Tempus Fugue-It, Sad Walk, Red's Blues, Nardis, Bye Bye Blackbird and My Romance.

Baker fans will love this performance, and die hard fans will appreciate the intimate setting that somehow makes you feel as though you are setting in a chair in the room enjoying the music and company.  I also strongly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chet-Baker-At-Le-Dreher-1980/dp/B0051GSMBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chet Baker At Le Dreher 1980</a>.",1335830400,8,1433,6.069306930693069
8221498,5,B000W7LLIQ,"This video really pleased me.  It was filmed in 1985, just a few years before Chet's death.  Here he's just hanging out, playing music, and taking it all in.  The whole affair is very relaxed.  The musicians sound great and the film makers keep it simple.  Chet also sings a little in the course of the 8 songs here.  The other members of the trio, Michel Graillier on piano and Jean-Louis Rassinfosse on bass, get a generous amount of screen time as well.  Chet is mainly shown in close-up, which is ok since he's slumped in a chair most of the time.  There's a brief segment where he is interviewed by Red Mitcheln then the two play the final song, ""My Romance"" together.

If you like Chet, you WILL like this video.  I wasn't a big fan of the interview segment, but the trumpet-playing sounds great.  I've always liked Chet's later singing style, and it's fine here.  Chet's life was a mess, but this video plays it straight - 55 minutes of Chet and the music.",1329091200,,963,4.409090909090909
8221499,5,B000W7LLIQ,Thirty great minutes of Chet Baker playing and being interviewed  by bassist Red Mitchell-passed on recently.  Not really an interview but a sit down and rap with Red Mitchell.  You also enjoy a very fine bass player and appreciate jazz piano artist Michel Graillier who is very under-rated and seldom seen on film.  Chet plays and sings in his inimatable bluesy style on the world's hardest to play instrument.  You strike a piano key and a hammer strikes a wire string and you get a note.  How trumpeters even breath much less trill a buzzing lip into any sound at all with an embouchure that is so hard to form-try it!  Very enjoyable relaxin' with dear old Chet. Nothing against Chris Botti but there was nothing like the real Chet Baker.,1245283200,,742,4.6183206106870225
