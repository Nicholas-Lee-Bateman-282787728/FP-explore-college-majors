8705540,4,B00UFADI5O,I first saw this series on television here in the UK and immediately thought what a brilliant series. As you can only get the Spanish version with Spanish subtitles for the hard of hearing in Europe you can imagine how delighted I was to see the bluray on Amazon USA with the description saying it had English and Spanish subtitles. So I decided to purchase it only to discover after receiving it that there are NO subtitles what so ever on the discs. the series itself deserves 5 stars but with the disappointment of the subtitles issue I only gave it 4 stars.,1463011200,6,561,4.456310679611651

8705542,5,B00UFADI5O,"Isabel was a queen of queens.  This is a fascinating story of a remarkable woman.  Isabel is strong, wise, loving, and passionate in her beliefs. The spanish mini series has recovered one of the most fascinating characters of european history and it happens to be a female one.  The cinematography is splendid.  Actors are perfect.  Once you start watching, you won't be able to stop.  It has all the elements that make up for a great story: love, jealousy, betrayals, loss, victory...and at the same time is a journey trough historical turning points.  One of the best mini series I have watched.",1452124800,5,597,4.794117647058823
