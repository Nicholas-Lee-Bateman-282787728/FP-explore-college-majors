7320680,4,B0112HPX1K,"This movie was on Hallmark channel and I missed it, so I bought the DVD when it came out. I enjoyed the clean story of two opposites working together at the same job and falling in love. It isn't my favorite Hallmark Christmas movie by far (Snow Bride, Let it Snow, Nine Lives of Christmas and Cookie Cutter Christmas are better) but it's still good for the warm fuzzies you want from a Christmas movie.",1445558400,4,403,4.386666666666667
7320681,5,B0112HPX1K,you will like this Christmas movie because its the best Christmas party ever all the actors are very good in this movie so set back an enjoy it.,1444694400,,144,4.178571428571429
7320682,4,B0112HPX1K,I saw this on Hallmark Channel last year  Torrey Devitto is very pleasing to the eye. Cant say she is much of an actress but who cares.. The plot is good not exactly rocket science but it will keep your attention.. Hallmark in the last few years has come out with some very good movies.. This is a good movie  I will buy it myself to add to my already huge collection of Hallmark movies. I recommend this one to anyone who likes a good story with a good ending for Christmas,1443744000,5,474,4.141304347826087
7320683,5,B0112HPX1K,"Best Christmas Party Ever is another wonderful feel-good movie from the Hallmark Channel.  Watching the Countdown to Christmas line-up is a tradition at our house and each year the movies are better than ever before.  I like to spend the entire time between Thanksgiving and Christmas getting into the holiday spirit and watching Hallmark movies from prior years has become part of our holiday plan.

In this movie, Jennie Stanton (Torrey DeVitto) is a party planner who is expecting to take over her bosses business, Petra's Parties, now that Petra (Linda Thorson) is planning on retiring.  What she doesn't expect is that Petra is giving into nepotism and putting her inexperienced (but oh, so good looking and kind) nephew, Nicky (Steve Lund), in charge of the business.

Jennie has a lot of problems with this and tries her best to one-up everything that Nicky suggests.  The big deal of the day is the community party that Tyrell's Toys is famous for holding.  Jennie is determined to get the job and put on the traditional party (which really was part of what shaped her life as a youngster.)  The man she is now dating, Todd Perry (Harmon Walsh), is a slightly slimy executive at Tyrell's and he, along with the new owners of that company, want to change from traditional to something completely different.  Jennie has her hands full trying to outsmart Nicky and battle to make the party the best ever.

The movie progresses pretty much as expected with lots of battles and repartee between Jennie and Nicky, while the chemistry between the two becomes undeniable. Will they continue to fight their way through the movie or will they learn to work together and make the most of the talents that each bring to the table?

I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was a little bit silly in spots but lots of fun for the family to watch together.  I'm a big fan of Hallmark movies.  They are the type of entertainment you can enjoy with your parents and with your kids without cringing over off-color jokes and innuendos.  I recommend it for all ages and for those who enjoy sweet and happy movies.",1440892800,18,2103,4.723287671232876
7320684,4,B0112HPX1K,"What I love about the Hallmark Channel is that it doesn't give an ef about being cool because it would rather dabble in warmth. It's a family-oriented network that's more concerned with its viewing audience than its critics. Its programming is always stuff that you can just watch with the fam without fretting about awkward, inappropriate moments that may come up during the show. I am loving its now traditional Countdown to Christmas lineup. Best Christmas Party Ever is one of twelve holiday movies that Hallmark put out for 2014 as part of that lineup, and I enjoyed it, man.

The premise is similar to Hats Off To Christmas in which the employee up for promotion gets submarined by nepotism. Jennie Stanton (Torrey DeVitto) is a dedicated event planner who had assumed she's being groomed to take over Petra's Parties. But when Petra (Linda Thorson) announces she's retiring, she instead taps her actor nephew Nick Forbes (Steve Lund) as the heir apparent and asks Jennie to train him. Jennie and Nick instantly clash over what theme to design for a senior arts center event. And then comes their first big challenge: organizing the grandest bash of the holiday season for the venerable Tyrell's Toys company, the very same toy store that inspired Jennie as a young girl to become an event planner. Can Jennie's severe work ethic and by-the-books methods mesh with Nick's cockiness and off-the-wall ideas? And will bottom-line corporate interests crush the Christmas spirit and undermine Jennie's intent to make the Tyrell's Toys Christmas Eve party the best time ever for a struggling community? Jennie talks about Tyrell's tradition of toy drives and hot turkey dinners for those in need. She argues: ""Tyrell's Toys parties is about inclusion and community, not about VIP rooms and wrist bands."" The suit who represents the corporation that just bought out Tyrell's Toys (and whom Jennie is dating) rebuts with ""Sometimes, to maintain the old, you have to incorporate a little new."" Yeah, sounds fishy to me, yo.

Well, this is a Hallmark movie, not an Agatha Christie joint, so the outcome's never really in doubt. Hallmark's all about the journey and the warmth of the story and the showcasing of universal values. And while critics and some fans may turn up their noses because Hallmark cinema is always so ""bland"" and ""predictable,"" the numbers demonstrate that there's a huge market for its brand of cozy, sappy entertainment.

I will say that I wasn't at first sure about Nick. I thought, initially, that, hey, there's a guy who isn't nearly as charming as he thinks he is. But Steve Lund plays him as a stand-up guy with enough down-to-earth warmth, after all, that I eventually caved. Although that one joke, ugh: ""What do you get when you cross a vampire with a snowman?"" ""Frost bite."" And, honestly, that I was cagey around Nick is a nod to how immediately likable I found Jennie. Torrey DeVitto plays her as a stern taskmaster but with a kind and vulnerable soul. The squabbling between DeVitto and Lund goes down in cliched fashion. We know the suit she's dating doesn't have a chance. We know Petra's Parties will land the prestigious Tyrell's Toys account (or do we?). And that Jennie and Nick will end up throwing the best Christmas party ever. I saw everything coming, and I still couldn't take my eyeballs off the screen. And I felt the same way about Hat's Off To Christmas (which, by the way, I'm still waiting to come out on DVD).",1440288000,11,3458,4.837837837837838

7320966,5,B0112HPX1K,I loved the rivalry between the boss's nephew and her assistant.  It wasn't hard to see that the rivalry brought out emotions that ended up in love.  I loved the Nutcracker theme for the Christmas party. It has been one of my favorites since my youth.  I thought the story line was done very well and the actors for each role were perfect.  I would and have recommended this movie to others.  It will be one that I watch over and over again.,1454198400,2,441,4.265060240963855

7321033,5,B0112HPX1K,"Best Christmas Party Ever is about a woman named Jennie Stanton (Torrey DeVitto) who is a event party planner.  Jennie believes that she is a shoe in for a promotion  when she hears her boss, Petra (Linda Thorson) decides to retire.  But Petra decides to give her job to her nephew, Nick  Forbes (Steve Lund).  At first Jennie is real disappointed by Petra's decision. After a while Jennie and Nick start working as a team.  Suddenly Nick founds out he got a role in a soap opera and decides to leave. You would think Jennie would be happy about the news but she is not. Watch this movie to see if Nick actually goes or does he stay.  Enjoy!",1449100800,,641,4.336134453781512
7321034,4,B0112HPX1K,"Interesting.  The main character (Torrey DeVitto as Jennie Stanton) is put forth as an expert party-planner, the best in the business.  And yet.  When paired with a complete novice (Steve Lund as Nick Forbes), all her ideas fizzle and he proves more adept at doing her job than she does!  Makes one wonder just how good she was before he came along to fix everything.

The boo-hoo part of the story involves Jennie being passed over for promotion when her boss (the fabulous Linda Thorson) gives the business to her nephew instead.  He is family.  He is an actor who doesnt know beans about the business.  But he is quite good at it because he has personality and pizzazz while shes just fussy.  At one point he humiliates her while hes doing tricks at a bar.  As we all know, humiliation is one of the finer points to any good romance.  Meanwhile, she scorns and ridicules him because that too leads the way to a great romance.  When he takes over one of her accounts can a wedding be far behind!

Sheesh.  Can I have at least one romance where the couple doesnt start out going for each others throat!!!  They eventually flirt over hotdogs.  They eat an inordinate number of hotdogs over the course of this movie.",1449100800,5,1215,4.504587155963303
