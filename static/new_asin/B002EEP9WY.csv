8367681,5,B002EEP9WY,"Transproofed is a well made, smart and clever film by filmmakers Calpernia Addams and Andrea James. And very much worth the watch",1249689600,4,129,4.909090909090909
8367682,4,B002EEP9WY,"I was really excited to receive Transproofed and watched it right away once I received it. I am not a transwoman instead born into this life assignment--but it was deeply entertaining and informative all the same. This is a short, sweet, portrait of a woman who is hiding her past identity, but not well enough according to a close friend. Her friend, as friends do, decides to help make sure her trans status is completely undetectable. But the question arises, as her friend removes all that is her from sight: do I want to be this all new person or risk being myself and see? She has a date with a man who doesn't know her status, so they want to ensure his acceptance. This created a funny situation without turning camp, which I appreciated (liking serious subject matter in movies). It turns serious in the right moments without getting heavy. Great film. It will make you want to see more. Highly Recommended.",1249689600,,916,4.625766871165644
8367683,5,B002EEP9WY,"It's always refreshing to find something independent that is well put-together, as well as being entertaining and thought-provoking. Calpernia Addams brings a sincere-feeling depth to her character - the scene with Joel at the end is one of those moments of apparent simplicity while in fact many complex issues are rearing their beautiful heads at the crucial moment.

A huge bonus of this DVD release is the extra material. Andrea James has produced a fabulously detailed and informative featurette with oodles of helpful advice and knowledge for any aspiring independent movie makers out there. I've dabbled in the fine arts of shooting and editing, so much of what she described was familiar, however there were a great many insights I'd never considered before, and just hearing someone else's thoughts and ideas was truly inspiring.

Thank you girls for getting this out there!",1249689600,6,883,5.211267605633803

8367685,4,B002EEP9WY,"If you are a transgendered person, you will get a smile or two out of this little cute movie.  Certainly, it could be longer and bring more into the experience, but in it's briefness, it is still a nice little movie that does a few things.  First, a smile or two for you.  Secondly, if you think about the skit, you begin to realize that you do leave traces all along and being stealth isn't that easy.  And, lastly, perhaps deception (by means of going stealth) is not the best way to go.  As she explains in the skit, she is who she is and he needs to know that regardless of what was printed on a birth certificate many years ago, she IS who she is, someone worhty of his attention.",1249171200,4,685,4.159090909090909
