6402944,2,B00K5KO9S4,"This DVD is only for dancers.  Get it if you can dance.  If you have no dance training or experience, Really really complicated steps.  Fun music though.",1425513600,3,153,4.592592592592593

6402948,5,B00K5KO9S4,"I have used many different exercise videos to work out to and this is one of my favorites of all time.  The music is fun, choreography is straight forward with a section to learn the main moves before you start.  I find it enjoyable and using the dance moves in the video have helped me maintain a healthy weight at a time of year that food is the focus of everyone's time and attention (the holidays!).",1418515200,4,403,4.2894736842105265
6402949,5,B00K5KO9S4,I am a Jennifer Galardi fan and have several of her Dance Off the Inches DVD's. This one was better than I expected. It has some fun hip hop moves and is a good workout. I felt like I was doing the latest dance moves and Jennifer does a good job with choreography.,1412380800,7,264,4.0
6402950,5,B00K5KO9S4,"Boy, what a fun workout. Didn't even feel like I was exercising I had so much fun. Jen Galardi is one of my favorite exercise video instructors. In this one she takes you threw the steps easily. The moves are fun and energizing.  Before you know it you will be sweating off the calories and will enjoy doing it.  Do yourself a favor buy this one.",1412380800,10,346,4.2272727272727275
6402951,5,B00K5KO9S4,"Awesome workout , I don't recommend if you have no coordination the choreography is complex",1409788800,10,91,5.133333333333334
6402952,5,B00K5KO9S4,"I love dancing, I love hip hop.  For a 65 year old that may sound strange, but Jennifer is one of my favorite dancers of hip hop.  I have several of her routine DVDs.  Some ""hip hoppers"" should do something else.  I have wasted money on this stuff, but Dance of the Inches hip hop will always be my favorite.  It has a step guide so you don't just start and get your feet tangle and yourself frustrated.  Very good product.  Well choreographed, well qued.  Just EXCELLENT no matter how you do it!",1360108800,,496,4.258064516129032
8656015,4,B00K5KO9S4,"Not sure you'll break out these moves at a party -- they're a little goofy. But the workout is good for general cardio and the instructor has a fun, upbeat attitude. Though I do wish the warm-up included proper stretches.",1500595200,,221,4.55

8656017,3,B00K5KO9S4,"It's ok, the music is not particularly good like the other one I purchase.  The moves are very easy, just did not feel like I was dancing like the other dvd I have of hers.",1477353600,,172,3.914285714285714

8656019,5,B00K5KO9S4,"I really enjoy Jennifer Galardi's work, along with many others.
She's a great teacher, but you do have to keep at it, because
she'll move on and not wait for you to figure this out. Repeating
is the best way to learn.",1471392000,,217,4.190476190476191

8656023,3,B00K5KO9S4,"I have been a fan of Dance of the Inches since they first started with the Sizzling Salsa. They are easy to follow and fun to practice.
This Hip Hop Jam has great music and she is full of energy. The problem is that the steps are hard for a begginer and there is too much jumping. A person with back problems can easily get hurt.",1431993600,3,329,4.0
8656024,5,B00K5KO9S4,"I was so excited to realize that Jennifer Galardi had an entire series of dance workouts designed to melt away the inches, because that is exactly what I need, and I love her Ballet Body workout so much.  So I bought this because I love dancing to hip hop.  Wow, so fun!  The moves have significantly more funk and a street feel to them.  Moreso than other workouts on the market (even ones calling themselves ""hip hop"" oriented).  I was really impressed.  I must admit that the choreography is very complicated, and not easy to get.  But honestly, I find that to be a plus.  Because I'm concentrating on getting the steps right, the time flies by even faster!  Highly recommend.",1430524800,3,679,4.545454545454546
