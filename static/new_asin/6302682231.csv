494071,5,6302682231,"Director Joseph H. Lewis and veteran prodcuer Harry Joe Brownteam up with Randy Scott, a young Angela Lansbury, and some excellentcharacter actors (Wallace Ford, Warner Anderson) to offer a very fine little Western that repays re-viewing. Scott, the outwardly stern but aging Marshall Calem Ware of the Colorado frontier town Medicine Bow, keeps order in his town, ""hoping to outlive his times,"" as he says. Unkown to him two of the town's biggest businessmen are out to get him, open the town, and undo the ""march of civilization."" The film boasts one of the most remarkable saloon brawls caught on camera and a shoot-out where Scott is ""killed"" (well, he REALLY isn't dead, but the bad guys don't know that). Add the famous touring chanteuse ""Tally Dickenson"" [Angela Lansbury]who just happens to be Calem's wife [!], a cattle baron (whose wife is courted by one of the bad guys], and a huge hulk of man (Dooley Bryan)who helps the wounded Scott, despite Scott having shot his brother, and well, you have all the ingredients for great action and exciting adventure, and there's a slam-bang suprise ending, to boot.  Dialogue is crisp, at times you even hear some things that could be said in Scott's masterwork farewell to movies, Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.  So, unreservedly recommended--a real treat.

Thorne and his business partner would like nothing more than to see to Ware's demise so they can run the town as their personal bank (the town exists due to a nearby mine which they want to reopen as soon as they can get rid of Ware).

494098,4,6302682231,"Director Joseph Lewis enjoys a cult reputation and quite righly so for he made several quality B movies ,and if his best work lay in the film noir genre with movies like The Big Combo and Gun Crazy ,this is not to disparage his Westerns which include such fine taut pictures as 7th Cavalry and Terror in a Texas Town .
Lawless Street is another fine Western in which Randolph Scott plays the Marshall of Medicine Bend ,a man firecely dedicated to his job both from an abstract notion of justice and a form belief in the law .His wife (Angela Lansbury )leaves him when he refuses to abandon his principles despite being gunned down and seriously wounded .In his world view ,the influx of a gang of vcious killers is no excuse to simply walk away from his job .

The movie depicts how he sets out to deal with the problem and rally support. Directiom is lean ,economical and taut .The performances are universally excellent especially from Lansbury and Michael Pate as a likebale killer .The movie benefits indeed from such quality supporting players as Warner Anderson ,Jean Parker Wallace Ford and James Bell

This is eminently enjoyable and recommended unreservedly to Western lovers",1193529600,5,1184,4.742718446601942

494100,4,6302682231,"A LAWLESS STREET has at least one quirky angle that makes it stand out among other Randolph Scott vehicles: Scott apparently is ""killed"" about half way through the action---only to come back towards the end to insure that justice is done. A LAWLESS STREET is always entertaining, filled with the requisite action, plot twists, and surprizes...Scott is superb as the town marshal, and Angela Lansbury as the visiting ""chanteuse"" adds definite interest (especially to those who remember her mostly from MURDER, SHE WROTE!). This is a fine Scott Western and deserves greater currency.",1123977600,4,581,5.258064516129032
494101,3,6302682231,"A Lawless Street is not on par with the great Westerns he made with Budd Boetticher, but it is decent in its own way.

Scott plays a marshal of a town that is barely holding on to lawfulness. His ex-wife, a traveling performer, comes to town at the same time that the two town bosses hire a killer to take care of Scott with the hope that the town will once again be wide open, and they will benefit by making lots of money.

The killer makes a play on Scott, and the town doctor allows the bad guys to think that they succeeded. The story goes from there. Scott is solid and reliable as always, and Angela Lansbury is beautiful as Scott's past and current love. This is not one of Scott's best, but it is an entertaining, fun western.",1121904000,10,735,4.205673758865248

7829308,4,6302682231,"Randolph Scott plays his usually good role as a marshal who wants to stop bad men doing bad by being fast at the draw of the gun he curiously wears over his right back butt. In this film, he is the only person who is keeping a town from destroying itself by letting men interested only in themselves, seducing another mans wife, misleading people, and forcing people to sell what they own for virtually nothing. None of the people in town stand up to the bad people except Scott.
He did this also in another town where he married a pretty woman, but she did not like her husband to be a marshal, and she left him. Now she reappears in this town. Like him who has not stopped loving her, she still loves him. But then she sees that he must stand up against the evil people again, and she decides again to leave him.
But then something happens.",1479254400,,842,4.26875
7829309,5,6302682231,"A Lawless Street is one of the better western movies made.  Not only was it written well, it was filmed and edited the way all western movies should be.  With Randopph Scott as the town Marshal, and Angela Lonsbury as his wife, you know its going to be an entertaining movie.

As the Marshal of Medicine Bend, Calem Ware (Randolph Scott), attempts to keep peace in the lawless town and stay alive at the same time.  The Marshals wife doesnt come into picture until a traveling show arrives.  The star of the show is Tally Dickinson (Angela Lansbury), Calems wife who left him earlier because she didn't like what he was doing.  The story takes a few interesting turns and twists when Marshal Ware nearly dies in a gunfight with a hired killer who knew him in the past.  As soon as the town thinks the Marshal is dead, the two town leaders who are bad guys, and were the ones who hired the gunfighter turns their town into a free for all, hence the name A Lawless Street.  The last scene in the movie says it all when the Marshal give the doctor his guns in a box, and the doctor gives the Marshal his wife back.

I enjoyed every minute of the movie, and you will too.  I give it 5 stars or an A+.  Thats the first A+ I have given any of the movies I have reviewed.  Enjoy!",1449360000,3,1272,4.210743801652892
