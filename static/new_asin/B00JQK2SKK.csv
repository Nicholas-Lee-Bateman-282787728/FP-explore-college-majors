...Although there may be some age-old doubts as to the BBC production of years ago, in my opinion this is finest version to date....The words are spoken directly from the very book by Alexandre Dumas: Alan Badel is fluent in French, and therefore he naturally articulates in French pronunciation when the spoken word demands. He commands a performance that is both convincing and enigmatic in power of destiny of revenge  it is chilling and remarkable! The BBC had televised this outstanding production in black & white before colour transmission followed and now we can reminisce or discover and judge for ourselves whether this is the best version which is available in DVD?

It was a long time ago that the BBC adaption was shown in a series on British television....in 1964 only....and it is wonderful now to have a copy in DVD format! There have, of course, been several feature films  usually disappointing though, with romanticized melodrama and over simplification of the wonderful plots....though I did like the French version with Gerald Depardieu which runs for 360 minutes. Gerald Depardieu is colourful and flamboyant in character of the Count, and it is a lavish production...but this version could be a little annoying or confusing if you are expecting to follow the familiar plot details? In this version, for example, The Count has a French mistress in Paris, and the story romanticizes with a different ending to the original.

Although the BBC drama is 300 minutes in total running time on television, it is quite acceptable that there are many plot details missing in the adventure of this story....for example, there is an absence of Gaspard Canderousse who is to be reintroduced again, later in the story (along with Benedetto/Andrea Cavalcanti in Paris.) .... but having said that though - full credit must be given to the BBC script writer who has kept to the quality of the original story in regard to the connections that enhance mystery in a charm to intrigue....and it is the very finest in British drama with acting performances to match the quality.

The BBC drama is not dated in my opinion, and the complete series has held me spellbound in mystique ever since I had watched it.....so happy to watch again, but a little sad as well, as to the revengeful manner of which the Count lived his life...

I highly recommend to watch the competed series in DVD, and to read the book ....I personally love the book, but would recommend an edition with slightly larger print from the standard issue?",1485561600,2,2745,4.837953091684435

8653325,4,B00JQK2SKK,"Any movie based on a book especially a well read classic, will disappoint. This mini series is pretty close to the mark but has the usual additions, deletions and merging of characters. Compared however to the other efforts including Older and more modern movies, this scores heavily in the fact that the ending is correct. In all other versions Dantes gets back together with Mercedes, for no adequately justifiable reason. This series ends as in the book with Hydee the love interest. The drugs, poisoning, executions and the removal of Dantes from the envolvement in his own schemes is a disappointing consequence of Bowdlerisation.",1474761600,,635,5.115384615384615
