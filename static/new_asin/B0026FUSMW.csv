8352562,3,B0026FUSMW,"I had hoped for an emotional, but rather more pertinent telling of the Nazi atrocity that took place on Cefalonia - the box cover is quick to claim ""The True Story of Captain Corelli`s Mandolin"".
What is presented here is a somewhat overlong Italian TV movie, certainly based on the events that took place, but with a poorly paced and intrusive love story at its centre and with only a cursory attempt made to present individual soldiers as identifiable, sympathetic characters. It's really all about Sergeant Saverio who somehow contrives to be in the middle of every important stage of the proceedings; the script works hard to milk every emotional drop from each strand of the story, ably assisted by Morricone`s rather cloying score. I have a great deal of respect for the composer, but I think that the producers seem to have taken the view that since they were lucky enough to get him they were certainly going to use him to the full - many scenes are consequently played out against a saccharine mix of strings or heavenly choirs.
Its not a bad film; the actors do their best with the material they`ve been given; the locations are beautiful and the cinematography is excellent, its just not quite what it could or should have been.
I don`t think its any better than the seriously flawed Hollywood effort.
This dark chapter in wartime history needs to be told on film, but this isn`t the one to do it.",1363651200,,1408,4.658634538152611
8352563,5,B0026FUSMW,"This is a low budget made for TV movie that portrays the impact of the Italian armistice with the allies in 1944 on the Acqui Division garrisoned on the island of Cefalonia. The German troops on the island do not trust the Italians who are looking forward to returning home to Italy and give them an ultimatum: fight on the German side, surrender their weapons and become prisoners of war or fight against them. After a democratic referendum of all ranks they choose to fight and the film deals with the aftermath. We follow events primarily through the eyes of Sergeant Saverio,who is not only central to the war story but has a strong romantic subplot with the central female character,Feria,an Italian, who had settled on the island but whose husband, Mikis, had disappeared ten years ago. The first half of the film is driven by an underlying tension about what might happen in this unusual war situation and the second half by the conflict felt by Saverio between what he feels for Feria and his identification with his comrades in the the awful events that occur. The subplot with Feria's daughter, Elena, and her father, Mikis, was well integrated with the central story line and did not disturb the flow of this well acted movie. Although a war film,its central theme is the importance of relationship and individuality in spite of the extreme events and this drives many of the anti war statements that emerge through both the dialogue and the action. It is also the source of the deep human emotions that the film taps into. I have probably never been moved so much by a war film! With this focus and its relatively slower pace it is not primarily an action movie, although its depiction of violence is realistic. For this reason I think it will particularly appeal to women. Despite its length(2 hours 16 minutes) and the subtitles my attention was held throughout. I much preferred it to Captain Corelli's Mandolin and it is much harder hitting. As a film, it isn't perfectly crafted by any means, but its emotional journey is so powerful, I had to award it five stars. In some ways it was an old fashioned film::- no gratuitous sex and violence, so if this is what you are looking for, avoid! However,I warmly recommend it to you.",1358294400,4,2243,4.681012658227848
8352564,5,B0026FUSMW,"I have watched both films - Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) and Cefalonia (2005). Both retell the horrific events that took place on the beautiful greek island of Cephalonia in WW2. But I found Cefalonia more disturbing and closer to the truth, based on the few details my father told me before he passed away nearly 10 years ago. He was one of the Italian PoWs that survived the massacre of nearly 10000 Italian soldiers and officers. He had to trek with the Gernmans as they retreated through Greece, the former Yugoslavia and Austria where he witnessed more horrors. It was in Austria, that he and a friend escaped and scoured over the Austro-Italian Alps back to his village north of Lake Como. Highly recommend the movie.",1336867200,4,728,4.785714285714286
8352565,4,B0026FUSMW,"This is an Italian film from 2005 that is just getting a release over here. It purports to tell the story and events that began on the fateful day of 8th September 1943. That was when Italy changed sides after deposing Mussolini and ordered her troops to return home. Those 11,000 serving on the Greek island of Cefalonia thought their war was over. This part of history was also captured in the beautiful `Captain Corelli's Mandolin' (and I mean the book, not the less than adequate film).

The Germans had other ideas realising that they would have to fight their former allies; so deciding to do it sooner rather than later, and while still negotiating they made their move. Whilst the Germans were originally seriously outnumbered, they soon made up for that in both men and material, the Italians had only small arms and some out dated field artillery. They were also painfully aware that there would be no chance of evacuation in the foreseeable future. What followed has gone down as both a war crime and massacre.

What director Ricardo Milani has tried to do, is put flesh on the bones of the story and bring the people to life. He does this by telling snippets of their lives and the romance that blossomed between the two main leads.  The two leads are Luca Zingaretti (playing Savario Blasco an Italian sergeant) and Luisa Ranieri playing a very beautiful  Feria. She has a daughter with her Greek husband who she has not seen for ten years. Her daughter is also falling for one of Savario's comrades. The scenery and the cinematography are beautiful, even though Ennio Morricone did the music, I did not notice if it was that great. That may well have been because I was engrossed in the film. There are moments where it is painful and I did find myself getting a bit dewy eyed and I can't blame it on an over sentimental plot either.

This is one that true history fans will find fault, the Stukas are CGI, but looked quite good, the facts are mostly correct, but some liberties have been taken and there are some small plot holes, check out the English Officer. But I thought that did not matter. This is a wonderfully made and acted film, it is a tad sentimental  at times, but we all need that on the odd occasion. It is also a bit long at 135 minutes, but I felt it was well worth the effort and wish we has have been given a chance to see it sooner.",1319587200,4,2368,4.469907407407407
