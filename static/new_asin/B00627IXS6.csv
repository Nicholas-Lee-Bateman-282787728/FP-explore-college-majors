4932129,5,B00627IXS6,"I was diagnosed with osteoporosis a few months ago and I made the decision not to take the drugs which are routinely prescribed to treat the condition.  In the course of researching other ways to protect my bones, I discovered the Pilates for Buff Bones program and began taking classes with Rebekah.  Rebekah makes it clear from the outset that she is not a doctor but she is nevertheless very knowledgable about both exercise and nutrition and their impact on bone health.  She is also a very patient and talented instructor who cares enormously about what she does and all of that comes through both in her classes and in this video.  The exercise portion of the video is very similar to a typical class so if you don't live near a certified ""Pilates for Buff Bones"" instructor, the video would be the next best thing and if you do take ""in person"" classes, the video is a great way to practice in between.  Recommend very highly.",1324857600,37,933,4.562874251497006
4932130,5,B00627IXS6,"This is a delightful video full of interesting information about the importance of bone health that we should all be aware of - whatever exercise we choose to do. And although it can be a demanding workout, its focus on cleverly designed exercises by an experienced educationalist means you do not need to have abdominals of steel to get through it!

Like other DVDs, there are levels to choose from so if you want to sweat you can, but thank you on behalf of people like me who sometimes want to enjoy effective movement rather than pushing through a repetitive and sometimes painful workout.

Rebekah's approach is clear and precise and she balances instruction with flow really well. Well done Pilates for Buff Bones - at last a Pilates video that men and women can enjoy doing knowing that every care has been taken to protect their spine throughout.",1324252800,14,854,4.724832214765101
4932131,5,B00627IXS6,"What differentiates Rebekah's Buff Bones workouts from so many of the others is that Rebekah has an appreciation for medicine and science.  She has incorporated years of research of medical evidence as well as consultations with top physicians into everything she creates.  As a physician, this is important to me and gives me confidence when I recommend it to patients.  This video is not only motivating and fun for people of many different ages groups and levels of health, but it is designed in a smart and scientific way to make you healthier.",1324166400,31,548,4.870967741935484
4932132,5,B00627IXS6,"This video is superbly organized, beautiful to watch and stands out among others that are similar in that all movement has been designed for both safety and therapeutic intent for people with osteoporosis.  Especially important is the section where Rebekah explains the principles behind her routines. The movements target key areas of importance for strengthening for the bones and the DVD has been designed so that you can do part, or all, of the routines according to the time and energy you have available.  Rebekah's own story is illuminating for anyone who thinks that the condition of osteoporosis is reserved for older people.  Kudos to Rebekah for a job well done!  This is the type of well-thought-out work that is much needed in the exercise field.

4932141,5,B00627IXS6,"I was surprised that it is an hour workout, but it goes fast and you feel great when you are done. It also gives you an option of doing it with help of a pillow or doing push ups the easy way, or you can see how to do things with a challenge. the choice is yours.",1435968000,,263,3.6315789473684212
4932142,5,B00627IXS6,"I went thru menopause at age 41 and have had cancer & chemo and taken femara for 5 years.  At age 63, I have reason to worry about my bones.  I read ""Your Bones"" and began taking supplements for bone building.  The book recommended Pilates.  I read reviews and decided on this video for my bones.  I do a lot of hiking, biking, swimming, lifting weights, etc.  I am no weakling.  I was looking for a video that would educate me on proper form to protect bones.  This video does that.  It is about balance, mobility and proper form.  She reminds you not to let your head dangle or if your back should be flat or curved.  She reminds you if you should be breathing in or out.  Although some of the reviewers do not believe this is a good workout, I believe it is.  I do jumping jacks to warm up at the beginning and and plank while she explains something during the workout.  Otherwise, I follow the dvd.  I intend to continue doing this dvd at least twice a week.",1434672000,,962,4.208791208791209
4932143,5,B00627IXS6,"Like this DVD very much.  It has a very good Pilates mat workout but is modified for people that have to be careful of some Pilates movements due to having low bone density.  The mat segment is about 42 minutes long and is more detailed and has more movements than another Pilates for Bones DVD I have (I alternate them).

Also like the standing segment with the weights although would have liked that part to be longer, it's only about 17 minutes.

I think this is a great workout and Rebekah knows what she is doing with Pilates and helping people with bone issues.  Very glad that I bought it.",1434412800,,596,4.381818181818182
4932144,5,B00627IXS6,I took the training for this course without ever taking the actual class.  It was very helpful to see the sequence from start to finish by the founder.,1431216000,,151,4.392857142857143
4932145,2,B00627IXS6,"This is a very basic Pilates program for someone who has not done Pilates before. If you are a professional looking for any new info you won't find it but for the average non- health professional its a good dvd with some good info on osteoporosis. If you have already have done Pilates for some time, you will not find this challenging enough. If you really want a light workout this is for you.",1427068800,2,395,4.351351351351352

4932148,5,B00627IXS6,Good one!,1415232000,,9,4.0
4932149,5,B00627IXS6,Very nice presentation and overall flow of the different segments of the workout. It wasn't overly hard but felt as if it might really work to strengthen bones and the body. I was looking for a workout that could be done when I wasn't looking for a high intensity aerobic effort and this is perfect. Will look for other DVD's by this same instructor.,1412985600,,350,4.484375
4932150,5,B00627IXS6,Detailed explanations of each exercise and shows different levels. Enjoyable and realistic.,1406592000,,91,6.666666666666667

4932153,5,B00627IXS6,"This is a wonderful video on buff bones. It does require the buyer to play it over and over to get an idea on exercise. Rebekah Rotstein is a wonderful person to share her own experience on oesteoporosis with us. She is correct on saying that this is not confined to menopausal women. There seems to be an epidemic of oesteoporosis at present, not only women but young men too. My 25yr old daughter was diagnosed with it last year, what a shock. Many thanks again.",1402185600,,464,4.406976744186046
4932154,5,B00627IXS6,"Ms. Rotstein knows the body, bones, and delivers superb, detailed instructions in a nicely-paced workout.  It's not an aerobic workout - take a walk or hop on the bike if you just want to destress and sweat buckets. But if you are sincerely interested in working your joints and bones, building your core, improving your posture, avoiding injury and looking fabulous, grab this workout.

Yes, it's an hour, but you can break it into sections. There are also workout tips, detailed information about our bones,and a bit about her own journey with weak bones.

For the informed, intelligent woman who desires to strengthen her body and prevent further injury.

She's the one the certified Pilates instructors go to to learn how to work with people with osteoporosis/osteopenia, by the way, and this is one of the best tools I have found!",1396569600,7,835,4.900709219858156
4932155,5,B00627IXS6,"Very good DVD if you love Pilates but have osteopenia or osteoporosis.

4932157,5,B00627IXS6,Rebekah takes mat exercises and has made them safe but challenging for anyone even if you do not have osteoporosis. It is a great workout.,1391385600,,138,4.56
4932158,4,B00627IXS6,This DVD is just the right intensity for me. The techniques are not too easy or difficult to do when exercising. The information provide is also very instructive>,1385251200,,162,4.821428571428571
4932159,4,B00627IXS6,"This CD is easy to follow and gives three different wasy to do the poses.
 You are given three people to watch at the beginnger's level and beyond, whichever is suited to you.
Sound and picture are very good.
Yes, to my way of thinking, it was worth the money I padi for it.
Because I take regular Yoga classes, I cannot compare this with either Yoga or Pilates CDs.",1362528000,3,366,4.228571428571429
4932160,5,B00627IXS6,"I just got this one last month (having had an eye on it for ages) - and I love it! I think it's one of the smartest Pilates DVDs I've done.

For those that like faster, harder, faster, stronger, faster, bigger type pace and movements for your Pilates, then this is so not for you. The pace is deliberate, with Rebekah getting you correctly positioned before you start each exercise. There are two backgrounders, and between the three of them you're given three levels to work to; I think the ""easier"" level could've shown a few more modifications for beginners, but it's still not too bad. Better than a lot of the beginner modifications I've seen in Pilates DVDs!

I've read a few comments about this DVD only being for beginners with just a little room to grow - if that's the case then I have to question why on earth I'm training as a Pilates instructor, since I get a seriously good workout from it. The pacing and positioning means that I can maintain good form, which means I actually get something out of it (I find that a lot of Pilates DVDs I'm rushing too much from one exercise to the next, and don't actually get much out of the exercises).

Rebekah is delightful - funny and warm. I don't have osteoporosis or osteopenia (although have a history of not great bone density readings due to prednisone use - my last reading was well and truly back in the normal range though), but do have neck issues, and so the absence of flexion exercises makes this a great one for me when my neck is playing up.

4932161,5,B00627IXS6,I have been doing Pilates Mat for over 10 years and using the Pilates Reformer combined with PT for the last 3 years to correct my posture and to build my bones. I just started to use Pilates for Buff Bones and it is outstanding. I want the next series from Rebekah it is that good. Rebekah is a wonderful example of someone who was diagnosed in her 20's with osteoporosis and took charge of her future. We can all do this and Pilates for Buff Bones is a great start in my journey to stand tall and to be strong. Please create your next DVD and iPhone App for those of us that want more!!  Thanks Rebekah!!,1359158400,5,606,4.135593220338983
4932162,5,B00627IXS6,"I'm a 30-something woman and was very pleased this DVD was just as appropriate for me as it would be for someone older. The exercises are demonstrated by three different women of varying levels; Rebekah herself shows the intermediate version (and with a fit body that many of us would envy!).  She is encouraging and motivating, but most importantly, I am seeing results; my back feels so much better after the workout, my posture improved, and my hips toned. This DVD is a keeper.",1358294400,4,481,4.726190476190476
4932163,1,B00627IXS6,"Lets start by saying finding a good Pilates DVD is challenging to say the least. I have bought this one based only on reviews for it and let me say I have never been steered so wrong by Amazon reviews. This DVD was awful. In fact there were parts of it where i just laughed at it because it was so silly. I have taken Pilates mat classes and they are always difficult, as they should be since I'm using muscle groups that I'm not typically using. Now I'm not saying I'm looking for a PX90 style work out but I want a honest Pilates class on a DVD that last 60 to 90 minutes that's going to challenge be beyond the basics. I also want an instructor that is motivating, and you know one that is actually fit like say, a fitness instructor?  This DVD is suitable for children and not much else. Maybe she should have called this Pilates for Buff Kids.",1354492800,2,848,4.170731707317073
4932164,3,B00627IXS6,"Would have been better  for her to  do the exercises and someone  with more pleasing voice to narrate.  Seems a minor thing, but when you use a DVD repeatedly things grate on your nerves.",1354406400,4,187,4.411764705882353
4932165,1,B00627IXS6,"This DVD was defective. I had problems advancing the picture. And, the picture kept breaking up.

Other DVDs worked fine",1352851200,2,120,5.0
4932166,5,B00627IXS6,"When I was diagnosed with osteoporosis, I was very concerned about performing yoga poses and other stretches that might fracture my back.  This video provides an hour long program of supported stretches and workout with light hand/leg weights.  I am not sure if it actually builds bones, but I do feel better after doing it.  Wish she would make more videos.",1352505600,7,358,4.836065573770492
4932167,5,B00627IXS6,"I buy lots of exercise videos and have tried to find a pilates type one that would help but that would also be easy to do.
Well this one has easy moves but it's really quite intense and I can feel my body being stretched and challenged.
I like it has segments, most are floor work but there is a standing segment too with a short time using weights.
I have hip problems and can really feel them being used in a gentle but strong manner.
I am very impressed with this DVD and use it regularly and always feel the benefits of it.",1351296000,14,527,4.076923076923077
4932168,5,B00627IXS6,"I purchased this DVD because I am interested in keeping my bones strong and the exercise is a plus.

This has something for everyone, and you feel GREAT after it's done.",1348444800,7,316,4.431034482758621
4932169,5,B00627IXS6,"This is the third video I've purchased in the last few months and I wish I would have bought this one first!  I'm 54 years old, not an avid exerciser and not very flexible, and although the exercises in this video look mild/simple, they pack a punch.  By the time the video ends I'm sweating and glad the workout is over until next time!!!  Rebekah Rothstein is very pleasant and likeable, and she explains the movements extremely well.  I highly recommend this video, thank you Rebekah!",1346976000,16,487,4.627906976744186
4932170,3,B00627IXS6,"This workout is so very short, I was disappointed. The workout is good but I still want more. I get warmed up, and do the workout and then it is over. Again, it's a good workout but just not long enough.",1332979200,5,203,3.975609756097561
4932171,5,B00627IXS6,"This is a great video for anyone who has osteoporosis. Since I was diagnosed with osteoporosis I have had to give up many of my exercise videos because of the movements with flexion and twists included in them. Rebekah has been careful to leave out any movements that might be detrimental to the bones. She has a lot of hip strengthening and balance movements. You don't work up a sweat with this video but at the end you definitely know that you have had a workout. It's probably not for you if you want cardio and strength in one workout. This is a Pilates based routine.

In the video you watch 3 people---Rebekah, a woman doing modifications for beginners, and a woman doing modifications for stronger people. There is no music but Rebekah has a pleasant voice. She is precise about what you should be doing and throughout the video continues to remind you to use proper form. This has become my favorite excercise video along with Sheri Betz' Pilates for Osteoporosis and Joanna Hall's Drop a Size for Life. The latter has some things that I cannot do because of forward bending and twisting but it also includes cardio.",1331683200,17,1125,4.625

Rebekah is an expert in her field and shares her knowledge, making it so you can follow it even if you are a novice.  The Pilates world is blessed to have Rebekah's passion and expertise. Her exercises are designed for persons with Osteoporosis, however they are such that they can be taught to others, and they will benefit from the roundness of Rebekah's work.

8491026,5,B00627IXS6,"This video consists of low impact, slow and easy exercise.  At first I thought ""this can't possibly benefit me; it's too easy.""  But I found that afterward, I felt relaxed, not as stiff, and pain-free.  Some of the back exercises were difficult for me, but I did the best I could, being careful not to experience any pain. I also take isolated movements and do them every day when I think about it.  It's easy to incorporate them into my day's routine.  So, although I expected something more challenging, on a temporary basis at least, this does make me feel better",1527206400,,566,4.564356435643564

I find some exercise DVDs either have annoying voices after a while, are too slow, or talk to you with pep talk like you are half senile or a second grader. Thankfully this one is very good.
