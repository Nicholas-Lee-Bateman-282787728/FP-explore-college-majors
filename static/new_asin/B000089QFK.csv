The animation isn't like that of today, but one needs to keep in mind the era that this anime was made. If something a little off beat and nostalgic is what you want, this series is for you.",1374192000,,330,4.092307692307692
7980768,5,B000089QFK,"This is a lot better than I thought it would be. The writing doesn't closely follow the original Japanese script, but was changed for a U.S. market resulting in a completely unique series. The series doesn't take it self seriously so the result is a long line of non-stop laughing goodness.",1294531200,,290,4.705882352941177

The characters here can become overly dramatic about each other without getting on my nerves and they all just blends in so perfectly despite their huge differences. What I thought was wierd was the fact that the boys loved chocolate so much and eventually I realized that one of them was allergic to it, which left him in a drunken state that would save the day. Another enigma was why the happy puppet girl with green hair always said strange things like ""You're welcome"" when no one thanked her. I guess they're just phrazes she uses to express excitement. My favorite character over all is Professor Big Bang, who seemes to be a huge and confused man-woman with a past in the military. He crushes on another GORGEOUS male teacher, who happens to be a mellow vampire whom is always careful not to crumble in the sunlight. There's no real nudity, nor too much violence...but what anime doesn't have violence..?You just have to see it for yourself. I couldn't possibly explain how good it is. And I'm one to hate dramatic anime.",1130544000,2,1103,4.63265306122449
