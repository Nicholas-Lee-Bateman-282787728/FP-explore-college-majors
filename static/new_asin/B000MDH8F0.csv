8645773,5,B000MDH8F0,"Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage is a recently released anime that continues to follow the exploits of the mercenary band ""Lagoon Company"". While the first season was burdened with introducing the numerous characters and their relationships, the second season is all action and no filler.

In the second season there are twelve episodes, but only three story arcs which take place over multiple episodes. The antagonists in the first story ""Hansel and Gretel"", continue to demonstrate the originality of japanese writers, and the story climaxes in an unexpected ending.

In the second story ""Greenback Jane"", the Lagoon Company along with Eda from the Church of Violence face off against a horde of unique bounty hunters that ends in the destruction of the Lagoon Company's headquarters.

In the third story ""Fujiyama Gangsta Paradise"", Rock and Revy assist Hotel Moscow in creating a place for the russian mafia in Tokyo, Japan. Rock must deal with his reservations about the business he is in, and confronts Balalaika in an unwise move, much to Revy's dismay. This story ends in a great battle between Revy and Ginji.

This is an ongoing series based on a long-running manga so hopefully a third season of this wonderful anime will be forth coming.",1176336000,2,1250,5.053398058252427
