8192879,3,B0000CABC0,these are fairly good movies with some action from the past.  A little less well known than his other blockbusters but entertaining.,1355961600,,132,5.0
8192880,3,B0000CABC0,I ordered this box set and both movies are advertised as being widescreen.  THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE!  I received my copy and the 6th Day was widescreen.  The Last Action hero was in Pan and Scan.  This is crap.  Buyer beware.  The back of the keepsake box even showed both movies as being widescreen.,1107475200,13,309,4.428571428571429
8192881,3,B0000CABC0,"I thought this movie was a lot of fun.  I enjoy action flicks, though I started to become a bit disenchanted with them because they were so predictable and unrealistic.  I think that's what was so good about this movie.  It made fun of action flicks while being an action flick.  Sadly, I've found that most of my friends didn't care for the movie as much as I did.  But I thought it was fun.",1104883200,,392,4.173333333333333
