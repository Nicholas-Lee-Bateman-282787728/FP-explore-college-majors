8218856,5,B000VIPXB2,"Regardless of what other people have written about this collection, it is exactly as advertised. It comes in a cardboard box that holds all 6 movies, and includes an autographed picture of Ted V. Mikels himself. Now I am giving this collection a 5-star rating not so much based on the indiviual movies, but due to the overall collection and reasonable price. You have to like very low-budget B(or Z-grade) movies to enjoy this set, and if you go in with that mindset you will like this collection. The stand out is ""The Doll Squad"", the movie Aaron Spelling got his idea for ""Charlie's  Angels"" from. ""The Corpse Grinders"" is a hoot, with cats attacking their owners after eating cat food made from dead humans! ""Girl in Gold Boots"" is about a waitress wanting to go to L.A. to be the best Go-Go- dancer that she can be. The other movies included are ""Blood Orgy of the She-Devils""(hell of a name!), ""10 Violent Women"", and ""The Corpse Grinders part 2"". Great collection for B-movie fans and a lot of fun!",1470528000,4,1005,4.583333333333333
8218857,2,B000VIPXB2,"Warning! Contrary to what the image may suggest, the DVDs are not autographed and are not packaged as a box set. You'll get 6 DVDs wrapped in cellophane bag. That's it. Granted, that may still be a good price for 6 DVDs, but that's not what I expected.",1465257600,3,252,4.270833333333333
