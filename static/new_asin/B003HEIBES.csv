8397043,5,B003HEIBES,I have purchased all 4 of the volumes and have been very pleased with the videos.  My entire family has enjoyed practicing at home with them. They are beautifully done and wonderful in their content.  I would recommend them to anyone practicing Shotokan or to anyone thinking about starting.  They are all well worth the money.,1350518400,,327,4.803571428571429
8397044,5,B003HEIBES,This instruction in traditional karate is excellent.  If you are a Shotokan student then you should have these DVDs in your library.,1303171200,,132,5.0
