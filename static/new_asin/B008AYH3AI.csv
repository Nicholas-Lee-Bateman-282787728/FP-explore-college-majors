5145987,5,B008AYH3AI,"Great storylines, terrific acting, lots of great suspense and twists, gorgeous actors...what's not to like?  I don't normally buy TV shows on DVD.  My daughters and I got tired of taping reruns on TV that were always out of sync, and decided we wanted to watch it from Episode One all the way thru.  We are currently on Season 4, and really enjoying it.  DVD's are great...just like watching TV.  Would definitely recommend this show and these DVD's.",1366329600,,450,4.717948717948718

5145997,3,B008AYH3AI,"I was disappointed that I bought a set of new dvd's and the 1st. season had lots of shelf wear on the outer edges inside the film wrapper.  I wonder if it was really a used season one dvd and the set put together as a ""new dvd collection.  I will keep it, but I doubt I will order again.  It is to be a gift for my grandson's birthday and I am a bit embarrassed to give a gift that looks like it is used.",1378425600,,404,3.6744186046511627
5145998,5,B008AYH3AI,"I ordered seasons 1-7 of Criminal Minds, my fav show and I can say what I got was exactly what I ordered.
The only thing I have noticed that is a disappointment is the music in one of the episodes playing during a scene is different from the episode shown on tv repeats. Why is anybodys guess.",1378425600,,293,4.157894736842105
5145999,5,B008AYH3AI,"Love the actors! They reel you in and you are hooked! The very best TV thriller/crime drama ever! Yes, it has intense scenes, sometimes sad, sometimes scary, but always well acted and always keeps you coming back for more!!  There's humor at times and wonderful relationships between the agents. Love it.",1378339200,,304,4.96078431372549
5146000,5,B008AYH3AI,"I purchased this for my son for his birthday.  Our family loves this show.  It was perfect was him.  I had no problem with the merchandise.  My only issue was with the shipping.  I was able to get this shipped with my 2-day free shipping through my Prime membership.  Somewhere along the way, my package was diverted to another county and shipped 40-50 miles away from me.  Needless to say, it didn't arrive in time for my son's birthday.  Luckily, he's a grown man and understands this type thing.  If he weren't, this would've caused a serious problem.",1377734400,,554,4.571428571428571
5146001,5,B008AYH3AI,I am a huge Criminal Minds fan so I just had to order this. I received my package 3 days earlier than the estimated delivery date and the price was amazing. I did receive a disc that skipped(i believe was caused during shipping since there was an imprint on it as if it had been dropped) and was sent a replacement season within two days. I couldn't be happier with this purchase!,1376524800,2,380,4.291666666666667
5146002,5,B008AYH3AI,I love criminal minds I am a big fan!!!! I missed the first few seasons- couldn't get on my tv. so glad I get to see them all now!!!!,1374624000,,133,3.6206896551724137
5146003,5,B008AYH3AI,"I love Criminal Minds it is a thinking show. You can not watch it and zone this is one reason I like it so. The story lines the writers come up with make me wonder about their minds (ha ha).Also, the actors are top notch.",1374451200,,221,3.933333333333333
5146004,5,B008AYH3AI,"I couldn't be much happier with this purchase. I've been watching Criminal Minds primarily in syndication for quite a while, so it's a great experience to be watching them in sequence. It's much easier to catch all the ongoing nuances from show to show. We've made this an ongoing evening activity although some of the material is clearly not suitable for a younger audience. We're only in Season 2 and are already planning to buy the seasons to catch up when we're done.",1372809600,7,471,4.686746987951807
5146005,5,B008AYH3AI,I was finally able to get my boyfriend to start watching the show. We completed the recent season while it was airing. He's so into it that he wants to watch all the reruns. So I got the DVD set so he can watch all in order. Best purchase ever!!!!,1370995200,,247,3.96
5146006,3,B008AYH3AI,"Criminal Minds is an average crime show following a team of FBI profilers who help other law enforcement agencies track down serial killers.  Although solid in most of its characters and imaginative in most of its plots, the series nevertheless falls victim to its own modus operandi of cheap humor and superficial characters.

The series has always kept a good cast for the most part: in particular with Thomas Gibson as Aaron Hotchner, Joe Montegna as David Rossi, and Shemar Moore as Special Agent Derek Morgan. Paget Brewster as Special Agent Emily Prentiss and A.J. Cook as Special Agent JJ Jareau also provide strong and credible female characters. Matthew Gray Gubler as Dr. Spencer Reid and Kirsten Vangsness as Penelope Garcia are the weakest links in the series which could have done much better without them.

Gubler's character definitely adds to the intellectual dimension to the series but his overly effeminate physique and introverted intellectual traits make it unlikely that he would ever see something other than a desk in the FBI.  To see him running around chasing serial killers with his gun drawn seems hard to believe.  Furthermore, to my knowledge, the FBI does not authorize revolvers as primary weapons but only as back up weapons: he would thus be in violation of FBI administrative protocols and subject to disciplinary action if not fully terminated from his employment if he were to actually work for the FBI.  This only makes the series laughable as the basic character scenario is just not credible enough for me to start with.

The character of Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) is the worst part of the series.  It is therefore no surprise that best seasons are the earlier ones in which she appears the least as a principal character.  Her emotional tantrums (not to mention her complete lack of good taste) are simply obnoxious.  Listening to her talk to Morgan and others with her stupid 'sweetie pie' remarks makes her come across as an unprofessional emotional wreck who undermines the dramatic qualities of the show.  A grotesque incarnation of Ms. Piggy from 'The Muppet Show', she smothers the rest of the cast at odd intervals with her pathetic appeals.  Unlike the comparable Abbie in NCIS which is more of an action-comedy series with light drama suited for this kind of character, Criminal Minds' mainly dramatic theme involving sadistic sociopaths requires more credible characters with less light humor.  One shouldn't have to expect the sudden appearance of Kermit and the rest of the muppet gang to ease the tension in this kind of show.  Cynical sarcasm such as the one used by the characters in the Law & Order series would have worked better for this show.

Other negative aspects of the show are the famous quotes repeated in the introduction and conclusion.  Most of the time the quotes are so far removed from the theme sought to be illustrated in the episode that they comes out as nothing more than vain sophomoric pseudo-intellectualism: a pretentious utterance just to sound intelligent all while demonstrating obvious ignorance as to its full meaning while making it.

One final flawed characteristic of this show is the inclusion of songs in minor keys at the end of the show to amplify a theme of ironic resolution or fatalistic outcome in the narrative.  The use of this technique is tedious as it tries to subtly reveal only what is already blatantly obvious to the audience:  the proper formula for leitmotif is exactly the opposite which is why their formula is just a stupid attempt at doing the opposite of what actually works in film and audio effects.  The songs themselves usually being of the utmost mediocrity in every respect only dramatize the show's already ever-present blandness instead of focusing on the scene's obvious dramatic suspense or release!

In conclusion, the plot lines and the development of the antagonists in most of the episodes are pretty good although there are a few far-fetched ones.  Some of the episodes involve either unlikely profiles such as two teens wanting to recreate a video-game or the plots are too complex to really make them fit in a one-hour format.  Still, most of the episodes are pretty well written and more credible than the over-the-top scenarios found in some of the CSI or Bones episodes.  Two principal characters really bring an otherwise good show concept to the mediocre along with some very awkward musical arrangements that are contrary to good sense in terms of leitmotif.  In addition, the use of famous quotes to illustrate thematic elements too often illustrate more the script writer's ignorance as to what these quotes really mean than anything else.",1370476800,2,4679,4.9832904884318765

5146010,5,B008AYH3AI,"Even though reruns of Criminal Minds play all the time on cable networks, I kept missing pivotal episodes that explained one or more character's plot line. Buying the whole set not only saved me money but it allowed me to follow my favorite cast through every twist and turn. Every disc was in great condition (although the packaging on two seasons looked a little beat up from shipping) and every episode played beautifully. If you love this show, I highly recommend buying the set. Plus you get plenty of bonus material, gag reels, and commentary from the actors. It's great!",1369094400,4,577,4.78

8526539,5,B008AYH3AI,"Great way to catch up on the seasons you did not see before entering the Criminal Minds Universe if you are like me or to see your favorite shows again which out having to put up with commercials on late night TV if, again, you are like me. Worth every penny! You can even watch the episodes with Frank (a favorite serial killer of mine) one after another if you are willing to juggle disks. But just being able to go back and watch old favorites now is great!  And isn't that the real reason we buy these collections?",1415577600,,518,4.232323232323233
