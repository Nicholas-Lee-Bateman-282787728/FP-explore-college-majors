1392694,5,B0000542CI,"I LIKED THIS MOVIE. THE FIRST, TIME I SAW IS WHEN I WAS A KID. I HAD SAW IT IN THE STORE AND I HAD TO HAVE IT. IT STARS YOUNG TOM CRUISE SHELLY LONG AND OTHER STARS I LIKE THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKE CLASSIC 80'S MOVIES THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS MOVIE AND THEREFORE, I WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO LIKE ROAD TRIP MOVIES TO BUY THIS MOVIE.",1094256000,3,341,3.8857142857142857
1392695,1,B0000542CI,"I bought this (luckily used for very cheap) after reading some of these reviews on Amazon.  I didn't laugh at anything; the characters were too painfully one-dimensional.  Even Cruise in an early part of his career (although post-Outsiders, which was a pretty good performance) was wooden.
The story is pretty standard fare for the ""teen adventure comedy"" and everything ends on an upbeat note.
A strange thing was that I thought it was set in or around 1983, when it was made - yes, Dave drives a '57 Chevy, but a lot of motorhead kids in my high school (in 1983) did similar.  I did notice the Tijuana cop drove a 50's style car (not sure of model) but just assumed that public services in Tijuana couldn't afford anything more modern.  But at the end, when they were queued up at customs, ALL the cars were 50s-types.  I thought perhaps it was going to be some joke about a classic car rally - but since there wasn't, I can only conclude that this movie was taking place in the late '50s.  You wouldn't know it from the story though - only from the cars.
Anyway, even if a TV channel was showing it for free, it's not worth watching.  Lame, lame, lame.  Watch ""The Night Before"" starring Keanu Reeves and you will be much more entertained (and intrigued) in a movie that has a similar kind of ""high school kids in trouble after hours"" feel.",1067126400,7,1343,4.453061224489796
1392696,5,B0000542CI,"This has to be one of the most underrated teen movies in the 1980's, and I've been a fan of this movie since I was 14 and now that I'm 22, I still love this movie.
The story is about 3 high school seniors Dave (the Frank Sinatra/sex obsessed pal) Woody (the sensitive intellegent person) and Spyder (a tough boy from a broken home) who plan a trip to Tijuana in search of sex, but the plan backfires as Dave's little brother Wendel 'Wimp' comes along with them as well as a runaway bride (Shelley Long)
As they arrive in Tijuana, the boys go out and look for a good time and later they meet the crooked cops, insane marine sailors and junkyard ruffians and they decide to get out of Tijuana and make it across the border.
Even though this movie has a little plot, it's fun to watch this movie and it truly deserves more recognition with today's youth. This movie is alot better than today's teen flicks.",1042416000,16,903,4.317647058823529
1392697,2,B0000542CI,"A MESSAGE FROM THE WWS:
(THE WIDESCREEN WATCHERS SOCIETY)
What a shame we the public (in this case Shelley Long and/or Losin' It fans) have been ripped off again by getting stuck with the horrible pan-and-scan mode known as ""standard screen.""
Widescreen has been used by 95% of all movies since 1953, and Losin' It came out in 1983 - yet although it was shot in widescreen we get nothing but standard screen.
Quality-wise, the 5 star rating system regarding DVDs should basically be awarded according to the following levels:
1 star - Standard screen version of widescreen movie, with no trailer or other features.
2 stars - Standard screen version of widescreen movie, with no other features except a trailer.
3 stars - Standard screen version of standard shot movie (most of which were of course done pre-1953.) Trailer and audio commentary could push it to 4 stars.
4 stars - Widescreen version of widescreen movie, with trailer and audio commentary, although maybe not with the cleanest picture or sound.
5 stars - Widescreen version of widescreen movie, with trailer, audio commentary and any other extras, all with perfect artifact-free picture and 5.1 or DTS sound.
Hopefully, Shelley's next movie due out on DVD will at least be in wonderful widescreen. (It is The Money Pit, slated for Feb. 3, 2003.)
And, hey - when are we also going to get a widescreen version of  Shelley's masterpiece, Troop Beverly Hills? I think we've waited more than long enough!
~~~
UPDATE: Later in the summer of 2003, Troop Beverly Hills was indeed released on DVD... only in crummy standard screen. Thanks for yet another ripoff, guys.
And for those of you viewers who say you don't like those black widescreen lines at the top and bottom of your TV set, please bear in mind that in the near future all TVs will be widescreen and the big black bars will be virtually gone.
However, when you will try to play a standard screen DVD on the widescreen TV, big black bars WILL appear - this time at the right and left sides, which is a hundred times worse than top and bottom!
Think about it: a massive investment now in standard screen DVDs will in 2015 result in the same scenario as being stuck with hundreds of Beta tapes in 1985!",1041984000,6,2217,4.670076726342711
1392698,5,B0000542CI,"I loved this DVD mostly because i just love the movie itself, but it was even better to see it on DVD. The sound, picture, and just all around quality was all perfect.

1392708,1,B0000542CI,"I bought this movie because I am a big fan of 80's movies especially the teen comedies like Making The Grade and Class. I had never seen this film so thought it might be cute. I was curious to see one of Tom Cruise's early films and I love John Stockwell. This is the story of a group of male friends who drive down to Mexico to lose their virginity to whores. On the way they pick up a married housewife looking to get a quickie divorce from her husband. Set in the late 50's or early 60's the music is classic but the setting is depressing. This movie has no redeeming qualities. Boring script, unappealing characters, silly premise. Shelley Long does not add anything to it either. It's astounding to me that Tom Cruise ever went on to become a star as he displays no charisma here at all. Losin' It reminded me of another 80's teen flick- Mischief- which is also about the loser virgin in the 50's trying to have sex. I doubt this movie will ever stand out as a classic 80's film.",1427760000,,984,4.267379679144385
1392709,5,B0000542CI,reason i wanted this movie -it is a classic i think. however the boys did not go to Tijuana Mexio. They went to Mexicai Mexico which is right across from Calexico California in the Imperial Valley and hotels  and bars etc where they went were movie stages set up in Calexico. If you look real close at the scenes  you will see a movie marque advertising adult movies in English. also during the chase scene they drove by the old Cooks market in Calexico. The scenes of the drugstores and uphostery shops did appear to be shot in Mexicali. Also the fountain scenes were shot in Calexico so this movie brought back some memories and is why i rated it a 5.,1424304000,,653,4.344262295081967

1392714,3,B0000542CI,"Losin' It is teen sex comedy that follows the adventure of four High School friends from Los Angeles that traveled to Tijuana,Mexico in order to lose their virginity. Over there,they meet a woman named Kathy,who was planning for a quick divorce. The setting of the story was in 1965.

The cast involves future stars Tom Cruise and Shelley Long. The story is predictable. The comedic scenes are barely funny and would definitely elicit any laughter who is watching it. Finally,the pacing was slow and boring and so was the direction. The only positive thing about it is Jackie Earle Haley,who definitely provided something bright in the movie. It would have been a forgettable film if Cruise and Long were not part of the cast nor was Curtis Hanson,an Academy Award winning director was not at helm in it.",1408838400,2,804,4.826086956521739

1392716,2,B0000542CI,"I'm not sure what the point of this movie was, other than to satisfy the wish dreams of the male producers involved in this movie.  The only thing you're going to be ""losin'"" is the money you spent on this movie.  Filled with cliche's and cardboard characters, the film was pretty predictable.  I like movies whose characters have a little more depth than portrayed here.  Heck, if I want a fun in the sun in Mexico movie, I'd recommend Assault of the Killer Bimbos...actually better and cuter than the title might imply.  I gave this two stars, as I thought Shelly Long could use a break.  You don't see her much anymore and I loved her on Cheers.",1397001600,,648,4.4491525423728815
1392717,1,B0000542CI,"Don't buy this movie.  It's absolutely horrible along with the acting.  I heard this movie was bad, but had to see for myself.  It's fun to see how actors get a start and how they end up in other movies together, but that's about the only interesting thing about this movie.  I definitely don't recommend this to anybody, but if you're like me and need to see it for yourself then consider yourself warned.",1396569600,5,406,4.445945945945946
