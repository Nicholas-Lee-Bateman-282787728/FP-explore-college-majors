It starts with hundreds of cattle in the background. The Majestic Theatre shows a New Musical Extravaganza. Dorothy sings. But their backer has backed out. [Its a business deal.] Can they raise $25,000 to put on the show? Dorothy sends a telegram to her ranch. Can she sell the ranch? Roy offers advice to Gabby. [Notice no sidearms.] There is an offer for the ranch. Can the broker buy low and sell high? Nice shooting, Lacey! There is a chase for action. Gabby lassoes his prey. Let them walk back to town. A steam locomotive arrives at Coldbrook. One big happy family? Miss Bryant has friends. She plans to sell a going business to invest in a speculative business! The station wagon stops. The other cowboys sing for the girls. There is a plan to discourage a sale. Will they be frightened by wild animals?

Those two men approach Gabbys place and talk to Dorothy about a sale. Look what theyve done to this place says Gabby. There are humorous conversations. Dorothy wants to go into town. [How long can they keep up this deception?] Roy talks about the history of the first settlers. Can Miss Wanda learn more from Bob? Will Dorothy sell the ranch for a low amount? Yes1 [Know the value of any item by getting independent estimates from others.] There is a song to welcome the girls. But they left! Why? Roy learns there are riders on the south range, they race to investigate. [Long shots suggest the use of doubles.] Bowman bought the ranch and is rounding up the cattle for sale. Rustlers, lets go get them! They don't have air like this in Chicago. The Sheriff verified the sale. [This is the penalty for passing off Gabbys place as the Bar-X! Honesty is still the best policy.]

Roy and Gabby are arrested and put in jail! Bowman and Lacey are taking the cattle to Chicago. Can Roy and Gabby break jail? Yes. [What kind of example is Roy setting for his fans?] The Herefords are loaded into cattle cars. Now the Sheriff and his men are after Roy and Gabby. The train moves out. They show the stockyards of Chicago. The count checks. Roy fights with Bowman then pursues him. Gabby gets Lacey. Trigger helps too. The police arrive to take them all in. The Sheriff tells Roy about the fraud, the check wasn't good. What about his arthritis? The check for the cattle will be given to Dorothy. Bowman and Lacey will be held for the Utah Sheriff.

This is an entertaining drama with music and comedy. We see a rehearsal to entertain the audience. We see the sheepherders too! Then dancing girls. It must be a satire or parody on the usual Western with Roy deceiving Dorothy. Were there any other movies where Roy and Gabby are jail breakers? Everything is properly resolved at the end of this comedy. The famous Chicago stockyards would later be closed down so the processing is done closer to the source. Its cost-effective. I wonder what the air was like back of the yards? Sheep provide a renewable resource (wool) unlike the hides of cattle. Sheep also require a lower capital investment; they can be herded with dogs rather than humans. [This puts cowboys out of work due to outsourcing.]",1510531200,,3115,4.587073608617594
