8296307,5,B001E50RR6,Fascinating discussion concerning the student riots at UC Berkley from opposite viewpoints.  Mr Bickel is every bit the intellectual spokesperson for his philosophy as is Mr Buckley.,1386547200,,182,5.7407407407407405
8296308,4,B001E50RR6,This episode of firing line concerns the students of the sixties who had begun to act out.  Buckley effectively pins down his guest but fails to get his guest to see his logic.  This could be used as a study for why there remain problems with students today.,1368489600,,258,4.354166666666667
