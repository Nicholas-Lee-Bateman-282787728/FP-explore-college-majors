7882194,5,6305071764,"i first viewed flamenco women about 15 years ago on a flight from australia to england..
in fact i must have viewed it about 20 times.  being my favourite flamenco video of all time
i was disappointed to have lost my recorded copy after arriving back in australia.. it must have been
taped over.. amazon had the vhs copy and although it would have been wonderful to see it in dvd form,
i can soon fix that by having it converted.  it is a wonderful atmospheric video, you feel like you are
there with the dancers and it takes you from dance classes to highly professional and skilled dancers.
i even saw salma hayek in the audience.. everyone looked mesmerised.. thanks amazon.",1362182400,,677,4.540983606557377
7882195,5,6305071764,"For aficionados of Flamenco dance this is the ultimate film. No amateurs
here, only superb masters of the art. Both in the practice shown and the
final spectacle, we see these dancers at their best.  It is a film that
will be viewed over and over by those who are dazzled by these artists~",1282003200,,289,4.351851851851852
7882196,4,6305071764,"OK so the sound was not ""all that,"" but the overall concept is conveyed, 90% perspiration, 10% inspiration. Figgis depicts the various aspects of practice and study very well.  I would have liked to see more of the final performance, but I do not need to see the end product to understand the pre-performance work, which Mr. Figgis had captured throughout.  I have been and continue to be extremely fortunate in my musical performance life.  I have been to 100's of concerts and met many influencial Flamenco performers, and I found relief in the fact that FLAMENCO WOMEN shows a side of preperation that is not often seen, if at all.  It would have been nice to see more dancing from Yerbabuena & Baras, however, I did receive a short guitar passage from an ""Alegrias"" that Sara Baras conveyed to the musicians.  Very cool!",1154563200,,824,4.694444444444445
7882197,5,6305071764,"I have read with disappointment some customer reviews on Mike Figgis' documentary, Flamenco Women.  If you want a full bulerias, get a step by step dancing video.  If you want to see flamenco in the ""original"", get in a time machine and go back a few hundred years.  If you want to see a full dance just the way you think it should be - watch yourself in the mirror.  In this documentary, we see two artistic viewpoints - one from the women that came together for the performance, and the other by Figgis.  Flamenco a living art - it's supposed to change.  Get it!!  For what it is worth, in Australia we don't get a lot of flamenco performances, so I look for whatever I can get as well as having danced myself for many years - this documentary is one of the best I have seen - give it a go I say!",1082937600,5,798,4.109677419354838
7882198,1,6305071764,"Mike figgis paints a very distant and muffled picture of the true meaning of flamenco, with bad camera angles at times focasing in on facial expressions instead of full body shots which would capture both hand and foot coordination, not to mention the sound was distorted as well.
I was truely hoping to get more insight and more inspiration from this film.
Eva La Yerbabuena is by far my favorite flamenco dancer and this film showed only an ounce of what she is truely capable of. Though I did enjoy the dance rehearsals, it did nothing for me.
The performance at the end was not what I expected, being that many of the rehearsals were really good. I really didn't appreciate and was actually a little offended by the fashionable cotumes and dark make up. Flamenco is a tradional spanish dance that deserves to have its integrity kept in place. It does not change with time. The point I am trying to make is other then the dance itself one of the most important aspects of flamenco is how feminine and classic the women look as they dance.
A VERY important part of preserving the integrity of the dance.
yada yada yada!
This video? A disappointment to say the least. I will have to check out the video everyone has suggested.
An addendum:
Eva La Yerbabuena is featured in an IMAX film intitled ""Pulse"", her foot work is spectacular and well worth the $8.50 theater ticket. I suggest going to see that, if you are looking for inspiration.",1072569600,4,1439,4.5813953488372094
7882199,1,6305071764,"Sara Baras and Eva La Yerbabuena ostensibly rehearse for a performance, with some outtakes of studio work at Amor de Dios.  We see snippets of alegrias, bulerias and tangos with some nice footwork but no development,  not a single complete dance and the artistry of the ""Flamenco  Women"" is wholly smothered by the ineptitude of the filmmakers.  It  makes you realize what talent Carlos Saura has.",946944000,21,397,4.954545454545454
