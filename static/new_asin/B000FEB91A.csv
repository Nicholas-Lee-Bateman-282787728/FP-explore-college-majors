8174932,1,B000FEB91A,"This set was a great disappointment to me. I expected it to be a sort of historic travelogue. When I was young I watched a show about historic places in the US and it was fascinating. I thought this might be similar. I'd been wanting to buy it for some time and was looking forward to watching it. But the few I watched were just a collection of newsreels from wayback, 1940's and around there, with the normal poor quality of that time. The newsreels were quite short and nothing to do with each other so there was not even any continuity. I often couldn't see the connection between the newsreel and the title of the DVD. Also, one DVD for San Francisco actually had a DVD of Las Vegas in it, which I wasn't interetsed in. I plan to visit SF and NY next year and was hoping it would give me some background. No such luck. I don't know if I'll ever watch them all. The set is very expensive for what it is. Such a waste of money.",1317427200,,930,4.143646408839779
8174933,5,B000FEB91A,"I decided to purchase this DVD set because I'm planning on doing a cross country trip next year and wanted to find out what to see and do during my trip. I'm glad I did becasue teh films have clips on almost every type of tourist atraction and site there is between New York and California. I liked the Yellowstone Park footage the best, but the films about San Francisco and Los Angeles are also very strong. Some of the material is older, but I don't think the landmarks have changed that much over the years.",1148428800,,511,4.333333333333333
