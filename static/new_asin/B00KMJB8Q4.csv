8660125,5,B00KMJB8Q4,"... with the reviews of Carol Kort and Maxine.  I might add that I was highly impressed with how well researched this documentary was and the way that those interviewed were so frank about their ""Home on the Range"" and how they felt at the time and currently.  I think we should add AT LEAST one more star to the rating!  Thank you, Bonnie Burt, Judith Montell, your crew, and all those interviewed.  What a tremendous co-creation this is!",1424044800,,439,4.518987341772152
8660126,5,B00KMJB8Q4,"The story of the Jewish chicken ranchers who settled in Petaluma CA, is an essential but barely known part of American immigrant history. Bonnie Burt and Judith Montell have captured the importance of these courageous, articulate and determined people -- the ranchers who came West for agriculture instead of settling in East Coast cities  -- in a poignant and memorable film that made me laugh, cry, and realize how little I had known about the Jewish chicken farmers. The film reflects an unusual sensitivity so that we, the viewers, really understand who these people are, from their socialist politics (and the volatile disagreements that grew out of those beliefs) to their spirited love of the land and of each other As a creative endeavor (music, the interviews, the shots of the countryside) the film works in a multitude of way.

I was captivated by this film,  both because of the characters -- and boy are some of them characters! -- and the
history of the time period. I was sorry when the film ended and wanted to know what became of this group of bright, funny,salt-of-the-earth group of farmers. Thank you, Bonnie Burt and Judith Monteil, for making this superb film. It really does rate 5 stars!",1403136000,,1211,4.840579710144928
