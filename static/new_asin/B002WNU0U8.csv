There will be some spoilers ahead.

Boy, was this twisted, LOL.  How do I classify this?  Erotic horror... with a dash of bondage?  I swear this rates 5 stars for all the deliciously campy and debauched ideas here... but none of it plays out as good as you'll want it to be... it's a high 2-range execution, at best. Though interesting in some spots.  But what really killed it is the choice of leads and their lack of real chemistry.  When it got right down to it the f/f sex scenes were kind of awful, lol... like they were posing for the camera the whole time, LOL... all that Dracula music didn't make it any sexier, either...

So an attractive young blonde on the cusp of 18 is pretty much home-schooled captive in a large creepy mansion with her sorta kinda mad-scientist father.  Her mother is dead and he's got some weird letting go issues on the wifey he's projecting onto his daughter.  So he's unnaturally possessive and keeps her isolated.  (Just a touch of implied incest there, I think.)  She, in turn, is a lonely and unhappy lover of poetry who longs to escape and go to college.

Suddenly there is this big jump in the story... Lucille has attempted suicide and somehow there is a fire (?) and she ends up with third-degree burns on her face. But we don't see any of that and some of their English accents are so bad I think I'm missing some information to boot.  She's suddenly in bed all mummy-wrapped and mute.  Her father sets out to heal her at home with some experimental skin graphs and he hires a personal nurse for her... Hot Nurse Joan with a questionable history.  Now Joan is lovely enough... but this nurse shoulda had big boobs, I tell ya.

Nurse Joan bonds with the traumatized and submissive Lucille by holding her unnaturally close (bigger boobs would have enhanced these scenes tremendously)... she gives the mute Lucille erotic sponge baths and lustful kisses.  Poor catatonic roadkill mummified Lucille... she loved it, bwahaha...  I think these scenes are the best part of the film.  It was so perversely wrong, lol.  Yet it's strangely erotic and they actually have some interesting chemistry here.  And it brings the lonely and depressed Lucille back to life.  This is the first person Lucille has the chance to love and now she has a reason to get well and to live.

Suddenly Lucille is no longer mute?  Wasn't there some mention of paralysis as well??  I don't know.  But suddenly she's getting too beautiful again.  And her voice is loud and awful and it just destroys the darkly erotic tone.  (This film accomplished so much with silence or with minor sounds and certain sensual scenes.)  But Lucille gets too well... healthy people don't interest Joan too much.  This severely irritates Lucille and a little drama and power play ensues. Again, not as sexy as it could have been.  But I loved the ideas.

There are a couple of sex scenes the last half hour or so.  It's pretty graphic stuff... the horror, not so much.  Well, there are some icky scabby skin-related scenes.  If Darkman didn't frighten you, this won't either.  Mostly this is pretty tame stuff.

Such wasted potential-- though I kinda loved it for what it strived to be.  If only Keira Michelle Telford would novelize this one and bring some erotic literacy to these crazy ideas and tell it right... hot older nurse and beautiful young patient is so up her alley...

Not one to run out and buy (find it on YT), but I couldn't stop watching it just to see what kind of weird stuff would come up. heh.",1425686400,,3520,4.5696

8383245,1,B002WNU0U8,"Let me start by saying, I own over 5000 DVD movies. I really enjoy a good movie and my collection includes the old classics to today's top hits. I also have several boxes with movies I consider a complete waste of my time. This movie is now in that collection. A waste of my time. I wish I could give a review but after watching this movie, my brain reacted like my DVR *Delete* iI have no memory  of this movie except, it's in a box'!  ""banished""
The check Mark to verify that this was an amazon purchase did not appear for me to check if of, yet I received an email asking would I like to review this movie. I'm baffled.",1318291200,,622,4.090163934426229
8383246,3,B002WNU0U8,"before i finally decided to watch this, i only had 2 user-reviews to go by: 1 on amazon and 1 on imdb.com.  both rated it poorly.  a few ""professional"" reviewers on the web gave it good marks and they(as well as the back of the box) implied it was a ""gothic"" horror film of sorts with a forbidden lesbian love angle.  being an exploitation-horror fan, i found it hard to resist that combo.  i should've listened to the two user-reviewers.  this is for others who might be tempted.  you can find the synopsis anywhere so...

1. i didn't find anything really scary, suspenseful, creepy, atmospheric, or gross(a few minor surgical scenes might qualify) about the movie.  it never really builds up to anything horrific, whether it was weak character development or storytelling i'm not sure but i never felt any  real tension while watching this.  2. those more interested in the erotic/lesbian/sex aspect of the film, you do get a bit of the eroticism throughout due to the sexual tension between the 2 female leads here and there, but not much.  as for the lesbian sex, you only get 2 scenes(un-rated-type scenes but only one of them is good imo) and they both happen in the last 1/3 of the film.

as a movie its ok/average, as a sexploitation horror it's poor.  my 3-star rating is grading it as a movie in and of itself.  if i rated it on my pre-conceptions or expectations i would've given it a 2, but that would be unfair to the film(plus i don't want to get yelled at by fans of the film who might accuse me of having the movie go over my head).  anyway the dvd is nice: widescreen, ""original english version"" of film, photo gallery, 2 trailers, and a text bio of the director.  btw, the box cover proudly displays some of its awards at film festivals, so apparently the merits of the film did go over my head.",1306454400,3,1813,4.4650455927051675
