Skip, Hotsauce, and AO are still killing defenders and the dunkers are still doing awesome dunks especially main event. So go ahead and get the tape and you want regret it. Its one of the best yet.",1029542400,3,406,4.355263157894737
1716097,3,B000067J2V,"I own the DVD of Volumes 1 - 4 collected and now Vol. 5.  I can't say which volume is the best, but 5 isn't it.  If you have never seen any of the And 1 Mixtapes, pick this one up to see some sick handles, dimes, and dunks, but if you've seen And 1 Mixtapes before, there is nothing remarkable here.",1027555200,5,299,3.806451612903226
1716098,5,B000067J2V,Man as soon as I finsh watching it I had to go and cross somebody over and then duck on them. It has all the legends in it plus some new peeps. It also has more moves and dunks. But there is one girl on there and boy the things she can do with a ball just buy and see it is off the HOOK.,1027468800,,287,3.4307692307692306

7963052,3,B000067J2V,"Overall, this video was good for the moves featured, but, it wasn't very long, and the segemnt on skip to my lou wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be. I would purchase this item again though, because it shows how streetball moves are executed and its funny to watch some of the people go for the fakes.",1126051200,,305,4.1
7963053,5,B000067J2V,I think this is And 1's first DVD. If so then they did a good job. If this was just a video then it would [be bad]. Also this one features the return of Rafer Alston a.k.a Skip To My Lou. Volume 6 is coming out real soon so watch this for adrenaline (or tips heh heh heh).,1059004800,2,272,3.706896551724138
7963054,3,B000067J2V,"Nothing really new here, maybe a move or two. If you have the older volumes it's not worth buying this one.",1053734400,,107,4.142857142857143
7963055,3,B000067J2V,"What was so money about the early And1 MixTapes was the fact that only the few hardcore ball fans knew about them. When the And1 crew rolled into town, cameras in tow, local ballers simply had no idea. When it would be all said and done, the crew would leave local ball wizards with crushed egos, broken ankles and an everlasting fear of playing D with their legs too wide apart.
  The series peaked in ability in Volumes 3 and 4 with the significant additions of Philly product Aaron ""AO"" Owens, and an introduction into the twisted but spectacularly dazzling world of Phillip ""Hot Sauce"" Champion, who would grow to rival And1 godfather Rafer ""Skip 2 My Lou"" Alston in mainstream popularity. By the release of the fourth volume and the collector's DVD, much of the ball world had been exposed to or knew of the And1 antics: the ball around the head, through your legs, under his shirt, behind the back pinned between the elbows.
  This proves to be the downfall of Volume 5. Most of the ballers on tape are simply out to pull of their moves, with no attention to defense (which has never been much of a part to these tapes). This takes a lot of luster off of the moves on tape; it's much more astounding to see Hot Sauce put the ball around an opponent trying his hardest to steal the ball than to see a slacker pay for not playing hard enough. However, the level of competition in Volume 5's games rivals that of the last game of the night at the rec center--everyone's jogging down and letting one-on-one no help D games develop.
  The video does provide a well-needed dose of ""Skip"" Alston, whose home videos kicked off the series in Volume 1. This time, his magnetic ball handling skills are captured from multiple angles on higher resolution cameras. Even in a trick-level game, it's still impressive to see Skip change directions with the ball behind his back only using his left hand; or whipping circles in and around his body before serving a blind dish to a cutting teammate. Also notable is the footage of locals playing each other, where some pride and dignity in playing D and trying to stop the other guy still exist.
  It's not a must have like the collectors edition 1-4 MixTape; there aren't any significant moves to make you want to rewind and rewind and rewind and still scratch your head. Volume 5 is like a slightly different retelling of an old joke; everyone knows what's gonna happen, and everyone's just pushing for the punchline, but it just isn't as good as the first time you heard it.",1052265600,11,2515,4.5364238410596025
7963056,5,B000067J2V,This is agreat movie for allen iverson lovers also it is a team of lebron james but better this is a great deal for a great street ball fan This the greatest and  the best movie of all time with sik wit it and skip to my lou and hot sauce and the dribling machine and 50 and flash,1047340800,,280,3.7457627118644066
7963057,3,B000067J2V,"The mixtape is pretty tight...I've seen all 5 of the mixtapes and this isn't the best one.  It's sweet when Main Event does a 360 windmill on a guy, and when this girl made a guy fall.  But those are the only two awesome things if you've seen the other tapes.  No new moves in this tape.  But if you're a newbie to teh mixtape game...get this one",1037923200,3,346,4.044117647058823
7963058,4,B000067J2V,"In the latest installment of the mixtape series, volume 5 continues the tradition of sick handles and unreal dunks, but offers nothing new to the bball public.  The music for this mixtape is tight, but the dvd doesn't offer as much extras like the Collecter's Edition DVD Vol 1-4.  This is a good buy for those who like to collect the mixtapes, and those who have never seen the and1 mixtapes before.
PS-Keep your eyes peeled for the girl with ankle-breaking crossover in vol. 5.",1032480000,11,479,4.623529411764705
7963059,4,B000067J2V,"Loaded with the hypest streetballin' moves ever, this DVD is certainly one worth owning.  Whether you're a weekend warrior, hardcore baller, or just sit on you fat ... watching hoops all day, this DVD is an inspiration to get up and ball out!
I would've given this disk a straight ""5"", but the DVD mastering is a little weak... it coulda been done better with a PowerMac & iDVD in somebody' basement.  That notwithstanding, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this disk to hoops fans everywhere!  Stop reading... buy it.
PS- watch the chick break some dude's ankles... HARD!  Worth rewinding & watching twice!  :-)",1031443200,4,597,4.813725490196078
7963060,5,B000067J2V,"Now I won't go out and say this is the best AND1 tape, it's probably one of them, well theres only 5, but still manages to make you laugh and wonder who they do it, whether it's someone getting a shot swatted, a girl dropping one of AND1's players, or a hand stand while dribbling the ball this has it all, even a bit of freestyle and humour in the supermarket, i would say AND1 volume 4 is the best out of all of them but this is pretty tight, with good music by artist like Styles and Fabolous you'll be banging your head while watching this, as all the AND1 tapes have well produced songs, I'd say the best songs are Soul Clap and the song Fabolous spit, I'm not sure of the name. But you need this in your collection, it's pretty hard to find on the streets, well if you live outside of America, so get this and trust me, you won't be dissapointed.",1030320000,3,852,4.107784431137724
