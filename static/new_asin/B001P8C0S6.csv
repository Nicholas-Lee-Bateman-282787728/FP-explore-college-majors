I was dissappointed to find the concert is less than a dozen songs, but suppose it is setup to produce a one hour Soundstage broadcast.  In any case, I would rather hear 10 great songs than to hear a 20 song concert with lots of meaningless songs thrown in.  The 2 additional tracks in the bonus section are equally well done.  This blu-ray DVD is definitely a keeper for my collection!",1243468800,4,514,4.666666666666667
3742476,5,B001P8C0S6,"I just happened to see this dvd on a display at Sears, and wanted to purchase it, but I don't have the Blu-ray format.  However, I knew I wanted the dvd, because I'd seen him perform some of the songs on tv, and I already own the cd.  I told a friend of mine about it -- they have Blu-ray.  Anyway, They bought the dvd, because I kept raving about it.  Well, WOW!  It was sooo good! I absolutely love it.  Until I heard Seal's Soul album, I knew nothing about his music.  But once I heard this, I knew I'd be checking out more of his work.  But it was seeing him perform live that really did it for me.  He gives a rich performance.  His energy and passion, along with his distictive sound, and the camera work, really come together to create a 5 star performance!  I just want it to be released in regular dvd format.  I'd buy it today!  Oh, the dvd does not contain every song on the cd, although I wish it did.  But it is still a top notch show.  The stage design is beautiful, the picture quality is incredible.  I've already watched it 3 times, back to back, and I'm searching now for a standard dvd vrsion, if it's available.  This is a well produced show.  If I could change anything, it would be to add all the songs from the album, and make it available on standard dvd format.  The songs on the cd and dvd are 1960's feel good favorites.",1237248000,4,1347,4.111538461538461

8332503,1,B001P8C0S6,"I absolutely loved this show on PBS. Was very disappointed
it was not produced on regular DVD.  I did buy the CD but
missed seeing the real performance.  He was electric.
Hope the producers release it on DVD someday soon. There
is a market for it.",1374019200,,247,4.3478260869565215

WRONG REGION
Other stuff with the same warning has played in Oz but not this one
I sourced it elsewhere and its a great live set by Seal",1348444800,,222,3.847826086956522
8332505,1,B001P8C0S6,I ordered this from Amazon. It arrived today and does not play in my PS3 (Australia) nor my Samsung Blu Ray Player. I loved Seal's songs on HITMAN 2 (David Foster) and hence ordered it. No where on this site does it say that it is a Region A Blu Ray.,1318809600,,250,3.9215686274509802
8332506,5,B001P8C0S6,This I have played over 30 times.  It's outstanding!  I also purchased the CD as gifts to friends.  I didn't know Seal could get off like that.  Very good show!,1289865600,,160,4.233333333333333
8332507,5,B001P8C0S6,"I am not one to harp on things, but this bluray disc with SEAL singing the standards from the Soul album is simply incredible.  To place the visual with the audible in a music dvd is always an incredible experience, but this one is much more powerful.  This is a must buy, if you love music and if you enjoy SEAL.  You will find yourself lifted when he sings ""A Change Is Gonna Come"", all the way to the end when he does his first hit, ""Crazy"".  You will enjoy it.",1286668800,,464,4.065934065934066
8332508,1,B001P8C0S6,"Not what I wanted in the way of a Seal Blue Ray DVD, but oh well.  Would like to see and hear his standards on a Blue Ray DVD, but I don't believe there's one available.",1266364800,,169,3.6944444444444446
8332509,5,B001P8C0S6,"I was lucky enough to find a this Blu-Ray at a second-hand store... as with Seal's live DVD, the performance, picture and sound are all first rate!
Highly Recommended...
Give us more Seal on Blu-Ray please...",1243900800,,208,4.805555555555555
8332510,5,B001P8C0S6,One of the best DVD concerts ever... Put on the surround sound and its just like Seal is in your living room. We put it on when we have gatherings and everyone even the kids LOVE IT!!!,1243641600,,184,4.0
