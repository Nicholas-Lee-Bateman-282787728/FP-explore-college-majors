8268831,1,B00188NXMU,"Screenwriter Charles Leavitt fabricated an incident alleging that racist fans launched verbal attacks on Ernie Davis during Syracuse's game at West Virginia University.  Small problem: the incident didn't take place.  When WV folks pointed this out, Leavitt's supposed ""apology"" was full of more lies.  His new story was that """"the scene was supposed to depict a 1958 game at Tar Heels Stadium in North Carolina.""  Well... Syracuse didn't play North Carolina in football until 1995.  Ernie Davis didn't play varsity until 1959 (freshman were ineligible in 1958).  North Carolina's stadium is called ""Kenan Memorial"", not ""Tar Heels"".

So the writer has gone from slandering one southern University to slandering another.  That's totally unacceptable.",1224806400,,750,5.575221238938053
8268832,4,B00188NXMU,"Do we really need another movie about the real life experiences of the ""first black person or team"" to do something?  First football this, first debate team, first swim team, first to go here, first to go there?

Well, yes, even though the genre is indeed stereotypical and usually the movie has to include a lot of melodrama, I'd still say yes, as long as it's well done, the subject is a moving theme and the lesson's need to be shared with the youth of today; America has become a different place than it was in 1950, and history is history, whether beautiful or ugly.

I had never heard of Ernie Davis before this film, not being a huge sports buff, especially when it comes to college football.  But it didn't matter; the movie was still entertaining and moving.  I took a group of young teen agers to see the flick and they all enjoyed the movie a lot, to some it was quite moving.

Now in critique, the movie got a bit melodramatic in places, I'm sure that football fans got angry and mean (as depicted), I'm not denying that part of history, but did they really shower the team with what seemed like hundreds of bottles, shattered glass flying everywhere?  Did the other team really jump Ernie Davis after a tackle and simply beat him with their fists unstopped by the referee's?  I'm not doubting that these things happened, I'm just thinking that the film over did the scene's so that the reality of what actually happened was replaced by a depiction that was pushed too far.

I suppose that the main complaint is that the movie came across as formulaic, and the character wasn't really fleshed out well.  The character played by Cuba Gooding Jr. in that ""first black diver"" movie is a good contrast; I felt like that guy really came across as a unique person in that flick (perhaps as a result of Cuba's great acting ability) but that this character, the real character of Davis wasn't quite shown, rather a caricature was put in place, the heart of gold black man with tremendous talent fighting his way in a white dominated world.

It may be that because Davis (this is a bit of a spoiler, but since it's based on a true story I'll continue) died when he was so young, it wasn't easy to come up with a real version of him that was ""true to life"" beyond the basics of his story.  That may be the case, I'm not really criticizing the acting in the movie, it wasn't bad at all, it just goes back to the fact that that the whole thing was a bit cookie cutter and predictable.

In any case, I do recommend this film; it's well suited for young teens, even pre-teens if they have an interest in football and stories of overcoming struggle.",1224633600,,2646,4.419753086419753
8268833,3,B00188NXMU,"There's no doubt that Ernie Davis led an inspirational and tragically moving life, yet the formulaic presentation and stereotypical structure to the motivational sports drama doesn't provide an appropriately unique platform to tell his story. Perhaps his life is the epitome of the genre, but we've seen this same tale numerous times only with different sports and slightly different obstacles. The Express does an exemplary job of recreating an era and a football legend with plenty of heart and exciting action, but an overlong running time and an over-attentiveness to specific dates and historical accuracy diminishes the entertainment and amps up the documentary vibe.

Ever since he was a young boy growing up in Pennsylvania, Ernie Davis was forced to overcome harsh adversity, and perhaps the greatest came when he was recruited to play college football for Syracuse. The Express chronicles the tragically short, yet monumentally accomplished life of the first African-American to ever win the Heisman Trophy.

All the actors involved portrayed their respective real-life characters with enthusiasm and charisma aplenty, however far too many seemed included just to fill a stereotypical role in such films. Since it's based on a true story, perhaps all of these people really existed. Dennis Quaid gives a notable hard-edged, tough-coach-with-a-heart-of-gold performance who admirably avoids too many lengthy inspirational speeches, yet still manages to breach the trying-too-hard to act tough line at a few points throughout the film.

Once again Hollywood has churned out an inspirational sports drama with that winning blend of feel-good momentum and underdog accomplishments. Although the sport keeps changing, the formula stays the same, and so the significance of this based-on-a-true-story adaptation feels overdone and imitative. Realistic, well-acted, but ultimately more of the same tried-and-true storytelling, The Express is a perfect movie-going experience for those who know exactly what the film is all about before watching it.
