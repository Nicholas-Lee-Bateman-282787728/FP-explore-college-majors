Splatter is a great Shot on Video films released in 1986 that was actually aired on public television in Canada that ended up in court (due to its ""Adult Content""), it won the outcome since it is an educational film

Special Features include an audio commentary with the Producer, Film review by Paul Zamarelli of VHSCollector.com, Photo Gallery, an Interview with Bill Smith (Producer), and the film trailer.",1447891200,,617,4.747663551401869
8727179,5,B013C6OTTQ,"This is the SOV gem you've been waiting for.

SAOF is more of a mockumentary of the making of a fake horror movie with real behind-the-special effects segments.  You got plenty of blood, '80's synth music, nudity, an odd host named FANG, and lots of SOV grime.

Sure, some of the segments get kind of onerous once you've seen the same scene over and over again as special effects are explained, but it's still a lot of fun, and the commentary is a blast.  This is a great piece of VHS film history that must be seen by hardcore horror fans.

Someone expecting a normal horror movie will be disappointed.

SOV fans 5/5
General population 2/5
SOV virgins 3-4/5

If you've seen a few SOV horror movies and crave more, this title is a great next step.",1447891200,,747,4.408759124087592
8727180,1,B013C6OTTQ,"I loved the ""movie"" Splatter.  Cheesy 80s crap, but that's why I bought it.  Unfortunately, it won't work in any of my DVD players.  I suspect a faulty mastering of the DVD.  There were no scratches or obvious physical defects.  I was able to rip it to the hard drive and watch it (could probably burn it to a DVD-R, too), so I didn't bother with a return.  The DVD is worth far less than my time.",1295568000,,397,4.090909090909091
8727181,4,B013C6OTTQ,"A nice movie and finally on DVD. I know this movie from VHS and it was a real fun trash movie with cheap f/x. But I liked that kind of movies. I was happy when I read that this movie was finally released on DVD. With no big company behind the release, I was a little bit scared about the quality. But when I got the DVD and saw that movie I recognized that it was ok. The part that I not like so mch on that release is that there are no bonus material as well as no CC or Subtitels.",1250726400,,482,3.735294117647059
8727182,2,B013C6OTTQ,"Splatter: The Architects of Fear (Peter Rowe, 1986)

Another mockumentary, though I have to admit that I was unsure whether it was real or not for the first bit there. Basically, it promises behind-the-scenes footage of a special effects crew on the set of a really awful-looking movie (no one said they were a good special effects crew) pitting a tribe of Amazons against a tribe of mutants. And I will add my voice to the throng who have said that if anyone ever does make the Amazon vs. mutant movie, I will pay good hard cash to see it, because it looks so godawfully bad that it's almost guaranteed to be another of those flicks like Bloody Pit of Horror that's so bad you can't stop watching once you've started.

Like American Zombie above, while it plays the straight mockumentary line, this is a lot of fun, and the fact that it's satire comes through pretty solidly by the time you've seen the way they do a few things (it's the FX equivalent of trying to build Rex Feral's silencer. And if you don't get the reference, look it up). But the makers of this film must have thought they were being too subtle, because then we meet Fang, and any lingering credibility the film might have had goes out the window. That might not have been the case had this actually been funny or had the guy playing Fang been a decent enough actor to pull this off. Neither of these things is the case, and the footage that doesn't involve the team building effects quickly gets old.

It's worth seeing for the mockumentary parts, but prepare your fast-forward thumb for a workout. **",1245974400,,1573,4.493006993006993
