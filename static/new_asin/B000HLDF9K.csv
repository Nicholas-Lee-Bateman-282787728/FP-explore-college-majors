2639103,5,B000HLDF9K,this would have to be one of the best dvds i seen on sperm whales highly recommended compulsive viewing it certainly gave me huge insight on what sperm whales  get up too its da bomb,1220572800,,182,4.2
2639104,4,B000HLDF9K,"I saw half of this on the Discovery Channel but was forced to leave it. So I rented it to see the last half.  Then I bought a copy from Amazon for my nephew.

This is the life story of a male sperm whale.  It is mostly CGI, but the representations of the whales and other deep sea animals are really spot on.  (I have been intersted in marine environments for over 20 years, so I am reasonably familiar with the topic.) There were even a few animals I had never heard of, like the oarfish.  It also shows what the deep ocean floors must look like, and how many animals feed there.  I had no idea.

There is even quite a bit of good information on whale biology and their adaptations to extreme ocean environments, but it doesn't seem boring or like a lecture. I was a bit annoyed by the obligatory mention of the threat to whales by global warning. That was the only fantasy involved, in my opinion. At least they mentioned the threat of overfishing and deep ocean dredging, which IS a real environmental disaster.  Other than that, there was no minute I didn't enjoy.

While some children might enjoy it, there is quite a bit of death that might bother sensitive people.  The documentary opens with the main character whale dying of old age, washed up on a shore being admired by people.  The people are trying to help him. Seeing him next to humans gives the viewer an idea of his size, and reminds the viewer that these amazing animals are really out there.

The remainder of the program shows what his life must have been like.

*** a few soilers below ***

This includes some attacking killer whales who bite his tail, his aunt drowning underwater because she became entangled in a deep ocean cable, his baby sister starving when their mothing died, a whaling scene, and a shinking ship scene in which people drown.  It ends with more scenes of the whale dying, but mentions that he had a good life, living to 60 or 70 years.

*** end spoilers ***

A parent might want to consider how much their child is capable of dealing with death before showing it.  But buy it anyway, and just save it till your child is older. It is a really amazing story with very realistic graphics.

One star off for the global warming bit, but 5 stars otherwise.",1200096000,,2245,4.39225181598063
2639105,5,B000HLDF9K,"I have a library of nature oriented DVDs -- yet this one really stands out for its overall story line, asthetics and beauty.  I had imagined the story to get old, but the journeys documented in this DVD are varied enought to capture my imagination.  Only in the ""attack of the giant squid"" scene does the digital animation seem awkward. This movie is worthy of a second, or third watching, great for family and will stand out as a gift (stocking stuffer) for a family member or friend.  At the listed price it is a bargain.",1194739200,,523,4.427083333333333
2639106,5,B000HLDF9K,"I really liked this video.  It told a story about a subject (whales). The focus was on the whales and not some individual telling the story. If you want a documentary, this may be the closest you get thousands of feet below the oceans. Good video.",1194220800,,247,4.369565217391305

""A sperm whale lies stranded close to death.  To look at him now, it's hard to imagine what an extraordinary life he's led.  This is the largest predator the world has ever seen.  His home is the abyss.  He's spent most of his life at a staggering 2 kilometers [about 1 1/4 miles] beneath the [ocean's] waves, only surfacing to breath.

Our technology has given us the briefest glimpse of [the ocean's] alien landscape.  But what if we could see it as [the sperm whale] sees it?  It would be like turning on the lights in a world of external darkness.  Down here, mountains rise higher than [Mt.] Everest, ravines run deeper than the Grand Canyon, and the creatures are more monstrous than anything found on land.

This film lights up the deep.  It tells the story of one whale's 80-year journey from calf to King of the Abyss.

Welcome to the ultimate ocean odyssey!""

This is how the first episode (1 hr., 8 scenes) of this mesmerizing two-episode documentary begins.  Both episodes are narrated by actor Bernard Hill, whose deep voice adds a mysteriousness to the film.

And what a two-episode film it is!!  The viewer gets to see strange underwater sea creatures such as giant squids, colossal squids (the ""beasts of sailor's legends""), bioluminescent creatures, Orcas (killer whales), and Tube Worms.  We see battles the sperm whale has with its predators and with other sperm whales.  Perhaps, the most interesting is that we get to see the ocean bottom or marinescape, truly an ""alien landscape"" with its ""Lost City,"" its ridges of volcanic mountains, its ""Curtain of Fire,"" and its steaming underwater vents (that provide energy without sunlight).

Episode two (1 hr., 8 scenes) continues where episode one left off but this time with the sperm whale all grown up and ""ready to travel further and dive deeper than any other creature on Earth, facing new dangers in an ocean that [humans] are changing.""

The computer animation is fantastic.  You can't tell the images are computer generated.  Besides computer animation, there's life-action footage and historical real-life footage.  Besides being entertained, you'll also learn a lot since recent scientific information is presented.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2006) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are no extras.

In conclusion, this is an unforgettable film, both entertaining and educational, that made a ""big splash"" with me.  Sadly, ""by 1969, we knew more about the lifeless surface of the moon than we did about the deep oceans of our own planet.""  This is still the case.  This film changes that.  In fact,

""This is the closest you'll get to seeing what lies thousands of feet below the ocean's surface!!""

2639108,4,B000HLDF9K,"It is difficult to believe sometimes that you are not looking at underwater photography most of the time.  The documentary is mostly very believable.  The only part that pushes the limits of (in fact, goes lightyears beyond) credibility is the final few minutes where it attempts to promote fear of the results of global warming by showing an American subburb completely underwater with a whale swimming between houses and over cars still parked in the driveways.  I mean, get real! The water level increases by fractions of an inch per year - plenty of time to move that car further inland, if not the whole house, eh?  And if the water got that deep at the rate the oceans are rising today, you wouldn't recognize anything because of the ocean life that would have covered it.  Unless you believe that global warming will cause the oceans to rise 50 feet in one hour (Noah, come back!) - that tiny part of the movie is pure propaganda.  Let's stick to science in these videos.  Nevertheless, throw out the bones and enjoy the fish. It is a great movie.",1183507200,4,1054,4.60427807486631
2639109,5,B000HLDF9K,for another brilliant attempt to educate the public about the world we live in.  Kudos.  So well done.,1178928000,5,102,4.611111111111111
2639110,4,B000HLDF9K,"Ocean Odyssey is awesome. There has never been a documentary that deals with the life history of whales. The documentary goes indepth in to the 80 year life of a sperm whale, know as ""the bull"".

From Infancy to Twilight, we see the ocean thru ""the bull's eyes"". Facinating, and from the same folks who did the Walking with series. CG animation mixed with actual footage make an amazing mix. The only problem with the content is that some of the social interactions between sperm whales is incorrect, or otherwise out dated.

Interestingly, a segment is devoted to Mesonychotuethis, the recently named ""Colossal Squid"". Okay, well watch it, and you'll enjoy it.",1176508800,7,661,4.892857142857143
2639111,5,B000HLDF9K,"If you like the ""Walking With"" series, you'll love Ocean Odyssey. But for someone like me who hasn't seen a ""Walking With"" and doesn't feel particularly motivated to glory in the gigantic extinct saurians or their hairy, club-wielding mammal conquerors, well, Ocean Odyssey blew me away.

This world is not extinct and millennias old. This world is not light years away. This world is right here, right now: the highest mountains in the world, the most volatile volcanic activity, and creatures larger than brontosauruses and Tyrannosaures Rex. Squids three times longer than your car fight sperm whales bigger than your upstairs rooms. Animals whom we see only as skeletons in the museum or glistening, air-blowing humps are brought to life in 3-D. Their dark underwater world is lit up for our depressingly human eyes by the imagined view of an animal with powerful sonar. The sperm whale sees thousands of feet ahead through the murky waters where light doesn't reach, and the plant life and wildlife survive on the heat only from the core's molten activity.

The epic tale, a true odyssey, is told in two segments of one sperm whale bull who lives from the birth of man's Industrial Age into the 21st century. He travels farther than any land-borne creature in all of the world's history, traversing the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Horn of Africa and then up into the freezing water and seemingly impenetrable ice of the slowly melting Antarctic icecap. He is protected by adults, off to fight and protect himself in young adulthood, and then off to fight off other comers to mate to make sure the end of his life, beached on the New Zealand coast, is not the end of his DNA.

This is a world that's real and happening every day, but we will never see it in our lifetimes, a world where light doesn't penetrate, but the most epic combat is fought and lives are lived.

NOTE: Amazon is pairing this with my favorite documentary series of recent time: Life in the Undergrowth. Ocean Odyssey brings to life a world we can't see because we're too small and weak; Undergrowth brings to life a world we can't see because we're too big. Both are mind-altering visions.",1166400000,19,2172,4.753315649867374
2639112,5,B000HLDF9K,Best whale film ever. I have watched this many times and sent copies to my nephews hoping they would find the world of marine biology as fascinating as I have.

2639114,5,B000HLDF9K,"I bought this nature special because it was narrated by fine actor Bernard Hill (Lord of the Rings, The Boys and Girl From County Clare). But anyone thinking this will just be some boring footage of whales splashing around are in for a shock. The two-part series takes the viewer into a world where the camera can never follow. Using advanced computer-generated landscapes, you follow the whales into deepsea trenches, forbidding ice caves, geothermal vents, and shipwrecks. They mix real footage of whales with the computer-generated work that could never be filmed. See the mighty battles with colossal squid! Thrill to attacks by killer whales!

There is also an over-arching story of a whale that beaches itself on New Zealand, and how this whale's long life has taken it across two oceans. Anyone who has seen ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" will understand the intent of this special. And if it makes you appreciate our fellow mammals a little bit more, then the filmmakers have done their job. A great show!",1334016000,,1007,4.958579881656805
2639115,3,B000HLDF9K,"This is a couple hours of computer animated documentary about ocean's topography. Since it is computer generated, everything is almost one colour in different shades so it was very uncomfortable to the eye. I am more interested in HD cinematography like the BBC Earth collection so this did not cut it for me but the producer deserves credit since it is educational. There is no stupid loud music and the narrator speaks clearly.",1328659200,2,429,4.890410958904109
2639116,5,B000HLDF9K,"I love documentaries of all types. All genre's in consideration, this is one of the most well done documentaries I have ever seen. Beautiful story, fascinating topic (the mighty Sperm Whale!), thorough presentation, and very good CGI to enhance the the viewers understanding (not overdone). I am now fascinated with sperm whales due to this documentary. Thank you BBC for opening my eyes once again to a world I did no know existed!
  That being said, AMAZON PLEASE MAKE THIS A DIGITAL DOWNLOAD! I want to buy this and have it all the time to show people! Please!!! Please!!! Please!!!",1316217600,,585,4.84
2639117,3,B000HLDF9K,"When I saw that this was created by the makers of the ""walking with"" series, it was a no-brainer to pick it up. It's a fantastic series and I own them all (except Cavemen, looked pretty lame, to me) and what I love about them is how they make prehistoric creatures feel so real, as if they were being filmed just like you would film living creatures today. That is also why this sounded very appealing to me, filming the parts of a sperm-whale's life that we can't see.

It's a neat idea, and it makes for a pretty neat program. There are only a couple of things that bother me though, the main one being the camera-work. Many shots they make using the CGI whales, are impossible to film, and no I don't mean because of the depth. Whether they're swimming on the ocean floor or near the surface, there are many times where they will fly right up to the camera and nearly knock into in, or even swallow it. These kinds of images detract from the realism for me, because they can't be real, so they must be CG. I'd rather not be reminded of that. That is an aspect that I always loved about the ""walking with"" programs, they were filmed just as a documentary would be today.

The other thing is that, as another reviewer pointed out, since you can compare the CG whales to the real ones, it makes them look a little less real. Also, the CG environments that they're in don't look completely real, they sort of look like miniatures being filmed with a small camera. Still, though, there are some shots that look very convincing, and the footage of the live whales is great.

As a whole, the program is still very enjoyable and interesting. The complaints that I have listed above, while do sound rather harsh, do not a program break. The information and the life of the bull sperm-whale they follow from calf to adult are very well done. The animation is in no way terrible, it just could have been handled in a more realistic manner...

This review isn't meant to discourage potential buyers though; it's still worth picking up. (especially if you already like the ""walking with"" series) Despite its flaws, this is still a good documentary, recommended to anyone with an interest in ocean-life.",1254614400,4,2192,4.5
2639118,3,B000HLDF9K,"For whatever reason, this DVD just isn't as exciting as the ""Walking With..."" series. Perhaps it's because Sperm Whales are living animals, while Dinosaurs are extinct. As such, sometimes I found myself criticizing the CGI since I could compare it to a real whale. I also felt this documentary was a bit long, and at times seems to be just one long swim in the ocean without any variation (except the end, with the giant squid). Furthermore, given the fact that we've since recorded giant squid on film, this movie seems a bit dated even though it's only a few years old. It's still worth renting if you're interested in Sperm Whales, but definitely not necessary for your wildlife collection.",1252886400,,693,4.783333333333333
2639119,5,B000HLDF9K,I saw this programme here in New Zealand last year on TV & thought it was brilliant.

2639121,5,B000HLDF9K,"This 1-disc DVD comprises 2 episodes, each one-hour in length.  The two episodes are a fictional recreation of the life of a male sperm whale that was found beached on a shore in New Zealand in 2004, and whose life was estimated to be over 80 years old.  Outside of the scenes involving humans, the rest of the show is CGI, and incredibly realistic CGI at that.  The scenes involving humans are those on the beach, and also include scenes on some ships, such as whaling vessels.  The story starts with the whale's birth in the early 20th century, and progresses to his death in 2004.  During this time, the show follows the whale's journey around the world, and in encounters with various ocean life, such as oarfish, orcas, giant squid, toothfish, etc...  Besides following the whale's life, the show also examines how humans have affected the world's oceans.  Overall, a great nature show.",1227571200,,891,4.746753246753247

8140378,5,B000HLDF9K,"I liked this 2006 BBC produced documentary film a lot - in fact even more, I was IMPRESSED by it!

This is the story of 80-years of life of a bull sperm whale, beginning the day of its birth and ending by... well, you will have to discover it by yourself. When our ""hero"" is born, the world is still recovering from World War I, but for most of the sea creatures human affairs are of little concern - except when whalers appear... Our hero will live its long and eventful life mostly far from humanity and its concerns - instead it will explore the dark depths of the oceans...

During the 116 minutes of this film we can follow the main character as it matures and grows, learns the secrets of sea, its creatures and the life itself. As it can dive deeper and deeper we keep discovering more things and thanks to the absolutely incredible CGIs we get a magnificent show of deepest (in all meanings of this term) secrets of the oceans and we meet some absolutely fascinating creatures, including the giant oarfish (Regalecus glesne) and especially the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), the largest invertebrate known actually to the science...

This film was made by Impossible Pictures, the same company which produced the amazing ""Walking with dinosaurs"" series and their sequels - and here they did again an amazing job. Images are of course splendid, but also the scenario is great.

I learned A LOT from this film and I really didn't see those two hours passing by. I am so keeping my DVD! A RECOMMENDED VIEWING. ENJOY!",1421366400,,1535,4.6531365313653135
