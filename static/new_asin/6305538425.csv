1061996,3,6305538425,"This review is for ""The Beach Girls"" only:

The early 80's was a golden age for the teen sex comedy. It was a veritable cottage industry. Some were cute and clever, others were bland and boring. ""The Beach Girls"" falls somewhere in-between.

The plot revolves around three girls, who've just gotten out of school for the summer. Two of the girls are world-wise party-goers who attempt to loosen up their naive, virginal friend, as they stay at her uncle's beach house. It's non-stop partying, from picking up a middle-aged hitchhiker, to booze and drug fueled nights, the girls are gonna have fun! But what happens when the uncle finally shows up? Oh, the suspense is killing me!

Well, no, not really. Most of this stuff is by-the-numbers sex comedy formula. The jokes, the puns, the gags, are all pretty much the standard fare you'd expect. Debra Blee (who plays the virginal Sarah) is, oddly enough, more attractive than her two wild child friends (played by Val Kline and Jeana Keough), which was a nice little change from how most films like this go. But the hitchhiker who becomes Sarah's love interest (played by James Daughton), who is supposed to be a hip and laid back young musician-type, just looks too old to play this role. It's one of the ways the film misfires and takes you out of the moment. The scene where a young cop shows up during the party and almost immediately gets sucked into the shenanigans is another example of that. It just comes off as silly and forced, taking you out of the story, which might be the point, but the tongue-in-cheek humor just isn't delivered convincingly enough for you not to notice it. And the whole sub-plot, involving the drug smugglers and Coast Guard just feels completely out of place. And lastly, Sarah's transformation from ""upright do-right,"" to femme fatale, happens so fast, you might get whiplash as you watch it.

That isn't to say the film doesn't have some good points. The film has a nice bit of skin on display, so flesh fiends will get what they crave. The debauchery is certainly wild and crazy throughout the film, with a few raunchy scenes to spice things up more. The Coast Guard's raid near the film's end, as they go through the house to uncover where all the drugs have been hidden, is chuckle-worthy. And there is some great comic relief with the gardener (played by Bert Rosario) throughout the film and it gets especially good when he gets teamed up with the limo driver (played by George Cheung). Their antics in a fight sequences are actually pretty funny.

In the final analysis, ""The Beach Girls"" is a mediocre effort, that never tries to play up that it is anything more than a teen sex comedy. It's lack of pretentiousness about itself gives it a certain amount charm. But it is very repetitive and the jokes and gags wear a little thin by the end. The misfires grow as the film goes on, but it never takes anything too seriously. And that might be why it isn't more enjoyable. It's a fluffy and light-hearted 80's romp, to be sure, and fans of cult classic 80's cheese might enjoy this, but it isn't one that will stick with you after you've viewed it. Just like footprints in the sand, the film's impression is not one that will last for long. Much like how summer never does!",1377820800,,3264,4.611015490533563

Coach focuses on a former Olympic athlete now coaching a boys high school basketball team much to the chagrin of the head honcho at the high school.

There isn't much of a story in the Beach Girls, but I enjoyed watching Debra Blee as Sarah and Bert Rosario was awesome as the gardener.",1364515200,,368,4.397058823529412
1061998,4,6305538425,"I like both these movies a lot and I'm happy to have them in my collection. The Beach girls is a great low budget drive in type movie from the early 80's, lots of partying and juvenile humor and babes of course, really entertaining fun lite retro fare. Coach is more dramatic, but it's actually a scene for scene twin of Wildcats with Goldie Hawn, I think whoever made or wrote Wildcats owes these people some money, it's entertaining and a good flick and a groovy 1978 retro time capsule. Both these movies have a good deal of nostalgia and replay value for me, and the prints are very good.",1358899200,3,592,4.390909090909091

Because of its laid back approach (marijuana is smoked parents) and generally politically incorrect message in most ways it is very underrated by the establishment and so called alternative media. It is actually an excellent film.",1338336000,,604,4.98019801980198

I was very fond of Jeana Tomasina in those days, so I've seen the film a few times. For all you pop culture fans she was the wavey haired brunette in the ZZTop videos that had the 3 girls running around in the Hot Rod helping young people hook up.

1062054,4,6305538425,"More drive-in/grindhouse-style fun!  A grindhouse, by the way, was one of those 70's & 80's-era theaters that usually showed the same kind of sexy, violent exploitation fare as your typical drive-in theater.  Sadly, both grindhouses and drive-ins have mostly fallen by the wayside in our slick multiplex culture.  But, fear not, you get a sharp taste of that bygone era with these terrific ""Welcome to the Grindhouse"" DVDs.  So, what's in store when you pop this particular double-feature disc into your DVD player and kick back?  Glad you asked.

First (well, after the cheesy, scratchy, yet colorfully hypnotic ""previews of coming attractions"" bumper that every theater seemed to show in those days), you get a short trailer to something called ""The Van"" (randy guys cruising for chicks in their specially-outfitted-for-love vehicle) and a longer trailer for something called ""Jocks"" (randy guys on some vague high school or college sports team who party and chase girls a lot).  Do you sense a theme here?

Next up, our first feature, ""The Beach Girls"".  In a nutshell: one long party, frequent nudity (skinnydipping in the pool, skinnydipping on the beach, and just an overall casual attitude about the importance of clothing in general), and lots of pot smoking.  With its lenient attitude about drug use and sex, along with the way it ridicules men in uniform (especially the poor U.S. Coast Guard, whose officers are portrayed as ascot-wearing dopes), I can't imagine that ""The Beach Girls"" was very popular with PTA groups, law enforcement, and other organizations that usually sport a sour attitude about those kinds of things.  But you're not among those groups, are you, so all you need to know is this: the girls are sexy; the jokes are stupid but undeniably chuckle-inducing; and there's a general, upbeat ""sun & fun"" flavor that keeps things bopping along.  The result: 90 minutes of silly, clothing-optional fun.

Next up: more sexy previews.  ""Malibu Beach"" looks like the official sister film to ""The Beach Girls"".  In fact, many of the visual gags performed by the extras in ""The Beach Girls"" (dog stealing the bikini top from the gal sunbather, for example) are seen again- the exact same footage, I mean- in the trailer for ""Malibu Beach"".  I guess Crown International Pictures was an economical operation.  There's also a trailer to a film called ""My Tutor"", featuring that classic theme of the exploitation era, the student/teacher liaison (more on this later).  Oh, and be sure to remember: in order to see all these high-art previews and trailers, you need to hit the ""grindhouse experience"" icon on the DVD's menu screen, not just select an individual movie.  The ""grindhouse experience"" means you get all the goodies discussed here.

Next we have our second feature, entitled ""Coach"".  Of the handful of ""Welcome to the Grindhouse"" movies I've seen so far, this one is the most like, well... a real movie.  It's a nice little story about a female high school basketball coach winning over her detractors (the high school's old boy network, the skeptical team members, etc.) and eventually making her underachieving team into winners.  It's nothing groundbreaking, but this polished movie, with its recognizable actors (Cathy Lee Crosby, Keenan Wynn, etc.) was clearly an attempt by Crown International Pictures to break into more mainstream markets.  Fear not, though, exploitation fans... in many respects, Crown still couldn't help being Crown, so you still get the following from ""Coach"": occasional female toplessness (by the girl students, but not, alas, by Ms. Crosby... except for one short, teasing shot); lots of male butt views in the team shower for gal viewers; a hot affair (unfortunately, discreetly filmed) between Cathy Lee Crosby's coach character and one of her teenage charges (a very young Michael Biehn, who went on to play the time-traveling Reese a few years later in the first ""Terminator"" film); a surprisingly benign view of that teacher/student liaison on the part of the film makers (no 11th hour punishment or tragedy to break up the illicit lovers); and the usual goofy but fun jokes.

The prints used for the two films are both very, very good.  They're sharp, clear, and bright, and free of scratches and other glitches.  That, coupled with the fact that the films themselves rate a couple of notches higher on the production quality scale (especially ""Coach""), made these goofy, sexy comedy/dramas (well, ""dramas"" might be too strong a word) a pleasure to watch.  After all, there's nothing wrong with a little polish and professionalism with one's exploitation fare.

Well, enough with the sun, fun, and bikinis.  Now it's time for me to check out some of those ""Welcome to the Grindhouse"" DVDs that feature martial arts double features.  Everything can't be about girls and hedonism, you know.",1197504000,16,4854,5.0832282471626735
1062055,3,6305538425,"Before buying this video combo package I tried in vain just to get the Beach Girls by it'self but could not.  As always, I read reviews of products when possible and found after buying this product that it is indeed true what many other reviewers have said.  Pom Pom Girls is a total waste of a movie.

  I personally sat down to give it a chance just in case bias was involved but was quickly bored by the SLOW moving story, plot and everything else.

  Beach Girls on the other hand was and is still the '80 fun filled teenage romp movie that it was intended to be.  Sure there's alot of stuff that would never happen in real life but who cares.  It's a fun movie with a quick up beat to it.

  If you get this DVD, be sure to watch the Beach Girls and if you run out of coasters at a party be sure to put Pom Pom Girls side up to compensate.",1171238400,5,844,3.9820359281437128

The ""Beach Girls"" is a bit of a rip-off of ""Malibu Beach""  The bikini-top stealing dog scenes were pulled directly from that movie.  ""The Pom Pom Girls"" has a fun plot and is totally '70s.  The hair, fashions, and don't forget making out in a van!  Robert Carradine did a great job in this movie.  The plot consists of him and his buddy having fun for the summer, and meeting up with 2 foxy women along the way.  ""The Beach Girls"" is awful by comparison.  The storyline is boring, and the movie plods along.  It was trying to be a '70s movie, but things had changed by the '80s.  For the DVD, I am not a big fan of double-sided discs.  They tend to experience DVD rot over time.  This happens because the glue bonding the 2 sides breaks down.  It would have been better to just offer 2 single discs.
