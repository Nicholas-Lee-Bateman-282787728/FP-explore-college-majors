8236401,5,B000ZVQDOQ,Step aerobics is my favorite exercise routine and I loved this dvd. I not only got a great workout the time flew by. The instructor was great! I would love to take her classes. There is plenty of room to modify up or down - you can't beat that.,1305849600,,244,4.0
8236402,5,B000ZVQDOQ,"Using nothing but small hand weights and a small mat for the floor work, the intensity of the workout depends entirely on the energy you put into it.  If it's a good day, increase the weights, make the movements bigger, jump higher; if it's not, you can tone it down and still feel you've gotten some exercise for the day.  When you really move, you can really sweat.  It's a surprisingly good workout, and because the moves literally change every 60 seconds, it's almost impossible to get bored.  I look forward to more releases from Anni Mairs.",1237075200,2,546,4.597938144329897
