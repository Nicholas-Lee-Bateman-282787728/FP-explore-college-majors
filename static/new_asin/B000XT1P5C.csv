3006241,5,B000XT1P5C,"I am not disappointed by any of these movies, coming from a time when movies were great and not filled with the rubbish of today. They are ideal for older children and they are full of clean fun. All the characters in each movie are great and they play their parts superbly. In each movie Tammy acts ""dumb"" having come from a shanty boat background. Some things that others say she takes out of context and the funny things she will say because she does not understand always what they mean. For example when Tammy touches a doctor who is robed in the operating theatre, he does not like it as he is no longer sterile. When it is explained to her what she did wrong, she thinks there is another meaning to his sterility. I can watch these movies again and again and still love them. I really do recommend it to anyone who loves a really clean and fun movie.",1204070400,,857,4.296296296296297

3006243,5,B000XT1P5C,"I remember watching these films as a child during late night Friday evening viewings on the late show.  I was thoroughly captivated by the production in each one, each distinctive in its own way.  The First, Tammy and the Bachelor, has beautiful Debbie Reynolds singing her signature song and those who find sugary, sweet, sentimental offerings as artificial and boring are to be forewarned here.  But herein lies the three film's appeal. They are pure delight and pure escapism, something muchly needed in this world of moral decadence today.  In the second and third offering we have Sandra Dee as Tammy who is more than capable of holding her own and matches Reynolds in every way....maybe even more so considering that Dee's own personal life was a life of sadness and turmoil.  The backwood philosophies held to in the scripts here are certainly inspiring and noteworthy and something we could all learn from.  Reynolds and Dee are charming.  Leslie Nielsen is o.k. Gavin is his usual gorgeous self but bland and Peter Fonda, well, let's just excuse him and say that Dee makes him look good.  A set worth every penny and I'm so happy they're out for everyone to enjoy.  My personal favorite is ""Tammy and the Doctor"".  The scene where Tammy lets the nurses who have been laughing at her have it is worth a mint!!  Dee was a much better actress than anyone gave her credit for.  No wonder she was such a teen idol for boys back then!!  Who wouldn't have someone like Tammy Tyree in their life!!  THe movies themselves are great fun and better than all the garbage Hollywood turns out today.",1203811200,6,1594,4.68705035971223
3006244,4,B000XT1P5C,"This has been a great year for Ross Hunter on DVD. In addition to the Lana Turner melodrama double feature, Universal now gives us three comedies for a low price in this set. All three ""Tammy"" films made from 1957-63 are included. If you are looking for some family entertainment or an evening of nostalgia, this set is for you.

Taken chronologically, the first film ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" was released in 1957. Producer Hunter borrowed Debbie Reynolds, who was under contract to MGM, to play Tammy Tyree (short for Tambey which means immortal). This was a big A-budget film in Technicolor and CinemaScope. I am sure he knew that if he didn't have a ""Tammy"", he didn't have a movie.

Reynolds is a delight as the truth-telling, blunt river girl who finds herself sharing lodgings with the Brent family. Leslie Nielson is the very handsome pilot who crashes a plane in a swamp and is rescued by Tammy and her grandfather (Walter Brennan). A lot of viewers seem to remember that the Brents were rich, but they actually didn't have much money. Son Peter (the ""Bachelor"" of the title) was trying to find a way to make the land pay for itself. The only income the family had was from the tourist trade who visited their mansion each year. When Grandpa is thrown in jail by the revenuers, Tammy hitchhikes with her goat Nanny to BrentWood.

Most of the story is taken up with fish out of water scenes, but this is the type of comedy that Reynolds excels in. The supporting cast is excellent, with fine turns by Fay Wray, Mildred Natwick, Sidney Blackmer, Phil Ober, and Mala Powers.

Reynolds especially impresses in a sincere scene at the tourist gathering where she ""improvises"" a story about the dress she is wearing and her arrival at the house in the previous century. The viewer really can't help but be charmed by her. She also sings the title song which became a big record hit for her. In fact, the film was doing only ordinary business until Reynolds recording began to get a lot of radio play. Universal-International put it back into several hundred theaters and drive-ins and made a LOT of money.

""Tammy and the Bachelor"" on DVD in widescreen has great color. Directed by Joseph Pevney with some nice on location photography, it clocks in at a brisk 89 minutes. The disk it is on includes the original trailer and English SDH and French subtitles. Audiences loved this movie and continue to do so. First week sales of the DVD in stores and online was fantastic.

The second and third films in the series are one disk. ""Tammy Tell Me True"" was released in 1961 and starred Ross Hunter discovery Sandra Dee as Tammy. Dee was certainly not the actress that Reynolds was, but she does bring a lovely charm to the role. The script was by Oscar Brodney (who wrote all of the films), and it was directed by Harry Keller. It was released in a different widescreen process and you will get bigger image on your screen with both the movies on this disk. Both films also have the SDH and French subtitle options.

Taking up where ""Bachelor"" left off, Tammy is with the Brents. Pete has gone off the agriculture college, and Tammy is left waiting at Brentwood. With typical Tyree pluck, she decides she needs to get some education and takes the Effie B shanty boat down the Mississippi River to attend Seminola College as a ""special student.""

The Dean of Women, Miss Jenks (played by Virginia Grey, a friend of producer Hunter) recognizes Tammy's innate humanity and welcomes her to sit in on classes in current events and public speaking. The latter is taught by instructor Tom Freeman. He and Tammy met earlier in the day by a tree in the park.

Tammy is also sent to be a companion to Mrs. Annie Call (Beulah Bondi). Mrs. Call is a bitter, mean old woman - as she says herself. Her niece misunderstands Tammy's background and sends her away. When Tammy sneaks back into the backyard and has a heart to heart talk with her, Mrs. Call hatches a plan. She runs away to the Effie B to relive her childhood times of life on the river.

There are complications. Tammy isn't accepted by the others in school, she gets a couple of babysitting jobs, and she is even eventually accused of kidnapping and robbery. Don't worry it all works out in the end.

The supporting cast here is just as interesting as in the previous film. In addition to Grey and Bondi, we have Gigi Perreau (former child star), Taffy Paul (who would become Stephanie Powers), Charles Drake, Hayden Rorke, Billy Mumy, Edgar Buchanan, and Juanita Moore. We also see some familiar exteriors on the Universal backlot including the house that would belong to the Munsters and the exterior of the house that the Kettles won and lived in for several entries in that movie series.

Dee isn't quite as lucky in the leading man department here. She is stuck with John Gavin, who is more handsome than Leslie Nielson to be sure, but just can't act. The scene where he is to laugh at things Tammy says is so forced, it is embarrassing to watch. He does say the same line that Nielson says to Reynolds: ""If I'm laughing at you, it's with pure delight."" And that isn't said with much conviction either.

No trailer is included with ""Tammy Tell Me True"", but it does have the lovely original score by Percy Faith, one of his few original film scores. There is a title song that serves the purpose, but the original by Ray Livingston and Jay Evans is missed. There is no other credit for the slight singing performance, so until otherwise informed, we have to assume the Dee did her own singing here. This film is the longest of the trio at 97 minutes and is directed by Harry Keller.

The final theatrical feature here is ""Tammy and the Doctor"" released in 1963 At least we get a trailer with this film, though it certainly isn't in very good shape.

Dee suffers from a poor choice of leading man here, too. One would think that Peter Fonda would be able to express some kind of emotion or at least some charisma on the screen. Here in his debut, he is a zero. His delivery of the line ""If I'm laughing, it's with pure delight"" is even worse than Gavin's. And Dee is getting a bit old to play the innocent wide eyed Tammy. Producer Hunter must have decided that they had to get Tammy out of the back woods and off the river. So with Bondi recreating her Mrs. Call role and needing heart surgery, she and Tammy are uprooted and transferred to Los Angeles.

As quickly as she was taken into college, Tammy is employed by the hospital. She creates several funny incidents, but she is always put back to mopping floors (this gag wears out its welcome after the fourth time). She becomes enamored of a young intern (Fonda) and decides she doesn't love Tom Warren (Gavin) after all and sets her cap for young Dr. Mark Cheswick. Tammy is nothing if not fickle.

The supporting cast again is excellent with MacDonald Carey (homely as he is), Margaret Lindsey, Alice Pearce (the original ""Bewtiched"" Gladys Kravitz), Reginald Owen, and Adam West (just before becoming Batman on television). The real treat for trivia and movie fans in the cast is Joan Marshall. Who?? Well as Joan Arless she played the double male/female leading role in ""Homicidal."" Here she is a lovely tall redhead, and it's fun to see her as she really looks. Marshall was also originally cast as Lily Munster, but was replaced by Yvonne DeCarlo for the subsequent series.

Dee sings the original title tune, although I am not sure that is truly her voice. ""Tammy and the Doctor"" has the happy ending you expect. And it is fun. It runs 88 minutes and Keller once again takes the helm.

Of the three films,this is the only one with a singular credit by writer Brodney. The others credit the original novels by Cid Rickets Sumner (Tammy Out of Time and Tammy Tell Me True.) Sumner's story did not have a Tammy ending, she was murdered by her grandson.

All of the movies in this collection are enjoyable, if you are in the right mood, or if you just like the stars. Certainly you can see the progression from original project, to star vehicle, to assembly line feature making as you go along. It's a good history lesson in how Universal Studios was run and the product it was turning out. The only ""Tammy"" title missing is ""Tammy and the Millionaire"" which was actually a few episodes of a short-lived television series starring Debbie Watson edited together to make a poor feature film.

At the low suggested retail price, you get a lot of entertainment value. And you just might laugh a time or two. Tambey - it means ""immortal"" you know!",1203120000,51,8551,4.561277705345502
3006245,5,B000XT1P5C,"It's finally here!!!  I was so excited when I came across this movie collection.  I love these movies and have tried to find it everywhere and all I could find were used VHS copies.  So, when I found this one, I didn't even wait a day to buy it.  All of these movies are great.  In the first movie, Debbie Reynolds does an amazing job as Tammy Tyree.  In the second and third movies, Sandra Dee takes over the role of Tammy and it works perfectly.  Quite often, when a main character is switched, you can spend the entire movie omparing the two different actresses.  This is not the fact with these movies.  Both actresses did a terrific job bringing the character to life.  These movies are a terrific addition to any movie collection and perfect for the whole family.",1202256000,31,769,4.428571428571429
3006246,4,B000XT1P5C,"Its about time, these are coming to dvd.  These movies are wonderful. Something the whole family can enjoy. Its a good deal for all three moives.",1194739200,13,145,4.576923076923077
3006247,5,B000XT1P5C,"""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is the best of the ""Tammy"" series, with wonderful and very entertaining performances by its stellar cast, including the energetic Debbie Reynolds, who not only entertains the viewer with her role as the backwoods Tammy Tyree, but also actually becomes her! Debbie Reynolds also had notable success with the movie's theme song, ""Tammy"" (better known as ""Tammy's in Love)."" One of the most memorable scenes to me is of Tammy performing as a Southern lady tour guide and gives a wonderful and sentimental performance that you won't forget! Also notable is Fay Wray as Pete's mother, Mrs. Brent and Mildred Natwick as the eccentric Aunt Renie, artist and cat lover extrodinaire! ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is followed by three sequels, with Sandra Dee taking on the part of Tammy Tyree in ""Tammy, Tell Me True"" and ""Tammy and the Doctor,"" and then Debbie Watson as Tammy Tarleton in 1967's ""Tammy and the Millionaire,"" which is sadly missing from this set. Though all three movies included her in this set are enjoyable and entertaining in their own way,  ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is a true classic movie gem and should not be missed! The three ""Tammy"" movies collected here are a welcome addition to any classic movie dvd library and will add a nice touch of '50's innocent whimsy to your classic romantic comedy dvd collection! It's great to finally see these wonderful titles getting the dvd treatment!

""Tammy and the Bachelor"" (1957)
Sentimental and sugary late `50's comedy with wonderful performances throughout, ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is one of those movies that you simply cannot help but enjoy watching again and again! The plot involves a handsome, young man who has just crashed his plane in some backwoods swamp.  The man is then rescued by young and pretty Tammy Tyree (Debbie Reynolds, who gives a heartfelt performance) who lives with her lay-preacher-cum-moonshiner grandfather (wonderfully performed by Walter Brennan) in a houseboat next to the riverbank. The young man introduces himself as Peter Brent (Leslie Nielsen), and is charmed by the sweet spirited Tammy.  Before Peter leaves, he tells Grandpa that if he ever needs any help, to come find him.  It isn't long until Grandpa is sent to jail for his moonshining, so he sends Tammy to stay with Pete. Tammy discovers that Peter Brent is not only a handsome bachelor, but is also very wealthy! Pete, as well as his entire family, get caught up in Tammy's home cooking, enthusiasm and quaint sunshiny personality which brings about changes in Pete's family and in Pete himself!

""Tammy, Tell Me True"" (1961)
Following the success ""Tammy and the Bachelor,"" Sandra Dee takes on the part of the backwoods, riverboat gal, Tammy Tyree.  In search of an education to better herself, Tammy is off to college and is soon caught up in the lives of the college staff, especially young and handsome college professor, Tom Freeman (John Gavin). A fun and energetic romantic comedy that is both entertaining in it's simple story telling and the comedic situations.  Tammy tries her hand at babysitting some unruly kids whose parents refrain from disciplining them.  And the outcome is hilarious! I also enjoyed the wonderful scenes with Tammy becoming a paid companion to a wealthy widower, Mrs. Annie Call (Beulah Bondi, who gives a great performance) and discovers a kindred spirit in the seemingly bitter old lady.  ""Tammy, Tell Me True"" is entertaining in its storytelling and the cast gives spirited performances.  Sandra Dee's take on the ""Tammy"" role is inspiring and she is (as always) sweet and lovable to watch.  A fun and enjoyable addition to ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" that you'll enjoy watching again and again!

""Tammy and the Doctor"" (1963)
Sandra Dee reprises her role as the down to earth Tammy Tyree in this third installment of the ""Tammy"" series.  Though entertaining in its overall storytelling, ""Tammy and the Doctor"" seems more corny than sincere in the cast performances this time out. The plot consists of Tammy becoming a candy striper at an area hospital, where she meets young and handsome Dr Mark Cheswick (Peter Fonda). The nurses have a laugh at Tammy's backwoods philosophies and once again, Tammy has to set things straight in each of their lives. An enjoyable cast includes Macdonald Carey as Dr. Wayne Bentley and Beulah Bondi reprises her role as Mrs. Annie Call. Though not up to par as it's predecessors, ""Tammy and the Doctor"" is enjoyable enough for an occasional night of TV viewing.",1194566400,101,4505,4.965471447543161

3006935,4,B000XT1P5C,"Prepare yourself for barrels of laughs. Tammy is a naive bayou girl who's never been to the real world in all her seventeen years of life. The three movies tell of her journey through knowledge. The only disappointment is the fact that they changed the girl who plays Tammy. Debbie Reynolds makes a perfect Tammy in the first film. Although Sandra Dee is a wonderful actress, she detracts from who Tammy is in the second and third films. Also, the second and third films aren't as well done as the first. Still, all three make a good set for laughs.",1420243200,,549,4.5

3006986,5,B000XT1P5C,"The only extras are --I think the trailers. I lived the movies so much, and it made me happy to see them again. My personal favorite is Tammy Tell Me True, because I loved the story the best -- Tammy not putting up with Pete ignoring her, so becomes proactive and goes to college. I agree that Debbie Reynolds is the better actress, but apparently ""could not"" do the second movie (she had two other movies in 1961, that may have been why. The Pleasure of His Company (1961); The Second Time Around (1961) )

But the films themselves made me happy back the first time, and every time. They are sweet, and the song Tammy is wonderful. Many say they didn't like the song for Tammy Tell Me True --but it was appropriate that a new song be used, for commercial reasons, and for plot reasons (Tammy was questioning whether she is in love again, or not, and if her last love was the real one, or is this?). Of course ""Tammy's in Love"" has a better tune and melody. Big deal, the other is OK.",1403222400,,984,4.262032085561497

3007147,5,B000XT1P5C,"I'm only the latest to fall under the spell of this enchanting 1957 film. I vaguely remembered the TV show, and when I was a kid, the theme was one of my favorite songs. I thought it wouldn't be in this film, but it was (this is where it came from). I thought the movie would be a forgettable puppy love tale. Boy, was I powerful wrong. How amazing Doris Day was, even this young. How incredible the writing is in this movie, especially Tammy's lines of folk wisdom. And how great to see Walter Brennan as the grandpa. And yet another early appearance of Leslie Nielsen.

It's win-win-win, but I would go further. If everyone saw ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" it would be a better world. If today's writers and directors saw it, it might arrest the current downward spiral of movies and TV. Every now and then one watches an unknown movie that turns out to be a gem (a great many of them star Doris Day). This is one of those movies. Leonard Maltin gives it three stars, and now I see why. I'll eventually watch the other two included Tammy films with Sandra Dee, about which I cannot at this time write, but I'm glad to have seen, and won't quickly forget, ""Tammy and the Bachelor"".",1308873600,,1178,4.3545454545454545

Poor Tammy always falls for the wrong guy, is always dressed like a hicky girl or tries to look like a boy.  She keeps thinking she is falling in love but the person she sees as her match is not the one in love with her as a result a series of amusing misunderstandings take place until it sorts itself out and she gets the right man.

Both Debbie Reynolds and Sandra Dee do an excellent job portraying the naive Tammy, with her ""backwoods"" quirks, charming insights and colorful language.  These movies are not cinematic masterpieces, but they are perfect for an afternoon or evening of light entertainment and reminiscing about a simpler and gentler era.

3007220,5,B000XT1P5C,"What a delight it is to see the Debbie Reynolds charmer TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR finally on DVD, packaged with the two sequels starring Sandra Dee (TAMMY TELL ME TRUE and TAMMY AND THE DOCTOR).

While Sandra Dee made the character of Tammy one of her most fondly-remembered, it's Debbie Reynolds who truly owns the role.  In the classic original TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR (filmed in 1957 and based on the book by Mrs Cid Ricketts Sumner), we first meet Tambrey ""Tammy"" Tyree, the backwoods girl who falls in love with handsome Peter Brent (Leslie Nielsen) after his plane crashes near her home.  When her grandfather is arrested for bootlegging, cow-eyed Tammy follows Peter back to his family estate, where her rustic, homespun values get her into a mess of trouble.  The movie is best-known for it's Academy Award-nominated song (""Tammy"") written by Jay Livingston, sung over the main titles by the Ames Brothers, and later reprised in the film itself by Debbie Reynolds.  The cast also boasts Mildred Natwick, Fay Wray, Walter Brennan and Mala Powers.

TAMMY TELL ME TRUE was released a few years later in 1961.  With Debbie Reynolds unable to reprise the role, Universal contract starlet Sandra Dee took over for the continuing adventures of Tammy.  Wanting to experience a proper education, Tammy takes her houseboat down the river and enrols at Seminola College.  There, she warms the heart of crusty widow Mrs Annie Call (Beulah Bondi) and falls head over heels for teacher Mr Freeman (John Gavin).  Look closely for Dee's ""Imitation of Life"" costar Juanita Moore; plus Julia Meade and Virginia Grey.

Finally in TAMMY AND THE DOCTOR (1963), Sandra Dee returns as Tammy, with her object of affection (the doctor of the title) played by an up-and-coming Peter Fonda.  When Mrs Call becomes seriously ill, Tammy accompanies her interstate to a large Los Angeles hospital.  As per usual, Tammy's plain-speaking ways get her into all sorts of strife; as she finds herself falling for handsome intern Mark Cheswick (Peter Fonda).  A dubbed Sandra Dee also gets to recreate the original ""Tammy"" title song in this movie.  Co-starring Macdonald Carey, Margaret Lindsay, Reginald Owen and Alice Pearce.

This is a top value DVD collection.  TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR is presented in it's original CinemaScope ratio with splendid colour.  The two sequels are located on the second disc (both discs are dual-layer format).  Extra features are limited to original trailers for ""Bachelor"" and ""Doctor"".",1205193600,14,2489,5.041564792176039

Some things that others say she takes out of context and the funny things she will say because she does not understand always what they mean. For example when Tammy touches a doctor who is robed in the operating theatre, he does not like it as he is no longer sterile. When it is explained to her what she did wrong, she thinks there is another meaning to his sterility. I can watch these movies again and again and still love them.

3240740,5,B000XT1P5C,"I remember watching these films as a child during late night Friday evening viewings on the late show.  I was thoroughly captivated by the production in each one, each distinctive in its own way.  The First, Tammy and the Bachelor, has beautiful Debbie Reynolds singing her signature song and those who find sugary, sweet, sentimental offerings as artificial and boring are to be forewarned here.  But herein lies the three film's appeal. They are pure delight and pure escapism, something muchly needed in this world of moral decadence today.  In the second and third offering we have Sandra Dee as Tammy who is more than capable of holding her own and matches Reynolds in every way....maybe even more so considering that Dee's own personal life was a life of sadness and turmoil.  The backwood philosophies held to in the scripts here are certainly inspiring and noteworthy and something we could all learn from.  Reynolds and Dee are charming.  Leslie Nielsen is o.k. Gavin is his usual gorgeous self but bland and Peter Fonda, well, let's just excuse him and say that Dee makes him look good.  A set worth every penny and I'm so happy they're out for everyone to enjoy.  My personal favorite is ""Tammy and the Doctor"".  The scene where Tammy lets the nurses who have been laughing at her have it is worth a mint!!  Dee was a much better actress than anyone gave her credit for.  No wonder she was such a teen idol for boys back then!!  Who wouldn't have someone like Tammy Tyree in their life!!  THe movies themselves are great fun and better than all the garbage Hollywood turns out today.",1203811200,6,1594,4.68705035971223
3240741,4,B000XT1P5C,"This has been a great year for Ross Hunter on DVD. In addition to the Lana Turner melodrama double feature, Universal now gives us three comedies for a low price in this set. All three ""Tammy"" films made from 1957-63 are included. If you are looking for some family entertainment or an evening of nostalgia, this set is for you.

Taken chronologically, the first film ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" was released in 1957. Producer Hunter borrowed Debbie Reynolds, who was under contract to MGM, to play Tammy Tyree (short for Tambey which means immortal). This was a big A-budget film in Technicolor and CinemaScope. I am sure he knew that if he didn't have a ""Tammy"", he didn't have a movie.

Reynolds is a delight as the truth-telling, blunt river girl who finds herself sharing lodgings with the Brent family. Leslie Nielson is the very handsome pilot who crashes a plane in a swamp and is rescued by Tammy and her grandfather (Walter Brennan). A lot of viewers seem to remember that the Brents were rich, but they actually didn't have much money. Son Peter (the ""Bachelor"" of the title) was trying to find a way to make the land pay for itself. The only income the family had was from the tourist trade who visited their mansion each year. When Grandpa is thrown in jail by the revenuers, Tammy hitchhikes with her goat Nanny to BrentWood.

Most of the story is taken up with fish out of water scenes, but this is the type of comedy that Reynolds excels in. The supporting cast is excellent, with fine turns by Fay Wray, Mildred Natwick, Sidney Blackmer, Phil Ober, and Mala Powers.

Reynolds especially impresses in a sincere scene at the tourist gathering where she ""improvises"" a story about the dress she is wearing and her arrival at the house in the previous century. The viewer really can't help but be charmed by her. She also sings the title song which became a big record hit for her. In fact, the film was doing only ordinary business until Reynolds recording began to get a lot of radio play. Universal-International put it back into several hundred theaters and drive-ins and made a LOT of money.

""Tammy and the Bachelor"" on DVD in widescreen has great color. Directed by Joseph Pevney with some nice on location photography, it clocks in at a brisk 89 minutes. The disk it is on includes the original trailer and English SDH and French subtitles. Audiences loved this movie and continue to do so. First week sales of the DVD in stores and online was fantastic.

The second and third films in the series are one disk. ""Tammy Tell Me True"" was released in 1961 and starred Ross Hunter discovery Sandra Dee as Tammy. Dee was certainly not the actress that Reynolds was, but she does bring a lovely charm to the role. The script was by Oscar Brodney (who wrote all of the films), and it was directed by Harry Keller. It was released in a different widescreen process and you will get bigger image on your screen with both the movies on this disk. Both films also have the SDH and French subtitle options.

Taking up where ""Bachelor"" left off, Tammy is with the Brents. Pete has gone off the agriculture college, and Tammy is left waiting at Brentwood. With typical Tyree pluck, she decides she needs to get some education and takes the Effie B shanty boat down the Mississippi River to attend Seminola College as a ""special student.""

The Dean of Women, Miss Jenks (played by Virginia Grey, a friend of producer Hunter) recognizes Tammy's innate humanity and welcomes her to sit in on classes in current events and public speaking. The latter is taught by instructor Tom Freeman. He and Tammy met earlier in the day by a tree in the park.

Tammy is also sent to be a companion to Mrs. Annie Call (Beulah Bondi). Mrs. Call is a bitter, mean old woman - as she says herself. Her niece misunderstands Tammy's background and sends her away. When Tammy sneaks back into the backyard and has a heart to heart talk with her, Mrs. Call hatches a plan. She runs away to the Effie B to relive her childhood times of life on the river.

There are complications. Tammy isn't accepted by the others in school, she gets a couple of babysitting jobs, and she is even eventually accused of kidnapping and robbery. Don't worry it all works out in the end.

The supporting cast here is just as interesting as in the previous film. In addition to Grey and Bondi, we have Gigi Perreau (former child star), Taffy Paul (who would become Stephanie Powers), Charles Drake, Hayden Rorke, Billy Mumy, Edgar Buchanan, and Juanita Moore. We also see some familiar exteriors on the Universal backlot including the house that would belong to the Munsters and the exterior of the house that the Kettles won and lived in for several entries in that movie series.

Dee isn't quite as lucky in the leading man department here. She is stuck with John Gavin, who is more handsome than Leslie Nielson to be sure, but just can't act. The scene where he is to laugh at things Tammy says is so forced, it is embarrassing to watch. He does say the same line that Nielson says to Reynolds: ""If I'm laughing at you, it's with pure delight."" And that isn't said with much conviction either.

No trailer is included with ""Tammy Tell Me True"", but it does have the lovely original score by Percy Faith, one of his few original film scores. There is a title song that serves the purpose, but the original by Ray Livingston and Jay Evans is missed. There is no other credit for the slight singing performance, so until otherwise informed, we have to assume the Dee did her own singing here. This film is the longest of the trio at 97 minutes and is directed by Harry Keller.

The final theatrical feature here is ""Tammy and the Doctor"" released in 1963 At least we get a trailer with this film, though it certainly isn't in very good shape.

Dee suffers from a poor choice of leading man here, too. One would think that Peter Fonda would be able to express some kind of emotion or at least some charisma on the screen. Here in his debut, he is a zero. His delivery of the line ""If I'm laughing, it's with pure delight"" is even worse than Gavin's. And Dee is getting a bit old to play the innocent wide eyed Tammy. Producer Hunter must have decided that they had to get Tammy out of the back woods and off the river. So with Bondi recreating her Mrs. Call role and needing heart surgery, she and Tammy are uprooted and transferred to Los Angeles.

As quickly as she was taken into college, Tammy is employed by the hospital. She creates several funny incidents, but she is always put back to mopping floors (this gag wears out its welcome after the fourth time). She becomes enamored of a young intern (Fonda) and decides she doesn't love Tom Warren (Gavin) after all and sets her cap for young Dr. Mark Cheswick. Tammy is nothing if not fickle.

The supporting cast again is excellent with MacDonald Carey (homely as he is), Margaret Lindsey, Alice Pearce (the original ""Bewtiched"" Gladys Kravitz), Reginald Owen, and Adam West (just before becoming Batman on television). The real treat for trivia and movie fans in the cast is Joan Marshall. Who?? Well as Joan Arless she played the double male/female leading role in ""Homicidal."" Here she is a lovely tall redhead, and it's fun to see her as she really looks. Marshall was also originally cast as Lily Munster, but was replaced by Yvonne DeCarlo for the subsequent series.

Dee sings the original title tune, although I am not sure that is truly her voice. ""Tammy and the Doctor"" has the happy ending you expect. And it is fun. It runs 88 minutes and Keller once again takes the helm.

Of the three films,this is the only one with a singular credit by writer Brodney. The others credit the original novels by Cid Rickets Sumner (Tammy Out of Time and Tammy Tell Me True.) Sumner's story did not have a Tammy ending, she was murdered by her grandson.

All of the movies in this collection are enjoyable, if you are in the right mood, or if you just like the stars. Certainly you can see the progression from original project, to star vehicle, to assembly line feature making as you go along. It's a good history lesson in how Universal Studios was run and the product it was turning out. The only ""Tammy"" title missing is ""Tammy and the Millionaire"" which was actually a few episodes of a short-lived television series starring Debbie Watson edited together to make a poor feature film.

At the low suggested retail price, you get a lot of entertainment value. And you just might laugh a time or two. Tambey - it means ""immortal"" you know!",1203120000,51,8551,4.561277705345502

I love these movies and have tried to find it everywhere and all I could find were used VHS copies.  So, when I found this one, I didn't even wait a day to buy it.  All of these movies are great.  In the first movie, Debbie Reynolds does an amazing job as Tammy Tyree.  In the second and third movies, Sandra Dee takes over the role of Tammy and it works perfectly.  Quite often, when a main character is switched, you can spend the entire movie omparing the two different actresses.  This is not the fact with these movies.  Both actresses did a terrific job bringing the character to life.  These movies are a terrific addition to any movie collection and perfect for the whole family.",1202256000,31,769,4.428571428571429

3240744,5,B000XT1P5C,"""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is the best of the ""Tammy"" series, with wonderful and very entertaining performances by its stellar cast, including the energetic Debbie Reynolds, who not only entertains the viewer with her role as the backwoods Tammy Tyree, but also actually becomes her! Debbie Reynolds also had notable success with the movie's theme song, ""Tammy"" (better known as ""Tammy's in Love)."" One of the most memorable scenes to me is of Tammy performing as a Southern lady tour guide and gives a wonderful and sentimental performance that you won't forget! Also notable is Fay Wray as Pete's mother, Mrs. Brent and Mildred Natwick as the eccentric Aunt Renie, artist and cat lover extrodinaire! ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is followed by three sequels, with Sandra Dee taking on the part of Tammy Tyree in ""Tammy, Tell Me True"" and ""Tammy and the Doctor,"" and then Debbie Watson as Tammy Tarleton in 1967's ""Tammy and the Millionaire,"" which is sadly missing from this set. Though all three movies included her in this set are enjoyable and entertaining in their own way,  ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is a true classic movie gem and should not be missed! The three ""Tammy"" movies collected here are a welcome addition to any classic movie dvd library and will add a nice touch of '50's innocent whimsy to your classic romantic comedy dvd collection! It's great to finally see these wonderful titles getting the dvd treatment!

""Tammy and the Bachelor"" (1957)
Sentimental and sugary late `50's comedy with wonderful performances throughout, ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" is one of those movies that you simply cannot help but enjoy watching again and again! The plot involves a handsome, young man who has just crashed his plane in some backwoods swamp.  The man is then rescued by young and pretty Tammy Tyree (Debbie Reynolds, who gives a heartfelt performance) who lives with her lay-preacher-cum-moonshiner grandfather (wonderfully performed by Walter Brennan) in a houseboat next to the riverbank. The young man introduces himself as Peter Brent (Leslie Nielsen), and is charmed by the sweet spirited Tammy.  Before Peter leaves, he tells Grandpa that if he ever needs any help, to come find him.  It isn't long until Grandpa is sent to jail for his moonshining, so he sends Tammy to stay with Pete. Tammy discovers that Peter Brent is not only a handsome bachelor, but is also very wealthy! Pete, as well as his entire family, get caught up in Tammy's home cooking, enthusiasm and quaint sunshiny personality which brings about changes in Pete's family and in Pete himself!

""Tammy, Tell Me True"" (1961)
Following the success ""Tammy and the Bachelor,"" Sandra Dee takes on the part of the backwoods, riverboat gal, Tammy Tyree.  In search of an education to better herself, Tammy is off to college and is soon caught up in the lives of the college staff, especially young and handsome college professor, Tom Freeman (John Gavin). A fun and energetic romantic comedy that is both entertaining in it's simple story telling and the comedic situations.  Tammy tries her hand at babysitting some unruly kids whose parents refrain from disciplining them.  And the outcome is hilarious! I also enjoyed the wonderful scenes with Tammy becoming a paid companion to a wealthy widower, Mrs. Annie Call (Beulah Bondi, who gives a great performance) and discovers a kindred spirit in the seemingly bitter old lady.  ""Tammy, Tell Me True"" is entertaining in its storytelling and the cast gives spirited performances.  Sandra Dee's take on the ""Tammy"" role is inspiring and she is (as always) sweet and lovable to watch.  A fun and enjoyable addition to ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" that you'll enjoy watching again and again!

""Tammy and the Doctor"" (1963)
Sandra Dee reprises her role as the down to earth Tammy Tyree in this third installment of the ""Tammy"" series.  Though entertaining in its overall storytelling, ""Tammy and the Doctor"" seems more corny than sincere in the cast performances this time out. The plot consists of Tammy becoming a candy striper at an area hospital, where she meets young and handsome Dr Mark Cheswick (Peter Fonda). The nurses have a laugh at Tammy's backwoods philosophies and once again, Tammy has to set things straight in each of their lives. An enjoyable cast includes Macdonald Carey as Dr. Wayne Bentley and Beulah Bondi reprises her role as Mrs. Annie Call. Though not up to par as it's predecessors, ""Tammy and the Doctor"" is enjoyable enough for an occasional night of TV viewing.",1194566400,101,4505,4.965471447543161

I saw this film at the movies when it first came out and was my favorite of your films, I ate at the Paddle wheel that you owned just before they closed it down had the best steak I have ever eaten. We Mom & Dad & myself we saw you at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Vegas back in the nineties and you looked so beautiful & made us all laugh.
God Bless you Debbie Reynolds You have been such an inspiration for so many of us. Your film Tammy & the Bachelor just radiates the genius of your acting skills. I was blown away by this film. You gave us so much in your films and entertained so many of us.
You will be greatly missed, but you will always live in the hearts of so many of us.
Thank you for all you gave us.",1482969600,7,735,3.8421052631578947

She is ignorant of the outside world but far able to cope with it's pretentiousness far better than her modern counterparts can cope with her.

The three movies tell of her journey through knowledge. The only disappointment is the fact that they changed the girl who plays Tammy. Debbie Reynolds makes a perfect Tammy in the first film. Although Sandra Dee is a wonderful actress, she detracts from who Tammy is in the second and third films. Also, the second and third films aren't as well done as the first.

My personal favorite is Tammy Tell Me True, because I loved the story the best -- Tammy not putting up with Pete ignoring her, so becomes proactive and goes to college. I agree that Debbie Reynolds is the better actress, but apparently ""could not"" do the second movie (she had two other movies in 1961, that may have been why. The Pleasure of His Company (1961); The Second Time Around (1961) )

But the films themselves made me happy back the first time, and every time. They are sweet, and the song Tammy is wonderful. Many say they didn't like the song for Tammy Tell Me True --but it was appropriate that a new song be used, for commercial reasons, and for plot reasons (Tammy was questioning whether she is in love again, or not, and if her last love was the real one, or is this?). Of course ""Tammy's in Love"" has a better tune and melody. Big deal, the other is OK.",1403222400,,984,4.262032085561497

I thought it wouldn't be in this film, but it was (this is where it came from). I thought the movie would be a forgettable puppy love tale. Boy, was I powerful wrong. How amazing Doris Day was, even this young. How incredible the writing is in this movie, especially Tammy's lines of folk wisdom. And how great to see Walter Brennan as the grandpa. And yet another early appearance of Leslie Nielsen.

It's win-win-win, but I would go further. If everyone saw ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" it would be a better world. If today's writers and directors saw it, it might arrest the current downward spiral of movies and TV. Every now and then one watches an unknown movie that turns out to be a gem (a great many of them star Doris Day). This is one of those movies. Leonard Maltin gives it three stars, and now I see why. I'll eventually watch the other two included Tammy films with Sandra Dee, about which I cannot at this time write, but I'm glad to have seen, and won't quickly forget, ""Tammy and the Bachelor"".",1308873600,,1178,4.3545454545454545

Now we finally get her performance in Tammy and the Bachelor as the first of a set of three Tammy movies, in two of which Sandra Dee is cast as Tammy.

3241717,5,B000XT1P5C,"What a delight it is to see the Debbie Reynolds charmer TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR finally on DVD, packaged with the two sequels starring Sandra Dee (TAMMY TELL ME TRUE and TAMMY AND THE DOCTOR).

While Sandra Dee made the character of Tammy one of her most fondly-remembered, it's Debbie Reynolds who truly owns the role.  In the classic original TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR (filmed in 1957 and based on the book by Mrs Cid Ricketts Sumner), we first meet Tambrey ""Tammy"" Tyree, the backwoods girl who falls in love with handsome Peter Brent (Leslie Nielsen) after his plane crashes near her home.  When her grandfather is arrested for bootlegging, cow-eyed Tammy follows Peter back to his family estate, where her rustic, homespun values get her into a mess of trouble.  The movie is best-known for it's Academy Award-nominated song (""Tammy"") written by Jay Livingston, sung over the main titles by the Ames Brothers, and later reprised in the film itself by Debbie Reynolds.  The cast also boasts Mildred Natwick, Fay Wray, Walter Brennan and Mala Powers.

TAMMY TELL ME TRUE was released a few years later in 1961.  With Debbie Reynolds unable to reprise the role, Universal contract starlet Sandra Dee took over for the continuing adventures of Tammy.  Wanting to experience a proper education, Tammy takes her houseboat down the river and enrols at Seminola College.  There, she warms the heart of crusty widow Mrs Annie Call (Beulah Bondi) and falls head over heels for teacher Mr Freeman (John Gavin).  Look closely for Dee's ""Imitation of Life"" costar Juanita Moore; plus Julia Meade and Virginia Grey.

Finally in TAMMY AND THE DOCTOR (1963), Sandra Dee returns as Tammy, with her object of affection (the doctor of the title) played by an up-and-coming Peter Fonda.  When Mrs Call becomes seriously ill, Tammy accompanies her interstate to a large Los Angeles hospital.  As per usual, Tammy's plain-speaking ways get her into all sorts of strife; as she finds herself falling for handsome intern Mark Cheswick (Peter Fonda).  A dubbed Sandra Dee also gets to recreate the original ""Tammy"" title song in this movie.  Co-starring Macdonald Carey, Margaret Lindsay, Reginald Owen and Alice Pearce.

This is a top value DVD collection.  TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR is presented in it's original CinemaScope ratio with splendid colour.  The two sequels are located on the second disc (both discs are dual-layer format).  Extra features are limited to original trailers for ""Bachelor"" and ""Doctor"".",1205193600,14,2489,5.041564792176039

8229602,2,B000XT1P5C,"When I opened the package, instead of three movies, there were only two.  Tammy and the Bachelor and Tammy Tell Me True were in the sealed package, but Tammy and the Doctor was not.  The packaging doesn't really have a place for a third disc to be inserted.  I want the third movie sent to me immediately!+",1524441600,,306,4.333333333333333
8229603,5,B000XT1P5C,These three movies are so quaint in a good way.  The language is adorable and easy to follow AND makes sense the way Tammy looks at the world and other people.  Very enjoyable watching.,1524009600,,185,4.411764705882353
