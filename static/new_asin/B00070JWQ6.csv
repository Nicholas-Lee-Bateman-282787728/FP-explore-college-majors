8044500,3,B00070JWQ6,"These episodes are in the public domain.  That's why you keep seeing the same ones over and over on DVD.  Most of the series is still copywrighted...and apparently no one has yet decided to remaster them and get them out on DVD.  I would recommend these only to the curious who have never seen Lucy's work after I LOVE LUCY.  The sound and picture is inferior on almost all releases...they are mostly mastered from each other or from video tape.  Sometimes, they have even been taped off TV and mastered from that.

The music is missing or different because it has its own copywright, and is obviously not yet in the public domain.  Hence, something else is substituted, usually some cheesy public-domain stuff like radio stations use for local commercials.

There are episodes of THE DICK VAN DYKE show out there which are the same as well.  Bad copies...no music.

[...] You'll laugh, and you'll enjoy seeing an older Lucy.  If you spend a buck and expect a family keepsake...well, just what do you want for a buck?",1129593600,2,1017,4.657303370786517
8044501,1,B00070JWQ6,"I cannot comment on this release because I haven't seen it and will not. The fact that it is the same episodes that have been released in the past is a bad sign. After trying to find DVD's of this series for a while, I can tell you the way this series has been released is the worst I've ever seen, so I've given up until there is a proper release. I love the early  years in Danville (? Danford?) with Viv especially - even more than ""I Love Lucy"". Maybe someday it will get a proper release.",1109203200,5,493,4.030612244897959
8044502,3,B00070JWQ6,I purchased this dvd at target for only a dollar. It wasn't even worth it. For one thing the picture is not good and neither is the sound. And believe it or not it doesn't even have the original music like it always does. so don't waist your dollar. Maybe someday they will release THE LUCY SHOW in box sets of each season that have been restored picture and sound and have special  features like trivia and biographies and pictures.and that have original commercials.,1107043200,8,468,4.571428571428571
