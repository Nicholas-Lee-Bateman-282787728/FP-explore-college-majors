6647720,4,B00NE52T6Q,"I bought this thinking I would get a little stronger, but nothing much.  Just looking for a different workout.  This DVD is CRAZY.  I'm in love.  It's a bit intimidating at first, but honestly the more you do it the easier it becomes because the routines are the same for each section.  My mother whom has started this with me can do it as well and she really likes that she has been able to see results in how she does each exercise (more correctly than before) after 2 weeks.  Very impressed with these DVD's.",1459814400,21,511,4.326315789473684
6647721,5,B00NE52T6Q,"I really love this workout! It's quick, and hard.  Every time I do it I'm sore.  I am half way through phase 2. I have lost inches, and can feel I'm getting stronger.  I highly recommend getting this workout, but you can get it for under $50 if you go directly to his site.",1458172800,13,273,4.018518518518518
6647722,5,B00NE52T6Q,"I love this workout! I have gained so much stamina and strength. 15 minutes 3 times a week is so easy to fit in. I am 59 and I think anyone can do this. Dr Jade loves it when you do the burn, and then REST..",1455840000,27,207,3.5217391304347827
6647723,5,B00NE52T6Q,"I am shocked that this is sold here at such a high price! You can get the entire Metabolic Aftershock system for less than $50 on the official Metabolic Aftershock website. For 10 workouts, the price is unbeatable. The workouts are awesome so there is nothing to lose. Try it and you'll see!

First, some history. I am no stranger to workouts and workout programs. I have been working out 3-4x/week for the past ~25 years (since age 17!) and have tried just about every workout program there is: The Firm, Tae-Bo, Body Pump, Jillian Michaels' workouts (including one of my all-time favorites: 30 Day Shred), Wii Zumba, pilates, yoga, karate, ballet conditioning, and several Beachbody workouts including Turbo Jam and Hip Hop Abs.

Metabolic Aftershock is a 9 week program that will re-set your metabolism and turn you into a fat-burning machine. What's different about these workouts is that they are self-paced. ""Push hard, rest hard."" Do not pace yourself! This is critical. The rest means you can push harder, which releases the maximum amount of growth hormones.

This is the only program I know of that incorporates half-moves and quarter-moves (i.e. ""pulsings"") in addition to full range of movement exercises. What is a half-range and quarter-range move? As an example, with a squat, a full range of movement would be to squat as low as you can (using good form, of course!) then standing all the way up. A half-move means you would squat low but only come up halfway. A quarter-move means you would ""pulse"" in small quarter movements from the lowest position. These half and quarter moves are very effective and will exhaust your muscles quickly. This is why the short workouts are so effective.

You will track your results by assessing your SHMEC: Sleep, hunger, mood, energy, and cravings. You know the program is working for you and your hormones are in balance when you are sleeping like a baby every night, you are not hungry between meals, you are in a good mood, your energy is high, and you are not experiencing cravings.

Each workout is 15 minutes long. Work out 3x/week with at least 1 day of rest in between workouts. For maximum results, do not work out concurrently with another program. This means no weight lifting, no running, no kickboxing, etc. Walking is encouraged, though. This was very important for me, as my cortisol levels were elevated for so long due to over-exerting myself in my workouts. At first you will think you're not doing enough but trust the system as it is. It's just 9 weeks of your life.

I purchased the Metabolic Aftershock program back in May 2014 and followed the program exactly as it's written:
1) Start with the 1st DVD (contains 3 workouts). Do all 3 workouts the first week. Repeat for 3 weeks.
2) In the 4th week, move to the 2nd DVD. Do all 3 workouts that week. Repeat for 3 weeks.
3) In the 7th week, move to the 3rd DVD. Do all 3 workouts that week. Repeat for 3 weeks.
4) At the end of the 9th week, you have completed the program!

I had amazing results. I didn't lose much weight to speak of (and I didn't need to lose weight) but I totally re-shaped my body, lost fat, and built sexy muscle. Friends and family members were asking what I was doing differently.

Almost 2 years later and I am still following this program. I did another 9 week program immediately after the first, but ever since then I just randomly choose one of the 9 workouts 3x/week and do a quick workout. There is no excuse with such an easy, results-oriented program. Plus, when I take a break of a week or more, I can feel it because my SHMEC gets out of balance.

Also, since this program is low-impact, I no longer have knee problems like I did when I was working out with the Insanity program.

I feel great and I look great. I am so thankful for the cutting-edge research of Dr. Jade Teta and, for the first time in my life in my 40s, a workout program that really works for me! I am a big fan.",1454371200,98,3942,4.53943661971831

6647725,4,B00NE52T6Q,"I was skeptical when I got this, but I lost a pant size in the first week as promised following the Rapid Results first week plan! I like this program: it's short and sweet and to the point (although details are covered if you want to read them, you don't need them for this routine to work). The diet is easy to follow (as far as complexity - it's SIMPLE).I am only starting into my fourth week , second phase, but so far I am delighted! I have lost weight, look better, feel better, have more energy, sleep better and no longer have heartburn! People who don't  know I was doing this have commented on how good I look and notice that I have lost weight. I'm looking forward to continuing into the next 2 phases of this program.",1431216000,65,729,4.244604316546763
6647726,2,B00NE52T6Q,"well i really cant say if I like it or not because when I got it,  it didn't work.  But the one I got it from refunded my money I would like to try this tho but maybe later on.",1430352000,18,176,3.375

8677575,5,B00NE52T6Q,"At middle age with significant arthritis, this has been a great program for me.  I have to modify a lot, especially the whole getting down and up from the floor thing, but this is the first program I've found with any significant intensity that I can modify well enough to get a high intensity workout, and regularly at that.  I love that it's 15 minutes--any more and there's a problem with my joints.  I like doing a prescribed slow walk afterward, although I only do about 10 minutes of walking afterward.  Yes, the strict diet he says to follow and the ""long"" walk afterward is not really covered in the marketing, and I'm sure if you added in those parts you'd lose a significant amount of weight.  My goal is to try to maintain and regain joint mobility, muscle strength (as much as is possible around damaged joints,) and stamina.  So far, this has been the best option I've found, and I've tried all kinds of programs, including Beachbody, etc.  The high intensity aspect of these workouts is just 15 minutes long, whereas something like TaiCheng is 80 minutes every day and eats up a lot of floor space.  Who has that kind of time?  I love Metabolic Aftershock, and it has helped me to regain some physical strength and ability.",1520294400,3,1237,4.5610859728506785
8677576,5,B00NE52T6Q,Great workout without equipment!  Yes it's basic but if you do it with intensity & consistency you will get results in a more toned body.  To lose weight your eating plan will be the key component.,1519171200,,197,4.444444444444445
8677577,5,B00NE52T6Q,"This product is EXCELLENT especially for beginners who want resistance training but just are not accustomed to heavy weight training. Dr. Teta is so inspirational throughout the video and explains all the ""why's"" as to why this works. You can  make this easier or harder. I've added 3 lb. dumb bells to some of the exercises to get an extra boost. For anyone who wants to start any muscle building/resistance training regiment to their workout, THIS IS THE PLACE TO START. I've had these DVD for years and I LOVE them and plan on continuing with it.",1515801600,,549,4.65979381443299

8677579,2,B00NE52T6Q,"""Walking is one of the most important components of the program."" This little nugget is from the ""Rapid Results Quick Start Guide"" that comes with the package. While I purchase many things on Amazon, this I bought from the product website. Had I read about the walking requirement I would not have purchased it because I leave my house in the morning when it is dark and do not return until after dark, so walking is out of the question.",1491350400,5,437,4.475
8677580,1,B00NE52T6Q,I am so disappointed.  Description reads this is a DVD.  I only received a little booklet.  Not enough information to do the workouts or learn about the program with out the DVD.  Buyer beware....it was used.,1488412800,12,208,4.694444444444445
8677581,3,B00NE52T6Q,"I am in my 6th week of using the newer version of this program (Metabolic Prime) and I have not lost any weight. Instead I gained a few pounds. I am 39 and female, struggling with mid-life weight creep. I was very thin and a runner when I was younger so this is something of a shock to me, as I used to struggle to gain weight. I've gained four or five pounds since I started this program. Hopefully it's muscle (my clothes still fit the same.) I have a knee injury and I generally found the workouts doable, but there is no advice for dealing with injuries other than ""If it hurts, don't do it."" I find if I am careful with my form on squats I am okay, but they are very painful for my knee if my form is even the slightest bit off. The three variations in the program are without weights, with weights, and with bands so there aren't really any special options if you have injuries you need to work around. I have gotten stronger since I started the program and the exercises are easier. I can feel that my legs are more muscular (always the fittest part of me) and firm. But I am quite depressed that I haven't lost any weight around my midsection nor do I look any more toned in that area. Part of this may be my fault. I had originally intended to follow the diet that came with this program, but it is very expensive. I spent triple in one week what I normally spend at the grocery. I can't afford this. This left me to the frustration of trying to make substitutions. The reading materials suggest some unlucky people just have a harder time losing weight than others and that you have to play detective to figure out what causes weight gain for you and what helps you lose. I had better luck with a Greek yogurt diet than I did with this program. (And in the diet that comes with this yogurt is a no-no.) I am going to keep doing the workout because it fits my lifestyle and I have seen some improvements, but I need another plan to lose weight.",1467849600,14,1953,4.196808510638298
8677582,1,B00NE52T6Q,"Six weeks into this I have GAINED weight - and this on a low-carb diet and with Crohn's disease. No, I have not upped my intake of anything fattening. Yes, I have done the bloody exercises religiously. Even bought the really expensive supplement. I was already working out regularly, so maybe this only shows big changes if you weren't? But all the hype? Please ignore. This program has done absolutely nothing for me except inexplicably add two pounds. (Muscle? Okay, maybe, but I was already doing strength training and silk aerial and looking to lose inexplicable stomach bulk that's been piling on...)",1465862400,15,605,4.9411764705882355
