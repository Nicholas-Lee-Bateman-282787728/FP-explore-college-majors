7963565,5,B000067JHO,"I was lucky enough to grow up with regular visits to the San Diego Zoo.  This DVD has great footage of animals up close and excellent music.  It really holds my daughter's interest and she requests it.  It is nothing like a Little Einstein DVD (no inane and unskilled puppetry), and I am really thankful for that.  I plan to buy more DVDs by the same folks to made ""A Trip to the San Diego Zoo.""",1179360000,,395,4.157894736842105
7963566,5,B000067JHO,"If you want the true experience of the San Diego Zoo, this is the movie for you! We bought the movie after our trip to the San Diego Zoo and the kids loved that all of the places they were seeing on the t.v were what we had seen at the zoo. There is so much footage of the animals in their habitats and in action and not a lot else and that was exactly what we were looking for.",1141862400,,378,3.7375
7963567,5,B000067JHO,My 18 month old daughter got this video as a Xmas gift and loves it.  She is not interested in watching TV in general unless there are animals on TV.  We watch occasionally before nap/bedtime or lately when we were all home sick.  The background music is nice and allows you to discuss the video with your child.  She now talks about what the animals are doing during the video and tries to count or say ABCs when they come up on the screen.,1140566400,,441,4.214285714285714
7963568,5,B000067JHO,"From my 5 month old to my 20 month old, BOTH are actually entertained the ENTIRE length of the DVD.  I am so happy with this DVD it is unbelievable.  I even purchased two portable DVD players for our vehicle because they wanted to watch it all the time and because they currently face different directions in the car, I have had to purchase a second DVD of this video.  I recommend this to anyone who has a child interested in animals or just likes to listen to classical music and view animals without having to listen to quarky talk overs from adults trying to catch the attention of your little one.  This DVD does not need any help in its attention getting!!! WE LOVE this DVD!!! Thank you so much.  More zoos should have Baby Genius put out a DVD on their parks.  THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!",1121212800,,791,4.3108108108108105
7963569,5,B000067JHO,"We have all of the Baby Genius videos.  We love to watch the ""Trip to the Zoo"", because we visit the Zoo frequently.  ... He loves all of the videos!  The music is pleasing to the ear.  ... Baby Genius has classical music being played by a symphony or an orchestra.  I couldn't stand the keyboard stuff. (We hear the music too!) I don't think the video moves too slow, it's a perfect pace, and it makes for a good quiet time activity.",1047427200,,434,4.180722891566265
7963570,5,B000067JHO,I have 10 month old twin daughters.  They love this video! They love the music and don't want to miss a second watching the animals.  I think it's a great introduction to animals for them. We can't wait to bring them to the zoo when it's warmer but for days we can't this video is fun for them.,1045440000,,294,4.051724137931035
7963571,5,B000067JHO,"The very first time we put this video in, our two year old was hooked.  And to tell you the truth, my husband and I were, too!  Our son loves animals and these in the video are so active and seem to be having so much fun.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a child.",1030924800,,277,3.7413793103448274
