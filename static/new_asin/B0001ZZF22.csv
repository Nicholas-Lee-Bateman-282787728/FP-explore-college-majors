2049907,5,B0001ZZF22,"I was happy to see the camera angles and set ups changing so many times. Because of this choice by the editor, I was able to view so many places along the beaches in just one day. I was taken back by how clear the sound was and that there were no unwanted sounds or voices. The DVD was picturesque, and full of the natural beauty of those beaches. I found the entire experience of viewing the DVD to be totally relaxing. I felt as if I were almost there on the beaches of the Virgin Islands. I have taken the video and recorded the sound onto a cassette, so that I can listen to the waves hitting the shore, in my vehicle while I drive into and out of Los Angeles each day. Just the sounds alone can be fully relaxing. But to be able to get home and view the beaches with the full view is a bonus. I must recommend this DVD to anyone who needs a rest from the day to day grind of the city and life itself. Thank you for the superb filming of this Hot Vacation spot. I was so impressed with the clarity of the DVD.",1087689600,4,1013,3.9705882352941178
2049908,3,B0001ZZF22,"This could have been a great DVD but nearly every scene is underexposed.  The beach, waves, and near shore water is okay but could be brighter.  And I guess that is the important part.  But the surrounding hills are always black and without any detail.  The sky, when it should be bright blue is a dull dark blue to gray.  I have three other nature DVDs:  Australian Outback; Bora Bora: a day in Paradise; and Soothing Waters: Ore and Cal.  All have very good to excellant video quality.  On the plus side, this video has excellant audio.  The scenery is great -- what can be seen.  The individual scenes are long enough to give a feeling of being there.  And the between scene graphics are brief and unobtrusive. The sunset scenes are the best exposed.  I'll watch this again and again, but with sadness at what it could have been.",1084233600,5,832,4.473333333333334
2049909,5,B0001ZZF22,The Best Virgin Island Beaches seem to be a little quiter than the Caribbean and Bahama ones but is still very enjoyable. The waves are lapping to ocassionally little wavelets and very calm but mostley lapping. There are diving pelicans thru out the dvd starting with day 2. There is even doves I forgot what day on but you can only hear them and not see them. You only hear them once. This one also has more mountains or hills than the other 2. Also the world famous baths is on this dvd. There are also a couple of sail boats. The video on this dvd seems to be crisp. The waves want to make you go to the Virgin Islands and stick your feet in them and the water looks so clear. Every day ends with beautiful sunsets over the Virgin Islands. I highley recommend the Virgin Island Beaches along with the best Bahama Beaches and Caribbean Beaches. I also recommend Caribbean Daydreams. This one will be much different than these 3 as you won't have at least 5 or more shots on each day you will have 1 shot on each day that will last about 10 minutes and it will include the best beaches of the Caribbean. I can't wait to get this one for my collection. It should be out shortley.,1083456000,4,1179,4.2444444444444445
2049910,5,B0001ZZF22,i thought i left a review on this before. it's not here so will add one now as it's worth mentioning again. granddaughter loved it. works as a nightlight and loops..put her to sleep in minutes. I have a chronic pain condition and when the pain is too intense to bare or waiting for pain meds to start working..i put this tape on. two full video's on one CD makes it really worth the price. would also be good in medical waiting rooms. even the sound of the ocean with the pictures off is great or the pictures with the sound off works. nice white noise when the neighbors dogs are barking all night too. i can't say enough wonderful things about this! Highly recommend.,1367798400,,669,4.36
2049911,5,B0001ZZF22,I bought this DVD 5 years ago and still love it as much today as the first time I popped it in and played it.  Great for relaxing with a book or getting a massage or meditating.  Especially wonderful after a rough day and you need to be brought back to a calm and peaceful place.,1311033600,,279,3.9642857142857144
2049912,5,B0001ZZF22,"We have this DVD on a virtual endless loop, pretty much daily - every time I look at it, it makes me remember the VG sands under my toes. Beautiful views, nothing but the sound of waves, no goofy music, the best way to transport yourself to the best paradise on earth - the BVI's. Been there 7+times, and know that of which I speak/write. Don't miss it.",1258070400,,353,4.205882352941177

An hours CD and video of some of the beautiful beaches of the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean. Quiet and restful it captures some of the beauty of the Islands and the background sounds of the waves rolling onto the beach. Great to capture that feeling of inner peace and tranquility. As a regular visitor to the BVI's we have been to some of the bays and beaches and yes that is what they are really like!

The producer has not tried to add complexity to the natural beauty on display and this makes a great background to those moments when you just want a quiet time and space in which to consider life's ups or downs!

Don't expect sophistication or whizzy photographic tricks!",1207958400,2,910,5.676470588235294
2049914,2,B0001ZZF22,"This DVD is a nice idea- basically, they just planted a camera on a beach and you can sit and watch as if you were there- you watch the birds go by etc. But since they aren't really providing any content, you'd think they'd use the best camera they could find, but they didn't. The quality of the images is really bad- very 2-dimensional. It's very low resolution. Almost like a video that's been put onto a DVD. And the colors are flat and wrong-looking. The sound is fine- of the waves. Too bad the images aren't better.",1196467200,,522,4.336734693877551
2049915,5,B0001ZZF22,"I bought this DVD along with Bora Bora, A Day in Paradise. If you are looking for something relaxing this is it.  I was on the verge of emotional catastrophe before I bought these two DVDs, from too much TV, too much music, too much distressing noise and going for too long without a vacation (a budget issue).  Sometime ago I went in search of some relaxation help.  I found some budget DVDs by David Fortney.  I own at least 6 of them, Majestic National Parks, Quiet Moods (very relaxing if you mute the music), Earth Flight, Desert Flight, Reflections (my favorite) and Visions of Light.  These are great if you just want something awesome to look at, but honestly some of them put me on edge when I'd watch them in the evening.  There is a lot of timelapsed photography, fast moving clouds, etc.  Virgin Islands is totally different, there are just steady restful shots of some of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen.  Virgin Gorda is my favorite as the ocean gently laps at the shore and the water is so crystal clear that you just want to sit down and let it wash over you.  The scenes are simple and relaxing and there is no music, narration or any other intrusive noises to disturb your experience.  There are subtitles at the bottom of the scene when it changes but it is only there for a few seconds.  I understand that these have been removed on newer versions of other Virtual Vacations.

Bora, Bora is the same, just quiet waves and waterfalls and the faint sounds of birds.  The scenery in Bora Bora is beautiful as well and oh yes there is a faint thunder storm but it isn't disturbing.  There are no subtitles to disturb your relaxation experience and the only complaint I have is that it isn't long enough.  With these you can fall asleep without any problem.  My sister is a Dental Assistant and her employer uses these in her practice.  Her patients love them.  If you can't relax after 15 minutes of one of these, then you are defintitely a type A personality.  Voevodsky says he is thinking about doing one called Nature Walks.  I hope he does.  If you would be interested contact him at Powerfloe.com.

I've played these DVDs nearly everyday since I purchased them.  I'm now finding that I need some different scenery so I don't habituate.  I've searched around but haven't found any that don't include music or some narration.  If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.  I need them.  Thanks.",1107475200,19,2431,4.528735632183908
2049916,5,B0001ZZF22,"These are wonderful videos for any former jet-setter, now stuck at home with family.  You can put on a DVD and remember that vacations won't always be visits with the family!  It's a half hour vacation.

They are also wonderful for meditators who don't have time to sit.  Having these beautiful images and sounds in the background during the day makes any room an instant zen retreat.  The videos even calm my twins down after a hectic day!",1101340800,7,440,4.589743589743589
2049917,5,B0001ZZF22,I found this dvd as well as Bahamas Beaches a wonderful way to rest and relax. They made me feel like I was sitting on the waters edge. My husband who is an alzheimer patient found it very soothing and calming. It has become a special time in the day for him to just relax. I urge anyone to purchase these two DVD's - sit back and relax - and put yourself right there. If you can't get to these two places - this is the next best thing. Thank you so much to WAVES Virtual Vacations - you have been a great help to myself and my husband. Keep up the good work.,1089936000,13,559,3.912280701754386
2049918,5,B0001ZZF22,"I LOOOOVE this video.  The quality of the images and the sound is simply amazing.  I really feel like I am in the Virgin Islands when I watch it!  I use it while I am walking on my treadmill and pretend I am walking on the beach.  It makes my boring treadmill walk seem like paradise.  I feel like I have stumbled onto a secret that the general public has not yet caught up to.  These videos are truly ""virtual vacations.""  So far, Virgin Island Beaches is my favorite!  You won't be sorry!",1088985600,10,490,4.193548387096774
2049919,5,B0001ZZF22,"Greg Voevodsky has delivered treasures (buried chests of gold doubloons?) in his series of Virtual Vacations. I'd searched in vain for faithful recordings of nature at her best until I encountered his work.  VIRGIN ISLANDS contains no Muzac or classical or New Age background music to 'help'. Like all the other offerings, it is pristine in its desire to give you a set of well-chosen examples of why people rave about these locations.  What you get is long still shots of white sand beaches merging with aquamarine waters overhung by palms and other lush tropical vegetation, and with it just the ambient sound of nature in that place.  Being too long between real vacations, I was mesmerized by the languid waves and soothing sun.  I felt like I could step through the screen and be there. The sense of immediacy and tangibility is amazing, like the filmaker's disciplined restraint. Valium sales will plummet!  You only need buy Virtual Vacations once, and they are totally side effect free.",1088208000,6,994,4.92814371257485
8019269,3,B0001ZZF22,"While the video quality is good, it's disappointing that you can't go true widescreen on these DVDs.  There is a significant border box that takes up 25% of the screen.",1504569600,,168,4.6

8019278,5,B0001ZZF22,"Having been to the Caribbean, there is just nothing like it for relaxing sounds and picturesque views that just take your mind away from the daily hustle and bustle of every day life.  Just sitting in a chair in the family room, watching these DVDs (on a 50 inch screen is awesome), playing some steel drum music in the background and drinking something cool with a cocktail umbrella in it just soothes away the stress.  I originally purchased these DVDs for a tropical themed party I was throwing, and had them playing on two t.v.'s upstairs and downstairs, it was very effective in creating the mood for the themed party!  But we pop in the DVDs whenever we just want to unwind and chill from a hectic week.  It is a virtual vacation, truly.",1378339200,,743,4.522388059701493
