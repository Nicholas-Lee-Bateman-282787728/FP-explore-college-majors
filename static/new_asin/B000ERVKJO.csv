2532263,4,B000ERVKJO,"When I first saw this movie I enjoyed it enough to want to include it into my limited library of other movies.  The development of a relationship between three adults maybe difficult for some to want to view but this relationship was because of circumstances that were what life brings to people who are not always working in the direction of respect and responsibility.

I admired and sympathized with the need to keep a family together and trying to work against the tide of reality.  The reality being that the husband is immature, self centered, and has a on going gambling problem that leads to lies, loss of much needed monies, and promises that will not be fulfilled.  The actor who plays the part of the husband does a fine job in conveying to the audience his negatives and the circumstances of life that makes changes in his characters attitude.

Judith LIght is very good and her performance brings to life a women who is willing to work hard for her family and who wants to meet her own need to move forward.  Unfortunately, she doesn't want to accept soon enough that her energizes are being wasted.  The husband and wife both have issues with seeing things as they are and nipping the problems in the bud.

 Judith LIght's character shows the struggles financially and emotionally to the family and how they are impacted.  The changes that will eventually become her new life and the introduction of another man who is far more supportive of her, the goals of financial success, and bringing happiness into her life become a driving force to get out of the life that she has lived with for so long.  The relationship with the boyfriend is slowly developed and is not gone into overnight.

The college age children in this movie come and go in the film,  but their feelings of confusion, hurt, anger are made clear and are not resolved even at the end of the movie.  The children are not seen accepting the dynamics of three.

Another viewer considered this movie to be sub par.  Not if you are looking for a movie that moves along, tells a story that is more real than fiction and has good acting.  A chick flick maybe but a very good one!",1382400000,2,2153,4.55064935064935

2532267,5,B000ERVKJO,"We watched a really good movie tonight titled A Strange Affair starring

Judith Light and Jay Thomas. It was a very powerful poly film based of

real events. Judith's character is that of a wife who is very unhappy in

her marriage to Jay Thomas's character because his is a gambler and a

philanderer. When he steals the money that she has set aside to start her

own business, that's the end for her and she leaves him. The night she

leaves, he has a stroke, her college-aged children get ahold of her and she

returns. She commits to caring for him. She takes her car in for repairs

and meets Art. A friendship develops between she and Art. The friendship turns to love.

Eventually the three setup housekeepping.

The above description makes it sound easy. It's not. The movie deals with

the conflicts of obligation, social stigma, and loving. It clearly shines

a light on the positive side of loving more than one, but also shows the

work and devotion it takes to enrich such relationships.

I was in tears by the end of the movie. I felt inspired by the characters,

even Jay Thomas's (difficult as he was a real scumbag in the beginning).

Personal growth occurred in them all. I strongly reccommend this made for

TV movie.",1132358400,19,1236,4.545454545454546
2532268,1,B000ERVKJO,"I can't believe that this sub-par TV movie is available now on DVD!!  When it was first aired, it was titled ""A Husband, A Wife and a Lover."" It is thoroughly outrageous, laughable and a supreme embarrassment to those actors who are in it.  It is the story of a man who comes to live in the couple's household.  The stranger is attracted to Judith Light's character, but of course she is married and will not lower herself to have an affair.  Somewhere along the line she tosses aside any shred of morality she has and succumbs to their unspoken mutual ""passion."" Later on it is discovered that the husband has become terminally ill (which I suppose makes Light and her lover free to rationalize that their sweaty and lurid encounter was really ""o.k."").  They all come to terms with the ""affair"" and the husband unbelievably accepts the fact that his wife is sleeping with another man while they are all living under the same roof!  They become a perverted ""Three Musketeers"" if you will.  The whole scenario is extremely absurd.  Toward the end of the movie, Judith Light and her lover border on abusive as they cheer on the ailing husband as he struggles to crawl to the mailbox! If it all weren't so outlandish, I would call an agency that defends the terminally ill from such exploitation.  This movie gets absolutely no stars for quality, but gets five + stars for moronic dialogue and plot! For those of you who like to kick back and offer your own armchair sarcasm to underscore such made-for-TV schlock---this one is a real winner!",1089849600,4,1539,4.6286764705882355
8113714,5,B000ERVKJO,"I cant handle this movie, or Judith Light. The acting is typical Monday night movie from the 90s. And the story is cringeworthy. But I cant look away. Is it because its a lazy Sunday and its the only thing on television right now? Is it because its the dad from Boy Meets World? Guys like him have never existed (the airplane, Art?! Really? I dated a guy who never bought me a birthday present but this guys just giving and spending like hes not blue collar and self employed. Ive got some bills and items Id like to buy if anyone knows a real life Art). I know its not because of Angela from Whos the Boss because shes irritated me in everything shes ever been in. Did grown men behave this way over a woman in the 90s instead of Facebook feuds and front yard throw downs, and I just don't remember? Why is she calling both of these men pet names? What is this scene/speech with the daughter after she figures out the truth? Am I just a prude? I need to meet someone that had a similar experience in real life to explain this storyline to me; my mind might explode by the time this is over from all of my questions.
Edit: Ive made it to the end of the show. Id just like the point out that I was so knocked over by Judith Lights behavior, I overlooked the writers lack of experience with Eric/Aarons (couldnt really understand his name in Judiths tone of voice) medical issues. After working in a nursing home for far too long, thats not how it would have happened from the get go. I bet theres lots of people whove been to see the doctor due the same medical situation who would have been thrilled they made it out as well as he did, and dude was a total douche the entire time. Most people are unhappy in the beginning but that situation seems to humble most people. If anyone remakes this movie, email me. Well pick this apart line by line. Ill even let Judith make a cameo as a nurse. In the meantime, only watch this version when you literally have nothing else to do.",1515283200,,1974,4.224867724867725
