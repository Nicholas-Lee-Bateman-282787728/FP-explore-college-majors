Unfortunately, Arliss doesn't don the mask much, but you do get the sense that he is quite capable of being as ruthless as any pirate in many respects. There are no DVD extras, just the 80 minute movie. Such a shame that Arliss isn't better remembered today - a top actor and stage personality in his day.",1381968000,5,778,6.280373831775701
2421779,4,6303250750,"This was a good enjoyable action movie to enjoy. Good story which showed us the basis of the future Scarecrow of Romney Marsh. I enjoyed that one better. And while I am on that I hope that re-release the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh - it is unfair that only a small amount was produced and now to buy one your have to pay a arm & leg to get the dvd.
Come on Disney pullyour finhers out surely it doesnt take that much to re-release the dvd again surely!!!

2421780,5,6303250750,the tape is in excellent shape.  I have been doing business with amazon for over 4 years now and they are the best.,1201392000,,115,4.0
2421781,3,6303250750,"I purchased this movie since I was such a fan of Disney's ""The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" starring Patrick McGoohan. This ""Dr Syn"" is worth seeing, but you'll appreciate it more if you've already read the original ""Dr Syn"" book by Russell Thorndike. I was disappointed that there wasn't more action in the movie, but George Arliss does a good job as the title character, and it was interesting to see an older, cagier Dr Syn -- one at the end of his career. If you do decide to buy this edition of ""Dr Syn,"" be advised that the VHS copy I received was grainy and it can be difficult to see some scenes that take place at night. Bottom line: Buy this if you're a fan of the ""Dr Syn"" series. It's good, but I much prefer the 3 episode ""Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" that Disney made.",1153526400,5,778,4.263513513513513
2421782,5,6303250750,"What would Long John Silver be like in old age, if his better half had won out? This 1930's British movie version of Russell Thorndike's novel gives us a clue. George Arliss, one of the greats of the British stage and an early star of Hollywood talkies, gives an excellent final performance in the title role. It's a switch for Arliss, who won an Oscar in the title role of ""Disraeli"" and usually played similar, elegant roles. Never afraid of a new role, he boldly quits the silver screen as an aging buccaneer!
Dr. Syn is a retired pirate the world believes to have been hanged. In fact, he has taken up a second career as the parish pastor of Dimchurch, near the real-world Romney Marsh on the southern English coast. But Syn has brought some of his pirate crew along and together, they are secretly smuggling. Syn gives his smuggling profits for a new schoolhouse and for the town's poor. ""I've used the money better than the king and I haven't had to pay any duties,"" he brags. But there's also that pirate side. ""I've known the Scarecrow (Syn's smuggling code name) longer than any of you,"" says his chief lieutenant to the rest of the gang, ""and sometimes I'm mortally afraid of him.""
You'll find this drama well-acted all around, including a class-crossed romance for Margaret Lockwood in the role of Syn's daughter (who doesn't know her father is Dr. Syn, advising her not to hope the squire's dashing son will wed her). The Navy captain who stumbles his way toward the truth, learning to appreciate the ironic name of the town, is amusing, but able. He fights for the law, yet somehow lets you keep rooting for Arliss/Syn. The heavy of the tale, a mute, violent mulatto, is politically incorrect - but we see how he's been used by both sides so badly and feel sympathy for him. There's intrigue, betrayal and suspense. The story is well-paced and witty. A fine yarn for all viewers over the age of ten and a fine thespian finale for Arliss.  END",897177600,32,1955,4.56980056980057
8087928,5,6303250750,"Fans of Walt Disney's ""The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh"" will relish this earlier rendition of the tale of pirates and smugglers pitted against King George's revenue agents and press gangs.  Certainly George Arliss delivers a different, albeit highly effective, portrayal of the Reverend Dr. Syn than Patrick McGoohan; however, the earlier version may well be truer to Thorndyke's original.  For various reasons, some of them nostalgic, the Disney miniseries remains my favorite interpretation, but ""Dr. Syn"" is well worth watching.  Avast, mateys!",1518912000,,545,5.621951219512195

Arliss' voice projection and clarity are excellent.  I'm no expert on UK accents, but he sounds refined and upper class throughout it.  I think they'd call it posh these days.",1484438400,,347,4.60655737704918

8087934,4,6303250750,"This antique of a movie is reasonably faithful to the sprit of the Russell Thorndike adventure novel by the same name that spawned a series of prequels in the early 20th century. Produced decades before Disney's Scarecrow of Romney March TV episodes, I suspect this film never had a large American audience. But it's fast-paced and displays a high level of authenticity regarding the 18th century smuggling trade in the south of England. As fine an actor as diminutive George Arliss seems to have been, it's a bit much to accept him as the pirate captain half of his dual identify (he's assumed a disguise as a clergyman). Also, the copy of the film used to produce this CD was in atrocious shape. But fans of the Dr. Syn saga should find the very Britishness of the movie to be a large part of its charm.",1457222400,,805,4.52054794520548
8087935,4,6303250750,very interesting version  of Dr. Syn for those of us raised on the Disneys. This is one of the best copies I've seen. It's not from a master print nor is it digitally remastered but the copy is clear and the sound is good. No extras (pity) but the price makes it worth owning.
