Movie Review: This the 2nd Rica movie in a series of 3. This one was actually good. I don't know if it's better than the 1st, however. It's a little less violent than the first, Rica doesn't show her boobs or her PERFECT BUTT. However, the story is a little better. Anyways, I liked it. It's does have enough bloody violence to satisfy the average movie psycho, pathetic but entertaining karate action, Rica's butt continues to titillate my pecker and a story. *shruggs*

Conclusion: 4 stars for the movie and 4 stars for Rica: Lonely Wanderer.",1425945600,,634,4.807339449541284
