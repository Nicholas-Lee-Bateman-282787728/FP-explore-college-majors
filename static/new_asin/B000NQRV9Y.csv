I think if more focus was put on refining the storyline it would have been a lot better. But even still, it was not awful. It's a permanent addition to my collection of Spanish movies from Spain.",1314057600,,334,4.317460317460317
8181007,5,B000NQRV9Y,"The films depicts a stable family, each with their own differences but always living with a sense of solidarity. It was well done and does the movie justice by having Fernn-Gmez (now deceased) play an important role.",1311465600,,216,4.864864864864865
8181008,3,B000NQRV9Y,"I rent this movie and end up buying it because of Fernando Fernan Gomez he is an excellent actor and he plays the grandfather of David in this film. Basically, this movie centers around the characters emotions and it is a bit confusing had to see it twice, it can be depressing but it centers around an important message about family and tragedy. If your a fan of Fernando Fernan Gomez, try ""La Lengua de las Mariposas"", he is an excellent actor. I think I enjoy this film because of his performance.",1228867200,,500,4.445652173913044
8181009,5,B000NQRV9Y,"This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors all do a marvelous job playing their parts, and the twists and turns during the movie are both clever and unexpected. Although, make sure to keep a tissue box nearby, because this movie is quite sad. But I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!",1203292800,,301,4.392857142857143
