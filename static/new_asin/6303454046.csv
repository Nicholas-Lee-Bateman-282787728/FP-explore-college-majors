7847512,3,6303454046,"I must admit I am a little partial since the scene (If it was Not cut out of the version you saw ?) Where the two drug suppliers go into the house  (My House !!) and shoot and kill the young couple's baby in a crib, That I helped the special effects man modify as if it was blasted with a 12 gauge shotgun. Was shot in my house. This scene is cut out of some versions, Especially because this movie was made as a two episode mini series and ran on network TV as one.
 I was told by the movie makers they originally intended to actually show the baby being shot in the crib with a shotgun, But the TV Network would not accept it.  (I believe they said it would have been the first movie to ever show a baby being shot with a shotgun) The address of the house that I lived in for 33 years is 430 Alcazar Ave. in Coral Gables, Next to and sharing a border with Miami, Fl.",1491696000,,868,3.9204545454545454
7847513,2,6303454046,"Poor video quality, poor acting, poor everything. I only gagged it two stars since its based on a true story and I believe we need more movies true story but not like this. It was so poorly done. It was horrible.",1455753600,,212,4.195121951219512

7847515,1,6303454046,"This DVD never played.  I contacted the seller who offered to send me another disk if I returned the defective one.  Shipping the item back was inconvenient to my schedule so I put if off and never sent it back.  The movie itself (I have seen elsewhere) is very dated, but otherwise very good.",1441324800,,293,4.388888888888889
7847516,3,6303454046,"The acting in this made-for-TV film is faultlessly superb, particularly that of Sophia Loren, who plays the role of a mother whose son has become a cocaine addict.
I would unhesitatingly rate the production with five stars; however, the copy I received with my purchase, manufactured by Hollywood DVD, #HOLDD010, had poor video quality and was a disappointment in that regard.  My original impression caused me to wonder whether I should be wearing 3D glasses for viewing.  Although advertised as ""fullscreen,"" my copy had wide left and right margins.",1329177600,,551,5.179775280898877
7847517,5,6303454046,"Too simplistic? Maybe, in comparison to all of today's technology both in film making and in drug busting and business, and in spite of the lack of endless blood and gore to drive home the content. But seeing it for the first time 20 years after it was made still kept me entirely in the moment of the movie. Sophia wasn't an unrealistic beauty queen for this movie. Her character was that of a proud, intelligent and dignified mother. The casting of key characters such as Hector Elizondo was on target, and Billy D Williams brightened this family movie without ever overwhelming the contrast of the quiet determination of Sophia's role.",1314489600,2,638,4.756756756756757
7847518,5,6303454046,"The real life story of a woman (Sophia Loren) who risks her life by taking part in an undercover operation. Her son's life is being destroyed by his dependency on drugs.
