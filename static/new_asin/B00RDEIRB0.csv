Five INDIE Stars! ""Time Lapse"" is a very different type of 'time travel' movie in a genre that has produced a number of 'time travel' independent films in recent years. It is built almost entirely on the merits of the young actors involved who do a great job of selling the plot. An amateur painter, his girlfriend, and their live-in male friend look for a problematic apartment renter and discover he has created a machine that gives a 'window' into the near future, leading to many wild twists and unexpected turns headed towards an ending that is a big surprise. It has a cast of superb young actors including Danielle Panabaker (Justified), Matt O'Leary, George Finn, Amin Joseph, Jason Spisak, and a cameo by John Rhys-Davies of ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Sliders"" fame that may go unnoticed. Directed by Bradley King. When you try to consider what is going on it will bend your mind a little. Highly Recommended, especially to SciFi, Indie Film, and Time-Travel fans. Five ENTERTAINING Stars. (ITunes. Time-1:04. Unrated: profanity and some violence. Closed Captioned. 82% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.)",1431907200,11,1199,4.965174129353234

6928449,3,B00RDEIRB0,"I liked this cool remake of the old Twilight Zone episode ""A Most Unusual Camera"" (you can check it out on Netflix). I wish, of all things, they'd cast a more imposing actor as the bookie, as I never feared the character. But, more importantly, I thought it was a novel, compelling, interesting plot. I still don't quite get the idea that, of all the three intelligent people (ok, two), they'd not thought to have gambled elsewhere, besides from an illegal bookie - that who aspect of the film was a giant plot flaw. Fun movie, though, and while it's always a challenge to suspend disbelief in a ""time travel""-ish movie, this one played with the idea in an entertaining and well paced way.",1431820800,5,689,4.564516129032258

6928451,4,B00RDEIRB0,"The best sci-fi movies reveal, through the use of fantastic technology or futuristic scenarios, something true about the world we live in. The best time travel movies add another element, by forcing us to consider what we would do if given the keys to time itself. By those measures, Time Lapse is a great little sci-fi gem that plays with time paradoxes while adding elements of a self-contained paranoia thriller.

Like a particularly good episode of The Twilight Zone, Time Lapse has a clear destination, a clear moral, and the path to getting there is full of twists and turns. Essentially a three-hander, the story centers on struggling artist Finn (Matt O'Leary); his level-headed girlfriend Callie (The Flash's Danielle Panabaker); and gambling addict best friend, Jasper (George Finn). Their life of living paycheck to paycheck takes a turn when their next door neighbor's charred corpse is discovered in his home, with a camera pointed directly at their window. On his wall are a series of photos showing them in the living room, only to realize that one of the photos shows an event that hasn't happened yet. The trio figure they've stumbled on a camera that shows images from 24 hours into the future, and the dead man must have somehow jacked up his personal timeline.

Rather than taking a hint that screwing with time is a potentially deadly idea, they're convinced by the money-hungry Jasper to try and use it to score some much needed cash. Using the dead man's notes they come up with one major rule that can't be broken; they must be perfectly in place for when the camera takes its photo, otherwise the paradox will cause them to cease existing. The rules seem unwieldy at first, like something that could potentially bog down the film's progress, but director and co-writer Bradley King allows the situation to play out, gradually building the tension as pressure mounts on them to keep up. The situation grows murkier when Jasper's gambling becomes an issue, and his violent bookie wants to horn in on the action. Finn becomes more obsessed with his art, thus ignoring his relationship with Callie. When the camera ejects a photo showing her committing an act of betrayal, it ruptures the tenuous dynamic even further.

The character interactions are the film's strongest suit, as the actual time travel logic is a bit flimsy and doesn't hold up under scrutiny. But you believe that these three people are close friends with a complicated relationship, and watching the balance of power shift between them is fascinating. Panabaker is so stiff and straight-laced on CW's The Flash that it's good to see her in a role where she gets to be a little mysterious. There's definitely more to Callie than meets than eye.  Set basically in one cramped apartment, the modest budget is noticeable but never a distraction. Actually, setting it one place adds to the air of claustrophobia as the situation, and their mental states, unravel. Maybe one day characters will learn not to mess around with the timestream, but for now the stories of their doomed efforts will continue to entertain us. If they're half as memorable as Time Lapse then keep them coming.",1431648000,22,3170,4.8975791433891995
6928452,4,B00RDEIRB0,"Three roommates discover a camera that can take pictures of the future in their dead neighbors apartment and use it for personal gain, leading them down a very dark path. Cool idea, I can dig it. Its done really well too. The character interaction is excellent, enhanced further by some really great acting. The direction is great too, carrying a consistently solid pace. While I liked the story and how things unfolded, there was this burning needle in the back of my head that just feels like the movie could have been more impactful. It was so good and the ending was great, but could have been punched in harder. Still, a great movie.",1431216000,6,638,4.605263157894737
6928453,5,B00RDEIRB0,"Finn (Matt O'Leary) is an apartment manager who fancies himself a painter. He lives in a flat with his waitress girlfriend Callie (Danielle Panabaker)  and sports betting buddy Jasper (George Finn).  When the newspapers start to pile up at the neighbors place, they investigate only to find a camera that takes photos  a day in advance. The camera is bolted in place and faces the threesomes' living room window. This takes on interesting aspects for a gambler.  The owner of the camera has passed on and now our threesome live their lives to make sure they don' t ""mess with time"" by ensuring they match whatever the photo tells them to do.

This is a wicked good low budget sci-fi drama. The film takes some twists and then evolves into a Hitchcock style classic.  With 15 indie wins under its belt, this is one film that will make you forget ""Primer.""

6928458,4,B00RDEIRB0,"Mario Peralta (5/1/18)
I love time travel stories and my favorite TV show is Doctor Who, from the original episodes from 1963 to the latest gender-bending stories.  I thought this movie would be similar to the Twilight Zone episode about the camera that takes pictures of the future.  It turns out that Time Lapse has a higher psychotic murderous character-to-cast ratio than even the Doctor Who Christmas Special guest-starring Alex Kingston.  This movie layers double-cross with triple-cross and then quadruple-cross.  The knowledge that you can take pictures of future messages to tell yourself what to do in the past leads to a greed so great that the character survivability rate approaches that of the movie Alien.  I expected foul language in a low-budget feature but it was the unexpected, brutal murders and treachery that got to me.  The revelations of premeditated betrayal and the suspense of waiting to see who would kill whom were so disturbing that I had to press the pause control to catch my breath.  I probably could have guessed the ironic ending from the clues interspersed throughout the film if my guts hadnt been tied in a knot.  If you want to remind yourself of how good your own life is by watching a friendship degenerate into an insanity of self-delusion, greed, lust, lies, regret, revenge, ruthlessness, rampaging killers and a secret room filled with dead bodies, Time Lapse is the movie for you.",1525132800,,1427,4.966386554621849
6928459,4,B00RDEIRB0,"Although, this is a low budget production, it was well done, if you can get pass the fact that is a low prod movie, you might enjoy it. The concept and plot of the movie made it interesting, I think there were probably scenes that may have been too long and perhaps not necessary.
If this movie is remade into a big studio production it would be worth seeing.
 Acting side of it: the kids were good. They need more acting experience but they will get there. They aren't as bad as other  actors from some big Hollywood productions. I have to say they were directed very well. I can see the director knows how to work well with actors and give directions. These actors were not ""dead in the eye"", there were some thought behind their choices. The camera movement were done very well. For being a low budget i think that the technicalities were done very well.",1525046400,2,857,4.383647798742138

6928470,1,B00RDEIRB0,"As observed in other reviews, this might make a good episode of the original Twilight Zone...if it was only 20 minutes long.  Rod Serling could have told this story more fully and more satisfyingly in 20 minutes, with intro and outro credits and commercial breaks in-between.

Three roommates discover that their deceased neighbor invented a camera that takes pictures of the future, leading to greedy conflicts and eventually murder.  That's it.

The attempted subplot of one roommate secretly manipulating the photographic data is very weak and doesn't really add to the storyline; in fact, with the unnecessary plot-twists and repetitive scenes, it feels like they're trying to pad a 20-minute story into a feature film.

Which is where they make their mistake.  Your interest WILL start to fade after the 20-minute mark.",1523145600,,824,5.204545454545454

6928472,4,B00RDEIRB0,"If you could have a glimpse of the future, what would you do?

That's the question posed to three roommates when they discover a time lapse camera in an apartment across from them that takes photos 24-hours in advance.

Finn, an aspiring painter with no inspiration, and his girlfriend, Callie, are struggling as a couple and in finding a direction and success in their lives. Their roommate, Jasper, ekes out a living on dog races and booze. With the camera, the three friends think they have found a way to alleviate some of the struggles in their lives. Finn, by seeing 24 hours in advance what he will paint and Jasper, a way to win at the races. But in the mix, it's Callie that hasn't reaped from the benefits, and takes matters in her own hands to alter fate, and with horrific consequences.

What starts out as a basic 'supernatrual-like' concept, morphs into a psychological thriller in many ways. All three friends have divergent trajectories despite living within the same apartment, and yet, their fates are deeply intertwined. The most enjoyable thing was that the concept was well derived and executed. A story like this can go very awry and hokey with poor writing and conceptual follow-through but Time Lapse had many elements that kept me watching and intrigued. The story is exactly as you think it's going to be but also not, at the same time. The slight twist at the end isn't too much and makes it that much more clever.

Production, acting, all of it--was rather decent! I wasn't wincing at any part of the movie and appreciated that none of the details were lost. No loose ends, and very tightly directed. I was impressed. I'm no space-time expert, but I felt that how that element was explained was done well enough and most importantly, believable, even if that element might annoy some for any inaccuracies.

6928478,2,B00RDEIRB0,"Started off kind of cool, since I love time related stories.  But then it just seemed to get dumb and dumber. It was so dreary and the characters so uninteresting. I think the problem is the writers started with characters that were not smart or grounded enough to make something interesting happen. It's like you start a story with a turtle as the main character, when it needed to be a stallion. Once the story starts stalling, it's too late to turn your characters into stallions.  Yeah, they were real life type, totally clueless people, but that's not what was needed here. Why would I want to watch one dumb decision after another for an hour and a half?
Couldn't finish it. Let me know what happened.
It was a riff off an old Twilight Zone where a couple went in a diner. At the table was a machine that tells your future for a penny. Eventually the couple can't leave the diner because they might do the wrong thing without the guidance of the fortune teller machine.  There's a reason those old TZ episodes were only 1/2 hour. This screenwriter couldn't support the premise for very long. It just fell in the trash.

6928492,5,B00RDEIRB0,"Let me start off by saying this was a brilliant movie! I would recommend this movie to people that are still into movies with plots and a good story line to them. I don't want to give away the story by just telling you everything that happens in the movie and spoiling the ending for you but I do want to give you enough information so that you can decide for yourself whether to spend your money or not on this movie if it is not free for you to watch.

Let me start off by telling you some things that I observed in the movie. First off the movie starts out slow. I was tempted to stop watching the movie because I thought it was just another typical movie that had already been done before with the random cussing runts by a character in the movie that I have already seen before. But I decided to give the movie a chance because I have known a lot of great movies that started out slow but by the end I was looking for the movie information on the internet so that I could buy a copy to keep for my collection. The first twenty to thirty minutes starts out slow but not that slow that you cannot keep watching the movie. The actors are just getting started and it takes them a minute to warm up to their characters but you can tell they have acting skills which keep you interested in the movie. By the end of the movie you will understand what the producer was doing and just be in awe. You may actually watch the movie and have your mouth open as you piece the beginning of the movie together from start to finish.

I believe that the movie is good and if this is the producer's first movie I really am impressed. That means that the producer's movies will only get better and better with more experience. You can tell that the producer has a true gift that is not given to everybody. I would definitely spend $3.99 to watch this movie if I had to because it is well made and well thought out. Overall, this movie is 5 stars. It may not start out as a 5 star movie and you may be tempted to under-estimate the producer but let me tell you don't do it. Keep watching and stick in there because the by the end of the movie you will understand why you did.",1487289600,,2159,4.113744075829384

Admittedly, the time-travel aspect can be over-used, but this takes a new view on it. Some of the best acclaimed movies were shot on low budgets, like this and other Sundance movies. This is like ""Memento"" in that you have to watch it several times, and think, to truly understand it.

6928521,4,B00RDEIRB0,"It's a really interesting movie, with a great take on time travel. Honestly it's one of the best and most believable uses of time travel I've ever seen in a movie. It's so intriguing though, that I was thinking more about what could be going on than what the movie was actually showing. For example, there could have been a very interesting take where since they see the photo of the future first, and then they believe they have to do everything exactly as it was in the photo. It could actually be that the Time Machine isn't seeing into the future, but instead it's creating the future by showing a possibility the machine wants to occur, a more evil form of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead all they focus on is that they have to do whatever is in the picture or they'll die, something they came up with for no real reason, other than a guess about why their neighbor died. They also avoid the science of the time machine, but I love the idea that essentially only light is traveling in time since it's a camera, something that actually makes a lot of sense, hypothetically. I'd loved for them to discuss the science more, but their only chance is abruptly cut short in a stupid scene. The whole descent into madness is interesting, and it kind of works, but the plot twist at the end doesn't make any sense. A lot of stuff that goes down is stupid, but at least it was set up throughout the movie, but there's no set up for the end. Not only did I hate it, the one character was either insane, a moron, or for some reason they completely forgot how the time machine worked, as they instead wanted to write a note for their past self to change the events of the last day. If that's how the time machine worked, they would have already seen the picture and the day would have already been different, the whole point is that for the observer, time is constantly moving uninterrupted in one direction, and it's only the time machine that can look into the future. Other than that, the biggest weakness of the movie is the acting, it's sub-par, which is disappointing since it's such a small cast. Still, I had a good time watching Time Lapse, so I gave it 4 stars.",1452816000,,2168,4.395522388059701
6928522,4,B00RDEIRB0,"How well do you really know your neighbors? When Callie and Finn's elderly neighbor passes away, they are left to clean out his apartment and what they find is more than a little disturbing. Next to some strange device is a wall with thousands of pictures of them! At first they think the man was just a pervert, until the next day when they realize the machine is a camera that is taking a picture of their apartment, 24 hours into the future. With the help of their friend, Jasper, the couple decides to use the technology to get rich, but it doesn't take long for the local criminal element to realize what's going on, and try to take a piece of it. Most writer/directors don't hit a homerun their first time out, but in this case, with the help of a young up and coming cast, that's exactly what Bradley King did. This film is very engaging and has you on the edge of your seat, combined with an utterly shocking ending, this is the kind of film that you will still be thinking about days later. It's amazing to me that something of this quality was never released in theaters, but it is just as good, if not better than any thing you'll see on the big screen. The one drawback is that it does take a little while to get moving, hence the bad reviews from people who can't give a film more than twenty minutes, but once it gets started, Time Lapse quickly grabs hold and never lets go.

6928545,4,B00RDEIRB0,"Time Lapse is not a time travel movie, there is no time travel at all in the film. It's a movie where a camera takes a picture of what is happening in front of its lens 24 hrs into the future and prints out a polaroid of what is happening.  That lens is pointed at a big window of the living room of a small flat where three young adults live, who aren't the types who bother with curtains, including one who is the apartment manager so has keys to the apartment where the camera is, which is found when the elderly occupant's mail, newspapers and parking tickets start piling up and the manager's girlfriend checks to see if the old man is okay.

The film is low budget and has no big name actors in it at all, in fact I don't recognise any of the cast from being in any movies or TV shows.  They aren't going to win an Oscar for their performance in Time Lapse but they do a pretty decent job.  The script at times maybe could have been better written to be believable such as the obvious why would you keep placing bets with the one bookie, especially when he's a violent type?  Perhaps there are people that stupid but surely the other two flat mates would have foreseen his stupidity and given him some advice. This type of film of course has you asking what would I do in this situation and no doubt you'd make more intelligent decisions but there wouldn't be much of a film is simply everyone just got rich. The film never explains how the camera can see into the future as conveniently the inventor is not alive to need to explain, so that aspect was well done.

Overall though the movie is more than watchable, it's actually quite enjoyable.  Sure there have been other movies, books and TV shows dealing with glimpses into the future, even with a camera but so what? There's been plenty on most subjects films are made of.",1444953600,,1832,4.308139534883721

The low budget is accurate as acting was marginally acceptable; there were only three main actors and about five more with very minor roles. It was filmed in essentially two rooms in a cheap apartment complex. The props consisted of a steam punk recycled metal tubing looking device with Polaroid photos as its raison d'tre. That's it! Except, the story rescued itself as we see our three main characters transformed by greed and distrust brought on by what this device spits out (the photos).
Possible downsides, I would have put in an alternate ending, although this one was acceptable. Also, the number of dumb decisions by our intelligent protagonists are written in to make the story last 90 minutes, but lessens believability.

6928635,5,B00RDEIRB0,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I love movies about time travel, particularly those that try to negate or even preempt the paradoxical issues involved.  Many of the films Ive seen that address this subject are intelligent and clever, however a handful stand out above the rest.  I am proud to add TIME LAPSE to this elite few.  This film is a slick sci-fi thriller that entertains on every level, and I can see myself revisiting this one very soon.  It is simply that good.

I had high expectations for this film, but I wasn't prepared for just how much fun it really is.  The story is engrossing, the acting is superb, and the conceptswow.  They truly boggle the mind.  Im one of those geeky guys who likes to discuss and debate the plausibility of time travel, so if you're a fellow geek, this movie is definitely for you.

TIME LAPSE is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, although I have to confess I have no clue what the films budget was.

The acting is superb, with Danielle Panabaker, Matt OLeary, and George Finn giving excellent performances.  These three have great onscreen chemistry, and they seem to have no trouble bringing their characters to life.  I also enjoyed seeing John Rhys-Davies in a cameo role as Mr. Bezzerides.  He doesnt have much screen-time (barely any at all, except in the Deleted Scenes), but Rhys-Davies always delights, regardless of his role.

The special effects in TIME LAPSE are almost nonexistent, however the machine (camera) looks impressive, much like something of that nature would be expected to appear.  The story is the real winner, though.  This tale is a carefully constructed and well-executed thriller that will keep you riveted until the end.  And theres even a nice twist I didn't see coming, as well.

TIME LAPSE is a major win for me, and science fiction buffs will want to check this out soon.  You don't have to have a high IQ to enjoy this one, either.  It doesnt propose mind-bending physics or dabble too much in the paradoxic issues, but instead offers a curious and yet terrifying glimpse into the what-ifs of the situation.  TIME LAPSE is available tomorrow, and I recommend giving it a look.",1434326400,,2234,4.715762273901809

6928638,5,B00RDEIRB0,"Suppose you could ""time travel,"" but instead of you going to the future, or the past, the future comes to you in the form of a single polaroid snapped 24 hours in the future?

Initially that premise seems too limited to have much potential, but what would the effect of being able to communicate with yourself of 24 hours?  You could tell yourself what bets to place on dog races, what things to avoid, the nasty things your friends intend to do to you, but all that might be subject to misinterpretation. It is, after all, just a polaroid.

And what would happen to free will?

This movie takes the premise of the future polaroid and runs with it.  We are introduced to three roommates, Jasper, Finn and Callie, who discover that their now-dead neighbor has been taking picture of them. They work out that these were future pictures, and then the moral dilemmas ensue.  Should they use the camera for self-gain? Should they tell the authorities about the dead neighbor? What should they do when the local mobster gets suspicious about Jasper's unprecedented winning streak?  Can they even change what they see in the pictures?

The story works as kind of a mystery as the trio attempt to decipher the clues from the pictures.  It is also a morality tale as they become more and more corrupted by this limited form of omniscience. Some of the plot developments were easily spotted by science fiction fans, some of the plot developments were kept will hidden.  The acting was good and the plotting was excellent.

6928649,3,B00RDEIRB0,"Considering its Olive Garden budget, TIME LAPSE manages to execute its intriguing premise with some impressive skill. Unfortunately, significant elements of the script come across as juvenile or half-formed, resulting in a viewing experience that is half-awe and half-scoffs. Or maybe a little more of one than the other.

The story is about apartment manager Finn, a budding artist who shares an apartment with his girlfriend, Callie, and his pill-popping buddy, Jasper. One day, they discover that a tenant has died, leaving behind a camera that can take pictures of the future. Once the friends find the photos and start trying to figure them out, things quickly spiral out of control. Are they causing the pictures to happen, or is it the other way around? Are we in charge of our fate? Which came first: the future or our picture of it?

The bare bones of the story are pretty interesting and worth a good post-film conversation with anyone who's got the patience for time-paradox discussions. The problem is that the film's idea of conflict is pretty adolescent. Although the movie focuses mostly on our three leads (almost aggressively so, including a weirdly-framed shot at a party where every single person is dancing with their backs to the camera except Finn, Callie, and Jasper), it tosses in a violent bookie to amp up the stakes. The problem is that the bookie is not a very threatening guy (I'd lay money that his beard is glued on), and the paranoia and chaos that results from his introduction to the film makes very little sense. A lot of explanations for this might lie in the fact that Jasper is constantly doing drugs, but even this is portrayed in a half-baked way: Jasper carries around a metal case that is filled with a random assortment of pills of all shapes, colors, and sizes, and he ingests them and shares them with others without seeming to distinguish between which pill is which, like they all do the same thing even though they're clearly different. This is like what a prepubescent kid might imagine when they think of a guy who's addicted to pills. It just smacks of laziness and/or ignorance, which is a shame, since the actual plotting of the film clearly took some time and brains.

While the whole film may not add up to the sum of its parts (there's much that's lukewarm, including the acting, set design, and even the title), and while there is a level of immaturity to the film's general idea of reality, the philosophical thrust of the story and the nuts and bolts of its timeline (as well as its small handful of secrets and twists) are pretty satisfying overall. You take what you can get: I enjoyed the film when all was said and done, but I have a hard time recommending it to anyone who doesn't already have a lot of free time on their hands.",1433548800,4,2792,4.682281059063136

Last, you have the pretty girl...but she can't seem to figure out which guy she wants to play ""house"" with. You can learn from watching the trailer, the trio discover by accident.....a machine built by a neighbor, who dies unexpectedly, that shows the future. The classic factors of greed gone rampant come from all characters. What makes the movie a bit different....is that money isn't always the thing a person can be greedy for.

In my experience, the majority of films dealing with these elements get messy and convoluted. This film, however, is consistent and without plot holes. There are great surprises and an awesome twist at the end.

 The actors are great as well. They all have solid performances. Matt O Leary (Finn) and Danielle Panabaker (Callie) were very good, but the best performance was from George Finn (Jasper), who I wasn't familiar with before this film. He played his part perfectly. I'm sure we will be seeing more from him.

I will definitely be purchasing the Blu-Ray for my collection, which is saying something because I only purchase my absolute favorite films for my collection. I am very excited for the special features too, which I read will include deleted scenes and a commentary as well as some ""making of"" featurettes.

6928662,4,B00RDEIRB0,"This low-budget, small cast, seemingly simple film has a simple plot premise: 3 young people discover that a dead scientist in an apartment across from theirs left running a machine capable of taking photographs 24 hours in advance.

The 3 consist of a boyfriend (a would-be painter whose main job is custodian for the building), the girlfriend (who has some random day job), and another male friend living with them whose main job seems to consist of betting on horses and popping pills.

A gambler finding a machine capable of snapping photos 24 hours in advance leads to the obvious next plot developments: using it to front-run bets, and the obvious developments after that: bookies are not fond of bettors who always win.

This simple premise actually leads to an underlying philosophical rumination on causality.  Without adding any further plot spoilers, Ill just observe that what I took out of it was the that if three people participate in the same events, there would be at least four ways to attribute causality (if not a lot more).  The film at least makes you think about it.  There is no nudity beyond bare backs and arms, moderate depiction of violence (mostly blood spatters on people and objects), and a fair amount of swearing including more than the average in F-bombs.  I wasn't familiar with any of the actors before; I thought the acting was competent though not brilliant, the cinematography uses predominantly a dark palette because most of the action is in interiors at night, so your high resolution system will not stand out much compared to an older-format DVDs, the directing was workmanlike, and mainly the script made this film interesting.
