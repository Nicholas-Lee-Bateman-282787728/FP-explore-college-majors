The background music is annoying and doesn't correlate with the motions.

I completely agree with ""A viewer's"" review (e.g. setting sterile but not offensive, and tape is a good supplement to a more rigorous routine)",1161475200,2,391,5.0
7856447,5,6303952712,"Probably not applicable to advanced ballet dancers, but great 'basic but complete' routine, on the floor, for beginner to intermediate dancers. Have recommended it to figure skaters looking for hip-back flexibility for spirals, laybacks and Ena Bauers.",1056412800,,252,5.837837837837838
7856448,4,6303952712,"I have been dancing for two decades now and I find this video SO helpful. It basically revolutionised my turn-out and really helped my arabesque line too. I use it when I am on holidays, even when I am travelling - I have done it so many times now that I can do the series of exercises on my own with some paper notes to remind me of the order so it's perfect for motels especially because you don't need a lot of space. I can do it on the motel bed if necessary!
It is mainly aimed at dancers but even so, a non-dancer or beginner dancer would get a lot out of it as long and he/she took things at their own pace and did not push their body beyond their own personal limits. Nicole says bascially that in the introduction anyway.
My main criticism is I wish there was more abdominal work, but that is coming from someone who has done a lot of Pilates so not everyone may feel that way.
However at the end of the 45 minutes or so, I feel completely worked, and satisfyingly tired. I highly recommend this video.",1014249600,6,1011,4.137055837563452
7856449,5,6303952712,"I've been crazy about dancing since March of 99 and this has been one of my all-time favorite tapes to do at home, to get my body warmed up and feeling in shape. Nicole Vass warms up your body progressively and gradually--and safely. The tape has a section each devoted to warmup, turn-out, stretching, and cool down. I love her voice, her look, and her personality. No matter how many times I have used this tape, I don't tire of it--unlike most of the arobics tapes. :) So, congrats, Nicole, and thanks!!",993859200,7,506,4.510869565217392
