8033170,1,B0002VI4BO,Read the three reviews. Made my purchase. Was completely disappointed. Spend your money on the book by Daniel Goleman entitled SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE. This DVD is like a very bad meal in a five star Paris restaurant. Everyone says you are going to enjoy it because of the five stars... But you have been had once you get the check and find out no hooker came with it.,1129161600,7,364,4.447761194029851
8033171,5,B0002VI4BO,I bought this video after seeing it receive a top-notch endorsement by Training Media Review. Groups have really enjoyed the film and learned a lot from it. It's far from the boring training films you often find. The Hollywood content makes the applied examples compelling.,1103932800,12,273,5.088888888888889
8033172,5,B0002VI4BO,"So glad I came across this video. A really great introduction to emotional intelligence, and the activities that come with it make great companions. Everything from a Leader Guide, Powerpoint, even foam brains to pass out to participants. Excellent!",1098230400,11,249,5.410256410256411
