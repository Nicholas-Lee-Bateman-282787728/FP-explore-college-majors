6069794,5,B00GB0OTNM,"""Veggies in Space: The Fennel Frontier"" is another wonderful Veggie-parody of popular media in a long line of other Veggie videos (including ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ballad-of-Little-Joe/dp/B0002TSY8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ballad of Little Joe</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-A-Meaningful-Life/dp/B0045XKAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's A Meaningful Life</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-Wizard-of-Ha-s/dp/B000TUDFE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's</a>"", and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Beans/dp/B003MUW7Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Beans</a>"").  This time we have the return of the USS Applepies (first seen in 1995's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-My-Neighbor/dp/B000FJOFLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You My Neighbor?</a>""), but with even more overt references to Star Trek as Bob and Larry are now in the roles of Captain Cuke and his first officer, Mr. Spork.

In the video,  Capt Cuke, Mr. Spork and the rest of the crew of the USS Applepies are sent on a mission to stop the evil space pirate, Luntar the Looter (protrayed by Mr. Lunt).  However, Cuke & Spork, posing undercover as ""Tootany"" tourists, find that Luntar is himself a victim, desperately trying to save his planet from solar burst popcorn meteorites.  When Luntar's nephew decides to share his lunch with the captured Applepies crew, he gives Capt Cuke the idea that the Galactic Law of Finder's Keepers may not be all its cracked up to be.  The video's theme is the power of sharing.",1389916800,9,1768,7.558252427184466
6069795,5,B00GB0OTNM,My daughter loves the veggie tales shows. This happens to be one of her favorites. I only wish the creators had kept control of the franchise instead of selling it. The new ones aren't the same.,1462924800,,194,4.416666666666667
6069796,5,B00GB0OTNM,"One of the best Veggie Tale Movies ever.  Five Adults (ages 21+) laughed at the multiple references from various classic TV shows and Movies.  Star Trek, Star Wars, Dr Who and 2001 a Space Odyssey are only some of the inspirational references we identified.

6069806,5,B00GB0OTNM,"Its been quite a few years since we have Veggies in space, so when I saw the newest episode in the long running VeggieTales series would be Veggies in Space: The Fennel Frontier, I was excited.  I was hoping it would prove plenty of laughs, and it did.

As the episode opens, Larry the Cucumber is hanging from a rope over the countertop.  Despite his requests for help getting down or getting warm or getting something to eat, all his friends aren't willing to share what they have with him.  That reminds Bob the Tomato of an e-mail asking about sharing, and it sends us off to space.

We join the crew of the USS Applepie as they get involved in a dispute over some newly discovered mewantium.  But thats just a precursor (I suspect really a time filler) to the main story in which Captain Cuke (Larry) and his first mate Mr. Spork (Bob) set off to discover why the planet Fennel is stealing all power from anything that comes close to it.  When they arrive, they find that the planet is not the resort community it once was and it appears that it's ruler, Luntar the Looter (Mr. Lunt) has turned into a space pirate.  Why is he stealing all the power?  And can sharing really help solve the problem?

Its been a while since there was an episode that had humor clearly geared for the parents in the audience.  Dont misunderstand, the video is still completely clean and appropriate for all ages.  But being a scifi spoof (Star Trek most prominently, but there are plenty of other references), there are spoof jokes that the kids won't get but will crack up their parents.  I know I was laughing at quite a bit of the show.

At times, the lessons in these shorts can be pretty heavy handed these days.  While it is obvious here that sharing is good, it is worked into the show in such a way that I didn't feel preached at.  And there is certainly nothing wrong with teaching kids that sharing is a good thing.

The new silly song is Asteroid Cowboys, with original verses and a chorus inspired by Home on the Range.  Its pretty amusing if not quite a silly song classic.

All told, Veggies in Space: The Fennel Frontier is a great addition to the VeggieTales series.  Youll laugh and be reminded that God wants us to share.",1434412800,,2225,4.4068627450980395
