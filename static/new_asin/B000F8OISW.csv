2555026,5,B000F8OISW,I've really enjoyed watching the DVD.  This show was always a hoot. This brings back great memories and still makes me laugh.  I wish someone would air an H. R. Puffinstuf marathon just once!,1362182400,,191,4.588235294117647
2555027,5,B000F8OISW,"The Bugaloos was an American children's television series, sortof the British version of the Monkees, produced by brothers Sidney Krofft and Martin Krofft, airing on NBC on Saturday mornings from 1970 to 1972. The show featured a musical group composed of four British-accented teenagers, who lived in fictional Tranquility Forest. They wore insect-themed outfits (Wayne Laryea / Harmony (a bumblebee) / keyboards, John Philpott / Courage (a ladybug) / drums, Caroline Ellis / Joy (a butterfly) / percussion, lead and backup vocals, and John McIndoe / I.Q. (a grasshopper) / guitars and lead vocals) with antennae and wings which allowed them to fly, though, on occasion they were shown flying on surfboards, and were constantly beset by the evil machinations of Benita Bizarre (played by Martha Raye)who, being untalented and ugly herself, was covetous of the Bugaloos' musical prowess. enita was aided by two bumbling henchmen, the anthropomorphic speakers Woofer and Tweeter (Joy Campbell and Van Snowden), and her chauffeur and chief flunky, the German-accented Funky Rat (Sharon Baird). She frequently made use of a powerful ultrasonic weapon called the Stereo Zapper, which could render its victim unconscious in seconds. This DVD collection was produced by by Rhino Entertainment in May 2006. The set contains all seventeen episodes, with audio commentary on the pilot episode from creator Sid Krofft and director Tony Charmoli. Cast members John Philpott, Caroline Ellis, and John McIndoe also provided audio commentary on some episodes and participated in interviews. Also included were a video jukebox with a selection of songs from the episodes, a photo gallery, and a Bugaloos Interactive I. Q. Test, hosted by John ""I. Q."" McIndoe. I recommend this DVD series for all those who want to relive yesteryear. Excellent stories, cast, and music..... 1970's here I come!",1359504000,,1877,5.366101694915254

Don't get me wrong, today's shows are great but it is nice to appreciate how corny we were in '71. Thank you to whoever made this bonding experience for a dad and his daughter possible.

2555033,5,B000F8OISW,"I love the Bugaloos.  Have ever since I was 6 years old in 1970, and I will love them until I die.  Sounds stupid and mawkish, but I am not kidding.  Oh, for a pair of pink wings and to be surrounded by hot young British dudes...I never could make up my mind if I liked IQ or Courage best.  We got everything with this magical show.  Great songs, good moral lessons, trippy psychedelic influenced sets, and the power to believe anything could happen so long as you knew Tranquility Forest existed.  In short, and at the very essence of this thing, welcome to your childhood.  This is the best place you could ever come!  Nobody appreciates this box set more than yours truly.  Pass it on.  You will make somebody else smile when they're in need of friends indeed.",1290211200,,763,4.385714285714286
2555034,5,B000F8OISW,"""The Bugaloos"" was the second series for television created by the great innovative minds of brothers Sid and Marty Krofft.  They come from a talented family of puppeteers that go back five generations.  Many years of creative shows Sid and Marty have done include putting on neighborhood puppet shows, and later did carnival shows on the road.  The Krofft brothers got their first TV break when Dean Martin hired them to do various puppet sketches on his weekly NBC-TV show.  NBC would give them their next big break when Hanna-Barbera Productions asked Sid and Marty to design the costumes for the network's new live action Saturday morning show, ""The Banana Splits Adventure Hour"".  It was a big hit for NBC, and that helped pave the way for Sid and Marty Krofft's first TV production series again on NBC, ""H.R. Pufnstuf"".  ""The Bugaloos"" was their follow-up show that also premired on NBC a year after ""H.R. Pufnstuf"".  The series stared four British cast members, Carolyn Ellis, John Philpott, John McIndoe, and Wayne Laryea as four musical insects living happily in Tranquility Forest.  Other cast members include Billy Barty as Sparky the firefly, former ""Mickey Mouse Club"" mouseketeer Sharon Baird as Funky Rat, and the funny talented Martha Raye as Benita Bizarre who tries in vain to wreck havoc on the Bugaloos.  If you miss the innocent days of Saturday morning television like I do when there were no news programs to distract you, this is fun show to check out, and it takes you back forty years when Saturday morning was a fun place to temporarilly forget your troubles.  Believe me.  You'll enjoy it!",1287014400,,1617,4.886446886446887
2555035,5,B000F8OISW,"I remember watching these shows when I was a child and loving them.  I purchased this item hoping that my children would enjoy them too, and they do.

2555037,5,B000F8OISW,"I was being born when this first aired in 1970, so I didn't know about this until after I saw all the the other Krofft shows when I was a kid,. So it was about Land of the Lost  ,and Lidsville for me , until 1978-1979, when they aired Krofft superstars in the after noon, I was 8 going on 9. So that is when I first saw the Bugaloos , and when I first saw her, the first T.V. girl I ever fell in love with ,who can that be you say?. A beautiful english Bugaloo with a pretty smile, and a hell of a set of legs(lol) who's went by the name of Joy. (aka Caroline Ellis)I loved listening to them sing and when I watch her perform  , hearts of love would pop and circle around my head like you would see in cartoons. Then the years went by, and I forgot about her , until one night in 1995, when Nick at Nite was pufapolooza from 6 pm until 5 am, the I saw her again the lost love (fantasy wise that is)and at the age of 25 I still looked at her like I did when I was a kid. Now I finally have this collection, of great songs , fond memories , and of course Joy. You will never have show like this ever and Krofft were the kings of Saturday Mornings in the 70's. Definitly reminds me if a time of innocence an I still enjoy listening and singing these songs, to Caroline even now you are older ,you still have that beauty, and it is weird now when I think about it and how they all have grown old and so have I (39). But that youthful spirit will always be fresh and timelesss when I watch this over and over again. It still brings a smile to my face, but yet it makes me sad how those youthful days have gone.",1241222400,,1605,3.860606060606061

My kids, however, were not nearly as entertained as I was. I made them watch it to get them back for all the years of Barney and Teletubbies to which I was subjected!  If you watched this show as a kid, H.R. Puffnstuff is still your friend when things get rough! ;-)",1224806400,,423,4.197530864197531

2555045,5,B000F8OISW,"I purchased this item trying to find something different for my two nieces, aged 4 and 10. They really love it, the four year old watches Bugaloos everyday after pre-school. It is amazing how well Sid and Marty Kroft hold up after 35-40 years. They also really enjoy H R Puff-n-Stuff as well.",1200787200,,292,4.528301886792453
2555046,5,B000F8OISW,I remember watching the Bugaloos afterschool on PBS and really want my sons to watch the shows I did.  The DVD is bringing me back to those times and love watching my sons watch the show like I used to.  It is awesome and so glad I purchased the DVD.,1193443200,,250,3.98
2555047,5,B000F8OISW,"I loved this show when I was a little girl.  I have many happy memories.  How I enjoyed dancing in front of my mirror with my hair brush microphone, pretending that I was Joy, the pink Bugaloo! (admit it, if you were a girl, I bet you did that too!)  If you enjoyed this as a child, you really should get it and share it with your own children or dare I say grandchildren.  Saturday mornings use to be so special.  Now with cable and 24 hour cartoon channels, video games and such, it is nice to have something to remember our childhoods by. Those of us raised in the 70's were given a much more innocent view of the world, one that our young minds could grasp.  The Bugaloos were a part of that, as were all of the Sid and Marty Kroft shows.",1175299200,,742,4.082758620689655
2555048,5,B000F8OISW,I loved watching this program when I was little - these DVDs are crystal clear and so colorful it seems more vibrant than I remember.  My two little ones ages 4 and 2 love it too!,1169078400,,179,3.9722222222222223

2555050,5,B000F8OISW,"This was one of my favorite shows as a kid, along with all of the other Sid and Marty Kroft shows.  I had some old VHS tapes with one of these episodes on it, and my 3 year old daughter watched it and loved it, so I had to buy this.  I enjoy watching the show as it brings back lots of memories of my childhood, and to have my daughter enjoy it now too is just a priceless thing.",1168300800,,379,3.725
2555051,5,B000F8OISW,Well I remember all of those shows in the 70 I was trying to find something like that I have been looking for this type of DVD that shows all of my great shows that I remember. It is great I will recomend this one to anyone that remember all of those good all shows in the 70 they will enjoyed this product.,1161993600,,307,3.888888888888889
2555052,5,B000F8OISW,"If you remember this show as a kid and never got it out of your mind after all these years, you just have to get it.  Not only is it a wonderful trip down memory lane, but introducing little relatives to Tranquility Forest will also be a pleasure for you as you watch a new generation learn important lessons like being able to do anything if you set your mind to it and learning the value of true friends.

I missed this short-lived series for so many years after the rare reruns on UHF and TVLand, so this DVD set is a genuine treasure for both myself and anyone else who ever loved this great cleancut show.  All 17 episodes are here in blaringly irresistible color, right along with the great songs and the four English teenage bugs who won our hearts as children.  My favorite episode is Benita's Double Trouble, in which IQ dresses up as Benita Bizaare in an attempt to rescue Peter Platter, and does a great impersonation of her.  I always had a crush on ""Big John"" so maybe I'm prejudiced, but Little John Philpot (Courage) was no slouch either, and I always wanted to be Joy (Caroline Ellis).  This was one of Sid and Marty Krofft's best Saturday morning shows; magical, colorful, imaginative, and full of great music, it's a shame there weren't more episodes.  Still, we have to be grateful for what we got.  Let's also give credit to our great villain, the late Martha Raye whose outfits and makeup alone were just a trip in themselves, and Billy Barty who played the cute little neurotic Sparky Firefly.

There are some really great extras in this box set as well, including interviews with Big John, Little John, and Caroline Ellis, as well as a trivia game, a video jukebox, and commentary on some of the episodes.  Unfortunately Wayne Laryea (Harmony) is not included in any of these, which is surprising since he and Caroline are still quite close.  For more on the Bugaloos, check out the Tranquility Forest website.  It is closed down right now, but you can still view all the great stuff on it, and maybe create enough interest to get the webmaster roused into action again.",1158710400,,2093,4.552
2555053,3,B000F8OISW,"It's amazing how much children's television has improved over the years.  This was one of my favorite shows growing up so it was definitely a trip down memory lane.  I actually bought this for my children to watch since I had such great memories of the show.  But times have really changed!  Witchypoo yells out, ""you stupid idiot"" and other such stuff.  For adults who want to see an old favorite again, this video might be worth buying.  But even I was kind of disappointed.  Watching it again kind of ruined a good memory.  The characters are dated and make Barney's costume look futuristic!  The language seems inappropriate for kids of many ages.",1157846400,,651,4.6902654867256635
2555054,5,B000F8OISW,I remember this show growing up.  Excellent clean entertainment.  You don't get this quality now in my opinion.,1151712000,,111,5.111111111111111
2555055,5,B000F8OISW,"Man, does this take me back! The Bugaloos, a creation of Sid & Marty Krofft, are 4 teenage musical bugs who live in a surreal, psychedelic place called Tranquility Forest (along with their friend Sparky the Firefly) and are always prepared to fly to the aid of a friend in trouble.

I.Q., Harmony, Courage and (my favorite) Joy always seem to be at odds with the evil (but hilarious) Benita Bizarre, whose main goal is to become a famous rock singer. Benita stops at nothing to achieve fame, from kidnapping the Bugaloos to stealing their voices and even their wings! Though she and her flunkies bungle through every attempt, the Bugaloos always find a way to foil her plans.

With every episode, the Bugaloos treat you to a musical performance (a la Partridge Family style). With dreamy vocal harmonies and catchy pop/rock hooks, songs like ""The Senses Of Our World"", ""I'm As Happy As Can Be"" and ""It's New To You"" don't miss. These songs and more can be found on the Bugaloos Video Jukebox featured in this DVD set.

All 17 episodes of this show were restored brilliantly by Rhino. I haven't seen the Bugaloos since my VERY early childhood so this DVD set is a rare find a real treat! I can enjoy them now as I did when I was a kid.",1151625600,,1234,4.475555555555555
2555056,5,B000F8OISW,"Long have I wished for a return to my past.  This is about as close as I can get so far.  I have loved the Bugaloos and their music since I was a child.  Seeing them again has brought back many fond memories. The DVD's are incredible. The songs have been in my head since I heared them the first time, and now I can hear and feel them again. I would like to know if there is any way I can e-mail long overdue fanmail.

2555057,5,B000F8OISW,"It was fun watching the series and remembering times as a child, when I'd sit glued to the telvision set singing the entry song, laughing at Benita Bizarre, and thinking, ""being bad simply doesn't pay!"" Poor Benita, try as she might, she could never get things right. Her energy would've been better served had she taken singing and music lessons, and stopped trying to steal the talents of The Bugaloos. But then, if she'd done that, we wouldn't have had a wonderful family show to enjoy!",1149292800,,489,4.6976744186046515
2555058,5,B000F8OISW,"I discoverd the Kroffts and their wacky brand of TV, a few years ago on TV Land. I had always heard about it from a friend back east, when I was in high school.

It all began with Pufnstuf, when I saw it. I didn't know what to think, it was quite unlike anything I had seen on TV. But a few years past, and eventually Pufnstuf came out on DVD.

I was amazed how well made these shows were, and this was true psychadelia. The Kroffts took you to lands where trees talked, hats walked, and sea monsters lived with boys. So, when I heard the Bugaloos was coming to DVD, I was over joyed.

The Bugaloos is about 4 teenage bugs that live in the forest. The show itself, has a very fantastical asthetic to it that is missing in many of the ""head"" aspects of our culture today. This is the live action equivilent of ""The Beatles: Yellow Submarine"". But the appeal goes way beyond there, the main villain in the show is Benita Bizzare(Martha Raye) who resembles a drag queen.

But I certainly recommend this show, for any fans of Head films...Psychadelia...Or just wants to remember simpler times before technology killed magic.

If you like this show, I also recommend picking up the rest of the Krofft catalog.",1149206400,,1204,4.405405405405405

2555060,5,B000F8OISW,"Growing up in the 70's meant a lot of things.  And being that Saturday morning cartoons were a big part of any kid's life, back then, you have to tip your hat to Sid & Marty Krofft.  The Krofft SuperPower Hour With Elelctra Woman & Dynagirl was the epiphany of 70's childrens shows.  Sure, PBS had their share with The Electric Company and Sesame Street and The New Zoo Review and Zoom, the Krofft bros. were the kings.  They inundated us with a plethora of cool shows:  Land Of The Lost, Sigmund, H.R. Puff'n'stuff, The Ghost Busters (with Larry Storch), Lidsville, Far Out Space Nuts . . . the list goes on.  Now that we are adults, the fondness of our memories often paints these classics in angelic light, until we see them again.  (Ever try to sit through an episode of The Love Boat now?  What were we thinking?)  I've got the First Season of The Land Of The Lost, and my kids love it.  I sit and watch it with them and I giggle at the cheesy special effects and the overuse of Chroma-key and the particularly bad 70's acting, and still the nostalgia wins me over.  These shows are great!  Take them for what they are and no more: a humerous, genuine look back into your 70's childhood.  Great!  Sid and Marty rock! (Now I'm still trying to figure out The Dukes Of Hazzard???  And where the hell is Fantasy Island?)",1112918400,,1321,4.35655737704918
2555061,3,B000F8OISW,"As a child of the 70's, I was in heaven when I first heard about this box set.  Armed with a bowl of Lucky Charms, I sat down and watched the WHOLE set in one sitting!  The Kroft experience was as fun and trippy as I remember...must admit that the Richard Pryor show seems a little bit out of context with the others.

BIG CAVEAT for those who appreciate bang for the buck.  The box set lists running time of 390 minutes, but note that this is a gross exaggeration.  It is more likely HALF that time.",1107561600,,500,4.11340206185567
2555062,3,B000F8OISW,"If you are going to release a sample collection of the shows created by Sid and Marty Krofft, and you're only going to release a single episode per show, then I would hope that the shows chosen are among the best examples of what the the Krofft philosophy is about, or the most entertaining, or the most representative of the day, or maybe the first episode of the series.

But, somehow none of that is true for this collection of programs, a rare miss from the people at Rhino. There is not a single first episode in this group of 13 shows, and many of them are not even the average of the bunch, let alone the best.

Still, if you are in desperate need of a Wonderbug fix or need to see Lidsville right away, this will do the trick. Hopefully, like with other Krofft titles: H.R. Pufnstuf and Land Of The Lost, all episodes of all series will appear on DVD. For now, this will have to do.",1106697600,,890,4.229411764705882
2555063,4,B000F8OISW,"This could have been better, had they chosen to include only the pilot episodes of each...I suppose they saved those for the DVD compilations of each individual show that have also been released on DVD.  However, this isn't bad, and it's a very nice little boxed set.

I did notice one problem with the Bugaloos episode:  The audio of the speach only comes out of the left speaker!  I thought perhaps there was something wrong with my speaker wire, but I noticed that ambient sounds were coming out of the left speaker and the other programs seemed fine.

There is a lot of garbage on here that should be mentioned.  These include the Richard Pryor show (Pryor's Place), which I guess won Emmys, but the show was aired LONG after the heydey of shows such as Land of the Lost, Lidsville, HR Pufnstuff, etc.  It looks more like Sesame Street than a S&M Krofft creation.  Bigfoot and Wildboy is also pretty weak.

So, it really is a hit-or-miss experience...much is hard to sit through, but the gems shine.  I was pleased to see my favorite episode of Land of the Lost (Skylons)--it's the episode I remember best from those Saturday mornings SO long ago.  And it's a hoot to see Martha Raye and Charles Nelson Reilly vamp it up in their respective episodes (Bugaloos/Lidsville).",1080604800,,1275,4.647321428571429

Alot of it I remembered, and it was fun getting reaquainted with the things I did not remember!  My 10 year old likes it, but my 7 year old actully loves it!  She has watched it over and over, and already knows all the songs!  Which we now all sing on the way to school!  Thank you for offering this classic on DVD, because every Saturday, I get to relive a little bit of my childhood, and have gotten the opportunity to ""show"" my girls, instead of telling them, what Mommy watched when she was little.",1075852800,,748,4.159722222222222
2555065,4,B000F8OISW,"This is a set of one each of the Sid and Marty Krofft that populated Saturday morning TV in the seventies. The shows range in quality from funny and campy (H.R. Pufnstuf, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters), to the hallucinogenically bizarre (Lidsville), to the unwatchable (Bigfoot and Wildboy.) There is definitely something here for everyone to love and hate.
I like the idea of one package with representative shows from the Krofft genre; I just wish they had in some cases picked better examples of their works. In particular, I would have expected a 'Land of the Lost' with a large presence of Sleestak and Pakunis. I don't actually recall 'Bigfoot and Wildboy' from my childhood; I sure hope the example provided isn't representative. If it is, it is easily the worst Krofft show of all time (don't miss the worst bat puppet on a string in film history.)
I am not sure what the popularity of these shows said about our national culture of 30 years ago. I personally don't believe that it was a method of emotionally escaping from the horror of Vietnam, which some academics have (no kidding) suggested (come on we were kids, we had no clue about Vietnam.) I think the appeal of these shows was just strange and enchanting (for a child) little situations and stories that amused kids. Obviously when I watch these now as an adult their cheesiness entertains, but the plots are pretty tired. Nonetheless, as with any childhood relic, they are fun to revisit (in small doses) periodically.",1073779200,,1487,4.767441860465116
2555066,3,B000F8OISW,"I enjoy most Sid and Marty Krofft shows, so when I saw this I knew i had to have. When i recieved it, I popped the first disc in. Most of the shows here are good. But when I put disc two in I was to some exent dissapointed. Far Out space Nuts was one of my favorite shows, but this episode moves as slow as molasses in an igloo. The Lost Saucer also moves too slow and isn't to terribly funny either. Then the third disc. These were very cheesy, but at the same time enjoyable, with the exception of Bigfoot and Wildboy. I don't know why Every-body complains about Pryors Place. It was to some extent funny and taught a good lesson. But over-all Rhino could have done a better job.",1068336000,,681,4.12781954887218
2555067,3,B000F8OISW,"I am a kid from the 1970's who has many fond memories of the Saturday morning lineup's of SID and Marty KROFFT SUPER HOUR shows.  I loved them so much that even as I hit my mid thirty's I still day dream about certain episodes of Land of the Lost and even  (giggle) the Bugaloo's!  And who could forget Doctor Shrinker?!?! In fact when I saw this hit's pack I was so excited to get it.  Well, I got it for a gift and let me tell you I wasn't impressed as much as I thought I would have been.  Tell me something.. Are George Lucas and Sid and Merty from the same family? I thought that for the cost of this collection, you would have more than one episode of each show! And whats up with Sid and Marty not releasing who season series set's of the shows like Land of the Lost and Bugaloo's on DVD? Kinda like George Lucas not releasing STAR WARS on DVD until 2006! Come on SID and MARTY!!! Don't treat your fans like this! Give us whole season DVD sets to quench our thirst for your awsome shows, and heck make you even more $$$Money$$!!!!  I liked the disc set except for some of the episode choices for each show. And for $40.00 you should get more than 13 indivual shows (some that shouldn't be on there like Pryors Place or Big foot and Wild boy) Give us our shows guy's!!! WE want our series all on DVD!!!",1066003200,,1308,4.109803921568627
2555068,4,B000F8OISW,"""H.R. Pufnstuf! Who's your friend when things get rough? H.R. Pufnstuf! Doesn't do a little 'cause he can't do enough!"" I've been missing my friend for close to 25 years now and it's great to have him back. Oddly enough, the show is both better and worse than I remember it - but mostly better.
First of all, the opening theme is priceless! In my book, it's one of the top five Saturday Morning TV theme songs. The soulful reprise by The Boyds at show's end is also great. (Move over Aretha!)
When I was just a tyke my favorite aspect of the show was, of course, the life-sized puppets - especially H.R. himself. I still like him, but the good ol' boy accent and (*gasp*) go-go boots are just a wee disconcerting - but I'll forgive him. However, I could never stand that dumb magic flute, Freddy, and he's even more bothersome now. (And honestly, what's so magical about him!?) The side characters are mostly charming, like Cling and Clang, but also really weird, like that pink piece of candy that talks with a New York accent. And what's the deal with that glitter-encrusted Cabaret frog? What a freak.
Looking at the show today, I'd have to say what really held it together were, not so much the life-sized puppets, but the two human characters: Jimmy and Witchiepoo. I can't say enough about Jack Wild, who plays Jimmy. He radiates talent all over the place, and that Cockney accent can out-charm even the most enchanting of puppets. He's also got these crazy twist-about, stutter-step dance moves that are so cool they ought to be patented. And then there's Billie Hayes who plays Witchiepoo - she's an absolute riot! It's about as over-the-top as a performance can get, but in this venue, it's perfect and hysterical. What would the show be without Witchiepoo? Not a thing!
If you grew up watching the show, and if you can appreciate good camp, ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" is definitely worth watching again. Sid and Marty Krofft were working on a tight budget, and that's obvious, but they were able to pull off magic with what they had. Not only was it great television, but also the show was highly influential. Will today's children like it? I can't say, but I would assume so.
As far as the DVD itself is concerned, Rhino did an uncharacteristically poor job. The shows look and sound good, which is the main thing, but the navigation is dreadful; finding your way around is a chore. The interview with an adult Jack Wild is simply audio dubbed over a series of (creepy) photographs. (He hasn't aged well.) The sing-a-longs are a nice addition, but I would've liked to see more. The episodes are good, but randomly selected. I would be more than happy to add ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" to my DVD collection, but I'm going to wait for a better release, hopefully a box set with all 17 episodes. I guess I'm hooked again!",1061942400,,2807,4.5936254980079685

2555070,4,B000F8OISW,"When I saw this collection I knew I had to get it.  I grew up watching the Sid & Marty Kroft shows.  Liddsville was always my favorite, but the others were also fun.  As I started watching these episodes again I remembered how much fun they were.
I would suggest anyone who enjoyed these shows the first time around go ahead and get them (remember it is one episode of each show).  If you have not seen these shows since you were a child you may be surprised at how cheesy the sets were, but they are still fun.",1021334400,,511,4.1313131313131315
2555071,5,B000F8OISW,"The world of Living Island, including Witchie Poo and H. R. Pufnstuf is arguably the best effort from the Krofft team.  The look and feel of the show is engaging to all ages, the voice talent is second to none, and the characters are loveable (and laughable - even the villain).  I loved this show as a kid and still love it as an adult.  It was great watching this DVD with my two young sons!
The transfer to DVD is great and these episodes are wonderful representations of the series.  The interview with Jack Wild has good content, but not as engaging thanks to the ""slide show effect"" of him speaking.
This is definately a series that NEEDS to be released in total on DVD and, at the very least, the Pufnstuf movie needs to be available!",1019260800,,741,4.3478260869565215

2555073,4,B000F8OISW,This DVD is great!  It has a sampling of every KROFFT show from the seventies.  The ones from SATURDAY MORNING at least.  I still love LAND OF THE LOST and LIDSVILLE.  LOST SAUCER I found really boring.  Otherwise they are all pretty much as I remember them.,1014768000,,258,4.404255319148936
2555074,4,B000F8OISW,"""The World of Sid and Marty Krofft"" is a three-tape compilation of classic Saturday morning kids' television. The three tapes contain one episode each from 13 different Krofft series. For the most part, these programs were produced and initially aired in the 1970s. The collection as a whole is a wild mix of fantasy, science fiction, puppetry, and comedy.
Many of these shows still hold up remarkable well after all these years. ""H.R. Pufnstuf,"" the fantasy about a human boy marooned on a magical island, is loaded with bizarre puppets and surreal, hallucinogenic imagery. Young ""Pufnstuf"" star Jack Wild has a fun song-and-dance number in this episode. ""Sigmund and the Sea Monsters"" features one of kid TV's most lovable characters in Sigmund, the tentacled sea creature who befriends human boys Johnny and Scott. Also fun is ""The Lost Saucer,"" a sci-fi comedy that is greatly energized by the comic chemistry of stars Ruth Buzzi and Jim Neighbors; the two play friendly androids. ""Saucer"" also features some fun visual touches, such as the Chickaphant (a huge mutant chicken/elephant hybrid).
But the best of the Krofft shows is probably ""Land of the Lost,"" a remarkable attempt to combine serious family drama and science fiction in a children's show. The LOTL episode in this set, ""Skylons,"" revolves around the mysterious alien technology which the Marshall family finds in their strange home.
Other shows represented on the set are the musical fantasy ""Bugaloos""; the trippy ""Lidsville,"" featuring a cast of talking hats; ""Dr. Shrinker,"" a sci-fi comedy about a mad scientist with a shrinking ray; ""Wonderbug,"" a fantasy about a flying car; ""Magic Mongo,"" about a genie and his young pals; and ""Pryor's Place,"" a ""Sesame Street""-like show featuring comedian Richard Pryor.
Not all of the shows hold up as well. The episode of ""Far Out Space Nuts,"" a silly sci-fi comedy, is painfully slow moving. I have fond memories of ""Bigfoot and Wildboy,"" the series about a young man raised by the legendary hairy creature of the American wilderness. But the selected episode, featuring a cheesy female vampire, plays like an Ed Wood film. And the superhero series ""Electra-Woman and Dynagirl"" fails to achieve the tricky balance of camp and excitement attained by the 60s ""Batman"" series (after which the Krofft show appears to be modeled). The ""Electra-Woman"" villain in this episode, The Pharaoh, seems like a rip-off of Batman's King Tut.
Overall, ""The World of Sid and Marty Krofft"" is great fun, and even the less-than-effective shows still bring back great memories.",1003276800,,2571,5.123809523809523
2555075,5,B000F8OISW,"I would definately recomend this video collection to anyone who grew up in the 70's, how fun it was to see the shows I watched when everything was so much simpler! It brought back all the memories of being glued to the TV on Saturdays, waiting with anticipation to see Jimmy on H R Pufnstuf, and watch Sigmund and the Sea Monsters! And of course, what would happen to Will and Holly on Land of the Lost? Would those Sleazestaks finally get them? It's such a blast from the past. I share them with my five-year old now, and he loves them. The funny thing is, once I started watching the videos, I remembered all the songs and characters which I was sure I had forgotten! My son now sings the songs with me, and he likes these shows so much we do a Saturday morning routine just like when I was young, just sitting in front of the TV and wearing our PJ'S eating cereal.

Well, those times are BACK!  Discover the original psychedelic children's show that was so well loved  that McDonald's stole the backgrounds, characters, even the artists from H.  R. Pufnstuf to create their ""McDonaldland"" (ever notice how similar Mayor  McCheese is to Pufnstuf?  Oh, wait... but he's a Burger, not a dragon...  nevermind the sash, and voice...After the Kroftt brothers won their lawsuit,  you saw very little of McDonaldland in commercials)
But my main reason  for purchasing H.R. Pufnstuf was to expose my second grader to the  wonderful world of Living Island, and spark his imagination the same way my  imagination was sparked 31 years ago.",968371200,,843,5.110294117647059

We had the best TV shows back then. Who remembers  waking up on those early Saturday mornings, with a bowl of sugar coated  cereal in one hand, and a blanket,( still in you pjs) in the other, and  sitting right in front of the TV to start watching all those great  cartoons, and  all those great Sid and Marty Krofft shows. Those days are  unfortunatly long gone, all but memories, but you can still relive them.  Just buy this H.R. Puff DVD. All the magic, creativity, and fun is here.  Witchie-Poo, Jimmy, Puff, and the rest of the gang. I recommend this DVD,  an also all the rest of the Krofft stuff, like Land Of The Lost, and  Sigmund and the Seamonsters, which are all on DVD. I will buy all of them  whan they come out. You owe it to yourself, and your kids(if you have them)  to get this DVD and the others, and to show them  what real Saturday  morning tv was and is.

My father was six years old when this first aired on television and he had a huge crush on Caroline Ellis who played Joy, 23 years after this aired I was born and I got hooked on The Bugaloos when I was eleven years old and I was watching some lidsville videos on youtube (2005 by the way) when I came across The Bugaloos hit song For A Friend. I typed in the The Bugaloos on google and the rest is history. I found Bill Ung's wonderful website http://www.bugaloos.com which is still online to this day

10 years later I still love this show, The characters are funny, I like Martha Raye as Benita Bizarre. Sparky the Firefly was about the only character on this show who I could relate to! The special features are cool, there are commentaries with the cast, interviews and a photo gallery as well as a IQ Bugaloo quiz which I think is extremely funny.
