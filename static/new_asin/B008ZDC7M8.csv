5198059,1,B008ZDC7M8,I was unable to watch more than one episode because of Mark Cousin's narration. I don't know why he was allowed by his producers to be the narrator. This seems to be a very interesting documentary RUINED by the most aggravating voice since Diane Rehm. UNWATCHABLE,1357171200,20,263,4.739130434782608
5198060,2,B008ZDC7M8,"I was into the first disc, because there were intriguing images and details of film pioneers and historical setting I'd read about but never seen before.  The downside gradually took over, because Mr. Cousins reflexively serves offerings to the altar of sermonizing opinions.  I don't care about his saying that our pedestrian notion of Hollywood's primacy is ""racist by omission"" (of other cultural advances to the art). It's so patronizing.  just move on and SHOW us those contributions... i'm all eyes and ears and I can figure it out myself.  He begrudges Hollywood with every turn, after he extols the innovations that went on there... Even though artists came from all over Europe to participate in the Hollywwod system.  there's a strain of jealousy extant in these themes and its tiresome.  I've had professors who exploit their captive audience to editorialize matters of creative subjectivity and there's a butt load of that here.  I'd love to see a condensed non self-serving version of this epic series without the meandering style.",1356998400,34,1044,5.105882352941176
5198061,5,B008ZDC7M8,"May 8, 2102:  Since the time I originally posted some comments on this superb documentary essay, ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey,"" I have re-watched all 15 hours of it twice. Several of my friends are cinephiles and college film professors who have been anxious to share this viewing experience with me. This explains my insanity, as it were. Lots of nice dinners at my house and lots of ""The Story of Film."" Needless to say, everybody I know finds something missing: an important director, an important individual film. Everybody hates something that Cousins loves. (He is is full of hyperbolic praise for the most surprising things.) But we all agree -- this is a stunning achievement. One of the greatest things about it, by the way, is that it makes you want to see hundreds of movies again or for the first time. If I had the energy, I would remove almost all the negative remarks I have made below -- but best to leave it as it stands. I do have to add, however, not one of my friends has any objection to the way Mr. Cousins speaks. I also no longer find that his remarks interfere with the zillion film clips. Just imagine the mountainous task of selecting and obtaining the rights to them!

Earlier review: This huge ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey"" is an odyssey for sure in the way the author/narrator's ideas stray all over the place intellectually and geographically. But it is coherent unlike Godard's ""Histoire(s) du cinma."" It is also highly idiosyncratic and the author's opinions are right in your face. He makes sweeping pronouncements on who and what is great. One is likely to disagree with many of his powerful convictions.

Here at Amazon, I have read a number of unfair negative customer comments. Many people cannot stand Mark Cousins' Northern Irish accent -- a nasty prejudice I find offensive. It is true that his speech is lilting, even lulling, and virtually every statement sounds like a question; but would these same commentators attack speakers with other national or ethnic accents? And how seriously are we to take comments from people who have seen only two or three hours out of a 15-hour project?

This is not a set to buy if you are seeking a wonderful series on the ""Golden History of Hollywood."" Cousins does not ignore Hollywood altogether, of course (how could he?) -- but the glamorous studio years are shoved way, way off to the side. Except in one episode, Cousins makes references to Hollywood only as needed. When he reaches the '60s and '70s, American film comes more solidly into the picture. In general, Cousins admires almost all of the American based directors that European intellectuals fashionably admit into the Pantheon of greatness (Sirk, Wilder, Ray, Minnelli, Donen, Hitchcock, Ford, Lynch etc.). In this way he is predictably tiresome, and one even suspects an anti-American sentiment lurking beneath the surface of everything. Certainly the many full-color inserted shots of LA seem designed to make it look as tacky as possible.

So -- for a documentary that calls itself ""The Story of Film,"" it is lousy as a study of American film per se. But Cousin's brief comments on everything he treats are of interest. He offers one insight after another, and his explanations of technical developments would be perfect for film students. He is always discussing lighting, atmosphere, mise en scene, camera angles, camera lenses, and everything that has to do with content and meaning of a visual image. His comments on the advent of digital and CGI techniques are especially good. The viewer is likely to have a series of epiphanies.

India, China, Egypt, Japan, South America, Mexico, Spain, France, Denmark, Sweden, England, Hungary, Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia,  -- these and more give a sweep to his narrative. I learned about many films I have never heard of before in my life and now am anxious to see.

The film intercuts contemporary documentary footage (apparently freshly shot for the documentary itself) of all the international locales discussed, often showing us a brief glimpse of the way something looks now. For instance, in a the section about Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, there are flashes of the locations today. For instance, Chaplin is on a street corner with the blind girl in ""City Lights,"" and for a second or two we see that empty corner as it looks now -- namely dreary!. We learn about the Shaw Studios in China -- and then see those studios today etc. A technique Cousins uses is to intercut examples of the later influence of a an earlier director on the work of a later one. So, when we learn about Chaplin, we see examples of his influence on other comic actors and filmmakers.

One slightly annoying thing is that Cousins often talks his way through many of the film clips. I think it helps to know something about movies to start with -- but this essay (I think that is a better term than ""documentary"") is bound to broaden the horizons of any serious film lover.",1356739200,101,4974,4.79463243873979
5198062,1,B008ZDC7M8,"I have only watched the first two discs so far and will probably only get back to watching the rest if I ever I run out of other things to watch. There were so many mistakes that could have been caught by interns with good information editing skills and a desire to fact check. There are misappropriations of titles, there are wrong dates given for films. There may even be willful omission of information, but I can't be sure. To make this short let me include just one example: The General was a silent film not a late 1930s film. In the section about the coming of sound, we hardly have any time to actually listen to any of the film clips of early sound films because Mark Cousins is always talking over them, and to many people, his voice is very grating. This is not a history of film as much as it is a personal free association: spoken poetry and musings set to film clips. It's Cousins' personal poem/opinion, to which he is entitled but it IS NOT an accurate or concise history regardless of the choices of inclusion or exclusion he has made, and particularly when he imagines influences of one director's work on others' without providing any proper links other than they look similar and therefore one must have influenced the others. I imagine that Cousins' knowledge ranges to the more contemporary and thus, the later discs about the global history of the last twenty years will probably be more thoughtful and better researched, one would think. However, his production staff's knowledge and absolute confidence in this limited knowledge of the first 50 years of film history can be disputed by going to more complete sources who rely on primary information. I would never recommend this to anyone who actually wanted to learn about the history of film. For those who want a personal long-winded ""story"", this is it.",1355875200,49,1832,4.674922600619195
5198063,2,B008ZDC7M8,"I'm giving this film 2 stars, as the first 2 DVDs are interesting and informative.  Unfortunately, the remaining DVDs are not.  While the inclusion of global films is excellent, I was looking for a series that covered ""the history of world cinema"" and instead ended up with Mark Cousins rather limited personal opinions.  The first 2 DVDs give a history of film and how techniques and concepts were originated by one film maker, and then used and varied by those who followed.  The remaining DVDs, while on occasion make mention of film techniques and ideas, generally are used to reflect Cousins personal views and politics, as if those are the factors which determine the historical or artistic value of a film.

I had purchased 2 of these sets - one to watch and the other as a gift, but after watching the entire series, I opted to find something else to give as a gift and tossed the extra DVD set, as I did not want to waste my friend's time.",1355788800,16,948,4.52046783625731
5198064,5,B008ZDC7M8,"Having recently finished watching all 15 hours, I can honestly say that this is a fascinating documentary. Don't listen to the other reviewer who complained about Mark Cousins' narration. His Irish accent is extremely pleasant to listen to. Buy it and you won't be disappointed :)",1355702400,14,280,5.108695652173913
5198065,5,B008ZDC7M8,"I subscribe to Sight&Sound magazine and have more Criterion films than I can count. I'm delighted to find a series bringing 15 hours of thinking outside of the E-Hollywood Story. All the names that should be there are present from Florence Lawrence to Lars Von Trier. Like the BBC series 'Wonders of the Universe', the presentation has a subtly experimental British edge putting Ken Burns and Oliver Stone's Secret History series in the dated category. I imagine many big name directors will have this in their personal collections.

Other reviews are commenting on the narration, but this series does not court the TruTv documentary audience. His calm delivery is like an Irish Carl Sagan. I'm fine with it, as Mark Cousins allows the images to speak on their own terms.",1355616000,18,771,4.930769230769231
5198066,1,B008ZDC7M8,"I just received my copy of ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey"", and I'm having trouble getting through the first episode. It's a shame that the writer/director, Mark Cousins, didn't have a trusted friend around him who was honest enough to say, ""Hey, your narration, to be kind, is lousy. Use a pro.""

Cousins has a strange speech affectation while narrating where he ends every sentence as if he's asking a question. It's not a natural way of speaking. A statement ends with a downturn in tone, a question ends in an upturn. He ends virtually every sentence with an upturn in tone. The thing is, I've heard him speak in another documentary, and that odd delivery doesn't exist! So, it seems his narration style was actually a conscious choice. It may sound trivial but, believe me, after several minutes of this, let alone several hours, it becomes very grating.

Alas, Mr. Cousins is an example of a filmmaker whose ego ruins what might have been his masterpiece. But the film has other problems besides the narration.

As for the history of film presented, from what little I could watch, I found it preposterous. Cousins has very few ""experts"" on camera to back up his assertions, so we are to believe what he says just because he says them? He has the audacity to state that one filmmaker ""borrowed"" from or was ""influenced"" by another because of a slight similarity of a scene. This isn't fact or history, it's his opinion!

Somebody was foolish enough to indulge Cousins by giving him a ton of money to ramble and mumble
over disjointed scenes of film clips and his ridiculous reconstructions of filmmakers techniques. Unfortunately I was foolish enough, and a big enough film buff to be awed by the title and the length of the series, to hand over my money without knowing anything about the film's contents or its writer.

I would implore anyone reading this, do not throw away your hard earned money on this trite. If you must watch it, Netflix has the entire series available for instant streaming. I'm quite upset because I paid for it before it was available on Netflix.

There are many who will defend this film, calling it a masterpiece, epic, historic and a thousand other flowery adjectives. That's OK, denial is understandable after spending $60 and expecting so much and getting so little. Poor souls, they tied themselves to a chair and kept their eyelids open a la ""A Clockwork Orange"" because, damn it, this film is important! It's long and was expensive! So what if one can't hear half the things Cousins says, because every sentence he utters trails off into an incomprehensible mumble. This is fine since only half of what he says is accurate anyway. And that's debatable.

If you're still planning on purchasing ""The Story of Film"", do me, rather, do someone a huge favor and buy it on eBay...""like new, only partially watched...""",1355529600,53,2852,4.737903225806452
5198067,5,B008ZDC7M8,"My copy of THE STORY OF FILM arrived yesterday and I dove into it immediately.

I have watched the first 3 episodes and so far am really glad I sprang for this set, and I can imagine re-watching it often. Already I am caught up in Cousins' approach, and he continually offers insights I've not encountered elsewhere.

I agree somewhat with the previous reviewer; Cousins perhaps was not the best choice to narrate his own project. To my American ears, his Ulster accent makes each? sentence? sounds as if? it is a question? It is becoming disconcerting. I have been watching Kevin Brownlow's & David Gill's HOLLYWOOD (Thames TV) series, and James Mason's narration is so wonderful in that, but HOLLYWOOD is a less personal approach than THE STORY OF FILM is, I think, intended to be.

The price is reasonable for this immense documentary, considering the number of film clips involved*. (*Christian Marclay's masterpiece THE CLOCK is comprises a virtually uncountable number of film clips, and I don't expect to see a home video release of that art object in MY lifetime.)",1355443200,31,1072,4.8469945355191255
5198068,5,B008ZDC7M8,"Let me be clear that i have not seen this yet so this is a hypothetical review.  First of all let me just say that I very nearly had the chance to see all 15 hours of this giant undertaking.  I am in the habit of going to Minneapolis every 3 weeks to visit friends and see films.  Sadly, the weekend The Walker Art Center was showing 5 hours of this each day did not match up for me.  I have no doubt that this won't be worth my time.  Just the fact that Mark Cousins talked with Lars von Trier for this---and after he put his foot in his mouth at Cannes von Trier said he is not doing interviews anymore---might just be one of the better reasons to get STORY OF FILM (the others being Claire Denis, Wim Wenders, etc. and on and on).

But I must say I am saddened that it has taken so long to come out on DVD (original release date was Nov. 20th and I am a very impatient person).  Nevermind something of this magnitude should probably have a Blu-ray release.  The only other thing I can complain about is the price.  As $60 is not bad for 15 hours worth of viewing, I am tempted just the same to cancel my order before tomorrow and hopefully buy from a third party for a cheaper price.  Hey, Amazon its Christmas and I am not a wealthy person this time of year.",1355097600,3,1262,4.05241935483871

5198073,3,B008ZDC7M8,"PROS:
1. Does make for great fun watching with a friend making fun of and mimicking the way he says every sentence with the EXACT SAME vocal inflections. We had a great time. Helps keep you alert throughout. If you watch these alone, disregard this pro.

2. If you enjoy a good nap once in a while or just suffer from insomnia, binge-watching a couple of these is guaranteed to have you out like a light. Even when you WANT to pay attention his voice is an audio anesthia and you will lose that battle.

3. The benefit of nodding off during these things is that they're always new! You never know what you might see on a repeat viewing that you'd napped through before!

CONS:
1. He spoils quite a few of the movies he talks about -- major plot points, endings, character development and more! All of which is dropped nonchalantly like they asssumed everyone has already seen those films. PRO #3 applies here as you'll often only be half awake and totally forget by the time you get around to watching it.

CONCLUSION:
 Great series! There's nothing that compares to it. At almost $40 that's a little pricey for what you're getting but if the series sounds appealing you'll enjoy it, or you won't. I'd recommend this only to budding cinephiles and insomniacs.",1489795200,,1259,4.553097345132743

He takes a world view at different periods of film history which will expose many to hitherto unknown works of art. I am acquainted with classics outside of the Hollywood dream factory but I am humbled by the many important movies and artists I was unfamiliar with. I recently viewed ""The House is Black"" and ""Black Girl"" and was overwhelmed by the artistry and feeling for human suffering portrayed. I do not believe Cousins is overly critical of Hollywood. The language of film embraces many cultures and genres. We are shown varied approaches to depicting the human condition through the medium of celluloid which has now transitioned to digital. Even as technology advances, the heart of the world of film is the expression of ideas as it  relates to people in all countries. Films show the bonds we share through the joys and heartaches of the diverse human community. We are also supplied with Cousins' excellent technical analyses. My only criticism is that in his zeal to portray the significant scenes in many movies, there are many spoilers.

Did the filmmaker think we didn't know what wind in trees looked like? Granted, we are all spoiled today.

The narration was horribly annoying and ruined the whole experience for me. It's amazing that this narrator, the worst I've ever heard, could be approved by anyone from the long list of film professionals associated with this production--what a stupid mistake. The narrator's voice is really annoying and his delivery is so flat and void of any expression. The narration is almost constant and you can't avoid it, and since it's so terrible, it becomes a great distraction.
This is a great example of how a project with a great potential for success turns into a fiasco due to a stupid mistake!  I am a film professional and scholar for many years and taught film in college but I think anyone else would be just as disappointed.

5198114,2,B008ZDC7M8,"I'm glad I'm not the only one disappointed with this project.  There was and still is a lot of hype about it.  The bottom line is that it's one guy's monologue on film history, it's got some mistakes, the original footage shot for this project (in between the famous clips) is absolutely amateurish and in some places downright embarrassing.  He also gets some facts and terminology wrong here and there.

Whatever possessed him to narrarate this himself is beyond comprehension.  Why he didn't get a professional to narrate must come down to ego.  His voice is anemic and irritating.  Someone compared it to a ""valley boy"" and all of his sentences that end on an ""up"" note are what makes him sound like he's from Sherman Oaks.  It gets old fast.

He crosses the 180 line but not to great effect.  He's no Godard.  I'm not sure he even realizes he did it.  He was demonstrating the invention of the reverse shot, but it's jarring and doesn't work.  He intercuts a homely urban woman in a winter parka with important historic films.  It just doesn't work.  One would think he'd have learned a little about cutting from the Soviets, but apparently not.  Film critics and historians often don't make good filmmakers themselves... they're too stuck in their heads.

Anyway, some of the info is good, some of it isn't accurate and the original footage is downright awful at times -- and for the next 15-16 hours of your life you'll be subject to one of the most irritating voices you'll ever come across (Irish accents are usually cool and sexy, but his voice just makes your skin crawl).",1425254400,5,1583,4.636690647482014

It's done very well in a concise way, sort of whittling it all down to the essentials yet having all the right visuals for the script, the huge mistake is that the creator comes off as pretentious by sacrificing the whole film in his need to narrate it. His voice is incredibly tiring, boring, annoying, unnecessarily strange in tone etc. etc.

That said, I found almost all the scenes that were shot as visual accompaniment to the narrative unpleasant and totally unaesthetic. The awkward framing of exterior city shots were especially hard to watch and often didn't correlate effectively with the narration. They were, in fact, so uninspired I found it bizarre that a documentary obsessively meticulous in its descriptions of cinematic aesthetics could be entirely lacking when it came to its own visual portrayals.

People looking for an objective film on the history of film will be disappointed or confused. I myself, a fascinated cinemaphiles, would have chosen quit a few different films. But I have a fraction of the skill of Mark Cousins. It is like using someone else's eyes.

Not only is it interesting to see a different view of film, but every now and then there is one film that I missed and looks like I must purchase to see what it is really about. I never heard of ""Queen Kelly"" (1929).I watched a lot of Carl Theodor Dreyer films but never thought of his fascination with ""White"" I was to intrigued in the films to notice. I watched ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1919) and never got the impression it had anything to do with the German State. Now waiting for a copy of ""Kurutta ippji"" (1926) that is not in 3D. For people that gave up on the series by this time missed much as Mark Cousins is just getting off the ground.

5198139,2,B008ZDC7M8,"My first thought when watching this documentary is that scene from Anchorman when somebody accidentally puts a question mark in Ron Burgundy's teleprompter. I know that criticizing the guys accent is not very cool but dear Lord it really detracts from his work. I want to learn more about film and all the foreign crap that Cousins rambles on about, but I just can't tolerate the voice. His voice is somehow, all at once, monotone, forever up-rising-inflected but still somehow trailing off at the end of sentences, and broken up like the middle Brady Bunch brother. The overall effect completely takes me out of what the documentary is trying to convey, so it is hard for me to give an unbiased review of the content.

However, what Cousins does make clear is that he dislikes mainstream Hollywood movies, i.e. all your favorite movies. He comes up with some definitions on what ""classic"" movies are and then tells you that the movies you have always considered to be classic are not classic, but rather ""romantic"". What is classic, you might ask? Some junk from Sweden or Russia that you have never heard of.

What I gathered from what I have watched (about 4 episodes) is that Cousins is like one of those annoying music hipsters who will tell you that Led Zeppelin sucks or Nirvana sucks because they were too mainstream. The really cool music is this underground stuff that you have never heard of but is so much better than that stuff you are listening to.

He obviously is well versed in film from all over the world, which is really cool. He could really turn us on to some things that we would not otherwise be exposed to, but he chooses to tell us about the movies in a very condescending way, like the aforementioned hypothetical music hipster who would tell you about how this rare Pixies B-side that he has is so much better than all the mainstream Pixies music you have been listening to and how your entire view on this art is misinformed. Maybe we are just film plebs compared to the vast knowledge of Cousins as he tells us that this unknown Japanese filmmaker from the the 30's is so much better than our mongrel American directors and the pablum they churned out for the capitalistic Hollywood system, but the way he tells us makes you want to crush a cigarette out on his arm and force him to watch Half Baked on endless repeat at 120 decibels, chained to a chair, Clockwork Orange-style, complete with the blink suppressors.

I doubt that I'll be able to finish the series; it has taken me a month to watch the 4 of 15 episodes that I have gotten though. But I have kept going back because there is something to be learned here (I think) but  think that very few of us will make through his accent or the holier-than-thou attitude to find it.",1394064000,4,2763,4.551307847082495

5198141,1,B008ZDC7M8,"I spent 15 weeks watching this unfold on TCM. I would recommend watching about two thirds of the films mentioned in the series and shown along with it on TCM. What follows are my comments on each chapter as it unfolded and I blogged about it.

The Story of Film- Chapter 1: 1895-1918-The World Discovers A New Art Form ('11)--This is the first chapter, out of fifteen, in a history of film. It shows some of the post-modern obsession with race and gender. It has the decided benefit, once you ignore the class, gender, race nonsense, of explaining some of the technical aspects of film, and of showing how they were used.

The Story of Film-Chapter 2: 1918-1928-The Triumph of American Film and the First of Its Rebels ('11)--This is supposed to cover the period 1918-28, but the first 10-15 minutes of it deal with films outside of that time period. It is also supposed to be American oriented, but an equivalent amount of time towards the end is spent on Russian film and on Carl Dreyer. Dreyer's movie about Joan of Arc will be coming up next week, and I'll have more to say about it then, but my recollection from when I saw it over 40 years ago is that I didn't like his portrait of Joan. There is a major error in what the film says about Chaplin. He's described as being driven out of the US. Chaplin never became a US citizen, and retained his British citizenship. He was investigated for Communist activity, and he had been trouble on statutory rape charges in the past, so the government, despite his never having been convicted, was probably right to regard him as of dubious morals. He was denied a re-entry permit, which could not have happened had he become an American citizen, and he refused to go through the process that would have allowed him re-entry. So he stayed in Switzerland. The narrator, Mark Cousins, is quite frankly boring, and his manner of speaking annoying.

The Story of Film-Chapter 3: 1928-1932-The Great Rebel Filmmakers Around the World ('11)--Mr. Cousins does not like Hollywood movies, and praises the work of foreign directors. Out of a universe in which there are many great and talented and famous directors, Griffith, Hitchcock, Truffaut, Walsh, Eisenstein and dozens of others, he chooses as the greatest director....Yasujir? Ozu. You never heard of him? Neither have I.
Love Me Tonight ('32) (U.S.A.)--I messed up on recording this one, but I think I've seen it before. The big thing about it, which Mr. Cousins brings out in Chapter 4, is the use of sound , and the way in which the film is edited, particularly the opening number Isn't It Romantic. The film is a fairly standard film for Jeannette MacDonald. I should say that my favorite film of Ms. MacDonald's is San Francisco, which, while non-musical, does feature her singing.

The Story of Film-Chapter 4: The 1930s-The Great American Movie Genres and the Brilliance of European Film ('11)--Despite being nominally about the great American movie genres it spends more time on foreign films. He says that Kurosawa's Seven Samurai was inspired by the gangster films of the 1930s. I may be wrong, but I think it's more likely to be the Westerns and not the gangster films.

The Story of Film-Chapter 5: 1939-1952-The Devastation of War and a New Movie Language ('11)--At this point, after five episodes, I am really beginning to hate Mr. Cousins' voice. His upward lilting inflection every three words, which places the inflection wrongly every so often, grates upon the nerves. As for what he has to say in this episode, I'm afraid that I think he's a bit mistaken in some of his judgments. He makes much of Kenji Mizoguchi's deep focus and deep staging in Osaka Elegy from 1936, yet does not mention that that those techniques were used, quite impressively, in King Vidor's The Big Parade. The scene shone on the left is impressive in its depth, and the way in which the fear and tension is shown not just on John Gilbert, the foregrounded actor, but the rest of the company as they advance. Mr. Cousins also seems obsessed with the Hollywood orthodoxy that the Hollywood 10 were martyrs to a sacred cause, and that people, like Elia Kazan, who named names were bad people.* He is also terribly impressed by Italian neo-realism. I like some of Roberto Rosselini's films from this period, notably Rome, Open City and Paisan, while disliking Germany, Year Zero, but it is worth remembering that much of what passed for theory was justification for stuff that was done out of poverty. The Italian neo-realists used non-professional actors because they couldn't afford to hire pros. Some of the other films of the genre, such as Bicycle Thieves, I find generally unlikeable.
The Story of Film-Chapter 6: 1953-1957-The Swollen Story: World Cinema Bursting at the Seams (`11)--OMG! This chapter is so bad that it's actually driven me to teen-girl-speak. Mr. Cousins opens with a scene from Rebel Without A Cause and assures us that while James Dean may indeed appear to be in it, the real James Dean is Youssef Chahine, the director of Cairo Station. In the course of the chapter he has several minutes of narration about film while the camera stares at a modern city street. Did he ever hear about story boarding? Come on you're 48 (b. May 5, 1965), plan the bloody movie in pre-production. Some people pointed out that in his discussion of The Seven Samurai he misidentified one of the Samurai. He then fixates on how world cinema was bursting with passion, including sexuality. He cites Cairo Station as an example of the expression of a formerly repressed sexuality, and then omits any discussion of the awful politics of Egypt, and its repressive religious regime that was either coming to power, or in power when Mr. Cousins was doing his documentary. There's a brief denunciation of McCarthyism and HUAC. He has an interview with a filmmaker who survived Mao's Cultural Revolution, and while he notes his torture and mistreatment does not engage him on his return to favor.

The Story of Film-Chapter 7: 1957 ? 1964-The Shock of the New: Modern Filmmaking in Western Europe ('11)--Not as bad as some of the other chapters, but he has too many shots of Les Deux Magots and Cafe de Flore that add nothing to the subject he is discussing. He also thinks highly of Jacques Tati, and I'm afraid that the elevation of Jacques Tati to the ranks of comic genius is on a par with the French admiration for Jerry Lewis. Totally ridiculous, and something that makes a mockery of French pretentiousness.

The Story of Film-Chapter 8: 1965 ? 1969-New Waves Sweep Around the World ('11)--Mr. Cousins is less annoying in this chapter. He's too enamored of left wing films though. He makes a point of praising I Am Cuba, for its visual style in one of its segments without mentioning the monstrosity that is Castro's Cuba. He interviews Ken Loach, who voices a negative throwaway comment about Margaret Thatcher, and does not mention that Loach's calls for an artistic and cultural boycott of Israel mark him as a probable anti-Semite.

10:00 PM The Story of Film-Chapter 9: 1967 ? 1979-New American Cinema ('11)--Mr. Cousins talks about American directors in this episode. He goes on a bit about how American movies had not focused on the Jewish experience in America even though the moguls were largely Jewish. True enough, but their audience was largely Christian, predominantly Protestant though with a large Catholic minority. He then cites Felix Bressart as a Jewish actor who fled the Nazis. However, when he talks about Mr. Bressart's Jewishness, he shows a clip from The Shop Around the Corner in which Bressart's character is clearly not Jewish, something he indicates by mentioning the familial exchange of Christmas presents. Mr. Cousins exaggerates the absence of Jewish themes in films previous to this period. The Jazz Singer is about a Jewish singer, and features Jolson singing Kol Nidre. The movie also deals with the theme of Jewish identity and assimilation. Another film that deals with the issues of Jewish identity, assimilation, and anti-semitism is The Younger Generation (1929. dir. Frank Capra; Jean Hersholt, Lina Basquette, Ricardo, Cortez). A couple of years later we have Street Scene which deals with themes of immigration, anti-Semitism, and religious inter-marriage. In 1940 or 1941 prior to America's entry into the war we have Once Upon a Honeymoon a romantic comedy with moments of drama. In that movie Ginger Rogers surrenders her passport to protect a Jewish hotel maid, and Cary Grant is appalled at the practice of forced sterilization that is in place in Germany and occupied areas. In the post-war era we have Gentleman's Agreement and Crossfire which deal with polite anti-Semitism (exclusion from country clubs, restrictive covenants in the purchase of real estate) in the first, and nasty anti-Semitism (murder) in the second. Auntie Mame and A Majority of One also featured Jewish themes prominently. In 1960 we've got Judgment at Nuremberg which deals with the Shoah explicitly, though not exclusively. While Jewish themes are not heavily emphasized in American cinema, they are present. He goes on about how wonderful Woody Allen's films are. I'm afraid that I haven't liked a Woody Allen movie since he decided he's the American Ingmar Bergman, and gave up making funny pictures. The other directors that he favors are grouped into satirists and rebels. I'm afraid that I'm not impressed by re-watching The Graduate, and as we'll see McCabe and Mrs. Miller left me rather cold.
The Story of Film-Chapter 10: 1969 ? 1979-Radical Directors in the `70s Make State of the Nation Movies ('11)--If it's not his accent and his lilt that is annoying, then it's his dress. Showing up in the studio wearing a tee-shirt and slouching in the chair while Robert Osborne is wearing a jacket and tie and sitting in a relaxed fashion without slouching shows Mr. Cousins lack of respect for the host, and his audience. He goes into ecstacy, in the documentary, about how some guy was a Communist, and a supporter of the little people. Of course, he doesn't mention that the party of the little people was responsible for the Holodomor, the Ukrainian famine; the Gulag, re-education camps in China, Cambodia, and elsewhere, the deaths of thousands in Cuba, and throughout all the countries in which the Communists struggled. He's got more praise for the guy who did the awful Black Girl.

2:30 AM The Story of Film-Chapter 11: 1970s and Onwards-Innovation in Popular Culture Around the World ('11)--Mr. Cousins continues to annoy, and to get things if not wrong, not quite right. He goes into ecstasy over the Chinese, and Indian films of the time, citing one Indian film, which may be very well known in film school circles, as being particularly influential. Unfortunately, unlike say the films of Satyajit Ray, it never seems to have made it big here. He then goes on about The Message, and says that Islam forbids showing the prophet Muhammad. That's not quite right. The Sunni's have a thing about that, but even so there is art work that shows Mohammed, and you can wander through the Sackler and Freer galleries in DC and find pictures of the bearded one. He doesn't spend enough time, in my view, on American movies, though he does mention Spielberg and Lucas.

The Story of Film-Chapter 12: 1980s-Moviemaking and Protest Around the World ('12)--I really wish that Mr. Cousins would keep his political opinions to himself. He doesn't like Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan. To him they represent all that is evil in the world. Fine, we get it. He also doesn't like censorship and he is glad that after the fall of the Soviet Union movies that had been censored were finally allowed to be seen. Of course, he passes over the idea that the USSR might have fallen because of the efforts of Thatcher and Reagan. Nor does he discuss how the Soviet man in the street might have felt about the two. Granted those are off topic, but if he's going to pan Margaret and Ronald, then he should have a bit more discussion from the other side. Ideally he should simply note the protests, if necessary, against conservative government in the UK and the US, and pass on without implying his ideological position. He praises one Soviet film from the era as the best war movie ever made. Now that movie's not on the schedule that TCM has put up, so there's no way to judge. But it seems to me that there's a lot of competition for that title, and while he might be right, I find his judgment so screwy that I'll just have to reserve judgment. He goes into ecstasy over the films of John Sayles, and says that he made state of the nation films. Considering the batch that he tagged with that moniker before, I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

The Story of Film-Episode 13: 1990 ? 1998-The Last Days of Celluloid Before the Coming of Digital ('12)--One of my biggest gripes with Mr. Cousins, aside from the complaints about his damn lilt and his posture, is that he makes frequent references to the horrors and evils of McCarthyism and Ronal Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, but never acknowledges the evils of Soviet Communism, or of its various manifestations in China, Eastern Europe, Cuba, and elsewhere, places where evil political ideology did great harm. So he gushes over Iran and its filmmakers without mentioning that Iran is hostile to gays, represses women, and agitates for the destruction of Israel. If you're going to bring politics in, be fair. He also gushes about Funny Games because a character uses the rewind button to rewind the film, and alter the course of the story. How ironic. How post-modern. How irrelevant and silly in a story of sadism.

The Story of Film-Chapter 14: 1990s-The First Days of Digital: Reality Losing Its Realness in American and Australia ('11)--As Lucy would say to Charlie Brown, Good GRIEF!!! It's not bad enough that Mr. Cousins is an insufferable twit, but he appears to think that post-modernism, whatever that is, is good, rather than a steaming, stinking load of crap. He has raptures over Gus van Sant's remake of Psycho which features the repellent Anne Heche rather than Janet Leigh, and shows a bit more blood and a bit more skin than the original. Of course, Hitchcock was a genius and the original film is a classic. Gus van Sant is.... Well, lets be polite, and say that he's no Hitchcock, and his version of Psycho.... He also praises the Coen brothers. Now I've seen Blood Simple, O Brother, Where Art Thou, Fargo, and The Big Lebowski, and have not been terribly impressed by any of them. O Brother is probably the best of the lot. What Mr. Cousins sees in one movie as a homage to Busby Berkeley is to my mind a bad imitation of the great original. Then we have crazy, conspiratorial Oliver Stone and Natural Born Killers. Woody Harrelson is someone whom I've disliked ever since I first saw him. When he first appeared on Cheers I stopped watching because I found his character's stupidity repulsive, and as I heard more about the man I realized I had no interest in seeing him on the screen. The bit that Cousins shows from Stone's movie is remarkable only for its repulsiveness. At some point he exalts Baz Luhrman. Luhrman decided when he filmed Romeo and Juliet that America did not have the equivalent of the public square where the action of Shakespeare's play opens, so he would open his modernized version in a gas station, the equivalent of the market square. Now I was born in 1945 in Washington, DC, and lived in Falls Church and Arlington, VA from about 1950 through 1967. My wife grew up in a small town outside of Pittsburgh, PA. Neither of us can remember a gas station as a hangout for teenagers. Many small towns did, and probably still do have market or public squares, and certainly an enclosed mall would be a better contemporary hangout than a gas station. The big moment, when Romeo and Juliet meet, is moved from a ball to the hallway of a restaurant or night club. Rome and Juliet come out of the restrooms, and pass by a fish tank. Their eyes see each other through the tank, and they fall in love. This is supposed to be romantic love. This film may not be as bad as another film that Mr. Cousins finds fascinating, Cremaster 3. Never heard of it? Welcome to the club. Mr. Cousins has, and he loves it. You can read about it here. Remember what I said post-modernism is? Well this film is a big enough pile of it to fill the foundation for a new World Trade Center. Apparently what passes for satire is big in post-modernism. Though how much post-modern satire has in common with Aristophanes, Lucian, Ben Jonson, or even John Wilmot is unclear. In any case one movie that Cousins finds satirical is Starship Troopers. Now this is one of the few Heinlein novels that I haven't read, but I've read some of the material written about it. The novel is patriotic, but it also espouses ideas that are not quite popular. For example, the idea that citizenship, and the right to participate in government are earned by service to the country. Paul Verhoeven, the director, and Edward Neumeier, the screenwriter, apparently see the novel as glorifying fascism and Nazism. Since Heinlein was a retired naval officer, and an engineer on wartime projects, that characterization is not too likely. In any case, Verhoeven found the novel boring and stopped reading it. The big thing for Verhoeven and Neumeier was to equate Reaganism and conservatism with fascism and Nazism. The movie, which I saw some years ago, is actually pretty bad because neither director nor screenwriter are in sympathy with the source material.

The Story of Film-Chapter 15: 2000 Onwards-Film Moves Full Circle and the Future of Movies ('11)--Thank God my long personal nightmare is drawing to an end. Mr. Cousins is still the self-important little twit that we've come to know and despise. He opens the chapter by opining on the importance of the documentary in the decade under consideration. So he chooses as one of his examples a film by another self-important twit. This time a big, fat slob of a twit, Michael Moore. The film he chooses is Fahrenheit 9/11. Now I was never interested in seeing in any of his films, beginning with his first one, Roger and Me. It was simply beyond me why the chairman of GM should consent to see this non-entity. I certainly would not have let a creep like him on my property. As to Fahrenheit 9/11 the scene that Cousins chooses to include is that of President Bush at the school in Florida reading My Pet Goat to children. Moore does a voice over in which he says that there was nobody to tell Bush what to do, and several other things. He thereby implies that Bush is stupid, out of it, etc. Now Cousins lets this pass. He thereby uses this to affirm the message that Bush is/was stupid, thereby making his own documentary into a piece of propaganda. He fails to ask whether other presidents in similar positions did better. The answer to that question is unknowable because there was no press corps present when Roosevelt heard about Pearl Harbor, or Truman heard about the incursion into South Korea. He also doesn't ask, and it's a fair question, whether there was anything that could have been done immediately, or was it better to avoid panic, proceed as usual, and make a delayed exit. Once we get past Michael Moore's movie we move on to other movies. One Mexican movie features a shot of a naked Mexican girl and her somewhat darker lover. The girl is pretty enough, but the man is grossly overweight, and we really gain nothing from the shots of his equipment. He concludes the chapter by speculating on the future of film. The final bit is a shot of people at a film memorial, which appears to be a statue of badly stacked film cans, in Burkina Faso. The people proceed in what may well be a neo-pagan remembrance of the filmakers who passed away during the year. So ends the ramblings of Mr. Cousins.",1391817600,12,19920,4.758750361585189

Make sure you are WIRED with caffeine when watching it.  If you try to watch it late at night, Mr. Cousins will put you to sleep guaranteed.  In fact, one night, I was having a hard time getting to sleep and I put this on, any episode would do, and just had it play in the background.  I was out like a light in less than 5 minutes.

I'd almost love to see this overdubbed by someone with a lot more energy.  Imagining this series overdubbed by Martin Scorcese, for example.

5198148,5,B008ZDC7M8,"I saw just bits and pieces of this documentary on Turner Classics and picked it up at the library.  It is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  I say this as a person who makes industrial videos and has a Master's degree in film.  This five-disc set, narrated by Scotsman Mark Cousins, encompasses everything from film's invention to present day. Wonderfully edited; including people and films long forgotten.  The tendency with long documentaries that try to include everything about an art form, is to be overblown and over analyzed, this documentary touches on every aspect of the odyssey, without over doing anything. It is a huge task to touch on so many dimensions of film, but there are never times you feel bored or overwhelmed. The presentation is the key to this film's success.  There are filmmakers and actors I never heard of and their contributions could be technical, or emotional, or inspirational, but they are all viewed and analyzed. There are interviews with names you heard of like:  Bernardo Bertolucci, Haskell Wexler, and Paul Schrader and then there are people you may never have heard of like: Youssef Chahine, Abbas Kiarostami, and Yuen Woo-Ping. All have contributed to film and all talk about their contributions. Don't think you can get through this in one or two settings. Also, have a piece of paper to write down films and names you can later NetFlix to get a better sense of what the history of film is about.

5198151,5,B008ZDC7M8,"There are those who don't seem be able to stand this series, complaining of the narrator's accent and reading, and also the way it challenges some established (especially Hollywood/US- centric) interpretations of film history. On the first point, Cousins speaks the way many people from Belfast speak and he can hardly be blamed for being Irish.  On the second point, it's obvious going in that this work is a personal interpretation of film history that's intended to be thought provoking and challenging. It is not intended or presented as a standard historical overview, rather it's ""an odyssey"" just as the title declares. If you're looking for a traditional historical overview that leaves your pre-existing prejudices in tact, you might steer clear.

The attempted scope of the work is impressive. Hundreds of films, many of which will be unknown to an American audience are mentioned and many quoted (clearance must have been a nightmare). There are some brilliant observations and connections made. Sometimes Cousins attempts stretches he can't quite make, and some of the interpretation gets a little precious, but even in this the work is instructive. The interlude footage contains many visuals puns on what's being said if one watches carefully, and it's fun to figure these out. The interviews with writers and directors are shot in an anti-cinema style that those wanting something that looks like Discovery Channel talking heads may find off-putting. Again there's more method there than may at first meet the eye.",1385251200,20,1529,5.211382113821138

5198153,4,B008ZDC7M8,"'Tis said that the worst sin committed by any movie reviewer is to describe the movie that he or she would have made instead.  How-some-ever, I can think of no better way to critique Mark Cousins' intriguing ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey"" than by dragging him to the woodshed to teach the teacher a leson.  ""Intriguing"" because Cousins comes tantalizingly close to getting it right, but the misses are so woefully wide the mark as to put most viewers off...which is a tragedy because his insights are mostly so precise and so illuminating as to explain the very core of why the world is forever in the thrall of the medium (the cliche of ""the stuff dreams are made of"" to the contrary notwithstanding).

So, first off, the music has to go.  It is loudly percussive and serves no other purpose than to annoy the viewer.

Second, Cousins apparently dragged some talentless cinematographer around the world with him to film the historical locations to illustrate that which he's talking about.  These consist mostly of street scenes shot Andy Warhol-style with no apparent regard for content.  The shots are badly framed (wide-angle shots are best composed with the camera level and not pointed at the sky unless there's a plane up there that we're supposed to notice) and consist of little more than contemporary traffic whizzing by in the foreground...which makes no sense when Cousins is describing a 19th century film.  The only present-day shots that make any sense are those of filmmakers whom Cousins is interviewing.  That is, if no footage of ""The Battleship Potemkin"" is available, I would a lot rather see a 1925 postcard than a desultory steet scene of today's Odessa.

Thirdly, I wish the supers would identify not only the movies they are imposed upon, but whetever else might be in the background (personalities, studios, equipment, memorabilia, posters, scenery).  Photoplays themselves may not be enhanced by explanations, but a ""course"" in film history can only benefit from a surfeit of pertinent information.

Finally, Cousins has tried to stuff his arbitrary divisions of film history into a Procrustian bed of 15 more-or-less decades of different schemata (such as the unwieldy ""Japanese Classicism and Hollywood Romance, 1928-1945"") which are about as comfortable as a left shoe on a right foot.  If I were Cousins, I would have divided movie history into more universally recognized themes (chapters on ""Film Noir,"" ""Westerns,"" ""Science Fiction,"" ""Romance,"" ""Buddy Films,"" ""Musicals,"" ""Mysteries,"" ""War Movies,"" ""Comedies,"" ""Costume Dramas,"" etc.).  But, alas, Cousins seems to have lost my number.

I would normally have written off such a lumpy effort with two or three stars, but I think ""The Story of Film"" deserves four stars...and not just for his effort (which is epic in its scope).  Cousins utters some of the most interesting things I have ever heard about individual directors and individual films (he seems to have little use for process or technique; he describes most shots where the camera moves as ""tracking"" shots, whether or not it is a pan, arm, tilt, crane or steadicam).  Definitely worth a look-see.  If you don't want to commit to the fancy boxed edition, the whole shebang is currently available on Netflix.  (And then there's Cousins' book of the same name available from Amazon - advt.)

Some commentators have disapproved of Cousins' lilting Irish accent (and the fact that he often talks over the dialog of the shot he's describing), but I find his voice charming and natural.  If he taught a course at USC or UCLA, I would be there in a heartbeat.",1384214400,2,3598,4.993299832495812

As a lover of independent film, this 5 Disc epic gives me greater insight into the films I have seen, and leads to new films I haven't seen.

Cousins covers technique, directors, styles, actors, writers and everything else it takes to make cinema. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspect of this series, is how in poor countries around the world, they have created such masterpieces, on shoestring budgets. With little equipment and experience, desire and drive have leapfrogged over Hollywood's billion dollar boondoggles. It almost brings a tear to your eye when you realize what Hollywood could have put out if artistic expression had been the goal, instead of control.

It's not only difficult to understand the narrator but the content is impressionistic and filled with poorly made contemporary restagings that simply pad the narration.  For example, a commemorative plaque that once belonged to Edison is shown and discussed rather than another example of an Edison short.  Similarly, the discussion of editing in Early Cinema uses as an example another poorly made scene of a contemporary woman in an underpass looking straight at the camera. It looks like a home video made by someone with no production skills.  To complement these poorly made scenes, the narrator rambles about ""gorgeous photography and cross-cutting"" and the magic of cinema but gives no context and draws from examples outside of the period discussed.  For example the Early Cinema section features some clips from Edison, Pathe, and Melies, but also makes strange and unmotivated comparisons to examples from contemporary cinema and various national cinemas.  The narrator occasionally has some good insights (especially when it pertains to women directors and screenwriters) but for the most part it comes across as jumbled and impressionistic.

5198159,5,B008ZDC7M8,"I won't repeat what many of the other 5-star reviewers have said, only that I agree with everyone who has waxed enthusiastic about the breadth, depth, and scope of this astonishing work. To anyone who has trouble with the idiosyncratic points of view, I would say the following:  First, much said by Cousins is not all that idiosyncratic: he often expresses insights shared by many other critics and film-lovers, but does so in his own compellingly unique forms of expression.  Second, the many insights that can aptly be described as idiosyncratic make the work that much more engaging and surprising, which is its very strength:  Would we really have needed another AFI-like compendium of conventional thinking about movies?

The one thing I would add involves the discussion about Cousins' narration.  I admit having had trouble getting engaged in the episodes the first few viewings, not because I disliked his accent, per se, but because I found the brogue hard to get used to - I had trouble focusing on the content because I was paying so much attention to what at first seemed like his vocal peculiarities.  But I soon got used to it, and then something odd happened:  I became rather addicted to the lilting sound of his voice. I began to notice that I enjoyed both his tone and timbre, and that upward lilting at the end of each sentence.  Especially that upward lilting.  Now, after seeing any new episode (I've been watching on TCM, now plan to order the DVDs), his voice is in my head just like the musical score of a memorable movie. In a way, I think that Cousins, wittingly or not, managed to merge narration and musical score in the most singular way. His voice is the music of his own documentary film, and it's quite beautiful, at times haunting, and it intermingles with the content--the images and ideas about film he presents--in such unexpected and at times revelatory ways.  I often can't wait to see and hear the last line of each show, because it always sums up what he's been trying to get across, with one last upward lilt of his inimitable accent. It makes me wonder what those people who reject the film because of the narrator's voice might be resisting. Listen, I was one of them:  I wondered whether I would stick with the whole program because I felt his voice was hard to tolerate; it kept throwing off my attention. Now I wonder if that response is some peculiarly American form of xenophobia.

5198167,1,B008ZDC7M8,"If you had to attend a slide show because you were staying at Uncle Dufus' house for Thanksgiving, and your mother told you you had to be polite, you could at least make fart and snore noises.  Mark Cousins is a complete idiot.  He does not use a fact-checker and I am sure he did not ask for any peer reviews.  He is afraid of criticism.  If you had a high school student who was assigned ""Kurosawa"" and looked up the Cliff Notes and said, ""Oh, better cover 'Ikiru' because the critics say it's his greatest film, and better cover 'Seven Samurai' because it's his most popular,"" that's what he does.  He says regarding ""Ikiru,"" ""The man was born in the feudal period and can't find his place in the modern world.""  Wrong!  Cousins is just like Lucy walking around telling Charlie Brown scientific explanations which she just made up.  The protagonist of ""Ikiru"" knows his place and that with terminal cancer he's going to disappear without a trace, but that's not what drives his character.  He circumvents the red tape in his department to help the mothers in the neighborhood to build a playground because he wants to create some minor goodness in the world before he dies.

Then regarding ""Seven Samurai,"" Cousins says, ""Katsushiro has become the greatest swordsman of them all.""  The character ""Kyuzu"" caught Cousins' eye and Cousins is too lazy to look up that he's named ""Kyuzu.""  Katsushiro is the youngest of the seven samurai.  Kyuzu is the ronin who lives to perfect his art of sword-fighting.

Cousins says ""Katsushiro"" -- meaning Kyuzu -- ""throws his sword away.  The era of the sword is over.  The era of the gun has begun.  The film is set in the past, but it echoes in the Fifties, because it's about the beginning of a new era.""  Kyuzu throws his sword at the enemy as a last act of defiance.  A samurai does not suddenly develop frustration with his sword and throw it away.  Kurosawa introduced the bandits' guns as an obstacle for the samurai.  The film is not about ""the beginning of a new era.""  It's about idealism.  It's about Kurosawa'a idea of a hero, someone with compassion, someone who has ""superhero"" powers, and someone who risks his life.  The fact that the bandits have guns, or that the peasants are only willing to pay the samurai daily food, or that the peasants turn out to have jewelry and sake and other valuables buried under their houses, are all obstacles Kurosawa introduces to make the samurai more heroic.

Also as someone pointed out on IMDb, Cousins says Americans were only interested in making escapist musicals, starring for example Betty Grable, during WWII.  He says Italian Neo-Realism after the war precipitated American film noir.  This is ridiculous.  The Germans were making dark crime films in the 1920s, German Expressionism.  The French were making film noir -- it's a French name -- in the 1930s.  The Americans were making noirs in the early 1940s.  Cousins uses ""Open City"" as an example of Italian Neo-Realism and the movie was not seen in America until 1946, then he cites ""Double Indemnity"" as a movie influenced by Italian Neo-Realism, which came out in 1944.  Really Cousins just got Cliff Notes and looked up ""What is the most famous Italian Neo-Realist film?"" and ""What is the most famous film noir?""  His label for an Italian Neo-Realist film says, ""The Bicycle Thieves.""  No, it's ""The Bicycle Thief.""  Similarly his label for ""Stray Dog"" said ""Stray Dogs"" in the part about Kurosawa.  The name of the Kurosawa film comes from the saying, ""A stray dog soon becomes rabid,"" meaning a young man without a job soon turns to crime.  (It's hard for us to imagine now, but everybody was buying and selling on the black market in Japan after WWII.)

Here is another one:  Episode 9, regarding ""The Conversation"" - ""The man becomes obsessed with the mystery on the tape.  In doing so, he almost has a breakdown.""  ""Coppola's film was about getting so lost in the fragments of other people's behaviors that your own life dissolves.""  Really?  This is how you summarize hearing a murder being planned, witnessing a murder, and being threatened with murder.  Why include a movie in your documentary if you have no idea what is going on in it?

In Episode 12, regarding ""Star Wars,"" Cousins says:

The film starts as a fairy tale.  A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  The words drag backwards into deep space.  The soundtrack, recorded in the relatively new format of Dolby stereo, seems to take place in deep space, too.  It felt as if the cinema shook.  And then models of spaceships glided past such wide-angle lenses that they plunged into perspective, too, and looked enormous.  The camera moves were programmed by computers.  Then the film introduces us to Luke, who will become a knight and save the universe.  We're in the realm of myth, and the film's design conjures the myth.  Interiors look like caves or kitchens or spaceships.  There is talk of a mystical force.  Luke dresses like a samurai.  We meet two robots, little and large, a metallic odd couple, and we see optically projected a message from a princess asking for help.  We hear of an evil emperor who director George Lucas saw as the shamed American President, Richard Nixon. This is the most absurd plot we have yet heard in the story of film.

*****

No film historian providing commentary on a DVD would simply describe what appears.  You get captioning for the hearing-impaired for free, so why hire a film historian?  No one educated would say the camera moves were ""programmed"" by computers.  They were controlled by computers programmed by people.  (Here is a golden opportunity for Cousins to use his favorite word ""innovative,"" but he fancies himself too sophisticated to praise ""Star Wars.""  John Dykstra got a special Academy Award for his pioneering work and the article in ""American Cinematographer,"" July 1977, in which he explains how to use a computer to synchronize the camera's passes over the spaceships, and how they matted them together so each frame might be a 64-item composite, is an expensive collector's item.  I remember xeroxing the whole article at the library, and then threw it away because the xeroxes were stinky and faded to illegible, because of the coated paper they used in the 1970s -- if only I had purchased the magazine!)  ""The film's design conjures the myth.""  What is that supposed to mean?  A ""space fantasy"" movie, as Lucas called it, is designed to look like it is set in a fantasy world?  Duh.  ""Interiors look like caves or kitchens or spaceships.""  Really?  Aren't you going to comment, ""The character is breathing in.  Then he breathes out.""  I don't believe George Lucas modeled the Emperor character in ""Star Wars"" on Nixon.  Cousins might style himself a film historian, but he is so ignorant, saying the light sabers are based on spears -- ""The robotic comic duo was based on two comic characters in Akira Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress' . . . and the spears in Kurosawa's film became light-sabers in Lucas'"" -- that he probably has never heard of Ming the Merciless, the emperor in ""Flash Gordon,"" who would make more sense if you want to suggest a basis for the Emperor in ""Star Wars.""  The Emperor, Darth Vader, the princess in distress and Luke's mentor are stereotypes from ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces,"" which George Lucas credits as the source of his story along with ""Flash Gordon.""

If you record ""Silent Sundays"" on TCM, sometimes Rudolf Valentino as ""The Sheik"" or Greta Garbo as ""The Mysterious Lady"" is thrilling.  The only good thing about watching this documentary is being reminded to study film history.

5198169,4,B008ZDC7M8,"I am almost 64 years old, and I am a life-long movie fan. I studied film and film history in college eons ago, in the '60's, and I have watched maybe 10,000 movies in my life. But I don't consider myself an expert. If I was, I'd probably have been a director or critic, and I'd definitely be more informed on world cinema (specifically, movies not made in the English-speaking world). I looked forward to Mark Cousins' The Story of Film: An Odyssey, but I have to admit that at this point--due to time constraints--I have watched only the first episode. However, I will definitely watch the entire series. Seems to me that people are making too much out of a couple of things, and collectively, these 'things' are precluding them from deriving any enjoyment or benefit from their experience.

Firstly, the Irish commentator. Geez, get over it, will you? Personally I enjoy the different dialect. I would throw out this idea (and I may be wrong): perhaps people who are most put off by his speech are the same folks who have a problem reading subtitles? If you have a problem with reading subtitles, you better get over it, IF you wiah to watch any movies not dubbed or not made in English, or for that matter, the majority of the films Cousins cites in his series! Martin Scorsese narrated his own wonderful homage to Italian cinema, My Voyage to Italy. He has a herky-jerky, frenetic, New York-style of speech, very far removed from 'The King's English', or typical American Midwestern, but that is OK. However, we know Scorsese....he made a lot of great movies, he is American. People who say things like, ""I know what I like, and I don't like that"" usually mean ""I like what I know, and I don't know that"".

Secondly, people seem outraged that Cousins has opinions which differ from the standard film history approach shared by many critics and historians (most often, American critics). I say that there is room for more than one opinion. He is sharing his own views, his discoveries, and his knowledge with us, and don't forget, this is a monumental series (15 episodes totalling 900 minutes!). Cousins has a love of film, the background, and the ability to write a literate sentence, which is really all you need if you wish to come up with your own film history! I applaud Cousins' achievement, and I am eager to hear what he has to say. He doesn't fall down in worship of Griffith and Hitchcock--a repatriated Brit who made his greatest films here in the US--and Welles? Fine, let's see who/what he does think. Howard Zinn wrote a socialist, alternative American history called The Peoples' History of the United States, which was far, far removed from the standard stuff people of my generation were taught in elementary school. Personally, in school I did not learn any American history from either an African American or a Native American perspective; I've had to research that on my own. My point is that we all benefit from each others' different opinions, experience and knowledge. Perhaps it is a reflection of the uncompromising, polarized political viewpoints in this country: ""I am right, you are wrong, so the hell with you!"" Instead of ""we differ, but perhaps we can learn from each other.""

Thirdly, the perceived bashing of American cinema and Hollywood. I tend to agree with Cousins on this point. The Jewish immigrants who started and ran American cinema in the early 20th century were primarily concerned with one thing and one thing only: making money. Hollywood became the mecca for American film mainly because the weather was so dependable, and a smorgasbord of outdoor scenery--desert, water, mountains, cityscapes--was close at hand. Thus, many movies could be made and could be made quickly and cheaply, which meant, a greater return on investment. The Hollywood studio system--and I am greatly oversimplifying here--was essentially a glorified slave trade where contract workers provided the labor, and the owners of production--the studio heads--reaped the major spoils. There was a constant battle of philosophies: entertainment (getting the most asses in the seats, i.e., $$) vs. art (creating the most meaningful and/or groundbreaking and critically acclaimed films). As judged by the critics, Citizen Kane has been for years one of the top ten 'greatest' American movies, but ask the average American who's seen it, and they will say something like ""I didn't understand it"", or ""it was amazing, but I did not like the Kane character."" Steven Spielberg's great achievement is that he is probably the American director who has been the most successful at creating films which strike a balance between art and entertainment, but Cousins is not going to bend over backwards in praising Spielberg. I believe Cousins is interested in other, lesser known films and directors. What is wrong with that?

Why do people see movies anyway? Many simply go to do something, to get out of the house, either literally or figuratively, to escape, to be entertained on an immediate level. If that is your main reason, OK, nothing wrong with that. You do not want to have to think or work or do anything other than sit there and enjoy it....like being on a rollercoaster. I would suggest that this series is not for you. On the other hand, if you do wish to learn something, to be transported to another place, to see how other people live, to experience, if only for an hour or two, what other people who are not like you have experienced, then, you are open-minded enough to enjoy this series.

Lastly, the 'mistakes' and errors in Cousins' series. I honestly don't know enough about the particular movies to tell if Cousins was actually screwing up. It would be interesting to hear what he himself would say on this matter, and it would perhaps be informative to determine if some of his statements were inaccurate. I guess it is possible that he made some mistakes. But my reaction to this is: don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. If he does make a mistake, or he does ramble, or he does make odd statements, hey, that is OK, he has the microphone. I think that that true value of this series is that it is enlightening and transcendental: he cites a film he found to be significant, which we've never heard of, and he leads us across the bridge into uncharted territory, IF we allow ourselves to follow him, see the film and be moved by it. That in itself makes us smarter and better informed.

I eagerly look forward to watching the rest of this interesting series.",1379894400,8,6498,4.7921498661909006
5198170,4,B008ZDC7M8,"The Story of Film is a great piece of work and a must-see for all true film buffs.  But, as has been pointed out in practically every comment/review, the narration is really awful.  Mr. Cousins sounds like one of the Beatles, ending every phrase on an up note, as if asking a question rather than making a point (fine in Liverpool, tiresome in Louisville).  He has obviously put his heart and soul into this, and, as is usually case when doing something by one's self, on probably a shoe string, sooner or later a corner or two must by cut.  But the presentation is the last place to do it.  What good is the work if the audience is too turned off to wade through it?

Maybe the documentary is trying to continue the age-old discussion of filmmaking as ""art"" vs ""commercial product"". In the first ten minutes we are told that ""Casablanca"" is not a ""classic film"", but a more obscure Japanese film is. As a long time fan of Japanese cinema, I'm intrigued by the argument.... I keep watching. The episode then goes on to talk about other films including ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", completely confusing characters and the story of the film. Has anyone who worked on this documentary seen the film?

I found Mark Cousins' narration to be informative but his condescending tone is really annoying. Also, he seems unwilling to stop his continuous narrative diatribe on film for a moment and let the film clips play on their own merits. I can't image watching 15 hours of this......

The documentary is obviously made by a film lover, but someone who mostly concerned with pushing his opinion of cinema. He also seems unfamiliar with some of the movies he is giving his opinion on.

5198176,1,B008ZDC7M8,"This longtime Film Advocate was appalled by Session 1 to the point that I have no intention of watching the other 14 segments.  On the entertainment level, the bland unimpressive voice of Mark Cousins was sleep inducing.  The never ending insults he made towards American Cinema were tasteless and nonfactual.  The irony was that not moments after saying inappropriate and incorrect evaluations about Hollywood, he then showed some segments of US films followed by praising terms.  This made the comments more that hypocritical in the philosophical aspects as well as the overall project's tone (and his voice, as mentioned previously, was toneless as well).  More importantly, the nasty anti-US attitude were not followed up by showing, in any depth, better films from other nations. Thus, his attempts to disparage American Movie production was not followed up to prove his point(s) that other places were equal to and better than what came forth from California.

In addition, the overall focus of the program was confusing in structure.  Cousins went rambling around timelines with 1980 films superimposed with 1896 movies.  This wound up making the whole concept of the session non-chronological despite the title -  ""The Story of Film:  An Odyssey.""  Had it been focused upon film techniques and/or cinematic grammar it might have been fine.  However, his constant jumping around on concept, timeframe, and failure to illustrate his ideas were another severe lack (and, to repeat, his bland voice was less than catching).

As a result, this longtime Film Historian - lecturer at MoMA, Festival Lecturer, who also was acquainted with both Blanche Sweet and Lillian Gish found the time watching a real waste.

That being said, there are some issues with the documentary, one of omission (which is understandable given the breath of film Mr. Cousins wants to cover) and the other of not dealing with some important definitions of film which are threatening to be changed.

The documentary is not as much ""The Story of Film"" as much as it is ""The Story of Film Directors."" A film is noted as important in the documentary when it is one that pushed the boundaries of film to a new level. Mr. Cousins generally engages in the oversimplification of attributing the final result of the film to the director and not nearly as much attention is paid to the cinematographers, actors, designers, or music composers.
With the exception of Walt Disney's ""Snow White,"" animation is almost entirely absent from the Story. More importantly, art and avant garde film is nearly completely left out, whose advances and radical ideas trickled their way down to mainstream directors and are the source of many iconic and groundbreaking images in mainstream film. Even important inventions, like the Steadicam, which for the first time in film history allowed cameramen to remove their cameras from the dolly track and gave them freedom to compose new and stunning images, like the iconic stair sequence in ""Rocky"" or the camera that tracks Danny in ""The Shining,"" were not mentioned.

As ""The Story of Film"" enters the 1990s, little or no screen time is given to the transitions into digital, and how some filmmakers see that as a destructive trend that is attacking the core definitions of what film is. Some examples:
*While Mr. Cousins defines Film as a medium that records successive images of light from the external world, he never addresses whether Computer Generated Imagery should be considered in the same category of Film or as Animation. In many major movies for the past two decades, entire sequences are created where there is no actual camera. Should movies with what are essentially long animated sequences be put on the same level as movies that capture light from the outside world?
*The use of Film vs Digital recording methods: there are some filmmakers who believe that film has inherently better qualities that are presently available using digital video cameras (image and color fidelity on digital still cannot match film), and that it is not an appropriate time for the industry to be transferring over to digital capture.
*Similarly, there is a debate whether there is an important difference over screening a movie using an actual film reel passing through light versus digital projection.

The documentary is worth your time, but you should try and keep in mind that there are definitely some major elements being left out. Hopefully Mr. Cousins will make additional features that go into these subjects in greater depth.",1374278400,5,3057,5.0

5198181,3,B008ZDC7M8,"As a filmmaker and student of film my interest in this collection was guided by customer reviews here. In fact, I stumbled into it while looking for an old film-history book I can't find anywhere, ""Behind the Silver Screen,"" which was my first film textbook (together with ""Film as Art"") in the '60s. I was very impressed with Mr. Cousins' ability to hop from one cultural context to another and bring the origins of one film to another into its impact on subsequent generations of film-making. The survey is amazingly comprehensive.

I was, however, turned off from the beginning when Mr. Cousins started his editorializing, trying to pass his opinion as historical fact on the value of one type of film-making over another. To assert that Japanese film is classic while Hollywood film is not at the beginning of the series made me weary of what was to come: not exactly a balanced account.

Some inaccuracies made me cringe. For example, when Mr. Cousins in Disc 2 refers to ""Dona Barbara"" (1943), directed by Fernando de Fuentes, he states that it was a representation of the Mexican woman as victimized. The film is actually set in Venezuela, in spite of its Mexican production, cast and crew. It was based on a novel by Venezuelan writer Rmulo Gallegos, the finest example of the persistent literary theme of civilization v. barbarism in South America, not a glorification or exultation of Mexican women. These details make his comments less trustworthy as the series progresses: it's always the danger of evaluating cultural aspects of art when such values are alien to the evaluator.

While I would recommend the collection to anyone interested in a visual encyclopedia on film, I warn the viewer of Mr. Cousins insufferably dull delivery as he narrates. It is uninspired and never changes inflection, which is the perfect combination for inducing sleep. I fell asleep so many times I had to keep going back to see what I had missed while I dozed off.
  (AN ADDITION TO MY INITIAL REVIEW:)
 When I first wrote a review for this product I had not yet watched the last two discs in the set. Nothing in these two invalidates my previous comments. However, they do add to my uneasiness about the content and format of the set.
 I was looking for a survey of film history. What I found is a very subjective and hperbolic defense of little known film productions. Good film does not need someone to state that it is ""the best ever in film history"" or ""the most beautiful,"" ""the most <everything>,"" as it stands on its own merits. Picking Gus van Sant as representative of American film trends in the '90s unsettled me, particularly because it was not van Sant's earlier work, such as ""Mala noche,"" that Mr. Cousins focuses on, but rather ""My Own Private Idaho"" and the orgasm scene.
 Mr. Cousins' biases are so obtrusive that they cloud the history of film as it developed in France, Hollywood or anywhere else. Covering the innovativeness of African film, Mr. Cousins presents ""Hyenas"" (1992), directed by Djibril Diop Mambty. His interpretation is that Mambety presented modern consumerism and capitalism in a condemnatory way. While that may be true, the story was based on ""The Visit,"" by Swiss playwright Friedrich Drrenmatt, whose focus was greed and vengeance. ""The Visit"" was filmed in 1964 with Ingrid Bergman and Ahtony Quinn. Mr. Cousins missed the opportunity to provide his viewers a greater service by contrasting the original ending of the story with Mambety's version instead of presenting the latter's film as representative of African film-making.
 His take on an uninterrupted crane sequence in ""Battle in Heaven,"" a commercial flop but an outstanding metaphor of contemporary Mexican society, is that it is meant to represent Mexican social disparity. He should have included Carlos Reygadas in one of his interviews and had Carlos explain this instead of asserting what the sequence is meant to convey: isolation, disconnectedness other than sexual among human beings, our incapacity to alter the world outside of us. It is a film about existential despair where social inequality is an aspect, not the focus. I remit the reader to my earlier comment on Mr. Cousins' lack of cultural understanding of the films he presents and his nonetheless free-handed comments about sociocultural issues.
 Some of Mr. Cousin's valuation of film technique either requires a superhuman sensibility to detect or a great ability for exaggeration and nonsense; after watching the entire series I was convinced the latter was more likely. Mr. Cousins strove to present something out of the ordinary and ended up presenting the weird as exceptionally  representative. The series should have been more aptly titled ""A Story of Marginal Film with Connections to Mainstream Movies."" His entire monologue, relentlessly uninspired, is occasionally broken up by interviews with off-Hollywood filmmakers. That is very interesting indeed, but none of the interviews actually add anything to our understanding of film in general. Van Sant's interview is particularly silly.
 The DVDs have technical problems. In some spots the video and the audio go completely dark; in others it breaks up as if it had been copied from VHS tape. The menus do not work right. Other than the ""Play All"" button none other seems to work. The left arrow takes the viewer to unexpected places, and although there is a ""Bonus"" section indicated on all discs, nothing really takes you there.

5198185,2,B008ZDC7M8,"Some reviewers have panned Mr. Cousins' effort for its inaccurate dates and its mixing of the various time-spans into which the author has chosen to divide movie history.  But my immediate, continuing, and greatest distress in viewing the disks was the dreadful narration, in which every phrase and sentence is read as a question.  Not one actual declarative statement is uttered -- as if the scriptwriter's word-processor produces a question mark every time the period key is touched.  And this is all delivered at the same deadly, measured tempo, scene after scene, with no emotion or engagement whatsoever.  I don't know who financed this film, but the thing should never have gone out without at least semi-competent narration.

On the plus side, and it takes a lot of plus to enable tolerating even a little of the narration, there are many scenes and film clips I hadn't seen before.  But since I was pressing the mute button most of the time, I didn't always catch their significance.",1367539200,12,991,4.904191616766467
5198186,1,B008ZDC7M8,"I am ashamed at what an impulse buy this was. But there just appeared to be so much integrity to the cover; all the titles of those excellent films, each with their own integrity to credit what I could only imagine to be the frontal lobe of all cinema knowledge, in convenient DVD format.

Oh, Jesus was I wrong. The first few minutes were spent praying that the narration was a team effort, so that shortly I might hear from someone other than a lilting-in-all-the-wrong-ways, disenfranchised man whose voice was as lipid and lifeless as a used bus ticket.

Turns out he wrote the bloody thing, and directed it- a fact which came to make more and more sense, the more images of trains and pointless street scenes I watched flash their way apathetically across the screen.
(And is it just me, but does absolutely nothing correlate?)
Not only do the street scenes look completely dated, but they detract from the- dare I call it- commentary.

What a shambolic, Hodge-podge of cinematic garbage, and what a fool I felt for sitting through more than one episode. How on earth could this vapid voice, a voice itself designed for silent film, ever hope to capture the excitement of a single part of the movie experience?

The answer is, I don't give a flying cahoot any more, and am now trying to pawn off this ludicrously expensive mistake any which way I can. Were I in the same country, I would drive to Mr. Cousin's home personally to fling it, corner-edge forward, at his temples. As it stands, I may actually make some money off it by using it as a sleeping aid, or perhaps a test-your-endurance game at carnivals. The only problem with the latter is that there's only one person on earth who wouldn't chew through his own knuckles to avoid more than an hour of this drivel. That person is Mr Cousins himself.

What an insult to film lovers, and under such a ludicrously overstated title. I wish to goodness I could get my money back.",1367452800,24,1935,4.564841498559078
5198187,5,B008ZDC7M8,"For anyone working in film or video production who missed film school, this piece is a must.  Beautifully produced, it covers film history from the perspective of directors seeking to use the means to explore and express truth -- social, political, psychological and spiritual.  Clips from the great films of the past century are used as illustration.  Key directors, actors and actresses involved in those films are interviewed.  These, combined with the insights of the narrator, Mark Cousins, are extremely helpful to anyone engaged in film or video production--or anyone interested in film beyond the level of Hollywood gloss.  This is much more of a philosophical and intellectual history than a mere chronicle of technical evolution.

So many American movies these days should have subtitles as the actors mumble quietly away in a variety of accents that makes for tiresome watching/listening to us non Americans. I absolutely love films from america but the indistinct speech makes comprehension not always easy.
I am sure Mr Cousins ""accent"" is/will be better than some mumbled regional accent from one of your many states.

However, I get it, y'all (that was intentional). I was initially put off, like many people, by his accent and had to think about my response.  Then I realized that other English-speaking dialects create a different sense of what the narrator is saying and Cousins is no accepttion. I thought he was hyberbolicaly arrogant until I listened enough to realize that his brogue is merely his brogue, just like any region of America or any English speaking country. And, most importantly, I realized that the series is decidely a personal, passionate love letter to cinema, with no attempt to represent an historical compendium. Resistance to his voice actually illuminates the profundity of his point of view: the world is made up of different voices, experiences, and realities, with far more voices located outside of the contiguous USA. I am disheartened at our reluctance to give ""different"" people, narrators a chance. It is very human, and at the same time, very perplexing.

5198192,5,B008ZDC7M8,"I watched this entire documentary.
Twice.

I found it incredibly engrossing and, as a digital film maker, was staggered by how much research, referencing, and time this took to put in a cohesive perspective.
It would've been daunting enough just concentrating on the Hollywood system and its history, but this finds relevance in global cinema.

A couple of reviews for this series that I find laughable at least and embarrassing at best:

""This is not a documentary of fact, but rather an opinion ""...

Uhm... yes, as all documentaries are subjective opinion. I suppose if you didn't pay attention to the first half hour of episode 1, you didn't pick up on the fact that a single editing point in any medium is a subjective decision. Nova, Frontline, CNN - Every single narrative constructed by people involves thousands of subjective choices in order to create that narrative.  The basic beauty of this series is that you are made aware of all of these works of cinema so that at the very least you could watch them and make your own decisions about what they mean to you.

Which brings me to the second comment I keep seeing:

""Why did they not get an actor to narrate and let Mark cousins narrate?""

My immediate question to that question is, why must every narrator be British or American with a predominantly Midwestern accent (they call it stage-standard in the biz)? I think his tone and dialect fit perfectly and, for me, created it's own sense of poetry.
But I feel, that a bigger issue with some of the negative reviews is that this film, in its showcasing other cinema from around the world, bashed a bit of American Hollywood cinema. Especially the contemporary Hollywood stemming from the 80s.
And rightly so, considering when you look at the last Golden age of our own cinema, it was in the late 60's/70s, with director-driven pieces where producers provided money and kept quiet (Easy Rider, Taxi driver, The French connection) to let the directors do their thing...
As opposed to today's system, where producers without any film experience are holding money over a director's head, and calling narrative shots that they have no business calling, out of fear that the story isn't easy enough to digest for our massive demographic called ""the middle.""
I suspect many people unaware of anything other than the Hollywood junk food, may find this alienating, boring, slightly offensive, or all of the above.

Watch at the risk of learning something new and feeling something different about what, for many people, is it's own form of religion.",1361232000,8,2554,4.839449541284404
5198193,4,B008ZDC7M8,"Okay. We need to be honest. The story of film in 15 hours is impossible. It's too huge with way too many facets and subtleties to cover in such short a time. That being said this is still a remarkable achievement.

I think Cousins was smart in his approach. He doesn't really tackle the technical achievements. He does mention them in passing but he more concerns himself with film language. He shows how this language evolved over time and who the important directors were that helped develop that language. There are hundreds of film clips here and he spends varying amounts of time on each one and relates the dynamic he feels is at work in each one. I have more than a few years under my belt and have been a film whore most of my life. He really opened my eyes on the way to view film. Truth be told, in some of the instances the techniques were so subtle, I doubt none but the most accomplished viewer would see what was at work. Then again, maybe they work on a subliminal level and the viewer is affected but might not know how or why.

He covers cinematic history in many countries. Interestingly, if you read Australian film historians, they were in the fray from the beginning. Cousins gives them all of about 15 or 20 minutes here. I'm sure there are other curious omissions but they aren't coming to mind. And others have mentioned their lament that Cousins chose to narrate this himself. It bothered me early on but faded as the time passed. I guess I simply got used to it.

Again. This is a remarkable achievement and should be seen by any fan of the art. It made me want to go back and look more closely to nearly every film I've ever seen.",1360454400,8,1657,4.355987055016182
5198194,4,B008ZDC7M8,"A really enjoyed The Story of film, how Mark Cousins was able to show what was going on wi nth films all over the world and how he could show the samples of the movies he was talking about. For me, maybe an actor could narrate it better.",1358726400,,237,3.9583333333333335
5198195,4,B008ZDC7M8,"The Story Of Film is a 15 hour documentary on film history.  David Cousins does not look at the usual films shown in documentaries on film history.  Don't expect to find in depth discussions on Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, or other typical films.  And Cousins makes a good argument for excluding typical romantic classical films.  This help to make The Story Of Film fresh & innovative.  You won't find a detailed discussion of Frank Capra, but you'll discover Yasujiro Ozu's contribution to film history.  Greta Garbo's career is not discussed, but you will be introduced to little known Chinese actress Ruan Lingyu.

Cousins strength is that he explains why the films he talks about are exceptional.  He gives a new perspective on how to watch a movie - why or (in some instances for me) why not the film is important to film history.  I am an avid film buff & thought I knew a lot about film history.  The Story Of Film really opened me to many films & filmmakers I knew nothing about - many have never been mentioned before!  He also shows how filmmakers learn from one another through time - how directors today borrow & expand on ideas from directors in the past.  It helps to understand why certain films & directors are important & relevant in film history.  This to me is the main strength of The Story Of Film.

After watching the first few episodes of The Story Of Film I wanted to see some of the films mentioned.  Many of them are not available.  Some of the directors mentioned have only a very limited selection available, which is sad but understandable in todays economy.  Many of these films do not appeal to a wide audience, unfortunately.

There are 3 negatives about The Story Of Film I have to mention.  The first one is the narration by Cousins.  For someone so passionate about film, his voice is very monotone and really lessens the impact of his documentary.  The second negative is that there are not enough film clips.  When discussing the relevance of a certain film, rather than showing a clip of the film Cousins shows a modern day shot of the city or country of the films origin.  It makes The Story Of Film less compelling.  The last negative is that I feel that some of the films/filmmakers discussed are included because of the country of origin & not for the innovative quality or groundbreaking filmmaking.  For example, after Cousins discussion on Youssef Chahine's film ""Cairo Station"" I watched the film.  While a milestone in Arab film history, I did not find the film all that original in either story or filmmaking technique.  (This is not to say that it is not a good movie.)

After seeing 1,000s of films, Cousins has shown me a new way to view films.  For this reason The Story Of Film is worth the time.",1358553600,2,2753,4.572597137014315

I didn't particularly love the accent of the narrator, that's because I'm an American and would naturally prefer it spoken in a tone most resembling California-speak. On that score, I'd feel the same if it were a thick Southern or Brooklyn accent. However, it's a small price to pay for such a fine educational experience. Also, one of the reviewers complained about the lack of ""expert"" historians and was also upset that the director said things as fact that were just his opinion, such as where a given director got his inspiration for a certain shot. Given the subject is film and not chemistry I have no trouble accepting the director's presumptions. I would find it excruciatingly tedious if half of the film was devoted to more careful phraseology, expressing in precise terms what was his opinion and what was verified fact. My perception is that the filmmakers have studied what came before them and they liberally borrowed.  I may have been more critical had this been one of ten thousand films on the subject, but I've seen nothing of this caliber so far.

general guard-advancing moments in film.

This is done by narration and interviews with examples of films, interviewees and other B-roll clips as backdrop.

It is wrapped in a simple but very effective (and I'd say at times dramatic) music score.

Elegantly presented both on screen and as a package it moves from the late 1800s through 2007, with the film Inception excepted (2010).

Also, chronologically organized into about 1 hour installments.

A look at its Wikipedia page shows a glimpse of what critics said about this work.

At times, the narrator seems to be going around alone with a camera showing places and interviewing people.  This, along with the minimalistic music score strengthens the effect that one does not necessarily need a big production to produce significant and positive  results in a documentary film.

Of note are the interesting B-roll clips that reminds me of my beginnings in photography, when everything was beautiful.  When everything was worth picturing.

This epic production has one significant drawback:  No subtitles.  Something needed at times when Mr. Cousins pronounces certain words, especially those from French.  The Netflix edition had subtitles.

Though I agree and relate to much of what is said in The Story Of Film, I do disagree in certain areas.  Subjectively mostly.  My strongest objection is on Disc 2,  episode 4, time 32 minutes and 47 seconds.  Mr. Cousins is refers to 1940 France and mentions that the Vichy government of France, ""... sided with Hitler...""  This was  not true until 1942 when the Allies invaded North Africa.  However, after playing this section several times I concede I might have misunderstood.  But I'm not yet  sure.

I have watched the whole series about 5 times in Netflix before I could find it no more there.  For this reason, I purchased it:  To watch it again.  And again.

I does take several views to wrap your brain around it.  I'm not there yet.

As a final note, and with respect to the producers I'd submit the proper title would be ""A Story Of Film,' for there are many other stories to be told.
The bad and ugly (Trailer Park Of Terror), the totally weird (Sweet Movie), the documentary world (Ken Burns' The West), epic movies (Carlos), hidden treasures  (Nebraska, Cashback, No Men Beyond This Point, Man With A Movie Camera), movies as a venue to sell products (A View To A Kill) and the like.  Then, there are subjects like the rise and  fall of iconic actors and producers (won't name names), camera and lenses, paste versus digital, etc.

I understand many of those I mention above are beyond the timeframe The Story of Film covers, but I use it to illustrate my opinion:  That it should be A Story and not The Story.
