8219413,4,B000VLPV34,"We purchased this DVD hoping it would show a lot of what these parks offer and wasn't disappointed.  It is the only DVD available about these parks so we don't mind that the quality isn't HD.  Despite the 2 really negative reviews here the quality was better than expected.  Sure, a few of the dark rides are very dark and hard to see at parts inside but that's expected.  You still get a feel of what the ride is like and it sometimes even details what you aren't seeing to give you an understanding of the ride.  We'd rather have that than nothing.  But overall most rides are very visable and it even shows the Queues and details outside of the rides too.  Very informative and there are some very cool rides that Americans have yet to see.  After it was over we felt we had been there.  Any Disney Park fan will appreciate this.

8219414,3,B000VLPV34,"I recently rented this video from Netflix, and thought I'd share some thoughts. I've got a few of the other DVDs that cover Disneyland and Walt Disney World and was interested in seeing this one covering Disneyland Paris and Tokyo DisneySea.

First off, this video isn't a polished commercial documentary like most of the others. It's mainly video taken by people visiting the parks. That doesn't mean that it looks like what your home videos of a park visit might look like. It looks like whoever shot this did it with the intention of making this DVD. The shots tend to be fairly well composed and when there is a sweep of the camera it's usually slow and smooth moving from one item of interest to another. Although this is a DVD, the video quality is more on par with VHS, plus its 4:3 full screen ratio. Not saying the quality is horrible, just that is not HD. The DVD was apparently made in 2007, but I get the feeling that some of the video was shot a few years prior to that - I noticed a poster for the movie ""van helsing"" which was out sometime in 2004.

There are two sections to this DVD, the tour of Disneyland Paris which runs around 1h 30m and the tour of Tokyo DisneySea which is around 1h 10m long. Plus, there are a number of bonus features for both, mainly slideshow of still images. Each section has chapter stops for the individual parts of the video, so that you can quickly jump to a particular part of the tour / park.

The tours are just that, videos of sections of the park. For some of the sections there isn't any sound from the park itself, instead background music has been dubbed in. When the tour is covering an actual ride, the actual sounds are usually present. Other than background music and/or park sounds there isn't any audio - there is no narration for the tours.  I was surprised how well the person who was shooting the video was able to do that while on some of the rides. Most of the dark rides (Phantom Mansion for example) the videos are shot with either a infrared setting or an extreme low-light setting, which makes the videos a bit black and white looking. Again, these are not commercially made videos and were probably not made with the cooperation of the parks - so they have a bit of a primitive look to them. Plus, there are some parts where who ever was editing this video got a bit ""creative"" with the filters to so-so results.

Over all I sort of enjoyed these videos, it was as if someone I knew had visited the park and then created a pretty decent home video for their friends to watch. You do get a sense of what the parks have to offer. One thing I liked compared to the more authorized video tours, is that you get to see parts of the park that they tend to ignore - like the shops and the restaurants.

Having rented this video, I've decided on not buying it right now. If I should ever run across it used or for a price less than what it's currently going for I will buy it for my collection.",1277337600,,2958,4.301615798922801

8219416,1,B000VLPV34,"This DVD is a waste of money, and after you watch it you'll wish you could get the time back too. I could have made a better version of this using the video camera on my cell phone and a few disney movie CDs. It does show you what these parks look like, but it look like someone went to the park with a cell phone camera and tried to be a movie maker. The video quality is horrible and there is no dialog. The free DVD I got from the Disney Vacation planners was better.",1196726400,8,470,3.90625
