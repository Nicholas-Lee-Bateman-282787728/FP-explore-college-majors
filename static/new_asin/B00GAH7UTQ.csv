6068461,5,B00GAH7UTQ,"Fantastic and very personal journey...It feels like you are traveling right along side her. Ms. Lumley is very easy to watch and to listen to. I enjoyed this video even ;more because I have been to Greece,but Ms. Lumley takes you places you could not visit easily on your own. This is not a standard ""How To"" or Travel Video. If you want that ---then nobody does those better than Rick Steves. This is\very personal ,the locations very selective and the experiences attempt to give  more indepth insights into the culture. The photography is gorgeous and so is the music that accompanies the video. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it-especially to those who have already been to Greece. If not, it will whet your appetite to go there!!",1419724800,2,751,4.6893939393939394
6068462,4,B00GAH7UTQ,"Joanna, alluring  voice and grand scenery makes for a luxurious trip.  The film is enjoyable.  A bit annoyed by her view of the gods and no mention of the unknown God is curious.  Of course by all means the great But very broken Acropolis and no mention of the large nearby marble Mars Hill or anything about it...still curiously odd.",1400198400,,334,4.516666666666667
6068463,5,B00GAH7UTQ,"I have always been a big fan of Joanna Lumley with her role on Absolutely Fabulous. As I watched this amazing video I had tears of joy in my eyes. I have been going to Greece since I was fifteen. My heritage is Greek. And I have watched many videos. This is the absolute best. Her commentary is incredible. I learned so much. Things I never knew! An example is a her visit to a particular village where people communicate by whistling to one another!
Whether you are traveling to Greece for the first time or you are a yearly visitor , I highly recommend this video. For someone you know who is in love with Greece, is of Greek heritage this video makes an excellent gift.",1393718400,6,672,4.299212598425197
6068464,5,B00GAH7UTQ,"Joanna Lumley from ""AbFab"" is the most wonderful tour guide. I would love to accompany her on her big adventures. She is fearless, plucky and up for anything the ""Locals"" present to her. She will eat anything, go anywhere by any means, and is delightful and compassionate..",1391212800,3,273,4.829787234042553
6068465,5,B00GAH7UTQ,"Calling all  travelers, armchair and otherwise, to sit back and enjoy the treat of Joanna Lumley's Greek Odyssey!  What a great ""escape"" to have in January, when the cold gray winter keeps one indoors, or for that matter, to view any time that one feels the need to get away to somewhere really interesting.  Just pop in a disc and be whisked off on an adventure hosted by a witty and intelligent guide whose knowledge of and love for Greece is evident in her tour choices.  This is a travel experience that is suitable for all ages, and is full of fascinating places where ancient history and modern life meet.  This would be a helpful DVD in preparing for a trip to Greece, and also a nice reminder of the country if the trip has already been taken.  Joanna Lumley's Greek Odyssey belongs in travel collections, both home and library.",1389571200,5,836,4.54
6068466,5,B00GAH7UTQ,"All things Greek, Western Civilization's beginning locale, seen in modern and 7000-year-old historic modes. City & country--like a travelogue; but more, and done better. It is most delightful when presenter Joanna Lumley meets the local people. Visually exquisite, educationally packed, and entertaining throughout.

SDH SUBTITLES available for all episodes.
1-- The Capital Athens -Parthenon restoration progress -Evia, where natives communicate through the art of whistling -Peloponnese history -Epidaurus 4th Century BC ancient theatre to Olympia to Delphi visiting with an Apollo worshiper. Even a performance by singer Nana Mouskouri.

2-- West island of Corfu to the Eastern Greece border. Invasion history and panorama sights. Lord Byron's highland visit of old. Modern filming of very historic settings.

3-- 1400+ islands make Greece a maritime haven. Lumley sees some of this story, and shares the experience, onboard. Crete has a Nazi resistance history. Kos is Hippocrates birthplace. And even see a volcano up close -too close.

4-- 52 peaks of Mount Olympus with its sporting connections. Thessaloniki history touches back to days of Homer. A grande finale is seeing Monasteries atop stone pillars at Meteora. A Grande Greek Odyssey indeed!

Bonus: Joanna Lumley's text bio.
This series would be good for educational libraries, middle schools and above.
If you like Lumley's presentation, she did an equally successful job on a series called:

8621600,5,B00GAH7UTQ,"The reason we enjoyed this so much was because she shows places and events which we wanted to know more about in a clear and distinct manner. We felt that we were visiting the area in question, both up close and personally, while she interviewed folk living in that particular area who explain what was being done and why they felt it was important.

Well work every penny of the purchase price as well as every moment of the time we spent watching it.",1471910400,,452,4.380952380952381
8621601,5,B00GAH7UTQ,"If you have even the slightest interest in Greece, watch this!!!!! You will want to go there after. Joanna entices the viewer to travel the world in all of her films. Her way with words entrances one into the places she visits. All her travel videos are a must see!",1465171200,,265,4.32

8621603,1,B00GAH7UTQ,This isn't a travelogue or documentary.  It is just random video from what is apparently the most boring day of the actress's vacation.  Completely worthless.  The last third of the video is an off the cuff visit into the house of a really old lady they just happened upon.  No value to me.  I'm not planning to visit the home of a frail 90 year old random stranger who speaks no English.,1447459200,,388,4.333333333333333

8621605,4,B00GAH7UTQ,"Greece, has been in the news more often in the past few years because of their financial miseries and bankruptcy. That does not deter us however, from enjoying the richness of it's culture and history. It has given us democracy, drama, science, philosophy, medicine, and the Muses. In this series of four episodes, Joanna Lumley, the English actress, visits the Parthenon, Delphi, Mount Olympus, Crete, and other major sites. We are also privy to her visits off the major sites, where we are able to view the country from the voices and eyes of the people. Each episode is about 45 minutes,with beautiful photography.

We started at the Parthenon. It took 10 years to build the temple, and it is going through an extensive renovation as we are to see. Joanna was taken to the top of the Acropolis via construction steps and open ladders, she has vertigo, and this was difficult for her. However, we get to see the slow laborious work. Off to a small island, Evia,where people communicate via whistles. This was one of the most unusual occurrences. At the theatre of Epidaurus, Greek singing legend Nana Mouskouri, sang Ave Maria with the most wonderful acoustics in the deep open theatre.

Off to the island of Corfu and the eastern border that Greece shares with Turkey and Bulgaria, Joanna visits a military outpost, which she tells us took months to set up. The she retraces Lord Byron's journey by horseback through the western highlands, and hears a story from one of the last known survivors of a horrific slaughter of most of his people. Greece has more than 1,400 islands, and it seems each has its own tales to tell. Joanna visits Crete and learns of its role in the Resistance against the Nazis. The travel to Kos, was one if the most fascinating stops for me. It is the birthplace of Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine.

The last episode features Mount Olympus, home of the ancient gods. We see a modern day marathon, with athelete's who run up the mountain. Joanna visitsThessaloniki, attends a fortune-telling festival, and ends her journey in Meteora, where monasteries perch on sandstone pillars in the sky.

This Greek Odyssey was informative and picturesque, I did not enjoy but as much as I did the trip to the Nile. Joanna Lumley has a most wonderful voice, however, and is a marvelously entertaining travel guide.
