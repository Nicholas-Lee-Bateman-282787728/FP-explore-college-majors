8016843,4,B0001W69AW,I got this as part of a sci-fi mega pack. A better plot than Westworld. Jack Palance played a villain with depth. A government would want to test soldiers with an advanced computer simulation that tests and trains recruits. Don't think it would burn out you brain-that's just a hack plot device.,1443225600,,295,4.6923076923076925
8016844,1,B0001W69AW,"A group of people dressed as slaves find themselves suddenly transferred to an old west town with no memory of who they are. They have cards which claim they are killers. They are captured and placed in scenarios where they must kill to survive. Killing is done under rules. Michael Lewis ( Keir Dullea ) is the main character. He emerges from the group and the controllers of the game take a special interest in him.

Mean while the real body of Michael Lewis is laying down and is wired up. Considering that movies have come out with similar themes, better effects, and better scripts, I wouldn't waste a lot of money on this one. It is available on poorly transferred DVD sci-fi collections.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. One quick on screen love scene and one off screen rape.",1351296000,,789,4.588652482269503
8016845,5,B0001W69AW,"I found this movie in a DVD boxset in the bargain bin in Walmart.  It was some kind of Western Kill'em All kinda movie (in the surface).  However, it was very similar to Total Recall and The Matrix (in western).  And this movie was surprisingly entertaining with good acting and story.

So go dig in out from the bargain bin in Walmart.",1213142400,,336,4.370967741935484
