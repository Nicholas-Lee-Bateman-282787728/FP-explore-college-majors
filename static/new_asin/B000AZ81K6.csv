8081151,5,B000AZ81K6,"I felt that the menus were easy to follow.  The different levels are great, as I am a novice.  The different music selections are also great, and I found all of them to be relaxing, and helpful in achieving the goal of the program. The demonstrators in the DVD appear to be very committed to what they are teaching.  Overall, it is the best yoga DVD I have experienced.  Kudos to all involved.",1129075200,3,393,4.342465753424658
