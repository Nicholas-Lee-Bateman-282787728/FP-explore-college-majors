605616,5,6303213782,"An honest attempt to retrace the ambitious, youthful, and often turbulent times of a band that would alter the course of music as we have come to know it.  A tall order indeed, because we fans love the Beatles and all of us key on certain ideas, beliefs, myths, along with our own perspectives of how we want our boys perceived.  This movie came pretty close in capturing the Fab Four's youth and raw vitality while in their prime.  We get a glimpse early on in their career honing their skills, living life's challenges before their unprecedented success and popularity.  This movie was a must see for me, and is a part of my study of everything about them. Having said all that, the acting, and yes; the music was superb and very believable.  I enjoyed this film for it's content and intended purpose, and also for the boost to my imagination, and memories of those four lads from Liverpool that rocked the world.",1459296000,2,915,4.554878048780488

605739,3,6303213782,"This is not a film for any Beatles fan who is well educated on the band and the individuals in it. The details are there, however, the execution of the cast is not. I am a firm believer that if a biopic of the most famous group in history is to be made, it should be made correctly. This is NOT a film about the Beatles during their Hamburg days, it merely serves as a backdrop for the story of Stu. Yes, he was a small part of the band but his individual story is not near interesting enough to fill a full length movie. The production value, direction, and acting is good though the casting is frustrating and almost laughable.

605796,5,6303213782,"This is a very good movie presenting the crucial years that The Beatles spent in Hamburg, when they met Astrid Kircherr and Klaus Vormann. You also get to meet Stu Suthcliffe, who was such a close friend of John Lennon's.",1355529600,,221,4.55
605797,2,6303213782,"I had seen the movie twice, when it had first come out, and was rather impressed.  BUT, then, over the next many years, I have read nearly everything I could find about the early Beatles years, and Stu, Astrid, Klaus, etc.  (I have not read the book by Stu's sister, and probablly won't.)

'Backbeat' is sort of like the 'Harry Potter' movies; they are sort of well done, and sort of fun and easy to watch, (an hour or so of watching, rather than hours and hours of reading...) BUT the HP movies are often SO different from the books.  Now, we can easily compare the HP books and movies, there they both are...it is WAY less easy to compare the 'Backbeat' movie, and all the books about Stu and the early Beatles; and too much is too different.

Stu was already OUT of the band when they did the 'My Bonnie' recording.  The Beatles had a much different sound than the movie group does.  The Beatles went home seprately at the end of the first trip. The move to the 'Top Ten' was on their second trip.  Stu had many, many attacks of headaches while living at Atrids home (and probably NEVER attacked Klaus and Astrid!!!).  He died on the way to the hospital in her arms.  Etc, etc, etc...  The 'real' story, as best we can figure it out from many books is already a very real, very eventful, VERY emotional story.  Why did the 'Backbeat' crew need to change so much?

After watching the Harry Potter movies once or twice, you almost forget that they are INCORRECT, and you forget the REAL stories of the books.  After watching 'Backbeat' once or a few too many times, you might start thinking that this really happened.

A mostly fun movie, but too often too far from what probably really happened.  It is a fantasy, NOT a documentary!!!",1353974400,3,1736,4.411949685534591
605798,5,6303213782,"Even though most people know some of the story of the Beatles, the acting and direction in this film will rivet you to your seat. Keep an eye out for Ian Hart (John Lennon), who also appears in Clockwork Mice and Hollow Reed. Arguably one of the most believable actors around.",1353196800,,276,4.431372549019608
605799,5,6303213782,"This one will fascinate. David Grohl is behind the music. There's alot of David fans out there. This soundtrack rocks. This movie is visually stunning. Ian Hart is a perfect John Lennon. Stephen Dorff plays Stuart Suttecliffe. Sheryl Lee plays the ultimate swinging sixties bird, Astrid. Full of fun and the sixties. Rimbaud strikes again. This is a must have in your rock n roll movie collection.",1346803200,,397,4.940298507462686
605800,4,6303213782,"This relatively obscure film scratched out a couple million dollars in 1994 and never received proper acclaim.  British director and co-writer Iain Softley researched the early days of the Beatles for years which led him to their first significant gig in Hamburg, Germany.  His research led him to German artist Astrid Kirchher who played a major role in the emergence of the famous band.  This is not a typical biopic of the early Beatles although they are all present.

The story is about the 5th Beatle, Stuart Sutcliffe (a remarkable performance by Stephen Dorff, ""Immortals"") and his relationship with his best friend John Lennon (Ian Hart, ""Harry Potter"" films) and Kirchher (Sheryl Lee, ""Winter's Bone"").  Sutcliffe and Lennon were best friends and through John's urging, Stuart joins the band put together by Lennon and Paul McCartney (Gary Bakewell) that included George Harrison (Chris O'Neill) and Pete Best (Scot Williams).  Sutcliffe by his own admission wasn't a very good musician and a terrible singer.  His heart was in painting.  He wasn't interested in a musical career as Lennon was.

While playing in a notorious strip club called the Kaiserkeller, The Beatles came to the attention of photographer Kirchher and her lover at the time, Klaus Voormann (Kai Wiesinger), a musician, artist and producer.  After Sutcliffe is invited into their circle, the rift between him and the rest of the band widens.  Sutcliffe eventually supplants Voormann as Astrid's lover and fianc.  Hart's Lennon is an angry young man and as the story progresses it is clear that he is jealous of both Sutcliffe, for his catch of Kirchher who he clearly is also attracted, and of Kirchher who he sees as coming between him and his best friend. Alas, Sutcliffe's life ends abruptly in 1962 from a brain hemorrhage at the age of 21.

Softley took a great risk in casting this wonderful picture.  It was shot in England and Germany with a British cast but for the 2 leads.  Unhappy with his options in Europe, Softley went to L. A. and was taken with the unknown 18 year old Dorff.  He then signed Cheryl Lee (6 years older) who was probably best known for being the dead girl on TV's ""Twin Peaks.""  Dorff adopts a perfect Liverpool accent and Lee does a remarkably authentic German.  Kirchher who acted as a consultant on the film commented that Dorff's cadence and mannerisms were scary good.

There are several lengthy American rock `n roll covers that The Beatles perform during the film and I thought they sounded very good but clearly weren't Beatles voices.  It turns out Softley assembled a band of American musicians to play the songs mimicked by the actors.  The band included Dave Grohl of ""Nirvana,"" Henry Rollins from ""Black Flag,"" Mike Mills of ""R.E.M."" and Thurston Moore of ""Sonic Youth,"" among others.  This is an overlooked but extraordinary look at the early Beatles filled with great music, solid performances and a provocative love story.",1346803200,,2950,4.92914979757085
605801,5,6303213782,I look forward to seeing this DVD. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet though. Thanks again for the DVD.,1328659200,,107,3.909090909090909
605802,5,6303213782,"Os Beatles alm de todos os mritos de criatividade, inovao, tiveram outros, entre esses mritos est o fato de terem percorrido um caminho que acabou virando paradigma para muitas bandas.

Nem todos percorreram esse caminho, mas com certeza foi o sonho de todos.

605803,5,6303213782,"This is a movie I enjoyed a lot when it first came out. I'm not a hardcore fan of The Beatles, more of a casual fan, and tend to like John Lennon's post-Beatle work more than The Beatles. ""Backbeat"" is the back story of The Beatles before they made it big. A pre-history of The Beatles. ""Backbeat"" starts where last year's ""Nowhere Boy"" leaves off. The years The Beatles went to Hamburg, Germany playing dank clubs in cellars and learned how to play rock `n' roll.

Liverpool art students and best friends John Lennon (Ian Hart) and Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff) take the proto-Beatles Paul McCartney (Gary Bakewell), George Harrison (Chris O'Neill), and Pete Best (Scot Williams) to Hamburg. In Germany The Beatles resembled more of a punk band than The Beatles that later became famous. They dress in leathers, they're introduced to speed, and their playing is more ragged and raucous. One of the points of contention between McCartney and Lennon is Sutcliffe's lack of ability in playing the bass guitar, but since Sutcliffe is Lennon's best mate Sutcliffe stays in the band. Soon after arriving, Sutcliffe meets Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl Lee), and several love triangles develop between the characters. The triangle that receives the main focus of ""Backbeat"" is between Lennon, Sutcliffe, and Kirchherr, then the close relationship between Lennon and Sutcliffe, and the more subtle love triangle of Lennon, The Beatles and the pull of fame and recognition Lennon craved. All pull with equal gravity on Lennon and Sutcliffe.

Hart as John Lennon disappears into the role he makes a believable Lennon without it falling into impersonation or parody. While not many people were familiar with Sutcliffe before ""Backbeat"" in the special features section of the DVD are pictures of Sutcliffe and Dorff looks remarkably like Sutcliffe. Dorff was about the same age as Sutcliffe when he made this movie, and due to the enormous input of Astrid Kirchherr to the movie it would be safe to assume Dorff has the same handle on Sutcliffe as Hart has on Lennon. Sheryl Lee also plays Kirchherr very subtly. She seems shy but her influence on Sutcliffe's life visibly grows during the course of the film, and the conclusion seems preordained to us. As the movie ends we fill in the blanks. It's the point where the historic Beatles begin and almost everyone knows (or thinks they know) the history of The Beatles.

A lot of attention seems to have been paid to the details of both the era and the relationships of the person's involved. As we discover in the special features director Iain Softley developed the screenplay with a lot of input from Astrid Kirchherr. Softley admits that some things have been changed for dramatic purposes but nothing that changes the overall story or the characters.

The special features include an interview with Astrid Kirchherr, that her relationship with Sutcliffe, and includes photographs of Sutcliffe and his paintings. There are two interviews with director Iain Softley the first at Sundance which tells a lot about how he developed ""Backbeat"" with the input of Kirchherr. The second interview with Softley and Hart is a little redundant in places because Softley reiterates how he came to make ""Backbeat."" The commentary is rather minimalist in approach and you can easily watch the movie around it.

As I mentioned ""Backbeat"" carries on where ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nowhere-Boy/dp/B0036TGT5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nowhere Boy</a>"" left off. Although these two movies weren't conceived as such and were made 16 years apart, they make nice companion pieces and fit nicely together in the Lennon/Beatles story.",1294272000,3,3696,5.194630872483222
605857,5,6303213782,"I saw the film when it was first released to VHS and welcomed it to my collection of rock related films.  I've been waiting for the DVD since,  and I found it yesterday.  The extra features on the DVD, version including interviews makes it even better.  I consider it a masterpiece of rock documentary.  I highly recommend it to those not easily offended by honest sexual content... I was glad to hear in the included interview material that Cynthia Lennon was so pleased with the film that she brought Julian to see it so as to better understand his father. Excellent story development, casting, and attention to detail.  As to long tall Sally, sorry Sir Paul.. we know you still rock.",1287187200,3,686,4.628099173553719
605858,3,6303213782,"I have seen this movie now several times and this 'back story' (meaning Stu's story) is well acted. It shows the real friendship John & Stu shared between them. I have often wondered if much of John's anger was a result of the two people he was closest too- Julia & Stu  passing out of his life so early and so young?

This film provides great insight into Stu's art career as well, had he lived Stu would of certainly been as famous as Andy Warhol and others of his generation. (check out his work online). It may of well been Stu instead of Klaus doing the creative Revolver cover.

I do have one problem with this film- its treatment of Cynthia Lennon (John's first wife). At the time of this movie she was enrolled in Liverpool Art College-with John & Stu, and was studying to teach art (Both she and Stu tried to help Lennon pass his art school exams to no luck). Why people feel the need to portray Cynthia as ""i just want to marry John & have babies'is lost on me.

Lennon's first marriage (like Lennon himself) was a victim of his fame- like many couples, John & Cyn simply became strangers to one another due to John's work. Add into that John's increasing drug use & constant skirt chasing and you have the perfect recipe for divorce. John was married to two wonderfully creative and intelligent women whom loved him. They should BOTH be portrayed that way.",1286668800,2,1367,4.412698412698413

AVOID THIS FILM LIKE THE PLAGUE UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE AN UNBELIEVABLY SLANDEROUS, SUPERFICIAL AND BANAL MOVIE. THE SADDEST THING IS THAT PEOPLE WILL SEE THIS FILM AND THINK THIS IS AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF SUTCLIFFE AND OF LENNON, WHICH IT IS NOT. ONE OF THE WORST THINGS ABOUT THIS FILM IS A BRUTAL FIGHT SCENE THAT IS ENTIRELY UNTRUE AND FABRICATED AND HAS NOT ONE OUNCE OF TRUTH TO IT. IT SHOWS SUTCLIFFE BEATING UP A FRIEND OF HIS GIRLFRIEND, IN A JEALOUS RAGE. SUTCLIFFE WAS GENTLE AND NONVIOLENT,ACCORDING TO QUOTES BY EVERYONE WHO KNEW HIM INCLUDING LENNON AND HARRISON IN REAL LIFE, AND THIS FABRICATED UNTRUE SCENE MAKES HIM SEEM LIKE A MONSTER.
THE FILM MAKES LENNON SEEM LIKE A WHINNY HOMOPHOBIC ANGRY MESS, AND THERE IS NO DELVING INTO WHY LENNON AND SUTCLIFFE WERE SO COMPATIBLE AND DEEPLY CLOSE AND CARING FRIENDS. SUTCLIFFE WAS A GENTLE ARTIST, HE SOON TIRED OF THE ROCK AND ROLL LIFE, AND WAS A DEEP THINKER, INTELLIGENT, AND CARING AND ANY BIO BOOK ON HIM CLEARLY STATES THAT, AND HIS FRIENDS AND THE BEATLES HAVE MADE MANY QUOTES ABOUT HIS TRUE FASCINATING CHARACTER. THIS FILM IS RUBBISH AND MAKES HIM OUT TO BE A JERK WITH NO REASON TO BE A MOODY JERK.
THE PERFORMANCE BY DORFF AND IAN HART ARE GREAT, BUT THE SCREENPLAY IS GARBAGE. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE,

605860,3,6303213782,"I am glad I bought this movie. Like anyone else (and like any Beatles fan), I am willing and even anxious to see and understand the exact moment preceding the outburst of an incredible journey, especially The Beatles one. Also, the topic is particularly interesting: Stuart Sutckiffe's life and personality and especially his (oh so early) death gave that ""tragic dimension"" to the Beatles story, dimension which had a certain contribution to the rising myth and added some poignant enigma to the whole picture--ingredients that emphasized the impact on their addicted audiences.

Some of the achievements of this movie are its accuracy, faithfulness to reality and therefore good documentation. The atmosphere in the 1960-1962 Liverpool/Hamburg is well rendered, the screenplay is truthful, the sets and image are great (in some scenes, we recognize postures and mimic from the photographs taken by the German ""exies"" Astrid, Jrgen and Klaus--and I do not refer to the ""pose to be photographed"" scenes.) I particularly appreciated the Fab Four reconstruction: perfect, despite the physical non-resemblance (we forgive George's blue eyes, for instance). Their voices, posture and gestures on the stage are well-documented and strikingly well rendered. (One big exception: in real life, it's Paul who sings Long Tall Sally, not John!). The early Beatle sound is not reproduced but recreated to be better understood by us, not-so-contemporary audience. John's character is exceptionnaly well acted and seized, his violence, warmth, coldness, wit, cynicism, despair, raw force and strong will are consistent and intense. Well done!

The less convincing parts of the movie are the main characters: Stu (whose personality is vague, diluted, fuzzy, the actor being all the time  la recherche du personnage) and Astrid who is a caricature--poorly acted, posing, precious and boring. The love scenes are too long, out of focus and thus utterly unnecessary. It's a pity. This movie could have been a masterpiece.

I watch the movie now and then for the atmosphere, the Fab Four and the songs. I skip the Stu-Astrid scenes. Oh, well!",1256256000,3,2123,5.3283582089552235

""Backbeat"" is a nice depiction of the Beatles' beginnings and, by no means coincidentally, their first exposure to the power of media, as Astrid's photos did much in 1963-1964 to establish the tough soulful qualities of the Fab Four. Much better than we had any right to expect, and it ages well, despite the fact that it was...gasp...46 years ago today when Johnnie Lennon got his band to play.",1254700800,,670,4.982142857142857

The two things that stuck out to me was that Paul was too tall and it sounded nothing like John singing when they were on stage. At least Paul sounded like Paul when he was singing. Besides that, they did a really good job. Stephen Dorff is great as Stuart, but I think the best parts were the scenes of John and Paul talking to each others, that's what we really want to see.

605942,5,6303213782,"This is the story of the early trials and tribulations of John Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe, art students and rock musicians from Liverpool.  They were scrappy trouble-makers when they formed the Beatles with Paul, George, and Pete Best and went to play in the shabby strip clubs of Hamburg, hoping to make a name for themselves.  There, Stuart met and fell in love with photographer Astrid  Kirchherr.  Although he was very close to John, Stuart chose to leave the group and stay with Astrid, just before the Beatles released their first record.

Ian Hart (Quirrell in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer-s-Stone/dp/B000W74EQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a>) gives an explosive performance as John Lennon.  Being a native of Liverpool, Hart gets the accent right and conveys John's scruffy, irreverent attitude and love of music.  American actor Stephen Dorff does a good job as the sensitive, doomed Stuart.  None of the actors look much like their characters, but they do project a believable image of the group.

The songs (none of which are by Lennon-McCartney) were sung by members of established bands such as REM.  The sleazy locations in Liverpool and Hamburg contribute to the rag-tag feeling of the movie.  In spite of ample profanity and nudity, this is a movie that Beatles fans will enjoy, and the DVD has many interesting extras.",1213056000,8,1450,5.575342465753424
605943,3,6303213782,"...it's worth a viewing.  Here's what's good about the movie, the acting is pretty high quality, the story is interesting, about the Beatles before they became famous, and were a band of teenagers tearing up this new rock'n roll music in Liverpool then Hamburg.  It's a fun watch for Beatle's fans, an educational look into an earlier period of music for those too young to know the Beatles outside of hearing them nowadays in the supermarket.  What's best about the movie is the soundtrack, someone recruited some of the best talent out of 90's grunge rock bands and these 4 guys do a simply amazing job of recapturing the early Beatles.  You can comopare if you want, there are recordings of the pre-famous Hamburg era Beatles, but they are of very poor audio quality, so this soundtrack is much better.  Now, the negative.  There are two ways you can go if you're casting a movie about the Beatles, either find actors who look like they did, or find actors who are musicians who can pull off acting like they're actually playing their instruments (I don't know wny this should be so hard, Denzel Washington could to it, but most actors can't).  Well, the people casting this movie didn't do either, so a big shortcoming for me was that 1)the actors look so little like the real Beatles, many Beatles fans aren't going to be able to get beyond this, and 2) the actors aren't convincing when they are performing, in other words, you can't watch too closely when they're on stage or you'll notice that they don't look like they're actually playing their instruments.  I know, that doesn't bug everyone, but musicians often get get past this, so... for the most serious of Beatles fans, and those of you who are musicians, I'm going to recommend you get the soundtrack instead, everyone should like that.",1212364800,,1803,4.701587301587302
605944,3,6303213782,"Riding a voracious roller-coaster and watching Ian Softley's ""Backbeat"" could be considered one in the same.  From the excitement of the opening credits, to the lackluster conversations between infamous Beatle John Lennon and former-band member Stuart Sutcliffe in Liverpool, to the empowering nights of playing music in Hamburg, to the clich drama over a girl named Astrid, to the emotional true formation of the Beatles, this film should have a subtext that it could, if viewed in one sitting, cause stomach butterflies or cramps.  With Softley's eye, the audience is strapped in tightly as ""Backbeat"" goes up and down, left and right, in and out of darkness, and in the end all you are left with is a perturbed expression captured on an invisible camera.  There is no argument that the Beatles have secured their names in worldly culture, and that there is plenty of information covering each living minute of these Brits, AND that the story of Stuart Sutcliffe is an interesting tale about a man who chose love and art versus screaming women and super-stardom, but this critic still winced a couple of times during this 100+ minute semi-biopic.  Like the music of the Beatles, Softley has amazing scenes filled with emotion and pizzazz, but where he slips is his focus on our central character, Stuart Sutcliffe.  One must ask the question, is this film about the choices of Sutcliffe, or is it just another chapter about the Beatles and their rise to popularity?

With equal screen time being shared between crucial friendship Lennon and Sutcliffe, the argument can be set that Softley struggles with who to allow the camera to capture, the charismatic Ian Hart (giving us a fresh face to Mr. Lennon), or the subdue and forced accent of Stephen Dorff playing Sutcliffe.  For this critic, an entire film based off Hart's performance, or seen through Hart's Lennon's eyes would have been sheer icing on Softley's cake, but since we were forced to stifle through Dorff's performance - we are stuck with him, and where this film ultimately suffered.  What makes this roller-coaster worth perhaps riding a second time is Softley's ability to cast stronger secondary characters that seem more viewable than our front and center players.  Gary Bakewell's McCartney is perfection, while O'Neill, Williams, and whoever played Astrid's original lover were complete eye-candy.  Each actor grew their characters further than the page, and used this film as a showcase for their talent.  ""Backbeat"" is worth the rental for the sheer background characters alone, and for Hart's John Lennon, but our central characters, Sutcliffe and Astrid, seemed clich-ly perfect, too instantaneous in love, and at times purely fake.  What forces me to say this are the scenes that the two (Dorff and Lee) share together.  While the art they create is full of passion, the chemistry that they share is not.  The 60s were a different time, a time where I was nowhere in existence, but this film was made in 1994 - giving off an impression that certain liberties were taken to tell their story.  Softley is too generous with these two - giving us no reality to base them in.  While the 60s were carefree in nature, where does Astrid stumble upon the castle in which she lives?  Money seems of no concern, and it is confusing (with no pre-story) how easily Sutcliffe can give up his best friend's band and the random disasters that can be caused at German limbo parties.  If this were a true story of simply Sutcliffe, than we would have followed his eyes, intermixed with the Beatles as a cameo, and really seen his artwork.  It isn't until the final act of this film that his artwork gets any recognition, which again makes it difficult to understand Sutcliffe's tangent rational.

Enough with the negative; what was engrossing about this film?  ""Backbeat"", while playing to typical biopic clichs, still maintained a level of entertainment.  The songs would walk in and catch your toes tapping along.  Softley used American songs to give the Beatles that sense of ""cool"" as well as to demonstrate how well they performed on stage.  Their energy, both the actual Beatles, as well as Ian Hart and his group had enough energy for anyone watching this film.  They were charismatic, exciting, and destined to be stars.  This was obvious from the beginning, the Beatles did it all themselves by performing eight days a week, with little to no food or sleep.  They captured the essence of ""grunge"".  For me, that was enough to continue with this film from beginning to end.  Sutcliffe's artwork, because it was so thinly used in the film, was exciting to see as well.  The same can be said for Astrid's photography.  The Beatles' art (both music and printed) was brilliant, these characters were brilliant in their lives, but I just felt like Softley dumb-ed them down for audiences.  The final act was pure rubbish, again with the opportunity to see Sutcliffe do his work - yet limbo miserably, that it nearly sours the remaining moments of this film.  Outside of the story, flawed as it was, Softley and his cinematographer should be fully credited for the roller-coaster sensation felt throughout the film.  There were breath-taking scenes throughout the movie, but they were typically anchored by choppy editing.  There would be this great scene of Astrid looking at the band that would steal your breath, and then we would jump to the band - in what felt like a different filming ratio, and then back to Astrid.  It felt like the audience was saying, ""Ohhh ... urgggg .... Ohhhh"".

Overall, ""Backbeat"" was an entertaining film, in fact, it stands above the mediocre level of entertainment to say that I could view this movie a second time - but it would be with much argument and comments through the peanut gallery throughout.  The music stands out, Softley defines the time perfectly (almost as if anyone who could carry a tune could swoon those German women), but he cannot define his characters.  This is a biopic, in the short sense of the word, about Stuart Sutcliffe, yet the audience watches nearly equal screen time between he and John Lennon.  While I agree Lennon's influence on Sutcliffe and their friendship is worth the film reel it is printed on, I do not believe it fully grasps the art and lifestyle that Sutcliffe embodied.  With a hodgepodge of beautiful scenes, why couldn't Softley use that tricky camera work to define Sutcliffe's art - to make his art the second main character?  Ian Hart gave a phenomenal, hands-down, performance as Lennon, and a whole film could have been made about him - but Softley's film cannot support both - so they both suffer.  Upon finishing this film, one cannot truly say they knew Sutcliffe at all - outside of the catastrophic ending and the tacky final words as they play in the ocean.  ""Backbeat"" was an entertaining two hours, but not worth a second repeat.

605977,4,6303213782,"""Backbeat"" provides a fascinating and alternative viewpoint of the pre-stardom Beatles. Ian Hart's jealous, sarcastic, and insecure Lennon is both fresh yet seemingly correct. Liverpool and Hamburg lay at either ends of the bridge between the sappy 50's and avant-garde 60s, and the film moves us across that bridge at the frenetic and raucous pace of the cover tunes of the then-Beatles' playlist. Hart and the actors playing McCartney and Harrison bear a less superficial and more unnerving resemblance to the young Beatles, certainly not in the way of a Vegas revue, and all the better for it. It's probably a good thing though that Stu Sutcliffe quit the band, if quite a sad thing he died so young.

Although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of ""fifth Beatle"" Stuart Sutcliffe, the focus quickly shifts to John Lennon who (as in real life) dominated the music and lives of the early Beatles.  It is as much the story of Stu and John as the story of Stu and Astrid, and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships.  Still, it is a fascinating look at the early Beatles, who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough Reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years.  The cast is excellent, and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed.  The music is also excellent, and complements the story perfectly.

605979,3,6303213782,"Pretty good movie of the Beatles' early years - particularly of their beginnings in Hamburg, Germany.  None of their original music, however; producers probably couldn't pay for that.  The story is really about a fifth member, Stuart Sutcliffe, a gifted artist who died at 21 in Hamburg with his wife, a German photographer, who gave the remaining Beatles their mop-top look. Sutcliffe, or the actor who plays him, Stephen Dorff, an American, kind've resembles James Dean, but without his intensity.  One reviewer states that he was Britain's most promising young artist before he died of a brain hemorrhage, probably brought on by a fight back in Liverpool because of something John Lennon said.  The movie doesn't say whether Lennon knew this or not.  It also seems to imply that Lennon was bi-sexual.  He certainly felt strongly about Stu; but it also implies that he could have loved Stu's wife.  I could never really get into this movie; maybe because I was never that crazy about the Beatles' music.  And only the actor who played Paul McCartney in any way resembled the Beatle he was playing.

Ian Hart had done a gread job, I think. He acted very well of young Lennon's potential charisma, confusing, and uncontrolled great passion to music and friends.

Needless to say, This movie is about Stuart Sutcliffe who is a member of Beatles in the begining and short time but influenced very much on their fashon and appearance. He is also a very talented painter. But John Lennon is such a great icon that seemed to make anything go away except him.

When the movie ended what remained in my mind was that Lennon's guilt. How he had been feeling with his best friend and his future. Actually accoring to his biography he had been feeling a guilt to Stuart's death. I realized that how Lennon was a huge human being that may cause his death, even though I don't like very much the Beatles' sound.",1135296000,3,1077,4.343283582089552

605982,4,6303213782,"Before The Beatles changed the world of music, they were a scruffy rock 'n' roll five piece. Lennon and McCartney were already writing music together but Lennon spent much of his time hanging with fellow artist Stu Sutcliffe. Lennon talked his pal into spending the money from the sale of a painting into buying a bass guitar and suddenly ""The Silver Beatles"" had a new bassist--albeit one that couldn't play any instrument but that soon changed.

This terrific film chronicles the early days of the band in Hamburg before they broke it big and the strong friendship of Lennon and Sutcliffe. Ian Hart virtually steals the film from Stephen Dorf (who's also quite good)capturing Lennon's swagger and sarcastic wit in full stride. Directly Ian Softley focuses more on the duo of Lennon and Sutcliffe than the rest of the band chronicling their friendship. Sutcliffe never lived to see Lennon and the rest of the band achieve their dreams of going to the top and conquer the world. It's a fascinating glimpse into the past and it's clear that Softley did quite a bit of research to make this marvelous film. Hart had played Lennon once before in ""The House and Times"" a film that portrayed a supposed homosexual fling between Lennon and the band's manager Brian Epstein.

Most of the performances capture the essence of the The Beatles even if they don't always look exactly like the people their playing. The duo Hart and Gary Bakewell at least resemble Lennon and McCartney. While Softley claims he was trying to capture the raw sound of the band in the beginning (which I'm sure he does), my only complaint is that the singers don't sound all that much like Lennon or McCartney. Still, the supporting musicians drawn from members of REM, Afgan Wigs, Nirvana and other groups do create quite a sound.

The big difference between this and the bare bones release of a couple of years ago are all the extras: We get Ian Softley's ""Sundance Channel Interview""; an interview of Softley and Hart discussing the making of the film; an audio interview with Astrid Kirchherr (with old photos of her, Stu and others along with footage from the film to illustrate what she's saying); two deleted scenes; footage of ""the band"" of actors rehearshing; audition video shot for the movie; behind-the-scenes photos and an audio commentary from the director. Univeral has done an exceptional job in remastering the video and audio.

The anamorphic widescreen images (1.85:1) seem about the same as on the 2003 disc, good but sometimes grainy. Other extras, duped from the old DVD, include a director's commentary, a pair of deleted scenes and various interviews that tend to repeat material. Packaging is a lot classier than on the old DVD.

""Backbeat"" takes the time to let its bogus Beatles perform entire numbers, mostly soul covers. The real music came from a ""grunge"" supergroup put together for the film by producer Don Was. The new 5.1 audio sounds sensational, with a vibrant and musical surround stage.

Director Iain Softley (""K-PAX"") tells how he spent six years researching and writing the project, inspired by stylish photos he saw of Kirchherr and her lover Stu Sutcliffe, the Beatles' first bass player. The ""Backbeat"" script was based on her recollections; it focuses on the couple and jealous guy John Lennon.

People see what they want to see, I guess, but I didn't see that at all in this wonderful movie.  Sure, the John Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe characters experience a deep felt ""love"" for each other, but love in a non-sexual sense.  A man can feel intense love for another man (or a woman for another woman, a mother and daughter for instance)and it doesn't have to be (nor is it usually) sexual.  Maybe it takes a quite a few years to realize it, but sexual love is really the weakest kind of love out there.  Sexual love often boils down to nothing more than lust, and the friendship between John Lennon and Stuart Sutcliffe that is portrayed in BACKBEAT is in a world apart from than that.

A synopsis of this movie is: John Lennon convinces Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff), an art school friend, to join his band as a bass player. The band gets a chance at a professional gig, and off they go to Hamburg. The other band members are bewildered as to why John insists that such a relatively untalented muscian as Stuart Suttcliffe is in the band in the first place. Paul wants to kick Suttcliffe off the band, which results in a confrontation with John, who threatens to quit the band if Suttcliffe is asked to leave. ""What is it with you two,"" asked a truely bewildered Paul. In the meantime, Sutcliffe, meets Astrid (Sheryl Lee), a bohemian photographer, who encourages him to pursue his interest in painting.  John and Astrid spar over Suttcliffe's affection.  After a violent confrontation with Stuart over Asrid, John finally accepts that Stuart is leaving him, and gets on with his life.

One might venture to ask WHY a movie that is supposed to be about the early Beatles has a plot revolving around the relationship between John Lennon and Stuart Suttcliffe?

Stuart Suttcliffe, 'the 5th Beatle' is actually a bit of trivia in the story of the Beatles.  On the other hand, it's a key to understanding who John Lennon was.

This is a love story between two men, BEFORE the relatively NEW and rigid concept of orientation was established in the Sexual Revolution of the 70's and 80's. The fact that the intimacy between Lennon and Suttcliffe was never 'consumated' in an actual sex act doesn't detract from the powerful affection between them.  It was just the way things were before Gay Liberation.

606063,5,6303213782,"I came across this movie at a local VC sell-out. It turned out to be  the first feature movie about the Beatles I ever enjoyed. Well I never! The general idea, the team or actors, the sound of 60s and even the Liverpool accent spoken, all in all produced that penetrating feeling of  those times gone once and back again on the screen. Really touching and marvellous stuff!",1017014400,5,373,4.470588235294118
606064,4,6303213782,"Backbeat is a raunchy glimpse into the world of a Rock 'n Roll band in the making. Even though this movie is set before The Beatles were famous, it holds a distinction not far from the grunge holes and influences modern day rockers get their starts. If you're tired of hearing the numerous ""Fab Saints"" portrayal of the group, this is for you. It is hardcore, authentic, engaging, and retrospective look that passes as if it happened today. You'll miss Ringo, but a look at Stu Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, his death, and the former Pete Best on drums bring the story before Ringo to life. Astrid Kirchherr and Klaus Voorman are vividly portrayed in this wild ride of the early years. The Beatles...bad as they wanna be...",1010620800,6,731,4.71875
606065,3,6303213782,"This movie is okay--at least there's a minimal resemblance to the real people.  Based on what I've read about the Beatles over the years-there seems to be a bit of revisionism in this movie--examples are Stu Sutcliffe mentioning ""8 days a week"" and John, ""A Hard Days Night"" even though Paul says a taxi driver gave him the words, ""8 days a week"" and Ringo is credited with ""A Hard Days Night"" as one of his more famous malapropisms. Despite these type incidents-the movie is still fairly enjoyable, although it's really the Stu and Astrid story with a lot of John Lennon.  Paul to a slight degree and George and Pete are treated as insignificant characters.  Still, it's worth watching if your a Beatle buff/",982195200,3,709,4.656
606066,4,6303213782,"All the best musical documentary-based films succeed in doing one thing,  even if nothing else--which is that they remind you how good the music was  during it's day.  There was some critical lambasting of the soundtrack, and  it's use of non-British musicians/singers as a surrogate Beatles, but  that's merely sour grapes, because none of the current British pop stars  could have made this material work.  NOW, onto the film.
It's true, Ian  Hart (who's recently been called to reprise this role) as John Lennon  steals the show; even if he doesn't physically resemble Lennon, his cynical  rock-star-to-be persona is well represented here.  Ditto the actor who  plays Paul McCartney, but this is, after all, the John and Stu show.  Cheryll Lee is mediocre as Astrid (how would WE know, anyway?), and Stephen  Dorff pulls off the Liverpudlian accent quite admirably for an American  actor.
Like Alan Parker's ""The Committments"", the music is the  centrepiece of the film, but unlike that film, the story has more than  enough substance to occupy our attention the whole way through.  I  especially liked the art-school/Ingrid subtext, making the viewer wonder if  Lennon was looking for an 'Astrid' when he settled for Yoko.",968803200,6,1226,5.095959595959596
606067,4,6303213782,"If you rated this movie based on dramatic content, script, acting, etc. it might not be too strong. As a historical piece, though, it is very strong. Reasonably authentic music that ROCKS (under the direction of famous  producer Don Was), along with a provocative story line, keeps this movie on  the edge. Anyone with an interest in the early sixties or the Beatles  should enjoy Backbeat.",954115200,4,390,4.878787878787879

And many incorrect scenes are in this film. Also found the music horrible by having Grunge bands play the Music.....WHY? They focused on Stu and John's relationship....Which why would I care about anyways? If you ever come across the 1979 TV movie ""Birth of the Beatles"" check it out.
