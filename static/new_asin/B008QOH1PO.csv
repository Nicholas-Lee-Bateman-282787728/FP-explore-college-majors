8529642,5,B008QOH1PO,Vinny is the king!  Me and my boys watched the YouTube video a year ago and have been laughing about it ever since.  It was finally time to get the movie and it more than met our expectations.,1383350400,,192,4.026315789473684
8529643,5,B008QOH1PO,"Hilarious movie, honestly one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I've seen all of The Chins videos on youtube and finally had to order it. It is worth it for the fact that there is 90+ min of extras which are all hilarious too. Awesome movie. A must see. Can't say enough good things about it, probably the MOST underrated movie of 2013.",1364601600,,341,4.34375
8529644,5,B008QOH1PO,No words can describe how much I loved this movie. After I saw his youtube video I always wondered if it was really him or if he was doing an act. This video proves The Chin is the real deal. I watched his youtube video about 2 years ago and as soon as I heard his movie came out I had to pre-order it. Money well spent. Long Live The Chin,1353110400,,339,3.788732394366197

8529646,5,B008QOH1PO,"Hilarious must see movie.  While not politically correct and quite crude, it had me laughing the whole time.  Vinny is crazy!  After finishing the movie, I immediately went to You Tube to see all of his videos - all funny.  DVD extra scenes are great too!",1351382400,,255,4.478260869565218
