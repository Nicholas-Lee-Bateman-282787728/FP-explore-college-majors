1122840,4,7880879625,"I liked ""Kung Fu Panda,"" first for its look, second for its story, and I know that's usually not a good sign. I know that a film that puts style ahead of substance is by default less meaningful, and therefore not worth recommending. But that's being too harsh in this case; ""Kung Fu Panda"" is no more and no less than a family film with light-hearted subject matter, about as enjoyable as the average computer-animated film released this time of year. There's no question that the target audience is younger viewers, and indeed, there's plenty here visually for them to take in; not only is the art direction bold and vibrant, the physical comedy is plentiful, as well. As if martial arts never lent itself to comedy--this year alone saw the release of ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" a family-friendly Kung Fu fable that allowed us to laugh along with the story. ""Kung Fu Panda"" works in pretty much the same way, probably even better because it's an animated film.

Taking place in ancient China, we're immediately introduced to Po (voiced by Jack Black), a very overweight panda who runs a noodle stand with his bird father (voiced by James Hong). Unbeknownst to him, Po dreams of one day becoming a Kung Fu master, to be respected and adored by every animal living in the Valley of Peace. He wants to be as legendary as the Furious Five, Kung Fu disciples whose various animal styles reflect what they actually are (Viper practices viper-style, Crane practices crane-style, etc.). Po's humdrum life is changed when the elderly Kung Fu master--a turtle named Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim)--chooses him as the next Dragon Warrior; it was during a temple ceremony that drew out the entire village, and Po barely managed to get there at all. The temple, you see, is located at the top of a very tall mountain, and the only way to get there is by climbing thousands of steps. Can you imagine how much energy a fat panda would need to do that?

Po's choosing comes as a shock to the Furious Five: Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie), Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan), Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogen), Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu), and Crane (voiced by David Cross). Each is incredibly skilled in the ways of Kung Fu, yet an untrained, overweight panda has been chosen. No one is more upset about the situation than Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), who had been training the Furious Five for many years. He frantically appeals to Master Oogway, who can only speak in philosophical metaphors; the wise old turtle believes that absolutely nothing happens by accident, and you can never force the natural order of things, no matter how hard you try. Po will meet his destiny and become the next great Dragon Warrior only when Shifu decides to train him. That, of course, can only happen if he believes in him.

The thing is, Po initially doesn't believe in himself; despite his dream of being a Kung Fu master, he knows all too well that he's not ready for this, especially now that the other warriors hate him. The attempts at conventional training are disastrous until Shifu discovers Po's amazing ability to eat. Basically, his Kung Fu skills only emerge when he's after food. Po and Shifu eventually battle over a bowl of dumplings, and I don't think I've ever seen such lightening-fast chopstick maneuvers, in either an animated or a live action film. It gets the most intense when only one is left. Po unconsciously pushes himself to the limit when food is at stake, which isn't so far fetched since pandas are known to gorge themselves, especially in the spring months. Not that anyone will care about that--""Kung Fu Panda"" is about comedy and special effects, not behavioral facts.

In the midst of all this training looms a dangerous threat: a ruthless leopard named Tai Lung (voiced by Ian McShane) has escaped from a maximum-security prison guarded by rhinos. He started out as Shifu's star pupil, but turned evil when Master Oogway refused to declare him the next Dragon Warrior. Now on the loose, Po discovers that only he can stop Tai Lung, meaning he must complete his training in a very short period of time. His final task is to open the Dragon Scroll, something that will supposedly tell him the secret to being the ultimate Kung Fu master.

If this sounds entertaining enough, that's because it is. It does not, however, transcend any recent computer-animated film, least of all in terms of story or characterization. A couple of things baffle the mind, like how it's possible for a tiny mantis or a snake or a crane to be a lethal Kung Fu warrior. And doesn't it make you wonder why Po's father is a bird? Near the end of the film, Po turns to him and says, ""Sometimes I think I'm not even your son,"" so at least the filmmakers were well aware of what they were doing. Still, it seems a little too out of place, a little too unmindful of simple logistics like a panda being the offspring of other pandas. I did like the way the film looked, especially during some wide shots showing vast distances between fog-shrouded mountains. The film was projected on a seventy-millimeter screen, which was nice because the breathtaking landscapes weren't overcrowded, even when characters were present. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is definitely pretty looking, and while it doesn't tell a substantive story, there's enough there to keep you entertained all throughout.",1213056000,2,5351,4.74328678839957
1122841,5,7880879625,"Ok, I admit, I went to the theatre a bit negatively pre-biased.  Sure, the previews I saw were mildy funny and I do like Jack Black, but I thought Kung Fu Panda would be yet another vapid kids' animated movie with anthropomorphized animals saying cleverly planned puns and adultish in-jokes and that the funniest scenes were probably already shown in the trailer to draw audiences in.

I was very pleasantly surprised to be wrong.  Kung Fu Panda is hilarious and well-made, and though it is clearly aimed at kids, it was tremendously entertaining and satisfying for adults too.  The movie was pretty evenly funny throughout, with occasional uproarious hilarity, esp from Jack Black.  Like, have you ever gotten a comic image stuck in your head and you (embarrassingly) find yourself chuckling outloud, by yourself, for minutes after the audience stopped laughing?  Well, there were several moments like that in this movie for me.  There was a subtle, clever layer of humour particularly in some of the facial expressions, and I even found some of the side storylines genuinely touching, like the relationship between the son, a chubby panda (voiced by Jack Black) and the kind-hearted, noodle-shop owner father, a stork (voiced by James Hong).  The villain, a cloud leopard with sinister glowing eyes, is really menacing and scary (believe it or not), enough to scare some small kids into tears, so be forewarned.  The whole production, the ""legendary"" tale, authentic movements, and background sets really HONOR the Kung Fu movie tradition more than parody it, I thought.  I mean to say, the Kung Fu itself was pretty good (though it's animated and practiced by animals).  The animation was superb, and in particular, some of the food they showed was just mouth-watering (it really made us crave Chinese dumplings and noodles).  Lastly, I'd like to add that I went to the movie theatre without knowing who the voice cast was.  I only knew that Jack Black was in it.  Watching as the end credits rolled, we were just as entertained (again) in discovering the great (and distinguished) voice talent behind the animation.  I was actually able to correctly guess one person (the Rhino captain of the Prison guards), though everyone's voice will be vaguely familiar.
I highly recommend Kung Fu Panda for the whole family.",1213056000,5,2317,4.997395833333333

Well....actually......

We COULD ask for a sequel!

1122843,5,7880879625,"First, let me say, that a little Jack Black, for me, goes a long way.  When I heard that he was voicing Po, the main character of this movie, I wasn't sure if I could stomach the film, although the previews looked very good.  I'm glad to say that Black's performance is charming and sweet and this new animated offering from Dreamworks is a pleasant and welcomed addition to the summer box office.

  The story revolves around Po the Panda, who works for his father in a noodle shop but dreams of the exploits of his martial arts idols, the Furious Five.  These five consist of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Viper (Lucy Liu).  Atop a mountain overlooking the village is the Jade Pallace, where these warriors train, led by their master, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his master, a wise old turtle, Oogway.  By accident (or not by accident as the ancient turtle reminds them) Po is named the Dragon Warrior, much to the dismay of Shifu and his students.  However, once Tai Lung, a former student-turned villain, escapes from prison,  Shifu realizes he must learn to believe in the chubby, food-loving panda and train him for the fight ahead.  He knows that Tai Lung will stop at nothing to acquire the sacred Dragon scroll, believed to reveal great powers to the Dragon Warrior.

  Dreamworks delivers with this animated tale, full of rich, beautiful color and sharp, eye-popping animation.  The characters are entertainig and Po is endearing and loveable, a hero everyone will want to root for.  Thankfully, this is a film that both the kiddies and the adults can enjoy.  As with their Shrek franchise, Dreamworks' Panda offers humor that appeals to all.  I look forward to this little gem's dvd release.  Highly recommended!",1212883200,2,1785,4.8316831683168315
1122844,5,7880879625,"Along with Shrek, Kung Fu Panda is Dreamworks best animated film to date by far. The voice talent is excellent, especially Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. These two not only have the best characters in the movie, but they have the perfect voices to make them stand out from all the rest. Ian McShane is also really great as the villian, but Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan are wasted. Seth Rogen has some good lines as Mantis, but Chan as Monkey gets only two lines of dialogue. What's the point of having someone as well known as him if he doesn't say more than a few words?

The animation itself is in the same league as Pixar (especially in the digital theater I saw it in). The colors and textures will make you feel your really in ancient China. The character models and details are as good as any that have come before if not better. You know they did a good job when you actually care about an animated creature.

Kung Fu Panda is funny throughout without sacrificing the story, which is better than you may think. It seemed like the kids and adults were laughing on the same wavelength most of the time, which just shows you how well thought out the writing is. It works for everyone.

1122845,5,7880879625,"This is the usual ""loser makes good"" plot as Po the pudgy Panda evolves from a lowly waiter in his father's noodle shop to the forecasted Dragon Warrior.  It is non-stop fun with enough quips and one liners to keep the attention of mom and dad.  I was there with my grand children and they loved it -- even the 17 year old thought it was worth seeing over ""without all of the little kids"".  I was especially impressed by the stunning art work and many scenes look like oriental paintings -- it is beautifully done.  I also was impressed by the fact that the movie just starts with little to no introduction.  This is clearly intended to immediately capture the interest of the small children  and I thought it did.  The credits are held until the end of the movie.

This is a very good movie and a lot of fun.  If you are looking for a film to take your kids to this is an excellent choice.  Mom and dad will like this movie just as much as the kids.",1212883200,3,950,4.170329670329671
1122846,3,7880879625,"By day, Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black) struggles as a waiter in his father's noodle shop.  But he dreams of being a kung fu warrior.

When he learns the Dragon Warrior is finally going to be named, he rushes to the temple and by accident ends up at the end of the Ooway the Ancient Turtle's (voice by Randall Duk Kim) pointing finger when he makes the proclamation. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his five fighting pupils are all dismayed at the choice, but Ooway advises them there are no accidents.

Finally, when the snow leopard Tai Ling (Ian McShane) breaks out of jail and comes to wreak his vengeance on teh valley, Shifu agrees to help Po learn to fight.  All he needs is to believe in himself and work hard...

Dreamworks has done a great job with the CGI for this film. The animation is smooth and the characters really do seem real.  The Chinese countryside is beautiful as well.

Clearly, from the video games and plush toys you can find on Amazon, this movie may well be a contender for largest sales of related products.  The movie itself is entertaining for kids of all ages.

Rebecca Kyle, June 2008",1212710400,5,1123,4.465686274509804
1122847,5,7880879625,I went to this movie for my 9 year old girl and didn't expect to do anything but sleep through it. I was very surprised that I really liked it and laughed with it. The plot is nothing we all haven't seen before but the  way it was done and the wonderful graphics made this a real gem. Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed.,1212710400,2,332,3.955223880597015
1122848,3,7880879625,"DreamWorks Animation once again produces a computer animated film that contains topnotch animation, plenty of comedy, and recognizable celebrity voices. Kung Fu Panda also has a generous helping of heart, and Jack Black's voice performance manages to be exceedingly entertaining instead of generally annoying, as some of his live action routines tend to become. With martial arts action, adventure, and jokes for both children and adults, Kung Fu Panda is worthwhile family entertainment.

""There is no charge for awesomeness,"" states the all-powerful Panda warrior Po, as he dreams about fighting droves of enemies and defending his home, the Valley of Peace, with unmatchable martial arts skills and esprit de corps with his battling companions, the Furious Five. But when he awakes, Po (Jack Black) is nothing more than a clumsy and overweight panda noodle vendor who is destined to serve the valley the finest meals with his father (who is a goose). Po yearns to learn kung fu and help save his people by doing battle against all who threaten their way of life, but as his father continually reminds him, it is not his destiny.

Fortunate circumstances change everything one day when Po journeys into the city to watch the sage Master Oogway finally choose the legendary Dragon Warrior, prophesied to defeat the vile Tai Lung, a rogue warrior who has been locked away for years. The candidates are the legendary Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen, who seems to be in every animated film this year), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross). When Po accidentally crashes into the arena via fireworks strapped to a wooden chair, Oogway pronounces the unconscious panda as the mighty Dragon Warrior. Shocked and thrilled, Po joins the five skeptical warriors in the Jade Palace as they train to battle Tai Lung, who recently escaped from an inescapable prison stronghold. But the greatest kung fu teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is outraged at Oogway's decision to leave the city in the hands of the unskilled panda. It will take everything in Po's power to live up to the designation bestowed upon him, and to prove that even a chubby lummox can master the martial arts.

Kung Fu Panda is another technically superior achievement for DreamWorks Animation, utilizing some of the best computer graphics and animators available. The movements, textures, fur/hair, backgrounds, and lighting are impressively realistic, even though the character designs themselves are largely cartoonish. But those designs are also outstanding, demonstrating a great sense of humor with Shifu's tiny mouse, Oogway's quivering turtle, Po's roly-poly panda, and even background characters such as a pig with five o'clock shadow. Going hand-in-hand with the hilarious character designs is the editing, which oftentimes mocks anime and martial arts films, and starts off in stylized 2-D animation during Po's dream sequence.

Gathering together a large ensemble cast of recognizable voices, for once the numerous celebrities don't detract from the film. Jack Black is nearly perfect as Po, who one might imagine as Black in a panda suit. Unlike this year's Horton Hears a Who remake in which Jim Carrey and Steve Carell's voices overshadowed their characters to the point of unrecognizable, Po is believable just as he is. Hoffman and the many supporting characters also deliver appropriately subtle performances that don't take the viewers attention away from the animated exploits onscreen.

Although the re-watching value might be slim for adults, and the underdog tale is understandably generic, Kung Fu Panda packs a punch with its traditional martial arts mix of fast-paced action, way-too-powerful villains, destinies, legends, prophecies, and killer kung fu moves. And to top it all off is constant comedy (albeit immature, ""a kick to the tenders"" comedy) that is sure to provoke chuckles from everyone.

1123519,5,7880879625,"This is one of my favorite animated movies.  It does a great job of drawing on all of those old school chop socky flicks where the student exceeds the teacher, only Po is no ordinary student.  His girth and appetite are a constant source of amusement and irritation but his redoubtable attitude and his zest for life are his real strengths.  All of the main characters are well drawn and enjoyable and Ian McShane voicing the villain is simply deliciousness as he sinks his pearly whites into the part.  The entire voice cast does a great job but Jack Black inhabits Po as few other voice actors have managed to inhabit their characters, and Dustin Hoffmans put-upon sensei is pitch perfect.  This is a universe Id like to live in for a day.  The Ultimate Edition of Awesomeness has a lot of fun features to it but nothing compares to the movie itself.",1513987200,,852,4.5359477124183005

1124763,5,7880879625,"When I walked into the screening for Kung Fu Panda, my expectations were low. The movie's trailer looked only so-so and I was anticipating that the theater full of kids and I would be bombarded with heavy-handed Eastern mysticism, pummeled by imitable fist-to-face bash and smash, andbased on comedian Jack Black's past film choiceshanded a noodle bowl full of poo-poo humor.
I was pleasantly surprised. I found a colorful garden where I half expected a bog. Lush watercolor visuals and fun characters instead of flat animation and bland storytelling. A few kids will certainly come out of the theater itching to try out some of the roundhouse kicking, panda-belly-bouncing bedlam they've seen onscreen, but if the little roughhousing rascals a colleague of mine saw after the film are any indication, the moves they'll try are going to be of the friendly variety, not headlocks and punches. Previously stated spirituality is definitely present, but it's as spare as a martial arts cartoon set in ancient China will reasonably allow. And the humor runs clear and fresh.
In the film's production notes, co-director Mark Osborne had this to say: ""It was important to all of us, from the start, that Kung Fu Panda would have a theme, a positive message that we really believed in. We wanted it to be a fun experience loaded with comedy and great action. But we also wanted there to be a takeaway that we all believed was a good one.""
To that end, the story projects a well-worn ""Follow your heart and believe in yourself"" theme. But it also encourages finding your own strengths, being disciplined, learning from those who are older and wiser, protecting the innocent and standing up for what's right even when you're afraid you might fail.
Oh, yeah. There's one more thing this film encourages: hordes of cuddly stuffed animals forever frozen in kung fu pose.",1488326400,,1857,4.917197452229299

The panda, who was unhappy in his life, was pushed into pursuing his life long dream, amongst the ridicule of those who didn't believe he could do it.  He refused to give up, and with a little help, was able to conquer his enemy and save the village.

Yet the scenes went by at a pace that was easy to follow and caused more ""wow"" then ""what just happened"" that i tend to get from a lot of action movies. Send a good if oft repeated message. The animation was top notch. The art direction of the scenery was well chosen and pleasing to the eye. The script was well thought out and original.

I don't like the actor that voiced the main character. Most the parts he has acted out in other movies just ground a nerve. He is just to good at acting out the parts he is cast in. He did really well in this movie though. The other voice actors did rather well too.",1478908800,,711,4.227941176470588

1130953,4,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda is a really cute animated kids movie.  The gist - a lazy, out of shape panda who is raised by a duck family is mistaken for a ninja warrior.  He is thought to be 'the chosen one' who is destined to fight the bad guy who's been imprisioned for many years.  He's trained by his sensei and a group of other animal kung fu masters.

For kids, it's a really cute story with a fat panda who bumbles through things and blindly seems to come out on top.  There's a lot of 'fighting' (kung fu style) that keeps it fast paced and interesting.  There's the typical good guy vs bad guy plot.  There are plenty of jokes and it's overall a really entertaining film.

For parents, there are some jokes that are a bit above the kids' heads that will make you chuckle.  If you're into messages in your cartoons, there's a 'don't judge a book by its cover' and a 'you can do anything you can set your mind to' message.  There's also a message about trust, bravery and loyalty.

It's a cute movie worth watching.  I haven't seen the sequels, but I plan to check them out soon!",1470700800,,1071,4.221674876847291

1131239,5,7880879625,"My kids and my wife and I LOVE this movie. As a voice actor, I'm always impressed with Jack Black in these KFP movies--he's so over-the-top in most of his other stuff, but he fits right into Po... almost like he's channeling himself for this role. Dustin Hoffman is HILARIOUSLY aloof when he's not enraged. The Furious Five were... well, they're really less than ""furious"" in a demonstrative sense (though Tigress does fairly seethe in every scene she's in... but it's still not Angelina Jolie's best work, I don't think). Really, they're not developed very much, but then again, the movie's not about them.

I would say, ""If you don't like this, there's something wrong with you,"" but I'm not really qualified to make that kind of statement. But it's still probably true.",1470268800,,772,4.804511278195489

1132423,4,7880879625,"4 Stars. Dreamworks takes a page from Pixars book and creates an animation that was more complex than anything they did before. It also had a charming and captivating storyline and received a Best Animation nomination. It ultimately lost out to Pixars WALL-E (2008) but is definitely a close 2nd. Po (Jack Black), the only panda left, is fat and lazy. He has been raised by Mr. Ping, who runs a noodle shop and wants Po to someday take over. Po is also the biggest Kung Fu fan and idealizes the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Monkey (Jackie Chan). When Po tries to attend tournament where Kung Fu Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) will chose the Dragon Warrior, he is locked out. Po using a chair full of fireworks flies into the tournament and is named the Dragon Warrior, much to the Furious Five and their master, Shifus (Dustin Hoffman), disagreement. Shifus vengeful and dangerous pupil, snow leopard Tai Lung, soon escapes his prison and heads their way to get the Dragon Scroll. Its up the Furious Five and Shifu to overcome their differences with Po, and train him to defeat Tai Lung. Its up to Po to learn and turn his weight into an ability to become the Dragon Warrior.  Original meant to be a parody, the team behind Kung Fu Panda decided to make it an action comedy wuxia (martial hero) film that incorporates the heros journey narrative. With influences from a number of classic kung fu movies like Stephen Chows action comedy, Kung Fu Hustle (2004), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Hero (2002), and House of Flying Daggers (2004). They also play homage to the Shaw Brothers with the characters, KG Shaw and JR Shaw. Tiger, Crane, Mantis, Viper, and Monkey are also all kung fu styles. Production designer Raymond Zibach and art director Tang Heng spent years researching Chinese painting, sculpture, architecture and kung fu films to help create the look of the film. Hans Zimmer even visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the China National Symphony Orchestra before co-creating the score with John Powell. With a stellar cast and all the preparation this charming movie is fun and has a lot of heart, which you expect from a great animation. Its a must see for kids and fans of the kung fu drama, as it stands up to some of the greats.",1468454400,,2344,4.70316301703163

1132512,5,7880879625,"Po loves to play with action figures of the legendary Furious FiveTigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey. He dreams of being in their ranks as a true deliverer of kung fu awesomeness. But, alas, he is only a chubby, stumble-footed and easily winded panda, not a lightning-fast, disciplined martial artist. So he's stuck in the family noodle business.

When word goes out that a Dragon Warrior will be chosen to fulfill legend and defend the Jade Kingdom from the dreaded martial arts master Tai Lung, Po can't contain his excitement. With a great deal of effort he lugs his considerable heft up the hundreds of steps to the Jade Palace to see who will land the great honor.

Turns out, he lands itafter accidentally crashing the tryout party.

Nobody can believe it. Especially not the Furious Five and their kung fu master Shifu. But since the enemy is already on his way, they have to do something. If Tai Lung gets his hands on the lauded Dragon Scroll, he will surely be powerful enough to rule the world. Po must do whatever it takes to face the fearsome and treacherous foe. Uh ... right after lunch, that is.

Positive Elements

Po wants to honor his father even though he is drawn to martial arts and not to the family business. When dad realizes where Po's gifts lie, he embraces his son and gives him his blessing. They both express their love for one another.

Doing your best and believing in yourself is a theme that runs throughout the movie. Master Shifu doesn't believe that Po is the right choice to defend the kingdom and initially he tries to get him to quit. But when the older and wiser Oogway asks him to train and believe in Po, Shifu submits to his mentor's request and gives the task his all. Later, Shifu risks his life to give the townspeople time to escape Tai Lung's wrath. And the Furious Five, though great warriors themselves, honor Shifu's request that they take care of the innocent rather than fight.

Master Shifu raised Tai Lung from a small cub and loved him like a son. Before the two battle, the elder master speaks of his pride for Tai Lung. But he goes on to apologize for how that same pride negatively impacted the angry fighter.
Spiritual Content

This being a martial arts story set in China, characters are influenced by the Eastern spirituality around them.

Oogway, the philosophizing turtle master (""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a giftthat is why they call it the present""), has a dream that the imprisoned Tai Lung will escape his bonds and return to the kingdom (which comes true). He also believes that there are no accidents and that ""the universe"" has delivered Po to be their Dragon Warrior. When sensing that his end is near, Oogway dissolves into a swirl of fruit tree petals that float into the sky.

After being chosen as the Dragon Warrior, Po is ushered into the Sacred Hall of Warriors. There he finds an urn that is supposedly filled with the souls of a defeated army. And when he accidentally breaks the urn, a glowing puff of smoke is freed.

Po and Master Shifu visit a small mountain lake called the Pool of Sacred Tears that the master says is the birth place of kung fu. When seen from above, the pool looks like the ancient ying and yang symbol. In a dream, Po sets off to fight ""10,000 demons of Demon Mountain.""

[Spoiler Warning] A great deal of spiritual mystery revolves around the Dragon Scroll. Many believe that when a great warrior reads the scroll he will be imbued with magical superpowers. In truth, when the scroll is finally unrolled, it has nothing to do with magic at all.
Sexual Content

When Po clamps two noodle bowls to his chest, it gives the impression that he's wearing a bikini top.
Violent Content

Oogway is the only character who ""dies."" But the kung fu fighting is constant and furiousthough often presented in a humorous manner.

Beginning the starstruck Po's training, Shifu tells him, ""The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones."" He proceeds to oversee Po's preliminary pummeling at the hands of the Furious Five as well as mechanical creations designed to poke, prod, whack, thwack, toss, tilt, twirl and burn would-be kung fu fighters.

There are a few battles with Tai Lung that, while not really scary, could seem fairly intense to very young viewers. He's a pretty powerful-looking, always snarling presence, much like Shere Khan from The Jungle Bookonly with roundhouse kicks. In one case, Tai Lung escapes from prison and battles numerous rhino captors with spectacular kicks, leaps and throws. The rhinos are hit (in slow motion) with their own spears and clubs. And the Furious Five battle the villain on a whiplashing rope bridge suspended above a bottomless chasm. (It looks like someone could fall to their death at any moment.) The bad guy paralyzes several of the Five with a nerve pinch. Tai Lung fights with Master Shifu and the two hit and kick each other with acrobatic swirls. Tai Lung throws blade weapons at his former master and Shifu knocks them aside. Shifu hits a stone pillar and is knocked unconscious.

[Spoiler Warning] The film culminates with a huge fight between Po and Tai Lung (which is played for laughs all the way through). Fur flies. A building collapses. Craters are blasted into the earth as bodies crash down upon it. A nuclear-level shockwave expands outward when the final blow lands. When it's over, Po runs to Shifu's side and it appears that the kung fu master has died. But he soon points out that he's really just getting some much-needed rest.
Crude or Profane Language

Shifu calls Po an ""idiot."" One of the Furious Five says that the panda has a ""fat butt, flabby arms and a ridiculous belly."" Later, when commenting on his performance, Po says, ""I sucked more than ... anyone in the history of sucking.""
Drug and Alcohol Content

None.
Other Negative Elements

A passing reference is made to gambling. Po straps himself and a bunch of fireworks rockets to a chair. When he lights them, he's blasted high into the sky.

When Po first shows up, the Furious Five are not happy about his presence. One says, ""You're a disgrace to Jade Palace and everything we stand for.""

Po is hit in the crotch while training and exclaims, ""My tenders!"" While being hit by Tai Lung, the panda's belly is jiggling so hard that he laughs, ""I'm gonna pee.""
Conclusion

When I walked into the screening for Kung Fu Panda, my expectations were low. The movie's trailer looked only so-so and I was anticipating that the theater full of kids and I would be bombarded with heavy-handed Eastern mysticism, pummeled by imitable fist-to-face bash and smash, andbased on comedian Jack Black's past film choiceshanded a noodle bowl full of poo-poo humor.

I was pleasantly surprised. I found a colorful garden where I half expected a bog. Lush watercolor visuals and fun characters instead of flat animation and bland storytelling. A few kids will certainly come out of the theater itching to try out some of the roundhouse kicking, panda-belly-bouncing bedlam they've seen onscreen, but if the little roughhousing rascals a colleague of mine saw after the film are any indication, the moves they'll try are going to be of the friendly variety, not headlocks and punches. Previously stated spirituality is definitely present, but it's as spare as a martial arts cartoon set in ancient China will reasonably allow. And the humor runs clear and fresh.

In the film's production notes, co-director Mark Osborne had this to say: ""It was important to all of us, from the start, that Kung Fu Panda would have a theme, a positive message that we really believed in. We wanted it to be a fun experience loaded with comedy and great action. But we also wanted there to be a takeaway that we all believed was a good one.""

To that end, the story projects a well-worn ""Follow your heart and believe in yourself"" theme. But it also encourages finding your own strengths, being disciplined, learning from those who are older and wiser, protecting the innocent and standing up for what's right even when you're afraid you might fail.

Oh, yeah. There's one more thing this film encourages: hordes of cuddly stuffed animals forever frozen in kung fu poses.",1468195200,,8238,4.739343116701607

I thought this would just be so-so as I'm generally not a huge fan of Jack Black and the idea of a Panda that knows Kung Fu seemed extremely absurd, but I gave it a shot anyway. Shifu's character, the Master of Po, is hilarious. I'd watch this just to see him. I've also heard the sequels are really funny, contrary to typical animated sequels that usually suck. Overall, I love this. Granted, I got it for free, but still... it's a great movie for adults and kids!",1467158400,,590,4.472222222222222

Jack Black wonderfully shows us how Pandas, while appearing rather endearing, actually possess a high aptitude for violence. The historical accuracy of this film is only rivaled by critically acclaimed feature films such as Mulan, Pocahontas, and The Little Mermaid. From a moral standpoint this movie was very black and white, which is refreshing in a world where gray areas seem to be ever widening. Great film. 5 stars.",1466899200,,529,5.151162790697675

Perhaps it is special to me because it's the first movie I ever took my son (then 3) to see in the theater. But as the sequels have come out we've watched the original again and again alongside the new ones. Great stuff. I liked the animation, but the content is really where it's at for me. What a journey of self-discovery for (initially very goofy) Po, and as well for the 5. And master Shifu learned plenty lessons along the way too. We could all use a friend like Oogway. Absolutely chock full of the kinds of ideas I want my son to learn/internalize. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet by spilling Oogway's wonderful insights and sayings. It's hard for me to name a better movie for young kids and parents to watch together on a rainy day.",1462233600,,878,4.232142857142857

We made our own snacks and threw down a blanket on the floor and had a inside movie day.  The kids loved it. It was easy to keep their attention also as they stayed on the blanket( which was their seats for the movie) and of course we had our snacks as we watched the movie. The kids loved the movie, and wanted to watch it again. I promised the next time they come they can watch it again. They sat through the whole movie watching and laughing and I must admit I, as the adult loved it also. It had some really good lessons for the kids.

It teaches a lot of good lessons, has some good cartoon action, and a lot of comedy. Sure, there are a lot of cheesy parts, but I think that need more of that type of humor in our lives. I wouldn't watch it every single day, but I liked it enough that I bought it off of Amazon!

All Po wants to do is Kun Fu. While he spends his night dreaming, he spends his day trying to please his father in the noodle business. That all changes when he is crowned the Dragon Warrior.

With just the right characters mixed in with drama and action, this movie is amazing.

It also portrayed kung-fu as merely a fighting art, when in fact true kung-fu was about an entire lifestyle that included poetry, music, math, and all of the arts and science. That is why so many of the animal styles developed, because of the kung-fu man observing nature  (science) around him. So kids just come away from this film thinking that life is about fist fighting!

1139081,5,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda is good family fun!  As a kid growing up with Chris Farley and Beverly Hills Ninja, this is a much more kid friendly and enjoyable version.  DreamWorks Pictures has been doing a great job recently keeping up with Pixar and the other animated production studios.  In the vein of Shrek, they have an all-star cast of voice actors playing roles that you can envision them having a blast while making the film. There is a lot of fighting and cartoon violence, so I can understand if some parents are cautious to show their younger children. There is even some death and discussion of an afterlife in the film, but it is all in the context of Ancient China, so hopefully protective parents can justify and explain any differences reasonably. There are some silly things, like a panda being the child of a duck, that go unexplained in this film (but are addressed in the next :-D) that help keep the movie light and fun. Another thing to be aware of is the attention to the fact that the main character is overweight and the biases that he has to endure as such. There is a bit of glorification of the panda's overeating, but an educated parent should be able to point out that, in this case, the fact that he is a panda makes this eating habit a species-specific necessity, rather than an endorsement for kids to over-indulge. Overall, it's a great movie that has something for the whole family. ",1461196800,,1405,4.541501976284585

But I have to admit that I actually like the tv series version of Po's adventures as the Dragon Warrior even more than the movie franchise versionnot the same vocal talents (excepting my personal favorite, the irreplaceable James Hong), yet it has a much more ""adult"" sense of humor for some reasonbut the movies do feature Dustin Hoffman providing the voice talent for a tiny red panda named, ""Master Shifu"".

But Kung Fu Panda exists on a deeper level for an audience beyond the age of nine about daring to become something greater than what your parents or society expects of you. The journey will be difficult without a doubt, but if you stick with it, you are going to be okay.

A deeply impactful and emotional movie for me who is in his twenties and is really beginning to wonder where his life is going. I think the best animated movies are those that contain a little something for everyone whether they are 4 or 80 because no one wants to go to or rent a movie for ninety minutes and be bored.

1139885,5,7880879625,"Now I get it why Kung Fu Panda raked in box office loot and warranted two sequels. This movie is like a box of frisky kittens or Betty White dabbing. It's damn adorable. I'm normally not a Jack Black guy since I most of the time find him obnoxious and excruciatingly mannered. But now I know I can stand him, provided he's doing only voice work and I don't have to eyeball him in the real. Black engagingly inhabits Po, a bumbling panda who toils ineptly in his father's noodle shop in some alternate ancient China. Let me mention that Po's adoptive father is a goose. A goose! The goose, Mr. Ping (James Hong), hopes that Po will someday take over the family business. Only, Po aspires to a loftier goal. He idolizes the Furious Five, that celebrated quintet of martial arts prodigiousness, each of which member embodies a particular discipline. He has action figures of them - how very anachronistic of him.

And, then, a momentous day, a game-changing day! Time has come to choose, from the masses, the mighty Dragon Warrior - him what's destined to open the dragon scroll and so obtain the secrets of the universe and fulfill an ancient prophecy. Well! Po, giddy fan boy, cannot miss out on such a pivotal martial arts spectacle. He attends on the pretense told his goose dad that he's gonna sell noodly goods.

There has to be dramatic conflict, and it comes two-fold. More immediate is the tense interplay between Po and his reluctant martial arts instructor, his sifu, him what can't believe fate had chosen  as the Dragon Warrior a fat, bungling, graceless, dumpling-scarfing panda. Lurking initially in the backdrop is the sub-plot of the malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), held in torturous confinement these past twenty years, but not for much longer. Some background on the big bad: Tai Lung, martial artist supreme, harbors a seething mad-on for his teacher. See, Tai Lung had considered himself the ideal candidate to be the Dragon Warrior. His teacher begged to differ. D'you ken how Tai Lung and Po's paths converge?

Kung Fu Panda showed out in 2008 and, eight years later, its life lessons still apply. A type of gentle humor abounds; it'll tickle the young uns' fancy and amuse the wrinklier persons. Po is the centerpiece, and he' so cute and affable, and an ungainly panda learning kung fu is simply a delightful conceit. Someone smartly reined in Black's excesses, and so what we get is voiceover work that integrates well with the visuals. Po consistently exhibits this disarming sense of wonder and of discovery, and this goes a long way into making him so rootable. But he's not the only attraction. It's a cavalcade of celebrity voices, with Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Dustin Hoffman (Sifu), Lucy Liu (Viper), David Cross (Crane), and Seth Rogen (Mantis) adroitly filling up the spaces around Black.

Don't sleep on the action beats for they are dope, flawlessly rendered by wicked good CG animation. The martial arts sequences are handled with dynamic choreography and strewn with deft comic flourishes. At one point I was rendered giddy by a dizzyingly staged training skirmish between Po and his sifu waged with chopsticks and keying in on one lone surviving dumpling. I wager to brag that that scene qualifies as one of the most inspired sequences in martial arts cinema, let alone in cartoondom. And the life lessons I touched on earlier? I love it when movies don't serve up their messages in heavy-handed fashion. Kids will organically pick up on what this movie imparts: the importance of self-worth, that ain't no secret to greatness besides faith in oneself. Who needs a dumb dragon scroll?",1460505600,3,3660,4.8496

1141219,4,7880879625,"I was really surprised by how good a movie this is. It's not just good-for-animation or good-for-a-kids'-movie, but solidly good-for-anyone-to-watch-anytime.
It follows most of the standard tropes of a martial arts movie, including the obligatory training montage, but one thing that struck me was the body-positive message subtly hidden there. Po becomes a bad-ass martial artist through training, but he doesn't suddenly become a ripped specimen of manhood in the process. He embraces his big belly and uses it to further his panda style kung fu instead of treating it as a hindrance.",1459209600,,586,5.311827956989247

1141342,4,7880879625,"Quite entertaining, but nothing seminal. I found it a bit awkward that among the Fab 5 were a viper and a mantis. I believe they could have found stronger candidates within the animal kingdom, but I guess they went with ""diversity"". There is almost no character development either, Jackie Chan (monkey) gets almost no lines in the entire movie (this could be his character thing, but except for Tigress, the other Fab 5 didn't get much screen time either). Also Po goes from nothing to Dragon Warrior way too fast. Of course realism isn't a priority in such a movie, so overall, I think it was a good way to spend 1.5 hours.",1459209600,,624,4.530973451327434

""Blazing Saddles"" is both a brilliant parody of Western movies and their tropes, and a great (if deeply silly) Western. ""Spaceballs"" wouldn't be half so brilliant if it didn't work as a space opera.

""Kung Fu Panda"" succeeds with flying colors - as a loving parody of kung fu cinema, it also stands as a great kung-fu film in its own right. Any lover of martial arts stories needs to give this one a watch.",1458000000,,493,4.3478260869565215

Po a panda bear that was raised by a duck and works at his father's noodle shop is told to take the noodle cart to the ceremony where a new trainee will be chosen. Po has dreamed and fantasized his whole life about being part of the Furious 5, an ancient grouping of warriors skilled in the art of KungFu, so the opportunity to see a new student chosen is almost as good as being able to BE the student. Unfortunately, Po is a Fat panda bear and struggles to get to the top of the stairs leading to the temple especially under the weight of his noodle cart.

Still, if you can find it under the $10 barrier (maybe $5?), it wouldn't be a bad purchase. I really don't care too much for the current animation styles preponderant in today's world, but the work on this was decent enough. I liked the writing as well - though heavy on the humor aspects (but - this would probably be intended more for children/family viewing). The voice-work is also decent - fitting the characters nicely.

Bottom line: a very decent family-oriented film (maybe a little bit of cartoonish violence - but nothing I would think could distress anyone). I would think children (all ages) might enjoy it.",1456099200,,751,4.6893939393939394

It was a mix of old kung fu movie nostalgia, The Matrix fight scene choreography, awesome animation, and the humor of Jack Black. A winning combination and I hope they do a sequel because I could have watched this all day.

The movie has a great story that keeps you you in anticipation, is paced very well, and while you know how this movie will end it is still surprising and pays off in a big way.",1455667200,,641,4.378151260504202

1149150,4,7880879625,"Twentieth Century Fox decided to rerelease Kung Fu Panda and Kung Fu Panda 2 to coincide with the January 29 theatrical debut of the much-anticipated Kung Fu Panda 3. And when I say much anticipated Im not talking about anyone who lives in my house.

It took two weeks before I could even convince my two teens to finally watch the original Kung Fu Panda with me so I could review it for Family Home Theater. I have to admit, I don't blame them. The previews made it look like an all-action/no-cleverness Saturday morning formula cartoon. Maybe the studio was playing to the lowest common denominator, but if the trailer had included a couple of the many clever lines and character-driven moments instead of all that wax-on wax-off stuff, we would have watched it LONG ago.

Though critics whove seen the second sequel at early screenings have said #3 is the best of the bunch, the original film turns out to be a tough one to beat. In it, a Panda named Po (voiced by Jack Black) could be the alter ego for any number of slacker kids who aren't yet ready to face up to their potential, though that potential is all but proven by a dream for the future that they have. In Pos case, he wants to be a Kung Fu master, like Master Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Master Viper (Lucy Liu), Master Monkey (Jackie Chan), Master Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Master Crane (David Cross)though he was born into a family business, a noodle shopand I use air quotes because in Kung Fu Panda his dad (James Hong) is a goose. Is Po adopted? Is this cross-species family a writers joke? Could be, because it made us smile. And Po turns out to be the perfect hero for all the kids who have been told they are too short, too tall, too chubby, too uncoordinated, or too dumb to reach goals so lofty youd have to call them dreams.

Pos dad expects him to carry on the family businessa familiar tropebut destiny intervenes. When Po devises a fireworks way of launching himself into the courtyard of the temple so he can witness the coronation of the Dragon Warrior, a chosen one who can defeat the evil Tai Lung (Ian McShane), he launches himself right into the middle of the affair. And a tortoise grand master (Randall Duk kim) anoints him the chosen one. Hey, if he falls out of the sky, he must be right? Because there are no accidents.

Well, except for a visit to check on the security of the prison where the villain is kept immobilized, which goes horribly wrong. With an escape impending and doom just around the corner, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has no time at all to train Po to become the Kung Fu master he always aspired to, and the Dragon Warrior he reluctantly becomes. Star Wars fans will also recognize a familiar pupil-gone-to-the-dark-side storyline.

But the films familiar action-oriented plot doesnt come close to telling the whole story of this film, which is brought to life by sharp dialogue, terrific animation, and voice talents who can take that dialogue and use it to make their characters distinctive and sympatheticand none more so than Po.

This reissue comes with a bonus disc of special features. The main ones are three short Kung Fu Panda Secrets films: Secrets of the Furious Five (2008, 25 min.), Secrets of the Masters (2011, 23 min.), and Secrets of the Scroll (2013, 23 min.). These direct-to-video shorts capitalized on the popularity of the full-length features, and while theyll entertain young ones, the animation isn't up to the standards of the feature filmswhich are really quite impressive in their animation and set, character, and background designs. The other bonus features feel like filler: two mash-ups (blooper collections), a martial arts awesomeness music video, and a Kung Fu Panda 3 sneak peek, for those who haven't gotten to the theater yet.

Dreamworks never fails to pull at your heartstrings and is truly the best animation  company for pre-teens, teenagers, and young adults. Parents too will love this inspiring tale of Po. It does something completely different than either Pixar or Disney. The themes within the Dreamworks movies are thoughtful and well executed. The music by Hanz Zimmer is just another homerun.

1155930,5,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda (2008)
Cast: JACK BLACK; DUSTIN HOFFMAN; ANGELINA JOLIE; LUCY LIU; JACKIE CHAN; DAVID CROSS;  SETH ROGEN; RANDALL DUK KIM AND IAN MCSHANE
DIRECTORS: MARK OSBORNE AND JOHN STEVENSON
GENRE: ANIMATION, ACTION, FAMILY ORIENTED
SYNOPOSIS:  Jack Black, stars as the voice of the lazy but overweight, Po the Panda who works in his father's noodle shop.  He dreams of joining the Furious Five, Tigress (Angelina Jolie); Viper (Lucy Liu); Monkey (Jackie Chan); Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen). The Grand Master, Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) has a vision that the Snow Leopard, Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will escape from prison and head their way.  So Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) sends a messenger to the prison so they can double the guards to make sure Tai Lung doesn't escape but in the end he does escape.  Mean while in the Valley of Peace, Po is chosen as the Dragon Warrior  to the disappointment of Master Shifu and the Furious Five.  Po must believe that he is the Dragon Warrior, if he wants to defeat Tai Lung and save the Valley of Peace.

REVIEW:
Kung Fu Panda had me laughing all through the movie from the beginning to the end.  Jack Black is the perfect voice for Po the Panda.  The movie is hilarious and for me, the actors and actresses are perfectly cast.  Everything is done perfectly.  I love the movie with its characters, kung Fu sequences, beautiful story and background.  In the beginning, Po doubted that he was the Dragon Warrior but he had a talk with Grand Master, Oogway that made him change his mind.  Instead of quitting, he went back and trained in Kung Fu with the help of Master Shifu and soon believed that he was the Dragon Warrior.  Po's weakness for food soon becomes a strength to defeat Tai Lung.  This is a must see movie for children and adults.  It is comedy at its best.
In the end, the Furious Five went from wanting Po to leave to accepting him as the Dragon Warrior.",1454284800,,1925,4.581871345029239

1156271,1,7880879625,"After I watched Kung Fu Panda, I believed that I was the master warrior. I was training myself all of the moves that Po did, and I was slowly becoming the master warrior. One day, when I was 7, a group of gangsters confronted me and stole my money. I decided it was my time to get them back. I came to the hospital where they robbed me before, and I went into my ninja pose. I started speaking Chinese to intimidate them saying, ""CHING CHONG CHING,"" and they all looked confused. It was my confusion tactic. It was working. I aproached the men. Obviously, it was 15 years ago, so they looked older. I snatched the crane one of them was using to walk, and he fell to the floor. I screamed, ""HI-YA!"" and I beat him with the crane. I asked the other 80 year old man, ""remember when you robbed me? "" he then replied, ""I've only ever token money from someone when they gave it to me for my charity. It's for cancer."" I couldn't fall for that. I striked him with the good old classic move. The wippity wopity. He wasn't ready for it. I could tell he still remembered the power of the dark side- wait wrong movie. I could tell he still remember his strength, as I missed my hit. I knew there was only one way to defeat him. Dumplings. I threw 70 dumplings at him, and he looked even more confused. My confusion tactics were still working. I then ran at him, and tried to hit him with the good old, NUT CRUSHER, until a body guard came and tackled me. I woke up the next day in the same spot.",1454198400,,1484,4.120689655172414

Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman do such a great job as some of the main characters.....Of course these two always do their very best in whatever project they are in. Ian McShane was just the perfect voice for the evil character.

1157137,4,7880879625,"I wasn't entirely sure how I would feel about this movie, but since I had a free promo code, I figured I would get it! I am not typically a fan of Jack Black but I had heard good things about this movie. This movie was hilarious! As I said before, I had no expectations for it, so that most likely helped. It was a great comedy mixed with emotion and action, playing to all ages. Jack Black is the perfect actor to play Po. Po is a character that everyone can relate to as he laughs at himself, has misadventures, and dreams of what he wants. The character is actually developed very well, something that cannot be said about a lot of movies. I also really like the other two main characters played by Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane as the other good and bad guys. I really like the landscaping and visual effects of this movie. The settings in China are so beautiful with the mountains and bodies of water.

Overall, this is a great movie that is beautiful to look at for all ages.",1453939200,,982,4.251336898395722

My son loves this movie, he just turned 3 and will watch this everyday, sometimes multiple times a day :) It is a cute and funny story about a clumsy panda who becomes a Kung Fu master. I think it has some good lessons about learning that just because someone is different or doesn't fit YOUR idea of what they should be like doesn't mean they should be shut out or shunned. Animals (anybody) should be excepted for who they are and never underestimate the potential they may have when given a chance.

With the new Kung Fu Panda coming out its a must to watch all the old ones and walk through a memory late before you watch the new one!!!

The 1 hour and 34 minutes will keep you laughing and really enjoying this movie!! Extremely kid friendly, cute, and inspiring!!

Many times childrens movies are just full of adult innuendos.  This has some, but not a lot.  I do recommend for children and adults alike.  Even as a cartoon this is full of action as well as comedy.  I laughed a lot.  And even the action brought some intensity.  The story line went well and kept interest throughout.  Especially with the 3rd one coming out you should get if you don't have and do a quick review of number one and number two.  Another major pro that I have for this movie is the length.  It is right at ninety minutes, that is a great amount of time for both kids and adults.  I know 2 hours is only 30 minutes longer than 90, but it seems that a 90 minute movie is just right.",1453852800,,823,4.132911392405063

1158386,5,7880879625,"I cannot remember how but this movie was offered to me for free through my Amazon prime account.  My kids have always loved this movie and it is good to have.  This is a streaming version, so you must be connected to the internet to be able to view through your Amazon account.  I like to stream movies now now then own dvd, even more so with kid movies.  I can't tell you how many movies I have had to throw away due to scratches on the dvds.  This will never be the case with this film.

I have never had a problem with Amazon having buffering issues.  If you do it is probably the internet,s fault.  Some hotels offer free wifi but it is too slow to stream.  Check to see if they have an upgraded package for streaming, you will probably have to pay for it though.  But traveling with kids and not having entertainment isn't an issue if you have an internet device with internet anymore if you own streaming movies.  Gone are the days of forgotten movies at home and crying kids wanting something to do or watch when you are trying to get them to relax and unwind.

As for the movie if you have not seen Kung Fu Panda, it is a dream works film and it much follows dream works other works.  Great animation, good story line and fun family movie to watch together.",1453680000,,1265,4.199170124481328

Kung Fu Panda is a 2008 American/British computer-animated action comedy martial arts film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It was directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne and produced by Melissa Cobb, and stars the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Randall Duk Kim, James Hong, Dan Fogler Michael Clarke Duncan, and Jackie Chan. Set in a version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic talking animals, the plot revolves around a bumbling panda named Po who aspires to be a kung fu master. When an evil kung fu warrior is foretold to escape from prison, Po is unwittingly named the chosen one destined to bring peace to the land, much to the chagrin of the resident kung fu warriors.[1]

The idea for the film was conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animation executive. The film was originally intended to be a parody, but director Stevenson decided instead to shoot an action comedy wuxia film that incorporates the hero's journey narrative archetype for the lead character. The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. As with most DreamWorks animated films, Hans Zimmer (collaborating with John Powell this time) scored Kung Fu Panda. He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the China National Symphony Orchestra as part of his preparation. A sequel, Kung Fu Panda 2, was released on May 26, 2011, along with a television series, Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness later that same year as a part of a franchise. The third installment called Kung Fu Panda 3 will debut in January 2016.

Kung Fu Panda premiered in the United States on June 6, 2008, and has since received favorable reviews from critics and much of the movie-going public. The film garners an 87% ""Certified Fresh"" approval rating from review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Kung Fu Panda opened in 4,114 theaters, grossing $20.3 million on its opening day and $60.2 million on its opening weekend, resulting in the number one position at the box office. The film became DreamWorks' biggest opening for a non-sequel film, the highest grossing animated film of the year worldwide, and also had the fourth-largest opening weekend for a DreamWorks animated film at the American and Canadian box office, behind Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and Shrek Forever After.",1453507200,,2669,4.9932584269662925

1158944,4,7880879625,"I got around to seeing ""Kung Fu Panda"" this year, when Amazon offered it as a special freebie for a limited time to Prime customers. Like many of the classic kung-fu movies to which ""Panda"" pays tribute, its comedy is mildly amusing and sometimes wince-inducing. The fight sequences are excellent. Then comes the final showdown between Po, the hero, and Tai Lung, the principal villain--this is where the movie really earns its stars from me. It's an inspired, rapid-fire parade of sight gags that hearkens back to the classic mid-20th Century animated shorts of Chuck Jones, Tex Avery and the Fleischer Brothers, and it brought out loud belly laughs from me watching those two careen around Peace Valley in a fight over a scroll whose message only one of the combatants understands.",1453420800,,783,4.9393939393939394

1159113,5,7880879625,"I got this video for free due to some purchases I made and wasn't sure if I would watch it.  I read reviews on it and they convinced me that I wanted to watch it.  Then, I had to convince my wife to watch it with me.  She's not into cartoons (I'm not much either) but the premise and such threw her off.  Finally she agreed to sit down and watch it with me.

Wow. What a fun movie!  I wanted to watch it again right after I watched it the first time, but needed to get some sleep.  If you have little children that are scared because of loud noises and things, then it might be best not to let them watch it.  Otherwise, it's a great & fun movie.  It was quite enjoyable.

I wish that I could say this of all of the other movies out there, in particular ones for children, but I can't.  You can tell that there was a lot of thought that went into the design of the movie, the script, and final cut.  I hope to see another movie like this someday.

What I find annoying is you can only play the movie through the amazon player. I was expecting to get a full digital download that can be played with any video player software. I would be really ticked if I had actually paid for it. I would rather buy the physical blu-ray disk that I could then play on whatever platform I want.
The other annoying thing was I could not get HD resolution when playing it from my PC hooked up to the TV via HDMI cable. Why should that be? The hdmi hookup should be ensuring that DRM was all in order. To get HD, I ended up having to play it from the TV's amazon player app which is really clumsy to operate.

Just think of the scathing review you could imagine yourself writing about the inept plot, the plodding characters, the stilted dialogue, the dreary prose used to describe the setting ... You get the idea.

If you are the social type, have a conversation with a friend or group of friends. INTERACT AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO WHAT IS BEING SAID!! God forbid you might  learn something.

If you are a parent, read your children a book. SPUR THEIR IMAGINATIONS! As the story develops ask them questions like: what do you think will happen next; why do you think that character is doing that; if you wrote the story what would your ending be ...

Simple, fun story, really nothing much to it. So it's not at the level of a ""Lion King / Finding Nemo"" kind of story, but fun nonetheless.
This leads to some funny quotes we reuse at home.
Fun trivia: Master ShiFu. Shifu is master in Chinese. So the name would be ""master master"" if translated :-)
Master Oogue (not sure how to write that one either) is a Turtle, and his name means turtle in Chinese :-)",1453075200,,482,4.138297872340425

Be advised...this show has some redeeming value. Rejects evil. Rejects revenge. Undermined by some elements that promote self-determination in the absence of a moral perspective based on something greater than themselves.

Romantic and Humanistic with some redemptive elements without any acknoledgement of something outside of their plane of existence.",1453075200,,497,6.0

1160837,5,7880879625,"I used to see this movie being advertised and I thought I would hate it. I also couldn't stand Jack Black back then so he ruined it for me even more. However, when Kung Fu Panda 2 came out, my husband begged me to watch it in the theater with him and I agreed to do so. I wanted to watch this one first so I would know what was going on in the second one though. I am so glad I did! This movie is so funny! I love the panda and all of the other characters. This movie actually made me like Jack Black to a decent extent and I thought he played the part of Po (the panda) incredibly well. I think Kung Fu Panda 2 is funnier than this one, but this one is still great.

I have a daughter now who is three and this is one of her favorites. She loves pandas now because of this movie and she named her stuffed panda Po. She laughs so hard at some of the parts. We can't wait for Kung Fu Panda 3 to come out later this month. It will be the first movie she ever sees in the theater.

This movie is great for all ages. I really enjoy it as an adult and my daughter has enjoyed it ever since she first watched it when she was two. The humor is clean and I didn't notice any hidden sexual innuendo like I do in other kids' movies. Po is an out of shape panda who only seems to care about food and his favorite kung fu heroes. He ends up being able to work with his kung fu heroes even though he's so useless. That's where all of the humor comes in. There is violence in this movie because it's a kung fu movie, but it's mostly humorous violence and nothing scary or gory. It's great for the entire family, no matter what age and no matter what sex. I think it has some great lessons in it too.",1452816000,,1685,3.867052023121387

It's got an all star cast (some actors you may not even notice until you look it up, well I had to after I saw it the first time in theaters when it came out. I didn't have a smart phone yet and went in seeing zero trailers which is how I prefer to see films.)

The code is a never ending joke of frustration, if you use a Kindel Fire. And once you finally get it typed I t o the magic shrinking box, that automatically dumps you back at home page and erases your entry, if you mistakenly make the slightest error entering the ridiculous 16 digit promo code.
Also the brilliant software designer has the codex copy protected, so you can't cut and paste it.

Sorry Amazon, this is my pet peeve, and you get a solid thumbs down for this nonsense.

The only reason I give one star is because there isn't a raspberry emoticon offered to use.

You can bet I'll consider ordering more from the box stores in 2016.

1162995,5,7880879625,"Having just gotten a 4K UHD TV with passive 3D technology this Winter, I've been collecting and watching A LOT of 3D movies - especially animated ones. I own everything Disney and most of Pixar, but it wasn't until browsing the 3D section at Best Buy that I started collecting select films from Dreamworks. Having never seen this film before, I picked it up to watch with my sister and nephew on New Year's Eve since she said it was one of her all-time favorites. I was sceptical and figured it wouldn't be all that good - boy was I wrong.

This is EASILY one of the most beautifully animated films I have ever seen in my life - and the 3D is so expertly executed that it puts most other animated 3D films to shame. Dreamworks takes full advantage of the format in a flawless way that does not feel gimicky and rather adds to the emotion and excitement of each scene. Seeing this in 3D is nothing short of breath-taking from start to finish, my jaw hit the floor multiple times. There's so much comedy, action and genuine heart in this movie, and it's all balanced so perfectly with the pacing - it's the perfect example of a truly remarkable animated family film.

In conclusion, if you have a 3D TV, this is one of the best animated films you can get to really show off the format without subjecting yourself or others to mediocre story telling. I haven't watched part two yet, but I snagged that in 3D too and I'm itching to pop it in tonight. And if you find yourself wanting more quality 3D films from the studio, How to Train Your Dragon parts one and two are more great examples of amazing story telling and 3D animation done right. Disney really needs to step up their game; their presence in the Blu-ray 3D department is virtually non-existent, and both Dreamworks and Sony Pictures Animation are really dominating the format on home video with quality releases and a generous amount of re-pressings so that consumers aren't paying sky-high second-hand prices.",1451606400,,1969,4.543661971830986

Since your account should have an automated redeemable code, simply purchase the HD movie and there shouldn't be a charge. In the possible event that you are charged, contact customer service and have proof of the code at hand in case. It took me a whole two minutes to start watching Kung Fu Panda which was a fantastic Dream Works production. My only disappointment was that it can't be downloaded from Amazon and moved onto my personal hard drive, it can only be viewed from your Amazon account.

THIS copy sits in the cloud somewhere and I can't download it to watch on my laptop. NOOOOOO. I need a ""supported device"" evidently for that. I guess my homemade quaint little htpc running Windows 7 isn't compatible enough?. Looky here Amazon - my video library is on my media server. If I can't put this movie on my media server so that it can stream to my devices then it isn't mine, and I don't own s*** except for the right to open a browser and navigate to some website to watch your movie. Why would anyone want to do that ? I don't keep my library on Amazon and how would I watch this on the plane anyways with no internet? No one wants to search 43 different locations where their movie might be. And I really don't want to open a browser to watch a movie anyways.

1164070,4,7880879625,"The strength of this film is all on the performances.  And the voice cast does a surprisingly good job of performing their roles well.  And even though it does feel like a Jack Black vehicle, it downstream like it's just about Jack Black.

I'm grading this movie mostly on how my nephew enjoyed it.  By his own admission, it's not a favorite of his.  He saw it for the first time yesterday, and although he enjoyed most of it, he was bored during some stretches of the movie.  I think the movies very simpme story might actually be a knock against it for its intended audience.

Regardless though, it's a fun movie in spirit, that keeps it's energy up through most of the film.  And the characters are all very well realized, even if some of them don't get much to do.

Like I said, strongest point was in the voice acting.  Even though this was more names over actual voice talent, they all did pretty well with the roles that they were given.  I was full expecting an awful DreamWorks styled shove any minor celebrity we can in this film in spite of the fact that they aren't very good at voice acting extravaganza.  But this movie managed to reign that back quite a bit.

Overall, I'd recommend it for the kids.  It does enough to stay entertaining for younger audiences.  And it isn't so annoying as to become unwatchable for the older viewers too.",1451260800,,1352,4.439024390243903

It was recommended to people who enjoyed ""How To Train Your Dragon"", so I watched it, and next bought the Blu-ray.  This Dragon Warrior is like the little brother of ""Dragon"".  I'm rating the digital download, so I take into account the fact that there's a trailer for KFP3 at the beginning that can't be bypassed as you may with a disc.  This streaming video was a ""free"" promotional, maybe that's why.  You must fast-forward 2:30 minutes to skip the trailer.  I'll be hesitant to buy future downloads from Amazon.com.

One of their favorites being this movie. It brings laughter and keeps them entertained throughout the duration of the movie which allows me to sit back and focus on studying.

It took a couple more viewings before we could honestly say that we liked it.  This is not a go-to movie for our family.

The AMAZON PROMOTION ITSELF on December 19th, however, is NOT WORKING for multiple people, while some lucky ones seem to have no problems.  (I would rate THAT EXPERIENCE a 1-star!!!  It's unfortunate people are poorly rating the MOVIE instead of amazon, when it's not the movie's fault or reflection that amazon sent out bogus codes to numbers of people.)

I followed the step-by-step instructions (which were a little convoluted and not very user friendly I might add), but each and every time I attempted to apply the code I was given in the e-mail, I received the following message:

""The claim code you entered isn't working. Please ensure there are no spaces and try again. If this problem continues, please contact Amazon Customer Service at Video Help and refer to error 2039.""

Yes, I double and triple checked there were no spaces - I even tried removing the hyphens just to see if it would make a difference.  It appears multiple people are getting error codes.

As for the PROMO, I'm not easily confused, and yes it was easy per se. However, it -is- more tricky than the usual promo codes on Amazon and other sites. You have to enter the promo code, it says it's applied so clearly you think it's in your movie watch list already. Wrong. You then have to ""purchase"" it and you won't know you have the movie until Amazon sends you an email and you look at the total and see they indeed added the promo code and it worked.

I went to redeem it (BTW if you go to order it, breathe take your hand off the mouse or away from the touch screen and look. There is a small light blue line of text that says ""More Purchase Options"" NOW touch that or click it, THEN hit ""Redeem Gift Card or Promotion Code"" BREATHE stop clicking fast on boxes that say go or click here, READ. Enter your code, if you get an error that means the code is already in. NOW the leap of faith method  applies.) I got the error and READ that others said to just go through with the purchase and the promotion discount will apply. It took me like 3 minutes to READ that. So I did what they posted and voila! Free movie that is really entertaining and funny regardless of being FREE! Funny thing is I already own it on DVD and BR but now my kids can download them to their tablets and watch it whenever to get pumped for number 3. Yes you can download videos from Amazon that you own. Google. READ. Ive been able to read instructions since third grade, my oldest is smarter than me and could read in first grade.

If I had clicked ""other purchase options"" the FIRST time, maybe it would have worked, but I cancelled my order, and THEN went back to click ""other purchase options"", and at that point, my promo code would not work.

So I went to ""help"". and, as always, my situation was not addressed in the any of the FAQ's, and finding out how to send a message to support is like finding a good Adam Sandler movie- not impossible, but not easy, either.

1165958,4,7880879625,"For the longest time, I saw ads for ""Kung Fu Panda"" and thought, ""Oh my gosh--that's going to be an awful movie.""  Generally speaking, martial arts movies for kids don't work out well (""3 Ninjas,"" ""Sidekicks,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2,"" anyone?), so figured this would be more of the same.  Having been on a bit of a martial arts kick (pun intended) lately, I saw that ""Kung Fu Panda"" had actually gotten pretty decent reviews, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

Definitely not the best animated movie (""Spirited Away"") or the best martial arts movie (""The Karate Kid,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") I've seen, but it's certainly fun, and Jack Black's Po is a likeable character.  I really like that Po's father is a duck, and that all the movie's characters are animals of one sort or another.  It's a nice nod to the ""animal"" styles of Kung Fu, which really do exist.  The movie's central lesson--""The secret is that there is no secret""--is spot-on as well.  It's good for children to realize that there's no shortcut to getting what they want, but that hard work, belief in one's self, and using one's strengths (even if they are humor, cooking, and the ability to jump ten feet in the air for cookies) are how to find happiness in life.

Definitely worth your time.",1436054400,,1279,4.628318584070796

With amazing animation sequences, background score, magnificent backdrops that highlight Chinese art and culture plus, superb and hip dialogues with the voice characterizations portrayed by Jack Black (Po) and James Hong (as Po's father), powerful proverbial notes from Dustin Hoffman (Master Shifu) and Randall Kim (as Master Oogway) besides a heart-felt storyline; the movie has great repeat viewing quality and shines in it's own right as one of the best animation movies of all time!",1420848000,,837,4.819444444444445

I really liked this movie as it takes the average character and thrusts them into a role or situation that requires greatness.  It presents the story that dreams can come true and that everyone can learn something from someone else, no matter how ordinary the person or how extraordinary the person may be that you're learning from.  It also presents the theme of teamwork and support.  I like the humor that this movie injects with Jack Black as Po.  It has the emotional ups and downs that any good animated film requires to capture people of all age ranges.  The scenery and graphics are also very well put together and it's easy to be fully captivated by the story.  Overall a great movie for all ages.",1378339200,,769,4.569343065693431

The witty humour, the hidden adult humour, the fight sequences, the visuals, and the storytelling, are all small parts that come together to make this movie one to remember.

When I try to watch it from my Kindle or computer, I get the message above in quotes and am prompted to purchase the video again. I get the same message for my purchase of Madagascar 2.  Thank you Amazon and or Dreamworks for stealing your video back and depriving my daughter from her movies.

1166949,1,7880879625,I downloaded this movie and I have had it for slightly over 1 month I went to watch it while driving down the road and amazon has lost there licensing for this for me to watch it digitally on my kindle fire. Now there telling me even thought I bought the movie and I own it I can no longer watch it due to they have temporarily lost licensing to this. This is like if I went to walmart and I bought a dvd and they showed up to my house and said they lost the licensing to sell it they have to take it back. this is very disappointing and when speaking to the reps which is not there fault they basically say this is amazons policy this is how it works buying digital movies even thought you buy and own them you can no longer watch the movies because they lost rights.

1167029,3,7880879625,"i've never watched this movie despite having seen it airing on cable (changed the channel). i thought since it is dreamworks and 3d, i will probably enjoy it. instead, there were only a few funny moments for me. i didn't find any part of the plot particularly touching besides the brief story between shifu and the cub. dreamworks movies always have a heartfelt spark to them, and this movie was seriously lacking. the 3d didn't wow me except in two scenes (fireworks rocket and flying petals). so ultimately, i feel disappointed in this blind buy and regret spending so much money on this 3d blu.

there are too many cliches about chinese culture in this movie and it is hard to like this panda. none of the characters were memorable or well developed besides shifu. maybe because i do not like jack black much, i did not care for this movie. if you are amused by stereotypical comedies like american pie, dumb and dumber, meet the fockers, or whatever....this might be for you. children will most likely enjoy it though.",1368576000,,1022,4.677777777777778

Weird licensing issues: we wanted to buy rather than rent, but we were informed that the license rights change later this summer. Essentially it said that either download to a compatible device by X date or lose access. It wasn't clear if this meant that the movie was tied to the specific device at that point--do you lose it altogether if the device breaks or you have to reinstall your OS? Such issues make me less confident in other Amazon video purchases in the future.

Kung Fu Panda (1) was funny, acerbic, witty, sad, and completely enthralling! Watching a roly-poly panda begin to learn kung-fu is side-splitting, especially for those of us who are a bit roly-poly ourselves! :)

The voices for the various characters could not be more spot on. Jack Black has raised the bar for animation voices so high I'm not sure it will ever be beat!!! (I will add an aside here for Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum/Smeagol in LOTR however, although, technically, I don't consider that ""animation"" such as this. Gollum was on another level entirely!)

One slight note of caution; 1 of my granddaughters is 2 1/2, and I think this may be just a little too much fighting for her. It should be fine for 4 or 4 1/2 +, though.",1358380800,,993,4.385869565217392

However when I found out that a 3D version of this original Kung Fu Panda movie had been released, I initially hesitated to purchase it - mostly because of a lack of reviews for that version - but now that I have seen the 3D Blu-ray I cannot understand why there are not dozens of rave reviews for it. My brother and I have over thirty 3D Blu-rays, and I reckon that the quality of 3D design here is certainly as good as in Up! (which is my standard for excellence in that format). Kung Fu Panda is a wonderful story which is ideal for all ages - being heart warming, inspiring, engaging and highly entertaining. It has a magnificent sound design (especially in surround) and every frame of every scene is pure art - made all the more appreciable in 3D. Naturally I highly recommend the Kung Fu Panda Blu-ray 3D.",1358294400,4,1003,4.3121693121693125

1167123,5,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda is a gem in that it is inspirational, uplifting, deep, and hysterically funny. It also helps that the stars voicing the characters are all amazing actors whose talents add the perfect touch to this well-crafted film.

The film follows ""Po,"" a bumbling Panda Bear voiced by Jack Black who seeks a different Path than that of his master chef father. Through chance/fate (""there are no accidents""---quote), Po becomes a novice disciple of a stern, inner-peace-seeking shifu who cannot quite fathom how to turn Po into one of his prodigies. The following ""training"" sessions designed to toughen Po (or send him bouncing down the stairs back to his old life) are a combination of slap-stick humor and well-written puns and come-backs.

The other martial artists are Tigress, Crane, Monkey, Mantis, and Python. Each is well-versed in their art, each has a different specialization (the speed of python, the power of Tigress). They tolerate Po but feel that his presence is a mistake. Yet, the decision of the elderly Tortoise sage to stand by Po and the legend of the Dragon Scroll makes them both curious about Po and defiant at the same time.

There are several scenes that remind of the Tao Te Ching, as translated by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English. The issue of excessive pride reminds me of verse 3, line 1: ""not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling."" The issue of nothingness reminds me of verse 11, lines 3 and 4: ""shape clay into a vessel; it is the space within that makes it useful."" The issue of Po's humiliation reminds of verse 13, line 1: ""accept disgrace willingly."" If one listens to the script of Kung Fu Panda, the lessons are imbedded in the story. Beautiful, deep, articulate.

Lastly, the story is uplifting, through humor, story development, and heart. Wisdom is imbedded like so many seeds of Peach trees throughout the soil of the story (film reference to the scene of the Tortoise sage and the shifu).

Just a side note, I prefer action movies, dramas, and thrillers. I watch these kid's movies only because my mother loves them. I went into this film fidgeting and sighing about how I had to sit through it, but afterwards, I was grateful and in a good mood.

I highly recommend Kung Fu Panda if you have kids or if you do not have kids. It works for everyone. I am smiling right now just remembering the scene where Po finds Monkey's stash of cookies on the top shelf. It will make sense once you see the movie!",1356739200,,2447,4.67906976744186

1167189,5,7880879625,"But then I saw this movie in theaters and was blown away. It's funny, yes, but so much more than that. There are many things about this film that I appreciate, such as the fact that all characters in the movie are endemic Chinese species, that the music is delightfully correlated to the film's visuals, and that watching Po's struggle, and more importantly, the struggle of a weathered but wise Master Shifu, was on a psychological level very interesting. I felt that the pace of their turnarounds were realistic, and it all came together in the end. Po may be fat, but it makes sense that a thick-skinned panda would be required to defeat Tai Lung because apparently the layers of adipose protect him from the villain's famed nerve attacks.

But when an actual Kung Fu master tells you he watched it and liked it.  You tend to open your mind.

This is not only a fun movie about accepting who you are, it actually talks about and demonstrates the true beauty of martial arts.  A lot of which will probably go over the 10 and under heads, but I still appreciate the positive message.  It's so rare in movie these days to see that with out it becoming to drama heavy.

Side note:  I do not appreciate the W.O.W commercials making me think a KFP 3 was coming out.  Don't toy with emotions like that.  ;)",1352160000,,665,4.125
1167193,4,7880879625,"There are some adoption issues in Kung Fu Panda that get more fully addressed in the sequel. In this movie, what we see is that Po is a panda bear. His father is a goose. Po's father points to portraits of various ancestors, and they are all geese. While Po's adoption is not directly addressed, it is hinted at lightheartedly; Po expresses that sometimes he ""can't believe"" that he is the son of his father. Mr. Ping hints at telling Po something that Po should have known for a long time, but ultimately shares a secret family recipe rather. In the next movie, Po and Mr. Ping discuss adoption; for now, we're just left with an uncomfortable ""non-dealing"" with the issue.

The villain of the movie also was adopted, at least to some extent: Tai Lung was found and raised by Shifu. Although adoption is not mentioned by name, Shifu took Tai Lung in, and raised him like a son. Shifu believed that Tai Lung would be appointed Dragon Warrior, but Shifu's master Oogway saw darkness in Tai Lung (we're never told the reasons). Tai Lung became bitter, turned on Shifu, and was imprisoned. He returns to his former home for revenge.

A main thrust of the movie seems to be Po's identity development. He doesn't like who he is. He wants to be someone else. Some of his questions are probably rooted in his adoption. In this movie, the question: ""Can I be someone else?"" is answered with ""Who you are is fine.""

I will admit, I didn't quite enjoy the way the Five treated Po when he first got to the palace, particularly Tigress, but I like how they changed their minds about him over time. I expected Shifu to hate Po as well and he did know he had to change his ways toward Po when Oogway died. Tai Lung is a pretty cool villain too. He actually reminds me a lot of Shere Khan from ""Jungle Book"". I don't know what else to say about this movie. I just love it so much!",1351209600,,918,4.105555555555555

But I'd give anything to be this way-awesome master of way-awesome beatdown skills (on all those guys who beat me down, at least), as long as it isn't too hard. Heck, I'd take a fair beating too - not like I haven't done it before - as long as the cool guys let me hang with them.

If you're still with me, then KFP is your ultimate fantasy. The golden goal is to find that unique power that each of us has within. Yeah, and everybody wins the race and gets a hug at the end. But maybe, just maybe, that one thing about you really can stand tall in some squirrely place in the world. Then, you are Po. Po Panda.

Perhaps there's a reference here to Li Po, the classic drunken poet - perhaps not. I really don't care. It's just a fun flick with lots of satire on the traditional ""work hard forever"" themes that don't work so well in the current decade. Po is the guy you really want to like, even if he's ... well, y'know, not so hard-working.

The animation matches the best of today's, and voice casting backs up the animated characters as well as any. My one kvetch, and little, is that Angelina Jolie's voice was way too smooth for Master Tigress. My ears just kept looking for a rocky rasp that her honeyed soprano never delivered. My problem, not yours, not hers.

As long as you don't take the martial arts too seriously, this is a charming and humorous riff on taking them seriously. See it and laugh at it. If you can be polite about all the rest, it's warm fuzzy fun.

1167206,3,7880879625,"I must admit, I am a kung fu fan and grew up watching them in Chinese (eyes skipping to English bu if they had subtitles).  But being that this is animation certain expectations must be lowered.

Great animation, good story line in Kung Fu Panda.  I was pleasantly surprised what a fun movie this was.  We always expect the kung fu here to be a lithe, fast and furious character.  Not so here.  I think that's what made this so entertaining is that the hero is a chubby panda.

I can't say that I loved the casting.  I'm not so crazy about Jack Black's voice which seems a bit passionless and more so in Kung Fu Panda 2.  That is too bad since he is the main character. But James Hong stole the show with his range of emotion and infectious energy.

I liked the story but too bad that most kids movies are so predictable and this falls into that category.  I don't want to ruin the plot for you but I think they could have done the feel good ending a little better.  I really like the way that Brad Bird writes his animated movies.

1167327,5,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda was a cute story with some interesting messages told in a back-drop of martial arts mania.

The panda is Po, a lazy bear whose father (a duck! -- they never explain that, which is humorous in itself) runs a noodle shop.  Their family has had many generations of noodle shops and he looks forward to the day when Po can take over the family business.

But Po has other dreams.  He is the martial arts warrior looked up to by all.  He is the kung fu master who beats all enemies.  But then he wakes up, admires his action figures and goes back to work selling soup.

I really liked how the story unfolded, with Po meeting his stars of the kung fu world, working with them and being elated to even see them.  But Tigress, Viper, Crane, Mantis and Monkey are less than thrilled when Po is named the Dragon Warrior.

Themes:

Pop philosophy make its way into this film as other animated features of this type.  There is the past which is history, tomorrow hasn't happened yet, so all you have is the NOW.  And the NOW is a gift, that's why it's called ""present.""  Cooool!

All fun aside, I did have to admire Po and his not wanting to give up -- he did at first -- and how the master also changed, realizing that Po, being a different kind of fighter needed a different kind of training.  The mixing of kung fu and dumplings was hilarious.

Bottom Line:  Great story, detailed animation and wonderful voice actors come together to make this a fun movie to watch and learn from.  Martial arts purists might whine and complain, missing the point of this light bit of entertainment.  Can't wait for the sequel!

When Kung Fu Panda was released in China, it was praised not only for the production values but its faithfulness to Chinese culture. Suddenly people in China were asking, how can an American production company outdo their Chinese counterparts in creating an animated film that sends such a positive message about China and gets everything right? It's akin to the Russians who launched the first man into space, only to see the American overtake them, eventually landing a man on the moon. For many Chinese critics, Kung Fu Panda is the American 'first lunar landing' of animated martial arts movies.

But if the Chinese critics only had a bit of critical acumen, they could easily see there's nothing to be jealous about here. Sure there's a great amount of respect for Chinese culture seen throughout the film (down to the last Chinese character in the credits) as well as some sensational animation including the opening anime 'dream' sequence as well as that incredibly difficult feat of having tons of realistic looking confetti pour down at the Kung Fu tournament where the Kung Fu Panda, Po, is crowned Dragon Warrior. But how is Chinese culture honored by turning Chinese people into a bunch of goofy, self-effacing anthropomorphic animals? Surely kids under eight will dig it, but adults? I hardly think so.

While the directors of 'Panda' are firmly ensconced in the world of martial arts and action adventure films, they are neophytes when it comes to comedy. It all comes down to one silly slapstick scene after another emphasizing Po as a good natured, bumbling fool with a decided inferiority complex. Whether he fails getting up the steps into the arena for the Kung Fu tournament, or shoots himself high into the air strapped to a bunch of fireworks and then unceremoniously falling straight down and landing inside the arena, only to be crowned Dragon Warrior, the idea that we should fall in love with his lovable loser is spelled out from the beginning and repeated ad infinitum. How many times do we have to see Po chucked around like an inflatable doll whether it's by Master Shifu, Villain Tai Lung or when he finds himself caught inside the mechanical torture chamber, a device that Shifu's Dragon Warrior candidates, 'The Furious Five', in contrast, have mastered.

I do confess that Master Shifu's 'epiphany' in realizing that he has to train Po in a different way so that he can succeed as the dragon warrior, might have been the most clever moment in the comic arc of the film. And certainly Po's transformation from self-effacing masochist to gleeful aggressor as he embraces his 'appetite', is a welcome plot twist after being subjected to the one joke idea of Po as a bumbling clown. Yes, there's finally a method to Po's madness, as Tai Lung is unable to harness Po's new found manic energy. It's sort of like a dominant major league batter unable to master the completely unpredictable path of a knuckle ball.

But if we view Po as representing a grownup who still acts like a kid with the particularly bad habit of overeating, then the message 'be yourself', should fall on deaf ears. In this day where smart educators are trying to control the epidemic of childhood obesity, Po's unbridled enthusiasm for that extra cupcake, would not lead to his triumph as dragon warrior. It's a wishful conceit on the part of the directors that Po would end up victorious in his confrontation with the evil Tai Lung. The filmmakers' message to kids here is be happy even if you don't treat yourself well. And things will turn out alright even if you've made no effort to change yourself.

As for the action adventure aspect of 'Panda', I can't help it if it seems that the 'holy trinity' of Shifu, Oogway and Tai Lung, are pilfered straight out of the Star Wars play book. Shifu appears to be a Yoda stand-in with the wise, all-knowing tortoise Oogway, reprising the Obi-Wan Kenobi role (Oogway appears to employ his own version of 'The Force' as he is responsible for turning the slight Red Panda Master Shifu into a powerhouse). Finally, Tai Lung can go toe to toe with Darth Vadar any day as both have no problems mixing erudition with brute force.

A good deal of 'Panda' is taken up by one Kung Fu sequence after another and you really have to be a martial arts fan to be enamored with all those repetitious action sequences. Less bothersome (but still silly) was the decision to make Po's father, Mr. Ping, a goose. There's also the Wuxi Finger Hold that leads to Tai Lung's destruction (at first it seems like a nuclear explosion but it really is a clearing out of 'bad energy' or 'bad karma'). Finally, The 'Furious Five' are not distinct enough as characters despite the conscription of such luminaries as Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan to perform the voice overs.

I think 'Kung Fu Panda' would have been a better film had the films' scenarists decided from the outset not to make Po into such a hapless buffoon. That would have also probably meant that the sentimental Mr. Ping and his love for noodles had to go too. In its present incarnation, Kung Fu Panda is certainly suitable for kids (although Tai Lung's antics might be too strong a draught for children under eight). As for adults, ignore the dopey screenplay and concentrate on the visuals and the music, which certainly deserve the accolades already garnered throughout the film community since the film's release in 2008.",1308528000,,5455,4.777306468716861

This movie has no crude or vulgar elements to it which for some reason many people my age have always thought to be funny. It is genuinely funny from beginning to end, has a great story, and is very beautifully done. There is always a message in it and Jack Black's character is not just another mindless, obnoxious character that are so many adored today. His character is very funny and has a great attitude throughout.
So again a movie that has no vulgarity and is genuinely funny with a lesson at the end...When else can you get that in a kid's movie nowadays? GREAT movie. Definite 5 stars",1308355200,,707,4.404580152671755

In animated film production, the voices are recorded first, and the animators ""draw"" to match them. This means that Jack (and all the actors) had to work from pure imagination.

It does have a few minor parts of crude humor, but where it excels is in its entertainment value, personality, and ultimate message about belief in fulfilling your goals or dreams.

There is a high 'star' voice-over list for this film, including Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan and they all do a great job bringing life to their various characters. It seems strange to ask Jackie Chan to do a voice over as he is a very physical actor and was barely used in this film, but it lends the film some martial arts kudos I guess. This is a good film for kids and is fun enough to keep parents interested as well. At just under 90 minutes it's not too long so kids will lose their attention or parents will get bored. It does what it sets out to do well, be a fun animated adventure, but there are better animated films out there and this has a great deal to live up to (hence the 3 stars).

1167423,4,7880879625,"I love this movie. It's not perfect, but it's darn good. It's sort of an animated Karate Kid, set in ancient China (or some version of it) and starring animals...and the main character is a fat panda. Ok, so Karate Kid might be a stretch on the face of it. But it's that type of story.

* spoilers *

Po is a fat panda who dreams of being a great Kung Fu fighter. Instead, he's a food-aholic who has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. To top it off, he doesn't have the razor sharp claws and teeth that Tigress has, or the wings of Crane, or any of the other top fighters' abilities. Fate intervenes, however, when he is chosen as the Dragon Warrior who must protect the Valley of Peace from an escaped evil doer/super fighter. And, of course, he does it.

* end spoilers *

The first 30 or so minutes of the movie are not as good as the rest, I think. They rely more on ""fat humor"" (Po) and so-so jokes. Not that any of the first half hour is bad...just that, all of it combined, is a little too cheesy. There aren't really any witty jokes or clever bits to accompany the rest...if there was, this would be a lot better.

However, once the story picks up, it is very good. The fat humor is still used, but its more important to the story, so quite funny; and the cheesy jokes sort of disappear, which is also good.

All in all, this is a really good movie. Not quite 5/5 stars because of the first half hour, but a solid 4/5.",1290902400,2,1438,4.099644128113879
1167462,5,7880879625,"I work in the industry and just love this movie!  Even my tired, jaded old eyes are excited by it!
The story is great fun for people who love Kung Fu movies, but is also told in a way that makes it enjoyable to a broader audience.  It has great humour throughout that's fun and charming without having to go to the vulgar side.

The animation is top notch.  This is my area of expertise, and I just love the animation. The physical believability is very good, and on top of it, the movement has been stylistically well thought out to have interesting texture to the timing and look lively and beautiful.  The acting is very nicely done.  Also, the introduction is in the hand-drawn style.  It's graphically simple, yet sophisticated and powerful.  The end credits also have a strong graphic quality that's just fun to watch.

Other areas in which I'm not totally expert still have importance, and I know what I like.  The sense of design throughout the movie is strong and cohesive.  It's appealing and understandable.  The art direction is wonderful.  Very pretty pictures with good understanding of colour and tonal value that support and enhance the mood of each part of the movie.  You get totally drawn into that world.
The choreography of the fight sequences is beautifully thought out.  It's exciting and entertaining.  Even the more outlandish moves have a ring of truth and believability.

The part of the panda has got to have been written with Jack Black in mind.  Even if that weren't necessarily so, from the writing to the voice acting to the animation performance, the teamwork to get this character to be like this is tight.  His sensibility permeates the character.  And you like him from the start of the movie, which makes it so easy to be pulling for him all the way through.
The rest of the characters in the movie, from the old master tortoise to the adoptive father goose are beautifully done and a joy to watch. The all star cast of voice actors add a dimension of fun without distracting from the story.

Also, the craftsmanship of the DVD and it's case are...  ..well, they're standard, aside from the nice cover art,

1167464,4,7880879625,"This is a kids' film, with rather grotesque vaudeville antics, cheesy life lessons, and an impossible plot.  Nonetheless, there is absolutely no question that this works.  From the first image of the buffoon Panda, I knew intuitively that I would enjoy this film in the way that a child's mind can:  suspending my disbelief and surrendering myself to the experience, no matter how ridiculous.

Even though it checks all of the boxes:  ancient riddle wisdom, action acrobatics that are as mesmerizing as they are impossible, a deadly adversary that only the best can face, the destiny of dreams, and a training program for novices that transforms their lives both inside and outside.  Of course, there is the plucky neophyte, a most unlikely choice to join the greatest of warriors.  What's more, the established cadre does not want to accept the master's choice of the Panda, taking on a mission to reject and undermine him physically and psychologically.

The uberbad guy escapes and comes to claim his mantle as master.  Meanwhile, the Panda takes his training in spite of the challenges, proving his character for the coming battle.  The process is fun to watch and you believe it.  The buildup in tension is good and there is plenty of comic relief, even in decisive battles.

Warmly recommended.  This is great family entertainment.",1289001600,2,1337,4.995475113122172

1167466,5,7880879625,"This is a film with truly inventive three dimensional animation and a creative storyline that is full of life lessons for young and old. I was told that KUNG FU PANDA was ""very Zen,"" and it is. It's also fun to watch. It's anthropomorphic animal cast is endearing.

Po (voiced by Jack Black) is ""a big, fat panda"" from the Valley of Peace, who works in his Dad's noodle shop as a waiter. His Dad (voiced by James Hong) is a goose whose fondest wish is that his son follow him into the family business. Po's Dad is awaiting the glorious day when he can reveal to Po the secret ingredient in his Secret Ingredient Noodle Soup.

Po, for his part, dreams of being a Kung Fu warrior, and idolizes the Furious Five, a group of highly trained warriors taught by Master Shifu, a Red Panda (voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu's own Master, Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) is a wise old tortoise who warns Shifu that his renegade student Tai Lung (a Snow Leopard voiced by Ian McShane) will be returning to the Valley to exact vengeance against Shifu for having been passed over as the greatest warrior of all time, The Dragon Warrior. Oogway prophesies that the true Dragon Warrior will appear to defeat Tai Lung. Shifu, for his part, has none of the equipoise of Oogway. He is short-tempered and judgemental.

The Furious Five represent each of the major styles of Kung Fu. Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) is their leader. She is egotistical. Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross) who round out the group, each have small roles.

Comes the great day when Oogway is to name the Dragon Warrior, and the designate-presumptive, Tigress, is shocked to discover that Oogway picks the totally untrained, physically clumsy Po as The Dragon Warrior. The rest of the Furious Five are nonplussed. Shifu too, has great doubts about Oogway's choice. The group is rude to Po and mock him at every opportunity until Oogway commands Shifu to train Po. The secret to Po's training is contained in the mysterious Dragon Scroll, which only the Dragon Warrior may have, and which Tai Lung covets.

The animated action sequences are complex and realistic, breaking new ground in animation. The film is very visually appealing and captures a sense of a stylized Classical China beautifully. It is the storyline that truly shines, though, as the characters learn not to judge one's skills, talent and abilities---whether ally or  opponent or oneself---by appearances alone.

In the same vein as THE KARATE KID, KUNG FU PANDA is a great movie for everybody of any age.",1288396800,,2587,4.761160714285714

1167503,5,7880879625,"I'll admit that I usually shy away from films that seem to be showered in hype.  I like to march to the beat of my own drum when it comes to discovering an under-appreciated gem and yet still found myself intrigued by the glowing opinions surrounding DreamWorks' Kung Fu Panda.  Sure Jack Black was decent in Shark Tale and Eastern Philosophy would probably naturally lend itself to the notion of martial arts masters who just so happen to be adorable talking animals but come on! It can't be that great, right?  Wrong!

Until picking up Kung Fu Panda, I was pretty thoroughly convinced that aside from Shrek, DreamWorks was doomed to play second fiddle to Pixar in the world of computer generated animated feature films.  Kung Fu Panda manages to combine story originality, magnificent visuals and genuine humor so flawlessly that it is much to Pixar's detriment that they have nothing to offer in terms of competition.

KFP tells the tale of Po (Jack Black); a panda that works in a noodle restaurant owned by his father Mr. Ping (James Hong), who just so happens to be a goose. Po is a kung fu fanatic with secret dreams of becoming a great master in the discipline despite no prior training and a body style that favors weight and clumsiness.

The tortoise Master Oogway (played brilliantly by Randall Duk Kim) has a premonition that the evil snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), the former student of his own protg, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), will escape from prison and return to threaten the Valley of Peace.

Oogway orders a formal ceremony to choose the Dragon Warrior, a supreme master of kung fu and the one who can defeat the lethal Tai Lung should the premonition come to pass. It is assumed that one of the Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross) will be chosen for this honor.

Po, in attempt to simply spectate the event, finds himself smack dab in the middle of the ceremony. Oogway, surprised by the panda's sudden appearance, designates him the Dragon Warrior and hence Po is immediately in way over his head.

It's tough to come up with anything new to add to a film that has already been so thoroughly praised since its inception but that's no excuse for me to refrain from trying.  I was quite dazzled with Kung Fu Panda's solid homages to classic kung fu movies while simultaneously brining an original and attention-worthy story to the table.  Pacing, plot structure, and character development are all top notch through and through and the humor, which is often so natural as to appear nearly unintentional, is the icing on the proverbial cake.

It is often suggested that DreamWorks tends to release in quantity what Pixar does in quality but every once in a while a DreamWorks production manages to raise the bar for all of the other studios to attempt to follow.  The stars aligned a decade ago when Shrek was released and it would seem the studio has managed to find that magic once again in Kung Fu Panda.",1283644800,,3023,4.71157495256167

1167507,5,7880879625,"I absolutely love this movie. IT takes me back to many of the old Kung-fu movies I wish Hollywood still made.
The story follows Po (Jack Black). A young goofy Panda who works in a soup kitchen by his father side. His father eagerly awaits the day he will take over the soup kitchen, but Po has other dreams. Po wishes to one day become the strongest Kung-fu warrior there ever was and fight along the noctorious Furious Five.

I won't say more because I don't want to give away too much, but this is definately one of the best animated movies I've seen since the Incredibles. The cinemagraphy for the action scenes in this movie are intense and had me on the edge of my seat. There was one scene in particular I found myself just sitting and looking at in awe from just how brilliant it was. There was also a training segment that was just breathtaking in its visual style. Its very reminiscent of old Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and Jackie Chan movies. The movie itself looks extremely good. The lighting and detail made it fun to look at. I also found it clever that the all the furious Five are basically chosen and named after martial art styles. Don't even get me started on the main villian. He was definatly one of the best things about the movie. He was brutal, somewhat missunderstood because he was raised in a way that lead to his fall, almost unstoppable, and just powerful.  The story is actually kind of dark later on, but holds a message to it that I would expect in a martial arts movie like this.

 Even though I'm giving this 5 stars there is one thing in particular I didn't like. The Furious Five are voiced by Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, and other very familiar actors, but they are barely given any dialogue in the movie. Not only that they didn't really go too deeply into the characters of the Furious Five. I know theres a second bonus dvd that they were selling in Walmart with the movie (I actually own both) that tells thier backstory, but I would have still loved if thier characters were given more time on screen. If they make a sequal, and I really hope they do, I wish they would flesh out thier characters a little more.

 Kung-fu panda I admit won't be for everyone, expecially those who aren't into kungfu action films or overprotective parents who think anything that isn't barney level is too violent for kids. Kung-Fu Panda is a great homage to the action movies I love. Its original, fun, and just plain awesome. Its worth a buy for both children and adults to enjoy.",1281484800,,2499,4.4335511982570806

1167541,5,7880879625,"Dreamworks Animation's ""Kung Fu Panda"" will most likely be claimed as one of their classics. If not, then it should be. This film which stars Jack Black as Po (the panda) centers on a big fat Panda with hopes of being a master in Kung Fu, yes a panda and yes kung fu, you can't make this stuff up. He dreams of working with Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman)and the furious five -Tigress(Angelina Jolie), Viper(Lucy Lu), Monkey(Jackie Chan), Mantis(Seth Rogen), and Crane (David Cross). When Master Oogway(Randall Duk Kim) -a very spiritual and wise turtle- declares Po as the Dragon Warrior, Shifu and the furious five grow beyond angry that they not only have to train Po in Kung Fu but train him to defeat the legendary Tai Ling(Iam McShane)- the greatest, most powerful tiger there is. Can Po rise up and defeat Tai Ling or will Po, his family and the rest of the town suffer from the loss and destruction that Tai Ling will cause?

""Kung Fu Panda"" is definitely up there with one of my favorite animated movies. It's clever, unique, and funny. Jack Black is a delight, the audience just wants to root for him from the first second he appears on screen. He's fun and goofy and it's great to see his personality shine through an animated panda bear with just his voice. Dustin Hoffman and the furious five are all individually great in their animal fighting roles.

The story line is very original and packed with really great laughs. I love how they slow down certain kung fu parts to make it more dramatic but it winds up just being funny. I also love that Po's dad is a bird that makes noodles.

In my opinion I think this movie is awesome. It is wonderful for both children and adults. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys animated fun comedies, movies with a lot of heart and a wonderful message to send to children of all ages.

If you saw ""Kung Fu Panda"" please share your opinion! Just don't give away too much, we don't want to ruin it for anyone! Also, I hear they are making a sequel how do you feel about that??

1167543,5,7880879625,"Alright guys, it's official- animation delivers the laughs better than *any* other style of comedy.  This includes stand up routines, sitcoms with live studio audiences, or just your uncle Bob telling you a joke during a family visit.  Kung Fu Panda absolutely rules, and the animation is one of the main reasons why.

I've actually wanted to watch Kung Fu Panda for quite a while now.  I finally got the chance to watch it this afternoon.  It certainly lived up to all the hype it received a couple years ago.

What makes it so enjoyable is the fact that the laughs aren't the only exciting thing about Kung Fu Panda- it's the outrageous and zanny action segments that really elevate this film to a level of untouchable greatness.  We're talking a LOT of animated action here, folks.

The storyline is about a panda bear that's severely out of shape but dreams about becoming the ultimate master of kung fu fighting.

Eventually he's chosen to be given such a chance, with lots of special attention and guidance from his master (along with other friends).  Unfortunately his laziness constantly prevents him from ever reaching his dream... until a really evil wild cat comes into the equation and pretty much forces the panda bear to stand up and fight.

I don't know what's most awesome about Kung Fu Panda- the exciting action and fighting segments, the actual humor and jokes involving all the animated animals communicating with each other, or just the brilliantly executed animation frames themselves.

One thing's for sure- you simply MUST watch this movie.  Adults and children alike must watch it.  You'll be laughing hard and heavy, I guarantee it!",1278720000,,1658,4.875

Both touching and humorous, this is a great example of a creative and interesting movie perfect for family and friends of all ages.",1278374400,,489,5.363636363636363
1167545,5,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda is a very fun animated movie that I enjoy and my kids love. Po (nicely voiced by Jack Black) is an affable but somewhat overweight Panda that dreams of becoming a Kung Fu Master. Sadly, his lot in life seems to be making and selling noodles for his father (he was adopted) and all of the Kung Fu glory reserved for the ""Furious Five"" (who even have a line of action figures). All of that changes when chance lands him in the roll of the ""Dragon Warrior"" and his Kung Fu training begins in earnest... just in time to face the powerful escaped villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung (Ian McShane).

Like most martial arts movies, there is significant violence but it is mostly of the slapstick cartoon variety. There is a very positive message for kids that comes through loud and clear, don't judge people based on looks and preconceptions.

The animation is good and the voice acting is enjoyable with Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, David Cross, Lucy Liu and.

Highly Recommended!

  Jack Black is quite perfect, Hoffman and the rest equally fine, and the script is excellent. I really can't find much to not like about Kung Fu Panda, either for kids or adults. There's enough smart humor for the elders and enough eye candy for any fan of color, composition, and animation in general. The form is used to perfection and it's clear that we are in a golden age of animation right now; the classics are coming fast and furious.

It's also a very funny, wry movie, with sweet and snappy moments to spare.

This is bound to be one of the dvds that parents use to pacify their kids, for decades to come. If they have to be watching the boob tube instead of reading or doing something truly useful (""Such a nice day and you're watching Kung Fu Panda AGAIN?!""), this is about as good a thing for them to be tv zombies with as can be found.

With an influx of animation films to choose from this one was definitely a great find.  I think animation should be fun.  Animations should also have characters do 'stuff' that live characters cannot.  Kung Fu Panda has covered them all with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments with some beautifully exaggerated fight scenes. :)  Jack Black brought his distinct comedic style and gave this Panda character and adorable-ness as well as the agility deserving of a kung fu master.  I grew up in Hong Kong watching kung fu movies as a part of my regular TV routine and this movie did fantastically in covering the basics of the authentic kung fu film: The underdog who no one believes in, comes through and surprises everyone.  There's the serious, yet wise kung fu master.  And then there's the wiser kung fu master above him.  And of course the funny supporting cast.  Perfect.

1167605,5,7880879625,"I read all the other reviews with lots of details and insights. They were great!

Originally, I was NOT going to watch this movie - it seemed hokey from the previews.
It happened to be on HBO.
I watched it.
I'm HOOKED!!!!

I loved each and every bit of it!

I memorized dialog (""Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but Today is a gift - that is why it is called the 'present'."")

I sing the song (a re-make of the classic ""Kung Fu Fighting"" with Jack Black chiming in in the background).

I glance the online TV guide to see when it is on HBO or Cinemax.

It was only AFTER I watched it for the first time that I realized that one of the Directors (Mark Osborne) is the brother of one of my classmates from high school (Kent Osborne - who also adds voice talent to the movie). How cool is that?! Someone I actually knew created one of my more favorite movies!!

What I TRULY appreciate about this movie is that it didn't try to be ""politically correct"" in the portrayal of the lives of the villagers. I really felt like I was NOT being ""talked at"" during this movie.

What am I trying to say, here?

It felt like if I could visit this 'place' in real life, that it would look and function exactly like it does in this film. Like nothing was FAKE. Almost like I was actually GLIMPSING a ""real"" moment in time.

This DVD sits proudly on our DVD shelf, but has no dust on the cover. It is watched over and over again.

I can't wait for a sequel ... ! (yay!)

1167648,5,7880879625,"Most of the elements of this movie are done well, with one piece done REALLY well.  The storyline is frankly a little bland - Panda, working in dad's noodle shop, dreams of being a Kung-fu master.  When prophesy says that the more-or-less villainous Tai-Lung may escape from prison, Master Oogway decides to appoint a ""Dragon Warrior"" from amongst ""The Five"" masters:  Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Mantis (as in, praying), and Viper.  Inevitably Panda gets in the way of Oogway's pointing finger, and we follow Panda's journey in Kung Fu land.

The storyline may not be noteworthy but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it.  Panda (Jack Black) and his Kung-Fu teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) lead the movie and each are outstanding.  When the mysticism of Kung Fu begins to soar a little out of bounds, Black's blue-collar approach to Panda brings it back down to earth.  Panda, a slobbering fan of ""The Five"", is overwhelmed simply to be in their presence (""You're all much bigger than your action figures.  Except for you, Master Mantis"").  The dialogue is well written and very funny and entertaining.

Where this movie shines is in the visuals.  For some inexplicable reason, Dreamworks just pulled out ALL the stops on the animation work and this movie is simply gorgeous.  The colors are beautiful, the mountain scenery is stunning, the stars at night, the fog, sunrise, etc etc...

The animation peaks in the rendering of Tai Lung, the sort-of villain.  Tai Lung is depicted as an utterly magnificent snow leopard, and when he's on-screen in all his massive glory he simply OWNS the movie.  His escape from the inescapable prison is by far the most exciting action scene in the movie, too bad it comes near the beginning.  I can't help but wish they'd build an entire movie solely around this magnificent creature (it's hard to even mention him without using the word ""magnificent"").

If you own a 19-inch 4:3 television, you may find this movie entertaining at most.  If you're fortunate to have a full home theater setup with blu-ray you'll be stunned.  The third or fourth time you watch it you may even be tempted to turn the sound down, pop in some head music instead, and just soar with the visuals.  I only wish this movie were a painting so I could hang it on my wall.",1252281600,,2287,4.724747474747475

1167652,5,7880879625,"What do you get when you combine state of the art CGI, some of the best actors in Hollywood, and animals performing kung fu? One of the year's best movies. Kung Fu Panda was widely loved by critics and fans during its theatrical release, and for good reason.

The movie centers around Po the panda, and his journey of self discovery. Po (Jack Black) is the (adopted) son of a noodle maker (played by the legendary James Hong), and his father wants nothing more than for Po to follow in the family footsteps of running the noodle shop. Unfortunately, Po has dreams of more kung fu-y things; his idols aren't chefs and cooks, but the legendary Furious Five.

When he hears that kung fu teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is going to hold trials to find out which of the Furious Five are the Dragon Warrior who is destined to save the village from the evil Tai Lung, Po drops everything, disrespects his father's wishes, and sneaks off to witness the trials. After a series of unfortunate events culminating in a firework powered rocket chair, Po becomes crowned the Dragon Warrior, and begins to learn kung fu in order to fulfill his destiny.

While a fairly clich tale at its core, Kung Fu Panda nevertheless delights for a multitude of reasons. Whether it's the humorous dialog, the masterful voice acting by the stars (including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, David Cross, Lucy Liu, and Seth Rogen), or the ultimate lesson that anyone can achieve anything if they try hard enough, it's impossible not to love the movie. Not since Shrek has a non-Pixar animated film been this magnificent, and not since the Disney films of the early 90s has an animated movie managed to not only entertain children and adults, but also teach important lessons that are valuable to people of all ages, backgrounds, and lifestyles.

Visually and audibly, Kung Fu Panda is far superior on Blu-Ray than DVD, but unlike many modern movies the studio didn't seem to hold back from the traditional DVD release, and the picture looks slightly better than Pixar's Ratatouille and Cars.

To reward DVD purchasers, the DVD comes packed with a special additional 30 minute feature revolving around the Furious Five. In this extra take, Po and Shifu return to the martial arts temple in order to train a group of young rabbits. In over his head, Po resorts to teaching them the five moralities of kung fu by explaining how each of the Furious Five (Crane, Monkey, Viper, Tigress, and Mantis) came to be who they were. Unlike the movie, The Secrets of the Furious Five is created with watercolor inspired Asian art, much like the film's opening credits.

Unfortunately, only David Cross reprises his role from the movie for the Furious Five. (Black and Hoffman both return as Po and Shifu, though.) The other four are noticeably absent, although Monkey's is handled quite brilliantly with Jaycee Chan (Jackie Chan's son) playing him. Who better to play a young version of Jackie Chan's character than Jackie's own son? It's disappointing to not get his voice back for more, but it's a smart decision that I felt paid off.

Outside of the extra separate disc feature, the features packed on the Kung Fu Panda disc itself are entertaining enough, but nothing stands out as extraordinary. The thirteen minute ""Meet the Cast"" feature is the most worthwhile of the bunch, as it shows a lot of the stars on the set and gets their take on what it's like to record voices in such an unusual picture. (Fun fact: I didn't notice Seth Rogen was Mantis until I watched this after the movie. Dude's in EVERYTHING these days!)

Despite the lack of meaningful extras other than the Secrets of the Furious Five and Meet the Cast, Kung Fu Panda is still a must-own on whatever format you're capable of playing. If you own a blu-ray player, buy it on BR. If you own a DVD player, buy it on DVD. It's a family movie that truly is fun for the whole family - even if your family has no one under the age of 20. Buy it, watch it, love it, and be reminded of the time when people other than Pixar made classic animated films.",1249689600,,4066,4.645340751043116

1167654,1,7880879625,"A horrible storyline can spoil even the best of films.
American film-makers have this neverending love for stereotyped underdog stories with the brave character who finds his true self and achieves success despite most unpromising circumstances. I suppose it is a manifestation of a stereotyped image of the American dream, this feeding the average viewer with the idea that anyone can have a dream an make a success out of it.
This underdog storyline can be sometimes exploited with originality and effectiveness (take Hercules and Mulan, to remain to cartoons) but it can also be a tricky path to choose as it is fully demonstrated here.

That animation is excellent (and yet computer tricks are a little TOO evident and mechanical looking) and rhythm serrated, that voice-acting is professional and funny turns out not to be enough.

1167687,1,7880879625,"The cgi film genre has really gone above and beyond anything we have come to expect. Since the release of the classic Toy Story in 1995, the computer animated film has been taken up by all the major studios and even introduces digital 3-D technology. Still, with this breakthrough art film taboo at this point I feel that now business is taking over and it's up to the cooporate people to just get the movie to the big screen so people can spend their money just because it looks cool.

That brings me to Kung Fu Panda. Now, I unfortunatly missed this movie in its theatrical release, but I had heard good things about the film and that it was even up for the Oscar. I saw it and wondered what the academy was smoking and why they weren't willing to share. Did I seriously miss something with this movie? First of all the movie was not funny. I don't about the movie going masses, but Jack Black needed to try and learn how to diversify is acting. I really thought that after his role in King Kong he would have gone on to do some great work. Instead we him doing the exact same thing in every movie he makes. My other problem was the cast. You would have guessed that Jackie Chan was in this movie? Maybe if they would have given him or any of the other supporting members of the Furious Five more than 2 lines you would have?

Personally I don't even want to keep talking about this disgrace of a film. Besides the maginificent work on putting together the fight scenes this movie was pretty horrible. I once thought that Disney had finally gotten knocked off the pedistil as the number one maker of animated films. Nowadays I realize I may be wrong. You have to see who wants to bring a good film to the masses and who just wants to make the big bucks. It really is a numbers game when it comes down to it.

Besides that, when I see these computer animated film titles Im somewhat hesitant sometimes, after seeing meet the robinsons.
This film, I thought AT FIRST, was to be dumb based on the title and general 'idea' of the plot. *flames welcomed*
My nephew called me when he found it on HBO and asked me to watch it with him. I sat down and watched the movie.
I was very pleased with it. In fact, I thought it was very creative and I enjoyed it.
I am planning to buy the dvd and those who hate it, can give the dvd to me. So I like this movie and its one for me to keep. ^_^",1243296000,,667,3.9044117647058822

Animation graphics is so awesome with very real action moves. Don't know if Jackie Chan shares his ideas and action direction, but it's as is from his movie signatures. Very good moves, most of them are real fighting moves.

1167692,5,7880879625,One of the best new family movies to come out in the last few years.,1242259200,,68,3.6
1167693,3,7880879625,"As voiced by funnyman Jack Black, Po is just your average Chinese panda with dreams of one day becoming a world-class kung fu fighter (isn`t that what all pandas living in China aspire to be?).  When he's chosen by The Master to become the new Dragon Warrior, a position that brings virtually unlimited power to the individual who holds it, Po is thrown into round-the-clock training sessions to help groom him for the role - kind of like Eliza Doolittle on steroids.

The plot of ""Kung Fu Panda"" - with its echoes of ""The Karate Kid"" and even of ""Star Wars"" in its portrayal of teacher/pupil relationships - is fairly derivative in nature and lacks the kind of  strong secondary characters we`ve come to expect from computer-animated  films (no slam intended on the voiceover work by Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan).

Still, there is sufficient energy, wit and visual inventiveness in the movie to captivate the little ones while keeping the rest of us from actively storming the box office and demanding our money back.  This is most definitely not one of the ""great ones,"" as animated features go, but it is short and pleasant enough to at least earn it a spot in the recommended column.",1242086400,,1241,4.748837209302326
1167694,5,7880879625,"Funny, great movie, you can watch it many times and you will enjoy it everytime. Everyone in the family enjoy it. It is great movie from the content to the music. Wonderful!",1242000000,,173,4.4375
1167695,4,7880879625,"""Kung Fu Panda"" is one of the more pleasant surprises to come out of the Hollywood animated film machine these days.  While the Pixar movies are virtual locks for greatness, the rest of the genre has become rather tired, with big name stars lining up for movies designed for max box office appeal rather than great storytelling.

So the non-Pixar test these days is, are we watching something more akin to ""Shrek,"" or closer to ""Shrek the Third""?

""KFP"" is, thank goodness, right up there with ""Shrek"" in the pantheon of enjoyable animated films not produced by Pixar.  Jack Black is the perfect choice to play Po, the panda seemingly consigned by fate and fat to sell noodles the rest of his life.  But Po's destiny is to be something else- the Dragon Warrior, who shall bring peace to all.

Black's comedic timing is on display as he gets virtually all the great lines in this movie, although Dustin Hoffman does yeoman's work as his kung fu mentor, Master Shifu.  This movie essentially wastes other big names who were cast for no apparent reason, as they lend very little to the story:  Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Jackie Chan lend their voices to the Furious Five (a collection of kung fu warriors), but none of these fine actors does anything significant.  Ian MacShane plays the villain as only he can, but in large part this is Black's and Hoffman's show.

Very family friendly, with more than a few ""fat jokes"" thrown in (but these are more funny than caustic).  Excellent animation and solid storytelling throughout - this is a very good family film.",1241913600,,1586,4.689530685920578

It was amusing and the animation is good, but it is much too violent for children younger than preteen. The reviews stated that it was great family entertainment for ages 3 and up. I have a son who will shortly be turning 4 and found it unsuitable viewing for him. We were watching it as a family and found ourselves (my husband and I) horrified that we had exposed our son to such violence. I feel that the movie was misrepresented - all the previews depict is as being light and funny, and the reviews on amazon, as I stated before, suggested it was suitable for ages 3 and up.  I am no prude but this film is clearly not appropriate for anyone that young.  The violence was extreme and vicious, even by adult standards.  It should have been advertised as such.",1237334400,3,876,4.3496932515337425
1167725,5,7880879625,My 8 and 5 year old love this movie. I haven't seen it yet though. Got it for under $10 - great price for a great movie.,1236988800,,120,3.4814814814814814
1167756,5,7880879625,Great all around animation with Jack Black and Jackie Chan! I loved the idea that what can appear as a weakness can actually be a strength.  Good for all audiences! Must See!,1236729600,,174,4.4375
1167757,5,7880879625,"More than a remake, this DreamWorks animated movie is an evident ripoff of the late Chris Farley's 1997 comedy; the more so because no one admits it is!. Pillage includes the movie's premise (Big Fat Klutz rises from Class Embarrassment to to Top Martial Arts Master), several key scenes, the theme song (you guessed it -""Kung Fu Fighting""), and entire lines, starting with Farley's classic ""That's AWWWWESOME!!!"", looted as the panda's mantra.

Having said that, Kung Fu Panda is by far a much better film. In fact, it's a great film; the kind of film I wish I'd seen when I was a boy. Back then, us chubby kids were not the rule but the exception, and it seemed our only reason in life was to bear with a grin countless fat jokes and ridicule from peers and teachers (if you think Kubrick dreamt up all the abuse you hear in Full Metal Jacket, you weren't born before 1980). A fat kid was not only considered glutton but stupid, since you couldn't do whatever it was the other kids did. You either found yourself something to be good at, or you cried yourself to sleep. Fortunately for me, I found drawing, and upon it I developed my professional success. Unfortunately for me, I also developed diabetes.

Today, obese kids are not the class fatsos but a global pandemia. Kung Fu Panda shows these kids they may not be the ideal, but they're certainly no damaged goods; in fact, they can excel to whatever their will takes them if they learn discipline, sacrifice, compassion, patience, toil and respect. Not a bad message to get across, specially when most ""cool""movies only promote sex, guns and foul language.

Plus, the movie itself is a marvel to look at. Not only its animation, which is superb, but the artistic concept behind it, for one not only sees funny characters kicking butt, one sees them as part of entire Chinese watercolors come to life in a universe where every background has a life of its own, and no detail is overlooked. I haven't seen an animated film of such graphic beauty since 101 Dalmatians, nearly fifty years ago.",1236729600,,2047,4.633608815426998
1167758,4,7880879625,"This was a nice movie with likable characters but, frankly, I didn't find it anything memorable. Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that.

I guess my expectations were sky high, which made it almost impossible to meet. The story could have used more laughs, too. I think that was the main thing that slightly disappointed me: the humor was mild, not laugh-out-loud funny.

Having said all that, it was enjoyable and it will put numerous smiles on your face as you watch it. I guess ""pleasant,"" ""agreeable,"" ""warm,"" etc., would be better words to describe the film. It is pretty, too, especially on Blu-Ray. I imagine this looked awesome on IMAX in the theater.

Jack Black does a nice job of voicing the main character, ""Po,"" the panda that surprised everyone, including himself, on what he could achieve if he set his mind to it. That's another plus for the film: nice messages.

Kids should like this more than adults but grownups will enjoy it, too.",1236211200,,1053,4.614973262032086

1167762,5,7880879625,"There are plenty of reviews here about the movie itself, so I'll just limit my comments to the quality of this movie in Blu-Ray. To date this is the most astonishing Blu-Ray movie I've seen. The detail is astounding, you can see each blade of grass and tree leaf in full hi-def glory and they are actually moving in the wind! Every texture on every surface was lovingly modeled by the animation team and show up in crisp, clear detail on our 52"" Bravia. The closer you get to the TV the more detail you see, it's really quite amazing. I watched it at home the first time with my older daughter and the entire movie we were saying things like ""look at the texture on his clothes!"" ""Look at the moss growing on the rocks!"" We barely noticed the dialog because we were so floored by the incredible visuals! We typically rent movies, but this particular one was a must-own just to show visitors to our home what Blu-Ray and hi-def TVs are all about.

Po (Jack Black) is a giant panda who dreams of being the most ""awesomely awesome"" Kung-Fu master that ever walked the planet. Too bad for him he works in his father's (who happens to be a goose-classic) noodle shop. His heroes are the Furious Five: Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie). Their leader is Master Shifu (which is ""master"" in Chinese, so they're saying ""master master"" during the whole film, more laughter) and his master is Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). The enemy of this motley crew is the leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), Shifu's adopted protg.

In a twist of fate at the ceremony to name the Chosen One, Po literally falls into that role. Uncoordinated, forever hungry, and completely clueless to the intricacies of Kung-Fu, he manages to fit in with the gang except for Tigress and Shifu (a fall-out of my seat moment happened when Mantis was giving Po acupuncture and tweaked a facial nerve).

The ultimate showdown between Po and Tai Lung is fantastic. The action sequences (with ""Matrix"" slowdowns and stop-motion) were breathtaking (along with the accompanying backdrops). This is a great film, destined to join the hierarchy of great animated classics of the past. 4.5 stars!",1234569600,,1515,5.027888446215139

1167881,4,7880879625,"So who would win in a fight? Kung Fu Panda (Po) or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B001EOQWFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>? Which movie is better? Let's break it down in pro boxing's real world 8-point-must system.

The fight for the better movie (6 Rounds):

Wall-E story: 10
Kung Fu Panda story: 9

Wall-E voice acting talent: 8
Kung Fu Panda voice acting talent: 10

Wall-E action: 9
Kung Fu Panda action: 10

Wall-E family fun factor: 9
Kung Fu Panda family fun factor: 10

Wall-E ""I wanna see it again"" factor: 9
Kung Fu Panda ""I wanna see it again"" factor: 10

Wall-E DVD extras: 9
Kung Fu Panda DVD extras: 10

Unanimous decision: Wall-E 54  Kung Fu Panda 59
Better Movie: Kung Fu Panda

Now if Wall-E and Po had to fight for the title, it would probably go something like this:

Po comes right out swinging and kicking. Wall-E immediately looks broken. Po belly-slams Wall-E and one of Wall-E's eye-lenses pops loose. Po closes in on Wall-E for the Wuxi Finger Hold, but before Po can say ""skadoosh"", Wall-E activates his welding laser and makes Panda steaks out of Po.

Winner by KO: Wall-E

Both movies are worth your time. Check 'em out.",1231891200,2,1210,5.0201005025125625

1167901,3,7880879625,"When I started this movie, I expected a simple children's film with cardboard characters and half-rate animation. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised on most counts.

I don't know why people ranked this film's animation below Pixar's. Character designs are well done and colors are on the mark. Just the first section of Kung Fu Panda has a wonderfully stylized dream sequence full of delightful color, movement, and humor. Fight sequences are exciting and entertaining -- bizarre, really, when you realize you're looking at a bunch of anthropomorphic animals doing impossible things (impossible things that look strangely possible!). Emotion is effortlessly imparted on each character's face -- even through such small things as their eyes and simple shifts in their postures. There are many frames in this movie that could be turned into a picture on the wall (Oogway's ascension, the Tigress leaping past the moon). Face it -- you can't give Pixar all the credit in the animation biz.

The humor is varied between jokes at Po's expense to slapstick. It's juvenile humor, to be sure; the kiddos will adore it, but it's unconventional enough to pull a chuckle or two out of adults. Po training with dumplings was nothing short of a laugh a minute.

The characters themselves are actually a bit more complex than what I expected. Po is a sweet, good-natured protagonist who I really rooted for; Jack Black does an excellent job as his voice actor. The Master Shi-Fu (voiced by Hoffman) has a surprising past that left a tear in my eye, as does villain Tai Lun. The Furious Five are the only rather ""flat"" characters, only because they have less screen time.

The downside is the very formulaic story, which rushes forward at the speed of a bullet train, and its simple, fortune-cookie Chinese philosophy. There's nothing wrong with it, per se; but it's just not that striking and it's nothing you haven't heard before. It's ultimately what makes this film forgettable afterward.

This film is a fast-paced, enjoyable diversion that should be fun for kids and adults alike. Just don't expect to come back to it over and over unless you're below the age of 10.",1231632000,2,2158,4.933884297520661

1167951,5,7880879625,"This movie, my 3 year old son just watched over, and over, and over again. Even my parents loved this movie! Reconmended for parents with kids who loves martial arts!",1231632000,,166,4.566666666666666
1167952,3,7880879625,"This is a visually striking animated film. It is beautifully colored, beautifully drawn, and has an appealing enough schnook of a hero.

However we hardly get to know many of the key characters, such as the members of the ""Furious Five."" Most of them are given only a few lines to establish their personalities. The similarity between two of the opposing characters might also create some confusion among young viewers. There's Tigress, one of the heroic Furious Five. Then there's Tai Lung, also a fierce-looking feline - who is the arch villain impressively voiced by Ian McShane. A youngster (or an adult) could initially confuse the two.

Then where we might expect some family resemblance, there is none. The Panda's father is inexplicably - a goose. In the Director's Commentary, John Stevenson says that this anomaly is gleefully accepted by children. Well, maybe...

However, the script seems to me to be too random in too many places. Elements needed to further the plot or to bring resolution are often plucked out of the air. I expected the heroes' fighting techniques to ultimately relate somehow to their unique backgrounds and skills. For example, I kept expecting the Panda to execute some winning maneuver culled from his background balancing hot dishes of noodles, serving noodles every day in his father's noodle shop. But that never happens. Whatever fighting techniques the Panda or any of the others employ are strictly ad hoc. They don't relate to anything the characters bring to the combat or to anything they might have learned in their kung fu training with the Master.

This is in contrast with the scripting of another recent acclaimed action animation film, ""The Incredibles."" In fighting their adversaries, the ploys used by the Incredibles arise organically from who they are, from powers that were initially established for them and that they honed or remembered in the course of the action.

So younger children might be happy with the general look and appeal of ""Kung Fu Panda."" But for somewhat older children who demand a more coherent storyline, more consistent characterization, and some imparted wisdoms that they can actually apply in winning their battles in life, I suggest a film such as ""The Incredibles.""",1231632000,2,2249,5.0675675675675675

The Blu-Ray visuals are simply amazing and the story conveys simple lessons that kids can understand, although they'll probably forget it the next day anyway (*sigh*, kids). The only disappointment was the lack of special features. Those are all for kids to watch, so there are videos that show you how to use a chopstick and  the cultural reasons why these particular animals were chosen.",1231545600,,537,4.712765957446808

Panda/Black has to excel in the art of kung-fu in order to save the ""world"" (see the resemblance to Star Wars and Luke having to learn the ways of the Force to defeat Darth Wader).

OK, back to reality.. the storyline is great fun with multiple elements, making it worthwhile for the adult audience, but also easy enough for even toddlers to enjoy. (On a side note: I do find it amusing, how many cartoons try and inject us with a bit of morality, although here it doesn't ruin the movie.)

The graphics is at an amazing level of quality, as is the sound scheme.

1168127,4,7880879625,"okay, so when the wife and I finally saw Kung Fu Panda, i had no expectation for it to be as good as the average Pixar joint, but they did a GREAT job on this one! this movie had great design and a well-constructed, family-friendly story of a slacker/dreamer who has to learn to believe in himself and reach his full potential.

I'm not all that impressed with the scattered pop-culture humor Dreamworks usually resorts to in their 3d films, but the humour in Kung Fu Panda is tightly packed and focused in the film, with fanboy references that true Kung Fu heads will catch without being a distraction to the chi-impaired.

the movie had all-around splendid design, from the character designs (you'll love Angelina Jolie's character, Master Tigress and the elderly turtle sensei Master Oogway)to the soundtrack. the environments were especially well-conceived, and thankfully, so were the fight scenes! the fight scene choreographer was actually trained in Kung Fu, and all the animators got Kung Fu lessons to prepare for the film! and it shows, as the fight scenes are among the best i've ever seen in an american cartoon!

the opening sequence and end titles employed 2d animation and were so fabulous it made me wanna see DreamWorks do more 2d joints too! Anyways, please go watch this movie... we need to see more films executed on this level. one of the best films of 2008... COP IT!
holla!

While I enjoyed it, I think it's far too predictable and not as in-depth as other works by Dreamworks or Pixar. The plot is very simple and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise and kids will really get a kick out of the humour. I found myself laughing once or twice.

The voice cast is really great especially Dustin Hoffman and Jack Black. Again, the animation is brilliant and certainly some of the finest I've seen in a long while. All in all, a simple but fun movie that the whole family will enjoy.",1231113600,2,618,4.373913043478261
1168132,4,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda is right up there with THE INCREDIBLES and WALL-E for my favorite animated film ever. Not just a hilarious send up of martial arts flicks, nor another opportunity for Jack Black to assert his comic genius, Kung Fu Panda is an awesome piece of story telling that will appeal to adults just as much as its target audience.

The animation is beautiful. I've always preferred 3D animation to hand drawn, and this movie is a good example of why. There is no clipping or jaggedness to the animation; each scene is smooth and looks incredible.

The story is classic martial arts fare, with a few twists. Po the Panda, against all odds, is chosen to be the fabled Dragon Warrior, despite the fact that he knows nothing about martial arts except what he has read in pulp serials. He is out of shape and untrained, and his only real asset is his unshakable hopefulness and charm. Without getting into too much of a plot summary, the story is good-enough. The real reason to watch this one isn't the plot anyway. The visuals, the humor, and the voice acting are all perfect, and make even an average plot shine.

As Po the panda says, there is ""no charge for awesomness,"" except maybe the cost of the DVD or Blue Ray.

4.5/5 stars. An instant classic animated film. Buy yourself a copy and another one for someone you love.",1231027200,,1326,4.5125

1168154,5,7880879625,"(disclaimer: if you are considering the Blu-Ray disc, you should know that it does not contain the ""Secrets of the Furious Five"" extra feature that is available with some DVD versions of this movie)
I loved this film in the theater, and I decided to buy the Blu-ray version simply for its color and detail.  At 1080p, the picture is ornate, vivid, and eye-popping.
I've also been very pleased with the sound quality of this disc.  I'm no golden-ear, but I can tell you that my Onkyo TX-SR806 receiver offered me a sizeable variety of options as far as the audio: I believe some of the lossless audio options my receiver picked up on are unique to the Blu-Ray version.  The end result of all this technology is that the movie both looks and sounds amazing--more amazing, in my opinion, than it was in our local theater.
Kung-Fu Panda is a hilarious, enjoyable family film that does an excellent job of capturing the excitement of martial arts while downplaying the violence of what is ultimately a battle story.  The beauty of this film is that while it borrows from many movie cliches, it also embeds a rather good message about not trying to be who you think people expect you to be--but simply making the best of who you are. There's an undercurrent of believing in yourself that warms the heart as much as the gentle humor that plays throughout.  Voiced by Jack Black (as Po the Panda), Dustin Hoffman (as his trainer Master Sifu) and a celebrity supporting cast, the chemistry comes together and makes Kung-Fu Panda a fun film that stands up to repeat viewings.  Highly recommended.",1230681600,,1586,4.666666666666667

1168156,4,7880879625,"Beautifully animated and rich with meaning, `Kung Fu Panda' is a surefire crowd pleaser and, well, a whole lot of fun.  Pairing crisp imagery with some sublime voice over actors, `Kung Fu Panda' is as entertaining as the trailers would suggest and definitely deserves a spot as one of the best animated films of the year.

The film tells the story of Po, a Panda who dreams of one day achieving Kung Fu awesomeness.  The only problem is that he comes from a long line of noodle makers and his father just doesn't understand his desire to fight.  When word comes that the evil kung fu master Tai Lung may escape imprisonment it is time to name the Dragon Warrior, a kung fu master who will receive the dragon scroll and all its endless power.  The ceremony is held and it is believed that one of the furious five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane and Viper) will be named the Dragon Warrior, but not all is as it seems and Po is named the warrior.  Kung Fu master Shifu must train Po in order for him to defeat Tai Lung.

The storyline is simple enough for children to grasp yet not too dulled down to the point where parents are bored stiff.  The action keeps coming and the hilarity rarely lets up, and the message about believing in oneself is very strong and very enlightening, especially for children.

I will give a word of caution, and beings that this is a film targeted towards the young ones I feel that this `warning' is valid and justified.  The film is filled with kung fu violence.  Now yes, I understand that a lot of cartoons have violence within them, and I normally am not one to balk at all, but there is a slight difference (is it really slight?) between stylized comical violence and intentional dark violence.  Tai Lung is an evil soul and the fight scenes between him and the furious five or him and Shifu are quite violent and not comical (his fight with Po is rather funny).  His escape from the prison is rather violent as well.  The point being that, while a film like `The Incredibles' is violent, it is a comical kind of violence (the villain in that film is funny in itself) but the violence here is darker and may not be something you want your children imitating.  Just a word of caution to parents, since being a parent I appreciate those words myself.

Anyways, I really like this movie, and I think that most parents and children will too.  Just know your kids first, that's all I say.  It's entertaining and action packed and funny to boot.  Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman make a great team here.",1230595200,6,2528,4.44468546637744

1168158,5,7880879625,"I really felt like I'd gotten out of something earlier this year when my husband offered to take kids to see this movie in the theater. Even after they said it was good, I still didn't quite believe them. (I've sat through enough cyncial/crummy Dreamworks movies--for example, Over the Hedge, Bee Movie, Magadascar, Shark Tales, and Shrek 3--to cause me to lose faith in the brand.) But Santa brought Kung Fu Panda on DVD and we watched it together yesterday. It was actually quite good--stunning animation, and a good story with a valuable message. In fact, one of the main themes of the film echoed something Nancy Pelsoi said in her recent book about women's leadership, ""Know Your Power: A Message to America's Daughters."" How's that for an unexpected connection?

I spend lots of time with nine- and ten-year-olds, and I really appreciate things that are truly aimed at them. Not too babyish, but not just wholesale appropriation of teen culture, either (as in, ""Mom, when can I have a cell phone?""). Kung Fu Panda hit that sweet spot for me.

Jack Black as the Panda was excellant. Hoffman as the master was very good. The animation was good enough. The starting dream sequence imitated the ""Samurai Jack"" style of animation and was hilarious. The humor drove the movie. I'm not a philosopher, but the lessons of the movie were basically the westernized, simplified Zen teachings you get now days. It is basically the same lesson as the ""The Last Dragon,"" but this movie is far better. The fight scenes using animals were creative. The villian was evil and scary.

1168213,5,7880879625,"Having written quite a few reviews on Amazon over the years, I've gotten rather strict with what products I give five stars.  One recent exception to my new, stricter rule is Dreamworks' ""Kung Fu Panda.""  My wife took our daughter to see this at the movies while I stayed at home with our youngest child.  I must admit that I envied my wife when she walked out of the house to see the film, for it had peaked my interest with its commercials and trailers.  When it arrived on DVD, my wife picked it up for the whole family.  She stated that she really enjoyed the film.  This was a good sign for me since my wife isn't into many animated films.

From the wonderful opening ""dream sequence"" to the climactic battle with Tai Lung, ""Kung Fu Panda"" doesn't disappoint at all.  It's the story of Po (Jack Black), an overweight, clumsy panda who longs to become a great kung fu master like the legendary Furious Five.  Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has guided the Furious Five for many years and has literally raised them to be great fighting machines.  Only one student fell to the wayside under Shifu, and that was the wicked (and imprisoned) Tai Lung (Ian McShane).  Tai Lung thinks he deserves to be the dragon warrior and therefore the only person wise and powerful enough to learn the secrets of the dragon scroll.

When Po is named as the dragon warrior (much to the surprise of Shifu and the Furious Five), Tai Lung escapes his prison in order to claim what he feels is rightfully his.  Shifu and the Five must prepare Po for the greatest battle of his life.  Can they do it?  You'll have to watch this hilarious family flick to find out.

Black is great as Po.  He fits into the clumsy, plus-sized role perfectly.  The Furious Five consists of the voice talents of Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), Seth Rogen (Mantis), David Cross (Crane) and Angelina Jolie (Tigress).  Each of the group is given a nice amount of screen time and they make wonderful straight men to the goofy Po.  McShane and Hoffman are also excellent in their roles.  Listen for more highly recognizable voices in smaller roles in the film as well.

What makes ""Kung Fu Panda"" worthy of five stars is the fact that it manages to be a family friendly film with great comedy, brilliant animation and heart-stopping action sequences.  Honestly, some of the best fight sequences I've ever witnessed are in this film.  My particular favorite is a showdown between the Five and Tai Lung.  There's also the solid lesson of believing in oneself in order to achieve your dreams, no matter how far-fetched they might be.

I highly recommend ""Kung Fu Panda"" to anyone who enjoys a great family film, comedy or action flick.  It covers all of those bases and is well worth multiple viewings.  Once again, I highly recommend this film and suggest you purchase a copy for yourself.",1229385600,3,2846,4.593253968253968

1168260,4,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda (Mark Osborne and John Stevenson, 2008)

I've put off writing my Kung Fu Panda review for so long that the DVD is now out. Oops. I did originally see it in the theaters, and I liked it a great deal more than I thought I was going to, given the voice talent in it, but I never quite liked it as much as everyone else seemed to. And thus I've been trying to write this review on and off since I was wishing for the kinds of temperatures we have now. (Stupid me, I never learn. I'm pining for ninety-degree days again.)

Osborne (until now best known for his Weird Al Yankovic video ""Jurassic Park"") and Stevenson (responsible for the fine, and all too short-lived, TV show Father of the Pride) give us the tale of Po (Jack Black), a somewhat lazy panda whose sole desire is to be a martial artist like his heroes, the Furious Five. Instead, however, he spends his time working at the noodle house owned by his adoptive father, Mr. Ping (James Hong). When the Furious Five's temple has an open house, the whole town turns out, and Mr. Ping sends Po to sell noodles at the gathering. Through a series of misadventures, Po finds himself tasked with becoming a Kung Fu master. Meanwhile, the evil warlord Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped from captivity--can Po be the one to stop him?

It's a fun movie, entertaining for both kids and adults alike. The main reason it surprises me that I think so is because so much of the voice talent is provided by people who either can't act (Black. Angelina Jolie and Seth Rogen voicing two of the Furious Five) or who aren't actors at all (Osborne and Stevenson both chime in, as well as production supervisor Jeremy Shipp, producer Melissa Cobb, and a handful of others who usually work behind the scenes). And yet it all came out very well. Is it, as I've seen it called, the best animated feature since the Lion King? No, I don't think so--all of the movies Pixar made during its reign as the best studio on the planet have fallen in between these--but it's certainly worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet. The humor is decidedly adult (in that it's not ""playing down"" to the tween/teen set with potty humor and jokes that will make parents groan), the story is inspiring, and the animation is exceptionally well-done. It may not go down in history as one of the best movies ever, but it's well worth a rental now that the DVD is out, and if you get a chance to catch it on the big screen and you never did, it's worth a look. *** ",1228521600,,2486,4.362850971922247

The movie is BEAUTIFUL, i mean the picture, the detail, the scenes and the backgrounds... amazing.  Takes you into another world.  The music score is amazing too!",1228521600,,207,5.029411764705882
1168290,1,7880879625,"We rented this to watch as a family, after hearing so much ""buzz"" about it.  The animation is amazing in parts, there are a few funny moments, and a couple of lines with half-decent, shallow messages.
Overall, however, we were very disappointed in the film.
First, the film is extremely violent.  While the action attempts to be slap-sticky in parts, it is nothing like the old Road Runner and Wiley Coyote scenes.  The fighting is VERY intense (as well as the accompanying audio), and the characters are outright vicious.  The ""bad-guy"" character will give small children nightmares.  You watch the characters ruthlessly kill each other over and over again (or, at least they would die from such violent acts if only they weren't animated characters).  On a scale from road runner to Terminator, the action leans far toward the latter.  I can't imagine a responsible parent using this film to babysit a young child.
Frankly, we didn't really like the message of the movie either.  It attempts to convey the message of ""just believe in yourself and you'll fulfill your destiny.""  That's fine and dandy, but the panda is depicted as being dishonest, lazy, unintelligent, goofy, and given to bad habits (binge-eating).  His eating disorder is used by his trainer as motivation for some brief martial arts training, and voila, he beats the great enemy of the people in all-out mortal combat.  I would rather have seen a message of integrity, hard work, sacrifice, and courage.  IF the message of this film were true, I could vegitate in front of a wii and eat chips all day and turn into a Ghandi or General Washington with almost no effort on my part.
There are plenty of exciting, adventurous, meaningful and truly inspiring films out there.  Keep looking, because this film is just another course of the usual fare of empty calories, and leaves much to be desired.",1228435200,31,1864,4.842271293375394

When I first heard about Kung Fu Panda, it was being hailed as one of the best movies of the year. I finally got a chance to see it, and it somewhat delivers on these claims.

The movie teaches some great lessons in Dreamworks's creative manner, such as working hard to pursue a dream and never giving up. Another plus was that the movie was almost completely clean of allusions to lewd or immoral behavior, as you are bound to find even in many ""children's"" films nowadays.

The only downside was that the storyline was quite predictable from about halfway through the film. That's why I gave the film only 4 stars.
However, that's coming from me; most kids, such as my 5- and 7-year-old cousins, would almost definitely give this movie five stars.",1227657600,,870,4.493670886075949

1168317,4,7880879625,"Animated films rely heavily on the appeal of the actors voicing the various characters.

And KUNG FU PANDA now resides in close company with them.

Whomever cast Kung Fu Panda deserves some serious recognition. All of the voice characters, without exception, were perfect for their animal type. From Dustin Hoffman's wise Shifu and Angelina Jolies rough Tigress to Jackie Chan (as Monkey), Seth Rogan (as Mantis), Lucy Liu (as Viper) and the unforgettable Jack Black as Po the Kung Fu Panda, every one of them were awesome shining lights of pure ...um ...awesomeness.

The story is standard fodder: a nobody Panda (Jack Black) seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a shlepper of noodle dishes. But Po (the Panda) has always been infatuated with the Kung Fu masters. And when a call comes down from on-high that a new master is being chosen, Po rushes to the tower to find out who it might be (will it be Tigress? Or Viper? Or one of the others?). Surprisingly it turns out to be the rotund and out-of-shape Po.

Training begins and Po is neither liked nor respected by any of the Kung Fu fighters (yes, the song is in there, too, of course). But once Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) learns how to motivate Po, the training begins in earnest.

Problems arise, however, when word spreads that an enemy of the Kung Fu lands has escaped his prison and whomever the new Kung Fu Master might be will have to deal with him.

The antics and battles are funny and epic. Using his blubbery size, Po often bounces his way to success, or eats his way into the audience's heart (particularly funny is when he finds a stash of cookies in a high cabinet and does a perfect split in order to reach them and gobble `em down).

It is a telling story that shows us you don't have to be some foxy 007 type in order to succeed. Using your natural abilities often times allows you all the power you'll need. And Jack Black's sloth-like nature was a perfect fit for Po and those who enjoyed Kung Fu Panda.

This is the first time for Dreamworks not to use pop culture references or modern music (except at the end credits) but focuses on straight storytelling with good timed humor and great animation to go with it.

The extras on the disc are rather weak, but this is more than made up for by the supremely excellent digital transfer to Blu-Ray. CGI movies like Kung Fu Panda are really where the PS3 and Blu-Ray shine. Watching this movie on my 40 inch TV showed up tiny details lost when I saw the film originally at the theater. Absolutely breathtaking and well worth the extra money for the Blu-Ray over DVD if you have an HD TV and a Blu-Ray player. Would have liked a digital copy with it but oh well.

1168399,3,7880879625,"I would have liked a different actor as the mentor to the panda in this movie, but it was still a fair amount of fun and a good message. I was a bit disappointed in Dreamworks casting. Most families will enjoy it. The one voice that truly didn't seem to quite fit was Dustin Hoffman's. No offense to him but we needed someone who could have called Jack Black's panda, grasshopper. David Carradine would have been good in that role. Some may find Hoffman's high pitched complaints funny, it just didn't strike me that way. It is a fairly entertaining movie for the family. Good quality DVD with decent replayablity. If you enjoyed this catch ""Mulan"".

1168400,5,7880879625,"Our story centers around Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black).  He is a Kung Fu legend.  Evildoers fear him and the people adore him.  The Fearsome Five long to fight with him.  And everything...hold on, maybe that isn't the way it really is.

In reality, Po works in his father's noodle restaurant waiting tables.  He's way overweight and out of shape.  But he dreams about Kung Fu and idolizes the Fearsome Five, Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen).  That's why, when it is announced that the legendary Dragon Warrior will soon be chosen, Po leaves everything behind and joins the rest of the village high up the mountain.

Through a series of events, Po winds up being named the Dragon Warrior, much to the dismay of the Fearsome Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) who must train the rookie.  Po doesn't think he can do it, but he doesn't want to quit.  Shifu and the Five want to make him quit.  But they'd better figure things out soon because an old foe is about to return to the village intent on destroying it.  Can Po save the day?

Since I'm not a fan of Jack Black or Dreamworks Animation, I almost skip this flick.  And that would have been a huge mistake.  This is a fun movie for all ages.

So let's get the obvious and the only negative out of the way right now, shall we?  We've seen this plot many, many times before.  But the movie does a great job of making the familiar ride enjoyable.

Part of that is through the humor.  There are lots of great one liners and slap stick scenes.  It's not side splitting funny, but I laughed plenty of times.  And some of the gags were completely unexpected.  Yet the more serious and tender moments don't feel forced in the slightest.  And the story is fast paced with an ending that made me smile.

The first few minutes are hand drawn animation, but the rest of the movie is computer animated.  It looked amazing with plenty of beautiful settings and small details.  They even managed to do a good job with the Kung Fu fight scenes.  Heck, they were easier to follow than fight scenes in many of the live action movies made these days.

I always worry when I hear that a movie has a voice cast made up of famous people, but here they did a good job becoming the characters.  I wasn't left picturing the actor recording the voice.  Instead, I bought the characters and got lost in the story.

Okay, so this movie isn't highly original.  It's still incredibly fun.  And that's all that matters.  I'm glad I gave the movie a chance.",1226361600,,2564,4.438709677419355

The central character rose a bit quickly from zero to hero, but you can't deny the appeal of the detail in the animation and the funny one liners. Loved Mantis-one of my favorite characters! The actors and voices were distinct; the characters seemed to stand on their own, unlike some of the other animated films, where it almost seems like the characters are cartoon versions of the actors. Very cool fight scenes and important message that appeals to parents and kids-strength of character is more important than some ""secret ingredient""-a person directs his/her own course.

This is a series of  fun games you can play with your remote or mouse.  The goal of these games is to complete these tasks to become the dragon warrior.  There is a commentary with the directors of the movie.  There is also an interesting documentary featuring chef Alton Brown. This feature shows a Chinese chef making noodles.  There is even a feature about how to use chopsticks.  This makes me hungry.  My favorite feature though is the Dreamworks Juke Box on this DVD. I love listening and watching the songs and videos from other Dreamworks movies like Shrek 2 and Bee Movie.  Kung Fu Panda is one of the best family movies of the year.

He is then living out his dream of being a kung fu master, but it is rather short lived as he must learn quickly and battle the enemy that threatens to bring destruction into the Valley of Peace.

""Kung Fu Panda"" adds to the growing list of animated kids movies that adults can enjoy.  It's an extraordinarily fun and funny (for all ages) movie to watch.  The story is put together well and will keep you entertained for the film's entirety.  Another big plus is the animation.  It looks so crisp and vivid.

Everything changes one day when Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) has a premonition about Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former protg of his who's gone bad.

He is supposed to pick from among the Furious Five, but error leads to his picking Po. It is left up to Shifu, kung fu master, to teach Po what he needs to defeat Tai Lung but will he be able to in time? That's pretty much what this movie is all about.

In my honest opinion, Kung Fu Panda is awesome. It's even more entertaining than any recent CGI movie I've seen on DVD recently. Given, the movie is played a little more seriously with laces of humor throughout, it is definitely a movie the whole family will enjoy.

Special Features include: Directors' Commentary, ""Meet the Cast"" (13:00)- The cast recording the audio for the film,  ""Pushing the Boundaries"" (7:00) - The computer animation and the creation of the characters,  ""Sound Design"" (4:00) - The creation of the sound for the film,  Music Video of Cee-Lo singing ""Kung Fu Fighting"",  ""Mr. Ping's Noodle House"" (4:00) - The Food Network's Alton Brown goes to Mr. Chow's in L.A. to see how they make noodles,  ""How to Use Chopsticks"" (3:00) - Instructional video,  ""Conservation International: Help Save Wild Pandas"" (3:00) - Jack Black talking about the importance of saving pandas, ""Dragon Warrior Training Academy"" - Game played with the remote.

I liked the trailers and knew that it would look great so I snagged it up and gave it a whirl.  It met and then exceeded my expectations.  They did a wonderful job with everything about this movie.  I've been a long time animation fan and have appreciated what Dreamworks has done with their animated movies, CGI and the handrawn stuff before that.  They have all seemed a little more pop culture like and, while fun to watch once, not really much for repeat viewing.  I can watch Pixar movies over and over again, but never went back to Shrek, Madagascar, Shark Tale or any other Dreamworks movie more than once or twice.
Kung Fu Panda is a new level for them though.  It has a good story, comedy, heart, action and style.  I love the look of this movie.  The fight scenes made me feel the same way I do watching live action Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies.  I really got into them.  The character design is stylish without being distracting, but I would have liked to know more about The Furious Five.  I was upset that the DVD came with a 20 minute DVD about them, but it was not included on the Blu-Ray.
Bottom line, Dreamworks got it right with this movie and it is worth a buy.  It is a world that I would like to re-visit again.

The DVD version comes in a double pack, including the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' ""sequel"" to the original movie. That's a huge draw of buying this movie.

However, the Blu-ray version not only does not have the double-pack offer, it also does not have the movie bundled onto the single blu-ray disc at all, which means if you buy this version you miss out on the new movie.

Why on earth would anyone buy the Blu-ray version if they're missing out on the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' sequel? It seems foolish.

1168465,5,7880879625,"I enter this movie with one question: Was Jack Black born to play the voice of Po, or was he merely groomed to play it? I wouldn't be surprised if the whole movie were centered with him in mind. `Kung Fu Panda' is another Dreamworks' production, one that employs or improves admirable animation tricks--giving the film the vitality of a free-flowing digital puppet show. A visual delight, the film has the innovation of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Surf-s-Up-Full-Screen-Special-Edition/dp/B000UFIYP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Surf's Up (Full Screen Special Edition)</a>' combined with the entertainment value of `Ratatouille'. Sent mostly on the fast track, the film has a good ol' witty time matched with artful adventure.

Literally and figuratively, Po (Black) dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master. He's a chubby Panda bear who has more passion for eating than making the food at his family's noodle restaurant. As he's humoring his stork father, a crisis develops in the village: A prophecy states Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a dragon more aptly described as a snow leopard with pouncing Kung Fu proficiency will escape Chorgum Prison. The town converges on Jade Square, the center of The Valley of Peace where holy wise tortoise, Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), will announce the chosen Dragon Warrior. Clumsily, Po propels himself in the center where Oogway, pointing at Tigress has his finger on the panda instead.

All the voices are right on. Jack Black as already mentioned makes all the ""That's cool,"" aphorisms work through his own hapless character. Happily his lines lack the hyperactivity of Po's training or Black's own character past. (""I know you're being all mystical and Kung Fu-ooey,"" he chortles.) Hardly discernible is Dustin Hoffman, perfectly cast as the quiet curmudgeon master trainer, Shifu (Chief-u). Some of the funniest scenes go along with Po's training. ""There is now a level zero!"" he proclaims after Po's first session. There's also an acupuncture scene that makes a point of Po's ridiculous novice status. Flanking him are the furious five, including a viper (Lucy Liu), a preying mantis (Seth Rogen), a monkey (Jackie Chan), a crane (David Cross) and a tigress (Angelina Jolie), each bringing a certain perfection to their parts. They're all Shifu's prodigies, and each sport some superhero Kung Fu moves as well as resentful remarks for their new dragon slayer trainee.

Adding fortune cookie wisdom to the mix both illuminates and entertains. (""One takes one's destiny on the road to avoid it."" and ""There's no such thing as an accident."" Now I may be all wrong, but I thought Freud said that one.) Everyone from director Jack Stevenson to editor Clare Knight deserve kudos for assembling such a fine feature.

1168467,3,7880879625,"KUNG FU PANDA is a perfectly acceptable entry in the ever growing list of CGI animated films. Yet, because the list is not yet long enough to stretch back more than one generation, it is inevitable that the film be compared to TOY STORY I & II, INCREDIBLES, SHREK, ICE AGE, MONSTERS INC, FINDING NEMO, ROBOTS, etc. etc. This may not be entirely fair (it's not like we compare a film like UNFORGIVEN to every western ever made)...but it's true nonetheless. Upon leaving the theatre, my first thoughts were, ""well, it's better than SHARK'S TALE and ROBOTS and ICE AGE II...but isn't up there with RATATOUILLE and SHREK either."" I should be judging it on its own terms. So I'll try to do that.

This is a fairly standard ""sports underdog"" movie in many ways. The hapless Panda, voiced by Jack Black, is clumsy, overweight and hardly built to excel in Kung Fu, a sport / art form which he knows inside-out (as a mega-fan would). Yet, when a serious threat to his town is unleashed, a wise old turtle comes to believe that this Panda may be ""the dragon warrior"" of legend, the ""one"" who can save them all.

Panda thinks this idea is pretty ridiculous, BUT it gives him a chance to hang out with some of his heroes, true Kung-Fu artists such as Tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Cricket, Snake, etc. He relishes being with them, and even blows off most of their insults and mockery.

But his ""master"" (Dustin Hoffman, doing a really nice job here) is compelled to train Panda, even though he thinks it is a waste of time. What do YOU think? Will Panda find new talents in himself that he never suspected he had? Will he earn the respect of his heroes? Will he save the town?

I won't answer these questions here...but suffice it to say that you know the answers to these questions before the movie even starts. This is a film where the journey to the answers is the key.

The journey is amusing enough. The Chinese village is rendered lovingly, hinting at the feeling of watercolor painting, yet staying true to the almost 3D style of the best CGI films. There is no question the movie looks great. Within these settings, the journey unfolds with funny scenes showing the clumsy Panda attempting Kung Fu. Yes, there's even a training montage.

In fact, the plot is so predictable that the film would be thoroughly tedious were it not for the relationship between master and student. Black's Panda is a nice creation...he's funny & smart, and while he feels overmatched physically, he doesn't actually seem to think there's anything wrong with that. He gets down on himself at times...but is remarkably resilient. Essentially, even if his self-confidence is low (he knows he is not likely to be a pure Kung Fu genius) his self-ESTEEM is always high. Hoffman's master is a bundle of energy and aggravation, and makes a nice foil.

I was disappointed that the other characters were so minor. While I don't watch movies like this for the actors behind the voices, I had expected the Kung Fu heroes to be more a part of things, and to add more dynamics. In fact, they were pretty minor.

The climactic scenes were not as exciting as I would have liked, either. So in the end, the film was a mixture of amusing and creative bits, covered by a layer of predictability. KUNG FU PANDA, no matter how great it looked, could not throw off the unoriginality of story.

I believe kids will like it, and I wasn't exactly bored myself. But whereas TOY STORY and MONSTERS INC have warranted repeat viewings over the years, KUNG FU PANDA will probably NOT earn a space on my movie shelf.",1225411200,6,3576,4.583724569640062
1168468,4,7880879625,"Dreamworks' got a clear winner in Kung Fu Panda. First of all you will fall in love with Po the Panda. And like those innumerable Kung-Fu films, where the unlikely character eventually trains and becomes the hero and fights to vanquish the enemy, Kung Fu Panda leaves no stone unturned in that pursuit. Nearly all the thrills of Kung Fu action, the beauty of comedy (what a fantastic script) and all other ingredients of an enthralling Kung Fu film like the wisodm of the masters, their super skills, training methodology etc., are carefully and beautifully delivered and the package even betters many chinese originals. The characters, the five superheroes, the villain and the masters were all well done. The movie is so very Chinese it is difficult to believe it wasn't from the Shaw Brothers.

As for color and animation I would give full marks. Many of the scenes are in beautiful dramatic colors particularly the Jade Temple scenes.

Don't know how many more hits (songs, movies) are going to be based on the ""I believe"" concept but it doesn't seem to grow or get stale.

My only complaint with Kung Fu Panda is that it was difficult to connect the voices of the stars with the characters including Jack Black's. Jack has a little nasal quality to his voice but it seemed to be totally absent. I had difficultly making out Dustin Hoffman's voice too. Until I read the credits it was difficult to make out the voices of the rest of the cast, like Angelina Jolie as the Tigress and Jackie Chan as the monkey or Lucy Liu as the Snake. Jackie Chan's voice is almost un-recognizable. He also had very little to speak in the movie.

Carl Douglas's hit of the yesteryears, ""Kung Fu Fighting"" at the end reminded me so much of the Disco years. Wonder why no credit was given to Biddu, the guy who composed the music for the hit.

Go for the DVD. You won't regert. Can't wait for the sequel.",1223942400,,1888,4.57396449704142
1168469,5,7880879625,"From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.

I was laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood.

Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of ""The Matrix"" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.

It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.

This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves ""The Incredibles"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Beauty & The Beast."" Has the makings of being a classic.

Enjoy!",1223683200,118,2117,4.820936639118457
1168470,5,7880879625,"You think you've got someone figured out, and then you're proven wrong. I thought Dreamworks was only capable of Shreks and Madagascars (Bee Movie didn't help either). And then they release this visually stunning, captivating and ambitious movie - truly one of THE animated movies of 2008. It really is an incredible anomaly, and one that reinstated my hope in big-budget animated movies. It remains one of the few movies that I've ever seen twice in the cinema, and that is saying something.

The plot is thus; Po, a dreamy but awkward panda bear, hopes to become a kung fu warrior. His dream, however, appears a reality away as he whiles away his days co-running his dad's noodle house. But Po's life changes drastically when he is surprisingly chosen as the 'dragon warrior' by mysterious kung fu master Oogway. Po's new master, Shifu, and his co-students the Furious Five are less than taken with Po to say the least. But as the threat of escaped convict and kung fu master Tai Lung threatens Po's home town, he learns that a little belief in yourself despite all opposition can go a long way. A strong plot with an important and well-delivered message, and fortunately the movie doesn't drag on and on but is frontal and to the point. There's lots of serious moments as well as humorous ones, and as thus it scores highly for integrity.

As an animation enthusiast, however, I feel the visual style alone is the main reason to see this film. The opening sequence is 2-D, and my what a 2-D sequence it is! Personally, that's my favourite part of the film; an almost storybook-esque sequence and still so breathtakingly fluid and full of life, living Po's dream of his possible life as a warrior. The 3-D animation which dominates most of the film is very good, too; clear and brisk, yet cartoony enough. In particular the prison scenes are fabulous. The credit sequence mirrors the opening sequence, and I can tell you that both times when I saw the movie in the cinema, I was one of the few who stayed until the very end just watching it.

In a day and age when so many mediocre 3-D movies are made, Kung Fu Panda stands out of the bunch. It's a milestone in the life of 3-D animated movies, and reminds us that animated movies have a lasting charm just waiting to be captured. In conclusion, a truly inspiring movie, finely balanced between artistic integrity and a humour/action flick. Two thumbs WAY up!",1223683200,,2411,4.6416861826697895
1168471,5,7880879625,"Dreamworks has enjoyed a commercially successful, but critically questionable run of animated films. In the midst of the Shrek Trilogy, Over the Hedge, and Curse of the WereRabbit lie Shark's Tale, Sinbad, and Spirit.
The studio seems to be fumbling for the secret ingredient - well, here they've found it.
Kung Fu Panda takes full advantage of the animation medium, staging fantastic fights and great physical comedy. There is a lot of heart to it, a real sincerity underneath the big studio behemoth. The character design is the best of any Dreamworks film - especially the title character. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are a good chemical fit, but the other big name actors are wasted with characters who maybe utter 10 lines or less.
A film only gets four stars if it's well-crafted, but it can only get five it's all that AND personally touching.  I give it five stars.

The video game to this film is just as entertaining and fun as the film - which is rare. Not bad for a movie game.

1168495,5,7880879625,"Jack Black, kung-fu fighting, and fat pandas? What could go wrong? Apparently nothing if you have the super-powered productions of Dreamworks helping you. Simply put, Kung-Fu Panda is a funny movie. Jack Black brings his AAA game to star as the loveable loser of the animal kingdom, Po the Panda. Po's handle is to fullfill his uncertain destany to become the worlds greatest fighter, AKA the Dragon Warrior, to banish off the evil master Tai Lung. Dreamworks add signature trademark humor, the type that blew Shrek up, but blending it with Chinese backrounds and props gives Panda it's own, special vibe.

 CG animations are amazing, Pixar and Dreamworks alike have expanded their movies by their attention to detail, and it sure does show here. Every portion of every critter's body has been refinished with a fine tooth comb, truly pushing the limits of modern day technology in cinema. Even by a casual glance, it would be hard not to see the exteme textures of the backdrops, characters ect.

 Of course, being a chinese Kung-Fu movie, Panda's gotta have a little bit of fight in it, right? Just lika Jacki Chan movie, there are interlocked, coriographed bad-ass fighting scenes. But since this is animation, Dreamworks takes Panda to a much grander scale of fighting by outragious stunts that could only be portrayed in the animated realm.

1168501,5,7880879625,"With deep foreboding, I walked into this movie braced for second rate animation (at least compared to Pixar), endless fights between cartoons (as in the CGI ""Clone Wars""), and a cultural sensitivity that was either painfully preachy (like ""Mulan"") or outright insulting (like ""Aladdin"").

At first, my dread seemed confirmed.  Poor Dustin Hoffman mangles Chinese names without mercy - so much so that James Hong, Lucy Liu and Jackie Chan have to deliberately mispronounce stuff just to match what he says.

But once the movie got rolling, I found myself grinning from ear to ear in sheer delight.  Yes, it's true, Dreamworks can't compete with Pixar's technology, but they make up for it with beautiful graphic design, sheer wit and - of course - those hilariously quivering ""Scrat Eyes"".  What's more, the animators somehow manage to make Kung Fu battles between cartoons both exciting and enjoyable - every bit the match of live action fights (which nowadays are nothing more than CGI with faces pasted on).

However, the most remarkable thing about this film is how faithful it is to Chinese culture - family dynamics, Buddhist philosophy, values, and even martial arts - this film simply HAS to have been written by Chinese.  There is never a moment where it strains to ""score points"" with political correctness.  Its characters are never tediously noble ""anti-stereotypes"", but are instead lovingly depicted with all their flaws intact while uniquely Chinese messages are delicately hidden within a plot crammed with excitement and laughter.  Here you experience how parental love turns into suffocating pressure, here you see teenage rebellion as a monstrosity rather than a virtue, here you see the quirky characters of a city (complete with that wobbly ""bound foot"" walk), here you hear the wisdom of Zen detachment, and here you experience the sacred relationship between student and teacher.

Perhaps my opinion is biased by the surprise this movie gave to my low expectations, but I can't help but see this film as an unappreciated but precious gem.  Now if only someone could do the same thing with Islamic culture...!",1219881600,175,2130,5.109510086455331

1168547,5,7880879625,"I was on a long flight back from California when I had the choice between watching Kung Fu Panda on a tiny television screen four feet away from me, or read the SkyMall catalog.  I wisely chose to watch Kung Fu Panda.

I was curious as to how Kung Fu Panda would present itself: as a Lion King-style retelling of ancient Chinese myth, or as a love note to kung fu films from an American perspective.  I'm pleased to report that it's the latter.

You know the story: Po (a restrained Jack Black) adores the Furious Five but is too fat and slow to ever hope to become one of them and then fate does precisely that. It's the heroes who have the real problem (each representing a different kung fu style and all voiced by a roster of celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu). Struggling most of all is Master Shifu - a bit redundant, if you know the definition of Shifu - played by Dustin Hoffman (wouldja believe?) who is still suffering from the betrayal of his first and best pupil Tai Lung (Ian McShane).

What's surprising about Kung Fu Panda is how adult the story is.  The word ""kill"" is mentioned several times.  Tai Lung and Shifu have a physical conflict that is much a battle of philosophies as it is a father and son having an argument.  And the plot is beautiful in its symmetry, perfectly tying in every element: from the modified style of kung-food training that Shifu teaches Po to the revelation of Po's (we can only assume adopted) duck-father's secret recipe to the fact that Po is immune to acupuncture (because he's so fat, of course) Kung Fu Panda is tightly scripted and wrapped up in a beautiful package.

The movie itself (what I could see on the tiny airplane screen) is beautifully produced.  It ranges from Chinese-style art to realistic but soft-colored tones, to bursts of color amidst pitch darkness.  The fight scenes are all in exciting locations: in a prison, on a rope bridge, in an ancient temple.  It's like a videogame, only you're watching the fat guy character nobody wants to play. It was beautiful enough that I had a pang of regret that I wasn't watching it on a big screen. Or even a medium screen.

For kids, Po is a great tale about overcoming obstacles by being yourself.  For geeks, Po is a hilarious new hero archetype: the fanboy as hero, a fat, slobbering devotee who knows more details about the Furious Five than they know about themselves.",1218844800,4,2414,4.545034642032332
1168548,3,7880879625,"I did like the movie but it is not on a par with something like Cars.

The story is painfully familiar; unlikely hero trains up to defeat bad guy. Think Star Wars Episode VI, Karate Kid (all episodes), and countless others. In this case, the hero is a noodle-making panda voiced by Jack Black. Jack does a great job but almost everyone else seems to be calling in their performances. There are some laughs, but mostly this is a low-key movie.

I think what soured this film for me was Avatar: The Last Airbender. Avatar covers much of the same ground, but has had years to it. Even so, a single 30 minute episode of Avatar is more interesting and exciting than was KFP.

Even so, if your kids want to take you to see KFP for your birthday, then by all means let them. You could do much worse.",1218412800,2,792,4.266666666666667
1168549,4,7880879625,"The story of ""Kung Fu Panda"" about a lazy panda who dreams of becoming a martial arts fighter may not be as unique as that of last year's Oscar winner ""Ratatouille,"" but Dreamworks' new animated film is great fun nonetheless. Perhaps some viewers (including me) might the miss the biting satire of the same company's ""Shrek,"" but ""Kung Fu Panda"" offers lots of laughs and some engaging characters including Po (voice by Jack Black) and his reluctant master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman).

The film's story will remind you of either ""Star Wars"" (the older trilogy) or ""Drunken Master,"" the latter being a still popular Hong Kong martial arts film made in 1978 starring Jackie Chan (who provides voice for ""Panda"" as Monkey). In short, a wise master reluctantly takes a youngster under his wing. The master thinks it a hopeless case at first, but discovers the talent hidden deep inside the pupil. In Po's case, his talent as martial arts fighter is found when Po is eating, not drinking.

If you look at the kung fu choreography closely, or our hero's ""battle"" sequence in the opening, you will realize that the directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson have carefully studied many kung-fu films. They know the rules of the genre and bend them to create amusing characters, innovative kung-fu battle scenes and funny sight gags. It is amazing to see the slightly overused format for plot based on master and disciple still works even in animation.

That means, however, that some might think the script of ""Kung Fu Panda"" needs more originality. Principal characters are well-drawn and delightful to watch, especially Po and Shifu, but supports are a bit weak (despite the inclusion of such voice actors as Angelina Jolie as Tigress) and the film's narrative, slick as it is, is a bit predictable (though it never bores us).

The film pays homage to some of other martial arts films and even Hollywood actions - some scenes of ""Panda"" are clearly inspired by such works as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and one of ""Indiana Jones"" films - but actually you don't have to notice that at all. This is a hugely enjoyable family-oriented film.",1217980800,,2132,4.865013774104683

Summary in one paragraph:

It is the story of Po the Panda. The most unlikely hero. He is fat, lazy and uncomfortably clumsy. He loves Kung Fu, in fact he has posters of all his Kung Fu idols on his bedroom walls. Son of a very proud noodle maker who wants to leave his super secret recipe to his son once he become mature enough. One day, there was a news of a public special occasion that the Dragon Warrior will be selected at the Jade Temple. Po has to be there to witness such a historical event. Pretending to his father that he will be selling noodles at the event, he arrived late because he has trouble hauling the heavy noodle cart on the stairs that lead to the temple. The gate were now all closed. The strangest thing happened when master Shifu was about to pick the Dragon warrior. Po, attempting every thing just to catch a glimpse of the event, literally fall on the very spot. Nobody can believe it even Po himself, except Oogway, the old (turtle) master who says that everything that happens in this world is not an accident. The main villain is the Snow Leopard ""Tai Lung"" who eventually escaped from his prison and threatened the whole village for his revenge. His main reason was not being chosen as the Dragon Warrior and entrusted the ultimate kung fu secret which is supposedly written on the scroll inside the temple. The great battle has to happen between the Dragon Warrior and Tai Lung. The whole village has to be evacuated. At this time, Po has been handed the scroll but he did not know what to make of it. Finally, it was his father that gave him the real answer to the scroll, the answer lies in the secret noddle recipe.",1217462400,,2284,4.418052256532066
1168551,5,7880879625,"`Kung Fu Panda' is a brilliant film in every possible way. It's one of the funniest animations I have ever seen; whoever wrote the script is a genius. I've never laughed out loud at an animation for such a long period of time.

The first part of the film in `Chinese style' cartoons is a perfect beginning, depicting Po(Jack Black) as some sort of animal animation of a samurai.

Po is a panda and the son of a stork who is descended from a long line of `noodle folk' (yes, it's pretty weird).  Po dreams of kung fu but in reality he makes noodle soup. One day, at a Kung Fu event in which the `Dragon Warrior' will be chosen, it appears that Po's dreams might not be so far out of reach.

The film contains quality animation - it's probably the best to date. The creators of this film truly have a wonderful sense of imagination, as the characters and scenes are so astounding.

Jack Black is wicked-funny as the Panda's voice, you can feel the actor's charisma through the animation. Dustin Hoffman's wonderful `rusty' voice brings the character `Master Chifu' to life; the serious and unamused Kung Fu master.

None of us complained that the movie was not China enough, 'coz nobody expected for that. How could you expect an English speaking panda to be Chinese? If dreamworks ever tried to make *real* Chinese characters, I think they failed on this, badly. All characters in the movie are very American, they were just in Chinese outfits. But still, Po is such a cute lovable panda, and Shifu and Wugui are also impressive. ""The Five"" are a little bit weak. The worse is the bad guy - I cannot even recall his name - it's no personality, just a bad guy.

Although they were used in a little bit exaggerated way (for example, the building style, and the outfits of regular people in the valley), it's relatively better than other *fake* Chinese movies, especially the music.",1215907200,15,1118,4.585

1168595,4,7880879625,"Po (voiced by Jack Black) is a Panda who works at his father's noodle stall. Po has dreams of greatness and looks at the Furious Five, a group of five kung-fu masters, Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey (Jackie Chan), all of whom are under the tutelage of Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Shifu learns Tai Lung (Ian McShane, TV's ""Deadwood""), a fearsome tiger and onetime prot&eacute;g&eacute;, has broken out of the maximum-security prison designed to hold him. Tai Lung wants the Scroll of Destiny. It is up to Shifu's master Oogway to determine which of his Fearsome Five will fight Tai Lung. Eager to see the demonstration, Po garners the attention of Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) and he determines Po will receive the scroll of destiny and fight Tai Lung. Shifu groans because he has a lot of training to do.

""Kung Fu Panda"", the newest animated offering from Dreamworks Animation, the folks behind ""Shrek"", ""Over the Hedge"" and others, is perhaps their most beautiful film yet. The backgrounds are universally beautiful and very pleasing to watch. The attention to detail is striking and a lot of research and work clearly went into depicting this environment, a mountaintop village high above the clouds in China. You really get the feeling you are watching events unfold in rural China, many years ago.

Po, a large Panda, lives with his father, a duck, above their noodle shop, and the attention to detail continues here as well. When Po wakes up, he bangs his head against the ceiling, knocking some pots and pans around. The noodle shop is small and outdoors and this is clearly a rural village. All of this detail is used to great advantage and shows the lengths the filmmakers are willing to go to make a believable, beautiful film.

While the story is also involving and well plotted, it contains few laughs. And this is surprising given the inclusion of Jack Black. I was honestly expecting this film to be funnier, but it is a surprisingly dramatic look at one panda's journey to become an adult. It almost seems like the filmmakers were attempting to make a powerful coming of age story. They have succeeded well in this regard. We feel the need for Po to become a part of the Furious Five. We feel his idol worship and his desire to have some excitement in his life. This leads him to desperately seek a spot to watch the competition between the Furious Five. Then, when he becomes the chosen one, he is naturally reluctant; he doesn't see how he could possibly equal anything close to what his idols already have achieved, what they already are, but he recognizes the call to duty he has received and puts a game foot forward.

As Po trains, he spars with Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Both are good, they just aren't that funny. I think the key problem is everyone is taking the film very seriously. This would be great if ""Panda"" were an animated drama, but it is clearly meant to be funny. There are a few humorous moments and an ongoing joke about Po's need for food, but too much of the film is very serious.

When I told my dad Dustin Hoffman does one of the voices in this film, he asked why an actor of such high esteem would even do such work? Hoffman has, in recent years, taken on a much more diverse range of roles. An actor who used to be known as an Academy Award magnet now regularly takes wacky, supporting roles in films like ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" and animated work. I think a large part of this is because Hoffman is seeking to become more accessible to more people, he wants his work to be seen by more people accounting for the larger variety of roles. Hoffman has always been known for sinking into a role, becoming the character so completely his performance becomes memorable. While the success of his performance in ""Mr. Magorium"" might be debatable, he uses his voice to great effect in ""Kung Fu Panda"". He has a quiet exasperation to his voice when he learns who his new disciple will be. Quiet, because he can't possibly question his master who knows all and his decisions are always right. Exasperated, because he realizes what he has to work with and knows it is all but hopeless. But he presses forward.

Ian McShane is the other standout in the cast. As Tai Lung, a fearsome tiger who is currently imprisoned in a special facility, to keep him away from the rest of the community, he is especially villainous. This is the first DreamWorks villain who can hold a candle to some of the great Disney animated villains, like Captain Hook, the Wicked Queen or Jafar. But again, he plays it mostly straight. Shifu is so afraid he might escape this special prison; he sends one of his emissaries to inform the head guard, an armor plated rhino (Michael Clarke Duncan, ""The Green Mile"") to increase the guard. When the emissary arrives, the guard laughs and explains the safeguards in place to hold Tai Lung. This gives us a glimpse of this special prison and all of the booby traps and safeguards designed to hold this prisoner. Of course, Tai Lung escapes, leading to one of the most elaborately animated, exciting sequences I have ever seen in an animated film.

The rest of the cast is good, but not great and this is one of the factors keeping this film from attaining the greatness it so desperately wants to achieve. Jackie Chan does a good job as Monkey, but his voice is so recognizable, he simply is the character. The same can be said of Lucy Liu, who plays Viper. Each is simply their character, doing a good job of performing the role without bringing anything to it. To be honest, I had to wait until the credits to find out Angelina Jolie plays Tigress. Her performance is extremely low key and unmemorable. In recent years, a lot of animated films have been marketed based on the A-List stars providing voices, included simply for their name value. Many, in turn, simply read their lines, adding little to the characters because they are unable to add to a character using simply their voice. Because of this, many films have suffered. ""Kung Fu Panda"" has examples of this, but Black, Hoffman and McShane save it.

 I recently read that each of the members of the Furious Five practice a different kind of Kung Fu, disciplines that are actually named for the animals they are. This is not something we would probably pick up with the naked eye, while watching the film, but this also points to the level of detail the filmmakers went to to help create this world. It is a beautiful world to travel to. I just wish those travels involved more laughs.",1215388800,,6570,4.613344739093242
1168596,4,7880879625,"...and yet I left the theater unfulfilled.  So now I'm really perplexed.  I love all forms of animation (done well) and I do enjoy well choreographed Kung-Fu action.  This film was at least, better than average in those departments.  I appreciate good voice-over work (it's not that easy) and humble characters; check and check.  Of course, solid story telling and really cool set pieces can make any film memorable.  Kung Fu Panda has all of the above.  So I'm still struggling with the fact that I left the theater less than blown away. I guess I should dissect the situation.

-WHY AM I JADED?
Perhaps I've seen too much animation (is that possible?).  With all the great computer animation that goes on these days, what will it take to impress me?  Prior to KP, a preview for the new computer animated ""Clone Wars"" film was shown.  While 10 years ago, this would have been an event, today it looked pretty crappy; my wife and I sneered.  You'd think KP would look awesome after seeing that.  It probably did look awesome, but what haven't I seen computers do before; nothing.  So, I probably am jaded.  Honestly, most of this film was beautifully done, but it didn't seem to matter; that's really disappointing for me.  No sure answers here.  I'm still missing something.

-WAS THIS A GOOD STORY?
There was absolutely nothing wrong with this story.  It had originality while still paying proper homage to the Kung Fu film traditions.  It had funny moments and beautifully choreographed battles.  It had numerous wonderfully original set pieces to stage the battles and events in.  It had strong continuity and meaningful plot points. It was as predictable as most ""Kids"" films are but still well thought out.  Yet, I felt something was missing?  So far I have managed only to find more questions than answers.  Let's look at the details.  Maybe I'll figure it out there?

-BLACK IS BLACK (I want my baby back?)
Of this I am sure, the panda was Jack Black.  Just as Robin Hood was Kevin Costner and Han Solo was Harrison Ford, Jack black is usually himself regardless of the role.  I like Jack Black (at his worst, I find him tolerable).  However, here he was playing an American Panda.  I couldn't let this slip by.  I could not ignore his American colloquial speech or his fan-boy demeanor.  As loveable as his character was, he seemed completely out of place.  He was funny and charming and disarming and loveable, but he wasn't in any way Chinese.  I know this is ludicrous; he's a freaking Panda for gosh sake!!  But he was in China and he was all American.  As dumb as that is, it just bugged me.  A couple other voices bugged me too (Dustin Hoffman was also too ""American"").  Despite the good ""acting"", I guess this sort of damaged the context of the film for me.

-IS PAYING HOMAGE BECOMING CLICH?
I have produced yet another question (sigh).  How many films pay homage to classic Kung Fu cinema?  I honestly don't know.  I do know it's a lot.  I don't have anything against the genre; I actually enjoy those films.  But maybe I've seen too much?  Maybe it's getting just a little bit tired?  Perhaps I am, once again, jaded?  That really would be too bad since this film has some really cool fight scenes.  I think my problem might be that while paying homage, this film cheats; it's all done with computers.  Doing it with live actors is much more impressive.  My kids liked it though.  This might be a strong answer (finally).

-HOW DEEP IS DEEP ENOUGH?
GEEZE!!! ANOTHER QUESTION!!!  The point is, is there enough depth in these characters?  I'm thinking maybe not, especially for ""The Five"".  These are the Kung Fu ""masters"" of the film and yet, all we really know about them is their fighting styles.  They are all really cool on the surface, but have only a little depth.  Some fringe characters were more highly developed.  I'm not sure how you develop 5 characters more deeply in an animated feature.  I supposed being ""cool"" should be enough; jaded?  I've definitely seen worse.  Though fairly shallow, they are cool.

-DID YOU LIKE IT OR NOT MORON!!!???
That's the only question you want answered, I'm sure.  Well, obviously I was divided by this film; half of me admired its honesty, attention to detail and faithfulness to the Kung Fu genre.  The other half became distracted by annoying details that spoiled it's ""authenticity"" a bit.  Because this was homage to the Kung Fu genre, the story followed a somewhat familiar format.  So the story, though well executed, was not completely fresh. The action, though beautifully staged, was only a pile of bits and bytes leaping around the screen and not real people and therefore, less impressive. I guess my personal ""WOW"" bar has been raised by the limitless potential of computer graphics, and thus I have become a bit jaded.  Despite my lack of enthusiasm, I would have to recommend that you and your kids see Kung Fu Panda.  It is a well made film that should still excite young minds and un-jaded adults alike.",1215388800,,4985,4.658227848101266
1168597,4,7880879625,"Po the panda (Black) wants to be a martial arts expert.  Unfortunately for him, he is working for his father (Hong) making noodle soup.  One day, at the nearby temple, Master Oogway (Kim) has a vision that the evil Tia Lung (McShane) will escape from prison and wreak havoc.  Now Oogway must determine who will be the Dragon Warrior, and defeat Tia Lung.  The five contenders are: Monkey (Chan), Tigress (Jolie), Viper (Liu), Crand (Cross), and Mantis (Rogen), all apprentices of Master Shifu (Hoffman).  Somehow, all of them are overlooked and Po is chosen.  Now, Po must find it within himself to save the village, as Tia Lung has just escaped.

""Kung Fu Panda"" is an entertaining, action packed film.  The voice talents are all well chosen, especially Jack Black as the titular panda.  The humor works, and adults and children will enjoy this film.  The animation, while good, is about what one has come to expect in animated films.  The animation bar is high, and ""Kung Fu Panda"" makes it over, but does not blow it away.  ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a good family movie, and I recommend it.",1215043200,,1086,4.657894736842105

I generally haven't cared for Jack Black or his movies, but he voiced Po the panda pretty well, I must say. Dustin Hoffman was excellent as the voice of Shifu. My only question was why were Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu even in this movie since their characters were completely overlooked? Each had only a handful of lines, if that. Kind of like having Steve Irwin's voice in Happy Feet, blink and you'll miss them. Angelina Jolie's tigress did most of the talking for the 5 warriors. Overall the movie was entertaining, fast-paced and lots of fun. It even delivers a great message for kids and adults too for that matter...you really CAN aspire to be whatever it is you WANT to be.

1168600,5,7880879625,"The tagline from the movie preview was certainly enticing: PREPARE FOR AWESOMENESS!

So, on Thursday afternoon, my gym buddy & I decided to go & watch the latest movie from Dreamworks Animation, 'Kung Fu Panda', at Jurong Point.

It was a hilarious & yet heart-warming movie as the whole movie theatre was roaring with laughter from start to finish.

In fact, we were surrounded by many kids & their parents, as part of their June school holiday outings.

In a nut shell, the movie was all about the adventures (or misadventures?) of a young goofy Panda named Po (voiced by Jack Black) with big dreams of becoming a kung fu fighter in the village, known as the Valley of Peace.

By day, he was a lowly cook/waiter in the noodle restaurant of his father, Mr Ping, a goose (James Hong; this incomprehensible relationship wasn't explained in the movie) & by night he often fantasised as a side-kick to the formidable fighting quintet, known as the Furious Five, comprising Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) & Monkey (Jackie Chan). They happened to be his fondest idols.

One day, by a stroke of serendipity, & with accidental fireworks of course, he gate-crashed a village tournament organised by Master Shifu, a small mustachioed red panda (Dustin Hoffman) under the watchful eye of a aging but wise turtle named Oogway. The latter was apparently the Grand Master, who seemed to have a fondness for fortune-cookie aphorisms.

Their principal objective was to elect the Dragon Warrior to deal with impending havoc from a vengeful & treacherous snow leopard, Tai Lung (Ian McShane).

The latter was locked up - in fact, he was the only prisoner - in a maximum security monolithic prison, built like a fortress with imposing defence mechanisms & guarded by a large bunch of armoured rhinoes. Somehow, the Grand Master had this premonition that this menacing rascal would soon break out of prison.

Against the wishes of Master Shifu, as well as to the chagrin of the Furious Five, especially Tigress, who was the one most eligible for the title, & of course to his own bewilderment, Po was inadvertently elected by the Grand Master as the Dragon Warrior.

In the next part of the movie, Master Shifu & the Furious Five tried to make life extremely miserable for Po, hoping that he would quit.

They eventually had to make a reluctant turnaround to train him as the Dragon Warrior, after seeing that this big fat, easily distracted but perpetually hungry, young apprentice had some endearing value in him, especially for his genuine love just to be like the Furious Five.

To his great delight, Po was put through a rigorous crash course under the tutelage of Master Shifu, who found that dumplings was a powerful motivator for his new apprentice to get going.

It was real fun to watch the clumsy Po going through all the training manoeuvres with - as well as all the whacking by - Master Shifu.

The lightning-fast chopstick routines with the last dumpling in a bowl was a memorable classic.

I like the part when he finally grasped the last dumpling with his chopsticks, & instead of eating it, he threw it back to his master, & said ""I'm not hungry"". Wow! I could see the grin on Master Shifu's face, subtly acknowledging that the young disciple had finally made the grade.

In the remaining half of the movie, we saw the spectacular breakout from prison by Tai Lung, his ferocious battle with the Furious Five at the rope bridge, & his ruthless assault on Master Shifu, during which all the good guys were badly defeated.

In the last climatic scene, Po appeared suddenly & after some fancy footwork & playful routines, he eventually beat the hell out of the rogue fighter, who once had also the dream to become the Dragon Warrior.

According to the story, Tai Lung was brought up from a young puppy by Master Shifu with the hope of becoming the ultimate warrior. Unfortunately, because of his ulterior motives (lost to the dark side, so to speak), he was defeated & banished by the Grand Master to the mountain prison for twenty years. This explained why he was really sore about the whole affair.

To be frank, both my gym buddy & I were mesmerised by the well-choreographed, visually-stunning action sequences, against the backdrop of photo-realistically textured computer-generated imagery - vast, moody, misty landscapes, pastel sunsets, hazy mountain vistas, dewy flowering trees, fanciful interiors, & traditional Chinese colors (dominated by red & gold) - throughout the entire movie of almost ninety minutes' length.

I must say Kung Fu Panda is the best animation movie I have watched so far. Talent-wise, both Jack Black & Dustin Hoffman had brought life to the entire show with their characters' voices.

The most poignant scene was the part when the Grand Master handed the final baton, so to speak, to Master Shifu, & after that, he just evaporated gradually into the thin mountain air, amidst a delicate swirl of pink petals. Wow!

The last scene, just before the credit titles, was amusing & wonderful too, while both Master Shifu & Po were lying, in peace so to speak, with their backs on the temple steps, & Po suddenly asked: ""Shall we go & get something to eat?""

More importantly, at least for me, there are many valuable lessons to be learned from the movie for young people, as follows, especially drawing from the witty dialogue:

1) ""There are no accidents.""

- Everything happens for a reason. We just have to learn to find the true meaning of the events in our lives. No matter what happens to us, not only does something valuable come out of it, but it may be just what we need.

2) ""A real warrior never quits.""

3) ""One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.""

- This certainly resonates very well with what William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925), well-known US Congressman, once said: ""Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for; it is a thing to be achieved.""

Many of our trials & heartaches are not designed to make us bitter but better in life. The fact is, troubles do not always last, but tough people do.

The only people I know with no trials, troubles & challenges are those in the graveyard.

4) ""To make something special, you just have to believe that it is.""

- If you believe in yourself, you can do anything, including creating miracles;

5) ""You are too concerned with 'what was' & 'what will'. Yesterday was history; tomorrow is a mystery, & today is a gift; that's why it's called a present.""

- Don't waste time. Seize the day!

6) ""The mark of a true hero is humility.""

- Definitely, well said.

7) ""You have to let go off your illusion of control.""

- This was the vital message from the Grand Master to Master Shifu, as the latter struggled incessantly to understand the ultimate decision to train Po as the chosen one;

Likewise, sometimes in life, we tend to want to control everything that goes around us, which often cause us to lose touch with the greater picture or larger reality of our life;

8) ""There are no good news or bad news; just news.""

- It's not what had happened to us, it's what we choose to think & do with what had happened;

9) ""There isn't any secret ingredient.""

- It's already in each & every one of us. This was reflected in the movie, when Po found out that there wasn't anything written - it was actually blank, with a reflective surface - in the Dragon Scroll, which was believed to grant limitless power.

Likewise, when he found out, to his dismay, from his father that there wasn't anything special in the noodles, either.

10) ""The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weaknesses & make him suffer for it.""

- In the movie, Master Shifu grudgingly realised that Po had this natural propensity to hunt for food & would go to great length, with physical prowess, to attain it. So Master Shifu exploited it as powerful motivator for Po to pay attention to his training.

As a matter of fact, Po also unwittingly realised that his greatest weaknesses - cheeky playfulness, roly poly belly & bouncing butt of fat & fuzz - turned out to be his greatest strengths, when fighting Tai Lung, who was terribly cynical of his opponent. Naturally, his physical prowess following the exhaustive training under Master Shifu helped, too.

11) It's OK to say 'I don't know'.

- In the movie, both the Grand Master & Master Shifu demonstrated that.

When Master Shifu confronted the Grand Master: ""But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power to become the Dragon Warrior?"", the latter responded: ""I don't know.""

In the same vein, when Po challenged Master Shifu: ""How are you gonna change me into the Dragon Warrior? How?"", the latter retorted: ""I don't know"".

In the real world, we often don't like to admit this, for fear of being ridiculed or of looking stupid among our peers.

12) A master can only show the path or the way. It is up to the student to reclaim or rediscover the greatness within.

That's how Po rediscovered his own gift - his renewed self-confidence, courage, determination, perseverance, tenacity against impossible odds, & of course, his genuine love of kung fu.

13) Last, but not least: ""There's no charge for awesomeness or attractiveness.""

- It's very true. It's already inside all of us, in whoever we are & whatever we do.

Mums & Dads, please go & watch this wonderful movie quickly with your kids & use the movie to share vital life lessons.

1168601,4,7880879625,"This movie was a real treat.  I basically didn't care for the idea of a Kung Fu movie, but I loved that Jack Black vocalized the main role.  I also totally was on board when I heard Seth Rogan had a part. (He's turned into quite the voice artist; he was wonderful in Horton Hears A Who and hilarious as the voice of a magical creature in Spiderwick Chronicles).  Now I don't mind watching a kids animated movie with my children.  Most of the time I'm at least slightly bored.  But this movie soars above similar movies...for instance Madagascar, Over the Hedge, etc. The plot line was clever and cute.  The story line didn't dumb things down for the kids...and the jokes were just plain funny.  Po was a character worth rooting for and so were his colleagues. The story often kept away from doing the expected thing which in turn made the movie all the more fun and entertaining.  This is one of the few animated 'kid' movies that I think is worth at least a matinee price to go see. Adults, as well as kids, should have a great time at this movie.",1214265600,,1048,4.338461538461538
1168602,5,7880879625,"I enter this movie with one question:  Was Jack Black born to play the voice of Po, or was he merely groomed to play it?  I wouldn't be surprised if the whole movie were centered with him in mind.  `Kung Fu Panda' is another Dreamworks' production, one that employs or improves admirable animation tricks--giving the film the vitality of a free-flowing digital puppet show.  A visual delight, the film has the innovation of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Surf-s-Up-Full-Screen-Special-Edition/dp/B000UFIYP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Surf's Up (Full Screen Special Edition)</a>' combined with the entertainment value of `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratatouille/dp/B000VBJEEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratatouille</a>'.  Sent mostly on the fast track, the film has a good ol' witty time matched with artful adventure.

Literally and figuratively, Po (Black) dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master.  He's a chubby Panda bear who has more passion for eating than making the food at his family's noodle restaurant.  As he's humoring his stork father, a crisis develops in the village:  A prophecy states Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a dragon more aptly described as a snow leopard with pouncing Kung Fu proficiency will escape Chorgum Prison. The town converges on Jade Square, the center of The Valley of Peace where holy wise tortoise, Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), will announce the chosen Dragon Warrior.  Clumsily, Po propels himself in the center where Oogway, pointing at Tigress has his finger on the panda instead.

All the voices are right on.  Jack Black as already mentioned makes all the ""That's cool,"" aphorisms work through his own hapless character.  Happily his lines lack the hyperactivity of Po's training or Black's own character past.  (""I know you're being all mystical and Kung Fu-ooey,"" he chortles.)  Hardly discernible is Dustin Hoffman, perfectly cast as the quiet curmudgeon master trainer, Shifu (Chief-u).  Some of the funniest scenes go along with Po's training.  ""There is now a level zero!"" he proclaims after Po's first session.  There's also an acupuncture scene that makes a point of Po's ridiculous novice status.  Flanking him are the furious five, including Lucy Liu (a viper), Seth Rogen (a preying mantis), Jackie Chan (monkey), David Cross (a crane) and Angelina Jolie (Tigress), each brings a certain perfection to their parts.  They're all Shifu's prodigies, and each sport some superhero Kung Fu moves as well as resentful remarks for their new dragon slayer trainee.

Adding fortune cookie wisdom to the mix both illuminates and entertains.  (""One takes one's destiny on the road to avoid it."" and ""There's no such thing as an accident.""  Now I may be all wrong, but I thought Freud said that one.)  Everyone from director Jack Stevenson to editor Clare Knight deserve kudos for assembling such a fine feature.  Containing a well done script, shaking up the animation formula, and mixing funny with fabulous action scenes, 'Kung Fu Panda' may be the one to beat in the animation category when it comes to Oscar time.",1214265600,22,3136,5.510460251046025
1168603,3,7880879625,"Looking for an animated film that the whole family can watch and enjoy? Then the summer has a good selection in Kung Fu Panda, a magical tale of talking animals, martial arts, eastern philosophy, and good versus evil.  It is also voiced by several well known stars not the least of which is the force of nature that is Jack Black.

Panda bear Po (Jack Black) works for his father's noodle business in ancient China but yearns for something more.  His interest in martial arts leads him to being an accidental selection as the `chosen one' to defend the local town from a vengeful leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former student of the wise, martial arts teacher, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman).  As the `chosen one', Po is given the sacred Dragon Scrolls and is trained by Shifu in the ways and technique of Kung Fu much to the consternation of the Furious Five, the current crop of warriors.  Po presents the ultimate challenge both physically and mentally to Shifu until the master hits on an unorthodox idea.  As Tai Lung approaches and the Furious Five attempt to defend the town, Po must learn the ways of the true warrior.  As he begins to mature and learn about himself, he becomes the last line of defense.

This story nicely blends serious themes with moments of comedic fun.  What is refreshing in the humor is that it is organic and timeless without resorting to pop references (as in Shrek)-no small feat.  It also depicts the ancient Chinese warriors with not only martial arts prowess, but abilities to defy gravity as in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Children will find a wondrous, far away land populated by real people in the guise of animal characters.  It is a believable world with real feelings of yearning, tradition, envy, and bravery.

A somewhat more subdued Jack Black does a fine job emoting and realizing the young Po.  Dustin Hoffman is quite good as the wise sage, a sort of Asian Yoda (or the other way around).  It's rather hard to believe the star power behind the other voices including Angelina Jolie,  Jackie Chan, and Seth Rogen.  The movie could have worked just as well without them.

The movie actually gets better in the middle and toward the end, not that long a wait.  Its basic themes of destiny and loyalty are universal.  As Master Shifu says, ""there are no accidents.""  The animation and creative use of camera angles and zooms are breath taking at times.  You kind of wish the script had just a bit more substance and this would have become a treasured classic.  As it is, Kung Fu Panda is a delightful, inoffensive adventure with something for all ages.",1214179200,,2597,4.65934065934066
1168623,5,7880879625,"Kung Fu Panda is one of those movies that comes along once every couple of years, it gives you a good message without being patronising in the Disney movie type of way. It shows you a positive outlook on life while giving you genuine laughs without shoving slapstick comedy in your face. I would generally consider constructing my reviews on a pros and cons basis but it's difficult to do that with a film that is simply perfect in every way. I will, however, give you a list of my favourite points of the movie and discuss them in a bit more detail.

The Cast: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jacky Chan, Lucy Liu and many more. I don't think you can get a more star studded cast than this and they all deliver their own special brand of humour and great voice acting to the roles. Some characters are less funny than others which with a movie like this is to be expected. Together they all make this movie even more memorable.

The Animation: With a fully CGI movie it's going to get put in the same category as films like Shrek and Toy Story for the simple reason that it's a fully computer animated movie. Of course if you're going to make a movie about a panda who wants to learn Kung Fu, CGI is an inevitable way to go in order to bring this story to life. The animation for this movie is incredible, it gives us a slick blend of cartoon animation and detailed surroundings which helps make the movie that bit more realistic.

The Comedy: From one of the first opening lines being ""He blinded his enemies with his awesomness"" you knew this movie would be a high quality comedy. Jack Black as the lead character, Po, makes this movie great as he brings his typical silliness and projects it through his voice and into the character. At times I could genuinely believe Jack Black would be capable of playing the physical role of Po as the slapstick moments are something you can imagine Jack being a part of.

The Story: The story itself from the get go you can sort of work out where they're going with it. Po, a clumsy Panda bear works for his father making noodles but he dreams of one day becoming a Kung Fu master. Meanwhile up in the jade palace current Kung Fu master Oogway decides he must choose a Kung Fu warrior to receive the dragon scrolls which are believed to be the key to becoming the greatest Kung Fu warrior in history. Po must see this ceremony and whilst trying to get over the walls of the jade palace he finds himself being chosen as the one to receive the scrolls but first he must be trained by Shifu.

Overall it's a really good movie and when finally released on DVD is something that everybody must own.",1214006400,,2647,4.371951219512195
1168624,3,7880879625,"KUNG FU PANDA is a perfectly acceptable entry in the ever growing list of CGI animated films.  Yet, because the list is not yet long enough to stretch back more than one generation, it is inevitable that the film be compared to TOY STORY I & II, INCREDIBLES, SHREK, ICE AGE, MONSTERS INC, FINDING NEMO, ROBOTS, etc. etc.  This may not be entirely fair (it's not like we compare a film like UNFORGIVEN to every western ever made)...but it's true nonetheless.  Upon leaving the theatre, my first thoughts were, ""well, it's better than SHARK'S TALE and ROBOTS and ICE AGE II...but isn't up there with RATATOUILLE and SHREK either.""  I should be judging it on its own terms.  So I'll try to do that.

This is a fairly standard ""sports underdog"" movie in many ways.  The hapless Panda, voiced by Jack Black, is clumsy, overweight and hardly built to excel in Kung Fu, a sport / art form which he knows inside-out (as a mega-fan would).  Yet, when a serious threat to his town is unleashed, a wise old turtle comes to believe that this Panda may be ""the dragon warrior"" of legend, the ""one"" who can save them all.

Panda thinks this idea is pretty ridiculous, BUT it gives him a chance to hang out with some of his heroes, true Kung-Fu artists such as Tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Cricket, Snake, etc.  He relishes being with them, and even blows off most of their insults and mockery.

But his ""master"" (Dustin Hoffman, doing a really nice job here) is compelled to train Panda, even though he thinks it is a waste of time.  What do YOU think?  Will Panda find new talents in himself that he never suspected he had?  Will he earn the respect of his heroes?  Will he save the town?

I won't answer these questions here...but suffice it to say that you know the answers to these questions before the movie even starts.  This is a film where the journey to the answers is the key.

The journey is amusing enough.  The Chinese village is rendered lovingly, hinting at the feeling of watercolor painting, yet staying true to the almost 3D style of the best CGI films.  There is no question the movie looks great.  Within these settings, the journey unfolds with funny scenes showing the clumsy Panda attempting Kung Fu.  Yes, there's even a training montage.

In fact, the plot is so predictable that the film would be thoroughly tedious were it not for the relationship between master and student.  Black's Panda is a nice creation...he's funny & smart, and while he feels overmatched physically, he doesn't actually seem to think there's anything wrong with that.  He gets down on himself at times...but is remarkably resilient.  Essentially, even if his self-confidence is low (he knows he is not likely to be a pure Kung Fu genius) his self-ESTEEM is always high.  Hoffman's master is a bundle of energy and aggravation, and makes a nice foil.

I was disappointed that the other characters were so minor.  While I don't watch movies like this for the actors behind the voices, I had expected the Kung Fu heroes to be more a part of things, and to add more dynamics.  In fact, they were pretty minor.

The climactic scenes were not as exciting as I would have liked, either.  So in the end, the film was a mixture of amusing and creative bits, covered by a layer of predictability.  KUNG FU PANDA, no matter how great it looked, could not throw off the unoriginality of story.

I believe kids will like it, and I wasn't exactly bored myself.  But whereas TOY STORY and MONSTERS INC have warranted repeat viewings over the years, KUNG FU PANDA will probably NOT earn a space on my movie shelf.",1213833600,2,3602,4.583724569640062
1168625,5,7880879625,"My ten year old is currently working on his senior red belt in karate, so when we started seeing trailers for KUNG FU PANDA I knew it wouldn't be long before we'd have to see it.  Sure enough, opening weekend arrived and we took our seats.

I'm a big fan of kids' cartoon movies, really looking forward to WALL-E, but I wasn't too sure of this one.  Jack Black can be hit or miss with me, and I really wasn't aware that Dustin Hoffman, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, and Angeline Jolie were involved with the movie until the end credits rolled.  The voices sounded familiar, but that's not unusual given the quality of voice work these days.

The opening montage of the movie made me sit up and take notice at once, though.  That artwork alone was worth the price of admission to me, and if they'd produced the movie in that format it would have been interesting to see what kind of reaction reviewers would give the finished product.

The movie quickly settles into predictability, though, but it's a pleasant trip and I was satisfied.  My son was ecstatic as he watched the events unfold.  He wasn't surprised at the plot's twists and turns either, but the bright color, rapid pacing, and quick action is mesmerizing for the adult mind as well.

Po, the Kung Fu panda of the title, works in his father's noodle kitchen.  His father is a goose and the explanation for that is never given, though it is a distraction during a more serious moment when Po's father reveals an important secret to him.  Black provides a great vocal characterization of Po and I found myself rooting for him even though I knew he didn't really have anything to worry about.

The villain sequences were actually chilling.  Seeing Tai Lung (Ian McShane) held in prison was impressive when you realized what he had to escape from in order to become the all-encompassing threat deal would have to deal with.  The darkness and threat of those scenes might cause some concern for younger children, but I loved the cinematography and the amazing choreography of Tai Lung's escape.

The unwillingness of the Furious Five to embrace Po as a student is as predictable as his eventual winning them over.  But the pacing makes that easy to absorb and enjoy.  The relationship between Shifu (Hoffman) and Oogway is warm and moving, and the scene where the great turtle ascends to the Celestial Heavens is powerful.

After everyone learns that Tai Lung has escaped and is once more menacing the countryside, the Furious Five launch into interception mode and go after him.  Again, the fight sequences are huge and enjoyable, truly knockout efforts.  But it's no surprise that they're defeated.

Shifu takes Po off for lesson and the sequence where Po becomes the Dragon Warrior is a lot of fun.  Still, after Po is trained and ends up getting the Dragon Scroll (which is gotten with Oogway's staff in a marvelous little puzzle piece), everything still looks like they're going to lose anyway.

While helping the villagers abandon town, Po speaks to his father and gains an incredible insight that causes him to stand his ground against Tai Lung.  I have to admit that the thinking behind this reveal wasn't all that deep, but it was effective.  And it proved to be the catalyst the brings about the battle between Po and Tai Lung.  That fight is a great one, and even though I knew Po would win, I still found myself sitting on the edge of my seat.  My son was doing the same thing.

KUNG FU PANDA doesn't break any new ground when it comes to children's animated entertainment, but it sure serves up a feast that hits the spot.  This is one you'll enjoy on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the kids, then again when it comes out on DVD.",1213833600,,3690,4.597859327217125
1168626,5,7880879625,"I treated my son and his 6 yr. old daughter(my granddaughter) to this movie today,and we loved it.

Very,very funny,'non-offensive' humor throughout. The most consistent humor I have seen in a long time,and when was the last time that you heard the audience applaud at the end of a movie? They did after this one ended. Judging by all the laughter we heard,most,if not all were enjoying it very much.

 It is also beautiful to look at. Wonderful writing and production values,all around. Deserves to win ALL the awards!

If your family missed seeing this in the theater,be sure to treat yourselves to the DVD. I don't think anyone would regret it.",1213488000,,647,4.75
1168627,5,7880879625,"Po, the roly poly clumsy panda, loves kung fu, but he needs energy, courage, and technique. His father, a goose, who makes and sells fabulous noodle soup, wants Po to continue in the family business, become a noodle nabob. By accident Po is named the Dragon Warrior. Kung fu master Shifu has to train Po to fight the evil leopard.
One of the most exciting and elaborate scenes in the movie is the one where the evil snow leopard, Tai Lung, escapes from a prison where he is the only prisoner held captive by hundreds of guards. Later he defeats the Famous Five Kung Fu Warriors.
The art work with its insistence upon authentic detail and beauty is particularly noteworthy. Many moments on screen feel as if you are viewing exquisite and stunning paintings of old China. The animation is outstanding.
Some of the scenes are ripped right from the old short cartoon repertoire: someone is hurled a great distance into the sky. Seconds pass. No sign of the person. An apprehensive look into the sky. Then a double take as suddenly the person comes hurtling at great speed to a death-defying crash.
There are elaborate kung fu fight scenes. The training scenes are great. At one point a low blow causes Po to be hit in ""his tenders.""
Po, a loser, learns that the secret ingredient in life is motivation, will power, and belief in oneself. The journey Po takes from laughing stock to super hero, is a frequent passage taken by anti-heroes in kids' movies.
The movie has an excellent website. It will tell you about all the famous actors whose voices and kung fu techniques were used.",1213401600,,1577,4.635714285714286

When a former student turned foe of Master Shifu escapes from prison, a dragon warrior must be appointed to keep tranquility in the Valley of Peace.  Kung fu fanatic Po is chosen ""accidentally"" to become the dragon warrior and battle Tai Lung, the nemesis of Shifu.

Animated movies are not just for kids anymore as ""Kung Fu Panda"" adds to the growing list of animated movies that have come out the passed few years that adults can enjoy and laugh along with their kids to.  ""Panda"" is however, the most entertaining animated movie of the year.  Non stop laughter and an incredibly fun movie to be enjoyed by all.  By the end of this movie, you'll be kicking for more.

1168629,1,7880879625,Kung Fu Panda was a terrible movie! I really expected more from this star studded cast. Especially Jack Black and Jackie Chan. My five year old and I went to see it and were bored with it (I fell asleep in the theatre). It was all we could do to stay in our seats. We were in the theatre with many other people and you couldn't hear one laugh throughout the entire movie. The only good thing about the movie was the animation. What a waste of money!,1213315200,4,449,4.113636363636363
1168630,5,7880879625,"I went to see this film recently. And let me tell you...it was awesome!!! This movie should win the Academy Award! I personally liked it better than the Shrek films! The movie has a great story, lots of humor, memorable characters, and a big, fat, panda! A true classic!

The movie itself is a breath of fresh air. This film is a classic in the making. Worth going to see in the theater and buying it when it comes out on DVD!",1213315200,,426,4.195121951219512
1168631,4,7880879625,"I'm just this guy, y'know? I yam what I yam, and no one to date thought very much of it. Maybe the opposite, if you focus on a wedgied eighth grade. But I'd give anything to be this way-awesome master of way-awesome beatdown skills (on all those guys who beat me down, at least), as long as it isn't too hard. Heck, I'd take a fair beating too - not like I haven't done it before - as long as the cool guys let me hang with them.

If you're still with me, then KFP is your ultimate fantasy. The golden goal is to find that unique power that each of us has within. Yeah, and everybody wins the race and gets a hug at the end. But maybe, just maybe, that one thing about you really can stand tall in some squirrely place in the world. Then, you are Po. Po Panda.

Perhaps there's a reference here to Li Po, the classic drunken poet - perhaps not. I really don't care. It's just a fun flick with lots of satire on the traditional ""work hard forever"" themes that don't work so well in the current decade. Po is the guy you really want to like, even if he's ... well, y'know, not so hard-working.

The animation matches the best of today's, and voice casting backs up the animated characters as well as any. My one kvetch, and little, is that Angelina Jolie's voice was way too smooth for Master Tigress. My ears just kept looking for a rocky rasp that her honeyed soprano never delivered. My problem, not yours, not hers.

As long as you don't take the martial arts too seriously, this is a charming and humorous riff on taking them seriously. See it and laugh at it. If you can be polite about all the rest, it's warm fuzzy fun.
