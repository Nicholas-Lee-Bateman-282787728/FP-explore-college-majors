""Cherry,  Harry and Raquel,"" from 1970, is basically a mess and thank God features an overdose of Uschi Digard in a nonsensical role as ""Soul,"" some sort of mystical spirit that basically dances around naked the whole film (and really...did any other actress in history have breasts that good?). It's the same sort of idea that Meyer played around with later in some other films. Without her this is a poorly-edited trainwreck that is darn near impossible to follow; something about drug running, but it's cut to pieces and looks like a Frankenstein project. BTW lots of toplessness here from the gorgeous leading women, but very little beyond that. The X rating of the day stretched a long way.

""Common-Law Cabin,"" 1967, is (to date) the most plot-heavy Meyer film that I've ever seen. Which isn't to say that it's particularly good, only that it's a little easier to follow than the rest. Part of that might be because it's older, and the most obvious sign of that is that there is absolutely no frontal nudity and only very fleeting rear nudity (there is some partial nudity). The title doesn't tip you off in any way as to the plot, which is about a man, a woman, his daughter by a previous relationship and an old boatman's little resort getaway in the  middle of nowhere. More specifically it's about how a doctor and his wife, and a crooked police officer (who, unbeknownst to the others, stole a bunch of government money), visit this broken-down resort and the cop's antics cause the whole thing to spin out of control. It's a weird premise and a weird film, but in the context of Meyer's other works is pretty straight-laced. I found myself incredibly disappointed, though, that we never get to see the pontoon-busted Babette Bardot fully topless which would have warranted an improved star score from me.",1415404800,,1981,4.766763848396502

8233808,4,B000VCY9WC,"This is not so much a review of the movie (it is a good, but not great Meyer film) as it is a note that the disc should play in US DVD players.  Even though this disc is listed as non-USA format, I have played it on 3 cheapie DVD players (all $50 or less)from 3 different manufacturers.  All of the players were region 1 DVD players.
Anyhow, I just thought I would mention this in case any US customers were thinking about picking this film up.",1234915200,3,444,4.091954022988506
