6108085,4,B00GSTHCSK,"Watching Ranma growing up I was looking very forward to finally having a Blu-ray release of the series. Having received my copy today there were a few surprises that I wasn't expecting:

First, the English subtitles CAN NOT be turned off with the Japanese audio on. While for most this is not an issue I don't need them and they get in the way. A little creative remastering can fix this though.

Second, This is aptly named ""Set 1"" as it is NOT Season 1. It contains all 18 episodes of the original anime (Ranma ), sometimes called Season 1, and 5 episodes from the second Ranma anime (Ranma  Netthen) that was made, some refer to it as Season 2. I never owned the North American DVD releases so I do not know if this is how they were divided as well.

Video and Audio are great considering the source is from the late-80's.

I would recommend this to a friend.",1395360000,5,862,4.329192546583851
6108086,5,B00GSTHCSK,Looks and sounds great.  very small minor notices of the conversion but what do you expect from an anime from 1989.  but still loving the quality. exactly what i expected.  i know it is not released yet. i did not order from amazon. i ordered from rightstuf and received my order early.,1394928000,,286,4.461538461538462
6108087,5,B00GSTHCSK,"Cant wait for this series to get released on bluray. As much as i would love to pre-order from amazon, i had to do it threw rightstuf.com, they charging only 39.99 for the season.

Im hoping that now that this show is going ot get released on bluray that they will do they same that they did with inuyasha and make a final season to catch up wiht the manga. This is old school anime, but its deff a classic, glad to see its coming out!",1393804800,10,435,4.058139534883721
6108088,4,B00GSTHCSK,"This is a crazy, crazy anime that came out in 1989, and then first introduces to the States I believe in 1993. The series is based on a popular manga comic by the same name. It's about Ranma, a boy who is a martial arts student who one day fell into a mystic pond cursed by the tragic death of a girl. Now every time Ranma gets his with cold water he turns into a girl. This brings about all sorts of situation comedy situations as he trains in the ""anything goes"" martial arts school (a joke on the rigid focus on a single fighting style dojos had at the time) that also houses the sensei's three daughters. To top it all off Ranma's dad also fell into a mystic pond that is similarly cursed, but he turns into a panda. Both turn back to themselves when hit with warm or hot water. A lot like those color changing toys.

That in of itself makes for some potential funny stuff, but it gets even more complicated. Akane, one of the daughters, is betrothed to Ranma. The family knows about the curse and figure since Akane is aggressive and put off my most boys, and Ranma is a boy only half the time, they would get along. On top of that odd courtship where they both start off not too keen on each other you have school jock who is also after Akane... and is also in love with Ranma's female side (not knowing it's also his rival for Akane's attention). But it doesn't stop there.

One of Ranma's martial arts rivals also ends up falling into a cursed spring and turns into a piglet when he gets wet. Akane's not aware of this and finds the piglet adorable, much to Ranma's chagrin. Add yet again to that a lecherous grand master with an underwear fetish and another character who falls into a cursed pool (is Japan just pot-marked with these ponds?) and turns into a duck. Not to mention a score of other oddball, and sometimes dangerous, girls who chase after Ranma. Now pull all of this into a weekly sitcom style show and you get an idea just how crazy things get.

This Blu-Ray set is a special edition comes in a premium chipboard artbox with gold foil stamping and that includes a 64 page episode guide that includes a sample of the remastered manga. You get first 23 episodes as they were released by Viz Media both the original Japanese audio as well as the original English dub plus English subtitles along with the following extras:

- Ranma 1/2 Panel at New York Comic Con

- Highlight Reel of New York Comic Con Viz Media Events

- ""We Love Ranma"" Part 1 Manga Remastering Interview with Hope Donovan.

This release is indeed remastered to 1080p high definition. Most of the differences I noticed are an all around renewed life to the image with brighter colors and contrast. Ranma is one of the wildest love triangle comedies made. It's rated for teen viewing due to a bit of animated topless girls, but the violence is bloodless and more or less cartoonish at times. If you are a fan of this series this is definitely the best way to get it now.",1393372800,7,2960,4.351449275362318

6108139,5,B00GSTHCSK,"I have the Viz DVD sets and they are still to this the better versions of an old anime. So if you have them, theres really no need to get the Blu-ray versions but if you still have vhs or new to Ranma then do get the blu-rays.
Not sure wether  the older blurays are better then the newer blurays being re-release, you'll have to decide.
Ranma and his father go to China for martial arts training in the Cursed Drowning springs only to fall into the springs, Ramna falls into Spring of drowning girl, so when he is splashed with cold water, he turns into a girl, he's dad falls into a Panda version right after. And as the you watch further into the show, you start meeting his rivals / friends have the same curse only with different results.
The first 4 seasons of Ranma are funny as all hell with swapping and crazy suitors/rivals, it gets crazy and strange really quick.
The last season was a bust when viz changed the voice actors and lines that made no sense at all. If that's the worse of it then the Ranma fans got off easy.
It's subbed and dubbed and the colors are there on earlier Blu-ray, it's silly and fun for all (note that in few early episodes Ranma walks around without a top when in female gender due to him still thinking his guy modesty but is put in his place by the girls at the dojo.
It really is over the top fun for all.

6108239,4,B00GSTHCSK,"So, this is obviously the season for remastered video games and anime, because we have a treat! Viz has released Ranma 1/2 Remastered Edition Set 1 on Blu-Ray! The new remastered sets are perhaps my second favorite, with my first being the Robotec 20-disc collection.

Packaging: The set comes in three pieces, the blu-ray discs, a manga sampler and episode summery combo, and the box itself. The box has the creator's touch all over it! You can tell that this is going to be great, with as much care as they've placed into it's release and all.

Remastering: I won't give the standard numbers. It's all pointless, since every film company and their mother is saying the same stuff over and over. Just know that it looks and sounds fantastic! The only real gripe I have with it, is that the japanese to english language conversion for the various signs in the anime is gone. All things considering though, it isn't a huge gripe, not even by my standards. In each set, I've noticed that they are giving some of the episodes a new order, like one episode will now come after another that wasn't in a specific location in the old DVD/VHS videos. I like this touch though, especially since it sounds more true to me.

Repurchase: If I had to repurchase this as a gift for someone, I'd do it! The other sets that I've purchased (set 2) are just like this as well. It's a 7 set series, with four sets being out presently. Go buy your copy today of set 1 or any of the others for that matter.

Manga: As an added bonus, Viz has included a manga sampler of the new remastered Ranma 1/2 manga. If the manga is in the same condition as this, it is worth the money!",1423267200,,1654,4.395424836601308

The visual and sound quality is great, granted it has only one option for Japanese audio and that is with subtitles. That doesn't even bother me that much and I get that since they revamped the series things are going to be slightly different. The voices for the characters are what bother me. I did not expect the voices to be changed. I'm not If anyone else will be bothered by this but I thought it would be helpful to mention it.

6108273,5,B00GSTHCSK,"Ranma 1/2 was the first manga (and later anime) that I fell in love with.  At the time, you'd pay $20-25 for three episodes on a VHS tape.  This Blu-Ray collection is a fantastic re-do in a lot of ways.  The original material has been very well cleaned up, you get a LOT more episodes  (23) for your dollar, and each flows properly with the opening and ending credits and commercial-break animations still kept in their proper place.  This is the first set of the Ranma 1/2 story line and it's worth starting at the beginning, as the characters are probably more shaped in this set than in its successors.

Where we used to have to hunt around to find dubbed videos versus subtitled, this Blu-ray collection will not only do English or Japanese, you can also choose if you want subtitles for just the written words (meaning, signs and such), dialogue, or both.

Since this still isn't enough, you also get a colorful booklet that sums up each episode, includes a thumbnail image of each, and has a right-to-left printed manga of the very first story (called ""Here's Ranma!"" in the book, but repeating the events of ""The Strange Stranger from China"").  I opened this box set and the nostalgia washed over me:  I read the manga for the umpteenth time (I still have my original paperbacks) and then my family spent a fun time on the couch laughing at episode after episode.

If you're new to the series, the concept is simple: teenager Ranma Saotome and his father are part of the ""Anything Goes"" School of Martial Arts.  After an awkward mishap with a cursed water spring, Ranma has an unusual ability:  when splashed with cold water, he turns into a girl...and when hit with hot water, he turns back to a boy.  Unfortunately, Ranma is also betrothed to marry Akane Tendo, whose father runs a dojo of the ""Anything Goes"" style of martial arts--and she's not at all eager to be married to ""a pervert""!

This story is a hilarious situational comedy of martial arts rivalries and young romance, in which random rainshowers or tea-kettles can change the dynamic in a heartbeat.

If you're new to Ranma 1/2 you should begin with Set 1 - it's worth the journey that builds up the story.  This is one of my favorite anime/manga titles of all time and I hope they also release the ""OAV"" feature movies that fit into the storyline too.",1413676800,6,2324,4.5772946859903385

Sad that I have to go to youtube to see the Hot Song Battle, video jukebox and all of the stuff Viz released as VHS extras in the 90s.

I've finished the 4th viewing of the entire series over a period of several years and it's been a lot of fun!

While this is not a problem for most, it is if you speak the Japanese language and want to enjoy the anime without them. It's very distracting, and just because this is Blu-ray doesn't mean we should have hard subs. Really disappointing, since I was replacing my DVD set that was destroyed in a flood. Good that they redid the subtitles all together, as they are better translated, but I honestly just care about the audio and the visuals, not translation.

6108299,5,B00GSTHCSK,"I have been a fan of Ranma 1/2 since the days when I could only find the odd VHS tape in my local movie stores.  Mostly it was the dub, but sometimes I was lucky enough to find a tape in the original Japanese.  Those were very different times for anime fans in America.  Now, 20 years in the future we have the sets that we never could have imagined, but that the series always deserved.

The show has never looked better, and I doubt it is possible to improve on what we have been given.  Not only does it look beautiful and pristine, however, but the masters have not been tampered with.  Gone are the American title cards of the old DVD sets, and they are replaced with the original Japanese shots with soft subtitles.  I may be mistaken, but this set doesn't seem to have a single hard subtitle in it.. and for a fan of animation and the purity of the original material, that is a dream come true.  This is a set that will please both the hardcore anime fans, and the casual viewer who isn't necessarily interested in the minute details.

The extras are nothing to sneeze at as well.  They are very well represented with this set, and a welcome addition for the animation historian.

Finally, the packaging is absolutely gorgeous.  It goes for that strong Chinese theme that is prevalent throughout the series.  It fits and looks great on my shelf.

6108303,5,B00GSTHCSK,"Very very nice set. The blu-ray transfers are beautifully cleaned up, with enhanced colors, and good audio. There are multiple subtitling options to cater to all tastes, and everything is as I remember it. The sets also include a nice book that lists the episodes and gives a summary for each, and includes some samples of the manga. This is the first volume of a planned 7 volume run. The first volume will give you a good idea about whether or not the series is for you or not ;)

Also note, with this set, Viz has FINALLY fixed the order of the episodes so they run in the correct order, and are not out of sequence any more (the most glaringly annoying example of which was that in the old sets they use to run the episodes: ""The Abduction of P-Chan"" and ""Close Call! The Dance of Death... On Ice!"" (the ice skating episodes) AFTER they ran ""Enter Shampoo, the Gung-Ho Girl! I Put My Life in Your Hands"" -- which made NO SENSE, because Akane has a flashback in the Shampoo intro-episodes where she remembers events from the ice skating episodes, that HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET, when they were presented in the wrong order.)

Parental Warning: For those in the United States (and elsewhere) still fiercely clinging to ancient Puritanical vices on nudity (but for some reason are perfectly OK with wanton/graphic violence o_O), you should note that there is a fair amount of female non-sexual nudity in this series, especially in the first season. There is a little bit of sexual nudity in the series as well, but usually just in the form of females trying to entice the main character, and not ""bedroom"" scenes.

6108327,4,B00GSTHCSK,"As a big fan of Rumiko Takahashi's ""Inuyasha"" and ""Mermaid Saga"", I was eager to check out ""Ranma 1/2"" because I have always had a high opinion of her writing, characterization and story-telling. It was not a disappointment! ""Ranma 1/2"" is full of quirky characters and soap-opera-like interrelationships! It's refreshing to see that Takahashi-sensei can handle drama, horror, romance and comedy with such an adept hand! I had never had exposure to ""Ranma 1/2"" before so it was a bit of a dive in for me to purchase a show I had never seen. The blu-ray release looks beautiful! For a show that was begun in the late 80's, the picture quality is fantastic, crisp, sharp and the colors bright! The soundtrack, though just a simple mono (and I only watched it in Japanese), sounds clean and clear. The packaging is quite lovely, truly a perfect design for anyone who may be a die-hard fan of this anime. One thing that struck me is, that while the packaging states that the episodes are in their original Japanese air-date order, this is not true, in fact. There are three episodes smack in the middle of this set that are placed about ten episodes before they actually come in the original episode order. This may bother some of the fans, but then again, I may not know exactly what I'm talking about since this is the first time I'm watching the show. Was ""Ranma 1/2"" a show that I'm glad I purchased? Not in so many words. I don't mind having this set in my collection but I probably won't be purchasing the rest. The entire series is available on Hulu through Viz's Neon Alley and I enjoyed it enough to continue watching that way, though I wish I had tried the series there to begin with. If you're new to ""Ranma1/2"", perhaps try it out before purchasing, but if you're a long-time fan of the show and/or manga, you'll love how beautiful the show looks in this new reissued and remastered set!",1402272000,,1895,4.560117302052786

The punch lines and comedic routines are enhanced for the anime adaptation. The manga chapters are simply too brief to expand for a 24-minute episode. Fortunately, the writers, directors and producers are on their game and succeed in enhancing the humour, rather than make it dull, flat or repetitive.

I enjoyed these 23 episodes so much that I will probably eschew Viz's Big Edition manga and simply continue on with the anime. Anime banzai!

Many of you who are familiar with the original series may recall that when it was first released, immediately after the Rhythmic Gymnastics Battle, there was a preview for the Golden Pair arc. However, the original producers felt it would be two many multi-part arcs in succession, and so they did not air those episodes as part of the first season and instead relegated them to the second season. The consequence of this is that in the first season, there is an awkward moment where Akane has a flashback to an episode that had not yet been shown.

This set restores the Golden Pair arc to its originally intended place between the defeat of Kodachi Kuno and the arrival of Shampoo, so that the flashback scene is no longer anachronistic.

What's more, the video is greatly cleaned up and the original Japanese title cards are now left in place.

The packaging is also slimmer, allowing more room on your shelves than previous collections.

By this point, most anime/manga fans probably know the name 'Rumiko Takahashi.' Maybe not all of those fans appreciate her work on equal terms, but she's prolific in some sense, nonetheless. And one her most popular franchises is that of 'Ranma 1/2' (most people say ""one half,"" but I simply refer to it as ""half"" to save the extra syllable); a rather crazy and over-the-top martial arts romantic action dramedy with the occasional supernatural twist. The series follows one Ranma Saotome, a martial artist who ""befell"" a strange circumstance while training in China with his father, Genma. And during that training, both father and son, literally, fell into the cursed springs of Jusenkyo. The curse was that if you fell into a spring, you'd be transformed into whatever fell in there last (which could be re-activated by cold water and ""deactivated"" with hot water). So upon cold splashes, Ranma now turns into a girl, and his father a panda. Oh, and it just so happens that Genma made a promise long ago with an old friend to marry one of his three daughters to Ranma. Of the three, Akane Tendo was the ""lucky"" gal. Unfortunately, she's a bit of a tomboy, and, well.. sort of hates guys.

It's really hard to describe this series for the uninitiated. Yes, it's as crazy as I make it sound: a protagonist with access to instant (albeit, accidental, unwarranted, and definitely troublesome) sex changes, a giant panda occasionally walking around in public, and an arranged marriage between two people that, for the most part, can't stand each other. And yes, love lines, triangles, rhombuses, pentagrams, and maybe even hexagons (if memory serves me right) will eventually develop, collapse, and redevelop themselves from time to time. If I were to use a more contemporary example of comparison, I would liken Ranma to a martial arts version of The Office: it's kind of irrelevant, sort of meanders, doesn't really have a central story, but has so many quirky characters and hilarious moments, that you can't help but find it entertaining. And bear in mind, this is only the first season. There are more characters to be added or that haven't been mentioned (a rival martial artist guy that turns into a pig, an amazon princess girl that turns into a cat, another guy into a duck, the high school rival that falls for the girl version of Ranma) and various other scenarios to unfold. I won't say much else so I don't spoil things. It really is one of those series that you'll either love or hate (much like Takahashi's other works). If you're not an anime fan and are afraid you won't get some of the humor, please rent or borrow this, first. But if you're obviously well- or even decently-versed, on anime culture, don't hesitate to start collecting this classic.

A perfect score for a TV series from the late '80s/early '90s? Am I being too generous? Nah, I don't think so. Believe it or not (for all you youngsters out there), animation used to be hand-drawn. Yep, before rendered CG or even digital animation, there was a thing called film. And most anime before the turn of the century used to employ such methods as a means of making really cool moving pictures. Movies and OVAs (Original Video Animations) had higher budgets, which meant better film stock. TV series, which could run anywhere from a dozen to a few *hundred* episodes, had their budget constraints, which usually meant lower quality film stock (and possibly shoddy art/animation from time to time). Most anime around this decade were shot on 16mm, maybe 35mm if they had the money for it, but mostly 16mm. Oh yeah, and they also used to format things in 4:3. That's right, kids. TVs used to be squares, not rectangles! And because of that, some of the older stuff you see, today, might not fill your screens, because cutting stuff off, zooming in, and messing with the colors can be considered a slap to the face for people who actually care about the original format. That's what we call ""artistic integrity.""

Yes, unlike the recent ""efforts"" by FUNimation to absolutely screw over Dragon Ball Z and cater to, what I call, the ""McAnime fans"" (the droves of people who unknowingly pay for cheap/bad quality but think they're getting a good product via corporate trickery) who are willing to accept cropping, zooming, de-graining, and over-saturating their pictures, Viz has clearly 1-up'd FUNi by advertising this new Ranma set as *uncropped.* And with that said, the series looks fantastic! My first exposure to the series was over a decade ago on some bootlegged DVDs (although, I think they were copies of the official R1 releases, which I've since gotten rid of, after discovering what bootlegs actually were). If you scroll down, you'll see that I reference Viz uses the same transfer as the Japanese BDs. And from the looks of it, they did a spectacular job with the cleanup and color correction. The film grain makes for excellent line detail, colors look natural and vibrant, and aside from the occasional specking or inherent softness (again, being a long series means a tighter budget, so I'm more than willing to forgive a few specks or animation shortcuts here and there), this will probably be the best picture you can get for a series this old. There's not artificial sharpening, banding (since there aren't any digital effects, obviously), weird saturation issues, or other video snafus that would, otherwise, lead you to believe this is a FUNimation ""remaster.""

Viz presents Ranma 1/2 with two DTS-HD MA tracks, the default being the English dub, with the other being the original Japanese. Also part of the norm for most anime series back in the day (and even sometimes in the present), unless the production itself had a really high budget (like movie or OVA-tiered), then the title in question was usually limited to a simple 2-channel mix (or even mono for the really old or low budget series). Some companies like to take the original sound masters and make faux-5.1 tracks (*cough* FUNimation), but you can only do so much matrixing to make a 2-channel design ""sound like surround."" Fortunately, we get the option to enjoy our preferred language in its most natural 2-channel state. Obviously, its design isn't going to wow any home theater enthusiasts, but it gets the job done and is still better than a hollow/dull lossy stereo or ""lossless faux-5.1"" mix.

As for my personal take on how the mix performs, I think it sounds quite good. Prior to watching this BD set, I had recently been viewing a lot of recorded TV shows with lossy 5.1 (ranging from 384-448kbps), some older anime DVDs with lossy 2.0 (at 192kbps, ugh!), and the occasional blockbuster BD (with lossless 5.1 or 7.1) just for the heck of it. And after mini-marathoning Ranma, I especially find this 2-channel mix to be very good in comparison to the other stuff I was watching (aside form the blockbuster lossless tracks, obviously). Depth between the voices, sound effects, and music separate very well. There's not a whole lot of traffic in the design itself, per se, but it definitely sounds better than the lossy 2-channel mixes most anime DVDs have. There's none of that inherent ringing or hissing, while high and low ends are pretty well-balanced on, both, the left and right speakers. There's even a very slight presence of LFEs (which will vary, depending on your setup), but don't expect something showcase-worthy. Again, it's a very simple 2-channel mix. But for the purpose it serves, that's good enough for me.

An interview with editor Hope Donovan for the newly remastered 2-in-1 omnibus versions of the manga. She talks about how the manga has since gone out of print in the U.S. and how she wanted to fix a lot of the little things with these new re-releases such as: using the original Japanese covers, realigning for the correct reading order (was originally printed in the U.S. reading from left to right, but is now being re-released reading from right to left to retain its ""Japanese-ness"" like all other manga released in the States) more accurate translations (of sound effects and other things), and keeping the artwork as faithful to its original form as possible.

A couple of trailers for InuYasha: one for the BD movie box set and one for the 'Final Act' TV series. This is actually the first time I've seen any of IY in HD, and it looks pretty awesome. Here's hoping they make BD box sets for that series, too.

- 64-Page booklet
Included in the limited edition release is a booklet containing a sample of the remastered manga. I never read the original U.S. prints, but this looks pretty amazing. The paper is glossy, which gives it an especially clean and sturdy look. Not sure if the actual omnibus re-releases will use glossy paper as well, but I think it's a pretty cool thing to have. The manga sample reads in the Japanese order (right to left) and covers about half the booklet. The other half is an episode guide for the anime with screencaps and synopses and reads in Western order (left to right).

- Art box
The BD case and booklet come housed in a spiffy looking artbox with a profile picture of (Girl) Ranma on the front on top of a red background, and (Panda) Genma on the back on top of a blue background. Both profile pictures are embossed with a light gold trim, giving the box a very high quality feel.

Overall - 4.0

It feels like ages since I've seen Ranma. But knowing what I know now, I can say I really missed the series and enjoy it even more, today, especially with this great release by Viz. The extras on disc are a little ho-hum (wish there were more interviews from the Japanese production side, like Takahashi herself or some of the voice actors), but the manga sample is pretty nice, and the art box has a very elegant feel to it. I'm convinced this is as good as the video will ever look sans a 4K master (which would be absolute overkill, in my opinion), so rejoice. Ranma has never looked (or sounded) better. Start (re-)collecting this gem today, and look forward to more Takahashi zaniness (hopefully in the form of InuYasha BDs someday too?)!",1395792000,5,11412,4.761254425897825
6108382,3,B00GSTHCSK,"It's hard for me to review a product like Ranma 1/2 without looking through eyes clouded by nostalgia. The anime is based on the manga of the same name. Created by Rumiko Takahashi (Inu Yasha) Ranma 1/2 is the comical adventures of Ranma, a young man studying martial arts and as a result of an unfortunate training session in China is now cursed to turn into a girl when he gets wet. Obviously this lays the groundwork for wacky misadventures. The series originally aired in the late 80s for several seasons.

Viz's new edition of Ranma 1/2 brings the series to blu ray in North America for the first time. The packaging is absolutely gorgeous. A foil embossed heavy chipboard box houses the blu ray case and companion booklet. The front side features Ranma, the back Genma in his panda form. The Blu-ray Discs have traditional Chinese nature patterns (clouds, waves) and are in a heavy blu ray plastic case. The collectors booklet disappointed slightly. The paper is glossy heavy stock and the episode guide is full color. The booklet can be ""flipped"" to read the first chapter of the manga from the new Ranma manga reisssue. Personally this ruins the book for me. With a property like Ranma I can imagine the majority of people are already aware of the manga and don't need the manga included.

The actual quality of the video is a matter of debate. Ranma 1/2 is an older anime, animated by hand and and as such will not look as crisp as the latest shows coming out of Japan. In the online trailers Viz has advertised that the picture has been remastered to restore the show to its vivid color. Having watched the first disc I can say the colors are gorgeous when compared to previous dvd and VHS releases. However, I felt the picture was still quite grainy but attribute that to the age if the show.

Watching the show for the first time in years I find it still has it's charm. Even the dub which I imagine will be consider atrocious for many is to me a enjoyable just because it takes me back in time to when I first discovered anime.

Overall, Viz has done a beautiful repackage of Ranma 1/2 and this is probably the best presentation of the show available stateside. I'm happy to have this in my collection.",1395792000,5,2215,4.516209476309227
6108383,5,B00GSTHCSK,"I used to watch Ranma 1/2 back in the VHS days and loved it. The show is comedy heavy with some fighting. The main character, Ranma, can switch to the female gender after being splashed with cold water so of course, there are some pervy jokes so I wouldn't recommend it to children. The quality is great considering how old this anime is. In the trailer, the colors seem too bright. This sort of worried me but I bought it anyway. I can say that the trailer is exaggerated and the colors are fine. I was betting the sd/hd version side by side comparison would be exaggerated as it commonly is. The bluray box art is interesting; the gold color on the box is a bit shiny. The booklet inside has a brief synopsis of each episode then a manga of the first 15 min of episode 1. I would recommend this to other Ranma 1/2 fans.",1395792000,,821,4.235668789808917
6108384,5,B00GSTHCSK,"I adore Ranma 1/2. The show was brought to my attention by a school chum back in 1997, and I fell in love with it. By 1999 I was deeply embedded in the fandom: buying shockingly expensive VHS tapes, soundtrack CDs, and even writing fan fiction. Ah, those were good days that make me very nostalgic to think about.

For those who might not be aware of Ranma 1/2, the story is fairly simple, and revolves around 16 year old martial artists Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo. Forced into an arranged engagement by their fathers, Ranma and Akane share a tumultuous relationship from the very beginning, which is further exasperated by a marching line of wacky suitors and lunatic rivals. There's also the small issue of an ancient curse inflicted upon Ranma while visiting a Chinese training ground: when splashed with cold water, Ranma transforms into a girl. Hot water reverses the effect, but only until next time.

And there you have it. That's the show's through-line.

In the early 2000s, Viz Media began releasing season box sets on DVD. They took up an immense amount of shelf space and were wildly expensive. I remember seeing the complete first season at Hastings for nearly $280. Suffice to say, I did not collect the original DVD release. A few years later, Viz re-issued the sets in slim packs with all the same content at significantly reduced prices, but I only managed to snag season 4 and the OAV Series before those DVDs started going out of print.

Over the last five or six years, it slowly became apparent that Ranma's popularity was all but depleted in the United States.  The arrival of shows like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto and InuYasha (another Rumiko Takahashi franchise) pushed it out of the spotlight. The situation wasn't helped by Ranma 1/2's lack of direction in later seasons, or its lack of a satisfying conclusion (a result of the show overtaking the manga). The books, soundtracks and DVDs were all going out of print, and I for one was convinced that Ranma's time to shine had come and gone. I never thought I'd see it back on retailer shelves.

Happily, I was wrong.

In August of 2013, Viz announced that they would be bringing the newly remastered HD transfer of Ranma 1/2 stateside. Set 1 would consist of the first 23 episodes, arranged in the original broadcast order for the very first time. That meant that the weird ""Akane flashes back to something that hasn't happened yet"" moment from the VHS and DVD release would no longer be an issue.

In  December of 2013, Viz released a trailer for the box set that some fans found concerning, and rightly so. While the Japanese transfer is beautiful, Viz's trailer featured heavily saturated colors with red in particular being a major problem. Things like Girl Type Ranma's hair and kung-fu shirt looked extremely burned, wiping out much of the line work and shading that was clearly visible in the original DVD comparison scenes.

I'm happy to report that the trailer was an aberration. A lot of care has gone into this release. The original title cards and episode cards have been restored and the image quality is simply stunning. The aspect ratio has been restored, the characters have actual flesh tones, the shading of backgrounds are rich and vibrant, and while the restoration team seems to have avoided using DNR to try and remove the original 16mm film grain, there's very little in the way of dirt or damage on the print. The whole thing feels alive and in motion even when the images are stationary. This is the best Ranma 1/2 has ever looked.

This release features the original Japanese audio track and Viz's original dub from the 1990s. Quality wise, both tracks sound richer than the original DVD version -- perhaps due to the extra storage space allotted by Blu-ray -- but the dub still has a little more kick than the original Japanese audio, which continues to sound slightly flat in comparison. I have always been a fan of the show's dub, but if you prefer the Japanese original, then you might be interested to know that an all-new subtitle track has been created for the re-release. It's a new translation, although I'm not sure how different it is as I've never watched it subtitled before. As is usually the case with Anime, there is no subtitle track for the English dub. If you're slightly hard of hearing and like to use subtitle tracks to help clarify dialog, be aware that the track will not match the English audio.

For those who prefer the dub but like having subtitles for signs and other on-screen Japanese text, there is a secondary option for just such a track. It's a nice feature, but it makes me sad that the opening and closing themes have been re-translated. I'm assuming that they've done this with the intention of bringing the translation closer to the original Japanese lyrics, but after 16 years of having one set of lyrics stuck in my head, it's a little disconcerting.

There's also a small issue with the re-inserted Japanese title cards. When the show was localized, the names of the episodes were changed. This means that the first episode is now called ""The Strange Stranger from China"", but the spoken dialog continues to call it ""Here's Ranma"". It's a minor issue, but it's one to be aware of.

The packaging for the Limited Edition blu-ray is gorgeous. The art on the blu-ray case itself is identical to the new DVD release, but the outer sleeve is red, gold and blue. The front panel is as you see in the Amazon photo, while the back panel is blue with gold trim and a drawing of Genma as a panda featured at the center. The material from which the sleeve is constructed is extremely sturdy as well. These will be very attractive sets to line up one-by-one once they're all out.

Included within the box is an episode guide/manga preview. It's all glossy and colorful, but otherwise it's really basic. The episode descriptions are brief and to the point.

Special features include pieces shot at New York Comic Con, as well as a ""part 1"" making-of that features Hope Donavan discussing the restoration process for the recently re-released manga series. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but it's more than we ever got on the VHS or DVD releases and the manga restoration feature is interesting for anyone who cares to look behind the curtain. If you're bored, definitely check them out. The set also includes the clean opening and closing title sequences, but the box art warns that the picture quality might not be very good. I haven't checked them out yet, but I've seen someone else mention that they're SD, which is a shame.

So now we come to the question of whether or not these blu-rays are worth picking up if you already own the previously released DVD box sets. In my opinion, definitely. The show has never looked this good, and considering Viz only intends a one-print run of the blu-ray, I'd say paying $50 now is preferable to paying outrageous eBay prices later. If you simply can't afford to pick up the blu-ray now, then take heart: the re-issued DVD is not limited to a single pressing, so you can always pick that up later if you feel so inclined. Even at the lower resolution, I'm sure the remastered quality of the source material would greatly improve the viewing experience of the original DVDs.

If you've never before experienced Ranma 1/2, give it a shot. It's a classic Anime that is near and dear to many hearts (including the fine folks at Viz). They've taken a financial risk with the decision to re-release an older, lesser known series. Show your support of classic anime and pick it up, stat!",1395705600,81,7559,4.6877828054298645

This thing is amazing. Probably one of the nicest designs I've ever seen on a Premium chipboard set.  The artwork is great, the colors pop, and nothing about it feels cheap at all. It comes with this really nice episode guide/manga sampler with strong, glossy pages.  The set features 23 episodes over the course of 3 Blu-ray discs, which brings me to the real reason I wrote this review.

THE AMARAY CASE HOLDING THE BLU-RAYS SMELLS GOOD. Really good.

As soon as you open that sucker you get a whiff of some of the finest smelling blu-rays ever to hit the market. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe only mine smells good.  All I know is that the smell alone is enough to warrant a 5-star rating. It's also worth mentioning that this isn't one of those crummy eco-cases with holes just large enough for your fingers to jab through the cover-art while opening it (*cough* Sentai).

Anyways, this is a great series and this set has some of the best packaging I've ever seen on an anime release.",1395532800,16,1104,4.49

8626891,5,B00GSTHCSK,"I've long loved the Ranma 1/2 TV show.  I have some of it on Japanese LDs, got the series as DVDs, and then bought this one the other day, when I found out it existed (not sure how I didn't find it sooner).  Don't be massively over-sold; Blu-ray is, at best, a minor improvement on DVD for hand-drawn animation like this, in general.  This one is a significant step up, however, because the DVDs were made when DVDs were first released, and the mastering was not good.  These, however, with years of experience to draw on, are flawless.  Very happy with it.",1517356800,,557,4.421568627450981
8626892,4,B00GSTHCSK,"I'm not going to discuss the content of Ranma.  It's the same Rumiko martial arts romantic comedy it was back when it was first aired.  If you don't know what Ranma is check out other reviews for more information about that.  Instead I want to discuss technical aspects of this remastered HD Bluray release.

I'll start with a  helpful hint.  The default is to NOT display subtitles for Japanese signs and writing that appear onscreen.  So unless you can read Japanese, or have a pathological hatred for subtitles, you'll want to go into Setup and make sure to select ""English Audio with SIGNS & SONGS Subtitles"".  Also helps if you want to know what the lyrics for the opening and ending songs mean in English :)  And one additional side note, these song lyrics look like accurate translations, not the sing-a-longable lyrics Viz used to put in their videos.  Not sure why they made the switch.  You can find the sing-a-longable lyrics posted in places on the internet if you're interested, like furinkan.com.

Ranma first aired on TV in Japan in 1987, so this marks the 30th anniversary of the TV series.  Ranma predates modern-day digital production so the originals are all sitting in some warehouse on analog media of some sort.  And nothing lasts forever.  This much is apparent as soon as the theme song starts up.

While not as noticeable when there's motion on screen, every still shot looks noisy as hell.  I had to turn up my TV's noise filter all the way to make it watchable.  Not sure why they didn't run a noise filter over this as they were remastering it.  It's a simple process and would smooth out the appearance of the resulting show dramatically.  There's no reason to uprez something to 1080P when all we're getting out of it is additional static.  This might actually look better if it was just displayed at the original 480 resolution, then the blurriness would tend to even out a lot of the noise.  It's possible this looks better when using a different system setup.  I'm using a PS4 displaying to a Panasonic Plasma TV through HDMI.  I'd be interested in hearing if others noticed similar noisiness.

The other thing annoying me is the frame tends to move about horizontally (and I think a little vertically too sometimes).  This isn't noticeable in a lot of shots, but it stood out to me early on in the scenes were Ranma and Genma are fighting each other while running down the street.  It's funny cause it looks like gate weave, which is a problem you would expect to see with film, but at no point would that apply to a video production aired on TV.  It's possible to clean that up with a motion filter, if Viz had so chosen to do, but this can also cause a loss of smoothness on moving objects or when the camera pans.

I decided to dig up an old VHS tape I had of Ranma to see if this gate weave happened back in the 90's.  Though the quality of the tape was pretty degraded after so many years (and a probably less-than-ideal storage environment) it did appear that the ""gate weave"" effect was present back then.  It's MUCH harder to notice this when watched in 480i and I wouldn't have seen it if I wasn't watching for it.  But on Bluray in 1080p on a big screen TV, it magnifies problems like this.  So I think my verdict (based on my limited sample size of 1) is this problem looks original, at least dating to the Viz Video VHS tapes, and is preserved and made much more apparent on these HD episodes.

I'll include a couple of pictures showing the noise problem in detail.  Keep in mind the horizontal banding and possible moire pattern are artifacts from taking a picture of a TV screen.  All these show you is that an area that should be a solid color or white end up looking speckled.",1516492800,,3726,4.484398216939079
8626893,5,B00GSTHCSK,This is a comedy about a boy and his father who fell in a cursed hot spring and now when wet they turn into a woman and a panda respectively. There is a lot of humor around the boy being hit on by other guys while he is in female form. Its a great laugh for sure.,1510012800,,263,3.6315789473684212
8626894,1,B00GSTHCSK,"So, beyond how just generally really bad this show is (very poor voice acting/dubbing), there's a scene when an older male forces himself upon a younger girl (that's how he sees Ranma, but it's wrong no matter the gender of course!)  He grabs her, and she clearly does not like the contact and THEN he kisses her, holding her to him so she can't turn away.  Then, someone tells Ranma that ""ITS YOUR FAULT"" [that he forced it on him].  BLAMING A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT!!!!  I'm not one to overreact to these things but it's MESSED UP!!!!  Ranma is told this multiple times.  This is NOT OK.",1502755200,,591,4.425925925925926
