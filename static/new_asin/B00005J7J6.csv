7938571,5,B00005J7J6,I got this some time back on amazon on the all pal dvd version form a russian distribution sold in the u. s. at marina books in New york. It had the original language and you can shut off poor russian dubbing and subtitles by guessing what each word means i did. It was an excellent story of adventure and romance Marika works for her fathers hotel as a dancer and singer .She gets in trouble by going through a traffic signal. Look closely at the teacher marika has to go to. Do you knotice whats he's wearing ? Yes you guess it a nazi uniformbut it's the only one you see it. She ends up falling for viktor skaal whome she thinks is a prince . It's highly entertaining,1233964800,,670,4.161538461538462
