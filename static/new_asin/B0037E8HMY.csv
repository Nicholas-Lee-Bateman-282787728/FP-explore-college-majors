4081164,5,B0037E8HMY,"""Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story"" is a fascinating documentary about the political life of the Republican. The film focuses on Lee Atwater and the tactics he used as a Republican political operative. He was a consultant to 3 presidents and served as the 1988 campaign manager for George Bush.

Atwater's most notorious act as a political consultant include an ad he used against Michael Dukakis that Atwater continuously denied having any part of.

The documentary also delves into Atwater's life as a musician and entertainer. He played the guitar in a blues band and is described in the film as having so much soul, he was really a ""black person in a white body"".

Interviews in the documentary include ones with Tom DeLay, Tucker Eskew, Sam Donaldson and Michael Dukakis, to name a few. The film also includes footage of George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Karl Rove.

""Boogie Man"" is a great lens into the world of Lee Atwater and really dives right into the backstabbing, corruption, controversy and success of his political career.",1268179200,6,1040,4.858757062146893
4081165,5,B0037E8HMY,"This documentary provided insight into Lee Atwater's concept of what I call ""melanin theory"" (my own terminology). Atwater's effort of using silent and coded racism to impact presidential elections proves my theory. Atwater's concept is still used today. Interesting enough; Nixon began using the ""melanin  theory"" by introducing ""the war on drugs"", which continued through six presidents. Ronald Reagan's ""black welfare mothers"" and ""war on drugs. Bush Sr.'s ""war on criminals"". Bill Clinton's ""war on crime"". All of these campaigns used African Americans as the face of the war on drugs, war on criminals and war on crime. We see Atwater's concept in Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's campaign. We also see talking points of each of the previous presidential campaigns used currently; including new ones like black lives matter, black on black on crime, and black suffering under Obama. The melanin theory is using false narratives about African American to win an election no matter how untrue. All of the campaigns against African Americans were proved untrue by whistle blowers. They created the narratives to dehumanize a group of people. Running a campaign using  silent, coded racism, and benign neglect (Nixon years) is  the catalyst to winning any election. My granny used to say actions speak louder than words. The interesting fact is America really does despise African Americans. As we see the current climate in America. Racism whether coded or blatant exposes  racist people as bullies who lack character; trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and true citizenship. Atwater suffered in the end and asked for forgiveness. The question is what is the impact on humanity when people lie, steal, kill, and cheat other humans? Does everyone not deserve a fair chance? Does Atwater deserve forgiveness? Dancing, singing, and hanging out with African American while stirring up people who despise them; does not warrant forgiveness. RIP Atwater.",1475020800,,1977,5.409090909090909
4081166,5,B0037E8HMY,"Great documentary on the man who destroyed an entire political party as well as political discourse. No, Karl Rove isn't the 'American Machiavelli' that title belongs to his mentor, Lee Atwater. It is amazing to me that a man could live his entire life devoid of morals and on his death bed confess his 'sins' and expect all to be well. The damage was already done. Atwater got the republican party addicted to scorched earth campaigning, which became scorched earth governing. He created the need in republican party to get rid of Fairness Doctrine which paved the way for hate radio and the Fox propaganda channel. Lee Atwater more than any other recent figure is responsible for the horrible state of political discourse in this country.",1473638400,,740,4.880952380952381

Even Atwater's insights and his successes were always loaded with negative motives or qualifiers.  Is it really true that Atwater did nothing positive, or did nothing for a good motive?  Just be aware that this is a Democrat party view of Atwater, so if that's your thing, you'll love this documentary.  (Well, Mary Matalin was the lone voice who was positive...so you know it's pretty weak tea when she's the token positive Republican.)",1469404800,,544,4.891304347826087

This documentary is a lesson to everyone that you absolutely reap what you sow...what goes around comes back around.  Many times you don't get to see it but in Lee Atwaters case the things he did were so horrible that it came back to him in the most horrible way.

4081193,5,B0037E8HMY,"Lee Atwater was certainly a pioneer in the dark arts of political campaigning, using the media to spread negative information (even if false) and attacking candidates on a personal level. However, he was not alone, and was more a product of the times. He could not be near as influential if there was not already a serious coarsening of the political discourse with the rise of radical political rightwing christianity combined with free market fundamentalism.

The best part of the documentary is a Bush operative explaining that liberals think Republicans are so stupid for voting against their own economic interests but what the liberal doesn't understand is that they ""voting their patriotism."" Indeed..",1375056000,,708,5.265486725663717
4081194,1,B0037E8HMY,"This documentary just rubbed me the wrong way. Lee Atwater was definitely a political dirt bag.

I pray that the hatred, fight for power, fame, and fortune is removed from our communities to allow us to be caring and concerned people. To love one another and learn how to be more caring, sustainable living, and Godly people. PS please watch the movie again to hear how the Bible was still in cellophane and Atwater never read it just continued to use it for his own publicity. Let us pray that he is where he is suppose to be in the fire of those who chose a life of evil. PS let us focus on the same justice happening to D. Rove as it did in the last days and times for Atwater.",1373155200,2,840,4.159509202453988

4081200,5,B0037E8HMY,"Lee Atwater was a political.operative as seduced by his fame, as he was his scorched candidate offense. To destroy the opposition... to create so much damage to their reputation and ability to be campaign, he shifted the election dynamic from issues and platform to character destruction and hysteria. It worked. But st whey cost?
Today,divisive politics -- based on fear, misinformation, bias -- distracts the conversation from what matters; it has taken distraction and made it the way of candidacy. Sadly, its also permeated what is now fear based journalism, as well.
In many ways,  it all trickles back to this man -- and ""Willie Horton."" Tragic misrepresentation,  and yet the template for modern campaigning was set into motion.

4081201,4,B0037E8HMY,This docu shines a light on political strategies of the late 80s early 90s.  Lee was something of an enigma.,1367798400,,108,4.4
4081202,4,B0037E8HMY,"The 2008 documentary BOOGIE MAN: THE LEE ATWATER STORY covers the meteoric rise of the late political hit man Lee Atwater.  According to this film, Lee Atwater's favorite sport was professional wrestling because everyone knows it's fake but still gets into it as if it isn't, which was Atwater's view of politics.  We don't find out if Atwater gave a second thought to political opponents and their families when he smeared them with his malicious campaign tactics, just as pro wrestlers still get hurt performing staged fights.

Of course, clients such as George Poppy Bush deserve as much if not greater condemnation for allowing Atwater to spread lies about Michael and Kitty Dukakis, and other political rivals.  Seeing Atwater dying of a brain tumor at age 40 in BOOGIE MAN, one could say the devastation he caused others came right back at him, but realize Poppy Bush is alive and kicking at age 88 as I write this in January 2013.  The corporate news media should also bear responsibility for the damage Atwater did to innocent people by reporting and repeating his lies without question, BOOGIE MAN reminds us.

Until you remember the man had three young children when he died, it's easy to appreciate how he is all but invisible when BOOGIE MAN shows a wheelchair-bound, very sick Lee Atwater at a gathering of Republican power brokers not long before death.  Just a year earlier, Atwater would have been the center of attention in that room.

BOOGIE MAN, made during the administration of George W. Bush, suggests Atwater deserves some of the credit for Republicans being the choice of American voters in five out of seven presidential elections, 1980 through 2004.  But one should consider that after Poppy Bush's 1988 victory Democrats have won every White House vote, keeping George W. Bush's theft of the 2000 and 2004 elections in mind.  The real legacy of the twelve years of Ronald Reagan (another Atwater employer) and Poppy Bush - and thus Lee Atwater - were the appointments of corrupt Supreme Court justices who installed George W. Bush as president in 2000 and ruled corporations are people in the Citizens United case.

4081203,5,B0037E8HMY,"A fascinating documentary !!! Lee Atwater revolutionized presidential campaigning. He helped to create a solid Republican south. And he became notorious for turning national politics back into a blood sport, not only using nasty attacks but reveling in his image as the bad boy of Washington. Then, at the age of 39, Atwater was struck by a brain tumor. In thirteen months, cancer ended the most controversial career in modern politicsthe charismatic, colorful, and contradictory life of Lee Atwater. Even today Atwater is a fallen leader Republicans love and a rival Democrats love to hate. He was the first political handler as mediagenic as his candidatescertainly the first chairman of the Republican National Committee to record a blues album. His campaigns represent the high-water mark of the GOPs postwar dominance of the presidency, and his techniques set the tone for races across the country. Watching Washington since his death, politicians and pundits still wonder, What if Lee Atwater had lived?Bad Boy reveals how Lee Atwater began his career controlling crowds as jittery class clown, traumatized by the agonizing death of his little brother. In college he discovered the subtle intercourse of policy and public opinion and grew from party animal to party man. Bad Boy details Atwater's political strategies from the grass roots to the national level. Even more ruthless were the behind-the-scenes power games as he crossed paths, and occasionally crossed swords, with nearly every major Republican of the 1980s: Reagan, Bush, Baker, Ailes, Rollins, and many more. In Bad Boy, we also see the faces Atwater tried to spin away. He was a compulsive womanizer, climbing through windows to avoid reporters. He played radical politics but promoted ""big tent"" Republicanism. Even his last public moment is controversial. Did Atwater's deathbed words really repudiate entire campaigns, or were they twisted by political enemies and second-hand reporting? Was his repentance sincere or simply one last gasp of press manipulation? Was he responsible for the infamous Willie Horton ads, or was he unfairly blamed by 1988s losers, trying for a moral victory? Is Lee Atwater, a master of spin, now being spun in his grave?In its sudden end, Atwater's remarkable life resembled the rise and fall of a fine political novel. With the probing insights of an expert interviewer and a rare stylistic verve, John Brady tells that whole frantic, fascinating storythe life of the baddest boy in D.C.",1356998400,2,2494,5.268844221105527

Lee Atwater, known as ""the boogie man"" for his guitar playing and perhaps, his formidable political skills, is the predecessor to kingpins like Karl Rove.  Without giving away the
story and biography of this influencial figure, the viewer will be treated to skillfully produced documentary
that exposes the seamy side of campaign public relations.  Some may hear the word ""documentary"" and think ""boring"",
but I must stress:  this is as important and entertaining a film I have ever watched. If you like the intrigue of
politics and are amazed by the sociopathy that goes with it, then this one will be high on your hit list.  If you are simply interested in being entertained and gaining insight into the nitty gritty of national politics, then this is a must watch for every citizen of the US.  From success to personal tragedy, Lee Atwater personifies the American Dream twisted by the cynicism of politics.  Before his death of cancer, he wrote a book essentially
apologizing to the American people for motivating them to votre against their own best interest.  Was he really repenting?  Judge for yourself.",1352505600,17,1265,4.957345971563981

It brings up the conundrum of how can we respect our leaders when they pay men and women to use every dirty trick to win them office? ""Everyone does it!"" you hear, and, sadly, there is strong evidence to support that.

I'm like the little girl in Colorado, crying because she's tired of ""Bronco Bama and Mitt Romney"". Making children cry by endlessly demonizing the opposition: I think that's Lee Atwater's contribution to modern presidential politics. I'm actually kind of serious about that. Neither side is pure. One side will win a Pyrrhic victory on November 6th. Will we respect the winner?

That said, I do recommend this look at Presidential politics. If you can stomach any more of it this soon after the current campaign, I salute you. If you agree this is how we should elect our presidents, senators, congressmen, and state officials, I suggest you look into the black recesses of your heart for what's left of your soul.",1351814400,2,1099,4.840425531914893

Then again, I wonder sometimes why the "" artistic crowd"" is so relentlesly drawn to portray the politicians like Stalin, Marx, Castro, Chavev, etc, in a positive light, when those people would jail or kill them for any misstep, whereas those they always rally against are their strongest allies in freedom of expression.

This film is very important because it helps people get behind the scenes just a little bit into how politics really works.  Especially for people who have just enough familiarity with campaigns to understand the basic game, this will take you to another level.  It's very well researched and produced and covers a part of life we really need to understand better.

The whole Dukakis bit is a little sappy.  They make Dukakis out to be a kind of hero or tragic figure rather than just a guy who lost a political campaign.  Which is part of what misfires about this documentary.  The ""dirty tricks"" are not just a Republican game, they are a universal political game, which is played by those who make into the oval office.  It makes the documentary a bit self-spoofing.  Some feel the need to find a boogieman to explain Republican election victories, rather than think some people might actually hold Republican convictions.  Atwater fills this role, and the torch gets passed to disciple Karl Rove.  Actually politics is a form of bloodless war and it's best practitioners on both sides know how to play it.  Ask David Axelrod.

The morality tale does work in the end however.  Atwater played bloodsport, it caught up with him, and in the end he finds his soul.  There is a lesson there for those who want in on both sides of the game.",1315440000,5,1489,4.608365019011407

4081212,5,B0037E8HMY,"Nietzsche writes that, ""he who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster."" In ""Boogieman: The Lee Atwater Story,"" director Stefan Forbes casts contemporary American politics as horror show, giving his subject a treatment usually reserved for the deadly-but-perhaps-misunderstood stars of cult cinema.

Forbes makes it clear that he views Atwater, the political operative responsible for attack ads that George Bush used to defeat Michael Dukakis in 1988, as a destructive force. He highlights Atwater's eager manipulation of bigotry and resentment, his beatification of the big lie, but also takes pains to point out deeper insecurities and endearing quirks. Atwater loved cult films, did splits while playing blues guitar, doused his food with hot sauce, and capped off his lean and hungry look with a sly smile suggesting that you, too, might be in on the joke. We're compelled to celebrate Atwater's ascent to the top of the nation's political class in much the same way that it might cheer King Kong's victory over Godzilla, to thrill in his excesses even as we are appalled by them.

Forbes exploits a trade secret of political historians: the audience loves a protagonist who toes the line and gets away with it, like Lyndon Johnson holding court for reporters while sitting on the toilet. But, he shows that Atwater understood something essential about the transgressive core of American politics and that his understanding won elections. The question posed, then, is whether monstrosity is a pre-requisite, the cost of victory one's own humanity.",1278374400,5,1593,5.21875
4081213,5,B0037E8HMY,"""Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story"" is one of the most interesting
political documentaries around. The film focuses on Lee Atwater, a man who
served as a consultant to three presidents and was also the campaign
manager for George Bush.

While Atwater is most well known for an ad that he denied having any part
of, this documentary delves deeper into his personal life. In this film,
we see Atwater as a musician and entertainer.  Interviews from individuals
such as Tom DeLay, Sam Donaldson and Michael Dukakis help to paint a more
colorful picture of who Atwater is outside of politics. The film is
extremely interesting in that it manages both to highlight his extreme
love for music and expose his controversial political career at the same

Was Lee Atwater a loved or hated man?  Boogie Man offers a deeper look into the compelling lives

4081214,5,B0037E8HMY,"""Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story"" is a fascinating documentary that chronicles the political life of Republican consultant, Lee Atwater. It isn't your average political documentary, because it also goes into Atwater's more personal life, like his interest in Blues music, and the fact that he was in a Blues band for a few years during his career. The film also delves deep into the corruption and scandal that occurred as a result of Atwater's consulting and campaigns.

All in all, it's an entertaining documentary about a very complex political figure. It's filled with scandal, corruption, some music, and the sad end to Atwater's life, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in watching a great film about an interesting politician.",1272326400,4,746,5.114754098360656

Exposes the subtle way GOP politicos use racism, sexism, and so-called 'culture issues' to cause Americans to vote against their economic interests. Lee Atwater was a harbinger of the Trump era, which hopefully will soon come to an end.",1477958400,,339,5.296296296296297
