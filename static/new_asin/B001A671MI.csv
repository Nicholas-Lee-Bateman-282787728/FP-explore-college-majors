Like having the tv on in the background? Pop one of these in and redeem some of the time that the tube is on! Volumes nine and up have improved cinematography and the lyrics are integrated with a pleasing artistic flair.  Best of all they are an unbeatable resource for small group ministry. I am passionate about small groups and believe they should be a model of what happens in corporate worship. That said, setting aside time in your meetings for worship is essential. It invites the Spirit to come and minister and helps posture our hearts to glorify God and grow in our love for Jesus Christ. 10 Stars for these valuable DVD's!",1236988800,12,786,4.574468085106383

8276237,4,B001A671MI,"Great music DVD with high quality audio and graphic backgrounds. My only complaint is that you can't selectively create a playlist, but there is a menu to select individual songs or to play all in sequence.",1382832000,,206,4.75

8276239,5,B001A671MI,We love listening to the songs on the iworship DVD's.  Sometimes we sit and watch it and other times we just use it as a wonderful background of music for the day.  Buy this and you won't be disappointed!,1304899200,,204,4.205128205128205
8276240,2,B001A671MI,"I just realized that integrity has come out with newer volumes!!! EXCELLENT, but......... I have volumes 1-7 and was greatly disappointed to find that all the songs on volume 9 are on the previous volumes except for 3 new songs!!! Are you kidding me....................what's the point of producing a new volume if only 3 out of the 14 songs are new? Maybe new graphics??? I already have 11 of the songs on the previous 7 volumes, why would I pay $15 for 3 songs?!?! I'm very sad about this volume 9!!!

However, if you don't have the previous volumes, you might like to buy this one if it has all the songs you like. Overall, the iWorship @ home volumes are EXCELLENT!!!! I love them and use them all the time!!!! But volume 9 is pretty useless for me because I already have 11 of the songs on the previous vols.(except for 3 songs that I don't have) and will not pay $15 for just 3 songs!!!

From my research, and according to the previous review that includes the song list, the only new songs you get are #5 - Hosanna (but it's on vol. 7 with a different singer - same as the other version down the list on volume 9) #7 and #12.",1250812800,15,1132,4.26046511627907
8276241,5,B001A671MI,"The iworship @home DVD series is such a nice way to have an intimate worship experience at home. The videos are well done to show the lyrics on screen as the music plays. Sometimes I enjoy having it on in the background, at other times I like to actively worship with the DVD.
There are a couple tracks where there is a tiny bit too much movement with the text and it can be slightly distracting, but overall I still really like this DVD.

The track listing is as follows:
1. Here I Am To Worship (Tim Hughes)
2. Blessed Be Your Name (Beth Redman & Matt Redman)
3. Trading My Sorrows (Darrell Evans)
4. Praise Adonai (Paul Baloche)
5. Hosanna (Brooke Fraser)
6. Majestic (Lincoln Brewster)
7. Saviour King (Mia Fields and Marty Sampson)
8. How Great Is Our God (Ed Cash, Jesse Reves, Chris Tomlin)
9. Above All (Paul Baloche, Lenny LeBlanc)
10. In Christ Alone (Stuart Townsend, Keith Getty, Edward Mote)
11. Before The Throne Of God Above (Charitie Bancroft, Vikki Cook)
12. Our God Saves (Paul Baloche, Brenton Brown)
13. Hosanna (Paul Baloche, Brenton Brown)
14. Come Thou Fount, Come Thou King (Robert Robinson, Thomas Miller)",1242000000,42,1130,4.65
