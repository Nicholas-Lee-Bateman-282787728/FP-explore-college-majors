6798459,2,B00PGDA8P8,"Wife and I both like Tim Hawkins a lot.  We've seen most of his DVD's and You Tube videos and have even seen him live;  we've always enjoyed his performances.  Until this time.  In this show his ""patter"" was filled with long blank spaces and pauses which really broke up his delivery and made it difficult for him to be as humorous as he usually is; he seemed unusually hesitant and unsure of himself.  Even the jokes and skits he did do were not up to his usual standard (although the ""That's the Worst"" skit was hysterical.)  About half way through my wife and I looked at each other and agreed that he just wasn't funny this time.  Hopefully he'll get his ""mojo"" back and go back to his usual hilarious self, but he missed the ball this time.  I'd skip this one.",1433203200,6,765,4.300699300699301

However, this latest video is probably his ""worst.""

We love watching him, but a lot of this production just wasn't funny. I can recall maybe half a dozen funny moments. (The son and his body fat was my favorite).

Doesn't change the fact I'll always be a Tim Hawkins fan. Look forward to seeing him again soon.",1432944000,4,456,4.604938271604938

While I thought it started a little slow, there were later moments where I was laughing so hard I was gasping for oxygen. The creative lyrics and guitar journey with a looper pedal also held up the usual top notch musical portion of the show. Watched with family and all were laughing (even the teens).",1420156800,,382,4.536231884057971

6798550,3,B00PGDA8P8,"We love Tim Hawkins and have seen almost every video he has made in addition to seeing him live in concert.  The man is FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY and very talented.  This CD is probably one of his funniest EVER.  My family laughed so hard that we cried.

So why only 3 stars?  Well...it seems as of late that Tim is resorting to toilet humor.  Now...an occasional ""fart"" joke isn't offensive to me or my family, but when a comedian goes on and on and on with the fart jokes...well, it gets old fast.

I look at toilet humor in comedy like I look at swear words in comedy routines....if you have to resort to potty humor and/or swear words, that probably means you're running out of truly funny material.

And lastly...some of Tim's jokes through out the years cross over into being disrespectful of our Lord.  Like some of his other CDs, there are times on That's The Worst that Tim's jokes involving the Lord left our family feeling very uncomfortable.  I wish he would be more careful when he is talking about our Savior who should be treated Holy and with honor.",1420070400,46,1059,4.4404145077720205
