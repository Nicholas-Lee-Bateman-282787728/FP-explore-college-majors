3905470,5,B002CA68GG,"This documentary exposes the dirty secret of factory farming. Factory farming without regulations is an environmental nightmare. It's not gotten the exposure that MTR has gotten. It's hard to hide a mountain whose top has been blown off but 30,000 birds in a huge nondescript aluminum building and a tractor spreading  'waste' across the land is easily missed.  Back in 1995, one of the worst environmental disasters in our nation occurred when an 8 acre hog-waste lagoon in North Carolina broke and spilled 25 million tons of manure into the New River-ttwice the size of Exxon-Valdez! It was the worst environmental disaster until the BP spill.

These farms are threatening our health in other ways too. We are becoming antibiotic resistant and most of the blame has been placed on the medical community with little or no responsibility being put on the meat industry. The FACT is 70% of our antibiotics are being used on animals not humans! Because of antibiotic resistance, doctors are being forced to prescribe stronger antibiotics with dangerous side effects. This is only one way that factory farming is dangerous to our health.

The bottom line is vote with your fork. Vote at the ballot box. Educate others. Buy this video.",1328400000,3,1231,4.990243902439024
3905471,1,B002CA68GG,"This film did a good job at offering one point of view on the subject. It is too one-sided to be taken seriously.

The images chosen and music that accompanies them clearly display the film maker's bias. Horror music is played as stock footage of a select few farms in America are shown. On the other hand, happy images of Europeans bicycling in the streets are used to display a nanny state offered as ""more advanced"" than our own.

This documentary is irresponsible. Facts are given, but they are never put into context. The film does not consider the benefits of large-scale farming. Economics are not even addressed.",1320364800,4,620,4.731481481481482

3905473,5,B002CA68GG,"""Whiskey is for Drinkin'
Water is for Fightin'""
  -Mark Twain

Water, or more precisely the lack thereof, is increasingly gaining the attention of the world's political leaders, policy planners, scholars and press. Indeed, many experts believe the situation is so acute it has moved from one of concern to that of crisis and that such scarcity will be the catalyst for World War III.

In the U.S. the issue of water scarcity is beginning to be viewed as something other than a local problem readily solved by technology. It is a major issue for communities such as Las Vegas and Los Angeles and in Oklahoma, one time home to the director of this documentary, numerous communities are facing water shortages and the state is conducting a long term study of the problem. It is also embroiled in a long running legal battle against major, nationally recognized employers, primarily in the poultry industry. The issue is the contamination of lakes, streams, and rivers primarily in the eastern part of the state and the ill effects it is having not only on the surface water so vital to the state but also the adverse impact it is having on human health. The run off from poultry factory farms in the form of animal waste and fertilizers is a public health issue as well as a depletion of what the world is now recognizing as a finite resource, clean water.

This film is a must have for anyone remotely interested in or concerned about the impact poultry factory farms is having on not only Oklahoma's water sources and human health but world wide. The director traveled throughout the world interviewing scientific experts, politicians, and concerned citizens in an effort to see how the problem had been dealt with in other venues and what could be done in the U.S. His findings will make you angry and hopeful, in equal parts. You will become angry after viewing the aerial photo's of obvious pollution from run off into one of Oklahoma's premier lakes near poultry factory farms. You will become madder when viewing the interview with the parents of a child, one of many it turns out in a small poultry farming community, that has been stricken with cancer and there is evidence the company was aware of the dangers.
You will become hopeful when hearing the scientific experts describe how such problems can be eliminated through sustainable, available, safe agriculture practices and that there are a few elected officials willing to risk their political future by challenging these corporate farmers that hide behind the mantra of economic development every time they are brought to task about pollution that is traced back to their operations.
These problems and issues are not new and surprisingly neither are the solutions. They have been dealt with in numerous countries throughout the world and even in some U.S. areas. What is new is the challenge to the poultry industry by an increasing number of states and ordinary citizens.
This is a must see film for anyone concerned about public health, the current and growing water crisis, and the question of when is enough... enough? Lack of safe drinking water knows no political party and dealing with cancer and other public health problems related to poultry farming and the apparent lack of corporate responsibility affects everyone. With the availability of this well researched, easily understandable, fairly price film there is no reason for someone to say ""I didn't realize this was happening."" Get this film and you be the judge before its to late.",1247788800,9,3512,4.905723905723906

8363730,3,B002CA68GG,"I purchased this DVD because I am interested in environmental issues, and I thought this might be a good topic (and film) to present to college students for discussion.

It's really a ""talking heads"" film, where experts or victims discuss various issues, from the use (certainly overuse) of antibiotics in confined livestock operations, to issues regarding dust and odors, animal welfare, heavy metals, ammonia (an issue where I live), and other significant topics.

This DVD failed to meet my expectations in 3 areas:

1.  The power of visual representation.  As a film, there was way too much ""footage"" giving to listening to people talk, and not near enough time given to visual depictions of livestock and livestock waste.  I recognize that producers don't encourage filmmakers to come and film their operations (in some states, this is now illegal), but the final format of ""A River of Waste: The Hazardous Truth About Factory Farms"" was, well, boring.  It's an important topic.  Make it seem important!  I've watched many farming-related films, and this one will put students to sleep.

2.  The German-US livestock production system comparison was weak.  Are there NO high quality livestock production operations in the US to compare with the low quality (aka dangerous) operations?

3.  Most examples dealt with chicken production, but I had assumed it would cover a broader range of animal production systems (there is a pig on the cover of the DVD).  I guess I would have rather had cattle, pigs, and chickens (and eggs) discussed in equal parts throughout, or have the DVD focus exclusively on one.

I probably won't be using this in the classroom.  Shame.  As I said, it is an important topic for discussion.",1413849600,2,1719,5.014134275618375

8363733,5,B002CA68GG,"A River of Waste is one of the best documentaries I've seen on the subject. Where as one reviewer tried to claim it was biased he wasn't able to point out a single error. When the truth is this ugly some people would rather turn away and pretend it doesn't exist. One myth we need to put to bed is that this is done for our own good to make food cheaper. This is purely about maximizing profits. Look at it this way. Pick a good traditional breed of chicken and put a hen and a rooster in a field together and forget about them. Just make sure they are protected from predators and have adequate water as in a stream. Come back in a few years and you have a field of chickens. Where's the expense? They evolved to reproduce and raise their own young. Where the factory comes in is you don't want to raise 10 or a 100 on that acre field but a 100,000. They lock farmers into contracts where they aren't allowed a profit because any profit the farmer makes is profit the corporation doesn't make. Corporations are inherently evil because they have only one concern, profits. They aren't driven by moral concerns so they are no different than sociopaths. Sociopaths only care about their own interests and have no emotional reaction to the harm they do others, very much like corporations. It's why corporations defend the pollution they cause and the low wages they pay. Both are good things because they make the corporations money!",1360195200,2,1431,4.486590038314176
8363734,5,B002CA68GG,"Everyone should see ""A River of Waste: The Hazardous Truth About Factory Farms.""

Factory farms are destroying the environment and endangering our health. Many of the factory farm practices used in the United States have been banned in the rest of the world but they are still in use here because the giant corporations pay off the politicians and use ""lobbyists"" to avoid taking responsibility for the damage they create.

When it comes to factory farming, you are either supporting the system by purchasing their products or you are against the system by boycotting their products.
