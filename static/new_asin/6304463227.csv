A little bit on the history of Soviet and Russian military aviation, the differences in training and thinking between the West and the Russians, Soviet military aircraft development, interview with current Russian pilots and lots of good footage specially on the Su-27. An American pilot/writer rides the SU-27 and comments on the Su-27, an IT guy from California pays to ride a Russian jet fighter and also included is the ejection of the Mig 29 crash at the Paris air show in 1989. The picture is what one would expect from a 1996 production, the narration is good and informative and sound is good.
