8125354,1,B000FOT9LW,"This DVD just proves the total arrogance of this man. He's spoiled rotten and he doesn't try to hide it. He and ""Crocodile Camilla"" deserve each other",1348444800,,150,4.592592592592593
8125355,1,B000FOT9LW,"I did not look closely at the run time for this video - 15 minutes, that is it.  It did not even include the entire 60 minutes episode.  You can get the same information for free on YouTube.  This DVD was not worth the price or information.",1172361600,4,240,4.0638297872340425
8125356,5,B000FOT9LW,I really enjoyed the honesty of Prince Charles. He has finally found his happiness. It is awesome that Prince Charles is speaking out!,1155600000,,134,4.869565217391305
