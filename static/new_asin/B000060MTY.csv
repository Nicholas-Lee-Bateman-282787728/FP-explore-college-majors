1681109,4,B000060MTY,"Excellent audio/video quality. Explanation of events is very easy to understand thanks to the animation sequences and the holographic set, however, they don't get very deep in concept and may cause you to have more questions than answers at the end of the show. Overall: VERY GOOD.",1032393600,,281,5.0
1681110,5,B000060MTY,"This program shows that these two words can, and in fact must be related. Over 3 hours of space related knowledge divided into 6 shows focus on various space themes from the ""SETI search program"" to ""What does a Black Hole look like"" to ""Will we ever colonize Mars?"". Produced with state of the art computer images that enhance the presentation and make it fun, Hyperspace is deeply rooted in scientific knowledge, but doesn't leave out the always present ""what if..."" - as opposed to many other similar documentaries. Interviews with experts from all around the globe in the different fields covered in the programs make them reliable and informative. Sam Neill hosting takes the viewer by the hand and kindly places him/her inside the video. With his soft, convincing tone he could turn the yellow pages into poetry ;) This has to be the greatest documentary of this kind that I have ever seen. Once you sit down to watch it you will not want to stop. Hope they make another run of six! If you're into space exploration and knowing our universe, you can't let this one pass.",1030492800,30,1076,4.668421052631579
1681111,5,B000060MTY,"Totally mesmerized, I watched this in one sitting. The CGI is totally incredible. The interviews and information so extremely interesting and well spoken, that it's heartwarming. ASTONISHING if you like space documentaries. Also the most informative one I've ever seen. It really was from the beginning to the end of the universe (or at least what we know of it).
There are dozens of stories that get more incredible than the last. If you have a 16X9 tele, your going to have a field day with this disc, it's the kind that I'm sure you will see vendors using to sell TV's. Gorgeous and engrossing. This is my favorite disc to date.",1028851200,,631,4.642857142857143
1681112,5,B000060MTY,"If you are one of those people who loves to be blown away by the sheer immensity of space - then this is for you! Hyperspace combines amazing visual effects with a well thought out, well presented narrative. It will amaze and thrill you with what humans have accomplished to date, what they may accomplish in the future, and by how much we already know about the enormous universe, and the very minuscule corner of it we inhabit. You can't help but feel small when the movie starts putting our solar system into scale with the rest of the known universe by showing exquisitely rendered fly-throughs of space. Consider this a must for any space-lover's DVD collection. This video alone has inspired me to re-read my university astronomy text book... and to begin saving for the biggest telescope I can afford :)",1027296000,,810,4.711267605633803

If you can't quite imagine just how massive our own sun is, or just how many solar systems there are in the our galaxy, then you MUST see this show.  I was completely amazed when it was finished.  Amazon should allow us to rate this one with 6 stars.",1017014400,9,330,4.290322580645161
1681114,5,B000060MTY,"God did not create the world - Sam Neill did (hehehe)
This is an excellent documentary for anybody ever wondered how it all started. How our earth was created and how i could ever write this ""review"".  I have given it 5 stars because it is very educating and ""easy"" to understand. This is the first and maybe the only documentary to do so. 5 stars is also for the entertaing concept of it. Filled with CGI (comput.graphics)
It might pass as a good saturday night entertainment as well.
I watched it on Discovery, and if the sound and the picture is as good as it was on my tv (11-2001), it will be a great dvd for your documentary collection. Since i am just an ordinary movie-watcher, i cannot write a critical review for this doc.
I am just an ordinary and hungry wolf for good docs and movies.
It takes you through everything from how stars are created and their life-cycle, to how life started out down here (earth).
40% of this doc. is a feast for the eye. The rest is a nut for the brain. Have no fear. I promise you. If you have read this review, you are atleast curious about what this ""hyperspace"" is. This must mean you are interested in the space.
You won't be dissapointed as long as you are aware that this is a documentary and not a movie. Fasten your seatbelts, sit back, and let Sam take you on a journey you won't regret you took.
Enjoy the ride :-))",1014163200,22,1367,4.257692307692308
1681145,5,B000060MTY,"A very impressive presentation of Astronomy and related disciplines, showcasing our present (at that time) knowledge.  A visual treat with state of the art graphics cleverly presented.  Sam Neill is  a great host, with a laid back style that makes it seem like he is talking to a friend, not a TV audience.  Perfect for the layman, perhaps a little too simplified for the expert.  The DVD includes material left out of the VHS version, which makes it 6 easy installments if one can't do one sitting for the full run time!  Money well spent",1379116800,,539,4.621052631578947
1681146,5,B000060MTY,Thoroughly enjoyed this program. If you like touring the universe and excellant graphics you will love this disc. Sam Neill is a great narrator.,1376092800,,144,5.041666666666667

1681148,5,B000060MTY,"Despite being a little outdated this is still one of my favorite DVDs on space, I can watch it over and over again. There is something in the dynamics of the filming, the music, the people, the locations that works magically on the viewer's emotions. I recommend it to beginners.",1361232000,,279,4.6
1681149,5,B000060MTY,"I loved this program. As one who has seen many shows on this subject, each episode is well run and filled with just enough images and thoughtful expert opinions and their ground-breaking experiments to both inform and sooth the viewer. The host is a kind of philosophical man who uses a kind of sci-fi method to explain the universe, and he is filmed in some of the most beautiful spots on Earth. Like Secrets of the Unknown hosted by Edward Mulhare, Sightings by Tim White, In Search Of by Leonard Nimoy, or From Here to Infinity by Patrick Steward, or recent programs by Stephen Hawking and the newer series by Morgan Robertson and Neil G.Tyson's newest show, this series is also constructed very well in terms of narration, direction, factual and theoretic content, and in asking the right questions about our place in the universe. Above all, however, the graphics are superior in these episodes then any other show I had yet watched up till then; the shaky camera semi-blurred and sweeping routine of seeing a black hole devour a star, or seeing Mars as a green and blue world, or seeing vast clumps of galaxies, or watching Earth be born from billions of bits of flying rock matter as it's creation, or seeing our sun grow and explode was done with great attention to detail. Most interestingly, the show highlighted the occasional visit our solar system takes through the danger zones of our part of the galaxy; a danger zone that disrupts out planetary neighborhood to occasionally send bis pg comet debris towards Earth--extinction of the Dinosaurs because of this visit? Perhaps. It takes a  million years or so for a comet to come in from the disrupted Ort Cloud beyond Pluto's orbit, and it's been a million years since the last time we passed through the danger zone--are we next to die off? The hunt for ET was creative yet factual; spelling out overall the spectacular yet good odds of another species communicating with us, or us with ET. As good as the Universe Series on the History Channel was, this show was a fine exploration of the cosmos for the thoughtful viewer and a great source of scholarly information. It's the BBC at some of it's finest.",1360972800,,2168,4.705263157894737

1681151,5,B000060MTY,"I can still remember watching this on the Discovery channel when I was in eighth grade, and how much I was absorbed into it. I am so glad that I found it after all this time, now being able to look at it from a more mature, adult perspective.

The idea that the material that gave rise to life on Earth came from outer space is an ovrwhelmingly mind-boggling idea, but definitely not something to ever rule out. Humanity definitely has to be aware of the dangers out there in space, be it from comets, asteroids, and even black holes. It definitely makes the viewer realize that the Earth is really in a very hostile environment, and how lucky we as human beings really are to be here. The question of whether or not we are alone is a topic that has intrigued humanity for as long has it has existed, and never fails to cater to extended discussion. Most importantly, is the fact that our planet will not last forever. Eventually, we as human beings have to consider to challenge of seeking out new homes in space if we are to have a long-term future, but to do that, we still have to overcome the obstacle of vast distances in interstellar space travel.

These are the topics discussed with this superb documentary, hosted by the legendary Sam Neill. Since this documentary is about a decade old, it may be a bit outdated, but it is still very interesting and eye-opening for anyone that has what might be called an open mind.",1353628800,,1427,4.442748091603053

1681153,5,B000060MTY,"I am a cosmos/science of Space programs junkie. Have seen almost all programs dedicated to this subject.  Hyperspace is a clever way to get a crash course on all subjects from Big bang all the way to future (end of universe).  It captivates using analogy that an average person can understand, with beautiful visuals, interesting soundtrack.  It is a BBC production which in my opinion is best in these documentaries. You get a nice british accent of the host, making it more appealing.  This series covers from beginning of Big Bang to Future of the Universe, it is a crash course series understanding the Universe the way it works, so this series covers briefly all the subjects and does not go into deep details.  For more experienced audience it might be less satisfying covering basics which they already know.  One other beef I have with this series;  visuals are eye catching, and I am disappointed they did not transfer the series into Blu-Ray media.
Verdict:

Pros: Using analogy that are much easier to understand, perfect crash course about Universe from beginning to end
  BBC production which delivers classic accent, and is well known for the best documentaries in the business
  Beautiful visuals, great soundtrack
  Very creative series
Cons:
  No Blu-Ray option
  General coverage on the subject, series is too short to cover details of each concept, might not be satisfying for more advanced audience

Verdict: If you want to learn all about Universe from beginning to the end and between, this series is great starting point. Visuals, audio and
easy to understand concepts are great for students, teenagers, and adults learning something new about the way universe works.",1277596800,,1690,5.014388489208633
1681154,5,B000060MTY,"This video is comprised of 6 separate 30 minute shows about space and our place in it.  Topics range from Black Holes to the Search for E.T.'s

The video is top notch and Sam Neil has the perfect voice for narration.  The visuals are very cool(as good as any Hollywood movie about space) and the topics are very cool for anyone interested in where science may take us in the near and distant future.

If you love science behind the movies type of stuff wrapped in documentary style t.v. then you will love this.  5 Stars for production and content.

More on about my work then click:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master-Within/dp/0557033799/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master Within</a>",1262822400,,733,5.5
1681194,5,B000060MTY,"Hyperspace (2002) was an unconditional five star DVD on space related topics and one of the best I have ever seen. A great mini-series by BBC video, Hyperspace covered: Star Stuff describing how the very matter of our bodies originated within stars. Staying Alive dealt with near extinction class impacts between various celestial bodies and the earth, moon and Jupiter. The special role of Jupiter in helping to increase the average time between earth impacts is also described. Also presented were detailed programs on Black Holes, SETI and ET's, New Worlds in space, tera-forming and more.

These subjects are elegantly discussed by Sam Neil, as well as many prominent guest speakers. Hyperspace was illustrated with beautiful CGI, visual material photographed by Hubble and footage taken at various locations around the earth. It also featured a beautiful musical score. I can't emphasize enough how good many of the CGI animations were at making you feel you had witnessed formative celestial events.

I also can't say enough about how useful a space science DVD this would be in the class. The only negative thing I can say is that it was a bit too honest about the possibility of some space calamity in the distant future (i.e., impacts with extinction class celestial objects, black holes swallowing up our sun and other fanciful tragedies which are probably too negative and unlikely for very young minds to grasp with the necessary perspective).",1250812800,,1455,5.109243697478991
1681195,5,B000060MTY,"Well no need to introduce Sam Neill as an actor. He is of of the best.

Movie itself well done. A lot of computer graphic along with Hubble images and commentaries. Very educational and computer animation so vivid that it gives you a moment to think if all theories of astronomers are right. Let say if our Moon was formatted out of collision Earth when it was ball of fire with another one then according to law of impulse it would be splash in case of direct hit or Earth would be out of its orbit. Anyway that kind of collision would not provide perfect placing of Earth and Moon on their orbits. But theory is theory and it was put in the movie excellent animated. Still gives you space of your own thoughts. Something like life come to Earth on the back of big meteor. Then dinosaurs were wiped out because of impact of next one. Well it seams to me that last meteor was ridden by cave man :-). Well any way this very good made movie covering Space, Solar system, Galactics, black holes, Life on Earth and possibility of lives on other planets. Movie divided on 6 parts 180 min in total each episode is accompanied with music and sound effects which is very well fit to moments which supposed to be emphasized. I've truly enjoyed watching it.",1250640000,,1443,4.938271604938271

1681198,5,B000060MTY,"I first watched the BBC series Space  by Sam Neil on TV and was so interested that I decided to buy it on DVD.  Then I watched it again several times on DVD. It is a very good program that I highly recommend to everybody interested in Astronomy.

This is not an all inclusive program about every topic in astronomy. If you are looking for such encyclopedic information I recommend the DVD Cosmos ; our Solar System and Beyond which is very good and maybe more suited for your purposes. However, this DVD does not claim to explain everything about Space. It concentrates on the philosophic questions of what are the immediate and long term risks to the continuation of human and all other forms of life on Earth originating from Cosmic dangers. And more importantly what the humans can do to overcome such risks and survive. The program does not imply that human and other forms of life on Earth are threatened only by cosmic dangers. Surely, there are man induced and other non- cosmic dangers to life on Earth. But this program's subject matter is only the cosmic dangers.

There are three main cosmic dangers according to this DVD. The first two could happen any time and the third is billions of years away. All three dangers are real, not fiction. The first two are known, and the program does not claim to be the first to discover them : 1 ) The threat of Earth being hit by an astreroid, a comet or a big meteorite 2 ) The Earth being swallowed by a black whole. 3 ) The long term danger of several billion years in the future is the death of our sun and before the death becoming a red giant and swallowing up the solar system. If human life is still on Earth by that time, it will have to flee Earth to other worlds in the cosmos, because there will be nothing humans can do to stop the sun from becoming a red giant. The question that arises is : given the incredible distances in the universe between the stars, how can humans travel in space fast enough to get to other worlds where life can continue. ?

 The short term problem of  Earth being hit by a celestial object is an issue humans can do something about and there are several alternatives to be considered. The possibility of Earth being swallowed by a black hole sounds like science fiction but Sam Neil explains convincingly that the danger is real and the probability not so remote. Again the only thing that can be done is to flee Earth. The problem is humans are not technologically advanced enough yet to do this should the need arise in the short term.

The presentation of the subject in the DVD is very good with relevant questions raised by Sam Neil at appropriate times followed by a careful analysis of alternative possible answers. The information is given in a context of high quality computer induced imaging and sound effects. It is by no means an empty sound and light show. The amount of rich information is more than satisfying, causing the careful, motivated and interested viewer to think about the philosophical questions raised. The best way to teach and learn is through motivation that this DVD succeeds in doing. The same subjects could have been presented in a dull and boring way. In that case keeping the attention of the viewer would have been more difficult.

So if you are interested in Astronomy you must buy and watch tis DVD.",1206662400,,3330,4.509121061359867
1681199,4,B000060MTY,"This DVD initially caught my eye because I had previously read a book by Michio Kaku called ""Hyperspace"".  Since this had a similar title I thought it would be on a similar subject.  This isn't true at all; apparently this was originally released by the BBC under the title of just ""Space""... which is probably a far more apt title.  Considering Kaku's book dealt a lot with quantum physics and multi-dimensional properties, I think a lot of people will think this product falls into that category.  This is more of an introductory DVD on general cosmology.

After reading reviews here, I learned what it was actually about, but what ended up motivating me to purchase it were the reports of excellent graphics and the fact that it's narrated by Sam Niell.  I really like Sam Niell as an actor, he was great in Jurassic Park and even better in Event Horizon (in my opinion), and so narrating a documentary should seem interesting.  It also makes me assume that Sam Niell is also into this subject, rather than just some paid actor (although he is probably that as well, but I hope to think that he agreed to do this because he finds the subject interesting).

This documentary really is very introductory.  So if you're looking to delve into some of the heavier material of astrophysics or properties of gravitation, or anything of a more in depth nature, then this is not a documentary you're looking for.  It really is excellent to introduce students or anyone with a passing interest into these subjects though.  It has very high quality eye catching graphics and very accurate content.  This is only one disc and its split into six episodes, about 30 to 45 minutes each in length.  It takes you through a veritable tour of the sequence of life in the universe, starting off with how stars are created all the way until they can die.  It even goes into how Earth can be affected by the galaxy around it and what major dangers we could possibly face.  ""Hyperspace"" spends a fair amount of time on that subject in particular and goes into a decent amount of detail.  It also goes into speculation of how we may be able to avoid such dangers and how we may one day eventually be able to leave this planet.

I just finished watching it, and even though I knew most of the things that were discussed on the DVD I still found it an interesting and entertaining show to watch.  I realize that Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" is probably superior, but it's far more daunting.  I think the BBC's aim may have been to target newer audiences and get them engaged in this kind of research.  Having it in 30 to 45 minute segments really makes this accessible for teachers in high school or earlier.  It's like having an abridged version of the more in depth material found in ""Cosmos"", which I think is a smart move.  When I went looking for documentaries of this particular nature, I couldn't find too many on DVD that seemed adequate and covered a broad base of research.  ""Hyperspace"" fit my criteria after viewing it.

As some people have mentioned the tone of the show is pretty doom and gloom.  But seriously... Sam Niell is narrating this, think about the movies he's acted in!  I mean come on; he played the Antichrist in the third Omen movie.  I personally liked this factor because I really don't think the average person really understands a lot of the factors that our planet could possibly interact with on a daily basis.  I mean, it's no secret this planet will eventually die and be completely destroyed.  ""Hyperspace"" just makes the viewer aware of that situation and to motivate people to start thinking far outside the box.  As humans go, we live a pretty short amount of time, so a lot of scientist's dream of being able to do certain things and a lot of times without public backing their dreams won't be realized.  I think this helps to raise the public awareness of where science is.  This is basically telling people what they're working on.  Scientific research is often funded corporately and publicly (via taxes), so it's products like this that help us see where all this research is leading us... oh, and most people pay for that corporate involvement too, since we buy products from corporations.  I mean, people don't really think that General Electric doesn't spend all their money on producing stuff; they have a huge R&D budget too.

To comment further on what others have mentioned here already, I didn't see it mentioned anywhere that this DVD implies our sun will eventually explode into a supernova.  I think it's pretty well documented that our sun lacks the mass to fully go nova.  Rather the language used to describe our sun in this DVD is that it will eventually die.  Now they are at fault for not going into detail as to how exactly that will happen, but it didn't really imply it would go nova.

Overall, Niell is an incredibly engaging host who really makes you get involved with the show.  It's spelled out fairly simplistically (almost without enough detail in some sections), but overall it is an excellent introduction.  I would highly recommend this to people who have an interest in cosmology, or want to share with someone just getting interested in the subject.  Even for veterans of the world who have read more than enough books, this DVD is still quite entertaining to watch given the graphic quality.  Enjoy... and see what the future holds for our galaxy.",1203465600,,5394,4.6455696202531644
1681200,5,B000060MTY,Absolutely one of the best series we have ever seen!  Anyone who is interested in HOW WE GOT HERE should watch it. Took complicated principles & made them as simple as possible.  a must see!,1180915200,,190,4.4

1681202,3,B000060MTY,"The educational concept and execution of educational value behind Hyperspace is flawless, it's graphics outstanding and extremely engaging.  I would rate this as one of the better astronomy series, especially for young minds interested in the subject of astronomy; but, would do so with some reservation and a recommendation that someone be on hand to explain some concepts that were described inaccurately and that would mislead the person who unfamiliar with the subject and topics covered.

An example is the statements regarding stars such as ours, evolving and exploding in a supernova.  Our sun does not have enough mass to ""supernova"" nor does it have the companion that is normally associated with supernova's.  Even to say that our sun will nova when all of the hydrogen is consumed is inaccurate, which this program more or less implies.  Also, like many science programs, the viewer is lulled into the idea that mass and weight are the same thing ... they clearly are not!  So be aware, there are items presented in this program that are inaccurate and explained incorrectly.  Be prepared to explain them correctly if this is used in a classroom setting.",1165190400,3,1165,5.036458333333333
1681203,1,B000060MTY,This is great stuff for the folks who have been living in caves for the last 10-15 years. Absolutely nothing new here.,1159401600,5,118,4.409090909090909
1681232,5,B000060MTY,"After reading a lot of the negative reviews regarding this series...well, I simply had to write my own review. The main reason I felt obligated to do so is because many of the negative reviews failed to even touch on one of the best aspects to this series, that being the entertainment factor. Lets face it, documentaries are a unique form of entertainment in that they both educate and entertain. One of the things that all great documentaries share in common is that they find a balance between the entertaining and educating. With that being said, many documentaries fail horribly at achieving this balance. Take for instance Stephen Hawking's Universe. Universe has enough info in it to keep your mind busy for years to come but the presentation/entertainment side is severely lacking. If it weren't for Starbucks I would have never made it through the series in a conscious manner. For anyone who is not an avid astronomy freak, Stephen Hawking's documentary will without a doubt put them to sleep long before they learn anything interesting.

Its this balance of educating and entertaining that really separates BBC's Space from other astronomy documentaries like Steven Hawking's Universe. Sam Neil does a fantastic job presenting the material and the computer generated graphics are outstanding. These two things combine into a one two punch that very few space documentaries can match. With that being said, this series does have some flaws. One of the more prominent flaws is that there is an overabundance of speculation and not enough fact. Of course, you cant really cover these topics without some level of speculation. We wouldn't be where we are today in the field of astronomy without speculation. This series just tends to go a bit far in this regards. All in all its a minor problem and its easily overlooked.

The best way to describe this series is to say that it takes some of the more exciting and relevant astronomical subjects (such as life in space, meteorites, black holes, and what will eventually happen to the earth) and presents them in a fun and entertaining way. The visual effects play a significant role in this regard and they are nothing short of stunning. In fact, they are easily some of the best effects ever produced for an astronomy documentary and they are presented in an extremely unique way. Its kind of difficult to properly explain but what you ultimately wind up with is a large holographic type image that Sam Neil can interact with. Its really one of the more unique and creative aspects to this series and it really makes the subject matter that much easier to comprehend. I keep hoping that Carl Sagan's Cosmos will be given a hi-def facelift with visual effects of this magnitude.

As a testament to this series, my 12 year old nephew sat through this entire series completely mesmerized by the content and he even commented how much he enjoyed it. Thats pretty impressive considering he isn't really into astronomy. He didn't make it past the first episodes of Steven Hawking's Universe. The entertainment factor is ultimately where this series excels above the others astronomy documentaries on them market. Its capable of educating and entertaining people of all ages, regardless of their level of knowledge on this subject matter. In regards to viewers like my nephew, this is easily one of the best astronomy documentaries on the market. It may not be the most informing documentary but its certainly one of the most entertaining and for people that only have a slight interest in such subjects....well, that is really one of the most important aspects as it keeps them watching. A documentary can have all the information in the world but that really doesn't do much good if the viewer is too bored to continue watching it. Again, its all about the balance between entertaining and informing and Hyperspace strikes that balance perfectly.

Bottom line - This is certainly not the richest or the most educational astronomy series on the market and it does have its fair share of flaws. Fortunately its so well done and so entertaining that the flaws are quickly forgotten. Ultimately I think this series is exactly what the BBC wanted it to be, a fresh and entertaining look into some of the more common and relevant astronomical subjects facing us today. Sam Niel's presentation was absolutely spot on. He appears legitimately fascinated in the subject matter being presented.

1681233,1,B000060MTY,"The information provided in this DVD series is very limited and in some cases wrong! What is provided is very basic. Anyone who has taken astronemy classes or watched another similar TV series (such as Carl Sagan's) will learn nothing new. Very broad and inacurate assumptions are made without sufficient effort to gratify them (for example a black hole may devourer our solar system). Little factual information is presented to provide a clear picture.

I did not find the series entertaining, even with the decent CGI effects. I do not recommend this for anyone with a fair knowledge of astronemy.",1136937600,7,599,4.99
1681234,4,B000060MTY,"I really enjoyed this DVD a lot.  It explores most of the interesting and fascinating topics in astronomy.  The DVD is 180 minutes long with six 30 minute episodes.  The six episodes are STAR STUFF, STAYING ALIVE (danger of asteroids), BLACK HOLES, ARE WE ALONE?, NEW WORLDS (colonization and transformation of other planets) and BOLDLY GO (possibilities for future long distance space travel).  Everything about this video grabs your attention from beginning to end.  Sam Neill (from Jurassic Park) does an awesome job as a narrator.  The computer generated graphics are amazing and even the music is great!  After watching this video one will come away with a good sense of Earth's place in this vast neighborhood.  I am a science teacher and have shown this to my students.  By far it is one of their favorite videos compared to others I have shown.  There are a couple of downsides to this video.  Some of what is mentioned in the video is speculation or theory but seems to be presented as fact.  Also there is a reoccuring doomsday theme in each episode....mentioning the possibilities of us being wiped out by asteroids, swallowed by a massive black hole or our planet being consumed by the expanding Sun.  Overall though, this is still a great video and is recommended for anyone interested in astronomy and especially educators.",1133222400,16,1337,4.888888888888889
1681235,1,B000060MTY,"As a professor of physics, this series contained too much speculation. Documentary makers should stick strickly to what is known and at least try to inform viewers where they are speculating. This was poorly done in this program. I suggest you purchas NOVA Origins for a more factual and down to earth documentary.",1126656000,15,314,4.943396226415095
1681236,5,B000060MTY,"I was looking for a something like this for my 7 1/2 year old son who is fascinated by space, time, the wonders of stars and our planets etc ...  There were several choices I could have made but I went with ""Hyperspace"" based on the reviews here (as well as the reasonable price).

I was not disappointed.  My son loves these shows.  The creators kept each segment to 30 minutes which is just the right length of time for a young child to be expected to view programming like this.  As well, the way this program presents itself - almost - in an intimidating way - as one reviewer noted they felt a little objectionable over the show ""emphasizing the doom and gloom aspect of stellar cycles and cataclysmic impacts"" I found this method of presenting astronomy to a child the ""best"" form of space education.

What would ""Star Wars"" be without Darth Vader?  It takes a show like this, presented with an edge, to keep a young mind interested in the topic.  It worked!  Just ask my son about Black Holes & Super-Novas.

These shows are so exciting to him he replays them over and over.  Trying to present a program like this any other way and I guarantee you & your child will fall a sleep within 10 minutes.

The creators of this show went about producing Hyperspace in the correct manner to educate a young person's mind.  The terminology and explanations within this program is perfect for the average family.  It truly is a wonderful documentary series for the entire family.",1122595200,9,1475,4.516981132075472
1681237,5,B000060MTY,"A lovely video with incredible special effects.  It's great to know we are learning more and more about our neighborhood, the universe.  I think once mankind has proven it's goodness and sincerity, it won't be long before we have the proof of extraterrestrial life we are so diligently seeking.  Then we will know instead of believe the universe is teeming with life on a scale impossible to imagine.  The implications of this are enormous; it will prove there is a Great Original Creator Spirit who is growing and growing - coming face to face with God would be an unbelievably powerful and magical experience to the nth degree.  Please keep videos like this one coming!",1120867200,3,671,4.8
1681238,4,B000060MTY,"It has been over two decades since Carl Sagan's COSMOS made astronomy and cosmology an interest attainable to the masses. It was time for a new try. HYPERSPACE succeeds, but not like the original.

Instead of being a huge series of one hour shows, HYPERSPACE consists of just six half hour programs. These include a primer on stellar evolution, a piece on dodging comets and asteroids, another on black holes, speculations on extra terrestrial life, colonization of the solar system and points further out and, finally a look at possible modes of transportation to accomplish all of this. These programs are done at a very basic level but are generally done well with innovative graphic presentations. The only real objectionable thing about them is a desire to emphasize the doom and gloom aspects of stellar cycles and cataclysmic impacts.

Having recently rewatched COSMOS, I was struck by how dated much it was in the way of imagery and presentation. HYPERSPACE definitely pushes the mark forward in this respect. The discussions, however, are much more basic and contain less information. Both programs indulge in a bit of grand speculation but that is the nature of the beast and provides some its interest.

This might well be a good program for introducing the intriguing field of astronomy to the uninitiated but it would have been nicer if it had been meatier.",1117843200,7,1370,4.973799126637554

1681241,5,B000060MTY,"Ok, hands down - the presentation is fantastic. I've seen none better. If you're serious about space/physics/the cosmos...etc, this is a very enjoyable collection. I am a big fan of Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene and Einstein's work, and try my best to wrap my brain around it all.

In this dvd collection, you will find today's current explanations for how the earth formed, what the big bang is/was, the fate of our planet, the odds of a global disaster, new planets we're finding orbiting nearby stars, future telescope projects, thoughts on how to colonize other planets/moons, the odds of unintelligent & intelligent life elsewhere, hubble telescope pictures w/ explanations, hubble deep field, galaxy clouds, speed of cosmic communication, black holes at work...etc, etc. Truely great stuff. The list goes on...

However, what you will not find are the nuts & bolts to Einstein's equations. These subjects could be a dvd all their own, and are rightfully left out of this collection. There is no discussion of string theory, m-theory, multiple dimensions, dark matter or time travel. These subjects are fantastic and should be researched separately - they each deseve it.

In short, these dvds try to put the universe into perspective, and help you understand how truely large and amazing it is. It does not talk about UFOs or anything that is not fact - I have lent it to people who don't have the same passion for space as I do, and they have been amazed at the sights and explanations in these dvds.

Sam Neil does an outstanding job presenting you with information.

Highly, highly recommended.",1103587200,6,1603,4.9664179104477615
1681257,5,B000060MTY,"This set of DVDs has wonderful graphics designed to bring to life and down to earth what goes on out in space.

The DVD takes you through the birth and death of the stars and planets, then onto comets, asteroids and black holes, the relationship between all of the above, and constant dangers, which give these DVDs somewhat gloomy flavor.

Due to impending dangers - for that matter everything that is created in the physical world has beginning and the end, and so will eventually planet earth - the later DVDs in this series project us into the future attempting to provide possible and most likely solutions for life on earth by colonizing Mars.

That is an interesting possibility.  Number of scientists were interviewed - yet all that they came up with was rooted in our current knowledge and understanding.  That does make sense, but one may also consider the fact that science has made rapid progress even in the past 100 years, so it would only make sense that some more viable solutions that those which are presented as possibilities on these DVDs will emerge.

In the span of 100,000 years one could expect not only undreamed of advances in technology, but also raise in consciousness and understanding.  Perhaps one day quantum physics will get married to astrophysics and even the axiom that the ""expectations of the Observer ifluence the outcome of the observed experiment"" will bring yet other interesting solutions - the fact that we are not victims and at the mercy of the material world, but are creators of it.  That, though, is beyond the scope of these DVDs.",1099267200,13,1580,4.783088235294118

But I agree with the ""Colorfully uninformative"" review. If you are looking for a lightweight documentary, this may be very enjoyable. If you enjoy more information with your documentary, then this is definitely lacking.
To be fair, I only watched 3 of the 6 episodes. It just didn't hold my attention. Beautiful to look at, not enough to think about.
Younger viewers and those not ""into"" real science documentaries will probably enjoy this. The ""thinkers"" who like to ask questions and enjoy more information to ponder will probably be bored pretty quickly.

1681262,4,B000060MTY,"Excellent, but as mentionned above this documentary falls short on details and sometimes dwelves into pure science fiction debate. Such things has humans having to genetically engineer itself to survive and colonise other planets was a bit overboard for me.
Still this is an excellent documentary on how everything started, how the earth ended up being what it is and how lucky we are to be here. Scientific principle are well simplified and everything is explained clearly. Speaking of science, this documentary also includes a cool look at developing propulsion systems because, as this documentary makes clear, we're *FAR* from our nearest neighboor!

Sam Neill (""Event Horizon"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Merlin"") takes you by the hand and through a holographic projector ""launches"" you into an adventure that spans various billions of years.
BBC has outdone itself in this documentary.
""Cosmos"", hosted by Carl Sagan, was a unique milestone in explaining the Universe. It also was a masterpiece in its genre. ""Hyperspace"" is nothing else than its natural successor.
I loved every minute of it and I kept it running and running in my DVD player until I almost memorized the data.
The 3D recreations of galaxies, stars, planets and stellar phenomena are hauntingly relistic and offer a firework of the highest CGI design I have ever witnessed in a documentary of this sort.
Sam Neill is a fascinating, talented and multi-faceted actor and could manage to convince you to walk on water. With his suave and debonnaire way, he manages to explain science in such a way, that even the most unaware person would accept and understand.
All in all, if you are a documentary collector, or simply somebody who loves astronomy and space travel, you will have to own it.
