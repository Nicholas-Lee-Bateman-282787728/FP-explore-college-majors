8093386,2,B000BVY248,"This would be of value to someone taking lessons in Sun Style or anyone curious to see what it looks like. For students of this style, it can help you remember the sequence of the moves. There are 73 of them, and remembering them can be very difficult for anyone who has been studying it for less than a year.  The form is shown from the front, side, and back. The visual quality is excellent.

Unfortunately, there are no explanations of the moves (as claimed) or their applications. Occasionally, there are one or two sentences posted discussing tai chi, but these are worthless. At times, Guangzhi Xing makes comments, but his accent is so pronounced that it is impossible to understand them. For some insight into tai chi or the Sun Style, this DVD is of little value; one's teacher or a book would be more valuable. As I have said, it is of use solely for those studying it or to those thinking of doing so. A professional narrator should be hired to replace this martial artist's garbled comments.",1439510400,,1003,4.566666666666666
8093387,4,B000BVY248,This version of Sun Style Tai Chi is interesting but a little aggresive for a person of my age. Still fun to watch and always something to learn.,1383091200,3,145,4.214285714285714
8093388,5,B000BVY248,"I am learning the Sun Form from Master Xing, Guang as he is affectionally known, and this DVD allows me to pick up on the small details and nuances.  Excellent teacher of authentic Chinese Taiji Chuan.",1377388800,3,201,4.583333333333333
