8656536,5,B00K7H3VFM,"Mesmerism, when I first saw this documentary in an Airstream trailer as a preteenager, seemed a little flakey. These days with our advanced technology and our interlaced web of being the idea of mesmerism and the influence that the auditory arts can influence upon our cognition does not seem nearly so easy to dismiss. Could Judas Priest beat this case again were the incident to happen today? I certainly would not want to be the one on trial if such a charge came to pass. I recommend this film to anybody with the stomach to take such matters seriously. Not even the survivors came out of this tragedy unscarred and the audience must assume the same culpability, responsibility and risk. (Highly Recommended)",1505260800,,712,4.844262295081967
8656537,4,B00K7H3VFM,"Running time on this DVD is 57:18.  The only extras on the DVD are a series of short comments by the video producer of the documentary in 1992 and 2007.  The DVD is packaged in a cardboard sleeve/slipcase, featuring other DVDs from the product line and the author's two other documentaries.

This is a test case jaw-dropper of in-your-face belligerent smug stupidity of MONUMENTAL proportions, a comedy of black hole breadth and scope, the musical and law equivalent of the Three Stooges on steroids, and then some....

The prosecution initially had a good shot at a favorable outcome, had they been able to keep the family members out of the witness box and keep the focus of the trial on the rotten music business, on the poster child for mud-bottom art, the opera music of proles wearing mullets.  The target of the prosecution:  spikes, dog collars, black leather, biker memorabilia, an unsympathetic (for middle class adults) mid-level metal band, a target for any adult (parents) the prosecution could have packed on a 12 member civil jury, and only needed nine votes of Reno's finest unlettered citizens (200,000 strong in Washoe County to choose from) staring at the band. The incident and trial took place in the Calcutta of the West, Reno, a low-class dustbowl, at the Washoe County Courthouse a few blocks from the downtown Red Line (corner of 2nd St. and Virginia) casinos and pawnshops town center.  If the prosecution had played their hand safe, the match was already loaded and cocked in their favor.  All they had to do was not screw it up--ANY conviction precedent would have blown the roof off eeevil rock music brainwashing litigation waiting in the shadows of Tipper Gore's PMRC conspiracy crusaders.  Well, the first screw up was not seating a jury full of The Singing Nun, Anita Bryant, Glenn Miller, Bing Crosby, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, The King Family, Lawrence Welk Show, etc... self-styled respectable citizens with kids.  Putting the outcome in Judge Jerry Whitehead's (an educated man: conspiracy weirdo pesticide) sympathetic but skeptical, logical discretion:  strategic boo boo of the first magnitude.

Yes, watch this and all the face-palm screw ups, one after another.  The plaintiffs put together no case (no recording logs, no sound engineers as witnesses from the recording sessions, no AFM session documents, no company internal documents showing any paper trail that doctored subliminal stimuli existed and any quantitative statistics if it worked and how well $$$, no peer reviewed papers about ""backward masking"" from legitimate universities' scientific studies funded by major corporations, no proprietary marketing information from the Muzak Corporation documenting any links behind music and consumer purchasing habits going back to before the Depression?), no, just an amateur sound expert pal trying to backspin an album like all the high school and college dorm kids' had been doing for years since 1981, prompt the judge that a 1978 album had iron-clad MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE properties, well, at least once.

If the court had ruled the urban legend, the 1981 balloon juice hoax, that ""backward masking"" existed and was effective, the South would have exploded with ""Hosannas!"" from preachers railing against syncopated jungle music ancient Egyptian voodoo demon spirits rock music, Southern California's urban population would have exploded with millions of itinerant contingency fee product liability lawyers relocating to Los Angeles nirvana looking to make a killing suing record labels and corporate rock bands, and state legislatures would again (as in California and Arkansas in 1982) have been bombarded with calls to ban subliminal demonic incantations.  The Doodletown Pipers may have been able to stage a comeback as the hardest rock music a kid could sneak into his mom's basement in the aftermath; even the rock music of the Osmonds might've become commercially toxic with that hard-rock glam beat from 1970+.

And then there were the immediate family members kicking one field goal after another for the defense through the goal posts.",1436400000,,4090,5.230886850152905

8656539,5,B00K7H3VFM,"I saw this when it originally aired on PBS many years ago.  In fact, I taped it and a few years ago, I burned it to dvd - that's how strong an impression it made.  I was both pleased and very surprised to find it for sale all of these years later.  It still packs a real punch.

I watched my new dvd today and what surprised me most was how much my own perspective had changed.  When I first saw it in the early 90's, I was completely outraged at the parents/families of these two young men.  I was outraged at their dysfunction, how out of touch they were with their children, their inability to own their own responsibility and most of all, I was outraged at their determination to pin the blame on metal music (specifically Judas Priest music), a genre of music I loved then and now, for the actions of their sons.  The bible-thumping offended me to no end and I was convinced that these families were suing Judas Priest to not only make themselves feel better, but to perhaps collect some nice settlements too.

Although I still have ALL of these same feelings, in watching this again 25 years later, I found that my outrage has softened a bit.
I can appreciate now what a tragedy this event was on ALL sides.  Ultimately, this was simply a powerful documentary for me; for the families, it is a tragedy that never goes away;  For the guys in Priest, judging from their demeanor in the film, I'll bet the memories still pop up now and then too.

For me, even then, what makes this documentary so powerful is that despite a horrific tragedy, justice did prevail.  Back then and even more so now, I marvel at the integrity and wisdom of that trial judge, in Reno, NV, in the late-80's, in a trial that had church-going members of his community pitted against a British, stud-wearing, big-haired metal band. It would have been soooo easy for that judge to rule the band's ""subliminal messages"" responsible for the suicide pact of the two local boys. This was not a big splashy trial.  The lawyers didn't look high-powered and there were no lines of spectators trying to get in each day nor world news agencies packing the front of the courthouse.  This was pretty much a local story - and one on MTV and in Rolling Stone.  However, the judge was fair and was able to discern what occurred: two disillusioned, troubled teens had a really dumb idea and unfortunately, actually carried it out.  Where their families tried to make the boys' love of metal music the smoking gun, the judge was strong enough to rule that their love of metal was simply a fact and not a factor.

Even though I still have my dvd of my original recording, I thought this documentary important enough for me to buy a ""real"" dvd of it. One might have thought that after 25 years, we as humans would be farther along in not making stereotyping judgments about people and events.  A look at today's headlines tell us how little we have progressed.  The judge in this case still inspires me that we can do better.",1418083200,5,2983,4.450367647058823

8656542,5,B00K7H3VFM,"I've never listened to Heavy Metal or even remember this legal case when it happened but after watching Dream Deceivers I was so haunted by it, it stayed with me for days.

The story is sad and the images are gruesome. Those unfamiliar with case, it's about two teenagers who attempted suicide by shooting themselves with a sawed off shotgun; Ray Belknap died instantly but James Vance survives only to be horribly disfigured. He's difficult to watch and later blames their actions on subliminal messages embedded in Judas Priest songs; essentially the music literally drove them ""to do it."" The argument seems ludicrous now and having grown up with N.W.A's, Straight Out of Compton incomprehensible to me. Dream Deceivers documents the court case, explores their unhappiness, briefly touches on issues of personal responsibly and attempts to give you a better understand of their lives through interviews with like-minded Heavy Metal fans.

While the court case and debate over subliminal messages are interesting I found the cast of characters to be far more fascinating. The members of Judas Priest are featured and their perspective is essential to the story but I was riveted by the interviews with James, his parents and Ray's family. Each has different reasons for blaming the music and I found the psychology behind their motives intriguing.

For me, James's mother Phyllis was the most unnerving. Although his disfigurement is depressing I found her to be far more disturbing. She's prominently featured in the film and it's easy to see why she blames Heavy Metal for her son's problems. This sanctimonious, ""born again,"" woman easily quotes the bible but cannot remember if her son was unhappy. She repeatedly minimizes horrible, tragic situations and takes no responsibly for exposing James to a life full of physical and emotional abuse. Phyllis is defensive, indifferent, and oblivious to her son's despair. I hated her and watching her get grilled on the stand is pure schadenfreude. Since watching the film I've read a lot about the case and learned James showed signs of being deeply disturbed from an early age; at ten, he tried to strangle her. That's not rebellion, it's rage and the more plausible scenario is he learned violence from watching it at home rather than listening to some Judas Priest CD's. Phyllis believes God chose her to be James's mother; he could have done a lot better.

Ray's mother is equally baffled by the suicides and looks permanently shocked by his death. She's a far more sympathetic character and her motivation appears to be driven by profound grief. Early in the film, Phyllis piously quotes the bible and says, ""I don't know when I lost him (James)."" This seems to apply more to Ray's mother and her interviews are heartbreaking.

I have my own theories as to why James turned on the band he once worshiped but they're not based on the film. There's lots of information about this case online and the articles and interviews provide a clearer picture as to why Heavy Metal became the scapegoat for this tragedy. One of the best is from the Daily Beast. However, this is not to say Dream Deceivers misses it's mark. At the time, this documentary did its best and it still delivers. The film tries to tell all sides of a complicated the story in way that is fair and honest. It's powerful and well worth watching.",1407542400,18,3363,4.9033391915641475
