8435250,5,B004LX0LFG,"An elegant and inspiring documentary film. The story of Eugne Atget & Berenice Abbott is one of the real gems in the history of photography. The amazing thing about this film is that it explains very simply how one major artist (Abbott) spent a large part of her life promoting the work of another artist (Atget). In my opinion this sort of selflessness is nearly unheard of in the arts. Abbott is a true one of a kind for her promotion of Atget, and as we learn from this film, her work to promote Atget only helped her to blossom as an artist - its great stuff. Abbott's interviews are fantastic to see as are the others who are in the film - who like Atget and Abbott all are working photographers and artists. There are no 'experts' teaching us in this film, only real life photographers who are passionate about Abbott & Atget. The film is also wonderful because it allows the viewer to really look at the photos from these two giants of photography. The films pace is slow but extremely engaging, which I really appreciate. I also learned some interesting facts about Paris and New York city from this film. If you want a beautiful and stimulating 52 mins looking at gorgeous images of Paris and NYC this is the film to see!",1490054400,,1230,4.446902654867257

8435252,5,B004LX0LFG,"I greatly enjoyed the story of Eugene and Berenice.  The story, the photos they took and their lives revisited through this documentary shed new light on Paris and New York and introduced me to these two wonderful characters.  I highly recommend this documentary.",1297900800,5,263,5.093023255813954
8435253,5,B004LX0LFG,I loved this documentary.  What dedication and research is shared in this film.  Outstanding musical score.  Tight editing and careful explanations of the material.  Just great!,1297900800,4,177,5.6923076923076925
8435254,5,B004LX0LFG,"Saw this movie recently and was really impressed. I really appreciated how it shone a light on environment as muse. Both Abbott and Atget drew inspiration from the cities they loved. They documented two cities, Paris and New York, during periods of great historical significance. While I heard vaguely before that Abbott championed Atget later in life and is the reason we are still are aware of this man's work, I was not aware of the impact Atget had on Abbott after she met him on her work (Abbott changing from mainly portraiture to street scenes). The documentary also did a great job bringing alive the Parisian art scene in the 20's, which was such an interesting time. Anyone interested in the history of photography or art or the history of Paris and New York should check this film out.",1296950400,,796,4.692857142857143
8435255,5,B004LX0LFG,"This film tells the story of two incredibly talented photographers with the backdrop of two incredible cities.  Eugene's photos of Paris represent the best collection anywhere of photographs of the old Paris.  To understand how he approached his work, with heart, mind and creative process, is perfectly demonstrated in this film.  Berenice's admiration of Eugene's work and her own career in New York is clearly documented as well.  The film takes you from the Eugene's Paris to Berenice's New York through their philosophy of, and talent for, the photographs they took of the cities they loved.  This film is as much a story of two photographers as it is the ""tale of two cities"".  It captures Paris' architectural transition and New York's architectural birth.  Eugene taught Berenice technique and they each dedicated their lives to the work.  We see Paris and we see New York through their work and this film.  I love the way the film moves seamlessly from Eugene's Paris to Berenices New York.",1296777600,3,999,4.969879518072289
8435256,5,B004LX0LFG,"This beautifully-made documentary dives into the dynamic relationship between a young woman, later to become one of New York's leading photographers, and her mentor and employer, Eugne Atget,  the extraordinary photographer of Paris spaces, light, architecture and ambiance.  You don't need to be a specialist to enjoy this film, it captivates your atttention and leads you through relationships with Man Ray and other artists of the day at caf's and artist ateliers.  Before it's over, you'll want to pull up a chair in the Luxembourg Gardens, and bask in the promenade of people & light.",1296777600,,589,5.178947368421053
8435257,4,B004LX0LFG,"This movie take you below the surface of who Eugene Atget was, the father of modern photography.  I loved the images in this film and how the film reveals the deep relationship between Atget and the American photographer Berenice Abbott, whose photographs of 1930s New York became the iconic images of that era. Abbott recognized Atget's genius and became his champion for over 40 years. This film is a must have for anyone interested in photography history.",1296777600,,458,4.9480519480519485
