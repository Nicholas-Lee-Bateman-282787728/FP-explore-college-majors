8442715,4,B004V2FVQQ,"aya Bhaduri at her best with a tremendous supporting cast. Terrific tale of an elderly wealthy man who comes to realize that he is valued only for his money even by those closest to him. He becomes distraught and sets out wandering the rural countryside dressed as a pauper to see if he can find just one person who will love him for his inner being, his heart. The story is masterfully told and beautifully acted. Wonderful songs. Chocked full of wisdom points underscoring the highest of traditional 'old-fashioned' values.
This film is a MUST SEE for all. Especially valuable for families to view together.",1304985600,,609,4.809523809523809
