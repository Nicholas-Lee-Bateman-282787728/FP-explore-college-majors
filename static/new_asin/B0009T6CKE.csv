8066400,2,B0009T6CKE,"Specifically regarding the ""Saturday Matinee"" DVD release by Cascadia featuring Texas Masquerade and Renegade Trail, starring William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy. Unfortunately, Cascadia's DVD is the only DVD available with the two films. Regretably, the source prints are far below those used by Cascadia Labs for other DVDs.

Texas Masquerade is adequate as the density and contrast are good. However. the image is soft. So, watch on a small, regular television rather than a big, HD screen. Renegade Trail is from a substandard print which is very soft, missing frames, poor contrast and has audio dropouts plus a hum throughout the soundtrack. This only will appeal to Hoppie addicts, desperate for a fix.

Only a fanatic would pay more than two dollars for this DVD. It belongs at the Dollar Store.",1173052800,,800,5.099236641221374
