After getting in tune, Joe Carr demonstrates various picking exercises for the beginner. Building off the A-scale, the DVD shows the right hand strokes, but there is no separate view of the left hand notes. That's OK because the tablature clearly shows where to fret the instrument. However, the tab didn't come with the lesson. Instead, you download the free instructional booklet, as a PDF file, at  [...] That will necessitate your having Adobe or some other similar software capable of reading PDF files. Working with a metronome, Carr's exercises (like ""quarters and eights"" and ""shuffle"") are good, standard fare for a mandolin workshop. Pay attention to his down picking, alternating, or combination methods as they form the basis for bluegrass mandolin. He also shows a few techniques for crosspicking. Carr serves on the bluegrass and country music faculty at South Plains College in Levelland, Texas. He has a number of instruction books available, and this one covers the very basic elements to get started. (Joe Ross, staff writer, Bluegrass Now)",1146873600,4,1198,5.143589743589744
