3996869,3,B002VKI6BW,"'Allo.  Tormented is a ripping British take on the modern slasher flick.  A bullied young bloke at a snooty prep school has taken his own life, and the ones responsible are receiving nasty texts with death threats.  One by one, they are offed in very creative ways, many times in the fashion of their bullying style.  This is like Skins (that stupid British show about promiscuous, drug-addled twats), but with lots of gore.

Usually in these types of films, some of the characters have some redeeming qualities and you feel some empathy when they bite the dust.  But I must admit, I've never wanted to see a bunch of sick, twisted, egotistical wankers die so much in my life.  What a loo of toffee-nosed twits.  Good riddance.

Bangin', bloody fun.",1321142400,,749,4.7
3996870,3,B002VKI6BW,"Part revenge flick, part slasher, part body-count and part supernatural, Tormented can easily fit into any of these categories with imagination to spare.  That doesn't necessarily mean the movie is unredeemable.  It starts out strong enough.  There are lots of varied characters and you really think Tormented might turn into something special.  Sadly, Tormented ends up orientating itself around the nastiest clique in school.  We therefore have to see the rest of the movie through their eyes, and by extension, main character Justine, who is utterly without spine and utterly malleable depending on which clique she associates with.  Yawn.  If you're looking for the Message, Tormented doesn't have anything profound to say other than be careful who you bully today, because you could end up on the short list for payback in the future.  If there is any recurring theme throughout this movie, it is one of disgust:  disgust at the lengths people will go to bully someone who can't defend their own self, disgust at the faculty for being complicit in the bullying, and disgust at all the main characters who have no redeemable qualities whatsoever.  The writer/director makes sure the viewer is left in no little doubt that they will get what they have coming to them.  The real ""torment"" of this movie is having to wait so long for the comeuppance while we endure the obligatory sex scenes and classist posturing.  The Sherlocks among you will notice that the agent of revenge is a zombie who inexplicably still needs to use his inhaler and wear swim-goggles when he cannonballs one of the girls in the swimming pool.  At this point it is probably wise to stop asking the important questions and just accept the movie for what is it as face value (whatever that is......) and go with it.  You could have done worse.",1304467200,,1818,4.879478827361564
3996871,5,B002VKI6BW,"This is a 2009 British horror movie about a teen that commits suicide and comes back to haunt the students who bullied him. This is NOT some old black and white horror movie that lots of people seem to think it is.

3996872,4,B002VKI6BW,"I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE TO BE RELEASED IN THE US!! I was investigating purchasing a Region-Free DVD player and having this shipped from Amazon UK just so I could own it, but now I don't have to--it made my day to discover this is coming out stateside in a just a few short months! Okay, sorry, review is below (same as the one that appears on the UK Edition being sold by other users).

I watched this movie just a couple of weeks ago because I had seen a trailer for it months back, but with school closing out, I had to put projects first and watching a movie I only have access to through the glory of Youtube was not on my priority list. I, however, finally found the time to sit and watch this horror film, with the volume a little low (with a mother in the house who cringes at the word ""crap"", point made). Perhaps I should begin with a short summary: The premise of the movie is that an unpopular student has just committed suicide and the vastly popular in-crowd (comprised of actors Alex Pettyfer [upcoming Beastly], April Pearson, Dimitri Leonidas, Tuppence Middleton, Georgia King [Wild Child], and others) are the people who bullied him mercilessly. The faculty and administration did nothing to solve the problem. That problem quickly turns against them when Darren's ghost or zombie, however you want to classify him, returns to seek revenge on them, killing them slowly, one at a time.

Now, when I first saw the movie trailer and researched the movie, since it has been out for about a year now, I figured that the graphics would be cheap, the blood fake, the language terrible, and the sex rampant. I was wrong on almost every account. Being a British film, the language is, of course, off the deep end, with the f word being the preferable choice of vocabulary, but nothing when compared to what an R rated movie can bring here in the States. There were only two sex scenes, which surprised me, but there was nothing absurdly ridiculous about them: next to no nudity, although there is no question the men are not in the slightest clothed; and they are not overly long and drawn out. The second one is cut short by a double murder, which in a morbid twist is refreshing because no one expects people to get axed while they're getting busy in a car--a bit for the irony, the film is.

On the other side of the scale involving the special effects, considering the movie was made all for under 2 million dollars, the graphics look amazingly top notch--Darren's reincarnation bears the resemblance of someone who clearly no longer has a beating heart, being gray in color, but not so decayed as to appear like he was stolen from the set of a Resident Evil movie. While still human in appearance, he has the handy nature that comes from being dead--only a few can see him, solid objects don't hinder him or kill him, and he has the ability to kill people while always appearing to be merely an apparition. The blood, which is no more gore than can be thrown around an American movie set, is highly stylized, yet not fake in slightest. There are moments where the blood shed is highly unrealistic, I have yet to see medical proof where hands being chopped off results in hose-like spraying of blood for minutes on end. The deaths, all-in-all, tend to avoid the characteristic suspension of disbelief that comes from movies such as these or other movies of the action genre in general. The only disbelief that is accepted is that a ghost is killing living people, something that the movie going audience has accepted as possible since Freddie Kruger, or possibly before him, I imagine.

In an interview I saw with the cast, they described the movie and it is classified as a Horror-Comedy. There are moments of humor that most anyone can appreciate, but overall the movie contains traces of a story too realistic to be humorous. Clearly, this is a classification that makes much more sense to the British audience, that I, as an American cannot see the humor laced heavily within the story. Another contributing factor is probably, also, because I'm a chick and women, somehow, do not find slasher movies as funny as our male counter-parts. This movie, in the end though, is not for those who are weak stomached in any sense--the deaths are especially terrible for the bullies and while the sexual contact was limited, the sexual jokes were not. All these qualities will definitely earn this film an R rating, but it is certainly not the worst R rated film I have seen, and nor will it be the last. It is, however, one of the better ones. I have seen similar movies before and they are movies I was glad to have seen once, but watching them again, I wonder in retrospect, why I ever liked them. I can tell you, upfront, that this movie completely avoids that category. The movie approaches the motive with realistic intensity and avoids the predictable ending of most slasher movies--Darren really is what is known as ""an unstoppable menace"" within the horror genre. By the end, you somewhat sympathize for what Bradley (Alex Pettyfer) and his gang of friends did to Darren, but you cannot sympathize with his character because of his actions--even his best friend did not survive.

Despite the fact that most horror movies avoid character driven plot for action driven plot, this movie finds a happy medium between the two. Since it is so rarely seen, the approach is refreshing and the screenplay biting. The characters are never fully fleshed out, but we see the results as a culmination of their actions. Darren's character we only see in his murderous rampage, but also in video clips of him being tormented in life. While many girls will swoon for the leading males and the leading ladies are no less stunning--a good looking cast all around--they are not people a viewer can fully sympathize with, even at the end of the film. I have heard and learned that a writing is not a success unless the main character(s) can be sympathized with on some small level (even if they are the villain) and even if it is the movies. Despite everything my English professors tell me, I am inclined to disagree on this one respect. As long as you are intrigued by the characters and the situation created by the dynamic to keep the plot moving and people interested, you have an in. This movie has that very in. An official DVD release in the United States is set for August 31st, 2010, and this small-time British film is one I shall keep on the list of things to purchase once it hits the East Coast (I am purchasing it the day it comes out).

Looking for a good horror movie, Tormented should be near the top of your list. If you're not one hundred percent sold, rent it first, but it is a movie I think, personally, everyone should see at least once.

3996874,4,B002VKI6BW,"I would rate this movie 4 stars for its genre.  Let's face it, slasher movies are not works of art but this one does manage to tell an interesting tale.  It is not your typical teen slasher.  Compared to american versions, it had less gore and it made clear that safe sex was practiced.

I thought that the bully theme was well done.  We start the film with a fellow student at a snobby school being eulogized by the top student, Justine.  One of the popular kids thinks Justine is cute and invites her to their party.  Justine eagerly drops her geeky friends for a chance to hang out with the ""in crowd"".

We soon discover that the dead student, Derrek, is not quite as dead as everyone thought.  We also discover that he has come back to torment those who bullied him in life.  The extent of the bullying was compelling.  Teachers, school administration and even students that ignored what was going on all play a part.  Watching the gym teacher gets his just rewards at the end (with a hilarious note) was nice to see.

While watching this movie, the viewer cannot root for the ""in crowd"" being justly tormented yet, we cannot be on Derrek's side either.  Derrek is presented as a menacing blob until the end, where we feel sympathy once the true extent of the bullying is shown.  That leaves Justine who is not exactly as lily white as she thinks.  Most teen slashers are very suspenseful yet short on fleshed out characters.  This movie did not contain any close your eyes moments but the characters were compelling.",1275696000,,1521,4.512820512820513

3996907,4,B002VKI6BW,"Ms. Barbara M. Muirhead's own review, for Amazon-Canada, is a nice enough one, for whatever the film that she saw may have been, but surely she saw another movie of the same title (""Tormented"", a moniker that several films have borne)! The one with Alex Pettyfer et alia, which this entry on Amazon lists and describes, is quite good, so I hope that the film of this title which Ms. Muirhead saw also was at least as good as this one.

The lover-boys who are among the high school's male students in this film are very good-looking, indeed, and not just Alex Pettyford, who himself is in fine fettle in this gory thriller. The first of the two sex scenes is really ""hot"", for the young guy, Dimitri Leonidas playing Alexis, is sensuously and sweetly cute, youthfully svelt, and romantic, and the girl whom he beds, Tuppence Middleton as Justine, is demurely pretty. Alex Pettyfer's shorter erotic scene, in the role of Bradley, a fatal one for him as well as for his girlfriend, Natasha (played by April Pearson), in which they have sex on a car seat, is shorter and the camera reveals less of Pettyfer's famously fine, sinewy lad-flesh.

The zombie or apparition, of Darren (acted by Calvin Dean) who is the suicided student, back from the dead, whom the other kids had bullied in life, really is a nemish-type, grossly overweight and ungainly, looking rather like a young James Levine; the famous conductor, who, however, in contrast to poor Darren, seems to have been popular in his own real life when so young, because of his great musical talents, widely admired early in life. Darren, for his part, in this gory saga had been one of the film's two ultimate targets of bullying by the movie's viciously tormenting schoolmates.

One of the few things about the film that disconcerts inconveniently is how hard it is to make sense of so much of the action, which is complex, with a bewilderingly large cast of  characters, of whose names it can be difficult to keep track. The plot summary on ""Wikipedia"" helps considerably. Although the entire film at present (mid-2013) can be viewed on YouTube, there are no subtitles there, which, present on at least some of the DVD editions, also can help viewers quite considerably, especially those who are unaccustomed to the sound of British English or who are hard of hearing.

Happy (and fright-filled) viewing!",1373241600,,2359,4.772058823529412
3996908,2,B002VKI6BW,"Tormented is a 2009 horror flick from the UK which has been called ""A slasher movie for the Skins generation"".

With a reported budget of less than 750,000, Tormented does not play out as a low-budget horror and feels pretty slick. The script is well thought out and well acted by its young cast with Alex Pettyfer eating up every scene he's in and the remainder are convincing as the beautiful yet downright nasty ""in-crowd"" at the school.

The effects, gore and death scenes are pretty spot-on with some interesting ways for the spoilt brats to be knocked off. There are some nice contemporary references and I feel that the issue of bullying is dealt with capably and the bullies portrayed well; displaying suitable disdain for those considered beneath them and under the impression they aren't actually in the wrong.

My problem with Tormented comes from the comedic aspect of the movie. The movie started off brilliantly and set the scene nicely with the overly-indulged toffs at school seemingly responsible for the suicide of one of their classmates and initially, the movie did play out like an episode of Skins but with a healthy dose of horror injected into it.

The antagonist as the resurrected wronged pupil is suitably malevolent but the moment when this particular flick jumped the shark for me came when just before attacking the female captain of the swimming team, he donned a set of goggles. Nonsense... Utter nonsense and detracted from what, until that point, was a decent horror movie.

I don't want to reveal the other farcical moments within the movie but I feel that this comedic element has significantly detracted from what should have been an outstanding contribution to British horror. Tormented had the feel of a British I Know What You Did Last Summer but the absolutely misjudged inclusion of inappropriate humour has soured the experience of the movie overall for me.",1352678400,,1900,4.925

3996911,4,B002VKI6BW,"Probably not a master piece but a good thriller and horror film on the horrible and un-thrilling practice of bullying in an English secondary school.

Bullying is a crime and in this case everything is good for the bullies: obesity, asthma, gayness, lesbianism, intellectualism, artistic orientation, anything and the rest. Bullies are like ticks in the woods: they jump on anything that has warm blood and that goes by. They are absolutely not discriminating: just any animal that is not a tick and that has a warm body.

Bullies are the ticks of education and there is no remedy except extermination but that is said to be unacceptable though it could be a good humanistic decision. Of course the death penalty is banned, but the extermination of that pest by putting them in special work camps, all together to produce shredded paper or cardboard, or whatever, to insulate houses. That would be useful and they would be able to relieve their nerves and release their tension.

The film is excellent because till the very last scene you will not know who the killer is. The killer is officially someone who hanged himself because he was bullied to an extreme point that made it unbearable, a point that is beyond normal imagination: a band of SS with the order of hurting and making the victims suffer but not to kill or maim them.

All the gang of bullies and their ""friends"" will be executed and at the same time text messages will be constantly sent to the telephones of the bullies and videos of their bullying and of their end will be broadcast on an Internet site. Who is behind? No one can know and no one wants to know since the last one of them all is not killed but set up to be caught by the police as the killer of the last but one who is just plain dead assassinated.

I guess forensics will have a hard task to sort out the evidence to prove that last one did not kill them all, though that last one cannot even deny it. That's what a set-up is all about: you cannot evade the obvious situation you find yourself in.

No one can imagine what bullying is if one has not been the victim of it. That's what the film tells in letters of blood like the famous REDRUM of Stephen King's ""The Shining"". And yet somewhere the excess of it makes it slightly ironical and sarcastic, as if it were some British black humour. But this time as black as dried blood.

3996914,4,B002VKI6BW,"A nifty little British horror flick that is surprisingly good - with equal dashes of suspense, humor and violence - Tormented, billing itself as ""a slasher movie for the Skins generation,"" is about a set of British high school teens who are attractive, privileged, and rule the school ... and the class nerd they tormented for months, before the kid finally committed suicide.

The film does, in fact, start out at the funeral of Darren Mullet (Calvin Dean) - with the school's head girl, Justine (Tuppence Middleton) in charge of delivering the boy's eulogy. It is painfully obvious, from the start, that Justine didn't know Darren at all, and in fact causes Darren's best friend Jason (Olly Alexander) to disrupt the funeral and call her out.

Afterward, Justine is comforted by fellow classmate Alexis (Dimitri Leonidas), an attractive guy who obviously likes her. Justine likes the attention, and through Alexis is eventually invited into his circle of special friends - led by the vain, manipulative, mean-spirited Bradley (Alex Pettyfer). Turns out, in fact, that Alexis' friends are all a bunch of unlikable creeps - but as they're the cool kids, and as Justine really likes Alexis, she sort of decides to temporarily go along for the ride.

That is, until they start to die, one by one and in violent ways, seemingly at the hand of Darren Mullet - who has come back from the grave to enact his revenge. As Justine slowly learns just what role her new friends had in Darren's suicide, the body count rises and Justine learns that she may have not only been added to the list ... but moved to the top of it.

On the surface, Tormented might seem just like any other slasher/horror flick, but there are some really cool, subtle differences; little tweaks that make the film unique in its own way. You get some nice insight to Darren Mullet while he was alive, via video footage, and see the bulky, overweight asthmatic being tormented by his classmates ... which makes things more surreal later when, though Darren is dead, he still uses his inhaler to breathe. I also very much liked Alexis' character (and Dimitri Leonidas, who as Alexis is one of the best reasons to watch the film); without him acting as the bridge between Justine and his nasty friends, you wouldn't give a damn about the friends when they start dying. It's Alexis' regret over what happened, his desire to repent for what he and his friends did to Darren while Darren was alive, that makes you even remotely care about what happens to the others, in the end. And though there are a couple of fairly violent scenes, the film isn't a total gorefest like so many of its American counterparts have become. Even the humor is well-done, self-deprecating and keeping things a little light in between all the scares and giving the film a nice balance.

Overall, the film is a nice little thriller about the ghosts that come back to haunt us - in this case, literally. A really enjoyable thriller, with a good-looking cast of victims.",1327190400,,3003,4.745210727969349

This take on it is some what sexualized, but the student body aren't the only bullies in this film, most of the teachers are idiots, esp. the coach, picking on Darren's only friend Jason. In Carrie, yes, the teachers weren't all mean to her, just annoyed her in subtle ways...at first), but in this film, the coach was almost as cruel as the students to everyone who didn't fit into his criteria, and he wasn't afraid to express his disgust, nor did he care. Most of Darren's victims, I had no sympathy for and for me, this film isn't a love or hate, it was just likable and fair, the three stars isn't a rating I give lightly, but if you like the outcast revenge plot, it may interest you, still it's a matter of personal taste.",1442188800,,925,4.261363636363637

8382228,2,B002VKI6BW,"After watching this film, I'm still not sure if the title, Tormented, refers to the students of the featured High School, or the audience that had to sit through this film. Tormented is one of these films that has a deeper meaning, but it takes it's message to such extremes, that it becomes completely obsolete. Tormented is actually an anti-bullying film, that features an obese teenager, that has committed suicide after years of abuse. Instead of focusing on the ones left behind, the story instead focuses on the popular kids, who continue to ""torment"" the kid after he's gone, that is until his ghost shows up looking for revenge. The story isn't the worst idea I've ever heard of, but the film was so fake and over the top that it just ruined all it's credibility. Tormented features a fully functional ghost, with emotions, who gruesomely kills people. The special effects that show him as a ghost and the ridiculous amounts of kool-aid blood, were just some of the worst I've ever seen. Magic Mike's Alex Pettyfer stars as the bully and much like the rest of the cast, is far too old to be playing a high school student. Films like this are low budget, and I understand they need a person of name in order to be recognized, but I've always felt that they should cast real teenagers, and give them a chance at breaking into the business, rather than have the roles played by actors that are pushing thirty! Tormented is exactly how you'll feel as this film plays to the lowest common denominator, assuming that only ignorant people are going to watch it. They'll do things like call the victim, Shrek and show goth kids who think it's cool that he killed himself. Tormented is not funny, scary, or anything but a complete waste of time.",1409443200,,1744,4.629032258064516
