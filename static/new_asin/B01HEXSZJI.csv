7786410,4,B01HEXSZJI,Ok movie.,1474934400,,9,4.0
7786411,1,B01HEXSZJI,"Honey 1 is the best movie of this franchise. Honey 2 was a little too cheesy and some of the dancers could not act to save their lives especially Beau Casper Smart who played 'Ricky' and Christopher Shazar who played 'Luis'. The final dance in Honey 1 was the best.

Honey 3 was set in South Africa but there was no real explanation why both Cassie's character Melea and her boyfriend Eric played by dancer and actor Kenny Wormald, are living and studying in South Africa. Most of the supporting cast cannot really act, which I have come to accept is the norm in these dance movies. They find good dancers who just cannot act and talk like they are reading their lines off cue cards.

The film dragged from start to finish. The dancing was ok but the final performance was NOT exciting.

There was a lot of dancing and in one or two scenes it was just weird how a character just started dancing while they were having a conversation. It was like the scriptwriter and director did not know how to direct these dancers. They did not know how to build the drama, write interesting dialogue and create a compelling story so they added dancing in every other scene.

The main antagonist Ishani played by Sibongile Mlambo was annoying throughout most of the movie.

Best thing was the music, especially Cassie's song 'Joint' and Grizzy 'Look like you'.

Unfortunately Cassie and Kenny Wormald have very little chemistry. It's a shame because he's so cute and she's so pretty and they could have tried a little harder to work on looking like a real couple in the movie. Kenny had more chemistry with his co-stars in Center stage 2 and Footloose.

Ishani had no real reason to dislike Melea in the first place. I wanted to skip Ishani's scenes because she started to bore me with her attitude.

I did not believe Ishani's later love story, although I had a feeling it was going in that direction. I did not buy into this goodlooking musician from the states,Taj suddenly having feelings for this bully who was quite unappealing, in my opinion.

Everything fell into place and was resolved too easily. Melea finds a perfect place to use too quickly, her relationship with Ishani changed overnight, this successful musician is just going to say yes to making music for her play just like that, I don't think it took more than a day for her and her boyfriend to break up and get back together.

There was no surprises, no exciting twists to the story.",1474502400,,2808,5.2271714922049

7786413,1,B01HEXSZJI,"Thank God I didn't purchase this horrible film! I watched it on Netflix and man not only a complete waste of time but so disappointed. Don't get me wrong I love Cassie that's part of the reason why I even bothered to watch it on top of I enjoyed ""Honey 2"" with Kat Graham. Kat's version/story was so much better and watchable, besides Cassie's no point in making this Hip-hop Romeo and Juliet corny mess.",1473724800,,404,4.4
