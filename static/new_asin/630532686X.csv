8555783,2,630532686X,"""Scream Your Head Off"" is best-known for having been excerpted in ""Night Train to Terror""--that crazy, irresistible bit of madness that made hash as well as an omnibus-film out of three other features...including ""Scream,"" which was supposedly then considered an unfinished film.  I actually thought that ""Train""'s first segment--the one culled from this now available-on-videotape movie--was its best: Very much an unapologetically vulgar EC Comics horror cartoon, an innocently adolescent sex-and-violence campfire story.  And now we've got the unabridged version...and, well, what do you know...?  ""Night Train""'s editors really *did* pick out all the best parts.  What's left is mostly padding...a movie that a bad-film afficionado might find things in which to love--but most bad-film fans will have already seen the best parts.  It has it's moments, though!  A tour through the mad-scientist asylum's meat-freezer (what do you think they keep in there?) is an inspired, over-the-top moment of Grand Guinol.",1069891200,4,1012,5.66887417218543
