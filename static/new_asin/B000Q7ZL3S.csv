8194980,5,B000Q7ZL3S,This is one of the best shows I've ever seen on television. It is about a group of kids that were on a school trip flying when their plane crashes on a deserted island. They must use what they know in order to survive. Will they make it off of the island alive? I don't know yet. I haven't finished the show but I'm sure the ending will be great. This show would be great for the whole family. Any age will enjoy watching this! Stars Corbin Bleu from the High School Musical franchise.,1358208000,,485,4.170212765957447
